    "brodsky , j.  tim londergan , and adam p. szczepaniak , a talk @xcite with the title _ `` regge behavior in dvcs : non - factorizability and j = 0 fixed pole '' _ in which it was stated that regge behavior is responsible for the breakdown of collinear factorization .",
    "d.m .  likes to take the opportunity here to repeat his comment , given after the dis 2009 summary talk _ `` structure functions and low-@xmath0 '' _ , that this speculation is based on a `` bad '' gpd model .",
    "further clarifications , e.g. , that the illness of this `` bad '' gpd model arises from the ultraviolet / infrared region rather than from the regge behavior , how to formulate a `` good '' gpd model in the reggeized parton model framework , and how to fix a `` bad '' gpd model within analytic regularization , are presented in ref .",
    "interestingly , the authors find it not legitimate to use analytic regularization to fix their model , however , suggest the same regularization to extract a so - called @xmath73 pole within the gpd formalism that , according to them , can not be applied to dvcs ( i.e. , small @xmath74 ) .",
    "in contrast to the collinear factorization approach @xcite , it could not be demonstrated so far that the regge exchange amplitude model , introduced two years ago , describes dvcs data . in our opinion",
    "the reason is simple , namely , the regge exchange amplitude model is already ruled out by h1 and zeus data @xcite and maybe also by the fact that the scaling hypothesis works rather well in a global fit to fixed target dvcs measurements @xcite . thereby , a ` partonic dispersion relation ' approach is utilized .",
    "since some clarification is still needed , see conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we like to spell out again , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein , that our uses of ` partonic dispersion relations ' is in _ one - to - one _ correspondence to the collinear factorization approach , taken in the lo approximation and supplemented with the scaling hypothesis .",

    "<S> we analyze small-@xmath0 dvcs data using flexible gpd models and compare our outcome with the full shuvaev transformation . </S>",

    "<S> some mathematical subtleties of conformal representations are recalled . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on a speculation of a factorization breakdown in dvcs .    deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , @xmath1 , is viewed as the cleanest process to access generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , which encode a partonic description of the nucleon structure . in the kinematics of h1 and zeus collider experiments at hera , </S>",
    "<S> the dvcs cross section is to a large extent dominated by the flavor singlet part of the helicity conserved compton form factor ( cff ) , denoted as @xmath2 : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the c.o.m .  </S>",
    "<S> energy , @xmath5 is the momentum transfer , @xmath6 is the incident photon virtuality , and @xmath7 is a bjorken - like scaling variable .    </S>",
    "<S> the cff @xmath8 factorizes further into a convolution of the partonic , i.e. , hard scattering , amplitude @xmath9 and gpds @xmath10 , ( @xmath11=singlet quark , @xmath12=gluon ) , @xmath13 where the skewness parameter @xmath14 is set equal to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization scale @xmath16 separates short- and long - distance dynamics and is often taken as @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence is governed by evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> note that gluons do not directly enter the dvcs amplitude at leading order ( lo ) , but rather drive the evolution of singlet quarks . </S>",
    "<S> since the momentum fraction @xmath0 is integrated out in ( [ eq : conv ] ) , gpds can not be directly revealed .    </S>",
    "<S> it is our objective to find flexible gpd models , which satisfy the known theoretical constraints , and which can be pinned down by fits to h1 and zeus dvcs data @xcite at lo and beyond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , we find it convenient to work with conformal gpd moments . for _ integral </S>",
    "<S> _ conformal spin @xmath18 they are defined by convolution with gegenbauer polynomials @xmath19 , e.g. , for quarks : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the flavor index . in the forward limit @xmath22 these moments simply reduce for @xmath23 to familiar @xmath24 mellin moments of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> conformal symmetry guarantees that they evolve autonomously under evolution at lo ( except for the quark - gluon mixing ) . </S>",
    "<S> now we require an appropriate behavior of the conformal moments ( [ eq : defconf ] ) for @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> carlson s theorem then states that their analytic continuation with respect to @xmath27 is unique and the gpd moments can be used to calculate the corresponding cff , cf .  </S>",

    "<S> the singularities of the integrand , except for those of @xmath29 at @xmath30 , lie on the l.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> of the integration path .    to get flexible gpds and cff @xmath31 and to make ( loose ) contact with regge terminology @xcite , we expand their moments in terms of @xmath32-channel so(3 ) partial waves ( pws ) @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 which are labelled by the @xmath32-channel angular momentum @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> these pws can be expressed in terms of the familiar legendre polynomials , where the cosine of the scattering angle @xmath36 may be approximated by @xmath37 and which are normalized to one for @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we include an effective `` pomeron '' pole at @xmath39 in the pw amplitudes and parameterize the residual @xmath32-dependence @xmath40 by a dipole or exponential ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> the strengths @xmath41 of leading @xmath42 pws and the intercept @xmath43 are obtained from fits to some dis data , and the remaining parameter space is further reduced by either truncation of the sum ( [ eq : so3 ] ) or its model dependent resummation , so - called @xmath11-pw model , and is constrained by dvcs fits , which turn out to have good quality @xmath44 , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> lo fit to the dvcs cross section from h1 and zeus versus @xmath4 ( left ) and @xmath46 ( right ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> one important partonic quantity that can be extracted from such fits is the skewness ratio of gpds , which is given by the value of the skewness function at @xmath47 : @xmath48    before we present results of our fits , some issues should be clarified . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that there are at least four different conformal gpd representations that are general and are used in phenomenology : shuvaev - noritzsch dvcs data at lo . </S>",
    "<S> thus ,  not only to avoid confusion  we name the _ general _ integral transformation shuvaev - noritzsch . ] </S>",
    "<S> transformation @xcite ,  dual \" parameterization @xcite , and two versions of mellin - barnes representations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of them start from an integral conformal sl(2 @xmath49 ) pw expansion of the ( crossed ) gpd in terms of gegenbauer polynomials ( now viewed as generalized functions in the mathematical sense ) , @xmath50 however , in the end they provide different representations for gpds . </S>",
    "<S> since these specific conformal representations involve some mathematical subtleties , efforts to understand them have been undertaken in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the one - to - one correspondence among the various representations established already by construction , as sketched    r0.45        by the thick arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transformations ] , although the inverse transformations are only partly known . furthermore , if some mathematical subtleties are ignored , general conformal representations _ degenerate _ to _ parameter - free _ gpd models for the small-@xmath0 region .    in the small-@xmath0 region </S>",
    "<S> the one - to - one correspondence among the different parameter - free models can be analytically shown by noting that they all have the conformal value of skewness function , e.g. , for @xmath51 and fixed @xmath52 @xmath53 assuming , like in most standard pdf parameterizations , that _ effective _ regge behavior is included in the intercept @xmath43 , one easily finds the skewness function ( [ eq : conskerat ] ) from the mellin - barnes representation @xcite of a conformal gpd model @xcite by shifting the original integration path to the l.h.s . in the complex @xmath27-plane , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ def - mb - int ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , the hypergeometric function in ( [ eq : conskerat ] ) is nothing but the clebsch - gordan coefficient of the conformal pw expansion , taken at @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the conformal moments behave smoothly in the vicinity of @xmath55 , a gpd model degenerates to a conformal one . for the full shuvaev transformation model the skewness function ( [ eq : conskerat ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as the standard integral representation of hypergeometric functions , @xmath56    for an effective `` pomeron '' ( @xmath57 ) and `` reggeon '' ( @xmath58 ) pole such analytic approximation works quite well for @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> further singularities ( @xmath60 ) might be taken into account , too . </S>",
    "<S> if the scale grows the effective `` pomeron '' intercept @xmath61 increases , according to the well - known double - log approximation . </S>",
    "<S> if `` reggeon '' contributions still play a role , the analytic approximation of a gpd will of course be a linear combination of conformal skewness functions ( [ eq : conskerat ] ) .    as the reader realizes , for the same small-@xmath0 gpd model two different names are used , or even three if one includes the _ minimalist _ `` dual '' parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> in the remaining part of this presentation we simply adopt the terminology from the `` dual '' parameterization @xcite and use , instead of the term `` parameter - free prediction '' , the term `` minimalist gpd '' for both our conformal and the full shuvaev transformation model . </S>",
    "<S> let us now scrutinize some statements presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and used there to support the problematic idea that the minimalist gpd should be considered as more than just a restricted gpd model @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> i. _ a naive taylor expansion of integral gpd moments around @xmath55 would imply that the shuvaev - noritzsch gpd transform reduces to a pdf at small @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known that the operations of the small-@xmath62 expansion and of an analytic continuation of polynomials with respect to their order do not commute . the sommerfeld - watson transformation of a series , representing a gpd in terms of integral moments , is only possible if the assumptions of the carlson theorem are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the theorem then states that the continuation of conformal moments is unique . </S>",
    "<S> if the integral gpd moments are first reduced to pdf ones , the sommerfeld - watson transformation is not applicable @xcite . that the shuvaev - noritzsch gpd transform might not reduce to a pdf </S>",
    "<S> is known since refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analogue of this in the `` dual '' parameterization framework is the increase of singular behavior of non - leading forward - like functions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> r0.5        _ ii . </S>",
    "<S> _ it was said in @xcite that the absence of poles in the right half of complex @xmath27 plane is a physical requirement that is sufficient to guarantee that the full shuvaev tranformation ( minimalist ) model is the unique gpd model at small @xmath62 to @xmath63 accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we first remark that such a requirement would be _ physical _ only for the angular momentum @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , counterexamples are known , such as resummed @xmath11-pw model used here and in @xcite for dvcs fits . </S>",
    "<S> a small-@xmath62 expansion reveals then that the poles in the right half of complex @xmath27 plane are an artifact of the expansion itself and , thus , should be considered as spurious @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ iii . </S>",
    "<S> _ it was stated in @xcite that up to order @xmath63 the full shuvaev transformation is compatible with the nlo evolution equation in the @xmath64 scheme . however , this is not true , as spelled out , e.g. , in @xcite , and demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : csvsms ] , where we show the nlo evolution of a gpd on @xmath65 both in the @xmath64 scheme and within the procedure @xcite , which actually corresponds to an evolution operator in @xmath66 scheme , as dot - dashed and dashed curves , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one realizes that the discrepancy increases with evolution and with decreasing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it can not be an @xmath63 effect .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological status of a minimalist gpd model was to a large extent discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : shuvaev]a that a flexible model ( solid ) , pinned down by a good @xmath44 fit , is almost two times smaller than a minimalist gpd model , shown by the other curves , and so the latter model is ruled out at lo . </S>",
    "<S> this was also confirmed within the `` dual '' parameterization and standard pdfs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( small shape discrepancy of our minimalist model ( dotted ) and those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( dot - dashed , dashed ) comes from our neglecting of `` reggeon '' contributions . ) at nlo one might conclude from fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : shuvaev]b that within experimental and theoretical uncertainties the minimalist models @xcite ( dot - dashed , dashed ) are compatible with ours ( solid , dot - dot - dashed ) , obtained from data . </S>",
    "<S> still , a more detailed view shows that skewness effect , @xmath32-dependence , and scheme convention are interrelated . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we found that in @xmath64 scheme the @xmath11-pw model with dipole @xmath32-dependence ( dot - dot - dashed ) is somewhat away from a minimalist one ( which provided only @xmath67 ) . on the other hand in the @xmath66 scheme at nlo ( solid ) and </S>",
    "<S> nnlo it turned out to be close to a minimalist one . </S>",
    "<S> we add that the error from the wrong evolution , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : csvsms ] , is comparable to the pdf uncertainties and that for the kinematical region of interest even the forward evolution operator is not stable in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> note that the reparameterization effects for our quark gpd models , resulting from switching on nlo corrections , are much larger than for pdfs . we view this as a sign that in our modelling we have not yet reached control over evolution .     </S>",
    "<S> sea quark gpds on the cross - over line obtained from good fits in @xmath68 ( solid ) and @xmath69 ( dot - dot - dashed ) schemes are compared with minimalist gpd models used in our bad @xmath70 lo fit ( dotted ) and from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( dashed , dot - dashed ) at lo ( left ) and nlo ( right ) . ]    in conclusion , the full shuvaev transform is a minimalist gpd model valid at small-@xmath0 , which is also realized in other versions of conformal representations . </S>",
    "<S> so far we see no general theoretical arguments that support preference of this model over others . </S>",
    "<S> nlo evolution is performed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in such a way that it is inconsistent with the @xmath64 scheme . </S>",
    "<S> a minimalist model might describe dvcs data at nlo , however , not necessarily when precision level is reached . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we recall that the skewness effect for gluons is in all popular gpd models approximately the same , namely , zero ( i.e. @xmath71 ; what is often quoted as a large skewness effect is @xmath72 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the skewness model uncertainty , compared to the phenomenological pdf uncertainty , might presumably be considered as small at nlo . </S>",
    "<S> fully flexible gpd models , allowing the control over evolution , should be invented and confronted with dvcs data in further studies . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that more dvcs hera ii run data will become available and so the statistical errors will be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this might then allow to address the observables and partonic quantities , as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>"
