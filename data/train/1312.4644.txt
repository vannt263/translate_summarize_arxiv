    "in the present work , we are interested in the basic building blocks of social interactions , namely dyadic relationships .",
    "our contribution is to introduce a representation of dyadic relationships that realistically matches an existing theory of human social relationships , relational models theory ( rmt ) and can be used for theoretical purposes . moreover ,",
    "we discuss how to apply our model to computational modeling and analysis .",
    "our model is based on the fundamental assumption that , in any dyadic interaction , each individual can do either the same thing as the other individual , a different thing , or nothing at all . to represent these three possibilities , it is sufficient to consider that each agent can do x , y or nothing ( @xmath0 ) to the other agent .",
    "x and y are two different  social actions , \" in the sense that they intentionally affect their target .",
    "social actions can have positive or negative effects on the receiver s welfare .",
    "for example , an agent a could transfer a useful commodity to an agent b , or a could hit and harm b. in what follows , we generally assume that an agent is a person , but it can also represent a social group ( e.g. a company , team , nation and so on ) that acts as a single entity in specific interactions .",
    "this setting is represented by @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , an interaction in which a does x and b does y is represented by @xmath2 .",
    "we call the arrows in these symbols  action fluxes . \"",
    "that model generates a number of possible relationships between the two agents a and b.    we find that these relationships aggregate into exactly six disjoint categories of action fluxes .",
    "these six categories describe all possible relationships arising from our model , singly or in combination .",
    "we propose a mapping between these categories and the four basic social relationships , or relational models ( rms ) , defined by rmt .",
    "namely , four of the six categories map to the rms , while the remaining two correspond to asocial and null interactions .",
    "we argue that this categorization and mapping show that the rms constitute an exhaustive set of coordinated dyadic social relationships . to take into account",
    "that real social interactions involve an infinite variety of social actions , we generalize our model to the presence of any number n of social actions and show that this leads to the same six categories of action fluxes .",
    "relational models theory was introduced by alan fiske @xcite in the field of anthropology to study how people construct their social relationships .",
    "rmt posits that people use four elementary models to organize most aspects of most social interactions in all societies .",
    "these models are communal sharing , authority ranking , equality matching , and market pricing .",
    "rmt has motivated a considerable amount of research that supports , develops or applies the theory , not only in its original field of social cognition @xcite , but also in diverse disciplines such as neuroscience @xcite , psychopathology @xcite , ethnography @xcite , experimental psychology @xcite , evolutionary social psychology @xcite , and perceptions of justice @xcite , to name a few . for an overview of this research ,",
    "see @xcite .    * in the communal sharing ( cs ) model , people perceive in - group members as equivalent and undifferentiated .",
    "cs relationships are based on principles of unity , identity , conformity and undifferentiated sharing of resources .",
    "decision - making is achieved through consensus .",
    "cs is typically manifested in close family or friendship bonds , teams , nationalities , ethnicities or between soldiers . * in authority ranking ( ar ) relationships , people are asymmetrically ranked in a linear hierarchy .",
    "subordinates are expected to defer , respect and obey high - rankers , who take precedence .",
    "conversely , superiors protect and lead low - rankers .",
    "subordinates are thus not exploited and also benefit from the relationship .",
    "resources are distributed according to ranks and decision - making follows a top - down chain of command . *",
    "equality matching ( em ) relationships are based on a principle of equal balance and one - to - one reciprocity .",
    "salient em manifestations are turn - taking , democratic voting ( one person , one vote ) , in - kind reciprocity , coin flipping , distribution of equal shares , and tit - for - tat retaliation . *",
    "the market pricing ( mp ) model is based on a principle of proportionality .",
    "relationships are organized with reference to socially meaningful ratios and rates , such as prices , cost - benefit analyses or time optimization .",
    "rewards and punishment are proportional to merit .",
    "abstract symbols , typically money , are used to represent relative values .",
    "mp relationships are not necessarily individualistic ; for instance , utilitarian judgments seeking the greatest good for the greatest number are manifestations of mp .",
    "the four relational models have in common that they suppose a coordination between individuals with reference to a shared model .",
    "to these , fiske adds two limiting cases that do not involve any other - regarding abilities or coordination @xcite ( pp .",
    "19 - 20 ) :    * in asocial interactions , a person exploits others and treats them as animate objects or means to an end ( as in psychopathy , armed robbery , pillage ) ; * in null  interactions , \" people do not interact at all ( they do not actively ignore each other , which still requires a coordination ) , as can be the case of two inhabitants of the same building who never cross each other s way or fail to notice each other s existence , and thus do not adapt their actions to each other .    in order to better understand rmt , it is helpful to locate it in the landscape of other social , political and economical theories .",
    "here we follow closely the review made by senior et al .",
    "@xcite of this theoretical landscape .",
    "rmt is identified as a theory of constrained relativism , which lies between the two extremes of rational choice analysis and poststructuralism .",
    "theories belonging to the two latter domains have dominated political science , sociology and economy for several decades , while constrained relativism has had less influence and is not as widely known .",
    "rational choice theory holds that people are fully rational , follow their self - interest and instantly process all available information .",
    "universal analytical models are thus expected to predict the behavior of these rational agents . at the other extreme",
    ", poststructuralism posits that every person , society and epoch , is fundamentally unique . according to that view ,",
    "no generalization can be made ; only descriptions are possible and relevant , without offering any prospect of scientific prediction .    of the two dominant positions , rational choice theory has been favored in many scientific domains , since it calls for the construction of explanatory and predictive models , forbidden by the very definition of poststructuralism . yet",
    "alternatives to rational choice theory are on the rise , as it is apparent that people are strongly ( and primarily ) influenced by emotions , feelings and subconscious processes .",
    "notably , rational choice theory fails at explaining or predicting major social , economical or political events , such as financial bubbles and crashes , or social and political revolutions .    occupying the middle ground between the two extremes of rational choice theory and poststructuralism , theories of constrained relativism",
    "are based on the idea that there is a limited number of elementary ways of organizing social relations that serve as building blocks for the infinitely varied aspects of social and political life .",
    "theories of constrained relativism other than rmt are , in particular , the theory of socio - cultural viability ( or cultural theory ) initiated by mary douglas and developed further by others @xcite and jonathan haidt s moral foundations theory @xcite , among others .    until now , the focus of rmt was on people and relationships rather than on abstract representations of the social actions instantiated within relationships .",
    "a common point of previous approaches of rmt is that they define the rms as _ cognitive _ models .",
    "correspondingly , their implementation has been described in terms of how people mentally represent their relationships , using concepts like group belonging ( cs ) , asymmetrical hierarchies ( ar ) , peer equality ( em ) and cost - benefit calculations ( mp ) .",
    "formally , the rms were compared to the four measuring scales defined by stevens @xcite : nominal ( cs ) , ordinal ( ar ) , interval ( em ) and ratio ( mp ) @xcite ( pp .",
    "210 - 223 ) .",
    "all of this made any attempt to understand why and how people from widely different cultures manage to coordinate using these same psychological concepts a very ambitious undertaking , and naturally led to consider the evolution and functioning of the human brain , as did bolender @xcite and iacoboni et al .",
    "@xcite , for instance .",
    "nettle et al .",
    "@xcite recently opened the way to model what is being transferred from one individual to another .",
    "the authors defined three strategies to allocate a resource between two individuals .",
    "they presented one of the strategies as typifying cs .",
    "their result was to determine the domain of parameters making each strategy evolutionarily stable . in an analogous modeling spirit",
    ", our approach offers an abstract representation of the patterns of social actions performed by dyads in all four relational models , as well as the asocial and null interactions .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in the method , we present our model of action fluxes . in the results ,",
    "we demonstrate the exhaustiveness of the six categories arising from that representation , and match the categories to the four relational models and the asocial and null interactions .",
    "we then generalize the finding of these six categories to the situation involving any number n of social actions . in the discussion",
    ", we touch on a method to analyze and interpret data sets of dyadic social interactions . we also express a hypothesis about how social actions are valued and matched by the agents .",
    "we consider a model of two agents interacting through social actions .",
    "a social action corresponds to any action intentionally targeting the receiver and affecting her welfare positively or negatively .",
    "it can consist in the transfer of commodities ( e.g. objects , food , water , etc . ) or services , but can also be a comforting act , talking , harm , violence , and so on .",
    "let a and b be two distinct agents , and x and y different social actions .",
    "in general , we assume that a and b are two people .",
    "however , an agent can also represent a group that acts as a social unit toward a person or another group ( e.g. a nation , in the context of its diplomatic relation with another nation ) .",
    "we posit that each agent can act in one out of three ways toward the other agent : do x , y or nothing ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the idea at the root of our model is that , in general , each individual in a dyadic interaction can do either the same thing as the other individual , a different thing , or nothing at all .",
    "hence the three possibilities x , y and @xmath0 are sufficient to abstractly describe what can happen in any given interaction between two individuals .",
    "namely , if they do the same thing , they both do x ( or y ) ; if they perform different ( non - null ) actions , one does x and the other does y. our setting is represented by @xmath1 .",
    "we call  action fluxes \" the arrows in that symbol .",
    "the setting @xmath1 generates nine cases shown in table [ 9poss_table ] that we call  elementary interactions \" or just  interactions .",
    "\" the bottom right case of that table corresponds to the null interaction .",
    "for example , the elementary interaction @xmath2 means that agent a does x to b , and agent b does y to a. the elementary interaction @xmath3 means that agent a does x to b , without any linked flux going reciprocally from b to a. for convenience of notations , we reduce this symbol to @xmath4 .",
    "table [ 9poss_table2 ] shows this simplified notation for the interactions with one empty flux ( i.e. one null action , @xmath0 ) .    .",
    "* nine elementary interactions * [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     patterns of action fluxes expected to be observed in each category . x and y",
    "are social actions belonging to a set @xmath5 of size n. a and b are agents .",
    "[ fluxes_table ]    let us stress the following points :    * the patterns of observed fluxes given in table [ fluxes_table ] are not meant as definitions of the categories .",
    "they rather correspond to properties of the fluxes in each category . * linked to the previous point , we stress that the patterns given in that table are not mutually disjoint .",
    "they should thus be tested in a certain order .",
    "mp should be tested before ar and cs , and category 6 ( asocial ) should be tested after all other categories .",
    "let us illustrate that point with an example : if a and b are in an mp relationship , one observes alternated fluxes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as well as alternated fluxes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , re - written as [ @xmath2 and @xmath10 . yet , a and b s relationship will also respond positive to a cs test , because non - alternated fluxes @xmath6 and @xmath9 are present overall in the relationship ( indicative of cs for x ) , as well as non - alternated fluxes @xmath8 and @xmath7 ( cs for y ) . in that case , the alternation that marks an mp relationship should prevail in the observer s interpretation because it is very unlikely to happen by chance alone .",
    "* a tolerance level should be defined for the alternation of fluxes ( in em , mp and ar ) .",
    "for instance , the alternation of fluxes in an em relationship does not need to be strict . in real conditions",
    ", people can be flexible and take several turns in a row before the other party reciprocates .",
    "occasional cheating or inexact record keeping can also occur within an otherwise stable relationship .",
    "hence , a low tolerance could lead to false negatives , whereby the observer would miss situations of em , mp and ar .",
    "on the other hand , high tolerance levels might lead to wrong interpretations : fluxes could be falsely interpreted as manifestations of em , mp or ar . the adequate tolerance level may vary per data set or relationship and may be checked against the individuals communications , if available . *",
    "relationships may change over time .",
    "individuals may initiate a certain relationship that transforms over time into another , linked to increased trust ( or mistrust ) , availability of resources in the environment , and so on . to detect such changes , analyses can be carried out over different time windows .",
    "* in any real data set , individuals may belong to larger social units that interact with each other .",
    "if blindly applied to all pairs of individuals , our model may miss these high - level effects .",
    "for instance , say that agent a from group @xmath11 attacked b from group @xmath12 .",
    "agent c from @xmath12 , feeling very close to b ( perhaps in a cs way ) , decides to punish a and attacks her in an eye - for - an - eye , tooth - for - a - tooth fashion ( em ) .",
    "if one knows nothing of the groups existence , one analyzes separately the pairs ( a , b ) and ( a , c ) . from the observations @xmath6 and @xmath13 ,",
    "one concludes to the presence of an asocial interaction ( category 6 ) between a and b , as well as between a and c. if however one knows of the groups and applies our model to the high - level agents @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one observes @xmath14 and interprets it as an em relationship between the two groups .",
    "this example motivates to identify the relevant social units in the data set under study .",
    "this may be achieved by measuring the number and/or duration of interactions between all pairs of individuals and thus creating a weighted graph . by choosing a threshold for the weight of the links ,",
    "one may be able to isolate social units .",
    "our model would then apply to pairs of members of the same social unit , as well as to pairs of social units .",
    "our fluxes representation reflects only the presence or absence of fluxes , without saying anything about the quantities involved .",
    "the amount carried by an action flux can be readily measured when the action consists in the transfer of a physical item for which a unit of measure can easily be agreed upon .",
    "valuing an action in general is not straightforward . the average time or physical effort necessary to perform the action can be measured ( or simply intuitively approximated ) , but it is naturally much harder to quantitatively agree on a possible emotional or intellectual value .",
    "we propose that a value function does not need to be identical for each agent , and each agent does not need to possess a fixed , deterministic value function . for our present needs , it is sufficient for each agent to have personal notions of the value of the social actions performed by herself and others .",
    "these personal scales may be probabilistic , in the sense that the value they return may follow probability distributions . correspondingly , decisions may be probabilistic , as suggested by quantum decision theory @xcite . alternatively",
    ", a value function could be a von neumann - morgenstern utility @xcite , a subjective cumulative prospect utility @xcite , or any other value function capturing different forms of happiness or contentment , as in the theory of utilitarianism @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that , in a population of interacting agents evolving under selective pressure , the action fluxes of our model converge toward equilibria characterized by an equality in value between opposite fluxes .",
    "this proposition rests on the idea that unequal fluxes disadvantage at least one party .",
    "they are thus likely to jeopardize the relationship in the short term ( in case of inequity aversion ) , and hinder the survival or reproductive success of the disadvantaged party in the long run .",
    "hence , both individual optimization and selection pressure from external forces in the environment should drive interactions toward stable equilibria characterized by value equalities .",
    "we expect these equilibria to depend upon initial conditions and previous states .",
    "in other words , different societies would estimate that different things or actions have equal values .",
    "let us now examine this suggestion in relation to rmt .",
    "mp requires a formal matching agreement stating the respective values of what is exchanged , whether actions ( such as work ) , commodities or symbolic items ( e.g. money ) .",
    "in em , the things exchanged are not only of the same nature , but also of the same value .",
    "thus , the idea of value equalities is already embedded into the definitions of these two rms .",
    "rmt keeps cs and ar apart by stating that these rms are not supposed to necessitate any kind of counting",
    ". it may be the case that cs relationships are established only between individuals so close that individual optimization does not occur , such that these relationships may not need to rest on equal contributions overall .",
    "for its part , the rmt definition of ar is based on the presence of a linear hierarchy and states that superiors generally get more and better things , but have the obligation to act generously according to the principle  noblesse oblige \" @xcite ( pp .",
    "42 - 43 ) .",
    "there is a deep principle of asymmetry and inequality , expressed for instance in @xcite ( pp .",
    "343 - 344 ) :  when people transfer things from person to person in an ar mode , higher - ranking people get more and better things , and get them sooner , than their subordinates",
    ". higher - ranking people may preempt rare or valuable items , so that inferior people get none at all . \" in that quote , only one side of the relationship is looked at , namely what the higher - ranking people get from subordinates . yet",
    "ar relationships entail an exchange of protection ( or management , etc . ) in return for obedience , loyalty , tax payments , and so on . in our representation",
    ", the equality would be between the protection offered by the leader and the obedience of the subordinates , whereby the leader may well get  more and better things , \" but matching in value the safety she offers to her subjects .",
    "nevertheless , it may be that respective contributions match only in idealized ar relationships , because in practice it is difficult for subordinates to monitor and enforce equality in an essentially asymmetrical relationship .",
    "another point concerning ar is that , according to fiske @xcite ( p. 209 ) , the distance between ranks is not socially meaningful ; only the linear ordering of ranks is ( i.e. which rank is higher , without specifying how much higher ) . yet , a value function would allow to measure the distance between ranks .",
    "we point out that just because a value function is introduced does not mean that the use of ar requires any computation from the agents . just as we adapt our every move to the law of gravity without solving mentally at each instant the corresponding equations , or as dogs catch frisbees using simple heuristics @xcite , it is perfectly conceivable that we are able to recognize and interact with individuals of different ranks without using or having defined any measure of ranks differences or action values . in the case of humans ,",
    "these heuristics are facilitated by evolved language and culture , which permit the existence of predefined roles ( for instance  chief \" or ",
    "servitor \" ) offering an idea of what is expected from each party .",
    "an agent - based model would be a convenient approach to observe and test the evolution of a system toward value equalities . naturally , it would also be of high interest to examine real social relationships in the making .",
    "this , however , raises practical difficulties such as the fact that even new relationships develop within a cultural context that largely predefines how rms should be implemented , making transient forms unlikely to occur or last long enough to be observed .",
    "we introduced a model of social interactions between a pair of individuals a and b , each of whom can perform a social action x , y or nothing , symbolized by @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrated that from this setting arise six exhaustive and disjoint categories of relationships , four of which match the relational models of rmt , while the remaining two are identified as the asocial and the null interactions .",
    "we generalized this categorization to the case of any number n of social actions .",
    "we proposed that the categories of action fluxes offer suitable abstract representations of the social actions performed by dyads implementing the relational models .",
    "hence , simulated or real dyads may exhibit various patterns of interactions that can be matched to the six categories of action fluxes , singly or in combination . in that spirit",
    ", we discussed a method to identify relational models , expressed as categories of action fluxes , in data sets of dyadic interactions . finally , we expressed a hypothesis about how social actions are valued and matched by the agents .",
    "our representation can be used to interpret social relationships in terms of rmt and test various hypotheses on dyadic social interactions occurring in potentially large data sets .",
    "we are grateful to alan fiske for numerous discussions both at ucla and zrich , which helped shape and refine our understanding of rmt .",
    "we thank alexandru babeanu for his thorough review of our model and marco verweij for stimulating debates .",
