    "this model works well irrespective of the strength of the emitter - emitter interaction but it is limited to weak excitations .",
    "it is , for example , able to describe collective effects in dense atomic vapors@xcite .",

    "indeed , it is evident from eqs.([g1 ] ) and([g2 ] ) that the empirical gain and decay factors chosen to mimic the dynamics of the system diverge when the exited state is populated at @xmath35 .",

[ ] .     composed of identical two - level emitters is exposed to a laser pulse .",
    "a part of the em field is reflected and the remaining part is either transmitted through or absorbed by the layer of emitters.,width=321 ]    the dynamics of the em field @xmath49 and @xmath50 is described by maxwell s equations in the time domain    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the permeability and permittivity of the free space , respectively .",
    "these equations are implemented and solved using a generalized finite - difference time - domain technique where both the electric and magnetic fields are propagated in discretized spatial and temporal grids as described in ref .",
    "the interaction of the em fields with the two - level emitters polarizes the medium giving rise to a macroscopic polarization @xmath54 which is related to the microscopic transition dipoles @xmath55 via @xmath56 where @xmath57 stands for the expectation value of the point - wise dipole at position @xmath45 and time @xmath58 . the polarization of the medium results in a modification of the effective local electric field .",

    "this is especially important when the system density increases .",
    "it can be done by defining the local field @xmath59 experienced by the emitters using the well - known lorentz - lorenz correction@xcite , @xmath60    the polarization @xmath54 of eq.([polarization ] ) is the link between the field dynamics described by eqs.([faraday ] ) and([ampere ] ) and the quantum description of the system@xcite .",

    "the response of the system towards the incident field is finally calculated as a function of the relative detuning @xmath75 .",
    "media composed of a large number of interacting dipoles can respond to the incident em field in a collective manner due to the strong dipole - dipole interactions . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "[ ] for the same kind of geometry in the linear excitation regime , the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction can be quantified by a dimensionless parameter @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",

    ", the system is excited with a laser pulse of small amplitude @xmath80 . for the numerical simulations we have chosen @xmath81v / m , such that the system responds linearly to the field with an excitation probability much smaller than one .",
    "if the density is small , the atoms respond almost independently . on the contrary ,",
    "in the strong interaction regime reached at large densities , dipole - dipole interactions alter the response of the system , resulting in a dramatic change of reflection and transmission spectra .",

    "the transmitted pulse is almost identical to the incident pulse due to the weak reflection and weak excitation of the system .",
    "one can notice that the three models agree perfectly irrespective of the different descriptions of coherences that are taken into account , even in the strong interaction regime which is shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "in this regime , the system responds like a dissipative mirror near the transition energy even though it is weakly excited@xcite .",

    "initially , the excited state populations shown in panel ( a ) and described by the two non - hermitian models follow the _ exact _ dynamics but they decay far too quickly since in this particular case @xmath26 quickly exceeds @xmath11 . on the contrary ,",
    "the evolution of the coherences shown in panel ( b ) are identical in the different models considered .",
    "this ensure a correct description of the system s optical response since the macroscopic polarization is proportional to the coherence in the linear regime .",
    "it is also worth noticing in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.[fig_pop_coh ] that the excited state populations and the coherences of nh1 and nh2 models show the same evolution .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the weak excitation limit , _ i.e _ @xmath86 , the decay rates @xmath26 of these two models are identical .",
    "it was already mentioned that nh1 model is expected to fail as the intensity of the applied field increases .",
    "this is due to the presence of a pole in the definition([gam ] ) of the gain and decay rates @xmath25 and @xmath26 when @xmath87 .",
    "the improved model nh2 is designed to avoid this unphysical behavior .    to test the validity of nh2 compared to optical bloch equations ,",

    "the reference populations and coherences obtained by integrating optical bloch equations are shown as solid black curves . as expected ,",
    "the nh1 results ( blue dotted curves ) deviate significantly at early times from the optical bloch model , even for the coherences .",
    "it can be noticed that this deviation appears as soon as the system approaches an inversion of population , with @xmath87 .",
    "when the excited state population reaches almost 50% it exhibits fast oscillations proving clearly the inability of nh1 model to attain higher excited state population due to a very fast increase ( divergent pole ) of the empirical gain and decay factors @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "since the populations @xmath89 and @xmath90 are used to evaluate @xmath25 and @xmath26 it affects the accuracy of the coherences in the system , as can be seen in panels ( e ) and ( f ) . in both the weak and strong interaction regimes ,",
    "nh1 model is inadequate for the description of the dynamics initiated by strong fields .    on the other hand ,",
    "as seen in panels ( e ) and ( f ) , the new model nh2 ( dashed red line ) follows perfectly the coherence of the system in both weak and strong interaction regimes in intense fields .",
    "this is obtained at the cost of losing the accuracy in the description of the populations , as we can see in panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .    to see how accurately the non - hermitian models mimic the coherence dynamics of two - level systems in strong fields , the difference @xmath91 of the coherence calculated using the optical bloch equations and using the non - hermitian models are shown in fig.[fig_error_coh ] in a semi - logarithmic scale .     in strong field dynamics .",

    "panel ( a ) shows the comparison in the weak interaction regime and panel ( b ) shows the comparison in the strong interaction regime .",
    "it is clear that the introduction of nh2 model improves greatly the error , which is always smaller than 1% , in comparison with the previous model whose accuracy is not acceptable in strong fields . finally , the calculated optical response of the system is shown in fig.[fig_strong_field ] .",

    "the black curves are the results of the maxwell - liouville model .",
    "the red marks , which are the results of nh2 model , are always in very good agreement , thus validating the approximations made to derive the empirical gain and decays factors in nh2 model .    in the weak interaction regime ,",
    "the system transmits almost all the incident energy .",
    "this is the reason for the agreement of the transmitted pulse obtained with nh1 model ( dashed blue curve ) in panel ( b ) .",
    "however , for the reflection seen in panel ( a ) , even if it is small , nh1 model shows a clear mismatch with the optical bloch equations , not only in the peak value , but also on the two sidebands which appear due to the strong excitation of the system . on the contrary , nh2 model ( red asterisks ) is in perfect agreement with the optical bloch equations for all values of the detuning .",
    "the failure of nh1 model , and in contrast the striking validity of nh2 model , are even more pronounced when the dipoles interact strongly , as seen in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "along with the nonlinearities introduced by the intense field , the dipole - dipole interactions modify the system response to a large extend@xcite .",
    "all features of the spectra obtained using the bloch optical model are very well reproduced by nh2 model , proving its ability to deal with any interaction regime . in panel ( c )",
    "we see that the transmission is clearly affected by the collective response of the medium@xcite , a feature that the first model fails to reproduce .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed an improved non - hermitian approximation of the optical bloch equations where one propagates the wave function of a quantum system instead of a complete density matrix .",
