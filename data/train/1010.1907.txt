    "in the present paper , we study the following third - order integrable nonlinear evolution equation : @xmath0 this equation was introduced recently by qiao @xcite as the second positive member in a new completely integrable hierarchy . the qiao equation",
    " we will refer to in this way  possesses a lax representation and a bi - hamiltonian structure @xcite .",
    "moreover , the qiao equation may be reduced from the two - dimensional euler equation by an approximation procedure , and its solutions may be useful to construct new solvable potentials in newtonian dynamics and to model electrophysiological phenomena in neuroscience @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting problem concerning the soliton solution of the qiao equation . in @xcite , where the traveling wave solutions of were studied ,",
    "it was stated that this equation has no smooth solitons , and only piecewise smooth , but not smooth , continuous traveling wave solutions were found in those papers . on the other hand , in @xcite , where the bifurcations of traveling wave solutions of were studied ,",
    "it was stated that this equation does possess smooth soliton solutions , and some of those solitons were shown in figure  5 of that paper .",
    "we believe that the complexity of investigation of the qiao equation s solitons is caused mainly by the fact that they can be expressed only in a parametric form . in the present paper",
    ", we also address the problem on smooth soliton solutions of , but we do not use the traveling wave reduction to an ordinary differential equation . instead , we follow the way used in @xcite for the short pulse equation : we transform the studied new equation into a known old one , and then transform known explicit expressions for solutions of the old equation into sought parametric expressions for solutions of the new one .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ] , we find a transformation which relates the qiao equation with the well - known modified korteweg  de  vries ( mkdv ) equation .",
    "then , in sections  [ s3 ] and  [ s4 ] , we apply this transformation , respectively , to the rational solution and to the soliton solution of the mkdv equation , and in this way we obtain three types of smooth solitons of the qiao equation as well as three types of its smooth antisolitons .",
    "section  [ s5 ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "let us try to transform the new qiao equation into one of well - studied old equations .",
    "we do this in the way used in @xcite for the fujimoto ",
    "watanabe equations ; see also @xcite for more theory and applications of the transformations involved .",
    "first of all , we transform the nonlinear evolution equation , which has the form @xmath1 , into an equation of the form @xmath2 . to do this",
    ", we change in the dependent variable @xmath3 as @xmath4 the result being the polynomial evolution equation @xmath5 this equation is just a special case of the item ( ii.2 ) in the fujimoto ",
    "watanabe classification @xcite , @xmath6 with the arbitrary constant @xmath7 fixed to be @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , according to @xcite , it is possible to relate the qiao equation , through its previously known form , with the korteweg  de  vries equation .",
    "we will see soon , however , that it is more convenient to transform the qiao equation into the mkdv equation , in order to easily derive solutions of the former from solutions of the latter .",
    "next , we take into account that the evolution equation can be written as @xmath9 which means , according to @xcite , that the transformation @xmath10 relates with the third - order evolution equation @xmath11 this point should be explained in more detail .",
    "it is easy to see that any function @xmath12 satisfying determines via a function @xmath13 satisfying . in the opposite direction ,",
    "when we substitute the expressions to , we obtain a fourth - order equation for @xmath12 , which , owing to the form of , can be written as @xmath14 and then can be integrated over @xmath15 , the result being the third - order equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an arbitrary function .",
    "this means that any solution @xmath13 of is represented parametrically , via with @xmath15 being the parameter , by a solution @xmath12 of with some function @xmath17 .",
    "however , we can always fix this function @xmath17 to be zero , by the corresponding change of the parameter @xmath15 , @xmath18 , which has no effect on the represented solution @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , all solutions of are represented by all solutions of via the relations .",
    "finally , we introduce the new dependent variable @xmath19 , @xmath20 which is convenient because the relation @xmath21 holds due to . according to and",
    ", the function @xmath22 is any solution of the mkdv equation @xmath23 whereas the function @xmath12 is determined by @xmath22 via the relations @xmath24 and @xmath25 up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration . of course",
    ", there is no need to further transform into the korteweg  de  vries equation , because it would only complicate the already found way to solve the qiao equation .",
    "we can summarize the obtained transformation , which relates the equations and to each other , as follows .",
    "all solutions of the qiao equation are represented parametrically by all solutions of the mkdv equation via the relations @xmath26 where the independent variable @xmath15 serves as the parameter .",
    "of course , this transformation is local , in the sense that it maps a local solution of to a local solution of , and for every particular @xmath22 some extra analysis is required to see whether the corresponding @xmath27 is real - valued , smooth , and global .    in the next two sections , in order to show how the transformation  works , we apply it to two simplest nontrivial solutions of the mkdv equation : the rational solution @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an arbitrary nonzero constant , and the soliton solution @xmath30 where @xmath29 and @xmath31 are arbitrary constants , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "one can notice that the expressions and are somewhat different from the ones well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the mkdv equation is usually studied in its focusing form , with a positive coefficient at the nonlinear term , whereas we have the defocusing case in , and the expressions and can be obtained from the well - known ones through a complex - valued scale transformation of the dependent variable and a change of notations for the constants .",
    "let us derive a solution of the qiao equation from the rational solution of the mkdv equation by means of the transformation .",
    "we substitute the function @xmath22 given by to the relations and , make the integration required in , and fix the arbitrary additive constant of integration so that to have @xmath34 for @xmath35 . in this way",
    ", we obtain the following expressions : @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the hyperbolic arctangent .",
    "these expressions contain @xmath15 via the variable @xmath38 only , therefore we can use @xmath39 instead of @xmath15 as the parameter , for simplicity .",
    "the function @xmath27 , determined parametrically by  with @xmath39 being the parameter , does satisfy , as one can prove by direct computations .    until now , we worked with the solution in a purely algebraic way , and the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath15 , @xmath40 and @xmath19 could be even complex - valued there .",
    "however , in order that the obtained solution @xmath27  be a real - valued function of real - valued variables , the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath15 and @xmath40 must be real - valued , and the condition @xmath41 must be satisfied , which is caused by the presence of @xmath37 in . the domain of variation of @xmath42 is @xmath43 due to and .",
    "the function @xmath27 , due to and , is everywhere smooth ; it is positive , with one maximum equal to @xmath44 , when @xmath45 ; it is negative , with one minimum equal to @xmath44 , when @xmath46 ; and its asymptotes at @xmath47 are zero .",
    "we can see easily that the obtained solution  is a traveling wave solution , @xmath48 with the function @xmath49 being determined parametrically .",
    "the shape of this solitary wave is close to the shape of a hyperbolic secant curve but not identical to it , as shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "the speed of this solitary wave is equal to @xmath50 ; solitons ( positive waves with @xmath45 ) move to the right , and antisolitons ( negative waves with @xmath46 ) move to the left , as shown in figures  [ f2 ] and  [ f3 ] , respectively .",
    "this antisymmetry @xmath51 between positive and negative solutions of the qiao equation corresponds , via the transformation ",
    ", to the symmetry @xmath52 of the mkdv equation",

    "first , a rational solution of one nonlinear equation is transformed into a smooth soliton solution of another nonlinear equation .",
    "second , only a part of the rational solution of the mkdv equation  the part bounded by the condition is used to produce the entire smooth real solution of the qiao equation .",
    "now , let us proceed to transformation of the soliton solution of the mkdv equation . the cases of `` @xmath56 '' and `` @xmath57 '' signs in will be considered separately .",
    "we substitute the function @xmath22 , with the choice of `` @xmath56 '' sign in it , to the relations and , make the integration required in , fix the constant of integration so that to have @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and obtain in this way the following expressions : @xmath58 these expressions contain @xmath15 via the variable @xmath59 only .",
    "therefore we can use @xmath60 instead of @xmath15 as the parameter , for simplicity , when we consider  as a parametrically determined solution @xmath27 of the qiao equation .",
    "this is a traveling wave solution , @xmath61 with the function @xmath62 being determined parametrically , and the speed of the wave is equal to @xmath63 . of course",
    ", in order that the obtained solution be a real solution , the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath60 and @xmath40 must be real - valued in the right - hand sides of and ( we take @xmath64 without loss of generality ) , and the condition @xmath65 must be satisfied due to the presence of the square root .",
    "further constraints on @xmath60 and @xmath31 , caused by the presence of @xmath37 in and the denominator in , depend on the sign of @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath45 , the parameter @xmath60 must lie in the interval latexmath:[\\[\\label{e21 }    in order that @xmath42 be real - valued . with this constraint on @xmath60 ,",
    "the domain of variation of @xmath42 is @xmath43 , and the function @xmath27 is everywhere smooth and positive , with one maximum equal to @xmath67 and zero asymptotes at @xmath47 .",
    "the soliton , determined by  , moves with the speed @xmath63 to the right , as shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "when @xmath68 , the height and the speed of this soliton tend to @xmath44 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "in fact , the soliton  with @xmath45 , derived from the rational solution of the mkdv equation in section  [ s3 ] , is a limiting case of the soliton  with @xmath68 , as one can prove easily . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath69 , the height and the speed of the soliton ",
    "tend to @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows how the shape of the obtained soliton depends on the ratio @xmath72 .",
    "we see that the soliton s top widens and flattens , when @xmath31 is very close to @xmath29 , that is when the soliton s motion is extremely slow . however , the soliton s shape changes very little , when @xmath31 runs over the wide interval @xmath73 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ f6 ] , where we have adjusted the values of @xmath29 so that to have solitary waves of equal heights .",
    "it is interesting that , of the two solitary waves shown there , the one which is only a little bit wider moves more than two times slower than the other one .     and @xmath74 : @xmath53 ( solid ) and @xmath75 ( dashed).,scaledwidth=72.0% ]     and @xmath53 : @xmath76 ( solid ) , @xmath77 ( dot - dashed ) , @xmath78 ( dashed ) , and @xmath79 ( dotted).,scaledwidth=72.0% ]    : @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( solid ) ; @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( dashed).,scaledwidth=72.0% ]    when @xmath46 in and , the variable @xmath42 is real - valued on the whole interval @xmath84 for any @xmath31 , @xmath85 , and the domain of variation of @xmath42 is @xmath43 , but the function @xmath27 has one or two singularities if @xmath86 or @xmath87 , respectively . the expressions and with @xmath88 do determine a smooth soliton .",
    "this solitary wave is positive , has one maximum equal to @xmath67 and nonzero asymptotes @xmath89 at @xmath47 , and moves with the speed @xmath63 , that is to the left , as shown in figures  [ f7 ] and  [ f8 ] . when @xmath68 , the height of the soliton tends to @xmath89 , which is the level of the asymptotes , and the speed of the soliton tends to @xmath50 .",

    "the obtained solitary waves are negative .",
    "the antisoliton ",
    "moves to the right and has nonzero asymptotes , as shown in figure  [ f9 ] .",
    "it corresponds to the soliton , determined by , and , in the sense of the antisymmetry between positive and negative solutions , discussed in section  [ s3 ] .",
    "the antisoliton , determined by , and , moves to the left and has zero asymptotes , as shown in figure  [ f10 ] .",
    "it corresponds to the soliton  in the sense of that antisymmetry . owing to this correspondence",
    ", there is no need to discuss these antisolitons in more detail .     and @xmath96 : @xmath53 ( solid ) and @xmath97 ( dashed).,scaledwidth=72.0% ]     and @xmath74 : @xmath53 ( solid ) and @xmath75 ( dashed).,scaledwidth=72.0% ]    to conclude the section , we remind the following important observation .",
    "when we used the soliton solution of the mkdv equation to obtain smooth real solutions of the qiao equation , we had to impose certain constraints on the quantities @xmath15 , @xmath40 , @xmath29 and @xmath31 in the original solution , otherwise the obtained solutions would be singular or complex .",
    "in this paper , we found a transformation which relates a new integrable nonlinear evolution equation of qiao with the well - known mkdv equation . by means of that transformation , we derived smooth soliton solutions of the qiao equation from the known rational and soliton solutions of the mkdv equation .",
    "we obtained three types of positive solitary wave solutions , or solitons .",
    "solitons of two types have zero asymptotes and move to the right , whereas solitons of the third type have nonzero asymptotes and move to the left .",
    "also we obtained three types of negative solitary wave solutions , or antisolitons , which have the same shape as the corresponding solitons but differ from them in their sign and direction of motion .",
    "it is remarkable that the rational solution of the mkdv equation is transformed into a smooth soliton solution of the qiao equation .",
    "an important detail of this is that only a part of the rational solution of the mkdv equation produces the entire smooth soliton solution of the qiao equation .",
    "when the soliton solution of the mkdv equation is transformed , it is also necessary to impose certain constraints on its variables and constants , in order that the obtained solution of the qiao equation be real and smooth .",
    "these observations may be important for further development of the method to obtain parametric representations for solutions of nonlinear wave equations via transformations of the equations .",
    "last but not least , we believe that the discovered transformation will be useful to obtain and study multisoliton solutions of the qiao equation with the help of the hirota bilinear representation of the mkdv equation @xcite .",
