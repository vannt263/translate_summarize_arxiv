    "since the beginning of quantum estimation theory@xcite , the research about measurements and estimation strategies for the optimal detection of physical parameters has been a major focus . in particular , the case where the physical parameters to be estimated correspond to the unknown action of some symmetry group has received a constant attention@xcite .",
    "the reason of such interest , that in the last ten years received a strong motivation from the new field of quantum information , is the broad spectrum of applications of the topic , ranging from quantum statistics to quantum cryptography , from the study of uncertainty relations to the design of high sensitivity measurements achieving the ultimate quantum limit .    despite the long - dated attention to the problem ,",
    "many new examples and applications of group parameter estimation came up recently , and , on the other hand , some controversial points have been clarified only in the very last years . in the rich variety of this scenario",
    ", it is somehow natural to look for a general point of view , suitable for capturing the main features of optimal estimation without entering the specific details of the symmetry group involved in the particular problem at hand .    in this paper",
    ", we will show how such kind of general insight can be provided in a simple way in the _ _ maximum likelihood approach__@xcite , where the measurements are designed to maximize the probability of estimating the true value of the unknown group parameter . in this approach ,",
    "the relations between the quality of the estimation and other information theoretic properties , such as the holevo @xmath0quantity@xcite and the dimension of the space spanned by a quantum state under the action of the group become straightforward .",
    "the results of the maximum likelihood method recently allowed to understand the crucial role of the equivalent irreducible representations of the group in the optimal estimation strategy@xcite , giving a striking application of this mechanism with the solution of a long - standing controversy@xcite about the efficiency in the absolute transmission of a cartesian reference frame . in that application",
    ", the technique of equivalent representations has been the key idea for an efficient use of quantum resources .    here",
    "we will show in a general fashion that , far from being a technicality , the use of equivalent representations is synonymous of the use of a unique kind of entanglement that is really suitable for group parameter estimation .",
    "more precisely , such kind of entanglement is the entanglement between spaces where the group acts irreducibly ( _ representation spaces _ ) and spaces where the group acts trivially ( _ multiplicity spaces _ ) .",
    "this entanglement is related only to the group , without any relation with other `` natural '' tensor product structures that can be present in the system , e.g. when the system is made by a set of distinguishable particles .",
    "the concept of representation / multiplicity is well known in the field of quantum error correction@xcite , where the multiplicity spaces are referred to as _ decoherence - free subspaces _ and , more generally , _ noiseless subsystems_. moreover , the same concept has recently found applications also in the context of quantum communication@xcite and cryptography@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the application to quantum estimation of tools such as representation / multiplicity spaces and entanglement is a completely new issue@xcite . in the maximum likelihood approach",
    "the maximal entanglement between representation and multiplicity spaces appears to be the unifying feature of the optimal strategy for any group parameter estimation .",
    "moreover , the validity of this result is not limited to the maximum likelihood estimation , and can be extended to estimation schemes where different figures of merit are considered @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we will present the general approach to group parameter estimation .",
    "we will firstly start with a brief self - contained introduction about group parameter estimation ( 2.1 ) , maximum likelihood approach ( 2.2 ) , group theoretical tools ( 2.3 ) , and covariant measurements ( 2.3 ) .",
    "after that , we will derive in the general setting the optimal measurements ( 2.5 ) , and the optimal states ( 2.6 ) , emphasizing the role of equivalent representations and the relations with the holevo @xmath0quantity .",
    "finally we will conclude the section with a discussion ( 2.7 ) about the use of entanglement with an additional reference system , showing how to efficiently use such resource .    in section 3",
    ", all the results will be generalized to infinite dimension ( subsection 3.1 ) and non - compact groups ( subsection 3.2 ) .",
    "as an example of application , in subsection 3.3 we provide a detailed analysis of the estimation of the joint displacement of two harmonic oscillators in the phase space , underlying in this continuous variable context the connections with the well known example by gisin and popescu about the estimation of a direction using parallel and anti - parallel spins@xcite .",
    "the issue of this paper is the problem of optimally discriminating a family of quantum signal states , which is the orbit generated by a given input state under the action of a group . in other words ,",
    "if the input state is the density matrix @xmath1 on the hilbert space @xmath2 , then we want to find the best estimation of the states in the orbit @xmath3 obtained by transforming the input state with the unitary representation @xmath4 of the group @xmath5 . in general , the points of the orbit are not in one - to - one correspondence with the elements of the group , since one can have @xmath6 even for different @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , in this paper we will consider for simplicity the case where the correspondence between the group and the orbit is one - to - one , since , a part from a technical complication in the notation , the extension of the results to the general case is straightforward .    in the case of one - to - one correspondence between signal states and elements of the group ,",
    "the problem of state estimation becomes equivalent to estimating the action of a black - box that performs an unknown unitary transformation drawn from the set @xmath9 . from this point of view",
    "it is also important to find the optimal input states that allow to discriminate the action of the unitary operators @xmath4 in the best possible way .",
    "whatever point of view we choose , we always need to estimate the value of a group parameter . in order to do this , the most general estimation strategy allowed by quantum mechanics",
    "is described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath10 , that associates to any estimated parameter @xmath11 a positive semidefinite operator @xmath12 on @xmath2 , satisfying the normalization condition @xmath13 @xmath14 being the normalized invariant haar measure on the group ( @xmath15   @xmath16  @xmath17 ) .",
    "the probability density of estimating @xmath18 when the true value of the parameter is @xmath19 is then given by the usual born rule : @xmath20~,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 .",
    "note that here we are considering @xmath5 as a continuous group only for fixing notation , nevertheless  here and all throughout the paper@xmath5 can have a finite number of elements , say @xmath22 , and in this case we have simply to replace integrals with sums and @xmath23 with @xmath24 .    in order to find an optimal estimation strategy , we need firstly to fix our optimality criterion .",
    "the most common way to do this is to weigh the estimation errors with some cost function@xcite @xmath25 , that assesses the cost of estimating @xmath26 when the true value is @xmath19 .",
    "once the cost function is fixed , we can adopt two different settings for the optimization , the bayesian and the frequentistic one . in the bayesian setting",
    ", one assumes a prior distribution of the true values ( which is usually uniform ) and then the optimal estimation is the one that minimizes the average cost , where the average is performed with respect to the probability distributions of both the estimated and the true values . on the other hand , in the frequentistic setting no prior distribution of the true values is assumed , and one performs a _ minimax _",
    "optimization , i.  e. minimizing the maximum ( over all possible true values ) of the average cost , where now the average is done just over the estimated values .",
    "many different criteria can be used to define what is an optimal estimation , each of them corresponding to a different choice of the cost function in the optimization procedure . in general , the choice of a cost function depends on the particular problem at hand . for example , if we need to estimate a state , a natural cost is the opposite of the fidelity between the estimated state and the true one , while , if we are interested in the estimation of a parameter , a more appropriate cost function would be the variance of the estimated values .    in this paper ,",
    "however , since we want to investigate general properties of covariant estimation , we seek a criterion that maintains a clear meaning in the largest number of different situations .",
    "the simplest approach that allows a general analytical solution is given by the _",
    "_ maximum likelihood criterion__@xcite , which corresponds to the maximization of the probability ( probability density in the continuous case ) that the estimated value of the unknown parameter actually coincides with its true value . in this case , the cost function is a dirac - delta @xmath27 ( kronecker - delta in the finite case ) .    for finite groups maximum likelihood",
    "is in some sense the most natural criterion .",
    "in fact , if we are trying to decide among a finite set of alternatives which is the true one , of course we would like to do this with the maximum probability of success .",
    "on the other hand , in the continuous case , the maximum likelihood approach can still be interpreted as the maximization of the probability that the estimated value lies in a narrow neighborhood of the true one .      here",
    "we will recall some useful tools from group theory that we will exploit throughout the paper .",

    "we will consider two identical copies of an unknown coherent state , while in the second ( conjugated coherent states ) we will consider two coherent states with the same displacement in position and opposite displacement in momentum .",
    "exploiting the method of maximum likelihood we will find in both cases the optimal povm for the estimation of the unknown displacement . from the comparison between the sensitivities of the optimal measurements in the two cases ,",
    "a close analogy will emerge with the well known example by gisin and popescu about quantum information carried by parallel and anti - parallel spins@xcite .",
    "this analogy , already noticed in the study of the optimal `` phase conjugation map '' by cerf and iblisdir@xcite , will be analyzed here in detail from the general point of view of group parameter estimation .",
    "here we consider two harmonic oscillators prepared in the same unknown coherent state @xmath192 , @xmath193 . in this case , the family of signal states is @xmath194 and is obtained from the ground state @xmath195 . by the action of the two - fold tensor representation @xmath196 .",
    "the clebsch - gordan decomposition of such a representation can be easily obtained by using the relation @xmath197 where @xmath198}$ ] ( @xmath199 and @xmath200 denoting annihilation operators for the first and the second oscillator respectively ) .",
    "this relation shows that  modulo a non - local change of basis in the hilbert space  the two - fold tensor representation is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum where the irreducible representation @xmath201 appears with infinite multiplicity .",
    "such a representation is square - summable , and has the formal dimension @xmath202 given by eq .",
    "( [ formdim ] ) .",
    "moreover , according to eq .",
    "( [ directsum ] ) , a possible decomposition of the tensor product hilbert space into irreducible subspaces is given by any set of the form @xmath203 where @xmath204 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath2 . by taking the basis of eigenvectors of the number operator @xmath205 , we immediately see that the input state @xmath195 completely lies in the irreducible subspace @xmath206 .",
    "denoting by @xmath207 the projection onto @xmath208 , we have indeed @xmath209 . using theorem [ theooptpovm ]",
    ", we have that for the state @xmath62 the optimal - likelihood covariant povm must have @xmath69 such that @xmath210 with @xmath211 , since here @xmath128 ( see eq .",
    "( [ schmidt ] ) ) .",
    "then , we have that any covariant povm with @xmath212 is optimal for estimation of @xmath213 . for example , we can take the povm @xmath214 where the unitary @xmath215 is defined as above , and @xmath216 is the vector @xmath217 .",
    "it can be shown that this povm corresponds to measuring the two commuting observables corresponding to the position of the first oscillator and the momentum of the second one . in this scheme ,",
    "if the outcomes of the two measurements are @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively , we simply declare that our estimate of the displacement is @xmath220 .    a different povm which is equally optimal is @xmath221 in a quantum optical setup , this povm corresponds to performing firstly an heterodyne measurement on each oscillator , thus obtaining two different estimates @xmath222 and @xmath223 for the displacement , and then averaging them with equal weights .",
    "the final estimate is @xmath224 .",
    "although the two povm s are different and correspond to two different experimental setups , they give rise to the same probability distribution when applied to coherent states .",
    "it is indeed straightforward to see that the probability density of estimating @xmath225 when the true displacement is @xmath213 is given in both cases by the gaussian @xmath226 ( normalized with respect to the invariant measure @xmath227 ) .",
    "the value of the likelihood is @xmath228 , according to our general formula ( [ optlik ] ) .",
    "_ improving the likelihood with squeezing .",
    "_ + the maximum likelihood can be improved using the doubly - squeezed state @xmath229 where without loss of generality we choose @xmath230 ( @xmath231 for normalization ) .",
    "then , by applying theorem [ theooptpovm ] , it is immediate to show that @xmath232 and to evaluate the likelihood of the optimal povm as @xmath233 notice that for zero squeezing ( @xmath234 ) we retrieve the case of two identical coherent states , while for infinite squeezing ( @xmath235 ) the likelihood becomes infinite , according to the fact that the displaces states @xmath236 become orthogonal in the dirac sense , allowing for an ideal estimation .",
    "now the family of signal states is @xmath237 where complex conjugation is defined with respect to the basis @xmath238 .",
    "these states are generated from the input state @xmath195 by the action of the representation @xmath239 .",
    "unfortunately , such a representation can not be decomposed into a discrete clebsch - gordan series , due to the fact that all the unitaries in the representation can be simultaneously diagonalized on a continuous set of non normalizable eigenvectors .",
    "in fact , for any vector of the form @xmath240 , where @xmath216 is the vector @xmath241 , we have @xmath242 these vectors are",
    "orthogonal in the dirac sense , namely @xmath243 .",
    "therefore , any such vector can be regarded the basis of a one - dimensional irreducible subspace @xmath244 .",
    "the multiplicity of any irreducible representation is one , and the hilbert space can be decomposed as a direct integral @xmath245 in the same way as in ( [ commutingop ] ) , an operator @xmath246 in the commutant of the representation can be written as @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the identity in @xmath244 , and @xmath249 is some scalar function .    in this particular example",
    "it is easy to extend the results of sections [ optmeasurements ] and [ optinputstates ] to the case of a direct integral of irreducible representations .",
    "in fact , using functional calculus we can generalize the formula ( [ aveop ] ) for the group average :    the average @xmath250 of an operator over the representation @xmath251 is @xmath252~,\\ ] ] where @xmath253= \\<\\!\\ < d(\\beta)|~a~|d(\\beta)\\>\\!\\>$ ] .",
    "this expression for the group average is equivalent to that of eq.([aveop ] ) modulo the obvious substitutions : @xmath254 the optimal povm is obtained by theorem [ theooptpovm ] by making these substitutions .",
    "we just need to decompose the input state on the irreducible subspaces , i.e. @xmath255 and then take the optimal povm given by the operator @xmath256 in eqs .",
    "( [ optxi ] ) and ( [ opteta ] ) , which in the present case becomes @xmath257 notice that , since the input state @xmath258 has nonzero components in all the irreducible subspaces , the optimal covariant povm is now unique . using such optimal povm ,",
    "@xmath259 the probability density of estimating @xmath225 when the true displacement is @xmath213 can be calculated to be the gaussian @xmath260 ( normalized with respect to the invariant measure @xmath190 ) .    notice that the value of the likelihood @xmath261 could also be calculated directly using the formula ( [ optlik ] ) , which now reads @xmath262 comparing the optimal distribution ( [ gauss2 ] ) for two conjugated coherent states with the corresponding one for two identical coherent states ( [ gauss1 ] ) we can observe that the variance has been reduced by one half , while the likelihood has become twice .",
    "it is interesting to note the remarkable analogy between this example in continuous variables and the example by gisin and popescu @xcite about the quantum information encoded into a pair of parallel and anti - parallel spins . in fact , in the case of spins the authors stressed that , quite counter - intuitively , while two classical arrows pointing in opposite direction carry the same information , in a quantum mechanical setup two anti - parallel spins carry more information than two parallel ones . in the same way , in the continuous variables context , while classically two conjugated points @xmath213 and @xmath263 in the phase space carry the same information ( such information being the couple of real numbers @xmath264  ) , quantum mechanically two conjugated coherent states carry more information than two identical ones .",
    "the analogy is even closer , since for spin-@xmath265 particles the `` spin - flip '' operation is unitarily equivalent to the complex conjugation , whence we can regard also the example of spins as a comparison between pairs of identical states and pairs of conjugated states .",
    "it is important to stress that the group theoretical analysis and the maximum likelihood approach provide in both cases also a clear explanation of the mechanism generating the asymmetry between pairs of identical and conjugated states .",
    "in fact , the whole orbit of a pair of identical coherent states ( or spins states ) lies just in _ one _ irreducible subspace of the hilbert space , while the orbit of a pair of conjugated coherent states ( spin states ) covers _ all _ irreducible subspaces . according to formula ( [ optlik ] ) , the likelihood in the case of conjugated states is higher than the likelihood for identical states both in the case of coherent and spin states , corresponding to an enhancement of the probability of successful discrimination .",
