    "recently , a new particle of mass about 125 gev has been discovered at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) with a total production rate consistent with that of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  @xcite . confirming this higgs - like particle as the one responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking is of paramount importance in particle physics because , for one thing , it explains the origin of mass for elementary particles . while further detailed examinations are required",
    ", the current lhc data show some deviations in the pattern of its decay branching ratios from the sm expectation .",
    "this leads to the speculation that the higgs sector may not as simple as the one in sm .    in certain new physics models such as supersymmetry",
    ", the higgs sector has to be extended with additional nontrivial isospin @xmath8 scalar multiplets for consistency or to explain new phenomena .",
    "such an extension also holds the capacity to provide additional cp - violating sources for low - energy phenomena as well as baryon asymmetry of the universe . for example , the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite is an extensively studied prototype in which an additional scalar doublet is introduced .",
    "@xmath8 triplet higgs fields also occur in some new physics models , such as the left - right symmetric model  @xcite and little higgs models  @xcite . by introducing a complex triplet higgs field",
    ", it is possible to have an effective dimension-5 operator for generating tiny majorana mass for neutrinos .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine the true higgs sector in order to exactly know what kind of new physics models exist at the tev or higher energy scales . in this paper , we want to focus on the phenomenology of the extended higgs sector in the model proposed by georgi and machacek ( gm ) @xcite in mid-80s .",
    "we investigate how one can distinguish it from the other higgs - extended models at the lhc .",
    "the gm model contains a higgs doublet field @xmath9 and a triplet field @xmath10 , with the latter containing a hypercharge @xmath11 component and a @xmath12 component .",
    "the model is of great interest because it can provide tiny mass to neutrinos  la the seesaw mechanism , dubbed the type - ii seesaw  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the higgs potential in this model can be constructed to maintain a custodial @xmath4 symmetry at the tree level @xcite , keeping the electroweak @xmath0 parameter at unity to be consistent with the experimental constraint . in the model , there are 5-plet higgs bosons @xmath1 ( = @xmath13 ) , 3-plet higgs bosons @xmath2 ( = @xmath14 ) and singlet higgs boson @xmath15 under the classification of the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the masses of the higgs bosons belonging to the same @xmath4 multiplet are the same at the tree level as the consequence of custodial symmetry .",
    "the doubly - charged higgs boson @xmath16 , for example , is an important but not unique feature of the model .",
    "finding particles in one higgs multiplet and checking their ( near ) mass degeneracy would better verify the model .",
    "strategies of discovering such higgs bosons , however , depend largely on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs triplet field , @xmath17 .    in the minimal higgs triplet model ( htm ) where only one additional complex higgs triplet is introduced , the doubly - charged higgs bosons couples dominantly to a pair of like - sign leptons when @xmath18 gev .",
    "the collider phenomenology of this scenario has been extensively studied recently @xcite .",
    "the doubly - charged higgs boson has been searched for at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite by looking for like - sign lepton pairs with the same or different flavors .",
    "a lower mass bound of about @xmath19 gev has been obtained for most scenarios . on the other hand , the doubly - charged higgs bosons couples dominantly to a pair of like - sign @xmath20 bosons when @xmath21 gev .",
    "this possibility is less explored experimentally . besides , the triplet vev in the htm is constrained by the @xmath0 parameter to be less than a few gev , limiting significantly the discovery reach at the lhc .    in the gm model , a larger triplet vev is allowed due to the custodial symmetry .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider signatures of the like - sign gauge boson decays . in ref .",
    "@xcite , collider phenomenology of the gm model has been discussed in the case of light triplet - like higgs bosons , _",
    "e.g. _ , less than 100 gev .",
    "a recent study by one of the authors and collaborators @xcite finds that with @xmath22 gev and appropriate cuts , the current lhc can reach up to @xmath23 gev for the doubly - charged higgs mass . in this work ,",
    "we further explore consequences of the custodial symmetry in the higgs sector of the gm model and study the phenomenology of its entire higgs sector at the lhc .",
    "we find that the single production of @xmath1 via the weak vector boson fusion process is useful to test the mass degeneracy among the @xmath1 bosons .",
    "we also find that the drell - yan process , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are simultaneously produced can be used to check the mass degeneracy among @xmath2 .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the gm model in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the higgs bosons are first classified according to their group representations under the custodial symmetry .",
    "we then consider possible mixings between the two triplets and between the two singlets , and work out their masses . a mass relation among the higgs bosons of different representations",
    "is obtained in the decoupling limit when the triplet vev vanishes .",
    "finally , we show the yukawa couplings between sm fermions and the physical higgs bosons . in section  [ sec : constraints ] , we consider both theoretical constraints of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability and the experimental constraint from the @xmath24-pole data of @xmath25 decay at one - loop level . in particular , they impose bounds on the triplet vev and the higgs triplet mass",
    ". in section  [ sec : decays ] , we discuss in detail how the higgs bosons decay in scenarios with or without hierarchy in the masses of the physical higgs singlet , 3-plet , and 5-plet .",
