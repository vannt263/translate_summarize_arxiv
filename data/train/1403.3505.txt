    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have exceptional strength and stability , and they can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting properties depending on the rolling direction ( chirality ) and diameter [ ] . due to these structural and electronic properties ,",
    "many studies have expected the applications of cnts in future nanoelectronic devices [ ] .",
    "attention has focused especially on field - effect transistors ( fets ) . with the continuous improvement of scaling and contacts , high performances of carbon nanotube field - effect transistors ( cnfets )",
    "have been reported [ ] .",
    "cnfet has a significant potential to replace conventional silicon - based circuitry due to its smaller size , better electrostatics , and higher mobility . and",
    "nanoelectronic devices will promisingly be used in future space technology and weapons technology .",
    "the space radiation and nuclear radiation are known to cause defects in solids [ ] .",
    "and the fabrication process of cnfets introduces also defects in the oxide or at the nanotube - oxide interface [ ] .",
    "a defect in gate oxide may trap a current carrier on a carbon nanotube and then detrap it .",
    "a charge state of the defect may keep for some time and then change into another charge state due to the random trapping or detrapping .",
    "such random charge - state switching will cause a random current switching between two ( or more ) levels , i.e. , random telegraph signals ( rtss ) [ ] .",
    "rtss due to individual defects in cnfets have been observed in experiments [ ] , and giant rts values of 60% or more have recently been detected [ ] . some experiments [ ] measured rtss even at low drain bias of 50 mv due to defects at the nanotube - oxide interface or in the oxide .",
    "theoretical studies have also indicated that a single defect in the gate dielectric of a cnfet may cause a substantial current change in cnfets [ ] . when there are many defects with different time constants , the superposition of rts leads to a low frequency 1/f noise [ ] .",
    "therefore , cnfets need not only to be provided with the resistance to radiations but also to be designed with low noise . clearly , studying the effect of individual defects is important for understanding the microscopic aspect of 1/f noise in cnfets as well as for designing a cnfet with low noise .",
    "sio@xmath1 is a commonly used gate dielectric for the conventional metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) and cnfets . to improve continuously the performances of the fets , the thickness limit of sio@xmath1",
    "will soon be reached and a new dielectric material with a high dielectric constant is needed to replace sio@xmath1 .",
    "the fet gate stack scaling with various materials of high dielectric constant have widely been studied [ ] .",
    "usually , the band gap decreases as the dielectric constant increases . simply employing thinner hfo@xmath1 ( @xmath2 16 ) or other materials with high dielectric constant is not a solution because the thinner hfo@xmath1 or other materials of high dielectric constant will cause unacceptably high levels of gate leakage current [ ] .",
    "tio@xmath1 has a large dielectric constant that ranges from 40 to 86 [ ] and its band gap is between 3.0 @xmath3 3.5 ev [ ] , depending on the crystalline structure .",
    "a considerable gate leakage current occurs if tio@xmath1-only gate dielectric is used due to small band gap and thermionic emission .",
    "sio@xmath1 has a band gap of 9 ev , which is much larger than the band gap of tio@xmath1 .",
    "it has been known that composite gate oxides with tio@xmath1 and sio@xmath1 can reduce effectively the gate leakage current within a range of appropriate gate voltages [ ] . recently",
    ", composite gate dielectrics have been studied to reduce gate leakage current [ ] .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "[ ] , using a sigle gate oxide with large dielectric constant or small thickness can reduce the rts noise amplitude",
    ". however , for a compiste structure of gate insulators how the rts noise amplitude depends on dielectric constants and thicknesses of inner and outer insulators is unknown up to now . in this work",
    ", we will investigate systematically how the composite gate dielectrics affect the amplitude of the rts noise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_2 ]",
    "we show the device setup for simulations and give a brief overview of our methodology . in section [ sec_3 ]",
    "we present our calculation results for the dependence of the rts noise amplitude on the nanotube radius and parameters of composite gate dielectrics , and discuss also how to reduce the amplitude of the noise caused by a charge in composite gate dielectrics .",
    "finally , conclusions will be given in section [ sec_4 ] .",
    "the insets of fig.[current - exp ] show the cylindrical geometry of a cnfet considered for calculations , which is similar to the device used in refs . [ ] . in the present work , we consider a zigzag ( n,0 ) semi - conducting carbon nanotube , where the index n will be defined in the calculation .",
    "source and drain leads are separated from the cnt in the radial direction by a van der waals distance of 0.3 nm .",
    "the cnt is surrounded by a dielectric oxide , whose dielectric constant and thickness will be defined according to the request of calculations .",
    "the cnt is divided into three regions : semi - infinite source and drain regions having uniform potentials , and a self - consistent scattering region .",
    "the scattering lengths of the cnt inside the source and drain leads are both defined as 24 nm .",
    "the channel length between the source and drain leads is 200 nm unless otherwise specified .",
    "the thickness of the gate oxide will be defined below .",
    "the work function of the metal source and drain leads is chosen to be 1 ev larger than the work function of the cnt , which is measured from midgap .",
    "this gives an ohmic p - type contact , as obtained in recent experiments [ ] .",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath4 .    at an appropriate gate voltage ,",
    "if a drain bias is applied a source - drain current will occur .",
    "the drain voltage is related to the fermi levels of the source and drain leads by the expression of @xmath5 . the electron ( or hole ) transport properties can be calculated using the non - equilibrium greens function method .",
    "the retarded greens function of the scattering region plays an important role in the theory .",
    "it can be expressed as [ ] @xmath6g^{r}(e)\\ = \\ i , \\label{green - function}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the identity matrix , @xmath8 is the hamiltonian for the scattering region of the cnt , and @xmath9 denote retarded self - energies of the source and drain leads , respectively .",
    "we describe the hamiltonian of a cnt using a tight - binding approximation with one @xmath10 orbital per carbon atom [ ] . the nonequilibrium greens function can easily be calculated using a mode - based method in ref .",
    "the charge distribution in the scattering region can be evaluated using the density matrix [ ] .",
    "then , the discrete charges on the cnt are broadened by a gaussian along the nanotube direction and in the radial direction with @xmath110.07 nm , which is about half the c - c bond length [ ] .",
    "the charge of the defect is approximately treated as a point charge , smeared by a gaussian along the nanotube axis and in the radial direction with @xmath110.05 nm [ ] , and is placed midway between the source and drain leads .",
    "scattering from the coulomb potential of the charged defect is treated neglecting band mixing .",
    "the potential along a cnt can be obtained from the solution of the poisson equation at a finite drain voltage [ ] .",
    "it is found from eq.([green - function ] ) that the greens function @xmath12 will be changed due to the potential , which is included in the hamiltonian @xmath8 of the cnt .",
    "therefore , the greens function of the scattering region @xmath12 , the charge on the cnt , and the potential along the cnt must be determined self - consistently .",
    "if the greens function @xmath12 is obtained from self - consistent calculations , one can calculate the current through the system using the well - known landauer - bttiker formula [ ] @xmath13\\ , \\label{current}\\ ] ] where the factor of 2 is due to the degeneracy of spin and @xmath14 is the fermi function .",
    "the transmission between the source and drain leads in eq.([current ] ) can be determined using the following expression [ ] @xmath15 where @xmath16 is defined by the formula of @xmath17 $ ] .    for a p - type cnfet",
    ", the hole emission and capture by a defect in the gate oxide will cause randomly the current switchings between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e. rtss .",
    "the amplitude of such rts noise is defined as the relative current change due to the charge of the defect [ ] @xmath20 where @xmath19 and @xmath18 are the current with and without the charge .",
    "in this section , we investigate in detail how the amplitude of the rts noise due to a single defect depends on the nanotube radius and how the rts noise amplitude relys on the parameters of composite gate dielectrics , such as , thicknesses and dielectric constants of the inner insulator and the outer insulator .",
    "the nanotube - direction position of the charge is fixed in the middle of the channel .      to demonstrate the validity of our model",
    ", we calculate the current through a cnfet of sylindrical geometry with a zigzag ( 14,0 ) carbon nanotube and a 10 nm - thick hfo@xmath1 dielectric . the channel length in the calculation",
    "is defined as 40 nm . the obtained result for @xmath23",
    "v is shown in fig.[current - exp ] . a recent experiment [ ] measured the current at @xmath23 v through a cnfet with a cylindrical geometry of gate electrode . in the experiment ,",
    "the carbon nanotube was 1 nm in diameter and 40 nm in length , and the gate oxide was 10 nm - thick hfo@xmath1 .",
    "the experimental result is also displayed in fig.[current - exp ] for comparison .",
    "clearly , our calculation results are in quite good agreement with experimental data [ ] .",
    "the good agreement between theoretical results and experimental data justifies our model .",
    "we consider a commonly used insulator of sio@xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) as a gate oxide of a cnfet and investigate the dependence of @xmath21 on the nanotube radius . for different",
    "zigzag ( n,0 ) carbon nanotubes , where the index n is 13 , 17 , 20 , 25 , and 29 , we calculate the current through the device at the drain voltage of -50 mv and at different gate voltages from -3 v to 0.5 v. for the gate radius of @xmath25 nm , the obtained result is shown in panel ( a ) of fig.[diff_nanotube ] as a function of the applied gate voltage .",
    "the ( 13,0 ) zigzag nanotube gives the large value of on - off current ratio , @xmath26 , while the ( 29,0 ) zigzag nanotube gives a much lower on - off current ratio , @xmath27 .    for a positive charge of q",
    "= + 1e located at a radial distance of 0.4 nm from the nanotube wall ( i.e. , at the nanotube - oxide interface ) , we calculate the amplitude of the rts noise due to the positive charge for a gate radius of @xmath28 nm , a dielectric constant of 3.9 , and zigzag ( n,0 ) carbon nanotubes with the index n being 13 , 17 , 20 , 25 , and 29 . from the calculated current through a cnfet with and without charged defect in the device , we calculate the amplitude of the rts noise due to the charged defect .",
    "the obtained results are shown as a function of gate voltage @xmath29 in fig.[diff_nanotube ] .",
    "it is clear that the smaller the nanotube is , the bigger the amplitude of the rts noise is .    in order to understand the dependence of the rts noise amplitude on the nanotube radius , we calculate the potential along the nanotube and",
    "show the result in fig.[poten - trans](a ) . in the absence of any scatterer ,",
    "the potential in the channel is almost constant in midchannel , as expected for a long - channel ballistic device .",
    "a positively charged trap right at the nanotube - oxide interface causes an extra barrier for hole transport , giving a shift in the plot of transmission vs energy in fig.[poten - trans](b ) .",
    "this shifts the voltage threshold of the device , as seen in fig.[diff_nanotube ] .",
    "comparing the potential for the ( 13,0 ) nanotube and the potential for the ( 29,0 ) nanotube , concerning the hole transmission the potential barrier of the former is much larger than that of the latter .",
    "this gives a less abrupt turn - on of transmission with energy for the ( 13,0 ) nanotube as shown in fig.[poten - trans](b ) .",
    "therefore , we expect a larger amplitude of the rts noise for the ( 13,0 ) nanotube .    from the above calculations of current through idea cnfets ( i.e. , without any charged defect ) for different carbon nanotube radii , one can see that a smaller semi - conducting nanotube gives a larger value of on - off current ratio @xmath30 . however , the rts noise amplitude for a smaller semi - conducting nanotube is larger , which suggests one to make an intermediate choice between different nanotube radii . in the following ,",
    "we use a zigzag ( 17,0 ) carbon nanotube , which has a radius of 0.67 nm , to study the rts noise in fets .",
    "the amplitude of the rts noise is known to decrease with the gate dielectric thickness . however",
    ", if the gate dielectric is too thin the gate leakage current will occur because of direct tunneling between the bands of the semi - conducting nanotube and the fermi level of the gate electrode .",
    "composite gate insulators may be used to prevent or reduce the gate leakage current [ ] .",
    "the question then arises : how does the amplitude of the rts noise due to a charged defect depend on the parameters of the composite gate insulators ? to answer this question",
    ", we will investigate the current reduction due to a charged defect in a composite gate insulators as shown in fig.[device_setup_2 ] . for convenience ,",
    "we denote the thickness and dielectric constant of the inner insulator as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",

    "the relative current reduction in the turn - on region is around 80% , which is decreased by about 11% as compared with the corresponding result for @xmath39 nm obtained before .",
    "the comparison of panels ( b ) and ( d ) of fig.[current_cgi_eps16 ] represents that the relative current reduction due to a charge in composite gate dielectrics increases with the decreasing total thickness of composite gate dielectrics if the outer insulator is unchanged . for comparison sake",
    ", the results of relative current reduction for 3 nm - thick sio@xmath1 and 3 nm - thick hfo@xmath1 are shown in panel ( b ) of fig.[current_cgi_eps16 ] , and the corresponding results for 15 nm - thick sio@xmath1 and 15 nm - thick hfo@xmath1 are shown in panel ( d ) of fig.[current_cgi_eps16 ] .",
    "as expected , the relative current reduction due to a charge in single gate dielectric of sio@xmath1 or hfo@xmath1 decreases if the gate dielectric gets thinner .",
    "apparently , the dependence of the relative current reduction due to a charge in composite gate dielectrics on the thickness of the composite gate dielectrics is contradictory to the dependence of the relative current reduction caused by a charge in a single gate dielectric on the thickness of the single gate dielectric .    to see more clearly",
    ", we consider another example of composite gate dielectrics , which is a combination of the inner insulator with @xmath40 nm and the outer insulator of 2 nm - thick sio@xmath1 ( namely @xmath41 nm ) .",

    "the screening of the impurity charge contains the screening by the composite gate insulators and the screening by the gate electrode . from the top panel of fig.[poten - trans_1 ] , it is found that the total screening effect of the impurity charge in the composite gate insulators decreases if the full thickness of the composite gate dielectrics becomes smaller and the thickness of the outer insulator maintains unchanged .",
    "the screening of the impurity charge by the gate electrode increases with the decreasing thickness of the composite gate dielectrics because the screening by the gate electrode becomes stronger when the gate electrode is closer to the impurity charge [ ] .",

    "one may use eq.([eff_dielec ] ) to explain qualitatively the dependence of the effective dielectric constant of composite gate insulators ( as shown in fig.[device_setup_2 ] ) on the thickness of the inner insulator @xmath31 .",
    "it is clear from eq.([eff_dielec ] ) that if @xmath50 , @xmath31 increases and @xmath33 keeps unchanged , the effective dielectric constant of the composite insulators increases .",
    "so , the screening of the impurity charge by the composite insulators increases if the full thickness of the composite insulators gets larger and the outer insulator maintains the same thickness . on the contrary ,",
    "the screening of the impurity charge by the gate electrode decreases with the increasing thickness of the composite insulators . from results shown in the top panel of fig.[poten - trans_1 ] , we conclude that the screening of the impurity charge by the composite insulators increases with the full thickness of the composite insulators faster than the screening of the impurity charge by the gate electrode decreases with the increasing full thickness of the composite insulators , so that the summing - up screening effect of the impurity charge increases with the full thickness of the composite insulators if the thickness of the outer insulator is kept the same .",
    "since the screening of the impurity charge in the composite insulators is sophisticatedly dependent on the thickness of the inner insulator @xmath31 and the thickness of the outer insulator @xmath33 , we investigate how the relative current reduction depends on the thickness of the inner insulator @xmath31 within a wide range of @xmath31 when the thickness of the outer insulator is fixed .",

    "furthermore , from the top panel of fig.[rts_cgi ] we can see that the relative current reduction for a single gate insulator increases nearly to its saturation value if the thickness of the gate oxide @xmath64 nm , and this indicates that the screening of the impurity charge by the gate electrode becomes very weak if the thickness of the gate oxide is large enough .",

    "such amplitudes of the rts noise in the turn - on region are much smaller than the corresponding rts noise amplitude for the sio@xmath1-only gate oxide .",
    "in this work , we calculate current through a ballistic p - type carbon nanotube transistor , using the nonequilibrium green function method in a tight - binding approximation .",
    "the obtained current for an idea cnfet ( i.e. , without any charged defect ) is in good agreement with experimental result [ ] . from the calculated current through a cnfet with and without charged defect in the device , we evaluate the amplitude of the random - telegraph - signal noise due to the defect . we have investigated the dependence of the rts noise amplitude due to a single postive charge on the nanotube radius .",

    "we consider as gate dielectrics a composite structure of an inner insulator with a large dielectric constant and an outer insulator with a dielectric constant of 3.9 ( as for sio@xmath1 ) as shown in fig[device_setup_2 ] .",
    "we have studied the relative current reduction due to a charged impurity in the composite gate insulators .",
    "the screening of the impurity charge includes the screening of the impurity charge by the gate electrode and the screening of the impurity charge by the composite gate insulators .",
    "the screening effect of the impurity charge by the gate electrode increases with the decreasing full thickness of the composite gate insulators . on the contrary",
    ", the screening of the impurity charge by the composite gate insulators diminishes if the full thickness of the composite gate insulators gets smaller and the thickness of the outer insulator remains the same .",
    "this is because when the thickness of the outer insulator is fixed the effective constant constant of the composite gate insulators diminishes with the decreasing thickness of the inner insulator .",
    "since the former screening effect varies with the full thickness of the composite gate insulators slower than the latter screening effect , the summing - up screening effects of the impurity charge weakens with the decreasing full thickness of the composite gate dielectrics if the thickness of the outer dielectric remains unaltered .",
    "the relative current reduction due to the impurity charge in a p - type cnfet increases with the decreasing ratio of the inner - insulator thickness to the outer - insulator thickness .",
    "if the inner insulator is very thin , even though its dielectric constant is as large as 80 , the amplitude of the rts noise caused by the charge of q = + 1e may amount to around 80% in the turn - on region .",
    "if the thickness of the inner gate insulator is much larger than the thickness of the outer gate insulator , the rts noise caused by the charge of q = + 1e in the composite gate insulators of a p - type cnfet may be reduced greatly .",
    "if we use a combination of the inner insulator with a dielectric constant of 80 and the outer insulator with a dielectric constant of 3.9 ( as for sio@xmath1 ) and the inner insulator is much thicker than the outer insultor , the rts noise amplitude due to a charge of q = + 1e may be reduced to no more than 30% in the turn - on region and 0.1% in the on - state .",
    "since a single defect in the gate oxide of a cnfet may cause a large amplitude of rts noise , it is important to establish the effective methods to resist radiations ; on the other hand , cnfets may also be used for detecting radiations .",
