    "chronometry is the science of the measurement of time .",
    "as the time flow of clocks depends on the surrounding gravity field through the relativistic gravitational redshift predicted by einstein @xcite , chronometric geodesy considers the use of clocks to directly determine earth s gravitational potential differences .",
    "instead of using state - of - the - art earth s gravitational field models to predict frequency shifts between distant clocks  ( @xcite , itoc project ) , the principle is to reverse the problem and ask ourselves whether the of frequency shifts between distant clocks can improve our knowledge of earth s gravity and geoid @xcite .",
    "for example , two clocks with an accuracy of  @xmath1 in terms of relative frequency shift would detect a 1-cm geoid height variation between them , corresponding to a geopotential variation  @xmath2 of about  @xmath3  ( for more details , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "until recently , the performances of optical clocks had not been sufficient for the determination of earth s gravity potential . in 2010",
    ", @xcite demonstrated the ability of the new generation of atomic clocks , based on optical transitions , to sense geoid height differences with a 30-cm level of accuracy . to date , the best of these instruments reach a stability of  @xmath4 ( nist , riken + univ .",
    "tokyo , @xcite ) after 7 hours of integration time .",
    "more recently , an accuracy of  @xmath5 ( jila , @xcite ) has been obtained , equivalent to geopotential differences of 0.2  , or 2  cm on the geoid . .",
    "such results the question of what can we learn about earth s gravity and mass sources using clocks , that we can not easily derive from existing gravimetric data .",
    "recent studies address this question ; for example , @xcite discuss the value and future applicability of chronometric geodesy for direct geoid mapping on continents and joint gravity potential surveying to determine subsurface density anomalies .",
    "they find that a geoid perturbation caused by a 1.5  km radius sphere with 20 per cent density anomaly buried at 2  km depth in the earth s crust is already detectable by atomic clocks with present - day accuracy .",
    "they also investigate other applications , for earthquake prediction and volcanic eruptions @xcite , or to monitor vertical surface motion changes due to magmatic , post - seismic , or tidal deformations @xcite .    here",
    "we will consider the `` static '' or `` long - term '' component of earth s gravity .",
    "our knowledge of earth s gravitational field is usually expressed through geopotential grids and models that integrate all available observations , globally or over an area of interest .",
    "these models are , however , not based on direct observations with the potential itself , which has to be reconstructed or extrapolated by integrating measurements of its derivatives .",
    "the potential is reconstructed with a centimetric accuracy at resolutions of the order of 100 km from grace and goce satellite data @xcite , and integrated from near - surface gravimetry for the shorter spatial scales . as a result ,",
    "the standard deviation ( rms ) of differences between geoid heights obtained from a global high - resolution model as egm2008 , and from a combination of gps / leveling data , reaches up to 10  cm in areas well covered in surface data @xcite .",
    "the uneven distribution of surface gravity data , especially in transitional zones ( coasts , borders between different countries ) and with important gaps in areas difficult to access , indeed limits the accuracy of the reconstruction when aiming at a centimetric level of precision .",
    "this is an important issue , as large gravity and geoid variations over a range of spatial scales are found in mountainous regions , and because a high accuracy on altitudes determination is crucial in coastal zones .",
    "airborne gravity surveys are thus realized in such regions @xcite ; local clock - based geopotential determination could be another way to overcome these limitations .    in this context , here",
    ", we investigate to what extent clocks could contribute to fill the gap between the satellite and near - surface gravity spectral and spatial coverages in order to improve our knowledge of the geopotential and gravity field at all wavelengths . by nature , potential data are smoother and more sensitive to mass sources at than gravity data , which are strongly influenced by local effects .",
    "thus , they could naturally complement existing networks in sparsely covered places and even also contribute to point out possible systematic patterns of errors in the less recent gravity datasets .",
    "we address the question through test case examples of high - resolution geopotential reconstructions in areas with different characteristics , leading to different variabilities of the gravity field .",
    "we consider the massif central in france , marked by smooth , moderate altitude mountains and volcanic plateaus , and an alps - mediterranean zone , comprising high reliefs and a land / sea transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we briefly summarize the method schematically . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we describe the regions of interest and the construction of the high - resolution synthetic datasets used in our tests . in section  [ sec:4 ] , we present the methodology to assess the contribution of new clock data in the potential recovery , in addition to ground gravity measurements .",
    "numerical results are shown in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we finally discuss in section  [ sec:6 ] the influence of different parameters like the data noise level and coverage .",
    "the rapid progress of optical clocks performances opens new perspectives for their use in geodesy and geophysics . while they were",
    "until recently built only as stationary laboratory devices , several transportable optical clocks are currently under construction or test ( see e.g. @xcite . the technological step toward state - of - the art transportable optical clocks is likely to take place within the next decade . in parallel , in order to assess the capabilities of this upcoming technology , we chose an approach based on numerical simulation in order to investigate whether atomic clocks can improve the determination of the geopotential .",

    "this is useful to check for instance the effect of the number of clock measurements on the residuals or to find an optimal coverage for the clock measurements ; 3 .   the potential estimation error , due to the intrinsic imperfection of the chosen for the geopotential . in our case",
    ", this is due to the low - frequency content of the covariance function chosen for the least - square collocation method ( see section  [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "all these sources of errors are somewhat entangled with one another , such that a careful analysis must be done when varying the parameters of the simulation .",
    "this is discussed in details in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "our study focuses on two different areas in france . the first region is the massif central located between n and e , and consists of plateaus and low mountain range , see figure  [ fig : auv ] .",
    "the second target area , much more hilly and mountainous , is the french alps with a portion of the mediterranean sea located at the limit of different countries and bounded by n and e , see figure  [ fig : alpes ] .",
    "topography is obtained from the 30  m digital elevation model over france by ign , completed with @xcite bathymetry and srtm data .",
    "available surface gravity data in these areas , from the bgi ( international gravimetric bureau ) , are shown in figures  [ fig : auv_bgi_dg_val][fig : alpes_bgi_dg_val ] .",
    "note that the bgi gravity data values are not used in this study , but only their spatial distribution in order to generate realistic distribution in the synthetic tests . in these figures",
    ", it is shown that the gravity data are sparsely distributed : the plain is densely surveyed while the mountainous regions are poorly covered because they are mostly inaccessible by the conventional gravity survey .",
    "the range of free - air gravity anomalies  ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which are quite large reflects the complex structure of the gravity field in these regions , which means that the gravitational field strength varies greatly from place to place at high - resolution .",
    "the scarcity of gravity data in the hilly regions is thus a major limitation in deriving accurate high - resolution geopotential model .      here",
    ", we present the way to simulate our synthetic gravity disturbances  @xmath6 and disturbing potentials  @xmath7 by subtracting the gravity field long and short wavelengths influence of a high - resolution global geopotential model .    the generation of the synthetic data  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 at the earth s topographic surface was carried out , in ellipsoidal approximation , with the fortran program geopot @xcite of the national geodetic survey ( ngs ) .",
    "the ellipsoidal normal field is defined by the parameters of the geodetic reference system grs80 @xcite . as input",

    "our objective is to study how clocks can advance knowledge of the geoid beyond the resolution of the satellites . in a first step ,",

    "the gravity field is progressively filtered using 3  poisson wavelets spectra @xcite , while its full content is preserved above degree  583 . in this way we realize a smooth transition between the wavelengths covered by the satellites and those constrained from the surface data .    to subtract the terrain effects included in eigen-6c4 , we used the topographic potential model dv_ell_ret2012 @xcite truncated at d / o  . complete up to d / o",
    ", this model provides in ellipsoidal approximation the gravitational attraction due to the topographic masses anywhere on the earth s surface .",

    "indeed , these data mainly follow the roads and valleys which could be accessible for a clock comparison .",
    "then , we use a simple geometric approach in order to put clock measurements in regions where the gravity data coverage is poor .",
    "since the potential varies smoothly compared to the gravity field , a clock measurement is affected by masses at a larger distance than in the case of a gravimetric measurement .",
