    "<S> we further discuss the stability of susy with respect to generic perturbations , and find that much of the above results remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these results directly apply to the well - established @xmath4 laughlin state , in which case susy is a highly robust property of the edge theory . </S>",
    "<S> these results unveil a hidden topological structure on the long - studied read - rezayi states .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction : _ since its discovery , the quantum hall effect has led to a plethora of remarkable new physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) effect @xcite , for instance , is a paradigmatic example of non - interacting topological phases , characterized by bulk topological invariants and gapless edge modes . </S>",
    "<S> the strongly interacting fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states @xcite , on the other hand , present even more striking properties , such as the existence of fractionally charged anyonic bulk excitations .    </S>",
    "<S> a subset of the fractional states are non - abelian ones , whose bulk excitations are non - abelian anyons , and whose edges realize non - trivial interacting conformal field theories ( cfts ) . while the recent interest in non - abelian phases is mostly driven by their exotic bulk excitations and the possibility of using them as resources in topological quantum computation , these states are also a natural playground for experimentally studying one - dimensional ( 1d ) conformal field theories ( cfts ) .    in this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> we will study the edge cfts of read - rezayi ( rr ) states at filling @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example is given by the @xmath4 laughlin state , corresponding to @xmath6 , which constitute the most prominent fqh state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rr states with @xmath7 , on the other hand , are widely believed to be energetically unfavorable compared to other competing states at the same filling factors in the lowest landau - level . in the first excited landau - level , however , numerical works indicate that the particle - hole conjugates of these states may be the ground - states in the corresponding filling factors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the plateaus observed at @xmath8 and @xmath9 are strong candidates for realizing the particle - hole conjugates of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , supersymmetry ( susy ) - a symmetry transforming bosons to fermions and vice versa - emerges naturally in these states .    in general , susy is a space - time symmetry which constitutes the only possible extension of the poincar group consistent with the symmetries of the scattering - matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has attracted attention given that it solves several open problems in high - energy physics and cosmology @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , its existence implies that the strengths of the three fundamental forces of the standard model unify at the same energy scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if it is in fact a symmetry of nature , it will provide natural candidates for dark matter particles .    despite its many features </S>",
    "<S> , the existence of this symmetry has not been confirmed in high energy experiments so far . </S>",
    "<S> this has recently sparked interest in realizing susy in condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , signatures of space - time susy have been proposed in the spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking transition on the edge of topological systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , it was shown that in this case the critical point belongs to the same universality class as the tricritical ising model , and therefore possesses @xmath12 susy . </S>",
    "<S> the same universality has been discovered in strongly interacting majorana chains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently @xcite , @xmath2 susy was shown to generically exist in translation invariant lattice systems with an odd number of majorana degrees of freedom per unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been suggested that @xmath2 susy appears at the tricritical point between a dirac semi - metal and a pair - density - wave on the surface of a correlated topological insulator @xcite .    in this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that the low - energy description of the edge of rr states gives rise to an @xmath2 susy , generated by two fermionic charges @xmath13 . combining this with the existence of conformal symmetry , we find that the edge of our incompressible state realizes an @xmath2 superconformal theory in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> once we establish the emergence of susy in our quantum hall system , we will turn to study its implications . to do so </S>",
    "<S> , we will introduce the so - called witten index , which is a fundamental topological invariant measuring the number of bosonic zero - modes minus the number of fermionic zero - modes in a theory containing susy . while susy constrains this difference to be zero for any finite energy , at exactly zero energy </S>",
    "<S> the constraint is lifted . </S>",
    "<S> being a topological invariant , this index is highly stable , and is in particular completely independent of temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that traditionally in the study of topological phases , topological indices result from properties of the bulk insulating phase , and dictate the edge physics through the bulk - boundary correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> the topological invariant we study , on the other hand , is an explicit property of the gapless edge theory itself , revealed by supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possibility of understanding it from the point of view of the bulk topological quantum field theory , and highlight its connection to the entanglement spectrum of a bipartition of the state in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , while topological invariants are generically defined for _ non - interacting _ symmetry protected topological phases , supersymmetry provides us with tools to define topological invariants for _ strongly interacting _ rr states .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , any perturbation preserving supersymmetry does not alter the above structure . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see , susy is a robust property of the @xmath4 laughlin state . </S>",
    "<S> however , in other experimentally relevant states , given by filling factors of the form @xmath14 , inter - mode interaction terms generally break susy . </S>",
    "<S> however , imprints of susy may still be observed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for weak susy breaking terms , the difference between the number of bosonic and fermionic states near zero energy is still given by the witten index . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss the possibility of susy re - emerging in the presence of edge reconstruction . finally , we briefly discuss the possibility of measuring the robust zero - modes in a small circular edge configuration .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the system : _ the system we study is made of a two - dimensional electron gas in the quantum hall regime </S>",

    "<S> this prompts us to regard @xmath64 as a topological invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> the relation ( [ h_from_q_complex ] ) can be used to show that the zero modes of @xmath40 are given by the states that satisfy @xmath70 , but can not be written as @xmath71 for some state @xmath72 @xcite . clearly , since @xmath73 , any state of the form @xmath74 is annihilated by @xmath69 . </S>",

    "<S> the number of zero modes in this case is given by @xmath88 and is also known as the dimension of the chiral ring of the susy system @xcite .    the above topological invariant @xmath64 , and the number of zero modes @xmath89 are associated with the edge of the quantum hall system , but can be connected with properties of the bulk through the bulk - boundary correspondence . in particular , if we consider a bipartition in the quantum hall system ( fig [ fig : entanglement_cut ] ) , we will find that the entanglement hamiltonian along the boundary of the bipartition is precisely given by the hamiltonian of the low - energy chiral edge theory @xcite , which exhibits susy , and in particular displays @xmath64 and @xmath89 as characteristics of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this prompts us to expect that supersymmetry may arise directly from bulk properties .    _ </S>",
    "<S> physical perturbations : _ being a symmetry which does not occur commonly in condensed matter systems , it is natural to ask to which extent susy is robust . for @xmath4 , any perturbation within the low - energy chiral luttinger liquid theory merely renormalizes the fermi velocity . in this case , susy is indeed protected as long as coupling to other low - energy degrees of freedom can be neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> the particle - hole conjugate of the rr states in the excited landau level , given by @xmath90 are prominent candidates for describing the plateaus observed at @xmath8 and @xmath91 . in this cases , </S>",
    "<S> the edge is described by three co - propagating fermionic modes , and one counter propagating rr edge mode . </S>",
    "<S> density - density interactions between the rr edge mode and the fermionic channels generally break susy </S>",
    "<S> . however , we note that the zero modes associated with the parafermionic sector remain unchanged , as the latter is charge neutral . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the susy breaking perturbations are weak , the overall shape of the spectrum should weakly deviate from the supersymmetric spectrum presented in fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite that in the presence of disorder , such interactions induce an emergent @xmath18 algebra in the counter propagating sector . if edge reconstruction occurs ( see , for example , ref . </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion : _ in this manuscript , we have shown that quantum hall states at filling @xmath5 constitutes a condensed matter realization of an @xmath2 supersymmetric conformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed to use the witten topological index , defined specifically for supersymmetric theories , to count the difference between the bosonic and fermionic zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> we further discussed the stability of the above against perturbations expected to occur in a physical realization . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , susy was found to be a particularly robust property of the laughlin state at filling @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> general arguments dictate that the bipartite entanglement properties of the bulk of the system should also display the susy . given this connection </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that susy invariants could be discovered directly from the bulk low - energy topological field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here , and in particular the presence of susy on the edge , provide a strong indication that a supersymmetric bulk theory , such as the one presented in ref . , are indeed adequate to study the the low - energy physics of such quantum hall states .    </S>",
    "<S> one can in principle measure the predicted zero - modes by creating a small circular edge , in which case the positive energy states acquire an energy @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the circumference of the edge . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the zero - modes become effectively isolated from the rest of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> if , in addition , coupling to the external edge is taken into account , the zero modes are generally expected to slightly deviate from zero energy , and can therefore be distinguished . by measuring the energy spectrum in this case , one can in principle observe the @xmath3 zero modes .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to consider if any of the ideas discussed here can be generalized to other abelian states . given that the electron field in a @xmath94 theory has conformal dimension @xmath95 , the trivial generalization of taking those fields to be the generators of supersymmetry clearly does not work . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the mathematical structure of such abelian states is similar , making it natural to expect the ideas presented here extend to those states as well .    </S>",
