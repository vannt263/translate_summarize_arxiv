    "ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) galaxies are the least luminous ( m@xmath4 ) known galaxies in the universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of individual stars demonstrate that ufd galaxies are dark matter dominated @xcite .",
    "they obey the metallicity@xmath0luminosity relation found in the brighter , classical spheroidals ( dsphs ) , and have large internal metallicity spreads greater than 0.5dex @xcite .",
    "recent hst photometry extending below the main sequence turn@xmath0off demonstrates that at least three ufds ( hercules , ursa major i and leo iv ) are composed exclusively of ancient stars old @xcite .",
    "these data further suggest that the star formation lasted for less than in spite of this small age spread , the large metallicity spread in ufds is indicative of a complex formation history .",
    "metallicity spreads can arise in different ways .",
    "star formation in a ufd may proceed continuously or in bursts within a single halo , _ on average _ increasing its metallicity over time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inhomogeneous gas mixing can also lead to a wide range of stellar metallicities within a single satellite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the merger of multiple progenitors with different mean metallicities may also produce a wide metallicity spread , as seen in recent simulations of more massive satellites @xcite .",
    "determining more detailed abundances of stars in the ufds will provide insight into the history of star formation at these very early epochs .",
    "the @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios , including [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] , provide important constraints on the chemical evolution history of a stellar population . in the most metal@xmath0poor stars , the ism is polluted by the products of massive stellar evolution and core - collapse type ii supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the chemical yields from these explosions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) result in super@xmath0solar @xmath1 $ ] values .",
    "these yields may depend on the mass , metallicity , and explosion energy of the supernova .",
    "hence , individual type ii sne may leave a unique signature in the observed abundance patterns , provided that ( a ) the gas did not have sufficient time to mix prior to the formation of the next generation of stars , or ( b ) the number of sne was small , leading to stochastic sampling of the imf .",
    "this would lead to intrinsic scatter in the [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios and/or abnormal abundance ratios .",
    "given their low average metallicities , the ufds are one of the best places to search for the signature of chemical enrichment from metal@xmath0free population iii stars @xcite .    type  ia sne output negligible amounts of alpha@xmath0elements in contrast to iron@xmath0peak elements resulting in lower @xmath1 $ ] with rising [ fe / h ] .",
    "due to the time delay in the onset of type  ia sne , the low @xmath1 $ ] signature is indicative of star formation lasting longer than the minimum time delay , @xcite .",
    "the [ fe / h ] at which @xmath1 $ ] starts to decrease helps constrain the efficiency of star formation ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it thus provides a means to distinguish stellar populations with different origins .",
    "spectroscopic studies of classical dsphs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reported significantly lower @xmath1 $ ] in comparison to the observable milky way halo at .",
    "this result has been used to show that the classical dsphs had a different chemical evolution than the progenitor(s ) of the bulk of the inner milky way halo , which were likely more massive dwarf systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the inner halo pattern , @xcite have reported a population of nearby , low @xmath1 $ ] stars consistent with outer halo membership based on their kinematics , thus providing some indication that accreted systems with low @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios were important contributors to the outer halo .",
    "our knowledge of the distribution of chemical abundances in ufds , their chemical evolution , and their similarity / difference with the halo stars , is still limited .",
    "high - resolution ( r @xmath6 20,000 ) abundance studies have begun to address these issues in the ufds by targeting the brightest rgb stars for abundance analysis .",
    "these include studies of ursa majorii and coma berenices ( @xcite , 3 stars in each galaxy ) , segue  1 ( @xcite , 1 star ) , leo  iv ( @xcite , 1 star ) , botes  i ( @xcite ; 7 stars ; @xcite , 1 star ; @xcite , 7 stars ) , and hercules ( @xcite , 2 stars ; @xcite , 11 stars ) .",
    "these studies have primarily targeted the regime .",

    "thus , the role of the ufds in building even the most metal@xmath0poor end of the inner halo is still unclear .",
    "high@xmath0resolution abundance studies of ufds are currently limited to relatively bright stars with apparent magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "coupled with the sparseness of the rgbs in ufd systems , high@xmath0resolution abundance studies using 8@xmath010 meter class telescopes remain impractical for large samples . for example , the faintest star in a ufd studied to date at high@xmath0resolution is the _",

    "we conservatively define an abundance ratio between two alpha elements ( [ x / y ] ) as anomalous if ( a ) the abundance ratio is more than 1@xmath172 greater than @xmath173 or 1@xmath172 less than @xmath174 , _ and _ ( b ) the abundance ratio is discrepant by more than 1@xmath172 from the mean computed for the entire ufd sample , .",
    "we tentatively identify anomalous abundance ratios in two stars , one of which is the object reported in @xcite .",
    "our measurement for that star is [ mg / ca ] @xmath175 at .",
    "the mean [ mg / ca ] for the subsample with both [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] measurements is ( error on the mean ) .",
    "we caution that only 10 stars have a [ mg / fe ] measurement , due to the weakness of mg spectral features , making this subsample small .",
    "we also identify in uma  ii a single star with an anomalous [ si / ca ] abundance ratio , where the mean [ si / ca ] ratio for our sample is .",
    "this star is also studied by @xcite as uma  ii@xmath0s2 , but they only report an upper limit on [ si / fe ] . using their [ si / fe ] upper limit and their [ ca / fe ] measurement ,",
    "we obtain , consistent with our measurement . in total",
    ", we measure a moderately anomalous [ si / ca ] ratio in 1 out of 26 stars , and an anomalous [ mg / ca ] ratio in 1 out of 10 stars .",
    "our results suggest that the fraction of stars with anomalous ratios of two alpha elements is small .",
    "the distribution of alpha abundances allows to us to build a general picture of chemical evolution in the ufds .",
    "the first explosions from population iii ( pop iii ) and/or massive pop ii stars provide the initial chemical enrichment of the ufd s ism , depositing large quantities of alpha elements into the gas from which later stars form .",
    "the low [ fe / h ] , high @xmath1 $ ] stars in our sample are formed from metal@xmath0enriched gas from these early sne .",
    "this is a general feature in all of our ufds . in contrast , our sample includes ufds with and without low @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios at high [ fe / h ] .",
    "we note that the two dwarfs without low @xmath1_{\\rm{avg}}$ ] both have m@xmath176 .",
    "hence , this distinction may still hint at a threshold for significant chemical evolution at m@xmath177 .",
    "however , com  ber also has m@xmath176 but does contain low @xmath1_{\\rm{avg}}$ ] stars .",
    "in addition to the general trend with [ fe / h ] , we note that there is a hint for an increase in scatter ( beyond the observational uncertainties ) in @xmath1_{\\rm{avg}}$ ] at lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "this may hint towards inhomogeneous chemical enrichment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the products of individual sne contaminate different regions of the ism without complete mixing .",
    "we discuss the two different abundance patterns in turn , but strongly caution that this distinction may only be the result of small samples for individual ufds .",
    "every bright ufd in our sample with m@xmath179 ( cvn  ii , leo  iv , uma  i , herc , and leo  t ) contain stars with solar or subsolar @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios , the majority of which cluster at high [ fe / h ] .",
    "the presence of low @xmath1 $ ] ratios is a strong indicator that star formation proceeded at least as long as needed for type  ia sne to explode .",
    "the minimum time delay between the onset of star formation and the first type  ia sne , @xmath180 , is not yet constrained precisely , but may be as short as @xmath181 myr ( see review by @xcite ) . in our discussion , we adopt .",
    "thus , the low @xmath1 $ ] stars suggest that star formation in these ufds lasted longer than @xmath180 , and that the first generation of type  ii sne does not succeed in quenching star formation in these systems .",
    "additionally , the decrease in @xmath1 $ ] ratios at @xmath182}\\sim{-2.5}$ ] suggest a very small level of self@xmath0enrichment prior to the onset of type  ia sne .",
    "this is consistent with a system with a very low star formation rate .",
    "the seg  1 and uma  ii ufds are the only systems which do not show any low @xmath1 $ ] stars .",
    "this suggests that star formation lasted less than @xmath183 .",
    "in contrast to all other ufds , the high @xmath1 $ ] stars extend to much higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "such high [ fe / h ] stars are difficult to explain using the trends found for the other ufds , i.e. systems with low star formation efficiencies .",
    "@xcite have recently described a scenario for such _",
    "one@xmath0shot chemical enrichment_. in this picture , after the first pop  iii stars , there is a single epoch of star formation , after which all gas is blown out of the system by sne feedback or reionization . in this picture",
    ", the large spread in [ fe / h ] arises from highly inhomogeneous gas mixing , as also pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "large [ fe / h ] spreads can perhaps instead be the result of accretion of multiple progenitor systems , each with a different metallicity @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the early loss of gas before @xmath180 is gas stripping due to accretion onto the milky way .",
    "we thus consider in more detail the different possibilities for the quenching of star formation , taking into account our @xmath1 $ ] results for each ufd .",
    "we saw above that uma  ii and seg  1 show hints of truncated star formation .",
    "if this is due to gas stripping due to accretion into the milky way , then the time of accretion into the halo should be comparable to the time of star formation quenching .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the relation between time of infall and present@xmath0day galactocentric position and line@xmath0of sight velocities of subhalos in the via lactea  2 simulation , calculating the probability distribution of the infall time for ufds and classical dsphs ( their figure 4 ) .",
    "interestingly , only seg  1 and uma  ii , the two ufds with flat patterns , show a significant probability of infall onto the milky way halo more than 12 ago ( com  ber may have an infall time as old as @xmath184 gyr ago ) .",
    "the early infall suggests that gas stripping and/or heating due to accretion played a role in terminating star formation before low @xmath185}}$ ] stars could form .",
    "however , the presence of high [ fe / h ] stars poses a problem to this interpretation , since the presence of high @xmath1 $ ] , high [ fe / h ] stars is attributed to systems with high star formation efficiencies .",
    "thus , it is also possible that internal effects , e.g. , winds from sne , managed to get rid of or heat all of the remaining cold gas reservoir .",
    "in contrast to seg  1 and uma  ii , the other ufds have inferred infall times younger than 10 gyr @xcite . @xcite",
    "have reported upper limits on the duration of star formation of less than @xmath3 gyr for three ufds ( uma  i , herc , leo  iv ) , implying star formation was terminated in the first few gyr after the big bang . @xcite also report a lack of a significant age spread in cvn  ii .",
    "therefore , gas stripping due to accretion likely occurred only after quenching of star formation , thus limiting this process s role in the chemical evolution of the majority of ufds .",
    "the presence of low @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios suggests that star formation lasted for at least in most ufds . assuming that the first pop  iii stars form @xmath186 myr ( @xmath187 ) after the big bang ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the end of star formation likely occurred _",
    "after _ @xmath188",
    ". this approximate upper limit on the redshift at which quenching occurred changes depending on the actual minimum time delay for type  ia sne .",
    "if the minimum time delay for type  ia sne is on the order of 500 myr instead ( five times the value adopted above ) , then quenching happened no earlier than @xmath189 .",
    "the process of reionization likely extends for an extended range in redshift : @xcite .",
    "our data are thus consistent with either internal evolutionary processes , i.e. type  ii sne blowing out the gas or providing enough thermal feedback to suppress the formation of additional stars , or reionization@xmath0driven quenching @xcite . in both scenarios ,",
    "the effect of the first sne explosions ( from pop iii and/or massive pop ii stars ) must still allow for star formation to proceed long enough for type ia sne to explode and enrich the ism .      in ",
    "[ mcmc_results ] , we characterized the distribution of @xmath1 $ ] abundances as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "we showed that the probability that this distribution is drawn from a flat , inner@xmath0halo - like abundance pattern is less than a few percent .",
    "this fully agrees with a picture where the bulk of the inner halo forms from the accretion of a few massive satellites undergoing efficient star formation @xcite , rather than the ufds .    the fractional contribution of stars to the halo from ufds may rise towards lower metallicities .",
    "the milky way halo is known to host extremely metal@xmath0poor stars ( emps ) with .",
    "in contrast to the classical dsphs , the ufds host a significant fraction of emps .",
    "our sample , which is not metallicity@xmath0biased , has 10 emp stars out of 61 . at these low [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the similarity in alpha enhancement between the halo and the combined ufd sample alone does suggest a larger contribution of the ufds or ufd@xmath0like systems to the low metallicity tail of the inner halo . since star formation likely ceased in the ufds significantly prior to being accreted into the milky way potential",
    ", it suggests that the present@xmath0day ufd abundance patterns may be similar to those of ufds accreted in the past , so that a large population of ufds with similar abundance patterns may have contributed to the build@xmath0up of the emp inner halo .",
    "this picture will need to be refined and tested by comparing other species with different nucleosynthetic origins , such as neutron@xmath0capture elements .",
    "for example , high@xmath0resolution studies of small numbers of stars in the ufds suggest that the mean [ ba / fe ] ratio in com  ber @xcite is lower than in uma  ii or botes  i @xcite .",
    "in contrast to com  ber , these two ufds have [ ba / fe ] ratios more similar to those of the milky way inner halo at    as a final note , it is worth emphasizing that a comparison of ufd abundances to the outer halo may provide circumstantial evidence for a stronger link between these two populations .",
    "the few studies to date rely on kinematically selected , nearby halo stars consistent with outer halo membership based on their kinematics and/or calculated orbital motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite in particular show a clearly distinguishable population of low @xmath1 $ ] stars in the range @xmath190}<-0.4 $ ] .",
    "these are likely outer halo stars with high eccentricities , which thus take them as close as the solar radius .",
    "however , orbits calculated to date for a few dsphs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) show that their orbits are not likely to pass as close as the solar galactocentric radius .",
    "all ufds are at present at least as far as @xmath191  kpc .",
    "thus , a full understanding of the ufd / dsph@xmath0outer halo connection awaits a detailed mapping of chemical abundances in the in@xmath0situ outer halo .",
    "we analyze keck / deimos spectroscopy of rgb stars in eight ufds using a spectral matching technique to measure and characterize the distribution of @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios . in this paper , we report [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] , as well as a combined alpha to fe abundance ratio , @xmath1_{\\rm{avg}}$ ] , for 61 stars in these systems .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions as follows :    * out of seven ufds with ancient stellar populations , five ( coma berenices , canes venatici ii , ursa major i , leo  iv and hercules ) show an increase of @xmath1 $ ] towards lower [ fe / h ] , and low @xmath1 $ ] ratios for their highest [ fe / h ] stars , implying that type  ia sne had enough time to pollute the ism .",
    "this suggests that star formation was an extended process , lasting _ at least _",
    "@xmath181 myr , corresponding to the minimum time delay between the onset of star formation and the first type  ia sne .",
    "leo  t , which has a much more extended star formation history , shows the same abundance pattern .",
    "* the remaining two ufds with old populations , segue  1 and ursa major ii , show enhanced @xmath1 $ ] ratios at _ all _ metallicities , ranging from @xmath192}}\\lesssim{-1.0}$ ] . on average , the mean level of alpha@xmath0enhancement in segue",
    "i is higher than in uma  ii by @xmath193 dex .",
    "the absence of low @xmath1 $ ] stars suggests that the star formation period was very short , less than @xmath2 myr . *",
    "the combined population of ufds shows a clear increasing trend in @xmath1 $ ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] , with no evidence for a plateau within our entire metallicity range .",
    "although this _ rise _ in @xmath1 $ ] disagrees with the flat inner halo abundance pattern , a significant number of @xmath7 } < -2.5 $ ] stars in the ufds have abundance ratios consistent with the halo values within the uncertainties .",
    "therefore , the ufd contribution to the extremely metal@xmath0poor star ( emp ) halo abundance pattern may be more significant at the lowest metallicities . * the abundance pattern in the ufds shows some difference with respect to the brighter cvn  i dsph .",
    "we show that , in contrast to the ufd population , there is a hint for a plateau at in cvn  i. this difference suggests that the star formation efficiency in the ufds was lower than in the more luminous dsphs .",
    "we have shown based on @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios that most of the ufds were able to retain gas and form stars long enough for the first type ia sne to explode , and that this evolution proceeded inefficiently .",
    "the use of medium@xmath0resolution spectroscopy has been instrumental in providing us with large enough samples to begin to address the evolution of these systems .",
    "future studies will aim to study the details of this evolution by comparing the shape of the metallicity distribution function of each ufd to chemical evolution models .",
    "for instance , evidence for a rapid shutdown in star formation due to reionization may appear as an abrupt cutoff in the metallicity distribution function at the higher [ fe / h ] end .",
    "due to the sparseness of the rgbs of the ufds , it will become necessary to extend the power of multiplex spectroscopic observations to the main sequence of the ufds in order to obtain statistically significant samples to achieve this goal .",
