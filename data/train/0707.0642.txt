    "turbulent flows are ubiquitous , and they are linked to many issues in the geosciences , as in meteorology , oceanography , climatology , ecology , solar  terrestrial interactions and fusion , as well as the generation and ensuing dynamics of magnetic fields in planets , stars and galaxies due to e.g. convective fluid motions . as manifestations of one of the last outstanding unsolved problems of classical physics , such flows form today the focus of numerous investigations .",
    "natural flows are often in a turbulent state driven by large scale forcing ( novae explosions in the interstellar medium ) or by instabilities ( convection in the sun ) .",
    "such flows involve a huge number of coupled modes at different scales leading to great complexity both in their temporal dynamics and in their emerging physical structures .",
    "nonlinearities prevail when the reynolds number @xmath0  which measures the amount of active temporal or spatial scales in the problem  is large . in the kolmogorov framework",
    "@xcite , the number of degrees of freedom increases as @xmath1 for @xmath2 ; for example in geophysical flows , @xmath0 is often larger than @xmath3 .",
    "the ability to probe large @xmath0 , and to examine in details the large - scale behavior of turbulent flows depends critically on the ability to resolve such a large number of spatial and temporal scales , or else to model them adequately .",
    "only modest reynolds numbers can be achieved by direct numerical simulation ( dns ) with nowadays computers .",
    "one way around this difficulty is to resort to large eddy simulations ( or les , see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such techniques are widely used in engineering contexts , as well as in atmospheric sciences and , to a lesser extent , in geophysics ( see @xcite ) and astrophysics .",
    "another class of models is based on two - point closures , like the eddy damped quasi normal markovian approximation , or edqnm @xcite .",
    "these models , developed in the mid seventies , gave rise to successful les when taking their eddy viscosity formulation @xcite .",
    "such les techniques have been used mostly in conjunction with pseudo - spectral methods , since being best expressed in fourier space in terms of energy spectra .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new les formulation that generalizes the usual edqnm approach which is based on a kolmogorov @xmath4 spectrum ( k41 hereafter ) , by allowing for a priori any kind of energy spectrum as may occur in the complex dynamical evolution of various turbulent flows , since our method ( as will be shown later ) is based on the evaluation of the transfer terms for energy and helicity . for example , there are small intermittency corrections to the k41 spectrum due to the presence of strong localized vortex filament structures in fluid turbulence ; similarly , the presence of waves may alter the energy spectrum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the method proposed here",
    "may also be particularly important when dealing with magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) flows , i.e. when coupling the velocity to the magnetic induction . in that case , the energy spectra can be either shallower @xcite or steeper than @xmath4 , because of anisotropy induced by a uniform magnetic field leading to alfvn wave propagation and to weak turbulence for strong magnetic background @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the case of strong correlations between velocity and magnetic fields @xcite , spectra that differ from the classical k41 phenomenology may emerge .",
    "note that , although we focus here on neutral flows , the extension of our model to conductive mhd flows presents no particular difficulties @xcite .",
    "in general , the traditional formulation of turbulent energy transfers only takes into account the energy of the flow but not its helicity . however , the closure transfer terms for helicity are well known in the helical case @xcite , including in mhd @xcite .",
    "the kinetic helicity @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the vorticity ) represents the lack of invariance of the flow by plane symmetry ( @xmath7 is an axial vector ) .",
    "this global invariant of the euler equation @xcite has been little studied until recently ( see however @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the intermittent structures that populate a turbulent flow at small scales , namely the vortex filaments , are known to be helical ( see @xcite ) ; this implies that the nonlinear transfer terms involving small scales are weakened .",
    "this is consistent with several recent findings , namely : ( i ) helical vortex tubes , in a wavelet decomposition of a turbulent flow into a gaussian component and a structure component , represent close to 99% of the energy and corresponds to the strong tails of the probability distribution function of the velocity gradients @xcite ; ( ii ) in a decomposition of the velocity field into large v and small v components , dropping ( artificially ) the nonlocal ( in scale ) nonlinear interactions ( vv ) leads to less intermittency @xcite , indicating that intermittency involves interactions between structures ( like vortex tubes ) that incorporate small scales and large ( integral ) scales through a large aspect ratio ; and ( iii ) the spectrum of helicity is close to @xmath4 in the k41 range for energy , but not quite : the relative helicity @xmath8 decreases more slowly than 1/k @xcite , indicating that the return to full isotropy is not as fast as one may have conjectured in the small scales .",
    "finally , helicity is also invoked as possibly responsible for the so - called bottleneck effect , i.e. the accumulation of energy at the onset of the dissipation range @xcite , although it is not clear whether this effect is or not an inertial range phenomenon @xcite .",
    "our dynamical spectral les model , based on the edqnm closure , is described in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "numerical tests of the model are performed by comparisons with three - dimensional direct numerical simulations ( dns ) for strong helical abc flows @xcite , as well as a chollet - lesieur approach @xcite .",
    "predictions for high reynolds number flows are also given .",
    "section iv is the conclusion .",
    "finally , details on closure expressions of the nonlinear transfers for energy and helicity , and on the numerical implementation of the model are respectively given in appendix a and b.",
    "let us consider the fourier transform of the velocity @xmath9 and the vorticity @xmath10 fields at wavevector @xmath11 : @xmath12 @xmath13 in terms of the fourier coefficients of the velocity components , the navier - stokes equation for an incompressible flow , with constant unit density , reads : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the driving force , @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath17 is a bilinear operator written as : @xmath18 @xmath19 is the projector on solenoidal vectors . in the absence of viscosity , both the total kinetic energy @xmath20 and the total helicity @xmath5",
    "are conserved and they are thus thought to play an important dynamical role in the temporal evolution of the fluid . the direct cascade of energy to the small scales and the related cascade of helicity @xcite stem from these conservation laws .",
    "furthermore , because helicity is thought to play an important role in the small scales ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein and more recently @xcite ) , we are taking in this paper the approach of following the time evolution of both the energy and helicity spectra ( see below ) . taking the rotational of eq .",
    "( [ nsf ] ) in fourier space leads to : @xmath21 with @xmath22    we respectively define the modal spectra of energy @xmath23 and helicity @xmath24 in the usual way as : @xmath25 @xmath26 where stars stand for complex conjugates .",
    "note that @xmath27 is a pseudo ( axial ) vector , and correspondingly the helicity is a pseudo scalar .",
    "the integration of @xmath23 and @xmath24 over shells of radius @xmath28 respectively gives the isotropic energy @xmath29 and helicity @xmath30 spectra .",
    "their spatio - temporal evolutions obey the following equations : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote energy and helicity nonlinear transfers at wavenumber @xmath34 .",
    "they are functionals of the tensors involving triple correlations between @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 with the constraint that @xmath38 due to the convolution term in fourier space emanating from the nonlinearities of the primitive navier - stokes equation .",
    "finally , under the closure hypothesis customary to the edqnm approach ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the time evolution of @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be described by the edqnm equations where the exact transfer terms @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the equations above are replaced by the closure evaluations denoted as @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the closure is done at the level of fourth - order correlators which are expressed in terms of third - order ones , with a proportionality coefficient  dimensionally , the inverse of a time  taken as the sum of all characteristic rates appearing in a given problem , namely the linear ( dispersive ) , nonlinear and dissipative rates . tested against dns @xcite , these closures allow for exponential discretization in fourier space and hence for exploration of high reynolds number regimes .",
    "their drawback is that all information above second - order moments is lost and phase information among fourier modes is lost as well , so that , for example , intermittency is not present in this approach , nor are spatial structures .",
    "the full formulation of the edqnm closure leads to a set of coupled integro - differential equations for the energy and helicity spectra @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with the nonlinear transfers decomposed into emission terms ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , and absorption terms ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) ; note that we use @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with @xmath51,$ ] as short - hand notations for the full spectral functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the expressions of these closure transfer terms are given in appendix a. note that absorption terms are linear in the spectra , the dynamical evolution of which we are seeking , whereas emission terms are inhomogeneous terms involving the @xmath54 wavenumbers on which the double sum is taken ( with @xmath38 ) .",
    "the absorption term , @xmath45 , leads to the classical concept of eddy viscosity , whereas the emission term , @xmath41 , is in general modeled as an eddy noise , although it is known through both experiments and dns that the small scales are far from following a gaussian distribution , with substantial wings corresponding to strong localized structures . here",
    ", we present a different and novel method to treat the emission term .",
    "when dealing with an les method , as a complement in the unresolved small scales to the dynamical evolution of the large scales following the navier - stokes equation , we need to partition fourier space into three regions .",
    "this means that we need to introduce a buffer region between the scales that are completely resolved ( above @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a cut - off wavenumber depending on the resolution of the les run ) , and the scales that are completely unresolved , say beyond @xmath57 with @xmath58 of @xmath59 .",
    "following @xcite and according to the test field model closure , the contribution of subgrid scales , to the explicitely resolved inertial scales , leads to an eddy viscosity depending both on the wavenumber and the energy spectrum at that wavenumber .",
    "it is also shown that beyond @xmath60 , 85% of the transfer is covered by the eddy viscosity , while beyond @xmath61 , about 100% is covered ; we thus choose to take @xmath62 .",
    "more specifically , the truncation of equations ( [ nsf ] ) , ( [ nsfw ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ helicity ] ) at two different wavenumbers @xmath63 and @xmath64 gives rise to three types of transfer terms , corresponding respectively to local , nonlocal and highly nonlocal interactions ( where locality refers to fourier space , i.e. interactions between modes of comparable wavenumber ) :    \\(i ) the fully resolved transfer terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 involve triadic interactions such that @xmath34 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are all three smaller than @xmath56 ; this interval is denoted @xmath69 ;    \\(ii ) the intermediate nonlocal tranfer terms @xmath70 , in which @xmath67 and/or @xmath68 are contained in the buffer zone between @xmath56 and @xmath61 ( hereafter denoted @xmath71 ) ; and    \\(iii ) the highly nonlocal tranfer terms @xmath72 , in which @xmath67 and/or @xmath68 are larger than @xmath61 ( hereafter denoted @xmath73 ) .",
    "we choose to model @xmath70 and @xmath72 in eqs .",
    "( [ energy ] ) and ( [ helicity ] ) by appropriately modified edqnm transfer terms .",
    "we therefore need to know the behavior of both energy and helicity spectra after the cut - off wavenumber @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the linear grid resolution of the numerical simulation . whereas it is customary to assume a @xmath4 kolmogorov spectrum in this intermediate range , here we choose a different approach , namely , between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , both spectra are assumed to behave as power - laws ( with unspecified spectral indices ) followed by an exponential decrease , viz .",
    ": @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 are evaluated , at each time step , by a mean square fit of the energy and helicity spectra , respectively .",
    "note that it is understood that the schwarz inequality @xmath83 is fulfilled at all times . when either @xmath78 or @xmath81 is close to zero , we consider that the energy ( or helicity ) spectrum has an infinite inertial range with a @xmath84 power law ( see eq .",
    "( [ annick1 ] ) ) , so we can write : @xmath85      in the context of spectral models for the navier - stokes equation , the concept of eddy viscosity was introduced by kraichnan @xcite .",
    "this transport coefficient , denoted @xmath86 , allows to model the nonlinear transfer through a dissipative mechanism , as first hypothesized by heisenberg . with @xmath87 and @xmath88 terms defined above , and where the hat denotes the fact that the edqnm formulation of these partial transfers is taken , the eddy viscosity reads : @xmath89 thus separating the contribution stemming from the buffer zone ( @xmath71 ) and from the outer zone ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "note that only the part of the transfer proportional to the energy spectrum at wavenumber @xmath34 ( i.e. the @xmath90 part defined in appendix a ) is taken into account in the derivation of @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , in our model , the closure transfer term @xmath92 is integrated at each time step , but an eddy viscosity from this whole transfer term can not be extracted ; only the part that explicitely contains @xmath29 ( the linear part of the transfer in e(k , t ) ) enables the derivation of an eddy viscosity , namely : @xmath93 let us now evaluate the eddy viscosity in the outer region , @xmath94 , coming from the highly nonlocal edqnm transfer terms .",
    "since the ( @xmath34,@xmath67,@xmath68 ) triangles are very elongated in the @xmath73 zone , with @xmath95 , an algebraical simplification occurs leading to an explicit expression for @xmath94 .",

    "altogether , the same total eddy viscosity appears in both the energy and helicity equations .",
    "this is expected from the formulation of the spectral closure , in which the temporal dynamics of the second - order velocity correlation function is separated into its symmetric ( energetic ) and anti - symmetric ( helical ) parts .      at wavenumber @xmath34 ,",
    "the energy transfer obtained from the use of the edqnm closure involves a linear term in the helicity spectrum @xmath30 ( specifically , @xmath113 defined in appendix a , eq . [ s_e ] ) ; from this term , a new transport coefficient , similar to the @xmath108 eddy viscosity , can be built . in the buffer zone",
    ", this new coefficient , hereafter named `` helical eddy diffusivity '' , reads : @xmath114 note that , dimensionally , this helical diffusivity @xmath115 scales as @xmath116 . as before a total helical eddy diffusivity can be defined as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 represents the contribution of the small - scale helicity spectrum to the kinetic energy dissipation .",
    "recall that , in the outer zone , the taylor expansion of the highly nonlocal transfer , @xmath119 , with respect to @xmath120 , leads at first order to eq .",
    "( [ ener ] ) , with no linear contribution from @xmath30 .",
    "we therefore assume that the transfer part associated with helical motions in the outer zone is negligible , such as @xmath121 .",
    "the total helical eddy diffusivity thus reduces to @xmath122 .",
    "the parts of the edqnm transfer terms which are not included either in the eddy viscosity or in the helical eddy diffusivity , involve energy and helicity interactions at wavenumbers @xmath67 and @xmath68 both larger than @xmath56 .",
    "respectively denoted @xmath123 and @xmath124 , they read : @xmath125 where @xmath126 stands for @xmath127 .    on the one hand ,",
    "the established eddy viscosity and helical eddy diffusivity can be directly used in the navier - stokes equation for the modal energy and helicity spectra , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "on the other hand , in order to implement in these modal equations , the isotropic transfers @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we assume that they are uniformly distributed among all @xmath130 wavevectors belonging to the same k - shell .",
    "this means that the nonlocal modal energy and helicity transfers , respectively @xmath131 and @xmath132 , can be expressed as @xmath133 and @xmath134 .      to compute our les model for all @xmath135",
    ", we proceed in two steps . at a given time",
    ", the navier - stokes equation is first solved using the eddy viscosity and the helical eddy diffusivity , namely : @xmath136    then , the effects of the emission terms , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , are introduced in the numerical scheme . in most previous studies ,",
    "these terms are taken into account through a random force , uncorrelated in time ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; this corresponds to the vision that they represent an eddy noise originating from the small scales .",
    "however , the small scales are all but uncorrelated noise ; the phase relationships within the small - scale structures play an important role , albeit not fully understood , in the flow dynamics .",
    "it is well - known that a random field with a @xmath4 kolomogorov energy spectrum , but otherwise random phases of the fourier coefficients , is very different from an actual turbulent flow , lacking , in particular , the strong vortex tubes so prevalent in highly turbulent flows .",
    "similarly , it has been recently shown @xcite that , upon phase randomization , the ratio of nonlocal energy transfer ( i.e. the transfer involving widely separated scales ) to total energy transfer reduces to a negligible amount , whereas this ratio is close to 20 % at the resolutions of the performed numerical experiments , corresponding to a taylor reynolds number of about @xmath139 .",
    "these considerations lead us to directly incorporate the emission terms in the second step of the our numerical procedure .",
    "the modal spectra of the energy and the helicity , associated to the @xmath140 field computed from eq .",
    "( [ nsfmodel ] ) , now has to verify the following equations where the emission transfer terms are taken into account ; @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 denote the spectral terms stemming from the driving force .",
    "recall that @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the resolved transfer terms based on triadic velocity interactions with @xmath34 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 all smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "once the uptaded @xmath23 and @xmath24 modal spectra are obtained , the velocity field is updated .",
    "however , a difficulty immediately arises : the phase relationships between the three components of the velocity field in the edqnm ( and other ) closures is of course a priori lost .",
    "we thus proceed to the reconstruction of the three spectral velocity components , written as @xmath146 , and rebuild the different velocity phases by using the incompressibility and realisability ( @xmath147 ) conditions , as explained in appendix b.",
    "in order to assess the model accuracy to reproduce the physics involved in fluid flows , we performed direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equation and computations using our les formulation .",
    "we denote les p the code with partial recovery of phases and without helical effects ( i.e. , with @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) , and les ph the code with helical effects incorporated . in our les description ,",
    "the energy spectra - and helicity spectra when considered - of the subgrid scales self adapt to the large scale resolved spectra ( _ i.e. _ no spectral scaling laws are prescribed ) .",
    "we can therefore study a variety of flows , such as either low or high reynolds number flows , or the early phases of the temporal development of flows when kolmogorov spectra are not yet established .",
    "indeed , the cut - off wavenumber , @xmath56 , can as well lie in the dissipation range instead of the inertial range which is the case of standard les approaches based on closures together with a @xmath4 kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "this enables accurate comparisons with dns at a given viscosity .",
    "we also compared our numerical approach to a chollet - lesieur les model ( cl ) @xcite , where a @xmath150 kinematic viscosity is added to the turbulent viscosity for comparison purpose ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",

    "helical effects in turbulents flows , like in vortex filaments , are also considered through the evaluation of the energy and helicity transfers . for this purpose , an `` helical eddy diffusivity '' , similar to an eddy viscosity , and the emission transfer terms in which the helicity spectrum appears , are incorporated in a second model .",
    "numerical tests of our two methods , with and without helical effects included , are performed against dns computations .",
    "the spectral , statistical and spatial behaviors at large and intermediate scales of dns flows are well restaured in both modeled flows .",
    "we notice some advantages for the model including helical effects , in particular , concerning the evaluation of the helicity spectra and the probability distributions of the lateral velocity field gradients .",
    "les ph also predicts a 4/3 spectrum for the helicity all the way to the cut - off , a point that will need further study .",
    "however , in our approach , we need to calculate at each time step the non local energy ( and helicity ) transfers , with an increased computational cost ( roughly by a factor 2 ) , when compared with other spectral les models @xcite . whereas the role of helicity in fluids is not necessarily dynamically dominant ,",
    "such is not the case in mhd where both kinetic and magnetic helicity play a prominent role , the former in the dynamo process and the latter in its undergoing an inverse cascade to large scales ; furthermore , in mhd , spectra are not necessarily kolmogorovian and the models presented in this paper may be of some use in mhd as well .",
    "the extension to mhd turbulent flows , with coupled velocity and magnetic fields , presents no major difficulties and is under study .",

    "for completeness , we recall here the expressions of the nonlinear transfer terms for the energy and the helicity , @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively , under the edqnm closure assumption @xcite : @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the integration domain with @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that ( @xmath222 ) form a triangle , and @xmath223 is the relaxation time of the triple velocity correlations . as usual @xcite , @xmath223 is defined as : @xmath224 where @xmath225 expresses the rate at which the triple correlations evolve , i.e. under viscous dissipation and nonlinear shear .",

    "( [ s_e ] ) and ( [ s_h ] ) , the geometric coefficients @xmath233 and @xmath234 ( in short , @xmath235 and @xmath236 ) are defined as : @xmath237 where @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 are the cosines of the interior angles opposite to @xmath241 .",
    "let us now introduce a cut - off wavenumber @xmath56 , and define the following three zones for the integration domain @xmath221 of eqs .",

    "the resolved transfers write :    @xmath242    where @xmath19 is the projector on solenoidal vectors , as stated before .",
    "the transfers of energy and helicity between the buffer zone and the inner zone become : @xmath243 and the transfers of energy and helicity between the outer zone and the inner zone read : @xmath244",
    "as a first step , the navier - stokes equation is solved with the eddy viscosity and the helical eddy diffusivity @xmath86 and @xmath245 ( see eq .  ( [ nsfmodel ] ) . at this intermediate stage , we obtain a partial estimation of the time updated velocity field , since the emission transfer term are not yet taken in to account . from this intermediate velocity ,",
    "we compute the corresponding energy and helicity density fields , say at wavevector @xmath130 .",
    "they are then corrected with the appropriate edqnm emission terms according to eqs .",
    "( [ be - system ] ) and ( [ bh - system ] ) . in the time advance , the next step consists in reconstructing the three velocity components from these updated energy and helicity , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "when the velocity components are expressed as @xmath146 , the incompressibility condition leads to the following system of equations for the velocity phases and amplitudes ( in short @xmath246 and @xmath247 ) : @xmath248 with phase differences @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 standing for the component indices . note that when one component of the vector @xmath130 is equal to zero , this case is treated separately in the code . since only four of these equations are independent ( because of the incompressibility condition ) , we are led to give an arbitrary value for two of the variables .",
