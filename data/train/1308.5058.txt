    "anomalous diffusion arises in a wide range of systems across disciplines and is usually characterized in terms of the mean squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath0 ^ 2\\right>\\simeq t^{2h}\\ ] ] of a random variable @xmath1 , where the anomalous diffusion or hurst exponent @xmath2 distinguishes subdiffusion ( @xmath3 ) from superdiffusion ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "normal ( @xmath5 ) and ballistic ( @xmath6 ) motion are contained as limiting cases . in general , stochastic modelling is the approach of choice when the extent and complexity of a deterministic , multidimensional system prohibits analytical , first principles treatment .",
    "the time evolution of a small subsystem ( for instance , the dispersion of a tracer particle in aquifers , a labelled molecule in a biological cell or the price of an individual stock on the market ) is described in terms of a stochastic process @xmath1 .",
    "examples for anomalous diffusion of the form ( [ msd ] ) range from the motion of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors @xcite over the diffusion of submicron tracers in living biological cells @xcite or the dynamics of small particles in weakly chaotic flows @xcite to the dispersion of chemical tracers in the groundwater @xcite or the dynamics of stock markets @xcite , just to name a few @xcite .    in general anomalous diffusion processes",
    "are not universal and thus their definition through equation ( [ msd ] ) is not unique . instead , the form ( [ msd ] ) may be caused by multiple physical mechanisms , some of which are very distinct conceptually . several pathways to anomalous diffusion have been discussed . among others ,",
    "these include ( i ) trapping mechanisms leading to long sojourn times , ( ii ) long - ranged temporal correlations induced by interaction with a complex surrounding and ( iii ) long - distance displacements .",
    "a prominent approach to mathematically model these effects is via stochastic processes such as continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) @xcite , fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite , or lvy flights and walks @xcite .",
    "they are paradigmatic in the sense that they are designed to tackle one specific key property ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "thus ctrws were proposed as a model for charge carrier transport in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , where individual charges reside on specific , sparsely distributed acceptor sites for long , effectively random time spans , before hopping to a neighbour site .",
    "moreover , crosslinked polymer filament networks as found in mammalian cells can cause similar caging effects for micron - sized objects  @xcite , similarly to multiscale trapping times of particles on sticky surfaces @xcite .",
    "fbm addresses the problem of highly correlated stock market decisions  @xcite and telecommunications @xcite , and the associated fractional gaussian noise fuels the diffusion of a single tracer particle in viscoelastic or crowded environments @xcite .",
    "lvy flights and walks @xcite provide a statistical description for the motion of tracers in weakly chaotic systems  @xcite or of the linear particle diffusion along a fast - folding polymer chain  @xcite .",
    "however , in complex , disordered environments we would expect that more than one of the patterns ( i ) to ( iii ) emerge , compete and collude to generate anomalous diffusion patterns , and it remains an open challenge to identify and differentiate them .",
    "thus , the global properties of dispersion in amorphous media can be related to the microscale flow dynamics by adding a memory component to the standard ctrw description  @xcite .",
    "modern single particle tracking techniques in experiment and simulations indeed corroborate the co - existence of different diffusion mechanisms  @xcite . for instance , for the motion of individual granules in the intracellular fluid of living cells characteristics of ctrw - style trapping and fbm - like anticorrelations",
    "were observed @xcite .",
    "we here introduce a stochastic process , namely the correlated ctrw ( cctrw ) , that merges and extends the classical paradigmatic models of ctrw , fbm , and lvy flights .",
    "we study in particular two quantities , which are typically accessible experimentally : the scaling of the particle position @xmath7 with time @xmath8 , and the shape of the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath9 of the particle displacement @xmath10 at some instant of time @xmath8 .",
    "the result is a very flexible stochastic model , that will be of use for the data analysis of stochastic processes in complex systems .",
    "one immediate lesson is the interplay of the underlying stochastic modes , the blend of which may lead to indistinguishable forms for the pdf @xmath9 for different sets of model parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we define the ingredients of the cctrw model .",
    "first , subsections  [ lf ] and  [ ctrw ] recapitulate the essential definitions and properties of lvy flights and ctrw - trapping theory .",
    "second , we define a correlated version of these models by means of stochastic integration in subsection  [ cctrw ] . the stationarity ( closely related to the physical concept of equilibrium ) of the cctrw is briefly discussed in section  [ stat ] .",
    "we study extensively the scaling behaviour and the pdf of the position coordinate for correlated ctrws in section  [ pdf ] .",
    "the parallels and differences with other correlated ctrw models in the literature are outlined in section  [ comparison ] .",
    "a brief overview on our main results and potential extensions and further studies of the model are summarized in the conclusion , section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the most commonly used theoretical model for ( normal ) diffusion dynamics is the celebrated brownian motion . in its standard form",
    ", this random process describes the dynamics of a point - like particle as an unbiased , continuous but erratic motion in an unbounded embedding space . in the mathematics literature ,",
    "such a process @xmath1 with positive time @xmath11 , is usually referred to as the wiener process , and it is uniquely defined by the following three properties : ( i ) @xmath12 ; ( ii ) a sample trajectory @xmath1 is almost surely continuous everywhere ; ( iii ) increments @xmath13 have a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath14 and variance @xmath15 , and they are mutually independent for any non - overlapping time intervals .",
    "typical sample realisations of brownian motion are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.bm ] .",
    "individual trajectories are indeed characterized by a continuous but non - smooth behaviour .",
    "there is no notable global drift and neither a specific point in time nor some spatial region stands out from the rest . in ensemble measurements ,",
    "brownian motion features a normal diffusive behaviour ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "more generally , the position coordinate scales with time as @xmath16 .",
    "the independence of increments is reflected by the correlation function , @xmath17 for any @xmath18 . in this sense , we call @xmath1 an uncorrelated process .     of ordinary _",
    "brownian motion_. the sample paths are erratic but continuous and at no time a favoured direction can be determined . in the context of correlated continuous time random walks as defined in section  [ cctrw ] , the parameters are : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22.,width=529 ]    thus , brownian motion is an ideal candidate to model the diffusive motion in an environment where the bombardment by small particles from a surrounding heat bath induces vivid but short displacements of a relatively inert , point - like test particle .",
    "the typical example is a micron - scale molecule in a dilute water solution at room temperature , as discussed in albert einstein s groundbreaking studies @xcite and monitored in the seminal works by jean perrin @xcite . there , the momentum transfer from the surrounding water molecules occurs much faster than the average large particle motion observed under a microscope .",
    "displacements of the test particle thus indeed appear to be random and independent , yet small on an observational scale .",
    "however , when we want to describe diffusive dynamics in complex environments , we are forced to drop several of the idealising assumptions ( i ) to ( iii ) .",
    "for instance , in chaotic systems @xcite or in highly disordered optical materials @xcite large scale displacements occur almost instantaneously , resulting in highly non - continuous sample trajectories .",
    "conversely , in disordered environments such as the above - mentioned amorphous semiconductors or the densely crowded intracellular fluid of biological cells , the assumption of a steady time evolution is questionable , since charge carriers or tracer molecules can become trapped in microenvironments or stick to reactive surfaces for long time periods  @xcite .",
    "finally , the independence of increments can not be taken for granted when the particle motion is strongly coupled to its environment , for instance , in single file diffusion  @xcite or in viscoelastic media  @xcite , leading to an effective memory in the history of the motion .    in the following sections , we generalise the standard brownian motion to a larger class of one - dimensional , random motions of a point particle to accommodate the above - mentioned effects .",
    "we proceed stepwise : first , in section  [ lf ] , we introduce the concept of lvy flights ( allowing discontinuities in sample paths ) . in section  [ ctrw ]",
    "we consider ctrws ( with long sojourn times ) . finally in section  [ cctrw ] ,",
    "we generalise to processes defined in terms of stochastic integrals ( to account for fbm - style memory effects ) . on each level of generalisation , we focus our analytical discussion on the study of scaling laws in general , and the evolution of the pdf of the particle position @xmath10 with respect to time @xmath8 , in particular .       of _ lvy flights_.",
    "the motion is uncorrelated and unbiased , but characterized by large - scale , discontinuous jumps . in the context of cctrws as defined in section  [ cctrw ] , the parameters are : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22.,width=529 ]    the first assumption that we drop in order to extend ordinary brownian motion is the continuity of sample paths .",
    "a widely used stochastic approach to model such type of anomalous diffusion property are lvy flights .",
    "this type of idealized random motion is not continuous in space , but instead consists of a series of random jumps , see fig .",
    "[ fig.lf ] .",
    "the jump lengths @xmath25 are characterized by heavy - tailed jump statistics , that is , by pdfs with power - law tails , @xmath26 with @xmath27 for large distances @xmath28 . the key feature of such stable pdfs is the diverging second moment , @xmath29 : discontinuous jumps occur on arbitrary large spatial scales .    to be more precise , we here connect lvy flights with the mathematical concept of a symmetric lvy @xmath30-stable process , @xmath31 .",
    "apart from the discontinuity of individual trajectories , also ensemble properties differ significantly from the brownian case : the capability of covering large distances by single , instantaneous jumps implies a superdiffusive scaling of the position coordinate with time , @xmath32 . in particular , the pdf @xmath33 for the position @xmath7 at time @xmath8 assumes the scaling form @xmath34 where the scaling function @xmath35 is a symmetric @xmath30-stable law .",
    "the latter is uniquely defined in terms of the characteristic function @xmath36 including gaussian statistics in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , in a distributional sense , the limiting case @xmath37 is an ordinary brownian motion .",
    "the scaling function @xmath35 ( and thus the pdf @xmath38 ) has the same heavy - tail property as the pdf of individual jumps , @xmath39 for large @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , second ( and higher ) order moments diverge , @xmath41 .    yet ,",
    "in terms of correlations , lvy flights are on the same level as ordinary brownian motion . indeed ,",
    "both processes are markovian .",
    "the jump lengths @xmath25 are mutually independent and identical in a distributional sense .",
    "consequently , the increments of lvy stable motion @xmath13 , are characterized by mutual independence and distributional equality .       of _ continuous time",
    "random walks ( ctrws)_. the spatially continuous motion is paused for scale - free waiting periods .",
    "this considerably slows down the exploration of space as compared to ordinary brownian motion .",
    "waiting times are heavy - tailed ( see text ) and thus assume values on all time scales , but they are also mutually independent . in the context of cctrws",
    "as defined in section  [ cctrw ] , the parameters are : @xmath19 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44.,width=529 ]    despite their spatial discontinuity , lvy flights are evolving continuously in time , in the sense that the particle remains at any specific position for only an infinitesimal amount of time . to account for the possibility to encounter deep traps on some random energy landscapes ,",
    "a common generalized stochastic model is used , namely , subdiffusive ctrws .",
    "in contrast to ordinary brownian motion or lvy flights , these processes include random long - time trapping periods @xmath45 , usually referred to as waiting times .",
    "these are distributed according to heavy - tailed waiting time statistics , @xmath46 with @xmath47 for large @xmath45 . in close analogy to the effects of scale - free jump lengths for lvy flights , the infinite first moment of the waiting times amounts to immobilisation periods on all time scales , see fig .",
    "[ fig.ctrw ] .    mathematically",
    ", one can model such systems by use of the subordination method @xcite .",
    "an internal time parameter @xmath48 is introduced , which plays the role of the number of jumps performed along the trajectory , that is successively delayed by trapping events .",
    "as this ` internal time ' @xmath48 increases , on the one hand , the spatial exploration evolves according to a process @xmath49 .",
    "the appropriate choice for @xmath49 depends on the characteristics and features of the physical system we intend to describe ( external force fields , drift , friction , etc . ) .",
    "typically , @xmath49 is assumed to be markovian and thus , in the above sense , is continuously evolving in time . as a paradigmatic example , we define @xmath50 , i.e. , the spatial dynamics are modelled in terms of an unbiased and unconfined lvy flight with stable index @xmath27 , as defined in the previous section  [ lf ] .",
    "on the other hand , we model the punctuated progression of real laboratory time as measured by the observer in terms of a separate random process @xmath51 : as the internal time @xmath48 increases , consecutive waiting times accumulate to the laboratory time @xmath51 . in order to model waiting times which are distributed by heavy - tailed statistics , one can simply choose @xmath52 , where @xmath47 .",
    "the latter is a special type of lvy flight itself , namely , a one - sided ( or totally skewed ) lvy @xmath53-stable motion .",
    "it is a positive , strictly increasing process and thus an appropriate representation of the random time progression of the particle motion .",
    "moreover , it has the typical lvy flight property of scale - free discontinuous , jump - like evolution .",
    "statistically , it is characterized by the time scaling @xmath54 and one - sided @xmath53-stable distributions . in particular",
    ", the pdf @xmath55 for the laboratory time @xmath56 at given internal time @xmath48 reads @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is a one - sided @xmath53-stable law .",
    "its most natural representation is via its laplace transform @xmath59 the distribution is heavy - tailed , @xmath60 , so that the expectation value ( and higher order moments ) of the laboratory time diverges , @xmath61 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath62 the pdf in eq .",
    "( [ osstable ] ) becomes a dirac @xmath63-distribution , @xmath64 .",
    "thus , this limiting case restores the equivalence of internal and laboratory time , such that the particle motion is no longer paused for random waiting time periods .    to complete the definition of this type of ctrws we introduce an inverse process @xmath65 which measures the evolution of internal time as function of laboratory time @xmath8 , @xmath66 which is also sometimes referred to as first - hitting time or counting process . the particle motion as seen by the observer is now given by a process @xmath67",
    ", i.e. the random , unsteady progression of internal time is modelled by @xmath65 , while independently the spatial displacements during times of dynamic activity are governed by the process @xmath49 .",
    "individual paths of @xmath1 most notably feature discontinuities in both their spatial and temporal evolution",
    ". meanwhile , ensemble statistics combine the distributional properties of both independent random processes @xmath49 and @xmath65 .",
    "for instance , let @xmath68 denote the pdf for internal time @xmath69 at laboratory time @xmath8 . recall that @xmath70 is the pdf of the position @xmath71 when the internal time @xmath48 has passed .",
    "then the pdf @xmath72 for the particle position @xmath7 at time @xmath8 can by computed as @xmath73    we conclude this section with a remark on correlations in this type of ctrw .",
    "both the displacement dynamics @xmath49 and the laboratory time evolution @xmath51 with respect to internal time @xmath48 belong to the class of lvy flight processes . as such ,",
    "their respective increments are stationary and mutually independent for non - overlapping time intervals . in the language of individual jump distances @xmath25 or waiting times @xmath45 this means that the latter form sequences of mutually independent , identically distributed random variables . as mentioned above , this renewal property might be considered a severe simplification when we want to model real physical systems .",
    "we will therefore drop this property in the following section and define a ctrw where successive jump lengths or waiting times are correlated .      in standard ctrw models , individual jump lengths and waiting times , respectively , are independent of each other .",
    "our goal is to extend this theory to systems where highly complex environments induce long - range correlations . in",
    "that we build on previous results @xcite for non - renewal ctrws in which successive waiting times and/or jump lengths are incrementally varied , such that they represent markovian random walks in the associated spaces of waiting times and jump lengths .",
    "we discuss the parallels with this incremental - correlated ctrw in section  [ comparison ] . in the present paper",
    ", we follow an idea proposed in  @xcite to introduce a process close in spirit to fbm and its heavy - tailed generalisation , the linear fractional @xmath30-stable motion @xcite .",
    "the basic theoretical approach is to derive a correlated process from an uncorrelated one in terms of ( stable ) stochastic integrals . by this method ,",
    "correlations are introduced without altering the distributional properties of the process themselves .    without going into the details of stochastic integrals",
    "@xcite we here provide an exemplary calculation as a motivation for our method .",
    "consider first a discrete time random walk in continuous space , @xmath74 with @xmath75 . at the @xmath76-th step ,",
    "the random walker covers a random jump distance @xmath77 .",
    "if we assume the @xmath78 are mutually independent and identically distributed ( iid ) , we call the random walk @xmath79 an uncorrelated process . for example , define @xmath80 , where the @xmath81 are gaussian iid random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath82 . then the distribution of the position variable @xmath79 follows as ( we assume @xmath83 ) @xmath84 here",
    ", @xmath85 denotes an equality in distribution , and thus the position @xmath79 after the @xmath76-th step also has a gaussian distribution , scaling as @xmath86 .",
    "consequently the `` diffusion '' law , @xmath87 , is normal for this simple , uncorrelated random walk .",
    "note that this result is a generic one , since , by virtue of the central limit theorem , any series of iid random displacements @xmath81 with zero mean and finite variance produces asymptotically gaussian behaviour on sufficiently large scales .",
    "now , how can we add correlations to this simple random walk process , without altering its gaussian nature ?",
    "one method is by means of a linear transformation , as proposed in reference @xcite .",
    "let @xmath81 be iid gaussian random variables as above .",
    "we introduce a nonrandom function @xmath88 , which we will refer to as correlation kernel , and define the correlated jump lengths @xmath89 .",
    "the latter have strong similarities in distribution with their uncorrelated counterparts @xmath78 : both are sequences of gaussian random variables centred at zero . however , the correlated sequence is not necessarily stationary , since @xmath90 .",
    "more severely ,",
    "the @xmath78 are by definition mutually independent , while for the correlated sequence we have , for any @xmath91 , @xmath92 depending on the exact behaviour of the correlation kernel @xmath93 , this covariance function can have either a negative or positive sign , where a positive ( negative ) covariance function indicates a tendency for any two jumps to go in the same ( opposite ) direction .",
    "we can therefore say that the jump lengths are either _ persistent _ or _ antipersistent _ , respectively . only by choosing @xmath94 , @xmath95 denoting the kronecker symbol , the @xmath96",
    "become mutually independent .",
    "the random walk process @xmath97 associated with such correlated jump lengths has the following properties ( again , assume @xmath98 ) : @xmath99 thus , the correlations indeed preserve the gaussian nature of the process .",
    "@xmath97 can itself be written as a linear transformation of the iid gaussian variables @xmath100 in terms of the correlation kernel @xmath101 .",
    "note that we altered the scaling behaviour with the introduction of correlations : in contrast to the normal scaling @xmath86 , the scaling of the process @xmath97 is more complex in general and depends on the exact form of the kernel @xmath101 .",
    "this method of correlating a gaussian random walk can be readily transferred to a time - continuous process such as the lvy flights and ctrws as defined in the previous sections .",
    "let @xmath102 be a lvy flight with stable index @xmath27 . in equation ( [ lintrafo ] )",
    "we now substitute the discrete step number @xmath76 by a continuous ( internal ) time variable @xmath48 and replace the sum over the gaussian iid random variables by a stochastic integration with respect to the lvy stable noise @xmath103 . for the correlation kernel @xmath104",
    "we choose a power - law , so that correlations are potentially of a long - ranged kind .",
    "that is , we define a stochastic process @xmath49 in terms of a stable integral ( dropping the tilde in the following ) : @xmath105 here @xmath27 , and we will refer to @xmath106 as the hurst exponent . with this definition of the process",
    "@xmath71 we stay in the domain of @xmath30-stable processes . in particular , at given time @xmath48 , its probability density function @xmath107 is of the stable form ( [ symstable ] ) , albeit with an altered time scaling @xmath108 , @xmath109 the scaling prefactor @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) makes sure that the scaling function @xmath35 is again exactly represented by the characteristic function in eq .",
    "( [ symstable_fourier ] ) .",
    "what really sets the process @xmath49 apart from the ordinary lvy motion @xmath102 is the stochastic dependence of increments .",
    "we may also say the noise related to @xmath49 is strongly correlated , or coloured .",
    "however , to assess the nature of interdependence here , we can not use the covariance function like in eq .",
    "( [ covariance ] ) .",
    "while the latter is a meaningful and precise measure of dependence for gaussian processes , @xmath19 , it is ill - defined for stable processes @xmath111 . in reference  @xcite , several alternative concepts to deal with the stable cases are introduced and discussed , such as covariation or codifference functions . in short , applying these analytical tools to the correlated process @xmath49 , we find positive , long - range dependence when @xmath112 , and negative , short - range dependence when @xmath113 .",
    "( compare this to the analogous discussion on linear fractional stable motion in  @xcite .",
    "an extensive discussion of the notion of long - range dependence can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "we can also supplement these considerations by spectral analysis arguments , compare also ref .",
    "consider a sample path of a lvy flight @xmath102 and denote its fourier transform by @xmath114 . now since the stable stochastic integral  ( [ y ] ) is of a convolution form , there is a simple relation in fourier space between the correlated noise @xmath115 and the lvy stable noise @xmath103 , namely @xmath116 .",
    "when comparing the two noise types in the case @xmath112 we thus find that the correlation kernel in the stable integral  ( [ y ] ) emphasises the low frequency components of the correlated noise . in a sample path of @xmath49",
    ", we may conceive this as a comparatively steady motion , even in the form of long - term periodic cycles .",
    "conversely , when @xmath113 , high frequencies are amplified .",
    "a sample path @xmath49 is then fluctuating violently as compared to an ordinary lvy flight .",
    "hence , both the analysis in terms of covariation / codifference functions and the spectral analysis support the idea of an either _ persistent _ or _ antipersistent _ motion @xmath49 .",
    "( throughout the rest of this work , such statements are equivalent to saying that the respective increment / noise process is persistent or antipersistent . ) for @xmath112 , persistence effects long cycles of seemingly steady , biased motion .",
    "if @xmath113 , antipersistent motion is observed as being wildly fluctuating , since strong , short range , negative memory leads to a quick succession of directional turns .",
    "the special case @xmath117 recovers ordinary lvy flights with mutually independent jump lengths .",
    "the last step in the definition of our cctrw model is the introduction of correlations of waiting times .",
    "analogously to the above , we define @xmath118 in terms of a stable integral with respect to one - sided lvy @xmath53-stable noise @xmath119 . here , @xmath47 and @xmath120 .",

    "thus , correlations in waiting times are necessarily of the persistent type , and have a tendency to increase with @xmath48 .",
    "the only exception to this rule is @xmath125 , a parameter setting which brings us back to heavy - tailed but uncorrelated waiting times .    in complete analogy to the uncorrelated case we now introduce the inverse process @xmath65 according to equation ( [ s ] ) and combine it with a correlated stable motion , @xmath67 .",

    "conversely , nonstationary statistics of travel distances can be a signature for an adaptive search strategy , an aging animal , or changes in the environment . in this case",
    ", we could further ask whether or not such internal or external variations are stationary .",
    "this relates to second order increments . on smaller scales ,",
    "@xmath49 could be a model for particle diffusion in a heat bath . there",
    ", nonstationarity of first order increments is the fingerprint either of an inhomogeneous environment ( i.e. , the particle displacement statistics changes as the particle explores various spatial regions ) or a non - equilibrated environment ( i.e. , the noise imposed by interaction with the surrounding heat bath is itself nonstationary ) .",
    "then , analysis of second and higher order increments yields information on the precise nature of the spatial or temporal variations in the surroundings .",

    "the latter vanishes identically if @xmath117 .",
    "this is natural , since these cases are the symmetric lvy stable motions , @xmath50 , which have stationary increments by definition .",
    "conversely , for any @xmath149 , the integral differs from zero , so in general the first order increments of the stable motion @xmath49 are nonstationary . however , they can still be asymptotically stationary , depending on the parameters .",
    "the expression in the integral @xmath148 behaves , for large @xmath150 , like @xmath151 .",
    "the asymptotics at large times @xmath152 are therefore given through @xmath153 first order increments are hence asd whenever @xmath154 , while spreading indefinitely when @xmath155 .",
    "we can readily extend the procedure to the study of increments of arbitrary order , see  [ app : stationarity ] .",
    "in general , we have to distinguish two classes of parameter settings .    if we can find a nonnegative integer @xmath156 such that @xmath157 , then all increments of order @xmath158 are stationary in distribution , and lower order increments , @xmath159 on average broaden .",
    "this includes the lvy stable motions , @xmath160 , @xmath117 , with stationary increments of all orders . to understand this ,",
    "recall that correlated and lvy stable noises are related in fourier space through @xmath161 .",
    "now for @xmath157 , this suggests we can interpret @xmath49 as an @xmath156-fold repeated integration of a lvy stable noise . in other words , for @xmath160 , @xmath49 is a lvy flight , so increments are stationary ; for @xmath162 , the noise generating @xmath49 is already a lvy flight , therefore only second and higher order increments of @xmath49 are stationary ; for @xmath163 , the noise generating the noise of @xmath49 is a lvy flight , so we find stationary third order increments ; _ etc_.",
    "the opposite case is @xmath164 for all nonnegative integers @xmath156 .",
    "interestingly , here the result is @xmath30-independent : all increments of order @xmath165 are asd , while lower order increments , @xmath166 , are spreading indefinitely .",
    "an extensive and mathematically rigorous treatment of stochastic processes with stationary @xmath76th order increments can be found in  @xcite .    the one - sided @xmath53-stable process ( [ t ] ) , which describes the evolution of laboratory time with respect to the internal time has completely analogous properties .",
    "increments of any order are stationary if @xmath125 , since then @xmath52 is a one - sided lvy stable motion . if there is a nonnegative integer @xmath156 such that @xmath167 , then only increments of order @xmath158 are stationary in distribution .",
    "if there is no such @xmath156 , increments of orders @xmath168 are asd .",
    "lower order increments are nonstationary at all times .",
    "note , however , that for the waiting time process we are forced to require @xmath120 for the following reason .",
    "writing out the integral representation for the first order increments , @xmath169\\mathrm{d}l^+_\\alpha(s ' ) \\right.\\\\ & & \\quad\\left.+\\int_s^{s+\\tau}(s+\\tau - s')^{g-1/\\alpha}\\mathrm{d}l^+_\\alpha(s ' ) \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the first integral could potentially give a negative contribution when @xmath170 .",
    "this is clearly unacceptable in terms of causality : negative increments in laboratory time @xmath51 would correspond to waiting times finishing earlier than they began .",
    "we therefore consider only @xmath120 , which has two implications . on the one hand ,",
    "as mentioned above , correlated motions are necessarily persistent . on the other hand , first order increments  reflecting waiting time statistics  are nonstationary .",
    "more precisely , they are , in a statistical sense , increasing beyond all bonds , as their ( one - sided ! ) distribution continuously broadens with internal time @xmath48 .",
    "we conclude this section with a general remark on stationarity in ctrw models . the inverse process @xmath65 measuring the internal time at fixed laboratory time @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) , is a highly nonstationary process , as are all of its increments .",
    "this holds even when @xmath125 , i.e. when waiting times are not correlated .",
    "this phenomenon has been discussed extensively in the ctrw literature , where it is commonly referred to as aging  @xcite and is closely related to other peculiar effects such as weak ergodicity breaking  @xcite .",
    "the deeper reason behind this nonstationarity are scale - free characteristics of waiting times . in the context of diffusion dynamics , for instance , this absence of a typical time scale is motivated by an immense heterogeneity of the environment . in effect",
    ", the particle encounters an indefinitely broad range of waiting times and falls into deeper and deeper traps while exploring the environment .",
    "thus , ctrw models are by definition highly nonstationary stochastic processes , and it is indeed natural to extend the common model candidates ( @xmath117 for uncorrelated , stationary jump distances and @xmath125 for uncorrelated , stationary waiting times ) to the larger class of stable , but correlated and potentially nonstationary motions considered here .",
    "for ordinary lvy flights or ctrws , the tail parameters @xmath30 and @xmath53 determine both the distributional and the scaling properties of the process . the present correlated model is slightly more complex in this respect .",
    "while the shape of the pdf depends on all four parameters , only the hurst parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 determine the time scaling . to see this ,",
    "recall that for the lvy stable motions we have the characteristic scalings @xmath171 and @xmath172 . from eqs .",
    "( [ y ] ) and  ( [ t ] ) it follows that @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "consequently , the internal time scales as @xmath175 , and for the correlated motion we get @xmath176 we therefore call @xmath2 the scaling or hurst exponent of the correlated motion @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , from the point of view of time scaling , persistence in waiting times competes with persistence in jump distances , and the process can turn out to be either sub- ( @xmath177 ) , or superdiffusive ( @xmath178 ) , or exhibit a normal diffusive scaling ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "conversely , measuring the hurst exponent @xmath2 alone does not reveal specific information on the time scaling of correlated waiting times ( @xmath135 ) and correlated jumps ( @xmath134 ) , but only on their ratio .",
    "this ambiguity actually goes beyond a simple time scaling analysis and extends to the analysis of the pdf , as we show now .",
    "let @xmath127 denote the probability density for the internal time @xmath69 at given laboratory time @xmath8 . recall that @xmath124 is a monotonically increasing process .",
    "this implies @xcite @xmath179 for any fixed laboratory time @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , @xmath180 we can now combine eqs .",
    "( [ y ] ) , ( [ s ] ) and ( [ invstable ] ) to write the pdf @xmath181 for the correlated ctrw @xmath67 at time @xmath8 in terms of stable densities , @xmath182 this representation demonstrates that the qualitative shape of the pdf can be classified in terms of only three parameters : the tail parameters @xmath30 and @xmath53 and the scaling exponent @xmath183 .",
    "this means that two processes may seemingly be the same when only studying their pdf and time scaling behaviour , although they are inherently different with respect to their correlations .",
    "apparently , persistence in jump distances can balance persistence in waiting times , similar to the previously observed twin paradox @xcite .",
    "consider , for instance , the stochastic process @xmath1 defined by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "<S> standard continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) models are renewal processes in the sense that at each jump a new , independent pair of jump length and waiting time are chosen . </S>",
    "<S> globally , anomalous diffusion emerges through action of the generalized central limit theorem leading to scale - free forms of the jump length or waiting time distributions . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a modified version of recently proposed correlated ctrw processes , where we incorporate a power - law correlated noise on the level of both jump length and waiting time dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a very general stochastic model , that encompasses key features of several paradigmatic models of anomalous diffusion : discontinuous , scale - free displacements as in lvy flights , scale - free waiting times as in subdiffusive ctrws , and the long - range temporal correlations of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the exact solutions for the single - time probability density functions and extract the scaling behaviours . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that different combinations of the model parameters lead to indistinguishable shapes of the emerging probability density functions and identical scaling laws . </S>",
    "<S> our model will be useful to describe recent experimental single particle tracking data , that feature a combination of ctrw and fbm properties . </S>"
