    "the internal structure of a white dwarf star contains a detailed record of the physical processes that operate during post - main - sequence evolution .",
    "the composition of the deep interior is determined by the nuclear reaction rates during core helium burning in the red giant progenitor , while the chemical profile in the outer core is set by helium shell burning and various mixing processes including convective overshoot .",
    "more than 99% of the mass in a typical white dwarf is contained in the c / o core , which is embedded in an envelope of c , he , and h with traces of heavier elements . near the end of post - agb evolution",
    "the white dwarf envelope can become uniformly mixed during a very late thermal pulse , which burns off most of the residual h and creates a born - again agb star @xcite . as this newly formed h - deficient star begins to descend the white dwarf cooling track , the high surface gravity ( @xmath0 ) coupled with chemical and thermal diffusion leads to compositional stratification .",
    "the lighter elements float to the surface , slowly building a nearly pure surface he layer above the remainder of the envelope as the star cools .",
    "asteroseismology is the only observational method available to probe the interior structure of white dwarfs and calibrate theories of nuclear burning , mixing , and diffusion in these stars .",
    "the helium - atmosphere ( db ) white dwarfs are particularly suitable for asteroseismic study , since they are observed to pulsate in a range of effective temperatures between 22,400 and 28,400  k @xcite .",
    "the mass of the pure he surface layer is predicted to grow by roughly an order of magnitude within this range , so an asteroseismic calibration of diffusion theory is possible by studying db variables ( dbvs ) at various temperatures @xcite . unlike the hotter class of variable white dwarfs ( the pg  1159 stars ) dbvs do not experience significant gravitational contraction , which simplifies the asteroseismic analysis since the mechanical and thermal structure are decoupled @xcite . the cooler hydrogen - atmosphere variables ( davs )",
    "also enjoy this advantage , but their cores are significantly more degenerate  reducing the influence of the deep interior structure on their pulsation periods .    despite their extraordinary potential ,",
    "only two dbv white dwarfs have been sufficiently characterized to allow detailed asteroseismic study .",
    "the brightest member of the class , gd  358 , has been the target of three multi - site observing campaigns of the whole earth telescope ( wet ; * ? ? ?",

    "these data revealed a series of 11 dipole modes ( @xmath1=1 ,  @xmath2=0 ; * ? ? ? * ) of consecutive radial overtone ( @xmath3=8 - 18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that could be used for model - fitting .",
    "prior to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the faintest member of the class was cbs  114 , which was first subjected to detailed study by @xcite .",
    "a recent dual - site campaign on this star by @xcite documented a total of 11 dipole modes with radial overtones ranging from @xmath3=8 to @xmath3=20 .    in the following section",
    ", i review the recent development of detailed structural models for dbv white dwarfs with an emphasis on the published models for gd  358 over the past five years .",
    "i then present a series of new model - fits to the latest observations of cbs  114 in section  [ sec3 ] to illustrate the relative importance of the various interior structures expected from stellar evolution theory .",
    "the final fit in this series represents the first successful application of a model containing a complete , physically motivated description of the white dwarf interior . finally in section  [ sec4 ] , i discuss the implications of this result for theories of diffusion and nuclear burning , and i evaluate the prospects for future progress .",
    "although detailed observations of the dbv white dwarf gd  358 have been available since 1994 , the realization of their full potential had to wait for the large - scale exploration of models made possible by fast , inexpensive computers .",
    "the original analysis by @xcite attempted to match the observed pulsation periods using a small grid of models around an initial guess based on general scaling arguments and analytical relations developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the main physical parameters that were adjusted to fit the models to the data included the stellar mass ( @xmath4 ) , the effective temperature ( @xmath5 ) , the mass of the surface he layer ( @xmath6 ) , and several fixed core profiles including uniform and variable c / o mixtures .",
    "the best - fit model from this analysis matched the observed periods with a precision of @xmath7  s , but had a surface he layer ( @xmath8 ) that was thinner than expected from stellar evolution theory ( @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this pioneering work guided the development of a new model - fitting method based on a parallel genetic algorithm @xcite running on a 64-node commodity - hardware linux cluster @xcite .",
    "using essentially the same models as @xcite , @xcite had the genetic algorithm explore a much broader range of the three main parameters ( @xmath10 ) with a similar set of fixed core profiles .",
    "this innovative search revealed a second family of solutions with the expected thick surface he layers , outside of the range considered by the original study , which provided a considerably better match to the observations ( @xmath11  s ) .",
    "the results also demonstrated that the models were much more sensitive to the core composition than was previously believed .",
    "the conventional wisdom held that @xmath12-mode pulsations in white dwarf stars were primarily envelope modes .",
    "while it is true that the horizontal displacements in the envelope from the non - radial oscillations are so large that they make the motions in the core almost invisible , the inner 90% of the mass actually contains the first several nodes of the radial eigenfunction for the pulsations observed in dbv stars .    motivated by this newly - discovered sensitivity to the core composition",
    ", @xcite extended the genetic algorithm fitting method to optimize two additional parameters describing a generic c / o profile .",
    "the adjustable central oxygen mass fraction ( @xmath13 ) was fixed to a constant value out to some fractional mass ( @xmath14 ) where it then decreased linearly in mass to zero oxygen at 0.95  @xmath15 .",
    "the optimization of these five parameters led to a model that matched the observations with a precision of @xmath16  s , representing a substantial improvement over the best strictly 3-parameter model ( @xmath17  s ) . from this first asteroseismic measurement of @xmath13",
    ", @xcite attempted to constrain the rate of the astrophysically important @xmath18 nuclear reaction , extrapolating from the published chemical profiles of @xcite .",
    "a follow - up study by @xcite quantified many possible sources of systematic error in this measurement , but failed to identify any that were substantially larger than the statistical errors .",
    "however , persistent disagreement between the derived values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 and the spectroscopic estimates suggested room for improvement in the model .",
    "@xcite disputed the results of @xcite , arguing that the model envelopes should include a double - layered structure .",
    "if we assume that dbv white dwarfs are the evolutionary descendants of the hotter pg  1159 stars , then the surface he layer should be only @xmath19 , situated above the still - uniform envelope ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this could explain the two families of solutions for @xmath21 found by @xcite when assuming a single - layered structure . to illustrate the potential of double - layered envelope models",
    ", @xcite attempted to match the pulsation periods of gd  358 with a targeted grid .",
    "using several uniform core compositions , they adjusted four parameters ( @xmath22 ) and found a best - fit model with @xmath23  s. this suggested that double - layered envelope models with no structure in the core could explain the observations of gd  358 nearly as well as the single - layered models of @xcite which had an adjustable c / o profile in the core .    around the same time ,",
    "@xcite identified two large sources of systematic error in the determination of @xmath13 .",
    "previous fitting had attempted to match not only the periods , but also the forward period spacing ( @xmath24 ) simultaneously .",
    "ironically , this was intended to minimize the impact of systematic errors on the calculated periods , but it biased the determinations of @xmath13 to be higher . a second bias in the same direction came from fixing the mixing - length / pressure scale height ratio too high , leading to overly efficient convection that modified the thermal structure of the models . by matching only the periods and using the ml2/@xmath25=1.25 prescription for convection @xcite ,",
    "the 5-parameter single - layered envelope fit for gd  358 improved to @xmath26  s and the derived value of @xmath13 suggested a @xmath27 rate that was consistent with laboratory measurements @xcite .",
    "it finally became clear that neither of these models represented an adequate description of the white dwarf structure when @xcite identified an inherent symmetry in the way the pulsations sample the interior of dbv models .",
    "they found that generic perturbations caused by structure at specific locations in the core could not be distinguished from structure at corresponding locations in the envelope .",
    "this core - envelope symmetry could produce confusion between a c / o gradient near @xmath28 from prior nuclear burning , and the base of the surface he layer in the outer @xmath29 from diffusion .",
    "however , by using realistic internal chemical profiles in both regions of the models , they determined the relative importance of the structures expected at various locations .",
    "this led them to conclude that the deep interior core structure should leave the largest imprint on the observed periods , while the base of the surface he layer was expected to have the smallest influence .",
    "the total envelope mass was less important than the core structure , but had a larger effect than the outermost layer .    to investigate whether the structure in the core and envelope could be measured simultaneously , @xcite modified their models to include a parameterization of the double - layered envelopes used by @xcite .",
    "they performed 4-parameter fits comparable to those of @xcite , as well as 6-parameter fits that also included an adjustable c / o profile .",
    "although the addition of core structure led to a significant improvement , neither fit reached the level of precision attained by using single - layered envelope models , and the disagreement with the spectroscopic estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath4 became even worse . however , by fitting the periods of the model from @xcite , @xcite discovered a systematic offset in the temperature scales that could be attributed to the different radiative opacities used in the two models @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     confronted with so many fitting results for one set of observations ",
    "some of them from models with very different interior structures  a casual observer might lose all confidence in our ability to do asteroseismology .",
    "ultimately this is a symptom of the fact that we are confined to forward modeling : we adopt a structural model and see how closely it can match the observations .",
    "we can inform this choice with theoretical expectations , but we will always find an optimal model  even when the model is incomplete .",
    "the results from an incomplete model are not meaningless ; they provide clues that help us identify the missing ingredients .",
    "the two families of solutions for the surface he layer in single - layered models told us that the real star showed evidence of composition transition zones at two locations in the envelope .",
    "the systematic differences between the derived masses and effective temperatures compared to spectroscopic estimates hinted that we needed to update the constitutive physics .",
    "how closely we can match the observations with each of the incomplete models gives us insight about which structural ingredients are the most important .",
    "recent observations of cbs  114 by @xcite finally give us an opportunity to evaluate the models reliably on a second dbv white dwarf .",
    "if we fit these new data using each of the models that have previously been applied to gd  358but keeping the model physics fixed  we can isolate the impact of various interior structures on the quality of the match to the observations",
    ". this exercise may be easier for cbs  114 since the intrinsic core - envelope symmetry will affect slightly different regions of the model , so we might have less difficulty distinguishing the signatures of the surface he layer and the deep c / o profile .",
    "it should also give us a clearer understanding of what is actually being measured by each of the structurally incomplete models , and how the other parameters are affected by the incompleteness .",
    "all of the modeling discussed below was performed with the wd-40 code originally described by @xcite , with several important updates to the constitutive physics .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) for the cores and the envelopes come from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "to describe the composition transition zones in the envelope , we use an adaptation of the method of @xcite for single - layered models , or a parameterization of the time - dependent diffusion results of @xcite for double - layered models , as described by @xcite .",
    "the c / o profiles in the core are set either by the generic parameterization developed by @xcite , or by a new version that uses an adjustable profile based on the calculations of @xcite .",
    "the models use the updated opal opacity tables @xcite , neutrino rates from @xcite , and the mixing - length prescription of @xcite with ml2/@xmath25=1.25 convective efficiency as suggested by @xcite .    the new set of optimal models for cbs  114",
    "are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . in each case , a model - fitting method based on a parallel genetic algorithm was used to search a broad range for each parameter and optimize the match between the observed and calculated periods @xcite . the search range for each parameter and the details of the model - fitting procedure",
    "have been described by @xcite for @xmath30 , @xcite for @xmath31 , and @xcite for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    beyond the basic stellar parameters ( @xmath34 ) , the simplest of the models ( @xmath30 ) includes an adjustable mass for a single surface layer situated above a pure c core .",
    "the derived value of @xmath5 falls comfortably within the range determined from spectroscopy ( @xmath35 - 26,200  k , @xmath36 - 8.00 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the derived mass ( @xmath37 ) is significantly above the spectroscopic estimate . despite the many simplifications inherent in this model , the derived envelope mass is in the range expected from stellar evolution theory @xcite . as with gd  358 ,",

    "models that produce residuals within 1@xmath38 ( red ) , 3@xmath38 ( yellow ) , 10@xmath38 ( green ) , 25@xmath38 ( cyan ) , and 40@xmath38 ( blue ) of the optimum are shown.[fig1 ] ]    the optimal parameters for the double - layered envelope model ( @xmath32 ) include values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 that are both consistent with the spectroscopic estimates , but the slight improvement to the fit is not significant . according to the bayes information criterion ( bic ;",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the addition of one adjustable parameter to the fit should reduce the residuals from @xmath39  s for @xmath30 to @xmath40  s for @xmath32 .",
    "the actual fit yields @xmath41  s for @xmath32 , which is statistically worse than the single - layered fit . in the absence of core structure ,",
    "single - layered envelope models provide a statistically better match to the observations of cbs  114 than double - layered envelope models .",
    "similar results were obtained for gd  358 , where the double - layered fit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath42  s ) was also statistically worse than the single - layered fit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath17  s ) for pure c cores .",
    "even so , the derived values of @xmath43 and @xmath21 from both stars qualitatively agree with the expectations of diffusion theory @xcite , suggesting that the double - layered fits might be measuring real structure even if the models are incomplete .",
    "by contrast , the addition of an adjustable c / o profile to single - layered models ( @xmath31 ) leads to a dramatic improvement in the residuals .",
    "the bic leads us to expect a reduction from @xmath39  s to @xmath44  s , just from the addition of two adjustable parameters .",
    "in fact , the single - layered fit with a c / o core improves the fit to @xmath45  s , a statistically significant reduction .",
    "however , the derived values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 do not agree nearly as well with spectroscopic estimates , and the value of @xmath13 is difficult to reconcile with the expectations from prior nuclear burning .",
    "again , similar results were found for gd  358 by @xcite . despite these systematic errors , the derived values for @xmath43 from the two single - layered",
    "fits agree with each other , suggesting that thick envelopes are a qualitatively robust structural feature of the results .    for models that contain an adjustable c / o profile in the core , the inclusion of double - layered envelopes ( @xmath33 ) produces a significant improvement in the residuals , and restores the agreement with spectroscopic estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "the residuals from the @xmath31 fit should decrease from @xmath45  s to @xmath46  s from the addition of one adjustable parameter , but the @xmath33 fit with a generic c / o profile actually decreases the residuals to @xmath47  s. this statistically significant improvement is accompanied by derived values of @xmath43 and @xmath21 that once again qualitatively agree with diffusion theory .",
    "the only remaining concern with this model is the implausibly large derived value of @xmath48",
    ".    this may not be too surprising , considering the simplistic form of the generic c / o profile compared to chemical profiles generated by realistic stellar evolution calculations . although a constant value of @xmath13 out to some fractional mass ( @xmath14 ) is a generic feature of such simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "2 ) , the o profile in the outer core is expected to be more complicated than a linear decrease . for example",
    ", the models of @xcite show an initially sharp drop in the o mass fraction near the edge of the progenitor s convective core , surrounded by a more gradual decline produced during he shell burning , followed by an abrupt drop where the temperature and pressure in the progenitor were no longer sufficient to sustain shell burning .",
    "a new implementation of the adjustable c / o profiles continues to keep @xmath13 constant out to some fractional mass @xmath14 , but then falls to zero oxygen at 0.95  @xmath15 with a more physically motivated shape . for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "the profile closely resembles the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "3 ) , and for any other values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 the profile is scaled to maintain a similar shape between @xmath14 and 0.95  @xmath15 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] )",
    ".     fits to cbs  114 .",
    "the plotted values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the final entry in table  [ tab1].[fig2 ] ]    by incorporating these physically motivated c / o profiles into double - layered envelope models , the optimal parameters for cbs  114 lead to an interior structure that agrees with both diffusion theory and the expected nuclear burning history . without adding any adjustable parameters , this modification to the c / o profile in the outer core reduces the residuals from @xmath47  s to @xmath51  s , an improvement comparable to what would be expected from 1.5 additional free parameters .",
    "the derived values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 are in reasonable agreement with spectroscopic estimates , the structure of the envelope is approximately as expected from diffusion theory , and the core c / o profile implies a rate for the @xmath52 reaction that agrees with recent laboratory measurements",
    ". we should ultimately be able to refine theories of diffusion and nuclear burning to accommodate these new observational constraints .",
    "the past five years have seen unprecedented progress in the development of white dwarf interior structure models , and in our ability to fit them to the available observations .",
    "this rapid improvement in our understanding has been most evident for the dbv white dwarfs , where the physical conditions are ripe for asteroseismic investigation .",
    "our models for these stars have evolved from a simple parameterization of a single surface he layer above a pure c core to the double - layered envelope structure expected from diffusion calculations surrounding a physically motivated c / o profile in the core .",
    "we have finally been able to demonstrate that these structural ingredients , when taken together , lead to significant improvements in our ability to match the observations of cbs  114 .",
    "it is now clear that the detailed core c / o profile is the most important feature for quantitative asteroseismology of dbv white dwarfs .",
    "the most dramatic improvements in our ability to match the observations came from the addition of c / o cores , even when using relatively crude approximations for the structure in the envelope .",
    "the generic c / o profiles developed by @xcite seemed to reproduce the most important asteroseismic features , but the physically motivated profiles introduced here appear to be necessary for a reliable determination of the composition deep in the core . disentangling the roles of the @xmath52 reaction and mixing processes such as convective overshoot should be possible using the derived value of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "new simulations of white dwarf interior chemical profiles that attempt to match the asteroseismic c / o profile will help to calibrate these processes .    without a c / o profile , the double - layered envelope structure expected from diffusion actually diminishes the ability of the models to match the observations , compared to simpler envelopes .",
    "we can now understand this to be a natural outcome of the relative importance of various regions of the interior : c / o profiles leave the largest imprint on the pulsation periods , followed by the base of the envelope ( @xmath43 ) and the surface layer ( @xmath21 ) . in the absence of core structure , models that maximize the imprint of @xmath43",
    "provide better fits .",
    "since double - layered models effectively split the he transition zone between two separate locations in the envelope , the imprint of @xmath43 is reduced relative to single - layered models . with the c / o core",
    "included , the fine tuning made possible by the double - layered models produces a significant improvement and leads to a credible envelope structure .",
    "future time - dependent diffusion calculations should attempt to reproduce these asteroseismic measurements .",
    "we can instill greater confidence is these results by applying our physically motivated structural models to additional white dwarf stars . imposing the requirement that our model must be able to explain two independent sets of observations  from stars operating under slightly different physical conditions  is a very powerful constraint .",
    "unfortunately , gd  358 may not be the best choice for such an experiment because the intrinsic core - envelope symmetry in this case appears to create an intractable ambiguity between the locations of the surface he layer and the core c / o profile , even when using physically motivated shapes for the chemical transitions .",
    "a better candidate might be found among dbv stars that are hotter than cbs  114 ( e.g. ec  20058@xmath535234 ) or cooler than gd  358 ( e.g. pg  1456@xmath54103 ) .",
    "many new dbv stars have recently been identified in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , but most of them are considerably fainter than the previously known sample .",
    "extensive follow - up observations to identify the most promising multi - mode pulsators will require 2-m class telescopes equipped with time - series optimized frame - transfer ccd cameras @xcite . with the computational tools in place , we should quickly be able to refine our understanding of the forces that shape white dwarf interiors .",
    "i would like to thank mike montgomery , steve kawaler , and don winget for helping me decode the clues that led us to improve our models over time .",
