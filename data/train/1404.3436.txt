    "neutrino interactions with plasma are very important to understand supernova explosions and many other astrophysical phenomena @xcite",
    ". two types of effects arise from such interactions .",
    "first , they modify the neutrino flavor oscillations @xcite , and introduce a resonant coupling between different flavor states , known as the msw ( mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ) effect @xcite .",
    "second , they create an induced neutrino charge @xcite , which can lead to collective plasma oscillations and significantly increase the collision cross sections . the energy transfer between a neutrino beam and plasma wave",
    "is mediated by the neutrino landau damping @xcite .",
    "the individual flavor processes are important to understand the solar neutrino deficit , while the collective plasma effects could play a major role in supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the core - collapse problem is still unsolved @xcite . a possible solution could eventually be given by these plasma effects .    in a recent work ,",
    "we have proposed to built a bridge between these two kinds of phenomena , and have introduced plasma physics methods in the discussion of neutrino flavor oscillations in matter . in particular , we have derived exact bgk ( bernstein - greene - kruskal ) like solutions for electron plasma density profiles compatible with given neutrino flavor parameters @xcite , and have determined the modified neutrino flavor oscillations in the presence of plasma waves and turbulence @xcite . here , we take a further step in the same direction , by considering the mutual influence of flavor oscillations and plasma instabilities . we will show that the neutrino flavor parameters are not only perturbed by electron plasmas oscillations , but can also contribute to both the dispersion relation and the growth rates of neutrino beam instabilities in a plasma .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii , we consider the basic equations of our problem , by considering a simple fluid description where ions are assumed at rest and the neutrino flavor oscillations are taken into account . in section iii , we consider a plasma in steady state , and characterize the unperturbed solutions for both the electron plasma parameters and the flavor polarization vector . in section iv , we consider the perturbations induced by a plasma wave and establish the evolution equations for the perturbed quantities . from this perturbative analysis",
    "it becomes clear that plasma waves induce perturbation in the neutrino flavor parameters which , on the other hand , lead to new dispersive effects . in section",
    "v , we consider the case of electron plasma waves excited by an incoherent neutrino beam , and determine the corresponding growth rates . in section",
    "vi we generalize this analysis to the case of a coherent neutrino beam and show that the flavor oscillations can contribute to the dispersion relation of electron plasma waves .",
    "finally , in section vii , we state some conclusions .",
    "we assume a simple fluid description for both the plasma electrons and the neutrino beam , with immobile ions . a unit system with @xmath0 will be used .",
    "the electrons are described by the non - relativistic fluid equations fluid equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron mean density and velocity , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the electron pressure .",
    "we have also used the lorentz force @xmath6 , and the neutrino force @xmath7 , defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath11 is the electron charge , @xmath12 the fermi constant of weak interactions , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are effective fields induced by the weak interactions , determined by @xmath15 the electron - neutrino density @xmath16 , and current @xmath17 , are coupled to the muon neutrino density @xmath18 and current @xmath19 , as shown by the continuity equations @xmath20 where the quantity @xmath21 pertains to neutrino coherence , as clarified below . here ,",
    "for simplicity , we restrict our analysis to the familiar two - flavor model @xcite , but extension to the three neutrino flavor states would not be difficult .",
    "in these two coupled equations we have also used the constants @xmath22 strictly speaking , eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) only apply to a coherent neutrino beam with a defined energy @xmath23 , and can not be used in arbitrary situations . for this reason",
    ", we will only restrict our discussion to the neutrino beam interaction with a plasma , where the frequency @xmath24 can be unequivocally defined as @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the neutrino square mass difference .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum coherence factor @xmath21 satisfies the relations @xmath27 where we have defined @xmath28 the meaning of the total time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) will be clarified in section iii . to complete the description of the neutrino populations",
    ", we should consider the neutrino momentum equations @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 appearing in these equations are effective fields @xcite defined as @xmath34 the quantity @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) depends on the energy of the neutrino beam , and is well defined for a ( nearly mono - energetic ) beam , such that @xmath36 .",
    "the momentum equations in ( [ 2.8 ] ) show that , in the presence of plasma perturbations @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not necessarily identical .    in conclusion , we have a rather detailed model for the neutrino - plasma coupling .",
    "the electron variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 are determined in a self - consistent way together with the fields @xmath41 through the maxwell equations with self - consistent charge and current density , with a coupling produced by the neutrino force @xmath7 in the electron momentum equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "the neutrino force depends on the effective neutrino fields @xmath42 , which in turn are specified by the electron neutrino variables @xmath43 .",
    "however , in the present two - flavor model , the electron neutrino variables oscillate due to the quantum coherence @xmath21 , coupling with the muon neutrino quantities @xmath44 .",
    "finally , the neutrino oscillations are influenced by the plasma in two ways : due to the coupling with @xmath2 in @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) and due to the role of the electromagnetic field in the electron neutrino momentum equation ( [ 2.8 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "illustrative examples of applications are provided .",
    "for simplicity , let us consider a non - magnetized plasma , although e.g. regarding a supernovae setting future works accounting for a non - zero ambient magnetic field could be quite relevant . in equilibrium , we have @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that , for a mono - energetic neutrino beam , the velocity of both flavors are identical , and we can use @xmath49 . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) will reduce to the following relation @xmath50 with @xmath51 . in this case",

    "they can be rewritten as @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that @xmath55 introducing a new angle @xmath56 , we can also write @xmath57 equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) can be solved as @xmath58 it is convenient to define the constants of integration as @xmath59 , in terms of a free parameter @xmath60 related to quantum coherence , leading to @xmath61 accordingly , without loss of generality a phase constant was chosen so that @xmath62 . for completeness",

    "we can explicitly see that @xmath60 is a measure of the amplitude of the flavor oscillations , for if @xmath67 there are no oscillations at all .",

    "nothing that eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) contain total derivatives ( in a lagrangian variables sense ) , we can also consider another class of initial conditions , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting solutions would then be expressed in terms of spatial coordinates as @xmath75 where @xmath76 . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on equilibrium solutions of the type ( [ 3.5 ] ) , although a similar analysis could be done for solutions of the type ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "in the previous section there was no electromagnetic field at all .",
    "we now consider the possible excitation of electron plasma waves by a mono - energetic neutrino beam , as described by the perturbed densities @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we restrict our discussion to electrostatic waves , with @xmath80 and @xmath9 determined by poisson s equation @xmath81 linearizing the electron fluid eqs .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) , with @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 in addition , the displacement current contribution from ( [ 2.3 ] ) has been disregarded due to the non - relativistic assumption . taking the time derivative of the continuity equation and using ( [ 4.1 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath84 where we have used the electron plasma frequency @xmath85 , and the electron thermal velocity @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the electron temperature . in this expression",
    ", we can easily recognize the usual wave equation for electron density perturbations , with an additional term associated with the electron - neutrino oscillations .    in order to determine the quantity @xmath88 , we linearize eqs .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) - ( [ 2.7 ] ) , assuming that the unperturbed neutrino flavor solutions @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given by the ( homogeneous in space ) solutions of section iii .",
    "this leads to @xmath92 complemented by the neutrino momentum equations @xmath93 in these expressions we have used the total time derivative @xmath94 .",
    "we can immediately recognize that the muon - neutrinos are not accelerated by the electron plasma wave , because they are not directly coupled to the electron perturbations .",
    "this is strictly valid only for a neutral electron - proton plasma .",
    "we should also note that @xmath95,where @xmath23 is the unperturbed neutrino beam energy . from here , we can derive an evolution equation for the perturbed electron - neutrino density , of the form @xmath96 with @xmath97 it can be seen that the evolution of the perturbed density @xmath88 is coupled to @xmath98 , and also depends on the perturbed coherence @xmath99 . an equation for this quantity",
    "can be derived from eq .",

    "we now have all the equations for the perturbed quantities , which will be solved in the next two sections .",
    "let us first consider the simple case of @xmath105 and @xmath67 , which corresponds to the absence of quantum coherence . in this case , we have two coupled equations for the variables @xmath88 and @xmath98 . on the other hand , no flavor oscillations will occur , and @xmath106 .",
    "we therefore take @xmath107 . for perturbations evolving as @xmath108 , we can reduce eqs .",

    "maximum growth rates occur for the double resonance condition @xmath115 , where we have assumed @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding growth rate for the unstable solution is @xmath117 valid for @xmath118 and high frequency waves such hat @xmath119 . in the growth rate expression ,",
    "the free parameters are @xmath120 ( the initial electron neutrino population ) , @xmath23 ( the defined coherent neutrino beam energy ) and the neutrino beam velocity @xmath121 as well as the equilibrium electron density .",
    "finally , it should be observed that eq .",
    "( [ 5.3 ] ) is valid for @xmath122 : it can easily be shown from eq .",
    "( [ 5.1b ] ) that there is no instability if @xmath123 , as expected .",
    "hence , the above growth rate estimate is always defined for the relevant scenarios . also observe the growth rate is @xmath124 which is the same estimate as in @xcite for a weak neutrino beam .",
    "revealing insights can be obtained rewriting the dispersion relation in terms of a characteristic function @xmath125 as @xmath126 the dispersion relation is a fourth degree equation for @xmath127 .",
    "hence , to admit complex conjugate solutions and hence an unstable mode , the local minimum at @xmath128 ( see figure 1 ) should satisfy @xmath129 . to",
    "leading order in the neutrino coupling effects , we find @xmath130 together with the instability condition @xmath131 where @xmath132 was also assumed .",
    "notice that the instability is enhanced by larger neutrino effects as apparent from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) .",
    "moreover if the double resonance condition is fulfilled the instability condition is also immediately satisfied since the neutrino term is always positive ( never stabilizing ) .    ) , in a generic unstable case such that @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the local minimum .",
    "there are only two real roots for the dispersion relation equation . on the right : the same but for a generic stable case such that @xmath135 and four real roots for the dispersion relation.,width=576,height=249 ]",

    "( [ 6.5 ] ) , by noting that the differences between @xmath149 and @xmath150 are very small , if we assume that @xmath151 .",
    "( [ 6.4a ] ) , we obtain by differentiation , @xmath152 .",
    "this leads to @xmath153 now , using @xmath154 , and noting that @xmath155 , we finally arrive at the simple estimate @xmath156 taking @xmath157 , this leads to the following dispersion relation @xmath158 this result shows that the previous dispersion relation ( [ 5.2 ] ) for the neutrino beam interactions is corrected by an additional factor due to quantum correlations , which is of the order of @xmath159 .",
    "such corrections result from the coupling between quantum flavor oscillations and electron plasma waves , or in other words , between the quantum properties of neutrinos and their collective interactions with the plasma .",
    "another interesting case , would be that of a near resonance between plasma and flavor oscillations , such that @xmath160 , where stronger effects can be expected .",
    "we have studied the influence the neutrino flavor oscillations on electron plasma waves created by neutrino beams , or in other words , the influence of the neutrino quantum properties on their collective behavior .",
    "the flavor oscillations result from the difference between the neutrino mass states and their interaction states .",
    "on the other hand , the neutrino beam instabilities result form their weak coupling with the plasma .",
    "we have shown that the existence of flavor oscillations gives a new contribution to plasma dispersion relation , thus changing the frequency and growth rates of the beam instabilities .    in our model",
    ", we have introduced a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we have only retained the charged weak current and ignored the contributions from the neutral weak current .",
    "it is known that the electron neutrinos are coupled by the charged bosons @xmath161 to the electrons , and all neutrino flavors are coupled by the neutral boson @xmath162 with both electrons and protons . for a plasma of electrons and protons in equilibrium , this weak coupling would give no net contribution to the neutrino - plasma interactions .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of a perturbation , this would lead to a correcting factor of order one to the terms proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , our work was only focused on electron plasma oscillations , and the protons ( or ions ) were assumed immobile .",
    "but we could also consider the excitation of ion acoustic waves , with frequencies of the order of the flavor oscillation frequency .",
    "these excitation could be driven by flavor oscillations .",
    "we should notice that the collective ion - neutrino coupling is mediated by the electrons , which can be assumed in boltzmann equilibrium in the electrostatic and weak field potentials .",
    "an electronic density @xmath164 m@xmath165 @xcite yields a plasma frequency @xmath166 s@xmath167 .",
    "considering also @xmath168 m@xmath165 , @xmath169 mev , @xmath170 and with @xmath171 j.m@xmath172 , one finds a growth rate , @xmath173 which is far shorter than the time scale ( @xmath174 second ) of the explosion .",
    "this instability definitely appears fast enough to alter neutrino mixing in core - collapse supernova .",
    "the present results show that electron plasma waves excited by intense neutrino beams are intimately linked with the quantum processes associated with flavor oscillations .",
    "the dispersion relation and growth rates of these plasma instabilities are directly influenced by these flavor oscillations .",
    "it should however be noticed that we have also restricted our analysis to nearly mono - energetic neutrino beams .",
    "the general case of an arbitrary neutrino population can only be treated in the frame of a quantum statistical approach , which will be considered in a future publication ."
