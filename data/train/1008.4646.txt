    "cosmic rays ( crs ) are energetic particles originating from outer space that impinge on earth s atmosphere .",
    "almost @xmath2 of all the incoming cosmic ray particles are protons , about @xmath3 are helium nuclei ( alpha particles ) , and slightly under @xmath4 are heavier elements and electrons@xcite . the history of the cr studies may be rooted in 1901 when two groups came to the same conclusion that pure air in a closed vessel possessed some electrical conductivity@xcite , while no visible sources of air ionization were observed . at that time it was already known that x - rays and radioactivity were factors contributing to the enhanced electrical conductivity of gases .",
    "therefore , the observed effect of  dark current \" caused by residual ionization of the air , was then regarded as being associated with radioactive contamination both in the air and in the environment@xcite .",
    "wilson speculated that the residual ionization was due to certain highly penetrating radiation coming from outside the earth s atmosphere@xcite .",
    "such a speculation was convincingly confirmed by hess@xcite and kolhorster@xcite about 10 years later .",
    "august 7 , 1912 , the date of hess most successful balloon flight among the total of ten , is generally regarded as the date of the discovery of cosmic rays .",
    "the discovery of cosmic rays opens a new window not only for high energy astrophysics but also for high energy physics .",
    "this is because prior to the constructions of modern particle accelerators , high energy particles could only be observed in cosmic rays . between 1932 and 1953",
    ", many new particles , including positrons , @xmath5-leptons , @xmath6-mesons , @xmath7 and @xmath8mesons , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11hyperons , were all discovered in use of cosmic rays ( ref . and the references therein ) .",
    "a thorough review of crs can be found in many excellent articles and books@xcite , and is beyond the scope of this review . here",
    "we will focus on a small fraction of these high energy particles , the electron / positron ( @xmath12 ) crs . although crs had been discovered in 1912 , cr electrons reaching the earth at energies above a few hundred mev had not been convincingly identified until 1961@xcite .",
    "the first positron - to - electron ratio in crs up to an energy @xmath13 gev was later reported in 1964@xcite .",
    "most cr electrons are likely from the supernova remnants while the cr positrons are mainly produced through hadronic processes when cr protons collide with intergalactic hydrogen .",
    "in such a scenario there should be no prominent feature in the tev energies in the electron / positron total spectrum , and the positron - to - electron ratio @xmath14 should drop with energy monotonously@xcite .",
    "a rise of the positron - to - electron ratio above @xmath15 gev was observed in 1974@xcite at @xmath16 gev , implying an excess of positron crs@xcite .",
    "it was however only based on a total of 13 events and therefore highly uncertain @xcite . if one plots the single data of ref .",
    "( at @xmath15 gev ) published in 1969 together with some other data at lower energies reported before , one would also get a positron excess@xcite . ] .",
    "such a tendency was confirmed by several balloon flights , including the 1976 flight by the new mexico state university group launched from palestine , texa in 1976@xcite , and 1984 flight by the university of chicago group launched from hawaii@xcite , and in particular , by the recent pamela mission@xcite ( see section [ sec : observation ] for extensive discussion ) . in 1987",
    "it was already clear that the rising behavior of @xmath17 above @xmath15 gev is not predicted by calculations of cr propagation@xcite and may imply an excess of cr positrons .",
    "recently , atic@xcite , ppb - bets@xcite and fermi - lat@xcite reported electron / positron total spectrum up to tev and found a hardening / bump in the energy range from 100 gev to 1 tev . in the conventional approach ,",
    "the injection spectrum of the electrons ( positrons ) is taken as a single power - law . since diffusion and electron / positron cooling",
    "are more efficient in higher energies , one would expect that the spectrum should soften with energy .",
    "therefore the unexpected spectrum hardening observed by these detectors strongly suggest another excess ( besides the positron fraction excess ) .",
    "interestingly this total @xmath1 excess is consistent with extrapolating the positron fraction excess to high energies .",
    "these interesting features draw a lot of attention , and various physical origins have been explored . in the literature , new astrophysical sources or even new physics ( dark matter ) are widely suggested .",
    "some more conservative authors argue that the excesses are simply due to inadequate accounts on the electron / positron cr background in previous modeling .",
    "the situation is unclear .",
    "several reviews appeared recently but are mainly focused on dark matter models @xcite . in this review",
    "we plan to present a more complete overview of this interesting observational feature and various physical interpretations .",
    "the structure of this review is as follows .",
    "we first discuss the observational aspects of the @xmath1 excesses in section 2 .",
    "we then review the cosmic ray propagation models and the general cosmic sources of @xmath1 in section 3 . in the next three sections ( 4 - 6 )",
    ", we discuss three proposed physical origins of the observed @xmath1 excess , including the modified supernova remnant ( snr ) models of @xmath1 background , new astrophysical sources , and new physics .",
    "we summarize the strengths / weaknesses of various models in section 7 with a commentary on the prospects .",
    "different from the cr protons / nuclei , the tev electrons / positrons suffer significant energy loss and can not reach us if the source is not nearby ( i.e. , @xmath18 kpc ) .",
    "accurate measurements of the high - energy electron / positron crs then provide a unique opportunity to probe the origin and propagation of crs in the local interstellar medium and to constrain models of the diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "observations of electrons have been notoriously difficult because of their low intensity requiring , in particular at high energies , rather large detectors , and because of the need of effective discrimination against proton - induced background .",
    "so far the high - energy electron spectrum was measured by some balloon - borne experiments ( in addition to those already mentioned in the introduction , some others can be found in refs . ) , some space missions ( including imp-1@xcite , imp - iii@xcite , imp - iv@xcite , imp-7@xcite , ams-01@xcite , pamela@xcite and fermi@xcite ) , and the ground - based cherenkov telescope h.e.s.s.@xcite .",
    "we first briefly review the development of technology used in the experiments . in two of the very early balloon - borne experiments@xcite ,",
    "the cloud chamber technology was employed , which was soon abandoned with the introduction of other more sophisticated detectors , both visible and electronic ( see ref . for a review on the development of technology in the early experiments ) . in the two flights at fort",
    "churchill in 1963@xcite , the spark chamber technique was adopted . with the help of one permanent magnet",
    ", electrons and positrons were distinguished .",
    "such an instrument was later improved@xcite , through replacing the liquid cerenkov detector by a gas cerenkov detector to enable the determination of the momentum and charge of electrons up to @xmath19 gev .",
    "a group from bombay@xcite adopted the nuclear emulsion stack technique , which measures cr electrons to an energy above 50 gev . in order to identify electron showers efficiently",
    ", multiple pulse - height analyses of many counters and time of flight techniques had been used in 3 high - latitude balloon flights from palestine , texas in 1970 by the chicago group@xcite .",
    "later they added a transition radiation detector , consisting of a sandwich of six radiators and six multiwire proportional chambers , to improve electron and positron discrimination@xcite . in a balloon - borne magnetic spectrometer experiment@xcite",
    ", a super - conducting magnetic spectrometer was adopted , and a new bremsstrahlung - identification technique was developed to measure the separate @xmath20 and @xmath21 spectrum in the primary crs from 4 to 50 gev . the emulsion chamber technique was used to detect cr electrons to an energy above 1 tev@xcite . in the experiment of balloon - borne electron telescope with scintillating fibers ( bets ) , the absolute energy spectrum of electrons was measured with a highly granulated fiber calorimeter@xcite .",
    "finally the advanced thin ionization calorimeter ( atic ) experiments used an ionization calorimeter to measure the energy deposited by cascades formed by particles interacting in a thick carbon target @xcite .    since 1950 ,",
    "dozens of balloon - born experiments dedicated to electron / positron cr observations have been carried out .",
    "below we only mention some recent ones that are most relevant to the main topic of this review , the electron / positron excess .    * two early charge determining experiments*.",
    "the chicago group firstly used a permanent magnet to measure the positron - to - electron ratio . in the energy range",
    "@xmath22 gev , the ratio @xmath17 was found to decrease with energy@xcite . adopting a super - conducting magnetic spectrometer , @xmath17",
    "was measured from 5 gev to 50 gev@xcite .",
    "although scatter is large , an tendency of increasing @xmath17 for @xmath23 gev is present .",
    "such a behavior was confirmed by some subsequent groups ( e.g. ref . ) , but not by some others .    * the emulation chamber experiments * by a japanese group started in 1968 . the @xmath24 spectrum derived by combining data from the chambers exposed from 1968 to 1976",
    "was well represented by @xmath25 in the energy range of @xmath26 gev@xcite , which is steeper than the spectrum @xmath27 obtained in the early nuclear emulation stack experiment by the bombay group@xcite .",
    "this confirms some early results , for example , obtained with an ionization calorimeter@xcite .",
    "the observations in 1996 and 1998 extended the @xmath24 spectrum to @xmath28 tev@xcite and might suggest a steepening above 1 tev .    *",
    "high - energy antimatter telescope ( heat ) * is a nasa - supported program of high - altitude balloon - borne experiments to study antimatter in the primary cosmic radiation .",

    "it can measure the cosmic - ray positron fraction from 1 to 50 gev .",
    "a new version of the heat instrument , heat - pbar was designed to observe the high - energy cosmic - ray antiproton flux but it is also suited for the observation of electrons and positrons at energies below 15 gev@xcite . the combined data from the three heat flights indicate a small positron flux of nonstandard origin above 5 gev@xcite .",
    "the evidence for the tendency of increasing @xmath17 for @xmath23 gev is however rather weak , consistent with what was found in the cosmic antiparticle ring imaging cherenkov experiment in 1998@xcite .",
    "* bets and ppb - bets .",
    "* bets represents a detector , the balloon - borne electron telescope with scintillating fibers , which preserves the superior qualities of both electronic detectors and emulsion chambers @xcite .",

    "the energy spectrum is described by a power - law index of @xmath29 , and the absolute differential intensity at 10 gev is @xmath30@xcite .",
    "ppb - bets is an advanced version of bets measuring the electron spectrum up to tev and was flown by polar patrol balloon ( ppb ) in antarctica .",
    "the results from the ppb - bets calorimeter indicates a possible hump in the energy range 100 gev to 1 tev in the total spectrum@xcite , consistent with that reported by atic ( see below ) .    *",
    "the advanced thin ionization calorimeter ( atic ) * is a balloon - borne instrument flying in the stratosphere over antarctica to measure the energy and composition of cosmic rays .",
    "atic was launched from the mcmurdo station for the first time in december 2000 and has since completed three successful flights out of four .",
    "the detector uses the principle of ionization calorimetry : several layers of the scintillator bismuth germanate emit light as they are struck by particles , allowing to calculate the particles energy .",
    "a silicon matrix is used to determine the particles electrical charge@xcite .",
    "the main discovery is a spike - like @xmath24 spectrum feature in the energy range of @xmath31 gev@xcite .",
    "the series of interplanetary monitoring platform ( imp ) experiments measure the low energy electron crs ( @xmath32 gev ) , which are not the focus of this review . in the following we only focus on several relevant missions .",
    "* ams-01 * ( alpha magnetic spectrometer - 01 ) is the predecessor to ams-02 , a detector to be operated on the international space station ( iss ) for at least 3 years ( http://ams.cern.ch/ ) .",
    "the ams-01 experiment was flown on the space shuttle discovery for ten days in june , 1998 .",
    "it was designed to search for various types of unusual matter by measuring cosmic rays .",
    "the detector consisted of a permanent nd - fe - b magnet , six silicon tracker planes , an anticoincidence scintillator counter system , the time - of - flight ( tof ) system consisting of four layers of scintillator counters and a threshold aerogel cerenkov detector . with these instruments ,",
    "the high - energy proton , electron , positron , helium , antiproton and deuterium spectra were accurately measured .",

    "the lat angular , energy and timing resolutions rely on modern solid state detectors and electronics .",
    "since electromagnetic cascades are germane to both electron and photon interactions in matter , the lat is also by its nature a detector for electrons and positrons@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the cr electron spectrum from 20 gev to 1 tev based on the first half year data also displays a spectrum hump in the @xmath36 gev range , although the signature is not as prominent as that found by atic and ppb - bets .",
    "* h.e.s.s * , the high energy stereoscopic system , is an array of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located in the khomas highland of namibia ( http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/hess/ ) .",
    "it is designed to obtain the cherenkov images of cosmic - ray hadrons and electrons , as well as gamma - ray photons ( sorted according to the relative flux ) . to measure the spectrum of electrons , the other two components ( hereafter background events ) have to be eliminated .",
    "first , data taken from the sky regions known to contain gamma - ray sources are rejected .",
    "however , the most critical aspect of the electron analysis is the efficient rejection of the hadronic background .",
    "a random forest approach was used to convert the image information into a single parameter describing the degree to which a shower is electron - like , that spans from 0 ( for hardons ) to 1 ( for electrons ) . by monte - carlo simulations ,",
    "the distribution of this parameter for simulated hadrons and electrons is determined ( see figure 1 in aharonian et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the number of measured electron showers in each energy band can then be deduced . in this way , the spectrum is measured from 0.35 - 4 tev .",
    "while the overall electron flux measured by h.e.s.s . is consistent with the atic data within statistical and systematic errors , the h.e.s.s . data do not confirm a pronounced peak in the electron spectrum suggested by atic and ppb - bets@xcite .      prior to 2008 ,",
    "the high energy @xmath24 data are consistent with a featureless power - law spectrum within errors , which is in agreement with the theoretical predictions from both analytical and numerical models@xcite .",
    "recently , the atic balloon experiment@xcite discovered a prominent spectral feature at around 600 gev in the @xmath24 spectrum .",
    "instead of a decaying feature expected by electron / positron cooling , the team discovered a clear excess of the @xmath24 in the energy range of @xmath37 gev .",
    "such a feature was also marginally observed by ppb - bets@xcite .",
    "furthermore , h.e.s.s . reported a significant steepening of the electron spectrum above @xmath38 tev@xcite .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration later reported a high - precision measurement of the @xmath24 spectrum from 20 gev to 1 tev@xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.[data - fermi ] , their measured @xmath24 spectrum may be fitted by a single power - law @xmath39 . some wiggles",
    "are evident if one ignores the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the spectrum reveals a hardening at around 100 gev and a steepening above @xmath40 400 gev .",
    "more specifically , the spectrum can be fitted by a broken power - law with indices @xmath41 for @xmath42 gev , @xmath43 for @xmath44 gev , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 gev@xcite .",
    "so in general , all detectors reveal _ an excess _",
    "beyond 100 gev on the otherwise softening spectrum , although different instrumental teams do not agree on the detailed spectral shape .",
    "the other independent indication of the presence of a possible deviation from the standard picture came from the recent measurements of the positron - to - electron ratio , between 1.5 and 100 gev by the pamela satellite experiment .",
    "pamela found that the positron fraction changes slope at around 10 gev and begins to increase steadily up to 100 gev@xcite , confirming the tendency revealed in some earlier experiments with lower significance and in a narrower energy range ( see section [ sec : experiments ] ) .",
    "this rising behavior is very different from that predicted for the secondary positrons produced by collisions of cr nuclides and the ism ( see eq.([eq : r_bg]))@xcite .",
    "we summarize the data in fig.[data - fermi ] and fig.[data - ratio ] .",
    "the latest observations call for an additional component of electrons and positrons which is clearly unaccounted for in the standard cr model .",

    "the spectrum of the particles detected on earth differs significantly from those emitted from the sources .",

    ", we will discuss three types of models that have been proposed to interpret the observed @xmath1 excess , namely , the modified snr models for the @xmath1 background , new astrophysical sources , and dark matter .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the canonical sources of crs@xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of the snrs is found to be comparable to that needed to accelerate galactic crs .",
    "the more direct evidence is the detection of the photons up to @xmath138 tev from some snrs , which are consistent with @xmath139 decay from hadronic interactions@xcite .",
    "snrs have been traditionally regarded as the dominant source to contribute to the observed @xmath1 background .",
    "this model can naturally account for a smooth , gradually softening @xmath1 spectrum at high energies .",
    "the excess feature discussed above is not expected from the simplest model . in this section",
    "we discuss whether the excess is simply due to some factors that have been ignored in the conventional snr models .",
    "as already mentioned , in the widely adopted code galprop the distribution of snrs is assumed to be homogenous .",
    "such an approximation would not affect the results of ion crs significantly . for electrons , on the other hand , due to the significant cooling caused by magnetic fields and background photons , only the electrons generated within a distance",
    "@xmath13 kpc can reach earth@xcite ( see also section [ sec : age - dist ] ) .",
    "within such a small volume , the snr source distribution can be very inhomogeneous .",
    "releasing the homogeneity assumption could therefore lead to significant modification of the detected @xmath1 spectrum .    in the milky way",
    ", star formation is concentrated in spiral arms@xcite .",
    "the nearest spiral arm , the sagittarious - carina arm , is about 1 kpc away .",
    "the inhomogeneity effect of sr source distribution in such a distance scale is therefore very important to shape the observed electron / positron cr spectrum@xcite . since @xmath136 is energy dependent ( eq.([eq : r_diff ] ) ) , an energy - dependent feature would appear .",
    "low energy electrons ( @xmath40 1 gev ) can easily reach us from a larger radius where inhomogeneity is more averaged out . on the other hand , electrons with higher energies ( @xmath138 gev ) can arrive earth only from very nearby sources since they would otherwise have cooled via synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation before reaching earth .",
    "these very nearby sources would present a bump in the @xmath1 spectrum in the @xmath140 gev range , as observed by atic and fermi .",
    "pairs formed in the local vicinity through the proton / ism interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies . as shown in fig.[fig : snr - shaviv ] , both the pamela - observed increase of the positron - to - electron ratio between 1 and 100 gev and the atic - observed @xmath1 excess around @xmath0 600 gev can be attributed to the inhomogeneity of snrs @xcite .",
    "one interesting prediction of the inhomogeneous snr model is that the positron - to - electron ratio should start to drop at energy @xmath141 100 gev , just above the present pamela measurement ( see fig.[fig : snr - shaviv ] ) .",
    "it should reach a minimum around the  atic peak \" , where it should start to rise again .",
    "this is because the nearby snrs mostly contribute to primary electrons near the `` atic peak '' , without significantly increasing secondary positrons .",
    "such a prediction is in stark contrast to the case where the @xmath140 gev excess is due to a primary source of pairs ( e.g. either the pulsar model or the dark matter models ) , in which the positron fraction is expected to keep rising at a few hundreds gev until reaching @xmath142 . the positron fraction behavior above 100 gev is the smoking gun to test this inhomogeneous snr model ( and the pair production models ) .      in the standard model",
    ", primary cosmic rays are accelerated in snrs while the secondary @xmath1 are not . in reality",
    "the secondary production also takes place in the same region where cosmic rays are being accelerated .",
    "these secondary @xmath12 participate in the acceleration process and turn out to have a flatter spectrum relative to the primaries at high energies .",
    "this could be responsible , after propagation in the galaxy , for the observed pamela anomaly@xcite . as found in solving the transport equation ,",
    "the downstream equilibrium spectrum of secondary electrons produced in the acceleration region has two terms .",

    "the other term has a spectrum @xmath144 , where the factor @xmath145 arises from the momentum dependence of the diffusion coefficient@xcite .",
    "as long as the second term dominates , the spectrum gets flattened .",

    "and large uncertainties of the model parameters , the model can make a case to account for both the @xmath1 excess and the positron fraction excess .",
    "future high quality tev data can give a more reliable test to this model .",
    "the secondary particle acceleration model has several interesting predictions .",
    "in particular , all other secondary particles ( including baryonic particles ) are also accelerated . as a result ,",
    "the antiproton to proton ratio should also increase with energy .",
    "this is a clean criterion to differentiate this model from some other astrophysical models for positron fraction excess ( e.g. pulsar models ) .",
    "some dark matter models however share the same prediction , and therefore can not be differentiated based on this criterion .",
    "a similar effect applies to secondary nuclei such as titanium and boron @xcite .",
    "these predictions can be soon tested with the data from pamela and the forthcoming ams-2 mission .",
    "finally , since this model invokes strong hadronic interactions , one would naturally expect strong hadronic neutrino signals from nearby snrs , so that icecube has good prospects to detect them .",

    "it is striking to note that this is just the energy range where the @xmath1 excesses were observed by atic , fermi , and h.e.s.s .",
    "furthermore , the energy density of the excess electrons observed by atic is about @xmath148 between 0.1 and 1 tev , which is of the order of the energy density due to cr energy loss assuming a spectral break from 2.7 to 3.1 at energy @xmath13 pev .",
    "these coincidences are the motivations of the photon - cr interaction model@xcite .",
    "indeed the interaction between cr nuclei and background photons may naturally bridge the `` knee '' of the cr spectrum and the @xmath1 excess , provided that the optical background photons have a thermal distribution with a temperature @xmath149 k@xcite .",
    "such a dense background photon field is possible in the vicinity of young snrs .",
    "one potential problem not addressed by ref . is whether the resulting pairs can escape from the source . as discussed above",

    "one needs to check whether the escaped @xmath1 can still reach the desired energy to account for the observed excess .",
    "an electron or positron moving in a dense soft photon bath would lose energy via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering@xcite and produce a high - energy ic component at @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 is the lorentz factor of the electron .",

    "so given the galactic diffuse optical background from stars , the effect takes place in the energy range where electron / positron excess is observed to appear@xcite .",
    "associated with the drop in energy loss rate in the klein - nishina regime is a gradual hardening of the cosmic ray @xmath1 spectrum . the spectral structure in the fermi and h.e.s.s .",
    "data may be reproduced in this way@xcite provided that : ( 1 ) the energy density of the seed photons is significantly higher than that of the magnetic field ( so that ic cooling is more significant than synchrotron cooling ) ; ( 2 ) the star - to - dust emission ratio @xmath160 is large enough@xcite , so that the dominant ic cooling is with respect to star optical emission . this requirement is needed since ic off the dust emission in the far - infrared range is still in the thomson regime even for relatively energetic electrons . such a cooling effect would compete with the klein - nishina cooling effect if @xmath130 is not suppressed , which would smear the @xmath1 spectral feature .",

    "the evidence for dark matter is compelling in all astrophysical scales . to be a viable dark matter candidate , one needs to satisfy some general requirements@xcite : ( 1 ) dark matter must be _ dark _ , in the sense that it must have no ( or extremely weak ) interactions with photons .",

    "the only potential candidate is neutrinos , but they are too `` hot '' and too light to be trapped in dm halos .",
    "physicists are never short of ideas of inventing non - baryonic dark matter candidates@xcite . almost all current models of dark matter use the standard concept of quantum field theory to describe the properties of elementary particle candidates ( for exceptions , see for instance refs . ) .",
    "this means that the dark matter particles can be characterized by their mass and spin . in the following",
    "we summarize the properties of several widely discussed dark matter candidates .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : dm-1 ] , the mass of the proposed candidates spans a wide range .",
    "the most studied dark matter candidates are weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the main motivation for introducing wimps is the gauge hierarchy problem , namely , the observational constraint of the mass of the spin 0 higgs boson ( a hypothetical massive particle in the standard model ( sm ) in particle physics ) , i.e. @xmath213@xcite , is much lighter than the planck mass @xmath214 .",
    "this suggests that sm is not the complete model , and there should be new physics in the energy range of the weak interaction scale @xmath215 .",
    "wimps are the predicted particles of the new physics , which naturally carries a mass with the similar energy scale . very interestingly ,",
    "this energy scale is broadly consistent with the energy scale of the pamela / atic / hess / fermi @xmath1 excess .",
    "this was the main reason that the @xmath1 excess stimulated the great excitement from the particle physics community .",
    "three types of wimps , i.e. neutralinos and other supersymmetric particles , kaluza - klein particles in universal extra dimensions , and inert higgs doublets , are discussed below .",
    "some candidates , such as axions and sterile neutrinos , have too low an energy to be relevant to the @xmath12 excess data .",
    "since they are physically well motivated , we nonetheless include them for the sake of completeness .",
    "[ tab : dm-1 ]      the most widely discussed wimps are neutralinos , one type of the supersymmetric ( sysy ) particles . supersymmetry ( susy ) is an ingredient in many superstring theories trying to unite all the fundamental forces of nature , including gravity@xcite .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is most elegantly solved by susy . in susy extensions of the standard model",
    ", every standard model particle has a new , as yet undiscovered partner particle , which has the same quantum numbers and gauge interactions , but differs in spin by @xmath216 . from the standpoint of dark matter ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle is naturally stable in models that conserve @xmath217-parity , which is defined as @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the baryon number , @xmath220 the lepton number and @xmath221 the spin of the particle@xcite .",
    "the ordinary particles and their superpartners have @xmath222 and @xmath223 respectively , which means that supersymmetric particles can only be created or annihilated in pairs in reactions of ordinary particles , or a single supersymmetric particle can only decay into final states containing an odd number of supersymmetric particles ( plus some standard model particles ) .",
    "the idea that supersymmetric particles could be good dark matter candidates became attractive when it was realized that breaking of susy could be related to the electroweak scale , and that the supersymmetric partner of the photon ( the photino ) would couple to fermions with electroweak strength@xcite .",
    "below we list some supersymmetric dark matter candidates@xcite with brief discussion .",
    "* _ neutralinos _ in models of r - parity conserving supersymmetry are by far the most widely studied dark matter candidates .",
    "since the superpartners of the @xmath224 boson ( zino ) , the photon ( photino ) and the neutral higgs ( higgsino ) have the same quantum numbers , they can mix to form four eigenstates of the mass operator called `` neutralinos''@xcite .",
    "in many models the lightest of the four neutralinos @xmath225 turns out to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is , therefore , stable and can only be destroyed via pair annihilation ( neutralinos have spin @xmath216 and are their own antiparticles ; that is , they are majorana fermions ) .",
    "@xmath225 can be produced thermally in the hot early universe and leave approximately the right relic abundance to account for the observed @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the hubble s constant in units of @xmath228 .",
    "these facts make @xmath225 with a mass of roughly 10 - 10000 gev , an excellent cold dark matter candidate .",
    "they may be detected directly through scattering in detectors , or indirectly through the decay products that result when neutralinos annihilate in pairs@xcite . * _ sneutrinos _ are the superpartners of the standard model neutrinos in the supersymmetric models .",
    "they have a spin @xmath229 , and have long been considered as dark matter candidates@xcite . if their mass is in the range of @xmath230 tev , the sneutrinos can have a cosmologically interesting relic density@xcite . from the direct detection searches sneutrinos",
    "have been excluded as the major component of the dark matter@xcite . however , in the supersymmetric models with the inclusion of right - handed fields , sneutrinos are still compatible with the current direct detection sensitivities and could be a viable dark matter candidate@xcite . *",
    "_ gravitinos _ are the spin @xmath231 superpartners of gravitons in the supersymmetric models , and could be the lightest , stable supersymmetric particle .",
    "although strongly theoretically motivated , gravitinos as dark matter would be very difficult to observe due to their extremely weak interactions with ordinary matter@xcite .",
    "long lived gravitinos may impose problems to cosmology .",
    "for example , their presence may destroy the abundances of primordial light elements@xcite .",
    "these problems can be circumvented in some scenarios@xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of a broken r - parity , the constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis are naturally satisfied and decaying gravitinos would lead to characteristic signatures in high energy cosmic rays@xcite .",
    "our world appears to consist of @xmath232 dimensions ( three spatial dimension and one time dimension ) .",
    "it is however possible that there exist other @xmath233 spatial dimensions , which appear at much higher energy scales , as suggested by kaluza and klein in the 1920s . in the extra - dimension models ,",
    "the @xmath234-dimension space - time one experiences is a structure called a `` brane '' , which is embedded in a @xmath235 space - time called the `` bulk '' .",
    "upon compactification of the extra dimensions , all the fields propagating in the bulk have their momenta quantized in units of @xmath236 , where @xmath237 denotes the size of the extra dimensions@xcite . as a result , for each bulk field a set of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states ( i.e. fourier expanded modes ) appear . in the 3 + 1 dimensional world",
    ", these kk states appear as a series of states with masses @xmath238 , where @xmath239 labels the mode number .",
    "each of these new states contains the same quantum numbers , such as charge , color , etc@xcite .",
    "usually the standard model fields are assumed to be confined on the brane and only gravity is allowed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "however it might be possible for all the standard model particles freely propagate in the extra dimensions@xcite .",
    "such a scenario is the so - called universal extra dimensions .",
    "the simplest universal extra dimension models preserve a discrete parity known as the kk - parity , implying that the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) is stable and can be an interesting , possible dark matter candidate@xcite .",
    "the lkp is typically the level 1 partner of the hypercharge gauge bosons , denoted as @xmath240  @xcite .",
    "the wmap limit of @xmath241@xcite corresponds to a mass of the dark matter candidate @xmath240 between roughly 0.5 to 1 tev , depending on the exact form of the mass spectrum and the resulting co - annihilation channels@xcite .",
    "current collider measurements give a constraint of @xmath242 , whereas lhc may probe the kk mass parameter space up to @xmath243 tev@xcite .",
    "inert higgs are a type of wimps that are introduced in one of the most minimal extensions of the standard model .",
    "back in 1978 , it was noted that a model with two higgs doublets containing a discrete symmetry could contain a state , the lightest neutral scalar or pseuodoscalar boson , which is stable@xcite .",
    "it is the subject of the renewed interest recently since it could be used to solve the naturalness problem in the standard model@xcite .",
    "the possibility of one of the lighter neutral states in the enlarged higgs sector to be the dark matter was also pointed out , and soon the basic properties of this `` inert '' higgs candidate for dark matter were investigated@xcite .",
    "it turns out that this model contains a dark matter candidate , an `` inert '' particle that couples gauge bosons only and is stable due to its discrete symmetry . taking into account the relic density constraints from wmap and various theoretical and experimental constraints ,",
    "the latest constraint on the mass of the inert higgs is @xmath244 gev ( middle mass range ) or @xmath245 gev ( high mass range)@xcite .",
    "candidates in the middle mass range may annihilate through @xmath224 or through higgs .",
    "some solutions in the middle mass range may also have a large annihilation cross section , through loop corrections , into a pair of gamma rays .",
    "this is relevant for indirect detections of dark matter through annihilation at the galactic center , and such a gamma ray line would be easily observed by the fermi satellite@xcite . for the inert higgs dark matter candidates in the high mass range , annihilation into @xmath246 pairs is allowed with a large cross section@xcite .",
    "axions were introduced in an attempt to solve the strong @xmath247 problem in particle physics@xcite .",
    "they are still one of the leading dark - matter candidates .",
    "the axion mass is defined by @xmath248 where @xmath249 mev , @xmath250 mev and @xmath251 mev are masses of the up quark , down quark and pion , and @xmath252 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "the axion phenomenology is therefore determined by , up to a numerical factor , by one number only , i.e. the energy scale @xmath253 of symmetry breaking .",
    "a variety of astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments constrain @xmath253 to be between @xmath254 and @xmath255 , suggesting an axion mass @xmath256 ev .",
    "smaller masses would lead to an unacceptably large cosmological abundance , while larger masses are ruled out by combinating of constraints from supernova 1987a , globular clusters , laboratory experiments , and the search for two - photon decays of relic axions@xcite .",
    "the lifetime of axion is @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is a model - dependent parameter and @xmath259 is expected not to deviate from 1 significantly . in general , its very small mass makes axion not possible to interpret the 100 gev @xmath1 excess discussed in this review .    within the susy theories ,",
    "axions have spin @xmath216 superpartners , which are called axinos .",
    "models combining susy and the peccei - quinn@xcite solution to the strong cp problem necessarily contain this particle .",
    "depending on the model and the susy breaking scheme , the axino mass can range from ev to gev .",
    "although widely believed to be only capable of acting as a warm , or hot dark matter candidate@xcite , it was recently shown that for quite low reheating temperatures , cold axino dark matter may be possible@xcite .",
    "interesting astrophysical signals are expected from axinos if the r - parity is broken@xcite .",
    "the standard ( active ) neutrinos were considered as a favored particle dark matter candidate in late 1970 s , when the calculations of the massive neutrino relic density were first carried out@xcite . to account for the dark matter of a dwarf galaxy of velocity dispersion @xmath260 typically of order @xmath261 and core radius @xmath262 typically @xmath263",

    "therefore the standard neutrinos are too light to be the dominant component of dark matter , although among the proposed candidates for non - baryonic dark matter standard neutrinos have the `` undisputed virtue of being known to exist''@xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos , unlike standard ( active ) neutrinos , do not interact through standard weak interactions@xcite . instead",
    ", they communicate with the rest of the neutrino sector through fermion mixing@xcite .",
    "the existence of sterile neutrinos ( right - handed or gauge singlet ) is one of the most attractive explanations of the observed flavor oscillations of active neutrinos .",
    "sterile neutrinos were proposed as dark matter candidates in 1994@xcite .",
    "stringent cosmological and astrophysical constraints on sterile neutrinos come from the analysis of their cosmological abundance and the study of their decay products@xcite .",
    "a very recent analysis finds out that sterile neutrino dm with mass @xmath267 kev is consistent with all existing constraints@xcite . on the other hand , this mass is too low to account for the 100 gev @xmath1 excess feature discussed in this review .      in many dark matter models ,",
    "the dark matter particles are their own anti - particles ( majorana fermions ) , and can annihilate with each other .",
    "there are several possible dm annihilation scenarios : ( i ) dm particles annihilate to standard model particle pairs , such as gauge bosons , quarks , and lepton pairs@xcite ; ( ii ) dm particles annihilate via virtual internal bremsstrahlung processes to produce @xmath268@xcite ; ( iii ) dm particles annihilate to new mediating particle pairs , which then decay to @xmath269 and other standard model particles@xcite .",
    "according to these scenarios , dark matter annihilation would lead to electron / positron pairs , and may account for the pamela / atic / hess / fermi @xmath1 excess ( see e.g. , refs . , , , , , , , ) . according to these scenarios , the resulting lepton spectra would have a cut off energy at the dm mass @xmath270 .",
    "hence , the cutoff energy seen in fermi / hess ( or atic ) data would suggest @xmath271 ( or 0.6 ) tev .    the dark matter self - annihilation scenarios , which have been extensively discussed since 1970s , are not the only possibilities to produce signatures for dark matter indirect detections .",
    "strictly speaking , the viability of a particle as a dark matter candidate does not require its absolute stability , but merely require that the dark matter lifetime @xmath272 is much longer than the age of the universe ( i.e. , @xmath273 s ) .",
    "hence , if dark matter decays at a sufficiently high rate , the decay products might be detectable .",
    "in particular , if the dm decays predominately into leptons in a time scale @xmath274 s ( which is long enough not to cause other cosmological problems ) , the detected 100 gev @xmath1 excess may be also reproduced ( see e.g. , refs . , , ) . in these dm decay scenarios , the resulting @xmath1 spectra would have a cutoff at an energy @xmath275 .",
    "hence , the cutoff energy seen in fermi / hess ( or atic ) data would suggest @xmath276 ( or 1.2 ) tev .    in both the annihilation and decay scenarios ,",
    "the dm required in the modeling belongs to the wimp category .",
    "this is encouraging since weak - scale particles make an excellent dark matter candidate , having the merit of the so - called wimp miracle : in the simplest type of models of thermally produced dark matter , an average of the annihilation rate at the time of chemical decoupling can be estimated as @xmath277 , where @xmath278 is the thermal average of the total annihilation cross section @xmath279 multiplied by velocity @xmath280 . taking the relative velocity of colliding dm particles at the decoupling time @xmath281 , one has @xmath282 , or @xmath283~{\\rm gev}$ ] .",
    "this mass is in the energy range of weak interaction energy scale , and hence the particle is likely a wimp .    in the following , we review the annihilation and decay models in turn .",
    "in the dark matter annihilation scenarios , the source term of the electrons / positrons is given by @xmath284 where @xmath285 is the energy spectrum of the electrons / positrons produced by dm annihilation , @xmath286 is the dark matter density distribution in the annihilating region , and @xmath287 based on the wimps miracle argument discussed above ( i.e. the usual dm annihilation rate producing the @xmath1 excess signal is also related to the annihilation rate producing the cosmological relic dm density ) . with a given @xmath288",
    ", one can solve the propagation equation ( i.e. , eq.[[eq : propagation ] ] ) and get the final electron / positron spectra detected on earth .",
    "for such a purpose , the density distribution of the dark matter halo is needed .",
    "various models of dm halo density distribution have been proposed .",
    "some popular ones can be parameterized as @xmath289^{(\\zeta-\\upsilon)/\\omega},\\ ] ] where @xmath290 is the dm density in the vicinity of the sun , @xmath291 kpc is the solar distance from the galactic center , and the profile parameters @xmath292 are @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 for the core isothermal model@xcite , the navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) model@xcite and the moore model@xcite , respectively .",
    "it is well known that only the tev cr @xmath1 produced within a distance @xmath13 kpc can reach us , i.e. , @xmath296 , hence the above 3 popular ( but different ) dark matter density distribution models give rise to rather similar cr @xmath1 signals .",
    "the photon signals from these three different models , such as the gev - tev gamma - rays generated from inverse compton scattering off the cmb photons by the tev @xmath1 s or the synchrotron radiation of the tev @xmath1 s , can however reach us from a much larger distance range including the core of the dm halo .",
    "these signals therefore can be very different for different models .",
    "if dm annihilation also produces hadronic pairs , the spectrum of the antiproton crs can be also very different for different models , since antiprotons are more rigid and much less radiative so that they can reach from much larger distances .",
    "the non - detections of a prominent electromagnetic spectral signals in the radio ( synchrotron origin ) and gev - tev ( inverse compton origin ) bands , as well as the non - detection of a prominent antiproton cosmic ray signal , therefore impose stringent constraints on the dm density profile and/or the dm annihilation properties .    since the first release of the pamela data ,",
    "many candidate wimp dm models have been studied .",
    "the spectral shape of the observed @xmath1 excess is not difficult to reproduce if the annihilations proceed mostly to leptons rather than to quarks , gauge bosons , and so on .",
    "for example , two - body annihilations directly into @xmath1 pairs produce a hard spectrum , which can be adjusted to be consistent with the atic data .",
    "if the two - body final states are @xmath297 or @xmath298 pairs , their subsequent decays into @xmath1 can produce a soft enough spectrum consistent with the fermi and hess data .",
    "however , in all these models , the thermal average cross section multiplied by velocity @xmath299 is found to be too small to account for the flux level detected by pamela / atic / fermi / hess .",
    "an unnaturally large `` enhancement / boost factor '' , @xmath300 , is needed .",
    "quite a few mechanisms have been proposed to introduce such a @xmath301 factor .",
    "( 1 ) if dm halos have substructures , the local density can be enhanced so that the annihilation optical depth can be increased@xcite .",
    "detailed n - body simulations , on the other hand , show that the boost factor introduced by dm substructures is generally less than @xmath302 ; ( 2 ) it is possible that dm in the early universe was not in equilibrium . in the scenarios of non - thermal production of dm , the interaction rate responsible for the @xmath12 excesses are not directly related to the relic dm density .",
    "one may simply assume that the interaction rate is that required from the @xmath12 excess data , and no boost factor is needed@xcite ; ( 3 ) more physically , there might exist new mediating particles during the dm annihilations .",
    "examples include the sommerfeld mechanism@xcite and the breit - wigner mechanism@xcite .",
    "the sommerfeld mechanism@xcite is a non - relativistic quantum mechanical effect .",
    "a large boost factor can be produced if dm interacts with a new light particle .",
    "without such an interaction , annihilation of dm is a short distance effect .",
    "if dm interacts with a nearly massless ( light ) particle , then there is an additional long - range force ( with coulomb - like potential @xmath303 ) , which would distort the dm wave - function before annihilation happens .",
    "this would introduce a modification factor to the annihilation cross section , so that @xmath304 .",
    "the factor @xmath221 is the sommerfeld factor . by solving the non - relativistic schrdinger equation",
    ", one can derive @xmath305 . assuming a dark matter particle @xmath225 coupling to a mediator @xmath306 with coupling strength @xmath307 , for s - wave annihilation in the nonrelativistic limit , one gets @xmath308 for @xmath309 and @xmath310 for @xmath311 , where @xmath312 is the velocity ( in units of @xmath65 ) of each dm particle in the center - of - mass frame@xcite .",
    "@xmath313 is then achievable if @xmath314 for @xmath309 or @xmath315 for @xmath311 .",
    "the breit - wigner mechanism@xcite applies to the case of a heavy mediating particle . for most masses of the mediating particle ,",
    "the cross section is not enhanced .",
    "however , if the annihilation of dm is through the s - channel and if the new particle has a mass about twice of the dm mass , the cross section and annihilation rate can be greatly enhanced near a resonance point .",
    "this introduces a large enough @xmath316 to interpret the data .",
    "another challenge the dm model faces in the @xmath12 excess modeling is the non - detection of an excess in the antiproton spectrum@xcite .",
    "contrary to the data , most dm annihilation models invoke a large hardronic annihilation fraction .",
    "the requirement of having excesses only in @xmath1 but not in anti - proton spectrum , along with the large boost factor needed as discussed above , pose great constraints and eliminate many candidate dm annihilation models .",
    "for example , the most popular dm candidate , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can give rise to the @xmath1 excesses@xcite .",
    "however , as a linear combination of photino , zino and higgsino , lsp usually has a large hadronic annihilation fraction , which is in conflict with the pamela anti - proton data .",
    "this model also suffers the problem of realizing a large boost factor . for the kk dark matter particles , direct annihilation to @xmath317",
    "is possible .",
    "in fact , the lightest kk particles ( lkp ) was recognized @xcite as a potentially important source of positrons when the @xmath1 excess was found by heat earlier . in the atic discovery paper@xcite",
    ", the kk models was also introduced as an example to account for the observed @xmath24 spectrum peak around 600 gev .",
    "these models again require a significant fraction of annihilation in hadronic modes ( @xmath318 ) , which is at odds with the pamela antiproton data ( cf . ref . ) .",
    "the required large boost factor @xmath316 is attributed to halo sub - structures , which was found difficult to achieve . in the inert higgs model , for a candidate with @xmath319 gev ,",
    "the dm annihilation contribution to @xmath21 and anti - proton fluxes is much smaller than the expected backgrounds . even if a boost factor is invoked to enhance the signals , the particle candidate is unable to explain the observed @xmath21 and anti - proton data . only a high mass candidate , with @xmath320 tev , would be possible to fit the pamela excess provided a large enhancement , either in the local dm density or through the sommerfeld effect@xcite .",
    "such a heavy particle , however , is in contradiction with the constraint from wmap and various theoretical and experimental constraints@xcite .",
    "recently two types of models have been constructed to account for the detection of the excess in the electron / positron channel but not in the antiproton channel ( see ref .",
    "for a recent review ) :    \\(1 ) the kinematically limited light particle decay models ( e.g. , refs . , ) ; these models require the existence of a light particle with a mass less than the sum of proton and anti - proton masses .",
    "such a low mass makes hadronic modes kinematically inaccessible and forces the particle decay predominantly into leptons . to accommodate the very high annihilation rate required to reproduce the current @xmath12 excess",
    ", the light particle decay model makes use of its light force - carrier to generate the sommerfeld enhancement@xcite .",
    "for instance , in the mssm extended by a singlet chiral superfield , the singlino - like neutralino dark matter annihilates to light singlet - like higgs bosons , which proceed to decay to either electron - positron or muon - antimuon pairs .",

    "if the required boost factor @xmath339 is not due to the dm substructures , and if one assumes such a boost and adopts a universal navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile of dm halos , a large annihilation @xmath35ray flux from nearby galaxy clusters is predicted . with the parameters that well fit the pamela and fermi data@xcite and the standard assumptions for the limiting mass of the substructures within dm halos , it is found that the egret upper limit in @xmath86-ray flux is violated in virgo@xcite .",
    "similarly , the predicted gamma - ray flux violates the hess upper limit constraints from the galactic center and some dwarf spheroidals , and the predicted radio flux from synchrotron emission of the produced @xmath1 from the galactic center also violates the current radio observation upper limits .",
    "the upper limits may be satisfied only if the dm density profile is significantly less steep than the benchmark nfw and einasto profiles@xcite .",
    "the diffuse @xmath35ray data from the fermi first year observations have imposed a very tight constraint on the dm annihilation models and suggests that the annihilation models likely only work in some `` fined - tuned '' situations@xcite . from theoretical point of view , it is shown@xcite that the enhancement required in the sommerfeld - enhanced dm annihilation models implies a thermal relic density that is too small to allow the dm candidate suitable for interpreting the @xmath1 feature to account for all the dm in the universe . in ref .",
    "the authors also derived an upper bound on the possible sommerfeld enhancements from the observations of elliptical galactic dm halos and showed that these bounds generically exclude such an explanation .",
    "counterarguments were also raised recently .",
    "it was argued@xcite that there are a lot of uncertainties in calculating the @xmath86-ray signals from the nearby dwarf spheroidals and the galactic center , and that the annihilation models do not conflict with the fermi gamma - ray limits .",
    "it was also found that the annihilation models are better than other models to account for the microwave signals collected by wmap in the galactic center@xcite .",
    "the dark matter particles are often assumed to be perfectly stable as the result of a symmetry , e.g. r - parity in the supersymmetric models .",
    "however , from the gravitational evidence for the existence of dark matter we can only infer that dark matter has to be stable on timescales ( much ) longer than the age of the universe .",
    "in other words , dm particles are allowed to decay .",
    "if they decay at a sufficiently high rate , the decay products might be detectable as cosmic rays , which would result in the observed @xmath1 excess .",
    "there are in fact some physically well - motivated dark matter candidates that have very long lifetimes before decaying .",
    "for instance , gravitino dark matter , which is unstable due to a small breaking of the r - parity , constitutes an interesting scenario that leads to a thermal history of the universe consistent with the observed abundances of primordial elements , the observed dark matter relic abundance , and the observed baryon asymmetry@xcite .",
    "some other decaying dm candidates discussed in the literature include hidden gauge bosons@xcite , hidden gauginos@xcite , right - handed sneutrinos in r - parity breaking scenarios@xcite , kk dark matter in a simple extension of the minimal universal extra dimension models by introducing a small curvature@xcite , and baryonic bound states of messenger quarks@xcite .",
    "the late decay of dark matter particles , for example gravitinos , can produce gamma rays@xcite , positrons @xcite , neutrinos@xcite and/or antiprotons@xcite , which contribute to the total fluxes received at the earth .    in the dark matter decay scenario(s ) , the source term of the electrons / positrons is given by @xmath340 where @xmath341 is the energy spectrum of the electrons / positrons produced by the decay of each dm particle .",
    "evidently , in the decay model the parameters involved regarding the dm properties are the mass @xmath270 , the lifetime @xmath272 , and the spectrum of decay , @xmath341 .    in order to account for",
    "the excess in the electron / positron channel but not in the antiproton channel , the decay of dm should mainly produce leptons with suppressed hadronic branching ratios . as a result ,",
    "the leptophilic decaying dm scenarios have attracted considerable attention . as in the annihilation scenarios ,",
    "leptophilic decaying dm models can be broadly divided into two categories@xcite .",
    "one is that dm first decays into some new light particles , which subsequently decay into muons or electrons , while decays into hadrons are forbidden by kinematics .",
    "the other is that the dm particle couples mainly to leptons due to symmetry@xcite or geometric setup@xcite .",
    "although the decay models are not as widely investigated as the annihilating models , they have some advantages that are not shared by the annihilation models .",
    "first , in the decay models there is no need of the `` boost factor '' given the freedom of choosing the decay lifetime of the dm particles .",
    "second , decay models suffer much less constraints from the gamma - ray and radio observations from the galactic center@xcite .",
    "similar to the annihilation models , only the tev @xmath1 pairs generated within a distance @xmath13 kpc can reach us . in the popular nfw profile of the dark matter halo with @xmath342 ,",
    "one expects a much higher dm density near the galactic center .",
    "the gamma - ray signals produced in inverse compton scattering off the star light and cmb by pairs produced in the galactic center can reach the earth . since the decay flux is proportional to the dm density @xmath78 rather than proportional to @xmath343 as in the annihilation models ,",
    "the decay models predict a much fainter signal than the annihilation models .",
    "the non - detection of such signals pose strong constraints on the annihilation models , but not the decay models ( c.f . ref . ) .    in the phenomenological approach",

    "predictions for the positron fraction for various decay channels and different dark matter masses and lifetimes can be then computed@xcite . in the case of a fermionic dark matter particle , people usually consider the two - body decay channels @xmath346 , @xmath347 , as well as the three - body decay channels @xmath348 , with @xmath349 being the charged leptons . for a scalar dark matter particle",

    "* it is possible that the observed @xmath1 excesses originate from a new astrophysical cr source .",
    "the leading candidate is pulsars@xcite .",
    "pulsars are known to be able to produce electron / positron pairs , which may be accelerated to the desired high energies outside the magnetospheres ( likely in snr shocks ) .",
    "no excess in the spectrum of antiproton cosmic rays is expected , in agreement with the pamela result .",
    "the escape of these pairs from the associated snr , however , is unclear .",
    "one popular assumption is that pulsars should be mature , for which the associated snr is too old to trap the pairs .",
    "the potential problem is that mature pulsars have lost a significant fraction of their initial kinetic energy and may not be powerful enough to reproduce the observations .",
    "some other new astrophysical sources discussed in the literature include microqusars@xcite and local gamma - ray bursts@xcite .",
    "the results are rather uncertain in these scenarios . *",
    "the most extensively discussed interpretation of the @xmath1 excesses is the annihilations or decays of dark matter .",
    "the excesses in positrons and antiprotons in the cr spectra are two `` standard '' predictions of these models@xcite .",
    "the detection of a rising positron - to - electron ratio is a good news for these models .",
    "the non - detections of an excess in the antiproton spectrum , however , calls for modifications of most canonical dark matter models .",
    "phenomenologically , one usually assumes that@xcite ( 1 ) the dark matter particles annihilate or decay into new particles , which are so light that can only finally decay into @xmath12 and/or @xmath5 ; ( 2 ) the dm is leptophilic and couples only to leptons due to symmetry . in the dm annihilation models an unnatural large `` boost factor '' @xmath361",
    "is needed to reproduce the pamela / atic / fermi detected @xmath1 fluxes .",
    "such an unusually large boost factor is difficult to interpret simply by invoking substructures in the dm halo .",
    "some particle - physics - oriented suggestions , such as the sommerfeld and briet - wigner mechanisms , have been invoked to account for the large excess .",
    "many specific models have emerged and are able to fit the electron / positron excesses .",
    "there are however some additional observational constraints .",
    "for example , almost all dark matter models predict a certain level excess of @xmath86 ray .",
    "the latest diffuse @xmath35ray data from the fermi first year observations have excluded a large portion of the dm parameter space@xcite .",
    "( in contrast , the constraints on the astrophysical models are rather weak , since they are `` local '' phenomena and just occupy a small fraction of the volume of the galaxy ) . in the case of annihilating dm , those models generating predominantly @xmath5 and assuming a cored isothermal - like dm profile can fit the data with a mass @xmath362 tev , but for other parameters , the model suffers various observational constraints and is less favored ( c.f . ref . ) . in the case of decaying dm , again except those models generating predominantly @xmath5 ( which can fit the data with @xmath276 tev and @xmath363 sec ) , most models are not favored by various observational constraints .",
    "it is worth noting that recently direct searches of dark matter have been performed by various experimental groups .",
    "for example , the cdms ii collaboration has observed two candidate events@xcite .",
    "if interpreted as dm recoil on nuclei , the dm particles detected by cdms ii should be relatively light , with a mass @xmath364 gev .",
    "this is much lower than that needed in the @xmath1 excesses modeling . due to low statistics ,",
    "it is of course too early to say that the observed @xmath1 excesses are not of the dm origin . in any case",
    ", direct detection experiments and the high energy colliders ( such as the large hadron collider ) would play an essential role to probe the nature of dm , and to provide a test to the current dm interpretations of the @xmath1 excesses . in the near future , neutrino observations by the upcoming high energy neutrino detectors ( such as icecube ) would also help to constrain the dm nature of the @xmath1 excesses@xcite .",
    "all the models reviewed here assume that the detected cosmic ray @xmath1 excesses are due to one physical process .",
    "in reality , this may not be the case .",
    "for example , it is possibly that the detected excesses are mainly contributed by astrophysical processes , and the dm annihilation / decay signals are outshone .",
    "if so , the extraction of the dm properties via indirect detection experiments would be even more challenging .",
    "nevertheless further indirect detection experiments are still necessary since they are complementary to the direct detection experiments and the collider experiments for revealing the properties of dm .",
    "for instance , collider experiments may identify a long - lived , weakly interacting particle and measure its mass . on the other hand",
    ", it would be difficult to test its cosmological abundance and stability .",
    "such goals , however , are achievable in the direct and/or indirect detection experiments .",
    "we conclude that both astrophysical processes and dm annihilation or decay models can provide a self - consistent explanation to the recently observed @xmath1 excesses in the cosmic ray spectrum . at present",
    "the dark matter interpretations seem to be more exotic than some astrophysical scenarios .",
    "this is in particular the case for the dark matter annihilation models which are tightly constrained by the @xmath35ray observational data by fermi .",
    "in fact the latest diffuse gamma - ray data have excluded a large region of the dm parameter space that is favored in interpreting the @xmath1 excesses .",
    "more experimental observations are needed to pin down the nature of dm and its implications for the @xmath1 excess . among the promising astrophysical models ,",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution of supernova remnants has a smoking gun prediction that the positron - to - electron ratio is expected to decrease above an energy @xmath47 gev .",
    "the pulsar model , instead , predicts an increasing positron - to - electron ratio up to the energy @xmath13 tev .",
    "these two predictions will soon be tested by the ongoing pamela and the upcoming ams-2 experiments .",
    "both the inhomogeneous snr model and the pulsar model predict a possible wiggle - like structure in the tev energy range , which may be constrained by the observations of h.e.s.s - like ground based cherenkov telescopes .",
