    "the deconfined and novel nuclear matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , has been expected to appear in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the observation of large elliptic flow of different hadronic species at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national lab , new york , is of special importance to confirm the the formation of qgp . unlike those bulk hadrons ,",
    "photons are produced during the whole history of the evolution of the hot and dense matter .",
    "moreover , the mean free path of photons is much larger than the transverse size of the bulk matter .",
    "so the produced photons pass through the surrounding matter without any interaction . as a result ,",
    "thermal photons provide undistorted information on flow asymmetries not only from its surface but also from the inner of the hot , dense matter .",
    "therefore the question such as what is the relation between the measurable elliptic flow @xmath0 of thermal photons and the evolution process of the expanding hot dense matter is of interest .",
    "this relation will serve as a direct bridge between the observables and the properties of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "a pioneering work has been done based on 2d ideal hydrodynamics , which has shown the transverse momentum and centrality dependence of the elliptic flow of thermal photons at midrapidity@xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the elliptic flow of thermal photons is calculated based on 3d ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in sec .  2 we will briefly review the space - time evolution of the hot and dense matter using 3d ideal hydrodynamics and the basic formula for the production of thermal photons . in sec .  3",
    ", we will show our results on the transverse momentum and centrality dependences of thermal photons @xmath0 in au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev .",
    "section 4 is devoted to discussion and summary of our results .",
    "in our calculation , a full 3d ideal hydrodynamic calculation is employed to describe the space - time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the impact parameters corresponding to different centralities in au+au collisions at rhic , which are estimated with a glauber model , are 3.2 , 5.5 , 7.2 , 8.5 , 9.7 , 10.8 , and 11.7 fm for 0 - 10% , 10 - 20% , @xmath5 and 60 - 70% centrality , respectively .",
    "the local thermal equilibrium is assumed to be reached at the initial time @xmath6 fm/@xmath3",
    ". the critical temperature of a first order phase transition between the qgp phase and the hadron phase is fixed at @xmath7 mev .",
    "the initial flow is taken to be bjorken scaling solution .",
    "so the transverse flow is vanishing at @xmath8 and dynamically generated by the pressure gradient .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of thermal photons can be written as @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the lorentz invariant thermal photons emission rate , @xmath11 being the volume - element , the integration is done from the initial time @xmath8 to the freeze - out , and @xmath12 the photon energy in the local rest frame .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    the elliptic flow is quantified by the second harmonic coefficient @xmath0 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the azimuthal angle of photon s momentum with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of the triple differential spectra is strongly affected by the flow @xmath16 through the argument @xmath12 in the photon emission rate .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetry of the transverse components of the flow obviously results in an anisotropic momentum distribution , which gives a finite @xmath0",
    ". therefore both strength and the anisotropy of transverse flow velocity are important to generate the elliptic flow of thermal photons .",
    "the two key features of qgp , mean radial flow @xmath17 and the mean anisotropy of flow @xmath18 , are defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for energy - density - weighted space - time average , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the flow velocity components along @xmath23-axis and @xmath24-axis , respectively . from table",
    "[ cent ] , we see that the mean radial flow increases with centrality from 0 - 10% ( @xmath25 fm ) to 20 - 30% ( @xmath26 fm ) , then decreases from 20 - 30% ( @xmath26 fm ) to 60 - 70% ( @xmath27 fm ) . on the other hand , the mean flow anisotropy increases with centrality from 0 - 10% to 60 - 70% monotonically . the increase of the average radial flow between 0 - 10% and 20 - 30% can be understood due to the fact that the initial shape of matter becomes more asymmetric , leading to flow asymmetry , as discussed earlier .",
    "the decrease beyond 20 - 30% is due to the decreasing life times , which prevents large flows from developing .",

    "in fact if we include all sources of direct photons , the @xmath4-integrated @xmath0 will not differ much , for two reasons : + 1 ) the yield of direct photons at higher @xmath4 is small because the @xmath4 spectrum of direct photons decreases rapidly though all sources of direct photons are counted@xcite .",
