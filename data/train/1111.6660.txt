    "exactly solvable models may seem to be almost a closed chapter in the development of quantum field theory .",
    "our original aim for looking at this class of simple relativistic theories was to learn about their properties in the light - front ( lf ) formulation and compare that picture with the standard one ( by the latter we mean conventional operator formalism in terms of usual space - like ( sl ) field variables ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , a closer look at these models revealed certain inconsistencies and contradictions in the known sl solutions .",
    "for example , the fock vacuum was taken as the true ground state for calculations of the correlation functions in the thirring model @xcite although a derivation of the model s hamiltonian shows that it is non - diagonal when expressed in terms of corresponding creation and annihilation operators .",
    "hence the fock vacuum can not be its ( lowest - energy ) eigenstate .",
    "another example is the ( massless ) schwinger model , often invoked as a prototype for more complicated gauge theories .",
    "it turns out that the widely - accepted covariant - gauge solution @xcite involves some unphysical degrees of freedom as a consequence of residual gauge freedom .",
    "a rigorous analysis @xcite in the axiomatic spirit showing some spurious features of the solution @xcite remained almost unnoticed and a less formal , e.g. a hamiltonian study correcting the physical picture seems to be lacking in literature .    defining property of the soluble models",
    "is that one can write down operator solutions of the field equations .",
    "hence , one should be able to extract their physical content completely .",
    "a novel feature that has been overlooked so far is a necessity to formulate these models in terms of true field degrees of freedom  the free fields .",
    "as we show below , the operator solutions are always composed from free fields .",
    "one should take this information into account by re - expressing the lagrangiam and consequently the hamiltonian in terms of these variables .",
    "one can summarize the above statement by a slogan : `` work with the right hamiltonian ! ''",
    "recently , we applied this strategy to the massive derivative - coupling model ( dcm ) , the thirring and the federbush models .",
    "the brief summary of the achieved results is given in the following section .",
    "then we extend our approach to the case of the chiral gross - neveu model , the thirring - wess and the schwinger model .",
    "not all the details are worked out at the present stage ",
    "we formulate the main ideas and indicate the strategy to be followed .",
    "the full treatment of the models will be given separately @xcite .",
    "we conclude the present paper with a brief description of the symmetry - breaking pattern fully based on the light - front dynamics .",
    "* the model with derivative coupling * @xcite turns out to be almost a trivial one .",
    "its lagrangian = ^- m+ - ^2 ^2 - gj^ ,   j^=^. [ dl ] leads to the dirac equation which is explicitly solved in terms of a free scalar and fermion field : ( x ) = : e^ig(x):(x ) ,  i^(x ) = m(x ) .",
    "[ dcmsol ] the massive scalar field @xmath0 obeys the free klein - gordon equation as a consequence of the current conservation .",
    "the conventional canonical treatment yields a surprising result : the obtained lf hamiltonian is a free one while the sl hamiltonian contains an interacting piece , which is non - diagonal in terms of fock operators and hence its true ground state ( which can be obtained by a bogoliubov transformation ) differs from the fock vacuum .",
    "so the physical pictures in two quantization schemes contradict each other .",
    "the explanation is simple .",
    "one observes that the solution ( [ dcmsol ] ) means that there is no independent interacting field - it is composed from the free fields .",
    "we have to insert the solution to the lagrangian first ( analogously to inserting a constraint into a lagrangian ) , then calculate conjugate momenta and derive the hamiltonian . in this way , a free lagrangian and hamiltonian",
    "are found also in the sl case .",
    "the new procedure does not alter the lf result .",
    "the correlation functions in the two schemes coincide as well .",
    "they are built from free scalar and fermion two - point functions .    *",
    "the thirring model * @xcite with its lagrangian describing a self - interacting massless fermi field = ^- gj_j^ ,   j^=^[tl ] is a more complicated theory .",
    "the simplest solution is similar to eq.([dcmsol ] ) but the elementary scalar field @xmath1 is replaced by the composite field @xmath2 defined via @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath4 is non - diagonal in composite boson operators @xmath5 built from fermion bilinears according to & & j^(x ) = -k^\\{c(k^1)e^-i.x - c^(k^1)e^i.x } , + & & c(k^1 ) = dp^1\\{(p^1k^1 ) + ( p^1)(p^1(p^1-k^1))d(k^1-p^1)b(p^1)}. [ bcur ] a diagonalization by a bogoliubov transformation @xmath6 implemented by a unitary operator @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is a suitably chosen function , generates the true ground state as = n",
    "\\{-c^(p^1 ) c^(-p^1 ) } 0 .",
    "[ vacsim ] here @xmath9 is a normalization factor and @xmath10 is a @xmath11-dependent function .",
    "@xmath12 corresponds to a coherent state of pairs of composite bosons with zero values of the total momentum , charge and axial charge .",
    "thus no chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the model at least for @xmath13 where the diagonalization is valid . *",
    "the federbush model * @xcite is the only known _ massive _ solvable model .",
    "the solvability comes from a specific current - current coupling between two species of massive fermions described by the lagrangian = ^- m+ ^- - g_j^h^. [ ffl ] here the currents are @xmath14 .",
    "the coupled field equations i^(x ) = m(x ) + g_^h^(x)(x ) ,   i^(x ) = ( x ) - g_^j^(x)(x ) have the solution of the form ( [ dcmsol ] ) with two `` integrated currents '' @xmath2 and @xmath15 .",
    "one again finds that the structure of the sl and lf hamiltonians coincides only when the operator solution is implemented in the lagrangians .",
    "however , the sl hamiltonian is not diagonal and a bogoliubov transformation is needed to find the physical ground state .",
    "this requires a generalization of klaiber s massless bosonization yielding a complicated substitute for @xmath16 of eq.([bcur ] ) . in a sharp contrast , the lf massive bosonization is as simple as the sl massless one .",
    "the model is very suitable for a non - perturbative comparison of the two forms of the relativistic dynamics .",
    "this is because 2-d massless fields can not be treated directly in the lf formalism ( only as the massless limits of massive theories - this is obvious already from the lf massive two - point functions ) .",
    "exponentials of the massive composite fields are more singular than the massless once .",
    "they have to be defined using the `` triple - dot ordering '' @xcite which generalizes the normal ordering ( subtractions of the vevs order by order ) .",
    "we avoid this by bosonization of the massive current .",
    "the price we pay is complicated commutators at unequal times that are needed for computation of correlation functions . in any case",
    ", the correlators in the sl and lf version of the theory should coincide in form . a remarkable albeit for the moment only a conjectured scenario is that this will indeed happen with complicated operator structures plus non - trivial vacuum structure in the sl case and with much simpler operator part plus the fock vacuum in the lf case .",
    "the lagrangian and field equations of the chiral gross - neveu model @xcite are = ^- ,   i^_= g. [ njlem ] this theory is a 2-d version of the nambu  jona - lasinio model . when rewritten in the component form , one realizes that the above equations up to the sign coincide with those in the thirring model : i(_0 - _ 1)_1 = 2g_2_1_2 = -2g_2_2_1 = -g(j^0 + j^1 ) , + i(_0 + _",
    "1)_2 = 2g_1_2_1 = -2g_1_1_2 = -g(j^0 - j^1 ) .",
    "[ njleq ] inserting the solution known from the thirring model into the lagrangian , we find the hamiltonian h = \\{-i^^1_1 + g(j^0j^0 - j^1j^1 ) + .",
    "we can bosonize the scalar densities @xmath17 , @xmath18 : ( x ) = ^+_- ,  _",
    "5(x ) = ^+_- [ fsig ] with the fock expansions for the fermi field and after the fourier transform , we obtain & & a(k^1,t ) = \\{(p^1(k^1-p^1))e^i2p^1 t + & &  - ( p^1k^1)(p^1)e^-i2p^1t}e^-ik^1 t , [ ak ] and similarly for @xmath19 .",
    "one then has to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath20 where & & h_1 = - _ -^+ dk^1 k^1 , + .",
    "& & h_2 = - _ -^+ dk^1 k^1 \\{+}. obviously @xmath21 is not an eigenstate of @xmath4 .",
    "the true vacuum has to be found by a bogoliubov transformation",
    ". it will be different than the thirring - model vacuum and probably non - invariant under @xmath22 .",
    "this remains to be verified .",
    "we also leave for future work generalization of the model to @xmath23 flavours .",
    "this model @xcite is simpler than the schwinger model because the nonzero bare mass of the vector field removes gauge invariance with all its subtleties .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian = ^-g_g^ + _ 0 ^ 2b_b^-ej_b^ ,  g_=b_- _ b_. [ tw ] leads to the field equations  the dirac and proca equations : i^_(x)= e^b_(x)(x ) ,   g^(x ) + _ 0 ^ 2 b^(x ) = ej^(x ) .",
    "[ dproc ] the rhs of the second equation reduces to @xmath24 since @xmath25 due to the current conservation .",
    "the latter condition also permits us to write down the solution of the corresponding dirac equation as ( x)=\\{-^5(x^1-y^1)b^0(y^1,t)}(x ) ,  ^(x ) = 0 .",
    "[ twsol ] product of two fermion operators has to be regularized by a point - splitting .",
    "the integral in the exponent contributes naturally to find ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the free currents ) j^(x ) = j^(x ) - b^(x ) ,",
    "j_5^(x ) = j_5^(x ) - ^b_(x ) .",
    "[ bcur ] inserting the above @xmath28 to the proca equation , one finds that the the bare mass is replaced by @xmath29 and that this equation can be easily inverted since only the free fields are involved .",
    "thus , there is no dynamically independent vector field . following our method , we insert the solutions for @xmath30 and @xmath31 into lagrangian and then derive the hamiltonian . the question",
    "if the latter will be diagonal or will have to be diagonalized , together with other properties of the model , is under study .",
    "the masslessness of the vector field makes the schwinger model more subtle than was the previous one .",
    "the key question is to correctly handle the gauge variables since in the covariant gauge @xmath32 not all gauge freedom has been removed .",
    "we implement the gauge condition in the lagrangian as @xcite : = ^-f_f^ -ej_(x ) a^(x ) -g(x)a^(x ) + ( 1-)g^2(x ) ,   f_=a_-a_. [ sml ] the gauge - fixing terms furnish the component @xmath33 with the conjugate momentum , @xmath34 . moreover , they guarantee restriction to an arbitrary covariant gauge in which neither the condition @xmath35 nor the maxwell equations @xmath36 hold as operator relations .",
    "the gauge fixing field obeys @xmath37 so that positive and negative - frequency parts @xmath38 are well defined .",
    "our strategy is to proceed in the spirit of k. haller s generalization @xcite of the gupta - bleuler quantization , in which the unphysical components of the gauge field are represented as ghost degrees of freedom of zero norm , carrying vanishing momentum and energy . to ensure that we are dealing with the original 2-dimensional qed",
    ", we have to restrict the theory to the physical subspace @xmath39 .",
    "we will choose @xmath40 in the above lagrangian .",
    "then the gauge condition is an operator relation while the ( modified ) maxwell and dirac equations read f^(x ) = ej^(x ) - ^g(x ) ,   i^_(x)= e_a^(x)(x ) .",
    "[ adir ] the solution of the latter is completely analogous to the thirring - wess model case , eq.([twsol ] ) .",
    "again , the vector and axial - vector currents have to be calculated via point - splitting with an important difference : the exponential of the line integral of the gauge field must be inserted in the current definition to compensate for the violation of gauge invariance due to the point splitting . after inserting the calculated interacting current into the maxwell equations , we have to express the lagrangian and hamiltonian in terms of the free fields as before",
    ". the physical picture will become transparent if we make a unitary transformation to the coulomb - gauge representation @xcite . before performing this step ,",
    "let us indicate the main ingredients of the original covariant - gauge solution @xcite and point out a problem with it .",
