    "<S> we present the analysis of the stellar content of ngc  2282 , a young cluster in the monoceros constellation , using deep optical @xmath0 and iphas photometry along with infrared ( ir ) data from ukidss and @xmath1-irac . based on the stellar surface density analysis using nearest neighborhood method , </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the cluster is estimated as @xmath2 3.15@xmath3 . from optical spectroscopic analysis of 8 bright sources , we have classified three early b - type members in the cluster , which includes , hd 289120 , a previously known b2v type star , a herbig ae / be star ( b0.5 ve ) and a b5 v star . from spectrophotometric analyses , the distance to the cluster has been estimated as @xmath2 1.65 kpc . the @xmath4-band extinction map is estimated using nearest neighborhood technique , and the mean extinction within the cluster area is found to be a@xmath5 @xmath2 3.9 mag . using ir colour - colour criteria and h@xmath6-emission properties , we have identified a total of 152 candidate young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the region , of which , 75 are classified as class ii , 9 are class i ysos . </S>",
    "<S> our yso catalog also includes 50 h@xmath6-emission line sources , identified using slitless spectroscopy and iphas photometry data . </S>",
    "<S> based on the optical and near - ir colour - magnitude diagram analyses , the cluster age has been estimated to be in the range of 2 @xmath7 5 myr , which is in agreement with the estimated age from disc fraction ( @xmath2 58% ) . </S>",
    "<S> masses of these ysos are found to be @xmath2 0.1@xmath72.0 m@xmath8 . </S>",
