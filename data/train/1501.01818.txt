    "the determination of the hubble constant @xmath9 from astronomical observations is very important in cosmology , as it gives the present cosmic expansion speed and is related to the cosmic components and the size and age of our universe .",
    "its first accurate value , @xmath10 at the @xmath2 confidence level ( cl )  @xcite , was obtained using local measurements from the hubble space telescope .",
    "about 10 years later , riess et al .",
    "@xcite improved this result significantly using cepheids and very - low - redshift type ia supernovae ( snia ) and obtained @xmath11 , where the uncertainty was reduced from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the cosmic distance ladder , the hubble constant can also be determined using cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurement . on the basis of a six - parameter @xmath14 cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "model , the nine - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap9 ) data give @xmath15 , a @xmath16 determination  @xcite . combining wmap9 with smaller angular scale cmb data from the south pole telescope ( spt ) and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) as well as distance measurements derived from baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) observations improves this determination to @xmath17 and gives @xmath18  @xcite , which is consistent with the result ( @xmath19 ) determined by median statistics from huchra s final compilation  @xcite .",
    "recently , in the framework of a six - parameter @xmath14cdm model , the planck collaboration also found that @xmath20  @xcite and @xmath21  @xcite , which are consistent with the value ( @xmath22 )  @xcite obtained by combining galaxy bao measurements from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) survey of sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii )  @xcite with high - precision measurements of the relative distances of the latest snia  @xcite .",
    "however , the planck results are slightly smaller than the wmap9 one and have a tension of about @xmath23 with respect to local measurements given in  @xcite .    on one hand , this tension might indicate the need for new physics such as the cosmic variance  @xcite or a super - accelerating expansion  @xcite , but on the other hand , it may also be due to systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "for example , revising the geometric maser distance to ngc 4258 from @xcite and using this indicator to calibrate the data considered in  @xcite , efstathiou  @xcite yielded @xmath24 . considering predominantly star - forming environments ,",
    "rigault et al .",
    "@xcite found @xmath25 .",
    "these results are consistent with that of planck . in addition",
    ", the systematic errors in the cmb analysis may also be responsible for some part of the tension . by removing the @xmath26 detector set spectrum used in the planck analysis",
    ", it was found that @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the very - low - redshift data from local measurements and the cmb data at @xmath28 , the intermediate - redshift data provide a complementary tool for determining the hubble constant , and they help to reduce the uncertainties of @xmath9 significantly if they are combined with cmb data .",
    "cheng and huang  @xcite combined bao data from the 6df galaxy survey  @xcite , boss data release 11 ( dr11 ) clustering of galaxies  @xcite , wigglez  @xcite , and @xmath29 from the boss dr11 quasar lyman-@xmath30 forest lines  @xcite , as well as simultaneous measurements of the two - dimensional two - point correlation function from the boss dr9 cmass sample  @xcite and the two - dimensional matter power spectrum from the sdss dr7 sample  @xcite , and found that in a @xmath14cdm model , @xmath27 , a @xmath31 determination . using the wmap9+spt+act+6dfgs+boss / dr11+@xmath9/riess and basing their analysis on the six - parameter @xmath14cdm cosmology , bennett et al .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath32 , a @xmath33 determination , which is the most accurate result to date . through a nonparametric reconstruction of @xmath7 data , busti et al .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath34 by extrapolating the reconstruction to redshift @xmath35 .",
    "all these results seem to be consistent with that of planck . however , using other intermediate - redshift data including angular diameter distances ( adds ) from the spherical @xmath4 model galaxy cluster sample  @xcite , 11 ages of old high - redshift galaxies  @xcite , 18 @xmath7 data points  @xcite , and the bao peak at @xmath36  @xcite , lima and cunha  @xcite found @xmath37 in a @xmath14cdm model .",
    "this value is consistent with the result obtained in  @xcite .",
    "later , holanda et al .",
    "@xcite considered the effects of different galaxy cluster samples and found that different samples give different results , i.e. , @xmath38 if the spherical @xmath4 model galaxy cluster sample  @xcite is replaced by the elliptical one  @xcite . therefore , not only local and global measurements but also different intermediate - redshift data may yield controversial results for the value of the hubble constant .",
    "the above discussion illustrates that , except for direct measurement from the cosmic distance ladder and nonparametric reconstruction from @xmath7 data , the reported results are based on the @xmath14cdm model . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new model - independent method to determine @xmath9 by combining the observed luminosity distances ( lds ) from snia data and adds from galaxy clusters or baos .",
    "the measurement of snia is very important in modern cosmology , and it first indicates that the present expansion of our universe is speeding up . the observed snia data are usually released in the form of the distance modulus @xmath39 , which is related to the ld @xmath40 by @xmath41 the value of the distance modulus is determined mainly by the rest - frame peak magnitude @xmath42 and the peak absolute magnitude @xmath43 of snia . because @xmath43 is degenerate with @xmath44 , we must choose a value of @xmath1 to obtain the distance modulus .",
    "for example , @xmath45 in the sdss - ii sample  @xcite , and @xmath46 in the union 2 one  @xcite . because @xmath47 in the friedmann  robertson  walker universe , letting @xmath48 denote the chosen value of @xmath1 to determine the distance modulus",
    ", one finds that @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the released distance modulus with @xmath51 . combining eq .",
    "( [ mu4 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ mu0 ] ) gives the @xmath1-dependent ld from the distance modulus of snia : @xmath52    several light curve fitting methods are used to analyze snia data .",
    "here , we consider the mlcs2k2  @xcite fitting method and the salt2  @xcite method for comparison . in the mlcs2k2",
    "fitter , the estimated value and uncertainty of the distance modulus are obtained independent of any cosmological models . for this",
    "fitter , we use the 288 sdss - ii snia data points  @xcite in our analysis , which are given with @xmath53 .    for the salt2 light curve fitting method , the released distance modulus is model - dependent , as the observed value of the distance modulus is obtained using @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a stretch factor that describes the effects of the shapes of light curves on @xmath39 , and @xmath56 is a color parameter that denotes the influences of the intrinsic color and reddening by dust .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath4 , and @xmath43 are fitted by minimizing the residuals in the hubble diagram in the framework of the @xmath14cdm model . for the salt2 fit ,",
    "we consider the union 2.1  @xcite snia sample , which is obtained with @xmath57 and consists of 580 data points .    from eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) , one can see that , if the ld can be obtained from other observations and is independent of @xmath1 , the value of the hubble constant can be determined directly by combining them with the snia observations , and the result is model - independent  cdm model . ] .",
    "however , no observations other than snia can provide the observed value of the ld directly .",
    "fortunately , the add @xmath58 can be obtained from some observations , such as galaxy clusters and baos . using the distance duality relation between the ld and the add , @xmath59",
    ", we can deduce the value of @xmath40 at a redshift of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , if one has observed snia and galaxy cluster ( or bao ) data at the same redshift and assumes that the distance duality relation is valid , the combination of these data provides a model - independent method to constrain @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because the distance duality relation is valid in any metric theory of gravity , and its validity has been tested in  @xcite using different datasets .",
    "the above analysis shows that finding the observed ld ( @xmath60 ) from the distance modulus of snia and the add from galaxy clusters or baos at the same redshift is necessary to constrain @xmath1 in a model - independent way . because the snia data sample is much larger than that of galaxy clusters or baos , to obtain a tight constraint , all add data should be kept . owing to the usual absence of snia data at the same redshift as",
    "add data , we use a binning method to give the corresponding ld value of snia .",
    "this means that all snia data available in the range @xmath61 are binned , where @xmath62 represents the redshift of the add data , and constant @xmath63 represents the binned redshift region . using the criterion that the standard deviation of the set of @xmath64 in a bin has the same order of magnitude as @xmath65 , which is defined in eq .",
    "( [ sig ] ) , to determine the value of @xmath63 , we choose @xmath66 .",
    "for all the selected data , an inverse variance weighted average is employed .",
    "if @xmath67 denotes the @xmath42th appropriate snia distance modulus data in a bin with the given redshift @xmath68 , in which there are @xmath69 snia data points , and @xmath70 represents the corresponding observational uncertainty , one can straightforwardly find , using the conventional data reduction techniques in  @xcite , that @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the weighted mean distance modulus at a given redshift @xmath68 , and @xmath74 is its uncertainty .",
    "if the observational uncertainties of the distance modulus are released with the covariance matrix @xmath75 , using a method similar to that given in  @xcite , we find that the weighted mean distance modulus in a bin and its uncertainty can be expressed as follows : @xmath76 @xmath77 when only the statistical errors are considered , @xmath75 is a diagonal matrix , and @xmath78 . in this case ,",
    "( [ bu2 ] ) and ( [ sig2 ] ) reduce to eqs .",
    "( [ bu1 ] ) and ( [ sig ] ) , respectively .",
    "using eq .",

    "in @xcite , it was suggested that the add of a galaxy cluster can be derived from a measurement of its intrinsic size on the basis of the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect and x - ray surface brightness observations . here ,",
    "we employ two different galaxy cluster samples : the spherical @xmath4 model sample and elliptical @xmath4 model sample .",

    "the latter was compiled in @xcite using an isothermal elliptical @xmath4 model and consists of @xmath97 add data in the redshift region @xmath98 , in which 18 galaxy clusters were compiled in @xcite and 7 galaxy clusters were compiled in @xcite .",

    "<S> by using type ia supernovae ( snia ) to provide the luminosity distance ( ld ) directly , which depends on the value of the hubble constant @xmath0 , and the angular diameter distance from galaxy clusters or baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) to give the derived ld according to the distance duality relation , we propose a model - independent method to determine @xmath1 from the fact that different observations should give the same ld at a given redshift . </S>",
    "<S> combining the sloan digital sky survey ii ( sdss - ii ) snia from the mlcs2k2 light curve fit and galaxy cluster data , we find that at the @xmath2 confidence level ( cl ) , @xmath3 for the sample of the elliptical @xmath4 model for galaxy clusters , and @xmath5 for that of the spherical @xmath4 model . </S>",
    "<S> the former is smaller than the values from other observations , whereas the latter is consistent with the planck result at the @xmath6 cl and agrees very well with the value reconstructed directly from the @xmath7 data . with the sdss - ii snia and bao measurements , a tighter constraint , @xmath8 , is obtained . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider the union 2.1 snia from the salt2 light curve fitting . </S>",
    "<S> the results from the union 2.1 snia are slightly larger than those from the sdss - ii snia , and the union 2.1 snia + baos give the tightest value . </S>",
