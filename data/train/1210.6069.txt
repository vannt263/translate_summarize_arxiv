    "it is well know that decreasing dimensionality is a means of increasing the effect of interactions in electronic systems . in one dimension",
    "this leads to luttinger liquid behaviour and a variety of manybody instabilities.@xcite in two dimensions there also is a huge variety of strongly interacting electronic systems,@xcite leading to phenomena as diverse as the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite or high temperature superconductivity @xcite , to name two of the more prominent ones .",
    "a purely two - dimensional system by construction is monolayer graphene ( mlg),@xcite which is a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms .",
    "this system has remarkable electronic properties,@xcite and a lot of these can be traced back to the fact that the low - energy theory assumes the form of an emergent massless dirac equation.@xcite in this system , while with magnetic field the fractional quantum hall effect has been observed,@xcite without magnetic field the observation of interaction effects is scarce to date .",
    "one of the reasons of the robustness of the underlying electronic system against interactions is the vanishing density of states at the fermi level.@xcite    in bilayer graphene ( blg ) systems the situation is different.@xcite the major difference stems from the fact that instead of massless dirac particles , we deal with massive quasi",
    " particles .",
    "@xcite these occur since in the low - energy effective theory we have two bands which touch at one point , however not in a linear but in a quadratic fashion , implying a finite band mass.@xcite as a consequence , even at charge neutrality ( cn ) , the density of states is finite instead of zero as in mlg .",
    "this implies that the system is much more unstable with respect to interactions .",
    "a variety of different symmetry broken states with a finite gap are conceivable,@xcite , for instance by explicitly breaking the interlayer symmetry by an external gate voltage.@xcite without external perturbations there are indications that below @xmath4k blg undergoes a spontaneous transition to a gapped state.@xcite the exact nature of this state is currently under dispute @xcite and further theoretical and experimental activities are required to identify it unambiguously .",
    "within this paper we do not attempt to speculate about the nature of this symmetry broken state but instead focus on interaction effects and their signature in transport properties .",
    "consequently our theory only applies for temperatures which are above the gap scale .",
    "it also neglects the scattering of electronic degrees from collective modes which can be precursors to the transition to the ordered state .    in a first part",
    ", we investigate the minimal conductivity of clean blg . as in the case of mlg",
    "there is a well - defined minimal conductivity , even in absence of impurities solely due to ( screened ) coulomb interaction .",
    "this is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry in the model and holds true for every particle - hole symmetric system .",

    "paticles , and @xmath8 is the dielectric constant of the environment .",
    "interestingly , it saturates for low temperatures as opposed to the standard behavior in fermi liquids where it diverges ( due to the vanishing phase space ) .",
    "in a second part we study the effect of coulomb drag .",
    "this is a very direct measurement of coulomb interaction between two electrically isolated two  dimensional electronic systems .",
    "the experimental setup goes as follows : a current is driven in one of the layers , called the active one .",
    "then coulomb interaction can transfer momentum to the other layer , called the passive one .",
    "if the current is not admitted to flow there , a voltage drop will be induced",
    ". this can be measured , and the ratio of the current in the active layer and the voltage drop in the passive layer is called the drag resistance .    our study provides the first comprehensive study of coulomb drag in blg in all limits ranging from cn to the fermi liquid ( fl ) regime . to the best of our knowledge experimental results for such a setup are currently unavailable , and we are only aware of one theoretical study.@xcite for high doping we find that the system behaves like a standard fl , and we discuss all the limiting cases as a function of temperature @xmath9 and distance @xmath10 between the layers . unlike in the case of mlg , where there is a well - defined regime of zero distance , this regime is lacking here due to the small screening length . in the opposite limit ,",
    "close to cn , we find that drag depends very sensitively on the ratio between relaxation due to interaction and disorder , thus inelastic and elastic scattering .",
    "a similar behavior has recently been observed in theoretical studies of drag in parallel mlgs.@xcite    technically , this paper follows in large part the lines of a recent publication @xcite on drag in a mlg setup and consequently we present little technical detail .",
    "the generalization to the present situation is pointed out in the paper and straightforward if not explained otherwise .",
    "the model hamiltonian in our problem in general consists of two copies of the free blg hamiltonian for the active and passive layer , respectively , as well as interactions within and in - between layers .",
    "it reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the active layer and @xmath13 the passive .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the free hamiltonian in both layers , @xmath15 the interaction within each layer , while @xmath16 describes the interaction between layers .",
    "disorder is implemented within each layer via @xmath17 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a standard effective two - band description of blg @xcite . around the points @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "we can expand the dispersion and end up with the following effective hamiltonian : @xmath20 @xmath21 is the effective mass of blg,@xcite and @xmath22 is the electron mass .",
    "the two bands , subsequently identified with electron ( @xmath23 ) and hole ( @xmath24 ) band , have the respective energies , @xmath25 . in this approximation ,",
    "the system is particle  hole symmetric at cn ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xmath27 sums over the spin and valley degrees of freedom , consequently in blg we have @xmath28 . in the follwing",

    "since we are interested in conductivities we express the current in the particle  hole basis . as in the case of mlg",
    "the current decomposes into two contributions @xmath37 where the first accounts for the motion of the quasi  particles , while the second is the incoherent contribution . in terms of the electron and hole operators they read @xmath38\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the unit vector perpendicular to the bilayer plane .",
    "like in the case of mlg the d.c .",
    "conductivity is dominated by @xmath40 corresponding to the quasi ",
    "particle contribution which produces a drude peak in the absence of disorder and interactions . in the following",
    "we investigate the broadening of this quasi  particle peak .",
    "we consider the effect of coulomb interaction , which in two dimensions is given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the two layers separated by the distance @xmath10 , which mediates the coulomb drag , reads : @xmath43    unlike mlg undoped blg has a finite density of states at the cn point .",
    "like in the two  dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , this is constant , and given by @xmath44 this implies that coulomb interactions are always screened and in the static limit @xmath45 the coulomb interaction within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) becomes @xmath46 where we have defined the inverse thomas - fermi screening length @xmath47 this corresponds to very small distances and defines the bohr radius , which becomes important subsequently .",
    "the rpa for the two  layer setting is more involved and reads for the intra ",
    "layer interaction @xmath48 for the inter ",
    "layer interaction we find @xmath49    in order to express the coulomb interactions in the quasi ",
    "particle basis it proves useful to introduce the coherence factor @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "however , for finite chemical potential the current carrying states excites a global momentum and we have to take into account breaking of translational invariance due to the presence of impurities to relax the momentum .",
    "we model disorder as charged impurity scattering with the hamiltonian    @xmath58 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we use the variational principle to calculate conductivities from linearized boltzmann equation as described in chapter 7 of ref .  .",
    "generalizations to drag are straightforward and can for instance be read in ref .  .",
    "the one  particle distribution functions of electrons ( @xmath23 ) and holes ( @xmath24 ) in the layer @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60we use the following ansatz for the non  equlibrium distribution function @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the equilibrium distribution function ( fermi function ) @xmath63 we will use a one mode approximation , , taking into account only the momentum mode @xmath64 .",
    "one can easily incorporate other modes like @xmath65 into the formalism .",
    "we have checked in the limiting cases of our study , that including these modes gives modified numerical values with corrections smaller than 1 per cent .",
    "consequently , we have discarded them throughout .",
    "the collision integrals , which are part of the boltzmann treatment , are shown explicitly in appendix  [ app : collision ] .",
    "they can be derived directly from the interaction terms via fermi s golden rule or equivalently from a keldysh calculation.@xcite      we calculate the drag resistivity from the conductivities obtained from a boltzmann approach , see app .",
    "[ app : collision ] .",
    "we consider the response tensor which has a structure similar to the one in the hall effect .",
    "the electric field @xmath66 is only applied in the active layer @xmath12 , and induces a current in the active layer called @xmath67 .",
    "it can also induce a current @xmath68 in the passive layer , which is the drag effect . consequently , there are layer  diagonal and layer off  diagonal conductivities involved : @xmath69 this tensor includes the individual conductivities @xmath70 and @xmath71 of the active and of the passive layer , respectively .",
    "the layer off ",
    "diagonal part is called the drag conductivity , denoted by @xmath72 , and it corresponds to a cross  conductance . in the concrete experiment , however , the boundary conditions are such that the passive layer does not carry current .",
    "demanding @xmath73 requires a field counteracting the flow in the passive layer which is given by @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that the drag resistivity ( or transresisitivity ) is given by @xmath75    like in the case of thermal transport @xmath76 can be finite even if the individual conductivities @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 diverge.@xcite this is an effect of the boundary condition of vanishing charge flow in the passive layer analogous to a finite thermal conductivity in thermal transport in fermi liquids.@xcite",
    "in this section we describe the conductivity of an isolated blg sheet . in the drag setup",
    "this limit is naturally achieved by setting the distance @xmath3 between active and passive layer to infinity . as in the case of mlg",
    "this quantity is well defined at the cn point , even in absence of impurities .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the particle - hole symmetry in the system , which implies that the current carrying state has effectively zero total momentum .",

    "corresponds to the fine structure constant of graphene .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it has a logarithmic flow to zero upon decreasing temperature @xmath6 . in the large n limit",
    "it was found @xcite that the numerical prefactor is given by @xmath79 . while in mlg at cn it is justified to neglect the effect of screening due to the lack of density of states ,",

    "@xmath89 where the exponential factor accounts for the fermi distribution function .",

    "the leading correction is linear in @xmath90 and consequently consequently produces a behavior corresponding to @xmath1 ( note that one can again understand this from dimensional analysis taking into account that the dynamical exponent is @xmath91 ) .",

    "our subsequent discussion has a number of natural dimensionless parameters associated with different regimes .",
    "first and foremost , the parameter @xmath93 allows to distinguish whether we are in the fl regime ( @xmath94 ) or in the limit close to cn ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is always much larger than one for practical purposes , and consequently will not be discussed explicitly .",
    "we always assume coulomb interaction to be screened .",
    "a further parameter important for the screening of the inter ",
    "layer interaction is given by @xmath97 .",
    "due to @xmath98 , which is the inverse bohr radius , we are always in the limit @xmath99 . the parameter which allows to distinguish a clean system , meaning that the single  layer conductivities are dominated by coulomb scattering , from a disordered system , where the single  layer conductivities are set by impurity scattering , is given by @xmath100 .",
    "this corresponds to ratio of the impurity concentration , @xmath101 , to the typical thermal momentum squared , or , equivalently , to the ratio of the scattering times associated with impurity scattering and coulomb scattering .",
    "in order to get the overall qualitative picture we have plotted the full crossover curve of drag in fig .",
    "[ fig : drag_qtf10 ] .",
    "we observe that it is very reminiscent of the full crossover curve in mlg .",
    "however , as we will point out , there are important differences , mainly due to the fact that even in pristine blg there is an additional energy scale due to the finite band mass .",
    "this mostly shows up in the distance dependence in the fl regime as well as on the behavior upon approaching the cn point .     and @xmath102 ( solid line ) , @xmath103 ( dashed line ) , @xmath104 ( dotted line ) . the single  layer conductivities @xmath105 are disorder dominated ( @xmath106 )",
    ". then the maximum is located at @xmath107.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in the case of drag in mlg the effect of impurity scattering cancels exactly from @xmath109 in the fl regime .",
    "consequently , all information about disorder is gone ( this equally applies to a 2deg ) . using the same steps and manipulations as in the mlg,@xcite",
    "one can show that within the one - band approximation    @xmath110    where the density of states @xmath111 was defined in eq .",
    "and @xmath112 is the screened inter - layer interaction , eq .  .",
    "for @xmath113 the polarization function @xmath114 ( the @xmath115 refers to the fact that only the quasi  particle contribution of the majority charge carrier is taken into account ) assumes the standard fermi - liquid form given by @xmath116    scaling @xmath117 and @xmath118 allows to identify three natural dimensionless parameters : @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we can then write the drag resistivity as a prefactor times a function which only depends on dimensionless parameters , namely @xmath122 with    @xmath123    since we have three independent parameters , we expect to find eight different regimes , depending on whether the parameters are much larger or smaller than unity .",

    "there are four limiting cases in this regime , two of them being physically sensible .",
    "we first discuss the situation of @xmath125 .",

    "consequently , there will be no saturation of distance dependence as in the case of mlg.@xcite      here we find only two liming cases the reason being that this limit is incompatible with @xmath138 .",
    "as in the case of mlg , this regime is characterized by a linear in @xmath6 behavior . in the limit @xmath139",
    "we have two situations , one in which @xmath133 with @xmath140 while for @xmath131 we have @xmath141    again it is important to note that the last regime is only theoretically possible .      from the preceding discussion",
    "we conclude that in experiment only three different regimes can be realizable : @xmath142 unlike mlg there is no regime in which drag becomes independent of the distance @xmath3 .      in this limit drag resistivity",
    "is very sensitive to the ratio of the inelastic scattering time due to coulomb interaction and the elastic impurity scattering time .",
    "this behavior has recently been analyzed for mlg @xcite and qualitatively the result in the blg case is similar .",
    "the drag resistivity is well  defined and finite even in the clean system at finite chemical potential , where the individual layer and drag conductivities diverge .",
    "the parameter which allows to go from the dirty limit to the clean limit is given by @xmath143 for @xmath144 we realize the clean limit , while for @xmath145 we are in the dirty limit .",
    "in contrast to the fl regime , where elastic scattering drops out exactly , we find that the drag resistivity depends strongly on @xmath146 . for disorder dominated single ",
    "layer conductivities , @xmath147 , we find a maximum in the drag resistivity at @xmath107 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : drag_qtf10 ] . the same was shown to hold in mlg.@xcite for smaller values of @xmath148 , the maximum shifts to smaller values of @xmath149 . in the following we use the parameter @xmath150 for both layers , active and passive , individually as the dimensionless chemical potential .",
    "it was pointed out in the context of mlg@xcite that there are now two orders of limits in which one can describe coulomb drag in a clean system at particle  hole symmetry .",
    "if one first considers the system at cn , @xmath151 , drag vanishes irrespective of the disorder strength by virtue of lack of momentum transfer .",
    "however , if one first extrapolates to the clean system , @xmath144 , at finite chemical potential and afterwards takes the limit @xmath152 one ends up with a finite drag resistivity .",
    "like in the case of mlg the first way to take the limits is the physical one , resulting in a vanishing drag at particle  hole symmetry . in total",
    ", this shows that the drag resistivity sensitively depends upon the ration between inelastic and elastic scattering in the vicinity of cn .",

    "<S> in contrast to monolayer graphene , we find no saturation of drag as a function of the distance @xmath3 for realistic parameters . in the vicinity of cn </S>",
    "<S> , we find an interesting interplay between interaction effects and disorder , like in the case of monolayer graphene . here </S>",
    "<S> the drag resistivity strongly depends upon the ratio of the corresponding scattering times . </S>"
