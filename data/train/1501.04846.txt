    "they represent current active star formation sites .",
    "the study and census of star formation sites in regions of higher galactic latitudes have received comparatively little attention and coverage .",
    "however , the detection and characterisation of star formation sites across the whole galaxy have strong implications on its structure and evolution .    in our previous studies of star formation in the outer galaxy ,",
    "we have reported discovery of what can be designated as star formation sites in extreme environments , namely near the distant `` edge '' of the galactic disc ( at galactocentric distances of about 16.5  kpc @xcite ) , or far below the midplane of the galactic disc ( at vertical distances of about 500  pc @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "the presence of molecular material and of clusters of embedded stars in these environments posit that the physical conditions required to form a cluster of stars are met in locations at distances away from the galactic plane ( or away from the galactic centre ) larger than reasonably expected .",
    "iras  06345 - 3023 is an iras psc source in the outer galaxy that currently appears classified in the simbad data base as `` 6dfgs gj063630.0 - 302542  galaxy '' .",
    "this means that it is listed in the 6dfgs , the six - degree field galaxy survey catalogue as being an extragalactic source .",
    "however , a search in the 6dfgs catalogue , at the iras coordinates , does not return this source .",
    "instead , a different source ( g0636403 - 302842 ) is presented , which is located about 4 arcminutes away . in addition , ned ( the nasa extragalactic database ) does not contain this source .",
    "@xcite first called attention on the presence of two nebulous `` stars '' on eso / src j plates at this location .",
    "@xcite used the 4  metre nanten milimetre telescope to study a sample of intermediate - to - high latitude iras sources and reported detection of co emission from iras  06345 - 3023 .",
    "their co maps , although at a coarse angular resolution , show a clear peak at the position of the source .    as part of our study of young",
    "embedded clusters in the outer galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have conducted observations ( near - infrared @xmath0 imaging , and millimetre co line ) towards iras  06345 - 3023 .",
    "these observations revealed the presence of young stars embedded in a molecular cloud core .",
    "we report here our near - infrared discovery of an aggregate of young stars seen towards iras  06345 - 3023 .",
    "in addition , we use new co data , to characterise the molecular environment and derive its kinematic distance .",
    "section  2 describes the observations and data reduction . in section  3",
    ", we present and discuss the results .",
    "a summary is given in section  4 .",
    "near - infrared ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) images were obtained on 2000 november 12 and on 2002 january 8 using the eso antu ( vlt unit 1 ) telescope equipped with the short - wavelength arm ( hawaii rockwell ) of the isaac instrument .",
    "the isaac camera @xcite contains a 1024 @xmath5 1024 pixel near - infrared array and was used with a plate scale of 0.147 arcsec / pixel resulting in a field of view of 2.5  @xmath5  2.5 arcmin@xmath6 on the sky . for each filter , dithered sky positions were observed .",
    "a series of 12 images with individual on - source integration time of 6 and 3.55 seconds was taken in the @xmath2 and in the @xmath3 bands , respectively . similarly ,",
    "series of 6 images , each of 2 second integration time , were obtained in the @xmath4 band .",
    "the images were reduced with the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) , using a set of our own scripts to correct for bad pixels , subtract the sky background , and flatfield the images .",
    "dome flats were used to correct for the pixel - to - pixel variations of the response .",
    "the selected images were then aligned , shifted , trimmed , and co - added to produce a final mosaic image for each band @xmath0 .",
    "correction for bad pixels was made while constructing the final mosaics that cover about @xmath7 arcmin@xmath6 on the sky .",
    "point sources were extracted using daofind with a detection threshold of 5@xmath8 .",
    "the images were inspected to look for false detections that had been included by daofind in the list of detected sources .",
    "these sources were eliminated from the source list .",
    "aperture photometry was made with a small aperture ( radius = 0.5@xmath9 ) and aperture corrections , found from bright and isolated stars in each image , were used to correct for the flux lost in the wings of the psf .",
    "the error in determining the aperture correction was @xmath10 0.03 mag in all cases .",
    "we used the 2mass all - sky release point source catalogue @xcite to calibrate our observations .",
    "the @xmath0 zeropoints were determined using 2mass stars brighter than @xmath4 = 14.7 mag .",
    "the standard deviations of the offsets between isaac and 2mass photometry are 0.1 mag , in all bands .",
    "given the relatively small number of stars in these images , it is not possible to make a robust estimate of the completeness limit of the observations based on the statistics of the stars detected .",
    "however , a relatively good determination of the completeness limit can be obtained calculating _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath11-limit in each band . those are 20.6 in @xmath2 , 20.0 in @xmath3 , and 18.9 mag in @xmath4 .      as part of a survey of molecular gas in the third galactic quadrant",
    ", the region around the position of the iras source was mapped using the single - dish 15-m sest radiotelescope in 1999 september .",
    "the map was obtained in the rotational line of @xmath12co(1 - 0 ) ( 115.271  ghz ) and consisted of @xmath13 positions , in full - beam spacing ( @xmath14 ) , and centred on the iras coordinates .",
    "the integration time was 60 seconds .",
    "the spectra were taken in frequency switching mode , recommended to save observational time when mapping extended sources .",
    "one additional central spectrum was taken in beam - switching mode , with integration time of 120 seconds , in order to obtain improved baselines to search for the presence of molecular outflows .",
    "a high - resolution 2000 channel acousto - optical spectrometer was used as a back end , with a total bandwidth of 86  mhz and a channel width of 43  khz , which at the frequency of 115 ghz corresponds to approximately 0.11  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the antenna temperature was calibrated with the standard chopper wheel method .",
    "pointing was checked regularly towards known circumstellar sio masers , and pointing accuracy was estimated to be better than @xmath16 .",
    "the data reduction pipeline was composed of the following steps : _",
    "i ) _ folding the frequency - switched spectrum ; _ ii ) _ fitting the baseline by a polynomial and subtracting it ; _ iii ) _ obtaining the main - beam temperature @xmath17 by dividing the antenna temperature @xmath18 by the @xmath19 factor , equal to 0.7 .    the spectrum baseline rms noise ( in @xmath17 ) ,",

    "figure  [ rgb995 ] presents the vlt / isaac @xmath0 near - infrared colour composite image obtained towards iras  06345 - 3023 .",
    "centred on the image , extended nebular emission involving a few bright stars is displayed .",
    "in addition , when compared to other fields , usually at low galactic latitudes , we notice a very small number of field stars , either background or foreground , that populate the galactic disc and frequently contaminate deep near - infrared images",
    ".    a close look at the image ( see the zoomed - in view of the same region shown in figure  [ rgb995 - 1 ] ) reveals the presence of a butterfly - shaped bipolar dark cloud , to the north - northeast and to the south - southwest .",
    "notice also the bright rims of the dark `` butterfly wings '' illuminated by the central stars .",
    "the richness of the structures seen includes a quasi - circular bright ring and bright wisps or rays of light against the black opaque northern wing ( see also fig .",
    "[ rgb999 ] for the nomenclature used here ) .    in fig .",
    "[ rgb999 ] we reproduced the colour composite image using a colour coding emphasizing the bright stars as opposed to the diffuse nebular emission .",
    "a few important points can be derived as follows .",
    "the bright source labeled `` wispy neb '' is not a point source , it corresponds to pure diffuse emission .",
    "several wisps in this nebula ( better distiguished in fig .",
    "[ rgb995 - 1 ] ) seem to point away from a common point , the location of one of the reddest sources , that labeled `` irs  4 '' .",
    "the bluer colour of the wispy nebula supports the idea that it corresponds to scattered light from a cavity located close to the centre of the butterfly - shaped core where opacity is lower . in fact , the position of one of the two `` nebulous stars '' that were noticed on the optical eso / src images @xcite coincides with the position of this wispy nebula .",
    "the other optical `` nebulous star '' corresponds to the blue emission seen to the west including the circular arc ( the `` arc '' ) .",
    "this arc - like structure appears to be associated with the source labeled `` irs  3 '' which is the brightest red embedded source present in the images .",
    "the arc is quasi - circular , very well delineated , and constitutes an engimatic structure , similar to the structure seen around a few other young stellar objects .",
    "examples of these are the diamond - ring object of @xcite , which was conjectured to represent a circumbinary structure existing during a brief stage in the formation of a binary star ; and gg  tau , a multiple young source , which exhibits a circumbinary ring ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that has recently been suggested to be forming planets @xcite .",
    "irs  3 could be another case of a multiple young object denouncing its multiplicity through the presence of circumbinary arcs or rings , seen in the near - infrared or submillimetre .",
    "interestingly , neither of the two optical `` nebulous stars '' is a real star ( point source ) but instead corresponds to diffuse scattered emission escaping through lines - of - sight of lower optical depth .",
    "several cavities excavated by winds from young stars are now known and have been modelled ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our images seem to confirm the rule that young stars disrupt the parent cloud core reducing the opacity from specific lines - of - sight and resulting in very non - homogenous distributions of extinction across cloud cores . also remarkable",
    "is the detection of wisps of bluer light escaping from this star formation site , similar to sunlight under low - lying clouds on a partly cloudy day on earth .",
    "in addition , despite its faintness , a careful look reveals the presence of a bright rim of this molecular cloud core specially in the southwest part of the dark nebula ( fig .",
    "[ rgb995 - 1 ] ) .     but with a colour coding emphasizing the emission from bright stars .",
    "notice the nomenclature of the structures labeled here , some of which can be seen more clearly in fig.[rgb995 - 1],width=302 ]      we have detected co emission towards the positions of the nebular emission and of this group of stars .",
    "moreover , the location of the nebula coincides with the position where the molecular gas peaks .",
    "[ co1 ] shows the beam switching spectrum from the iras  063453023 revealing a clear detection of a co line . a gaussian fit yields a @xmath21 peak value of 8.1  k at the @xmath22 km  s@xmath15 in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "the line presents some deviation from a gaussian , exhibiting moderate wings that could be due to a molecular outflow .",
    "our @xmath23 co map ( fig .  [ comap ] ) shows relatively constant co emission , but peaking at the centre position where the iras source is located .",
    "because the map was obtained in frequency - switching mode , we did not try to look for the presence of outflows in the beams of this map .",
    "either adopting a flat rotation curve in the outer galaxy or using a circular rotation model , a heliocentric distance @xmath24  kpc , and a galactocentric distance @xmath25  kpc are found , respectively .",
    "this is in good agreement with the distance quoted by @xcite .",
    "thus , the projected size of the region occupied by the near - infrared nebula and butterfly - wings turns out to be @xmath26  pc , a typical size for a molecular cloud core , and coincident with the c@xmath27o - derived size @xcite .",
    "however , as expected , the size of the molecular cloud is much larger as can be seen by the large scale map of @xcite which covers more than @xmath28 on the sky .",
    "interestingly , due to its relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath29 ) , this source is located about 450  pc below the mid - plane of the galactic disc .",
    "this value is among the largest known for molecular clouds at this distance in the outer galaxy @xcite , placing this source at the edge of the galactic ( thin ) disc @xcite .",
    "a similar large vertical distance was found for the star formation site reported by @xcite . in that case , flaring and the location of the galactic warp could account for the presence of the star formation site . however , this is not the case for iras  06345 - 3023 .",
    "in fact , flaring of the gas component ( both hi and h@xmath30 ) in the galactic disc is known to occur but is significant only at larger galactocentric distances @xcite .",
    "thus , the present day existence of molecular gas and dust at this relatively large vertical distance raises new questions about the evolution of the galactic disc , as well as the ability to form stars in this extreme environment .      in order to determine the nature of the group of stars seen in the near - infrared images , and",
    "specially those seen towards the nebula , photometry of the stars in the @xmath0 images was performed .",
    "not many stars are seen , neither field stars ( background or foreground ) nor embedded young stars .",
    "the scarcity of field stars is due to the location of this star formation site in the outer galaxy , and about 450  pc below the galactic disc . on the other hand ,",
    "given the good resolution and depth of the images , and considering the distance , the scarcity of young stars forming in this cloud core could indicate a lack of ability to form rich clusters at this large distance below the galactic disc .",
    "table  1 presents the results of our photometry for the sources detected in the @xmath0-bands in the region shown in fig.[rgb995 - 1 ] .",
    "columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) give their coordinates .",
    "the @xmath0 magnitudes ( in the 2mass system ) are presented in columns ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , where errors are of the order of 0.10 mag . in column",
    "( 6 ) we indicate the sources that are likely to be young stellar objects according to their near - infrared @xmath31 and @xmath32 colours @xcite .",
    "the sources labeled in fig .",
    "[ rgb999 ] are indicated by their names .",
    "only nine stars are detected as young stellar object candidates and likely to be forming in this region .",
    "their near - infrared colours are compatible with class  i ysos , that is optically invisible objects still surrounded by cirumstellar discs and envelopes and frequently exhibiting modest outflows .",
    "in fact , these young stars are not optically visible ( absent in the digitized sky survey ) even though they have created regions of lower extinction through the cloud that manifest as optical nebulae .",
    "we estimate the luminosity of the brightest one ( irs  3 ) by integrating the near - infrared fluxes and the iras fluxes .",
    "the result is 41@xmath33 and it represents an upper limit for the luminosity of the brightest object in the @xmath4-band .",
    "this low value of the luminosity for a pre - main - sequence object implies that no high - mass star is present in this star formation site .    .vlt",
