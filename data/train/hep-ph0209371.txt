    "this fundamental question still can not be answered .",
    "however , already at the beginning of the 20@xmath2 century , kaluza and klein realized  @xcite that the question itself may be ill posed .",
    "it seems more appropriate to ask instead : in how many dimensions do we live ?    from the modern physics point of view , a satisfactory answer to the above question may be found within the context of string theories or within a more unifiable framework , known as @xmath3 theory .",
    "the reason is that string theories provide the only known theoretical framework within which gravity can be quantized and so undeniably plays a central rle in our endeavours of unifying all fundamental forces of nature . a consistent quantum - mechanical formulation of a string theory",
    ", however , requires the existence of additional dimensions beyond the four ones we experience in our every - day life .",
    "these new dimensions must be sufficiently small , in some appropriate sense , so as to have escaped our detection . as we will see in detail ,",
    "compactification , where additional dimensions are considered to be compact manifolds of a characteristic size @xmath4 , provides a mechanism which can successfully hide them . in the original string - theoretic considerations",
    "@xcite , the inverse length @xmath5 of the extra compact dimensions and the string mass @xmath6 turned out to be closely tied to the 4-dimensional planck mass @xmath7  tev , with all involved mass scales being of the same order .",
    "more recent studies , however , have shown  @xcite that there could still be conceivable scenarios of stringy nature where @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be lowered independently of @xmath8 by several or many orders of magnitude .",
    "taking such a realization to its natural extreme , ref .",
    "@xcite considers the radical scenario , in which @xmath6 is of order tev and represents the only fundamental scale in the universe at which unification of all forces of nature occurs .",
    "thus , the so - called gauge hierarchy problem due to the high disparity between the electroweak and the 4-dimensional planck scales can be avoided all together , as it does not appear right from the beginning .",
    "let us now try to understand why @xmath9 extra dimensions with a large radius @xmath4 can influence gravity .",
    "this question is tightly connected to the geometry of space - time . at distances small",
    "compared to @xmath4 , the gravitational potential will simply change according to the gauss law in @xmath10  dimensions , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the true gravitational scale to be distinguished from the planck scale @xmath8 . as the distance , at",
    "which gravity is probed , becomes much larger than @xmath4 , the potential will again look effectively four dimensional , i.e. @xmath14 matching the two potentials ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) to give the same answer at @xmath15 , we derive an important relation among the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath16 and @xmath4  @xcite : @xmath17 hence , the weakness of gravity , observed by today s experiments , is not due to the enormity of the planck scale @xmath8 , but thanks to the presence of a large radius @xmath4 . as a result , the true fundamental gravity scale @xmath16 is determined from  [ gauss ] and is much smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "for example , extra dimensions of size @xmath18 are needed for a gravitational scale typically of the order of a string scale @xmath6 in the tev  range .",
    "therefore , even cavendish - type experiments may potentially test the model by observing deviations from newton s law  @xcite at distances smaller than a mm .",
    "this low string - scale effective model could be embedded within e.g.type  i string theories  @xcite , where the standard model ( sm ) may be described as an intersection of @xmath19 branes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 brane description implies that the sm fields do not necessarily feel the presence of all the extra dimension , but are restricted to some subspace of the full space - time .",
    "especially mm - size dimensions , being clearly excluded for the sm by experimental evidence , are probed only by gravity . however , as such intersections may be higher - dimensional as well , in addition to gravitons the sm gauge fields could also propagate within at least a single extra dimension . here , the bounds on the compactification radius from experimental data are much more severe and @xmath4 has to be at least as small as an inverse tev . in our introductory notes , we will abandon gravity and concentrate on the embedding of the standard model in a five dimensional space - time .",
    "our main interest is to explain the basic ideas and techniques for constructing this kind of theories .",
    "note that this limited class of models with low string - scales may result in different higher - dimensional extensions of the sm  @xcite , even if gravity is completely ignored .",
    "hence , the actual experimental limits on the compactification radius are , to some extent , model dependent .",
    "in fact , most of the derived phenomenological limits in the literature were obtained by assuming that the sm gauge fields propagate all freely in a common higher - dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "therefore , towards the end of our notes , we will also discuss the phenomenological consequences of models which minimally depart from the assumption of these higher - dimensional scenarios  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will consider 5-dimensional extensions of the sm compactified on an @xmath20 orbifold , where the su(2)@xmath0 and u(1)@xmath1 gauge bosons may not both live in the same higher - dimensional space , the so - called bulk . in all our models",
    ", the sm fermions are localized on the 4-dimensional subspace , i.e.  on a 3-brane or , as it is often simply called , brane .",
    "the present introductory notes are organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ 5dqed ] we introduce the basic concepts of higher - dimensional theories in simple abelian models .",
    "after compactifying the extra dimension on a particular orbifold , @xmath20 , we obtain an effective 4-dimensional theory , which in addition to the usual sm states contains infinite towers of massive kaluza  klein ( kk ) states of the higher - dimensional gauge fields .",
    "in particular , we consider the question how to consistently quantize the higher - dimensional models under study in the so - called @xmath21 gauge .",
    "such a quantization procedure can be successfully applied to theories that include both higgs bosons living in the bulk and/or on the brane .",
    "after briefly discussing how these concepts can be applied to the sm in sect .",
    "[ minimalextensions ] , we turn our attention to the phenomenological aspects of the models of our interest in sect .",
    "[ phenomenology ] . for each higher - dimensional model",
    ", we calculate the effects of the fifth dimension on electroweak observables and lep2 cross sections and analyze their impact on constraining the compactification scale . technical details are omitted here in favour of introducing the main concepts . a complete discussion , along with detailed analytic results and an extensive list of references , is given in our paper in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we summarize in sect . [ conclusions ] our main results .",
    "as a starting point , let us consider the lagrangian of 5-dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( 5d - qed ) given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the 5-dimensional field strength tensor , and @xmath24 is the gauge - fixing term .",
    "the faddeev - popov ghost terms have been neglected , because the ghosts are non - interacting in the abelian case .",
    "our notation for the lorentz indices and space - time coordinates is : @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ; and @xmath28 denotes the coordinate of the additional dimension .",
    "the structure of the conventional qed lagrangian is simply carried over to the five - dimensional case .",
    "the field content of the theory is given by a single gauge - boson @xmath29 transforming as a vector under the lorentz group so(1,4 ) . in the absence of the gauge - fixing and ghost terms , the 5d - qed lagrangian is invariant under a u(1 ) gauge transformation @xmath30 hence , the defining features of conventional qed are present in 5d - qed as well .",
    "so far , we have treated all the spatial dimensions on the same footing .",
    "this is certainly an assumption in contradiction not only to experimental evidence but also to our daily experience .",
    "there has to be a mechanism in the theory which hides the additional dimension at low energies .",
    "as we will see in the following , the simplest approach accomplishing this goal is compactification , i.e. , replace the infinitely extended extra dimension by a compact object .",
    "a simple compact one dimensional manifold is a circle , denoted by @xmath31 , with radius @xmath4 . asking for an additional reflection symmetry @xmath32 with respect to the origin @xmath33 , one",
    "is led to the orbifold @xmath20 which turns out to be especially well suited for higher dimensional physics .",
    "thus , we consider the extra dimensional coordinate @xmath34 to run only from 0 to @xmath35 where these two points are identified . moreover , according to the @xmath32 symmetry , @xmath34 and @xmath36 can be identified in a certain sense : knowing the field content for the segment @xmath37 $ ] implies the knowledge of the whole system .",
    "for that reason , the fixed points @xmath33 and @xmath38 , which do not transform under @xmath32 , are also called boundaries of the orbifold .",
    "the compactification on @xmath20 reflects itself in certain restrictions for the fields . in order not to spoil the above property of gauge symmetry",
    ", we demand the fields to satisfy the following equalities : @xmath39 the field @xmath40 is taken to be even under @xmath32 , so as to embed conventional qed with a massless photon into our 5d - qed , as we will see below .",
    "notice that the reflection properties of the field @xmath41 and the gauge parameter @xmath42 under @xmath32 in ( [ fieldconstraints ] ) follow automatically if the theory is to remain gauge invariant after compactification .    making the periodicity and reflection properties of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in  ( [ fieldconstraints ] ) explicit",
    ", we can expand these quantities in fourier series @xmath45 the fourier coefficients @xmath46 are the so - called kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes .",
    "the extra component of the gauge field is odd under the reflection symmetry and its expansion is given by @xmath47 note that there is no zero mode , a phenomenologically important fact , as we will see below .    at this point ,",
    "the theory is again formulated entirely in terms of four - dimensional fields , the kk modes .",
    "all the dependence of the lagrangian density on the extra coordinate @xmath34 is parameterized with simple fourier functions .",
    "finally , the physics is dictated by the lagrangian anyway , not by its density , thus , one can go one step further and completely remove the explicit @xmath34 dependence of the lagrangian by integrating out the extra dimension . from now on ,",
    "the quantity of interest will be @xmath48 all the higher - dimensional physics is reflected by the infinite tower of kk modes for each field component .",
    "a simple calculation yields the 4-dimensional lagrangian @xmath49\\ : + \\ :   { \\mathcal l}_{\\mathrm{gf}}(x ) \\",
    ", , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is defined in analogy to ( [ integration ] ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ labeforegf ] ) represents conventional qed involving the massless field @xmath51 . note",
    "that all the other vector excitations @xmath52 from the infinite tower of kk modes come with mass terms , their mass being an integer multiple of the inverse compactification radius .",
    "therefore , a small radius leads to a large mass or compactification scale @xmath53 in the model .",
    "it is this large scale which is responsible for the fact that an extra dimension , as it may exist , has not yet been discovered .",
    "the extra dimension is , so to speak , hidden by its compactness .",
    "note that it is the absence of @xmath54 due to the odd @xmath32 symmetry of @xmath55 which allows us to recover conventional qed in the low energy limit of the model . for @xmath56 , the kk tower @xmath57 for the additional component of the five dimensional vector field mixes with the vector modes .",
    "the modes @xmath57 , being scalars with respect to the four dimensional lorentz group , play the rle of the would - be goldstone modes in a non - linear realization of an abelian higgs model , in which the corresponding higgs fields are taken to be infinitely massive .",
    "thus , one is tempted to view the mass generation for the heavy kk modes by compactification as a kind of geometric higgs mechanism .",
    "note , moreover , that the lagrangian ( [ labeforegf ] ) is still manifestly gauge invariant under the transformation ( [ gaugetrf ] ) which in terms of the kk modes reads @xmath58    the above observations motivate us to seek for a higher - dimensional generalization of t - hooft s gauge - fixing condition , for which the mixing terms bilinear in @xmath52 and @xmath57 are eliminated from the effective 4-dimensional lagrangian  ( [ labeforegf ] ) .",
    "taking advantage of the fact that orbifold compactification generally breaks so(1,4 ) invariance  @xcite , one can abandon the requirement of covariance of the gauge fixing condition with respect to the extra dimension and choose the following non - covariant generalized @xmath21 gauge @xcite : @xmath59 nevertheless , the gauge - fixing term in ( [ gengaugefixterm ] ) is still invariant under ordinary 4-dimensional lorentz transformations . upon integration over the extra dimension ,",
    "all mixing terms in ( [ labeforegf ] ) drop out up to irrelevant total derivatives .",
    "thus , the gauge - fixed four dimensional lagrangian of the 5-dimensional qed explicitly shows the different degrees of freedom in the model .",
    "it reads @xmath60\\\\ & \\quad \\quad + \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty } \\ , \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\ ,   ( \\partial^{\\mu } a_{(n ) 5 } ) \\ , ( \\partial_{\\mu } a_{(n ) 5 } ) \\ , - \\ ,    \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\xi",
    "\\ , \\left ( \\ , \\frac{n}{r } \\ , \\right)^2 \\ , a_{(n ) 5 } \\ , ^2 \\right ] \\ , . \\end{split}\\ ] ] gauge fixed qed is accompanied with a tower of its massive copies .",
    "the scalars @xmath61 with gauge dependent masses resemble the would - be goldstone bosons of an ordinary 4-dimensional abelian - higgs model in the @xmath21 gauge . from this lagrangian ,",
    "it is obvious that the corresponding propagators take on their usual forms : @xmath62{figure_in_text.eps}\\ ] ] hereafter , we shall refer to the @xmath57 fields as goldstone modes .",
    "having defined the appropriate @xmath21 gauge through the gauge - fixing term in  ( [ gengaugefixterm ] ) , we can recover the usual unitary gauge , in which the goldstone modes decouple from the theory , in the limit @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "thus , for the case at hand , we have seen how starting from a non - covariant higher - dimensional gauge - fixing condition , we can arrive at the known covariant 4-dimensional @xmath21 gauge after compactification .",
    "having established a five dimensional gauge sector , we can now introduce fermions in the model .",
    "this is possible in the same spirit followed for the gauge field , leading to bulk fermions , i.e. fermions propagating into the extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out , that there is an even easier and phenomenologically challenging alternative to this approach .",
    "moreover , problems with chiral fermions in five dimensions , to be included in more realistic theories , can be avoided .",
    "the @xmath20 orbifold , as noted above , has the peculiar feature that there are fixed points @xmath64 and @xmath65 not transforming under the @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "these special points can be considered as so - called branes hosting localized fields which can not penetrate the extra dimension .",
    "this concept can be easily formalized by introducing a @xmath66-function in the lagrangian for the fermions , i.e. @xmath67 where the covariant derivative @xmath68 contains the bulk gauge field and @xmath69 denotes the coupling constant of 5d - qed .",
    "the obvious generalization for the usual gauge - transformation properties of fermion fields reads @xmath70 again integrating out the fifth dimension , we are left with an effective four dimensional interaction lagrangian @xmath71 coupling all the kk modes to the fermion field on the brane .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath72 is the qed coupling constant as measured by experiment .",
    "the factor @xmath73 in ( [ interactionsfermwithgbmodesabelianmodel ] ) is a typical enhancement factor for the coupling of brane fields to heavy kk modes .",
    "note that the scaler modes @xmath74 do not couple at all to brane fermions because their wave functions vanish at @xmath33 according to the odd @xmath32-symmetry .",
    "these interaction terms together with completely standard kinetic terms for the fermion field complete 5d - qed .",
    "the corresponding feynman rules for the electron - photon vertex and the analogous interaction of the kk modes are shown in fig .",
    "[ qedvertices ] .",
    "feynman rules for the vertices in 5d - qed , width=340 ]    if nature were described by qed up to energies probed so far by experiment an experimental signature of this five dimensional extension would be , e.g. , a series of @xmath75-channel resonances in muon - pair production at an @xmath76-collider as shown in fig .",
    "[ crosssection ] . even though nature is not described by qed only , the generic signatures of extra dimensions are quite similar to those in more realistic theories .    the above quantization procedure can now be extended to more elaborate higher - dimensional models . if we want to extend the standard model by an extra dimension we have to understand spontaneous symmetry breaking in this context .",
    "hence , adding a higgs scalar in the bulk , the 5d lagrangian of the theory reads @xmath77 where @xmath78 again denotes the covariant derivative ( [ covderin5dqed ] ) , @xmath69 the 5-dimensional gauge coupling , @xmath79 a 5-dimensional complex scalar field , and @xmath80 ( with @xmath81 ) the 5-dimensional higgs potential .",

    "the width of the kk modes has been reasonably approximated , width=340 ]    the vev introduces an additional mass term for each kk mode of the gauge fields .",
    "the zero mode turns from a massless to a massive degree of freedom , as usual for the higgs mechanism .",
    "all the higher kk masses are slightly shifted .",
    "the gauge and self interactions of the higgs fields , omitted in ( [ kintermsforhiggsinabmodel ] ) , only involve bulk fields , in contrast to the photon - fermion interaction introduced before .",

    "hence , @xmath141 is the only additional free parameter introduced in the model .",
    "the chiral structure of the standard model can be easily incorporated as long as one only considers fermions restricted to a brane .",
    "a simple extension of ( [ interactionsfermwithgbmodesabelianmodel ] ) leads to @xmath142 where @xmath43 generically denotes some gauge boson and g the respective coupling constant .",
    "the coupling parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 are set by the electroweak quantum numbers of the fermions and receive their sm values . because the kk mass eigenmodes @xmath145 generally differ from the fourier modes @xmath120 in ( [ genericfermionint ] ) , as we have seen before , their couplings to fermions @xmath146 and @xmath147 have to be individually calculated for each model .",
    "the photon and its possible kk modes are not affected by spontaneous symmetry breaking and keep their simple couplings , already presented in fig . [ qedvertices ] . for the bulk - bulk model ,",
    "the shifts in the vector and axial - vector couplings of the @xmath134 boson are actually the same , such that it is sufficient to replace the su(2 ) coupling constant @xmath148 by @xmath149 for each kk mode , in analogy to the abelian higgs model .",
    "the mass generation in the yukawa sector , involving brane fermions , hardly changes at all .",
    "an even more minimal 5-dimensional extension of electroweak physics constitutes a model in which only the u(1)@xmath1 -sector feels the extra dimension while the su(2)@xmath0 gauge fields are localized at @xmath33 ( brane - bulk model ) .",

    "the @xmath153 bosons are brane fields and their physics is completely sm - like . in this case , the higgs field being charged with respect to both gauge groups has to be localized at @xmath33 in order to preserve gauge invariance of the ( classical ) lagrangian .",
    "a gauge field on the brane can not compensate the variation of a higgs field under gauge transformations in the whole bulk .",
    "for the same reason , a bulk higgs is forbidden in the third possible model in which u(1)@xmath1 is localized while su(2)@xmath0 propagates in the fifth dimension ( bulk - brane model ) , i.e. , the gauge groups interchange their rle .",
    "consequently , the @xmath153 bosons are bulk fields and are described in analogy to the models discussed in sect .",
    "[ 5dqed ] . in both models , after spontaneous symmetry breaking , there is a single massless gauge field protected by the residual unbroken gauge symmetry , the photon .",
    "a second light neutral mode can be identified with the @xmath134 boson . however , in contrast to the bulk - bulk model , there is only a single neutral tower of heavy kk modes .",
    "up to small admixtures due to the brane vev ( see sect . [ 5dqed ] ) , it mainly contains the u(1)@xmath154 or the neutral su(2)@xmath155 gauge field , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , for simplicity , we will refer to it as @xmath134-boson kk tower .",
    "note , however , that @xmath146 and @xmath147 in ( [ genericfermionint ] ) are affected differently for the @xmath134-boson and its kk modes",
    ". most easily they are parameterized by introducing effective quantum numbers @xmath156 and @xmath157 to absorb all the higher - dimensional effects .",

    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we relate the sm prediction @xmath160  @xcite for an observable to the prediction @xmath161 for the same observable obtained in the higher - dimensional sm under investigation through @xmath162 here , @xmath163 is the tree - level modification of a given observable @xmath164 from its sm value due to the presence of one extra dimension .",
    "the tree - level modifications can be expanded in powers of the typical scale factor @xmath165 we work to first order in @xmath166 being a very good approximation for phenomenologically viable compactification scales in the tev region . on the other hand , to enable a direct comparison of our predictions with precise data  @xcite , we include sm radiative corrections to  @xmath160 .",
    "however , we neglect sm- as well as kk - loop contributions to @xmath167 as higher order effects .    as input sm parameters for our numerical predictions",
    ", we choose the most accurately measured ones , namely the @xmath134-boson mass @xmath168 , the electromagnetic fine structure constant  @xmath169 , and the fermi constant @xmath170 .",
    "while @xmath169 is not affected in the models under study , @xmath171 , the mass of the lightest mode in the @xmath134 boson kk tower , generally deviates from its sm form , where we have @xmath172 at tree level .",
    "to first order in @xmath166 , @xmath173 may be parameterized by @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a model - dependent parameter . for the bulk - bulk ,",
    "brane - bulk and bulk - brane models with respect to the su(2)@xmath0 and u(1)@xmath1 gauge groups , @xmath175 is given by @xmath176 where @xmath177 is an effective weak mixing angle to be introduced below in ( [ effmixinganle ] ) .",
    "these shifts in the @xmath134-boson mass are induced by the vev of a brane higgs .",

    "the @xmath189-channel exchange also has to be taken into account , however , there are no fundamental differences .",
    "the above parameterization for the cross section is particularly convenient because it clearly separates the higher - dimensional effects from well known physics .",
    "all the higher - dimensional physics manifests itself in the effective sum of s - channel propagators ( [ effprop ] ) differing with respect to the standard model .    from ( [ diffcrosssection ] )",
    ", we calculate @xmath163 for the different fermion - pair production channels at lep2 energies and finally the bounds shown in table [ fermiondata ] . in table [ combineddata ] , all the bounds are combined for final lower limits on the compactification scale .",
    "the bounds for the brane - bulk and the bulk - brane models from lep1 and lep2 observables are kind of complementary , such that the combined limit is larger than 4  tev in both models .",
    "the compactification scale for the bulk - bulk model , no matter where the higgs lives , is still more restricted to lie above 6  tev at the @xmath190 confidence level .",
    "the aim of the present notes has been to give an introduction to the model - building of low - energy 5-dimensional electroweak models .",
    "we have derived step by step the corresponding four dimensional theory by compactifying on the orbifold @xmath20 and by integrating out the extra dimension .",
    "we have paid special attention to consistently quantize the higher - dimensional models in the generalized @xmath21 gauges .",
    "the 5-dimensional @xmath21 gauge fixing conditions introduced here lead , after compactification , to a 4-dimensional lagrangian in the standard @xmath21 gauge for each kk mode .",
    "the latter also clarifies the rle of the different degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the main advantages of our gauge - fixing procedure is that one can now derive manifest gauge - independent analytic expressions for the kk - mass spectrum of the gauge bosons and for their interactions to the fermionic matter .",
    "most importantly , one may even apply an analogous gauge - fixing approach to spontaneous symmetry breaking theories .    to render the topics under discussion more intuitive",
    ", we have analyzed all the main ideas in simple abelian toy models .",
    "however , we have pointed out how to generalize these ideas to new possible 5-dimensional extensions of the sm in which the su(2)@xmath0 and u(1)@xmath1 gauge fields and higgs bosons may or may not all experience the presence of the fifth dimension .",
    "the fermions in all the models are considered to be confined to one of the two boundaries of the @xmath20 orbifold .    after introducing a framework for deriving predictions of possible observables ,",
    "we have given a glimpse of higher - dimensional phenomenology .",
    "electroweak precision observables are considered as well as cross sections for fermion - pair production at lep2 . in particular ,",
    "we have presented bounds on the compactification scale @xmath191 in three different 5-dimensional extensions of the sm : ( i )  the su(2)@xmath192u(1)@xmath1-bulk model , where all sm gauge bosons are bulk fields ; ( ii ) the su(2)@xmath0-brane , u(1)@xmath1-bulk model , where only the @xmath153 bosons are restricted to the brane , and ( iii )  the su(2)@xmath0-bulk , u(1)@xmath1-brane model , where only the u(1)@xmath1 gauge field is confined to the brane .",
    "for the often - discussed first model , we find the 2@xmath158 lower bounds on @xmath3 : @xmath193  and 6.1  tev , for a higgs boson living in the bulk and on the brane , respectively .",
    "for the second and third models , the corresponding 2@xmath158 lower limits are 4.7  and 4.3  tev .",
    "hence , the bounds for different models can differ significantly .",
    "any non - stringy field - theoretic treatment of higher - dimensional theories , as the one presented here , involves a number of assumptions .",
    "although the results obtained in the higher - dimensional models with one compact dimension are convergent at the tree level , they become divergent if more than one extra dimensions are considered . also , the analytic results are ultra - violet ( uv ) divergent at the quantum level , since the higher - dimensional theories are not renormalizable . within a string - theoretic framework ,",
    "the above uv divergences are expected to be regularized by the string mass scale @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , from an effective field - theory point of view , the phenomenological predictions will depend to some extend on the uv cut - off procedure  @xcite related to the string scale @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , assuming validity of perturbation theory , we expect that quantum corrections due to extra dimensions will not exceed the 10% level of the tree - level effects we have been studying here . finally , we have ignored possible model - dependent winding - number contributions  @xcite and radiative brane effects  @xcite that might also affect to some degree our phenomenological predictions .    the lower limits on the compactification scale derived by the present global analysis indicate that resonant production of the first kk state may be at the edge of accessibility at the lhc , at which heavy kk masses up to 67  tev  @xcite might be explored .",
    "hence , the phenomenological analysis has to be carried further in order to be able to discriminate possible higher - dimensional signals from other standard model extensions .                    n. arkani - hamed , s. dimopoulos , g. dvali : phys .",
