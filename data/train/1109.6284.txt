    "is suggested by considering the geometry of our sample , see fig .",
    "[ fig - c ] .",
    "an estimate of the capacitance across the graphene sheet can be found with the help of the formula for coplanar electrodes  @xcite : @xmath126 , which leads us to the conclusion that the electrode capacitance should be @xmath127 ff . here @xmath128 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath129 is the relative permittivity of silicon @xmath130 ,",
    "@xmath131 is the junction width @xmath132 m , and @xmath133 is the complete elliptical integral of modulus @xmath134 ; @xmath135 is the distance between electrodes .",

    "[ fig - c]b gives the proper geometry and electrical scheme for the calculation of the full capacitance across the junction . in this geometry , @xmath124 is @xmath136 nm , and the area of each electrode ( including the presence of a pressed indium dot to facilitate the electrical connection to the pins on the chip carrier ) is @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xmath139m@xmath140 .",
    "thus the capacitance of each electrode to the gate is @xmath141 and @xmath142 pf , which is calculated from the formula @xmath143 , where @xmath124 is the distance to the substrate . using the circuit scheme as in fig .",
    "[ fig - c]c , the total capacitance @xmath144 is found to be @xmath145pf , which is in between the values that can be determined from the quality factor argument .",
    "indeed , for @xmath146 mk , the quality factor was found to vary between 3.5 and 4.2 for the entire range of gate voltages from the values of @xmath34 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus the sgs junction ( sample 105 ) is moderately underdamped as it is larger than 0.84 . since the quality factor is @xmath147 where @xmath148 , we calculate that the capacitance of the sample varies between 12 pf and 50 pf .",

    "the red color is zero differential resistance while the green is the normal state resistance .",
    "this plot also shows the expected fraunhofer pattern.,title=\"fig:\",width=302]-.65 cm      _ characterization of graphene proximity junctions_. in this section , the basic characterization of the electronic transport properties of graphene proximity junctions will be presented .",

    "this discussion complements presentation given in the main text .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the switching current can be measured and compared to josephson junction theory .",

    "[ fig1]d of the main text , where a good fit is obtained using an area that is estimated from the junction area of @xmath155 m@xmath140 , which results in a magnetic field period of @xmath156 mt .",
    "a vertical shift of @xmath157 ma was also used to obtain the fit to account for the supercurrent observed even at the dirac point . the magnetic field period obtained from the experimental data",
    "is somewhat small at about @xmath158 mt . this discrepancy between the fitted and measured value can be traced to an understanding of the effective area of the junction @xmath159 .",
    "using a penetration depth of @xmath160 nm results in an effect area of @xmath161 m@xmath140 and a magnetic field period of @xmath162 mt . if the area of the entire electrode plus junction were used , the magnetic field period would be @xmath163 mt .",
    "thus , to fit to the fraunhofer period the penetration depth in our samples should be larger than @xmath160 nm in order to increase the effective area of the junction .",
    "the differential resistance of the junction can also be measured as a function of bias current and magnetic field , see fig .",

    ", the switching current is expected to increase as well , which is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig - dvdi]a .",
    "similarly , the retrapping current increases as well . in addition , the resistance of the sample decreases as the carrier concentration increases . in fig .",

    "thus , this figure confirms that our junctions are capable of carrying a bipolar supercurrent .",
