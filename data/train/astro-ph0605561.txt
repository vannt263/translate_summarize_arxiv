    "in the early 1980s , surveys of normal galaxies with the einstein x - ray satellite revealed intermediate - luminosity ( l@xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath7@xmath810@xmath9 erg  s@xmath10 ) x - ray sources which were seemingly located in the centers of spiral galaxies ( fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "this was very interesting , since seyfert nuclei ( active galactic nuclei [ agns ] in nearby spirals ) are typically much more luminous ( l@xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath11@xmath810@xmath12 erg  s@xmath10 ) and black hole x - ray binaries ( bh xrbs ) are much less luminous ( typically l@xmath5 @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg  s@xmath10 ) . it was not clear whether these intriguing sources were underluminous accreting supermassive bhs , overluminous xrbs located near the galactic nucleus , or an entirely new type of astrophysical object altogether ( e.g. , colbert et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the 1990s ,",
    "rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) observations showed that these ultraluminous x - ray objects ( ulxs ; also known as intermediate - luminosity x - ray objects , or ixos ) are compact x - ray sources , and are quite common in the local universe ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; roberts & warwick 2000 ) .",
    "many ulxs were found to be offset from the optical nucleus ( e.g. , colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "more complete surveys from rosat ( e.g. , roberts & warwick 2000 ; colbert & ptak 2002 ) and chandra imaging data place their frequency of occurrence at about one in every five galaxies ( ptak & colbert 2004 ) .",
    "most of the ulxs found in these surveys are clearly significantly displaced from the galactic nuclei , implying that their masses must be @xmath1310@xmath15 m@xmath16 since dynamical friction would otherwise cause them to sink to the center of the galaxy in a hubble time ( tremaine , ostriker & spitzer 1975 ) .",
    "ulxs are generally unresolved at the high spatial resolution ( @xmath17 ) of chandra , and many show variability ( colbert & ptak 2002 ; fabbiano et al .  2003 ) , which rules out the hypothesis that ulxs are closely - spaced aggregates of lower - luminosity x - ray sources .",
    "bondi accretion from a dense ism may not be sufficient to explain the observed luminosities ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) , although an intermediate mass black hole ( @xmath18 ) in a dense molecular cloud may achieve luminosities in excess of @xmath19 ( krolik 2004 ) .",
    "they are therefore most likely powered by accretion in binary systems .",
    "this is supported by evidence for periodicity in a few individual objects ( sugiho et al .",
    "2001 ; liu et al .",
    "if one assumes that ulxs have l@xmath5 below the eddington luminosity and are not beamed , then the mass of the central object is required to be in the range @xmath20 .",
    "this is too massive to be a neutron star or a black hole formed through normal stellar evolution , thus we would have to be dealing with intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "this interpretation is quite fascinating , as reviewed by van der marel ( 2004 ) and miller & colbert ( 2004 ) .",
    "for some individual ulxs it has been argued that the presence of an imbh is plausible ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) , but in general it poses many challenges from a theoretical point of view ( see king et al .  2001 ;",
    "king 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , ulxs may instead be stellar - mass black hole systems that are emitting anisotropically with either mild ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) or relativistic beaming ( krding , falcke & markoff 2002 ) , or are actually emitting at super - eddington rates ( begelman 2002 ; grimm , gilfanov & sunyaev 2002 ) .",
    "for example , the galactic microquasar grs 1915 has a known black hole mass of @xmath21 and is often observed with x - ray luminosities exceeding @xmath22 , qualifying it as an ulx . in this case",
    "the high luminosity is due to both relativistic beaming and super - eddington emission ( king 2002 ; mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) .",
    "phenomenologically there appear to be several breeds of ulxs .",
    "they may be preferentially found in star - forming galaxies ( kilgard et al .  2002 ; grimm et al .",
    "2003 ) , with starburst galaxies such as the antennae ( zezas et al .  2002 ; zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) and the cartwheel ( gao et al .",
    "2003 ) having large numbers of ulxs .",
    "this suggests an association between the incidence of ulxs and star formation ( although ptak & colbert [ 2004 ] have found that this is not necessarily the case in general ) .",
    "indeed , optical counterparts reported for ulxs suggest a young star cluster in one case ( goad et al .",
    "2002 ) and a single o - star in another case ( liu , bregman & seitzer 2002a ) .",
    "@xcite discuss a study of optical counterparts to ulxs in m51 and varyingly find no , one or several candidate counterparts .",
    "the colors and absolute magnitudes of counterparts in several cases ( where there were only one or two counterparts ) were consistent with stars of mass 7 - 9 @xmath23 and 10 - 15 @xmath23 , implying that these ulxs may be high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "a radio counterpart was found for a ulx in the dwarf galaxy ngc 5408 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) , with two possible hst counterparts in the x - ray error circle .",
    "the brighter of these counterparts has @xmath24 , consistent with a supergiant o star .",
    "ulxs have also been found in elliptical galaxies and galactic bulges ( colbert & ptak 2002 ; angelini et al .",
    "2001 ; wu et al .  2002 ; jeltema et al .  2003 ) .",
    "this suggests that some ulxs are associated with old systems such as globular clusters .",
    "however , ulxs with @xmath25 found in ellipticals are often not associated with globular clusters and are observed in numbers consistent with the expected number of background sources ( irwin et al .",
    "a study of optical counterparts to four ulxs by gutierrez ( 2006 ) found that three are background agn and one is likely to be foreground star .",
    "three of these ulxs were found in early - type galaxies , again showing a tendency for ulxs associated with early - type galaxies to be background agn .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy can give clues about accretion disks and coronae that may be present in ulxs ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; makishima et al .",
    "2000 ; roberts et al .  2001 ; strickland et al .  2001 ; zezas et al .  2002 ; foschini et al",
    "2002 ; miller et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , there are important questions about the nature of ulxs that can only be answered using the multi - wavelength properties of as large a sample of ulxs as possible . in the antennae , ulxs",
    "are often observed close to star clusters , but not coincident with them .",
    "this may suggest a scenario in which ulxs are x - ray binaries that can be ejected out of clusters through recoil ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) .",
    "if this is generally true then it would preclude an imbh because the mass would be too large for the binary to be ejected ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) . in cases",
    "where individual counterparts are not detected learning about the environment of the ulxs can also be instructive . for example , it has been suggested that ulxs in late - type galaxies are preferentially found in or near hii regions ( pakull & mirioni 2002 ) .",
    "we have established a pipeline to continuously analyze chandra data from galaxies as it becomes publicly available , with emphasis on producing a catalog of ulxs .",
    "the present paper presents a study of archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) images obtained with the second wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) of fields that contain ulxs in our chandra catalog .",
    "the goal is to search for optical counterparts to the ulxs , and to characterize their environment .",
    "while a few individual optical ulx counterparts have been reported by other groups , the present work represents the first large - scale chandra / hst ulx cross - comparison and cataloging effort .",
    "the use of hst data is critical , given that ground - based observations do not have the spatial resolution to resolve individual stars ( unless the star is unusually isolated ) and often can not reach the apparent magnitudes of even supergiant stars except for the nearest galaxies .",
    "the results provide much improved statistics with fewer biases than previous work , as well as a catalog of sources for use in follow - up studies .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ s : sample ] discusses the sample selection and the chandra and hst data that we have used for the study .",
    "section  [ s : astrocor ] discusses the astrometric registration of the chandra and hst data .",
    "section  [ s : photometry ] discusses the results from photometric analysis on the potential counterparts that were located .",
    "section  [ s : discuss ] discusses the main results of the study , and the implications for our understanding of ulxs .",
    "section  [ s : conc ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "we searched for chandra x - ray sources within the r@xmath26 radius of all galaxies in the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) with recessional velocities @xmath27 5000 km  s@xmath10 . here",
    "r@xmath26 is the 25 mag  arcsec@xmath28 isophotal diameter , as listed in rc3 .",
    "an x - ray point source database was created with the xassist ( ptak & griffith 2003 ) chandra acis pipeline , using all public acis data as of 17  july  2002 .",
    "ulxs were selected by requiring a 2@xmath810 kev x - ray luminosity l@xmath29 10@xmath30 erg  s@xmath10 , assuming an absorbed power - law model with galactic absorption ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and photon index @xmath31 1.7 . for galaxies with rc3 recessional velocities @xmath27 1000 km  s@xmath10 ,",
    "distances were taken from tully ( 1988 ) , if available , otherwise from kraan - kortewag & tamman ( 1979 ) .",
    "distances to galaxies with @xmath32 1000 km  s@xmath10 were computed using h@xmath33 75 km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 ( for consistency with tully 1988 ) .",
    "h  i line velocities from rc3 were used when available , otherwise `` optical '' rc3 velocities were used .",
    "the preliminary source list thus obtained was tapered by merging duplicate sources and examining the individual x - ray images to verify that the source was not an x - ray instrumental artifact and that it was indeed point - like .",
    "we next cross - correlated the x - ray positions with known sources listed in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) to identify known agns , galaxy nuclei , and x - ray supernovae .",
    "any objects thus identified were omitted , and questionable objects were flagged as such .",
    "the remaining list contained 125 ulxs , which were used as a starting point for searching the hst wfpc2 archive using the selection criteria discussed in section  [ ss : hstdata ] .",
    "for those ulxs with wfpc2 data that passed our search criteria , we performed an astrometric registration as described in section  [ s : astrocor ] . with more accurate absolute positions available , we reexamined all of the questionable objects by checking their x - ray position with respect to the galaxy nucleus in the wfpc2 images , and by rejecting sources when spatially coincident with known agns or sne .",
    "this ultimately yielded 44 ulxs in 25 different galaxies , that make up our sample for this paper .",

    "associations are logically related sets of individual wfpc2 images ( e.g. the same field , filter , and orientation ) with accompanying information on positional offsets between the images . the vast majority of wfpc2 science data ( 93% ) has been made into associations ( micol & durand 2002 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 associations science products pipeline ( waspp ) produces data products from the images in an association . to this end",
    "it starts by applying the regular wfpc2 pipeline calibration steps ( bias subtraction , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , etc . ) to the individual images of the association .",
    "the reduced images are then registered and co - added with cosmic - ray rejection . if reference stars from the usno - a2.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ) are present in the field , then these are identified by an automated algorithm and the final combined image is registered to their reference frame . for the present project we used the data made available in the first release ( november 6 , 2002 ) of the waspp association data .",
    "this release contained data products for 66% of all wfpc2 associations .",
    "we searched the stsci hst data archive for wfpc2 images with pointings that might include the ulxs that were identified with chandra ( section  [ ss : chadracat ] ) . each wfpc2 field",
    "was then visually inspected to ensure that the ulx position fell on one of the wfpc2 chips .",
    "fields in which the ulx position was located off the edge of the wfpc2 detectors were eliminated . of these images ,",
    "90% was part of an association .",
    "each association typically contains 28 images .",
    "of these associations , 74% had been processed by the waspp at the time of the first data release .",
    "this implies that two - thirds of all the images that we could have used for the present study were part of the first waspp release .",
    "since manual registration and co - addition of the remaining one - third would have been a substantial effort while providing only a modest increases in overall sample size , we decided to ignore these data for the present study .",
    "the final wfpc2 data sample thus obtained consists of 76 wfpc2 images that include the 44 ulxs in our chandra catalog .",
    "each wfpc2 image is a fully calibrated association data product . for a detailed description of the waspp data reduction steps",
    "we refer the reader to schade et al .",
    "the wfpc2 association products used in our study are listed in table  2 , together with basic properties such as the filter used and the total exposure time .",
    "for some of our ulxs we have images in multiple filters , or even multiple images in the same filter ( the waspp pipeline does not combine images taken at different epochs and telescope orientation , even when taken with the same filter ) .",
    "it is important for our study that the hst and chandra data are astrometrically aligned as well as possible .",
    "the absolute astrometric accuracy of wfpc2 data is dominated by two components .",
    "the first is the @xmath34 rms astrometric accuracy of the guide star catalog , which is used for pointing and guiding .",
    "the second is the accuracy with which the relative positions of the wfpc2 and the fine guidance sensors in the focal plane are known .",
    "the latter effect dominates the overall error budget , although its actual size has varied over the wfpc2 lifetime ( brammer et al .",
    "2002 ) . by comparing the positions of usno - a2.0 stars in large numbers of wfpc2 images to their known astrometric coordinates , schade et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found an overall rms astrometric accuracy for wfpc2 data of @xmath35 .",
    "by contrast , chandra has nominal 90% and 99% confidence astrometric accuracies of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( aldcroft 2002 ) .",
    "the waspp association products have the advantage that they have significantly enhanced astrometric accuracy as compared to the nominal wfpc2 accuracy .",
    "the waspp pipeline identifies all stars in the usno - a2.0 catalog that might be on the image , and searches for correspondence between the catalog and observed bright sources .",
    "the results are used to improve the astrometry of the association data products . in principle",
    "the final astrometric accuracy could be as good as that of the usno - a2.0 catalog , which has a nominal rms accuracy of @xmath38 . in practice , however , there are several caveats to this .",
    "first , the usno - a2.0 catalog has epochs in the 1950s , and accumulated proper motions bring the current rms accuracy into the range @xmath39@xmath40 ( schade et al .",
    "second , not all fields have ( identifiable ) usno - a2.0 stars , and for these fields the association data products have the same @xmath35 rms astrometric accuracy as regular pipeline - calibrated wfpc2 data .",
    "and third , the nearby galaxies of interest for the present study generally fill the field of view and have complicated morphology . in this case",
    "the automated source detection software in waspp may identify the wrong source with a usno - a2.0 star , and thereby significantly degrade the astrometry of the image . in our sample",
    "we found several cases for which this appeared to have happened .",
    "many galaxy nuclei are themselves contained in the usno - a2.0 catalog , and due to their complicated nuclear morphologies these are particularly tricky to use in any astrometric registration .",
    "because of these partial shortcomings of the waspp astrometric registration algorithm , we did not use its results .",
    "instead , we visually identified stars from the usno - b1.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) in the association data products , and used them to improve the astrometry . while usno - a was a two - color , one - epoch catalog , usno - b instead is a three - color , two - epoch catalog .",
    "the main advantage in the present context is that proper motions are included in the catalog , and can hence be corrected for .",
    "the nominal rms accuracy of the catalog is @xmath41 .",
    "note that mosaics produced using the stsdas task wmosaic were used , which removes known relative rotations and geometric distortions of the individual wpfc2 chips .",
    "the relative astrometry between wfpc2 positions should then be good to better than 0.1  .",
    "the advantage of our visual identification of the stars is that it avoids the potential errors that an automated algorithm could make .",
    "this approach allowed us to correct the astrometry of 34 of our 76 images . for the remaining 30 images",
    "there were no usable usno - b1.0 stars in the field ( and in general , the waspp pipeline had not identified any usno - a2.0 stars either ) . in these cases",
    "we left the astrometry as contained in the header of the original ( pre - association ) lead image which came out of the stsci on - the - fly - recalibration ( otfr ) pipeline .",
    "for the purpose of the present study we are not really interested in the absolute astrometry of either the chandra or the wfpc2 data itself , but rather in the relative astrometric accuracy between the two .",
    "it is possible to increase this accuracy in those cases where the wfpc2 field contains a known x - ray source that also emits at optical wavelengths ( other than the ulx itself ) .",
    "this is the case if the galaxy nucleus is a point - like agn , and if the nucleus is not obscured by dust in the wfpc2 image .",
    "we found this to be the case in 27 of the images , corresponding to half of all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "this high fraction reflects the fact that the chandra and/or hst observers tend to bias their observations towards active galaxies .    with the aforementioned approaches we obtained three types of wfpc2 header",
    "coordinates : method 1 coordinates ( available for 27 images ) were shifted to align the galaxy nucleus with the agn coordinates in chandra data ; method 2 coordinates ( available for 46 images ) were shifted to align observed usno - b1.0 stars with their catalog coordinates ; and method 3 coordinates ( available for all 76 images ) contain the original astrometry from the telescope .",
    "these methods are listed in order of decreasing accuracy . for our final analysis , we adopt for each image the coordinates from the lowest method number available , as listed in table  2 .",
    "out of 76 images total , 27 images have coordinates from method 1 , 34 images have coordinates from method 2 , and 15 images have coordinates from method 3 .",
    "table  2 also lists for each image the final pixel position of each ulx .",
    "together with the ra and dec values of the ulxs listed in table  [ t : sample ] this uniquely defines the astrometry of each image .",
    "note that our overall approach focuses on relative astrometry and not absolute astrometry .",
    "in particular , when we register wfpc2 data to the chandra frame in method 1 we improve the relative astrometry , but not necessarily the absolute astrometry .",
    "the relative accuracy of the coordinates from the different methods can be analyzed with some simple statistics .",
    "let @xmath42 be the rms ( two - dimensional ) distance between the coordinates from methods @xmath43 and @xmath44 , for those images that have coordinates available from both methods .",
    "we find for our sample : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we can safely assume that method 1 yields much better relative chandra / hst alignment than method 2 .",
    "this implies that @xmath48 is a measure of the relative rms chandra / hst alignment for those images for which the best coordinates are available from method 2 .",
    "similarly , @xmath49 is a measure of the relative rms chandra / hst alignment for those images for which the the best coordinates are available from method 3 . in the following we use @xmath48 and @xmath49 to set the size of the error circles in our search for ulx counterparts . for method 1",
    "the relative rms chandra / hst alignment is more difficult to assess , because it is dominated by the accuracy and stability of the geometric distortion solutions for the two instruments . for wfpc2",
    "the relative positions of the chips have shifted by @xmath50 since launch ( anderson & king 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , this alignment depends on the accuracy to which a centroid of a source can be determined in both the x - ray and the optical data .",
    "the complexity of the morphology can affect this determination . in the following we conservatively , and somewhat arbitrarily , assume a rms chandra / hst alignment accuracy of @xmath39 for method 1 .",
    "we note that our results are more - or - less consistent with expectation .",
    "for example , if the absolute rms accuracy of usno - b1.0 registered coordinates is @xmath40 , the absolute rms accuracy of chandra pipeline coordinates is @xmath51 , and the absolute accuracy of wfpc2 pipeline coordinates is @xmath52 , then we would have expected that @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is in statistically acceptable agreement with our sample statistics .",
    "absolute accuracies of @xmath40 for usno - b1.0 registered coordinates and @xmath51 for chandra pipeline coordinates are slightly larger than the nominally expected values",
    ". however , it is not unreasonable to expect that a variety of small systematic errors could increase the achieved accuracies so as to exceed the nominal values .",
    "figure 1 shows large scale views of each of the galaxies and ulxs in our sample .",
    "these images are intended to illustrate the overall morphologies of the sample galaxies and the relative locations of the ulxs with respect to the galaxy nucleus .",
    "we therefore show only data for a single filter per galaxy .",
    "when images in multiple filters were available we preferentially chose to show a broad- or medium - band filter in the red or visual part of the spectrum , such as f814w , f791w , f606w , f555w , or f547 m ( see biretta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a discussion of the properties of wfpc2 filters ) . however , there are some exceptions to this . for ngc 1097 ,",
    "ngc 5033 , and ngc 7174 there is only data in the ultra - violet ( f218w , f300w ) part of the spectrum . for the antennae , one of its ulxs ( # 25 )",
    "is included only in a u - band ( f336w ) image . for ngc 4594",
    "only a narrow - band filter image is available ( f658n ) . for circinus , one of its ulxs ( # 41 )",
    "is included only in a narrow - band image ( f656n ) .",
    "the greyscale panels in figure 2 show @xmath56 arcsecond regions centered around the individual ulxs in the sample .",
    "a circle around each ulx indicates the 1@xmath57 accuracy of the astrometric registration , i.e. , @xmath58 for images aligned by method  1 , @xmath59 for images aligned by method  2 , or @xmath60 for images aligned by method  3 .",
    "these images show the general galaxy morphology around each ulx .",
    "they form the basis for the search for optical counterparts described in section  [ s : photometry ] .",
    "figure 2 shows each ulx , but not each dataset for each ulx . for conciseness",
    "we generally only show the highest quality image for each ulx . in most cases",
    "the morphology is visually very similar in the different filters for which data are available .",
    "however , in some cases the images in different filters do show different morphologies , and for these ulxs we show images of the same region in multiple filters in figure 2 .",
    "the cadc waspp pipeline performs a full reduction and image combination for the datasets in each association .",
    "we therefore did not attempt any additional reduction or calibration of the images .",
    "however , we did discover occasional peculiarities in the combined images from the cadc waspp pipeline .",
    "in particular , some of the images show evidence of improperly removed cosmic rays . most of these are cases in which only two exposures are available , and for which the data may simply having been inadequate to fully remove all cosmic rays and their coincidences .",
    "examples of galaxies for which some datasets appear to have residual cosmic rays are those of , ngc 4594 , ngc 5018 , and ngc 5033 .",
    "all counterparts were visually inspected to screen questionable cases .",
    "another peculiarity in some of the images is a sprinkling of negative pixels that seems inconsistent with the regular tail of the noise distribution .",
    "we learned ( cadc , priv .",
    "comm . ) that these are generally the result of combining two or more images with significantly different exposure times .",
    "we made sure that these pixels generally do not affect our photometry of potential counterparts ( unless in a few rare cases , which we explicitly identify as such below ) .",
    "figure 2 also shows some peculiarities that are intrinsic to the data and the wfpc2 instrument .",
    "most notably , the diagonal bright stripes visible in the images for ulxs 3 , 4 , and 31 are chip boundaries in the mosaiced data .",
    "we searched all the images for potential ulx optical counterparts . in doing",
    "so we restricted our attention to a search radius in the optical images that is twice the astrometric registration error for each ulx .",
    "all the ulxs in our sample reside in nearby galaxies , and many of these galaxies are spiral galaxies . such galaxies can have complicated morphologies , and we therefore commonly found diffuse structures of various kinds ( e.g. , parts of spiral arms , dust bands , etc . ) within the search radius around a ulx .",
    "such structures may be interesting if a connection to the ulx phenomenon could be demonstrated .",
    "however , we decided not to catalog such structures in the present context .",
    "instead , we decided to restrict our attention to sources within the search radius that appear point - like , i.e. , sources that are either consistent with the hst point spread function ( psf ) or which are only slightly more extended .",
    "such sources tend to be associated with star clusters , diffuse regions , or individual stars .",
    "all of these can provide essential insight into the ulx phenomenon if a direct association with a particular ulx could be demonstrated .",
    "our method for the identification of point - like sources depended on the galaxy morphology around the ulx . based on visual inspection we discriminated between several different classes of morphologies within the search radius .",
    "we classify as simple morphologies those cases in which there are one or more easily identifiable , point - like sources on a relatively smooth or constant background . for these morphologies",
    "we used the standard source detection routine daofind in the iraf software package to find point - like sources .",
    "we utilized 4@xmath57 as the detection threshold .",
    "we will refer to datasets in this category as case s ( s for `` simple '' ) .",
    "other ulxs are found in regions of more complicated morphology . these show diffuse , extended or dusty structures . in these cases we found that automated routines for source detection did not provide reliable results . nonetheless , in some fraction of cases with these complicated morphologies it was possible to manually identify point - like sources .",
    "we will refer to these as case m ( m for `` manual '' ) .",
    "we emphasize the point that the source detection in these cases is nevertheless somewhat arbitrary , particularly with regard to whether faint sources are considered to be real or artifacts .",
    "for the remainder of the complicated morphologies it was not possible to place any reliable limits on the presence or absence of point - like sources .",
    "we do not report any results for these cases , which we will refer to as case c ( c for `` complex '' ) .",
    "this primarily occurred in the cases of two galaxies , ngc 1068 and ngc 3034 ( m82 ) . in the case of ngc 1068 , while it appears that in some fields manual source detection would be possible , taken as a whole the combination of large numbers of sources within the 2@xmath57 error circle ( 3.3  in radius ) and complex spatial morphology would complicate the interpretation .",
    "we therefore defer detailed analysis in this case for future work when better astrometry may be available ( e.g. , by tying the astrometry of wfpc2 images to ground - based images ) .",
    "we also classified a source as `` c '' due to it being on the edge of the chip ( a possible counterpart to ulx 24 in the u3040205b observation ) .",
    "another category is formed by those ulxs for which the optical morphology within the search radius is smooth and straightforward , but in which there is no sign of detectable point - like sources .",
    "we will refer to these as case n ( n for `` nothing '' ) . a final category is formed by those ulxs for which the optical data was unreliable due to a high fraction of unrealistically negative pixels within the search radius .",
    "this problem of the data calibration was discussed in section  [ s : images ] .",
    "it only affected a few datasets so significantly that we felt that a quantitative analysis would not be warranted .",
    "these datasets are referred to as case x ( x for `` excluded '' ) . for each ulx and dataset",
    "we indicate in column  ( 5 ) of table  3 to what case it belongs . of the 145 unique dataset , ulx , and photometric case combinations , 20 ( 14% ) represent case s , 35 ( 24% ) represent case m , 37 ( 26% ) represent case c , 44 ( 30% ) represent case n and 9 ( 6% ) represent case x.    for 9 ulxs we have one or more datasets of case s , and for 20 ulxs we have one or more datasets of case m. these are the cases for which one or more point - like sources were either automatically or visually identified within the search region around the ulx . in total , we found potential counterparts for 28 of the 44 ulxs in our sample ( there is overlap between s and m cases for ulx 40 ) .",
    "we assigned each of the sources thus identified a unique i d number .",
    "the sources are labeled and shown schematically in separate panels of figure 2 .",
    "information on the sources is provided in table  3 .",
    "columns  ( 7 ) and  ( 8) give the offset of each source w.r.t .",
    "ulx position ( in ra and dec . ) .",
    "column  ( 9 ) gives the corresponding total offset . for each source we performed aperture photometry using the routine phot in the iraf software package .",
    "the photometry on the source was performed with an aperture of radius 0.1  ( this is 1 pixel on the wide field camera ccds and approximately 2 pixels on the planetary camera ccd ) .",
    "an appropriate background value was subtracted from the results . for case",
    "s , the local background was automatically measured in an annulus surrounding the point source . for case m ,",
    "the background was kept fixed at the value determined manually from a representative ( but carefully chosen ) region near the ulx .",
    "the measured count rates in apertures were converted to magnitudes using the zeropoints for each filter given in the wfpc2 data handbook ( mobasher et al .",
    "the resulting magnitudes are in the so - called vegamag system .",
    "this is a synthetic system in which the magnitude of the star vega is defined to be exactly zero in all filters . in the traditional johnson - cousins system",
    "the magnitude of vega is approximately zero in the ubvri bands , but not exactly ( bessel , castelli , & plez 1998 ) . in general , magnitudes on the vegamag system",
    "are close to those on the johnson - cousins system , provided the filters have similar central wavelengths .",
    "however , to actually transform the magnitudes onto the johnson - cousins system it is necessary to know the spectral shape , or at least a color , of each of the identified sources . since this is not generally known , or known well , we have not attempted such transformations .",
    "various corrections are necessary to the inferred magnitudes .",
    "first , an aperture correction is necessary to estimate the true magnitudes from those that are measured in a small aperture .",
    "we used the tinytim software ( krist & hook 2001 ) to generate synthetic psfs for each of the filters . from aperture photometry on these psfs we calculated the aperture corrections between the apertures that we used for the data analysis and a @xmath61 radius aperture .",
    "these corrections were applied to the inferred magnitudes .",
    "an additional correction of @xmath62 mag was applied to transform the results to a nominal infinite aperture ( mobasher et al .",
    "a second correction that must be applied is for geometric distortion , which results in a change of the surface area covered by each pixel .",
    "this pixel area variation is imprinted on point source counts during the flat - fielding step ( which is defined to make a source of uniform surface brightness look `` flat '' on the detector ) .",
    "we corrected for this using the known pixel area variations ( mobasher et al .",
    "the correction amounts to at most @xmath63 mag in the corners of each chip .",
    "the third correction that must be applied is for imperfect charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) , which causes charge to be lost from the aperture during read - out .",
    "we corrected all photometric results ( detections only ) using the cte correction algorithm of dolphin ( 2000 ) , using the equations posted at http://purcell.as.arizona.edu/wfpc2_calib/ ( december 2004 version ) .",
    "the cte corrections increase with decreasing background .",
    "the final magnitudes obtained after application of all corrections are listed in column  ( 10 ) of table  3 .",
    "we calculated the total statistical error as @xmath64^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath65 is the net number of counts in the aperture , a is the area of the aperture in pixels , @xmath57 is the noise level per pixel determined from the background region , and g is the gain ( either 7 or 14 electron / data unit ) .",
    "this error is more conservative than the error computed by the phot routine and was on average @xmath66/@xmath67 magnitudes larger for sources brighter / fainter than 24 .",
    "it is likely that these are underestimates of the true errors , especially in cases with complicated morphologies",
    ". implied absolute magnitudes were calculated based on the galaxy distances quoted in table  [ t : sample ] and are listed in column  ( 12 ) .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath68 ) estimates were calculated for each counterpart in each image and are listed in column  ( 13 ) , using the formula @xmath69 .",
    "sources for case  s mostly had @xmath70 , due to the detection threshold used in the daofind routine .",
    "for case  m sources we found that our manual source identification was also able to detect sources down to @xmath71 , although most of the sources thus identified have much higher @xmath68 .",
    "for each ulx and each dataset ( except those of case  x for which the data were suspect and case  c where the local background level is ambiguous ) we estimated the limiting magnitude down to which a source might plausibly have been detected .",
    "for this we calculate the noise in a background aperture of the same size as was used for source photometry .",
    "we multiply the result by 4 to get the counts needed for a @xmath72 detection .",
    "we transform this result to magnitudes using the exposure time and filter zeropoints and apply the appropriate aperture correction .",
    "the results are listed in column  ( 6 ) of table  3 . for comparison",
    ", we also calculated the limiting magnitudes using the exposure time calculators ( etcs ) for wfpc2 maintained by stsci .",
    "these more idealized calculations generally give somewhat fainter limits than the ones we calculated .",
    "this is as expected , given that the etcs do not take into account that we are searching for sources in nearby galaxies .",
    "the galaxy light adds both noise , fluctuations and complexity . in the final column we list source radius estimates .",
    "we found that kernel - fitting routines such as imexamine did not converge consistently , particularly for `` m '' sources .",
    "we therefore estimated the source sizes visually from the mosaic images ( with a uniform pixel size of 0.1  ) . while subjective , the intent here is to simply give an estimate for the spatial extent of the sources and not a detailed spatial analysis .",
    "we plot in figure [ f : size_hist ] a histogram of the estimated source sizes .",
    "the majority of sizes were in the range 0.1 - 0.4  , with a few outliers having larger sizes . excluding these outliers , the mean and standard deviation of the source radii are 0.22  and 0.05  , respectively .",
    "for comparison , from the wfpc2 instrument handbook , this mean radius corresponds to an encircled energy fraction of @xmath73 at 4000 . in cases where the use of imexamine resulted in a reasonable full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) estimate , the mean value was 0.15  whereas the mean visual source size for these sources was 0.19  .",
    "therefore most sources are likely to be point sources or at most only marginally resolved , with our visual size estimate being @xmath74 larger than the fwhm .",
    "we also list the linear extent corresponding to the source size assuming the distances listed in table 1 .",
    "we have presented a systematic analysis of archival wfpc2 observations for a sample of ulxs . the main motivation was to determine the characteristics of possible optical counterparts to ulxs .",
    "minimally a key goal was to determine what is the probability of detecting a counterpart .",
    "other goals would be to establish the typical optical luminosity of counterparts and how the implied x - ray to optical ( or uv ) luminosity ratio compares to known source types .",
    "finally , in cases in which observations are available in multiple wide - band filters , the optical colors might also be a useful discriminator of source type .",
    "below we address the color information content of the sample prior to computing optical luminosities since any knowledge of the spectral types of the counterparts would benefit the computation .",
    "of course , when multiple counterparts are present , obviously at most only one of the counterparts within the error circle can be the true counterpart of the ulx .",
    "also , when only a single , faint counterpart is observed , particularly in late - type galaxies , the association may simply be due to chance coincidence .",
    "therefore this discussion should be taken as an assessment of what properties any potential counterparts would have _ on average_.      as is evident from table 3 and figure [ f : stamps ] , variably zero , one or many counterparts are detected within the ( combined x - ray / hst ) error circles . since the stellar populations in elliptical galaxies are old ( and hence faint ) , a simple assumption would then be that finding no counterpart would be more common in early - type galaxies .",
    "also , since there is an association between x - ray binaries and globular clusters in elliptical galaxies ( see , e.g. , maccarone , kundu , & zepf 2003 ) , we might expect to find counterparts to extra - nuclear x - ray sources in elliptical galaxies that are likely to be globular clusters .",
    "to test these assumptions , we plot in figure [ f : htypes ] histograms showing the hubble type distribution for the chandra / wfpc2 galaxy sample ( with 25 galaxies total ) , the subset in which at most one counterpart was detected ( 15 galaxies ) and the subset in which more than one counterpart was detected and/or an observation was marked as complex ( 10 galaxies ) . as expected , there is a tendency for single or no counterparts to be found in early - type galaxies and multiple counterparts and/or complex cases to occur in late - type galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ f : htypes ] we also compare the hubble types of the galaxies in our chandra / wfpc2 sample to the type distribution of nearby ( @xmath75 , or d @xmath0 66 mpc for @xmath76 = 75 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 and @xmath77 = 0.5 ) galaxies in rc3 , in order to assess if there is any bias in our galaxy sample . while the statistics are limited , there is a slight excess of ellipticals and irregular / peculiars , and a more pronounced excess of sb / c galaxies in our sample relative to nearby galaxies .",
    "note that the prominent peak in the chandra / wfpc2 galaxy type distribution at sb / c is mainly due to a large number of sb ( type = 3 ) galaxies ( see table [ t : sample ] ) .",
    "therefore , in addition to the excess of sb galaxies , the main bias in the sample is a lack of early - type ( i.e. , s0 , sa ) and late type ( i.e , sd ) spiral galaxies .    finally , we computed the number of background sources expected for the galaxies with hubble type @xmath03 and hubble type @xmath78 3 .",
    "this was done by taking the larger of the limiting flux in each chandra field and the flux associated with a @xmath79 source ( i.e. , see ptak & colbert 2004 ) , in both cases computed in the 2 - 10 kev band based on the full - band count rates .",
    "the number of background sources expected in each field was then taken from the 2 - 10 kev logn - logs plot given in bauer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) derived from the chandra deep fields .",
    "this resulted in an estimate of 5.5 background sources in the early - type galaxies ( 35% of the total ) and 3.8 background sources in the late - type galaxies ( 14% of the total ) .",
    "we turn now to cases in which there are observations of a ulx in more than one wide - band filter and at least one detection ( and hence a color or color limit can be computed ) . here",
    "we restrict our sample to observations with the filters f336w",
    ", f450w , f555w , f606w and f814w since they map reasonably well to standard ubvi magnitudes . with both f555w and f606w approximating the v band ,",
    "hereafter we refer to them as @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "only a few ulxs did not have a ( cadc ) observation in one of these filters , and in those cases the observations were entirely in either narrow - band ( e.g. , ulx 41 in circinus ) or uv ( e.g. , ulxs 43 and 44 ) filters .",
    "the colors and color limits are listed in table [ t : colors ] .",
    "the colors b - v and v - i are plotted ( as a function of hubble type of the host galaxy ) in figure [ f : colors ] . note that 6/9 of the @xmath81-i and 5/8 of the b-@xmath81 data points are due to ulx 1 in ngc 278 ( hubble type 3 = sb ) . the color f555w - f814w differs from johnson v - i negligibly for v - i in the range -1 to 3 ( see holzman et al .",
    "the sense of the correction between @xmath81 and @xmath80 is such that it is negligible for sources with v - i @xmath0 0.5 . for red sources , @xmath82 ( for stellar types g and m0iii ) , i.e.",
    ", at worst we are underestimating v - i where v=@xmath81 .",
    "excluding the counterparts marked as complex , there are 67 unique counterparts in which one of ubvi was used . for observations in these filters",
    "we first compute the absolute magnitude and the luminosity in solar units , e.g. , @xmath83 ) , where we use @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 for solar absolute magnitudes ( zombeck 1990 ) .",
    "the results are listed in table [ t : lopt ] . since @xmath88 of",
    "the counterparts include either a @xmath80 or @xmath81 measurements , and v is a convenient magnitude for comparison with published photometry and models , we proceed by computing an effective v - band luminosity . for cases with color information available , we classified the counterpart as red if v - i @xmath89 0.5 , b - v @xmath89 0.5 , b - i @xmath89 1.0 , or u - v @xmath89 0.7 and blue otherwise .",
    "if no color information is available , then we assumed sources in galaxies with hubble type @xmath90 to be red and blue otherwise . for red ( blue ) counterparts , we computed @xmath91 assuming a g5 ( a0 ) stellar spectrum .",
    "we then computed @xmath92 , the effective absolute v magnitude , and @xmath93 ( we assumed an effective wavelength of 5500   and zero - point flux density of @xmath94 ; zombeck 1990 ) , also listed in table [ t : lopt ] .",
    "@xmath95 is listed in units of @xmath96 , and these values are in good agreement with those computed from the absolute magnitudes in individual filters .    in figure [",
    "f : veffs ] we show the distributions of @xmath91 and @xmath97 .",
    "while the statistics are limited , the @xmath91 distribution is reminiscent of a power - law distribution with a cut - off at @xmath98 , which is consistent with the average limiting magnitude of the fields discussed here ( 24.9 ) .",
    "the @xmath99 distribution shows that we are observing sources at least as luminous @xmath100 , with a mean value of @xmath101 .",
    "we also plot the luminosity distributions only including sources brighter that v=24 and v=23.5 . the large drop - offs in number",
    "counts below @xmath102 suggests that we are only approaching completeness for counterparts with @xmath103 .",
    "we also plot the effective v band luminosity distribution for upper - limits ( also listed in table [ t : lopt ] ) .",
    "for the majority of cases the limiting luminosity was @xmath104 or higher , suggesting that the lack of a counterpart was due at least in part to the lack of sufficient depth in those fields to detect counterparts of comparable luminosity to the counterparts in the entire sample .",
    "an important issue is to what extent there is a trend in counterpart luminosity with distance since at larger distances only brighter sources would be detectable ( i.e. , the malmquist bias ) , and source confusion may also become problematic at larger distances . in figure [",
    "f : veff_dist ] we plot the the optical luminosities of the counterparts as a function of distance , and there is in fact a strong correlation between @xmath97 and distance , although only at distances @xmath105 mpc .",
    "we also plot the luminosity expected for a source at a constant flux level ( with arbitrary normalization ) to show the sense of the malmquist bias .",
    "the observed optical luminosities increase more rapidly than this trend , although of course in practice the observations were performed with a range of filters and exposure times resulting in a large range in limiting flux .",
    "source confusion may also be contributing , however the lack of a strong trend at larger distances suggests the neither source confusion nor malmquist bias is a factor at distances @xmath106 mpc . since our discussion is largely based on optical luminosities spanning @xmath107 dex , the presence of some source confusion is not going to strongly impact our conclusions .      unless an ulx is in reality an interloper ( i.e. , a foreground star or background agn ) ,",
    "the most likely physical model is that they are some sort of x - ray binary ( xrb ; e.g. , see colbert et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this case",
    ", the most optimistic scenario is that a given optical counterpart is the companion star .",
    "however , the ulx counterpart may also represent a cluster of stars or simply a clump of gas or stars ( particularly in an arm of a spiral galaxy ) .",
    "we address these in turn below .",
    "the absolute magnitudes in table [ t : lopt ] are in the range -5 to -12 , corresponding to @xmath108 .",
    "blue giant stars have @xmath109 and supergiants can have @xmath110 .",
    "in the supergiant case the colors are not restrictive since blue , yellow or red supergiants could be present .",
    "however in all of these cases the stars would be very young ( @xmath111 years ; bertelli et al .",

    "larger amounts of dilution would be consistent with the observed @xmath138 values since the typical lmxb @xmath138 values are 2 dex or more larger than observed in our counterparts . in summary , our observed @xmath95 and x - ray",
    "/ optical flux ratios are generally consistent with a lmxb in old clusters , but probably only consistent with a hmxb in young clusters if the optical light of the x - ray binary is a larger fraction of the optical light of the entire cluster than is the case with a lmxb in an old cluster .",
    "finally , we estimate the black hole mass that would be expected if a black hole were present with @xmath139 of the cluster mass .",

    "note that we plotted black hole mass estimates based on a mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio of 1 , i.e. , @xmath146 , which is only appropriate for a cluster of age several billion years . from population synthesis modeling the m / l ratio of a cluster",
    "is expected to range from @xmath147 to @xmath148 for clusters of age @xmath149 to @xmath150 years @xcite .",
    "therefore for young clusters the black hole masses would be @xmath151 dex lower than plotted here .",

    "most of the x - ray luminosities are well below the predicted eddington luminosity given the estimated @xmath95 , although there are some cases where the x - ray luminosity exceeds this value , suggesting either anisotropic emission or a larger black hole mass than @xmath139 of the cluster mass ( again the @xmath153 ratio may differ significantly from 1 as assumed here ) .",
    "also note that , particularly in the case of spiral galaxies , multiple counterparts are found for some ulxs , and the corresponding bh masses for each counterpart are plotted in figure [ f : bhmass ] .",
    "of course it is unlikely that all counterparts in those cases are bound systems with an intermediate - mass black hole .",

    "the limiting luminosities are often above the faintest observed luminosities suggesting that the lack of multiple counterparts in some cases is due to insufficient depth .",
    "we focused on the `` wide '' filter observations corresponding to ubvi filters since the colors could be compared to known source properties .",
    "this analysis showed that there was a slight tendency for early - type galaxies to have counterparts that were red ( i.e. , b - v @xmath89 0.5 , v - i @xmath89 0.5 ) and conversely late - type galaxies had blue counterparts . in general the source properties did not differ significantly from the properties of those expected from either structure in spiral disks ( although in a few cases the colors were blue suggesting a young region ) or clusters .",
    "the counterparts found in early - type galaxies are generally consistent with globular clusters in both their colors and luminosities .",
    "the x - ray / optical flux ratios were generally consistent with high - mass x - ray binaries , background agn or low - mass x - ray binaries in clusters ( i.e. , with artificially lowered flux ratios ) . therefore for most of the sources ,",

    "<S> we present a systematic analysis of archival hst wfpc2 `` association '' data sets that correlate with the chandra positions of a set of 44 ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) of nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the main motivation is to address the nature of ulxs by searching for optical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> sixteen of the ulxs are found in early - type galaxies ( rc3 hubble type @xmath0 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have improved the chandra - hst relative astrometry whenever possible , resulting in errors circles of 0.3 - 1.7  in size . disparate numbers of potential ulx counterparts are found , and in some cases none are found . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of or low number of counterparts in some cases may be due to insufficient depth in the wfpc2 images . particularly in late - type galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> the hst image in the ulx region was often complex or crowded , requiring source detection to be performed manually . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore address various scenarios for the nature of the ulx since it is not known which , if any , of the sources found are true counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> the optical luminosities of the sources are typically in the range @xmath1 , with ( effective ) v magnitudes typically in the range 22 - 24 . in several cases color information is available , with the colors roughly tending to be more red in early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , in general , the ( potential ) counterparts found in early - type galaxies are likely to be older stellar populations , and are probably globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> several early - type galaxy counterparts have blue colors , which may be due to younger stellar populations in the host galaxies , however these could also be background sources . in spiral galaxies the sources may also be due to localized structure in the disks rather than bound stellar systems . alternatively some of the counterparts in late - type galaxies may be isolated supergiant stars . </S>",
    "<S> the observed x - ray / optical flux ratio is diluted by the optical emission of the cluster in cases where the system is an x - ray binary in a cluster , particularly in the case of a low - mass x - ray binaries in old cluster . if any of the counterparts are bound systems with @xmath2 stars _ and _ are the true counterparts to the ulx sources , then the x - ray luminosities of the ulx are generally well below the eddington limit for a black hole with mass @xmath3 of the cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the optical flux of the counterparts is consistent with being dominated by emission from an accretion disk around an intermediate - mass black hole if the black hole happens to have a mass @xmath4 and is accreting at close to the eddington rate , unless the accretion disk is irradiated ( which would result in high optical disk luminosities at lower black hole masses ) . </S>"
