    "in the past few years there has been a considerable progress in the understanding of the physics of fluids in restricted geometries @xcite .",
    "the properties of liquids or gases confined in narrow pores appear different from those in the bulk . a common trend of these systems is the fact that condensation occurs at pressures different from the saturation bulk pressure and the critical temperature for phase separation is generally lower than the corresponding bulk temperature . according to nakanishi and fisher @xcite an incompressible fluid mixture ( with isotropic interactions ) under the effect of confinement displays a reduced tendency toward phase separation at a fixed temperature , because the effective attractive forces result weaker within a pore .",
    "the confinement also determines an effective dimensional reduction thus enhancing fluctuation effects .",
    "in addition , the presence of adsorbing walls may induce a surface transition in a sub - critical fluid , even when this is in a single phase region in the bulk .",
    "such a behavior , which is now well understood by means of a mean field approach @xcite is due essentially to the reduction of the contribution to the free energy from the the cohesive fluid - fluid forces caused by the presence of the confining walls .",
    "there exists , however , a class of non - simple fluid mixtures for which the situation is different : these are the strongly associating mixtures .",
    "strong directional attractive interactions such as hydrogen bonding or charge transfer complexing between molecules affect dramatically the properties of the fluid or solid .",
    "an interesting phenomenon that occurs in such a mixture is the reentrant miscibility : the mixture is completely miscible at low temperatures , up to a temperature where it separates into two liquid phases . as the temperature",
    "is further increased the complete miscibility reappears .",
    "the nicotine - water mixture is a paradigm for such a behavior @xcite .",
    "the temperature - composition phase diagram shows closed - loops of immiscibility , characterized by the existence of a lower and an upper critical solution point ( lcsp and ucsp , respectively ) .",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed a mechanism to explain the reentrant miscibility .",
    "the essential ingredient is the existence of highly directional strong attraction ( as the hydrogen - bond ) between the unlike particles .",
    "the dispersive ( isotropic ) forces between these particles are assumed to be so weak as to favor segregation of the species . at low temperatures ,",
    "the energy favors complete mixing .",
    "however , as the temperature increases , the energy decrement due to the formation of directional bonds competes with the decrease of orientational entropy . as a consequence ,",
    "the system phase separates when the temperature raises .",
    "this mechanism has been confirmed by theoretical studies on lattice @xcite and continuous models @xcite , as well as in recent computer simulation studies @xcite .",
    "how the presence of substrates or the confinement in a pore affect the behavior of these mixtures ( if in a manner similar to that of simple fluids , or if on the contrary these mixtures are peculiar ) is an issue of great practical and theoretical interest .",
    "the presence of selectively adsorbing substrates can interfere with the formation of bulk hydrogen - bonding , leading to a stabilization of the two - phase region with respect to the completely miscible phase .",
    "computer simulation studies on confined lattice models @xcite show the appearance of surface transitions in a range of temperatures below the lcsp .",
    "the same mechanism has been invoked to explain some experiments @xcite that seemed to contradict the nakanishi - fisher picture .    in the present paper",
    "we shall study a lattice model of associating binary mixtures , introduced few years ago by lin and taylor @xcite and reconsidered recently by the present authors @xcite . in spite of its idealized nature , the model has the merit of allowing for an explicit analysis of its non trivial phase diagram .",
    "as an instance , the study of its bulk properties predicts the existence of closed - loops of immiscibility under constant pressure conditions . this analysis will be extended to the behavior of the mixture in presence of substrates and under confinement .",
    "the structure of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly present the model and write explicitly the equations for the order parameter profiles .",
    "section iii is devoted to analyze in detail the wetting behavior of the mixture in the presence of adsorbing substrates . in section",
    "iv we study the capillary behavior of the same system when confined between two parallel plates ( a slit ) and in section v we consider the same system confined in a network of very narrow cylinders .",
    "capillary transitions ( and surface transitions for the slab geometry ) will be analyzed in terms of the physical parameters of the system . finally , in section vi we present our conclusions .",
    "some years ago , lin and taylor proposed a lattice model to describe a binary mixture in which the two unlike species can form highly directional bonds . in more detail ,",
    "the lin - taylor ( lt ) model @xcite is an a - b binary mixture lattice model , defined on a generic d - dimensional lattice of coordination number @xmath0 .",
    "the a particles are allowed to singly occupy any of the lattice cells .",
    "every cell contains @xmath0 equal sub - cells , one for each face of the mother cell .",
    "again , each sub - cell can host at most one b particle , provided the mother cell is not occupied by an a particle .",
    "in addition to the repulsive interactions ( which determine the previous occupation rules ) , one includes short - ranged interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the interaction strength between a pair of nearest - neighbor a particles is @xmath1 , @xmath2 between unlike species and @xmath3 between b - b particles .",
    "all these interactions are non - vanishing only if the particles share a face .",
    "the bulk properties , as well as the global phase diagram , have been exhaustively analyzed in previous work @xcite .",
    "one of the main conclusions of such studies is that the appearance of closed loops of immiscibility occurs when the interaction between a - a and a - b pairs are attractive ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 .",
    "the latter condition is in complete agreement with the mechanism proposed by hirschfelder _",
    "@xcite for the reentrant miscibility . in this work",
    ", we assume the bulk fluid - fluid parameters to have values : @xmath7 ( it defines the energy scale ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , so that we are in the regime where closed - loops of immiscibility appear .",
    "the presence of substrates introduces new interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we shall assume that the substrates do not affect the fluid - fluid interactions , i.e. there is no surface enhancement .",
    "the interaction strength between an a particle and the substrate is @xmath10 , if the particle is in a cell in contact with the substrate , and zero otherwise .",
    "the interaction between the b particles and the substrate is orientationally dependent , i.e. its strength @xmath11 is non vanishing only if the face of the b particle touches the substrate .",
    "the form of the substrate - fluid interactions are consistent with the bulk interactions .",
    "hereafter , the substrate - fluid interactions will be assumed as attractive , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for absolute values of @xmath11 large enough ,",
    "the substrate - b interactions compete with the bulk a - b interactions , so that one expect this type of substrate to enhance the demixing tendency for temperatures lower than the corresponding lcsp .    , width=325 ]    to study the lt model in presence of substrates , we consider the grand - canonical ensemble , where the system is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir at fixed temperature @xmath14 and chemical potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the activities @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined via @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . after tracing over all configurations of the b particles , the system results to be isomorphic to a mono - component lattice gas , with renormalized interactions and chemical potential .",
    "the details on this procedure can be found in refs .",

    "obviously , @xmath28 . finally , @xmath29 is the canonical partition function of the ising model on the same lattice .",
    "let us name @xmath30 the effective coupling constant , @xmath31 the effective bulk magnetic field , and @xmath32 , the effective surface magnetic field acting only on the boundary sites : @xmath33 \\label{h_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all equilibrium properties can be obtained from the knowledge of the partition function eq .",
    "( [ partition ] ) by using standard thermodynamical relationships .",
    "in particular , the bulk pressure is obtained as : @xmath34 \\label{pressure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the volume of lattice cell , and @xmath36 .",
    "the mole fraction @xmath37 profile is obtained as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , the a particle density in the cell @xmath40 , is defined in terms of the local magnetization @xmath41 as : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the b particle density in the sub - cell @xmath44 of the cell @xmath40 is @xmath45 if the sub - cell is by the substrate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath43 is defined as : @xmath46 \\label{nbprof2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the 2-spin correlation function between the magnetization on the cell @xmath40 and its nearest - neighbor @xmath48 that it is associated to the sub - cell @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to see that in the homogeneous case these equations reduce to the expressions given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the lt model and the ising model , allows one to obtain the surface behavior of the mixture from the knowledge of the behavior of the latter .",
    "however , such a mapping , is not at all trivial and may lead in some cases to unexpected results .",
    "let us consider an a - b binary mixture in the presence of a planar , infinite and structureless substrate .",
    "such a substrate confines the fluid to the half - space @xmath49 .",
    "when the fluid ( e.g. , the a - particle rich phase , @xmath50 ) is at bulk coexistence , the substrate can promote the formation of drops of the opposite coexisting phase ( the b - particle rich phase @xmath51 ) on it , characterized by a contact angle @xmath52 . when @xmath53 , the drops spread over the substrate , i.e. the phase @xmath51 wets completely the @xmath50-substrate interface .",
    "a finite value of @xmath52 , instead , corresponds to a partial wetting situation .",
    "the crossover between a partial to a complete wetting regime is called the wetting transition @xcite .",
    "the surface tensions involved in the problem ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , corresponding to the @xmath50-substrate , @xmath51-substrate and @xmath50-@xmath51 interfaces , respectively ) are related to the contact angle via the young equation @xcite : @xmath57 thermodynamically the surface tensions correspond to the excess grand - canonical free energy per interfacial unit area ( respect to the bulk ) @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath56 and @xmath55 have an analytical behavior at this thermodynamic state , the wetting transition is a ( surface ) thermodynamic phase transition , as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ young ] ) and the dependence of @xmath52 on the temperature . as usual",
    ", appropiate order parameters corresponding to the wetting transition can be defined as first derivatives of the surface tension respect to thermodynamic fields . in simple fluids ,",
    "the excess number of particles per interfacial unit area or adsorption @xmath58 ( that corresponds to @xmath59 , being @xmath60 the chemical potential ) is the natural order parameter choice . in mixtures ,",
    "other choices are available , e.g. the volume integrated excess mole fraction per interfacial unit area .",
    "microscopically , the wetting transition manifests itself as the growth of a macroscopically thick @xmath51 layer intruding in the @xmath50-substrate interface composition profile .",
    "three different types of wetting transition may arise .",
    "if the layer width jumps suddenly from a microscopically finite value , the wetting transition is first order , and an off - coexistence surface transition ( prewetting ) is associated to it . if the layer width diverges continuously , the wetting transition is named critical .",
    "finally , the wetting transition can occur as the accumulation point of an infinite sequence of first - order transitions in the layering wetting case ( these transitions extend to the off - coexistence region ) .",
    "the conditions for such a transition depend subtly on the fluid - fluid and substrate - fluid interactions , and interfacial fluctuations can play an important role @xcite .    .",
    "thick solid lines correspond to critical lines , dashed lines to the a pure gas - liquid coexistence lines and thin solid lines to the wetting transition lines .",
    "the symbol @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) means the bulk conditions where there exist wetting of the @xmath51-substrate ( @xmath50-substrate ) interface by the @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) phase , respectively ( see text ) .",
    "the bulk conditions under which there is partial wetting are also shown.[fig2],width=325 ]    in the lt model two - phase coexistence occurs when @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the lattice dependent ising critical coupling",
    ". moreover , the wetting behavior is controlled by the ratio @xmath66 , that is the ratio between the surface energy and the loss of bulk energy due to the presence of the surface .",
    "if such a parameter is positive the substrate favors the @xmath50-phase to intrude between the substrate and the @xmath51-phase . on the other hand , if @xmath67 the phase @xmath51 intrudes between the substrate and the phase @xmath50 .",
    "we shall focus on the coexistence side @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) for @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , respectively ( otherwise , only partial wetting can occur ) .",
    "if the absolute value of the parameter is larger than one ( @xmath72 ) , then all coexistence surface corresponds to a complete wetting situation .",
    "if such a condition is not fulfilled , one will observe a partial wetting situation up to a value @xmath73 ( dependent on @xmath74 ) and beyond it a complete wetting situation up to @xmath75 .",
    "let us consider first the case @xmath76 , when @xmath32 depends only on @xmath14 , regardless the value of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the sign of @xmath32 is uniquely determined by the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath77 over the whole temperature range .",
    "one can envisage various cases ( see fig .",

    "if @xmath79 , there exists a region of complete wetting @xmath62 and a lower pressure region of partial wetting . as @xmath10 decreases , the region of complete wetting @xmath62 shrinks and eventually disappears for @xmath80 , because @xmath81 . for @xmath82 , the sign of @xmath32 changes and a region of complete wetting of the interface substrate - phase @xmath51 by phase @xmath50 appears ( @xmath61 ) . as @xmath10 increases , the region of partial wetting reduces and disappears for @xmath83 .    , @xmath9 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the thick solid line corresponds to the bulk critical line , and the thick dashed line to the liquid - vapor transition line of the a pure fluid .",

    "the behavior of the layering transitions at low temperatures shows surprising features .",

    "the physical interpretation of this phenomenon is that the surface adsorbs preferentially b particles .",

    "therefore , the tendency to phase separate in a fluid layer close to the substrate is enhanced ( because the a - b bonding favors mixing ) for temperatures lower than the ( lower ) critical temperature .",
    "this fact was also observed in computer simulations of a different model of associating binary mixture in ref .",
    "however , we must stress that this phenomenon is not related to an enhanced coupling ( i.e. the interactions between particles in the first layer close to the substrate are increased respect the bulk values ) , that it is known to stabilize surface transitions to temperatures higher to the bulk critical one in the ising model @xcite .",

    "the bulk transition ( thin solid line ) is also plotted for comparison .",
    "the inset corresponds to an enlargement of the zone around the bulk critical point .",
    "[ fig9],width=325 ]    we have obtained the constant temperature phase diagrams for @xmath161 ( see fig . [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "various transitions are observed for @xmath170 .",
    "one of these transitions converges toward the bulk phase transition for large separations and is identified with the true capillary transition .",
    "the remaining transitions are characterized by having similar average molar fractions and correspond to the layering transitions observed in the presence of a single substrate . the coverages ( as defined by eq .",
    "( [ adsorcion ] ) ) corresponding to the coexisting phases in these transitions converge very fast to the semi - infinite values , as expected from their surface nature .",
    "however , the number of these transitions depends strongly on @xmath149 , since the capillary transition , which depends sensibly on @xmath149 , competes with them @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath171 only the first layering transition appears , while the second appears for @xmath172 .",
    "the values of the capillary critical pressure for small @xmath149 are larger than the corresponding bulk critical values . by increasing @xmath149 , the capillary critical pressure decreases up to a minimum , corresponding to a pressure less than the bulk critical pressure . from such value",
    "it converges monotonically to the bulk critical value ( see figure [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "this fact means that along an isobaric the lcsp shifts to lower temperatures only for very narrow pores .",
    "consequently , the stabilizing mechanism of the coexistence region below the bulk lcsp seems to be only effective for small values of @xmath149 .",
    "the deviations of the capillary critical pressure with respect to the bulk value in the range @xmath173 follow a power law @xmath174 , with @xmath175 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the findings for the confined lattice gas for intermediate values of @xmath149 reported in ref .",
    "the scaling behavior @xmath176 ( @xmath177 in the mean - field approach ) predicted by the nakanishi - fisher theory should be obeyed for larger values of @xmath149 .",
    "however , our results do not extend to that region due to the numerical error in estimating the capillary critical pressure close to the bulk critical point .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect a change in the tendency for large values of @xmath149 and we expect our results to be qualitatively correct for all values of @xmath149 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the slab approximation @xcite , which corresponds to set @xmath159 for all @xmath48 , predicts that for sufficiently small @xmath178 the capillary critical pressure is larger than the bulk value for _ all _ the values of @xmath149 .",
    "the failure of this approach is not surprising since it gives poor results for the confined lattice gas close to the capillary critical point as it overestimates both @xmath30 and @xmath31 at the capillary critical point @xcite .",
    "this fact alters the balance between the different mechanisms involved in the shift of the critical point , leading to the wrong result mentioned above .     versus @xmath149 for @xmath161 ( same conditions as fig .",

    "this model can be understood as a crude approximation for adsorption in zeolites .",
    "it represents another instance in which the substrate can prevent the formation of hydrogen bonds : the geometrical hindrance due to the confinement in very narrow nanopores .",
    "we shall assume that the pore diameter is so small that the a - b bonds can form only along the direction @xmath179 parallel to the cylinder axis ( see figure [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "the cylinder diameter is taken to be less than twice the a - b collision diameter .",
    "in addition , the pores have diameters less than two a particle diameters and they form a two dimensional network with coordination number @xmath26 . we allow attenuated interactions between particles in nearest neighbor pores , in order to allow a capillary transition .",

    "[ fig11],width=325 ]    the in - pore fluid - fluid interactions have the same form as in bulk , with coupling constants @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . however , the interactions between particles in nearest - neighbor pores are attenuated to @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) , although the a - b and b - b interactions directional character remains the same as before .",

    "@xmath189 has the same expression as the bulk coupling constant eq .",

    "( [ defh ] ) .",
    "one can see that confinement shifts the effective magnetic field @xmath31 with respect to its bulk value with a contribution analogous to that found for planar substrates ( compare eqs .",
    "( [ h_1 ] ) and ( [ defh - zeolite ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , the confinement determines an anisotropy in the couplings .",
    "the a particle molar fraction @xmath192 reads : @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the a particle density , and @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) is the density of b particles oriented in a perpendicular ( parallel ) direction to the cylinder axis , respectively : @xmath197    phases characterized by different molar fractions @xmath192 may coexist when the spontaneous ( i.e. @xmath198 ) magnetization @xmath199 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath7 , @xmath200 and @xmath9 , that corresponds to a case that presents closed - loops of immiscibility in the bulk . on the other hand ,",
    "as the hydrogen bond interactions are very short - ranged , we will take @xmath201 as physically sensible values .",
    "moreover , @xmath181 is set to be @xmath202 , where @xmath50 is a positive number less than one .    in order to discriminate between different mechanisms , we chose the substrate - fluid interactions in such a way that @xmath203 , i.e. @xmath204 and @xmath76 . hence , the preferential substrate adsorption effect ( very similar to the one studied in the slab geometry ) is suppressed and we can focus on the coupling anisotropy .",
    "we have studied the 2d square lattice case , for which analytical expressions for @xmath205 are known in the anisotropic case @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the features obtained for this case will be qualitatively correct also for the 3d case . from the exact solution , the values of @xmath206 that correspond to the phase coexistence satisfy the following relationship : @xmath207 where equality holds only at the critical point .",
    "it is clear from such an expression that , even for @xmath189 ( equal to the bulk value ) less than the isotropic bulk value , the system can undergo a phase transition for @xmath190 large enough .",
    "note that since @xmath208 , this condition is fulfilled in the low temperature region .",
    "this fact is also observed in the mean - field approach , for which the coexistence condition is @xmath209 .    :",
    "@xmath210 ( dashed line ) , @xmath211 ( dotted - dashed line ) and @xmath212 ( dotted line ) . the bulk critical line ( solid line ) and the a pure vapor - liquid line ( long dashed line ) are also plotted . in the inset ,",
    "the phase diagrams corresponding to @xmath213 for the same values of @xmath50 ( the symbol meaning is the same as previously ) and their comparison with the bulk phase diagram ( solid line ) .",
    "[ fig12],width=325 ]    figure [ fig12 ] shows the reservoir conditions under which the capillary phase transition occurs for different values of @xmath50 .",
    "there also exist immiscibility islands for the capillary transition within the porous medium ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) , but the corresponding lcsp occurs at temperatures lower than those of the bulk lcsp at the same pressure . as @xmath50 , increases the temperature and pressure range for which one observes capillary transition increases .",
    "hence , the immiscibility islands become larger with @xmath50 , but mainly in the high temperature region .",
    "in fact , the temperature corresponding to the lcsp is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath50 , and it is always below the temperature corresponding to the bulk lcsp .",
    "our findings can be understood by a simple physical argument .",
    "the geometry forbids the formation of hydrogen bondings in the directions perpendicular to the cylinder axis .",
    "so , the confinement effectively reduces the a - b bonds respect to the bulk case , and consequently the phase separation is enhanced in the lower temperature regime , in complete agreement with our results .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect on the phase equilibria of an associating binary mixture in the presence of substrates and under confinement in very simple geometries .",
    "we have focused on the conditions in which bulk system exhibits closed - loops of immiscibility .",
    "our results show clearly that the presence of directional fluid - substrate interactions can stabilize purely surface transitions ( such as layering and prewetting ) and also for the phase separation under confinement in nanopores , for temperatures below the bulk lcsp .",
    "however , this mechanism becomes inefficient for the capillary transition when the surface - to - volume ratio is small , and consequently we doubt that it can explain the experimental results in refs .",
    "@xcite , which would correspond to the latter case .",
    "the disagreement with the scaling predictions in the cases in which the temperature shift depends on the substrate remains , in any case , unsolved .",
    "the experimental data show a capillary critical temperature dependence on the film width that it is not consistent with the scaling predictions @xcite and it could be a signature of an emerging new characteristic length scale .",
    "however , to our knowledgement there is no theoretical explanation of such a behavior .",
    "some final remarks are pertinent .",
    "firstly , the present model represents a simplified description of an associating binary mixture , but keeps all the physical ingredients needed to reproduce the correct phenomenology .",
    "consequently , we are confident that our conclusions can be relevant also for more sophisticated models .",
    "secondly , fluid adsorption in nanotubes and zeolites is experimentally feasible and they could provide experimental probes of our theoretical predictions .",
