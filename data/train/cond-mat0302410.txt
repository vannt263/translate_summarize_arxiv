    "they have been shown to possess many atomlike properties , such as the specific shell structure , determined by the properties of the external confinement .",
    "@xcite    in lithographically fabricated quantum dots the electrons are strictly confined on the interface of the semiconductor heterostructure , which makes the dot essentially two - dimensional . the lateral confinement , created by adding a voltage to the top gate electrodes , is most commonly approximated by the harmonic oscillator potential . in the isotropic case ,",
    "this modeling has been shown to lead to a similar addition energy spectrum as measured in the experiments , and adjustments in the model potential have made the agreement even more precise ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "deviations from parabolic confinement have most commonly been studied in connection with the far - infrared response ( fir ) .",
    "@xcite this is due to the generalized kohn s theorem , @xcite stating that fir couples only to the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion which in the case of a perfect parabolic potential can be separated from the relative motion ( rm ) .",
    "since the cm motion has the same energy eigenvalues and dipole resonance frequencies as a single electron , no information on internal degrees of freedom can be obtained .",

    "@xcite studied polygonal two - electron quantum dots with numerically exact diagonalization , concentrating on the wigner crystallization , @xcite i.e. , the localization of the electrons due to the dominant coulomb interaction in the low - density limit . in our previous work , @xcite we found an agreement with their results for polygonal dots by using the spin - density - functional theory ( sdft ) .",
    "we extended the examination to larger electron numbers , including broken spin - symmetry configurations .",

    "our main purpose is , however , to clarify the electronic behavior in a rectangular box , beginning from a basic textbook - example of quantum mechanics and leading to the discussion of the role of interactions and symmetry - broken solutions in different regimes .",

    "a detailed description of this method , generalized to an arbitrary number of lowest eigenenergy states , can be found in ref .  .",
    "the variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) @xcite method starts from constructing a trial many - body wave function @xmath39 with desired properties and with free variational parameters @xmath40 .",

    "the variational principle guarantees that the total energy given by the vmc method , using any trial wave function with proper particle symmetry , is always an upper bound for the true total energy of the quantum state in question .",
    "the variance of the local energy @xmath48 diminishes as the trial wave function approaches an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , and as a result it can be used not only as a measure of the statistical error in @xmath49 , but also as a measure of the difference between calculated and true energies @xmath50 .",
    "the variational parameters in the trial wave function are optimized by minimizing the total energy .",
    "the minimization process itself was done using the stochastic gradient method.@xcite the method has proven to be fast and reliable .",

    "we neglect the three - body and higher correlations .",
    "this has shown to be very accurate in our previous vmc studies ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",

    "we keep the dot area constant , @xmath57 , through our calculations .",
    "the density parameter , defined as @xmath58 ( ref .  ) , thus gets values between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the electron density in our quantum dots is therefore higher on the average than that of austing _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with @xmath61 .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the difference has no noticeable effect on our results . in fig .",
    "[ che ] we show        the sdft and vmc results for the chemical potentials , @xmath62 , ( @xmath63 set to zero ) , for various values of @xmath8 .",
    "the agreement between the results is good and independent of @xmath4 and @xmath8 . as a consequence of the two - fold degeneracy in the eigenstates , the pairing of chemical potential values dominates the picture .",
    "however , a closer look reveals deviations from this tendency . due to hund s rule , near the degenerate points in the single - electron spectrum ,",
    "the spins of the two highest energy electrons are parallel and they occupy different states .",
    "so , there are regimes in which @xmath64 and @xmath65 behave in the same way , for example @xmath66 as @xmath67 , corresponding to the degeneracy of the states @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "similar effects in chemical potentials have been observed in measurements of vertical quantum dots in magnetic fields @xcite and in calculations of elliptically deformed dots.@xcite due to the rather coarse spacing of our @xmath8-values in fig .",
    "[ che ] , all the deviations are not observable . a more detailed description as well as a comparison to elliptic dots follows below .    in fig .",
    "[ add ] we show the addition energies , @xmath70 ,        for @xmath71 .",
    "the spectra obtained with the sdft and vmc coincide well , especially for @xmath72 . in the case of a square dot ( @xmath14 ) , the magic configurations can be seen as large peaks in the spectrum . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the relatively large addition energy for @xmath73 corresponds to a half - filled shell according to hund s rule .",
    "the spectrum agrees well with the results of akbar and lee @xcite for a square dot of a similar size .    in general",
    ", the results for the rectangular quantum dot are very sensitive to the deformation . as @xmath8 increases ,",
    "the peaks for @xmath74 rapidly vanish but reform above @xmath75 . for @xmath76",
    "the addition energy oscillates more smoothly , and in dots with @xmath77 it varies relatively slowly , declining in the former and growing in the latter between @xmath78 .",
    "above @xmath79 the formation of an even - odd structure corresponds to the filling of states @xmath18 . in that regime ,",
    "the growing amplitude in the peaks reflects the increasing spacing between the single - electron eigenstates shown in fig .",
    "[ exact ] .",
    "it is intriguing to compare qualitatively the evolution of the spectra in the regime of @xmath67 to the experimental results of austing _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite there are two difficulties in the direct comparison .",
    "first , the experimental mesa is much larger than the area where the electrons are actually confined , causing uncertainty of the value for the deformation parameter .",
    "secondly , there are evidently irregularities in the experimental dots , leading to unexpected behavior in the spectrum as speculated by austing _",
    "@xcite in spite of these problems , we can generally find similarities in the spectra .",
    "compared with the elliptic case , there is more tendency of forming peaks for even @xmath4 in both the experiments and our approximation at @xmath67 .",
    "this may result from the higher symmetry of the elliptic than rectangular dot , discussed in the context of the single - electron spectrum in sec .",
    "[ model ] . of particular electron numbers ,",
    "the behavior of the curves for @xmath80 and 10 qualitatively agree , and the biggest difference is the rapid disappearance of the peak for @xmath73 at @xmath81 in the experiment .",
    "overall , our hard - wall approximation seems to be a slightly better approximation for rectangular - shaped quantum dots than the elliptic description in ref .   however , more accurate comparison than presented here would certainly require more measurements and over a wider range for @xmath8 .",
    "an ideal experimental setup would also contain a way to tune @xmath8 for a single dot , reducing the variation induced by using different dots for different @xmath8 .",
    "next we consider more carefully the effect of electron - electron interactions on the electronic structure . in fig .",
    "[ levspin ] we     interacting electrons for rectangular dots as a function of the deformation @xmath8.,width=313 ]    compare the non - interacting single - electron spectrum with the evolution of the total spin for even @xmath4 .",
    "due to hund s rule , we can see partial spin - polarization ( @xmath82 ) close to every degenerate point in the single - electron energy spectrum . in the case of a square",
    ", the @xmath82 ground state is found correctly for half - filled shells with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the spin state changes rapidly to @xmath85 as the dot is squeezed .",
    "the range of @xmath82 regimes is obviously directly proportional to the slope differences of the crossing eigenstates .",
    "the triple - crossing for @xmath86 at @xmath87 leads to two separate @xmath82 regimes around the degenerate point .",
    "in most cases , polarization occurs at higher @xmath8-values than the corresponding crossing of the non - interacting states .",
    "therefore , by taking the electron - electron interaction into account , the effective deformation of the rectangle is lower than that of the bare external potential .",
    "this is contrary to the result for elliptic dots obtained by lee _",
    "et al._,@xcite who concluded that the interactions tend to strengthen the bare potential by a factor of @xmath88 .",
    "intuitively , one would expect just an opposite behavior : in hard - wall rectangular dots the maximum electron density is pushed toward the shorter sides , whereas elliptic and harmonic confinements favor pronounced density at the center .",
    "we will present this tendency explicitly in sec .",
    "[ one ] .    as we show in fig .",
    "[ levspin ] , every @xmath82 state is bracketed by spin - density - wave - like solutions . in these regimes , the exchange - energy gained in the polarized state is relatively close to the cost paid by occupying the higher energy state . by breaking the internal spin - symmetry , the dot gains exchange - correlation energy which preserves it at the paramagnetic @xmath85 state instead of following hund s rule with @xmath82 .",
    "a similar behavior was found in the study of elliptic dots for certain configurations.@xcite in the resulting sdw - like solution , the spin - up and spin - down densities are symmetrically coupled with each other as shown in fig .",
    "[ sdw ] for a 12-electron dot        with @xmath89 and @xmath60 , corresponding to two symmetry - broken regimes . in both cases",
    "there are six maxima and six minima in the spin - polarization but the shapes of the waves are totally different .",
    "besides electron densities , it is interesting to consider the development of the kohn - sham energy levels near the degenerate point . in fig .",

    "doubly degenerate levels are denoted by ( 2 ) and the occupied states by ( o).,width=302 ]    for an eight - electron dot with @xmath90 and @xmath91 . as can be seen in in fig .",
    "[ levspin ] , these values correspond to states @xmath85 , sdw , @xmath82 , and sdw , respectively . in the sdw states ,",
    "the fermi gap is just large enough to prevent the polarization on the highest occupied level .",
    "the phenomenon has an analogy in molecular systems , known as the spontaneous jahn - teller effect:@xcite any non - linear molecular system in a degenerate electronic state will be unstable and will undergo distortion to form a system of lower symmetry and lower energy . in this particular case , however , the commonly used argument that the symmetry - broken state would make the electronic structure more stable by the enlargement of the fermi gap is not precisely valid , as can be concluded from fig .",
    "it is more or less a matter of preserving the @xmath85 state against the transition to the @xmath82 state , representing here a more stable configuration .",
    "the sdw state is a mixture of different @xmath85 states , and there has been a lot of debate if this mixed state is physically meaningful.@xcite in our forthcoming studies which include the exact diagonalization results for @xmath73 , we hope to enlighten the validity of the above - represented mixed states for rectangular quantum dots . until now , however , symmetry - broken solutions have shown their eligibility in several systems . in parabolic quantum dots , for example , the sdw state was found to agree astonishingly well with vmc results in the weak - confinement limit,@xcite especially when the latest 2d - lsda functional was used.@xcite in our previous study , we showed that in polygonal quantum dots the breaking of the spin - symmetry precedes the complete wigner molecule formation at low densities.@xcite quantum wires , studied in the context of sdw solutions by reimann _",
    "et al._,@xcite represent another interesting example that we discuss in the next section .      as the deformation is made larger , electrons in the dot",
    "become gradually restricted in the lowest energy state in the _ y _ direction , i.e. , only states @xmath18 are filled .",
    "this corresponds to the quasi - one - dimensional limit and a quantum - wire - like electronic structure.@xcite beyond this limit , we find two phases directly observable in the electronic density .",
    "first , there is a charge - density wave ( cdw ) with @xmath92 peaks and preserved spin - symmetry . as the deformation or the dot size",
    "is increased further , a spin - density wave appears , consisting of interlocked spin - up and spin - down contributions and resulting in a wigner - molecule - like electron density with @xmath4 peaks . in fig .",
    "[ wires ] we show examples of both cases     in ( a , b ) and @xmath93 in ( c , d ) .",
    "doubly degenerate functions are denoted by the numbers ( 2).,width=321 ]    with electron density profiles and the corresponding kohn - sham eigenfunctions . in both wires , the area is still @xmath94 , corresponding to @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the 12-electron wire with @xmath98 retains the spin - symmetry and the ks eigenfunctions are doubly degenerate . on the contrary",
    ", the 8-electron wire with @xmath99 has a broken spin - symmetry . in this case",
    "the single - electron ks eigenfunctions are mirror images of each other , and therefore the ks energy levels are still doubly degenerate . due to the dominating coulomb interaction",
    ", the lowest ks eigenfunctions correspond to localized states near the ends , having @xmath100 lower energy than the other occupied levels with a mutual separation of @xmath101 .",
    "compared to this , the fermi gap is particularly large , @xmath102 . in this sense ,",
    "the breaking of the spin - symmetry resembles two - dimensional systems in the low - density limit.@xcite    next we vary both the value of @xmath8 as well as the density parameter @xmath103 in order to examine the transition point between the two phases discussed above . as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] for @xmath73 and @xmath104 , the @xmath103 value needed for the deformation        to form a sdw decreases as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "the behavior is rather insensitive to @xmath4 ; larger electron numbers also qualitatively follow the presented curves with the same tendency of moving slightly up in @xmath103 with increasing electron number , which may arise from our definition for @xmath103 .",
    "we point out that beyond the phase separation , i.e. , at particularly large @xmath105 values , there is also a transition to a fully spin - polarized state not shown in the figure .",
    "for example , for a four - electron wire with @xmath98 , this occurs at @xmath106 . in three - dimensional metal nanowires ,",
    "sdft calculations have similarly been shown to lead to spontaneous polarization in zero magnetic field at a critical radius of the wire.@xcite recent conductance measurements , performed for ultra - low - disorder quantum wires , support this phenomenon.@xcite another remark concerning fig .",
    "[ phase ] is the fact that the ability to reach the quasi-1d - limit requires naturally smaller electron number than there are available lowest ( @xmath107 ) states to be occupied .",
    "this condition can be easily estimated from the non - interacting single - electron spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ exact ] ) .",
    "comparison between our rectangular hard - wall quantum wires and elliptical wires with harmonic confinement studied by reimann _",
    "@xcite reveals some noticeable differences .",
    "first , our lda ( spin - compensated ) solution always has a cdw with @xmath92 pronounced maxima , contrary to the elliptic case with a smooth electron density .",
    "secondly , in rectangular wires the total density distribution is remarkably concentrated at the ends due to the dominating lowest ks eigenstates shown in fig .",
    "[ wires ] .",
    "the opposite distribution in these two geometries is a direct consequence of the difference in the confining potential : in the elliptic wire , the bowl - like restriction along the wire accumulates a pronounced density at the center , whereas in the hard - wall wire the coulomb interaction pushes the dominant distribution to the ends .",
    "increasing @xmath8 or @xmath103 emphasizes this tendency of localization .",
    "it is noticeable that the sdw formation is the origin of both the particularly large fermi gap and the strong localization of the lowest eigenfunctions .",
    "we have investigated the electronic properties of hard - wall rectangular quantum dots .",
    "most calculations have been performed with a symmetry - unrestricted sdft scheme in real - space . for the addition energy spectra",

    "is troublesome but we find tentative common features in the addition energy spectra .",
    "close to the degenerate points where hund s rule applies , the states with partial polarization are bracketed by unstable sdw - like solutions . the effective deformation is generally lower than that of a bare potential , but the general picture follows the non - interacting single - electron spectrum . beyond the quasi-1d - limit we find very stable sdw states and extremely strong localization near the ends of the wire , arising from the shape of the hard - wall confinement .        for an overview , see e.g. r. c. ashoori , nature , * 379 * , 413 ( 1996 ) ; m. a. kastner , physics today * 46 * , 24 ( 1993 ) ; p. l. mceuen , science , * 278 * , 1729 ( 1997 ) . s. m. reimann and m. manninen , rev .",

    "<S> we study the ground state properties of rectangular quantum dots by using the spin - density - functional theory and quantum monte carlo methods . the dot geometry is determined by an infinite hard - wall potential to enable comparison to manufactured , rectangular - shaped quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the electronic structure is very sensitive to the deformation , and at realistic sizes the non - interacting picture determines the general behavior . </S>",
    "<S> however , close to the degenerate points where hund s rule applies , we find spin - density - wave - like solutions bracketing the partially polarized states . in the quasi - one - dimensional limit </S>",
    "<S> we find permanent charge - density waves , and at a sufficiently large deformation or low density , there are strongly localized stable states with a broken spin - symmetry . </S>"
