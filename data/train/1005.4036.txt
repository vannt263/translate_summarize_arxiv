    "the origin of grbs is cosmological , as determined from the measurement of their redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and in many cases , their host galaxies have been identified ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "their distances imply the release of large amounts of energy ( @xmath10 ) in a short time - scale , which suggests that the origin of these phenomena could be associated to the accretion of matter onto a compact object @xcite .",
    "two populations of grbs are apparent from the distribution of their duration @xcite .",
    "those lasting less than @xmath11 are known as short grbs , while longer events are called long grbs ( lgrbs ) .",
    "these are more frequently observed and more precisely located , which makes their properties better known .",
    "lgrbs are always found in host galaxies with ongoing star formation activity @xcite , and some of them were observed to be associated with type ib / c core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the progenitors of lgrbs are massive stars .",
    "stellar evolution models have tried to provide a consistent scenario where a lgrb can develop .",
    "the result is the so called _ collapsar model _",
    "@xcite , in which this phenomenon is produced during the collapse of a massive star , due to the accretion of part of the envelope onto the recently formed black hole .",
    "nevertheless , the properties of lgrb progenitors ( mass , metallicity , rotation velocity , binarity , etc . ) are still a matter of discussion .",
    "lgrbs have been associated to single massive stars @xcite , perhaps in metallicity biased environments @xcite , and also to stars in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the importance of understanding the nature of the lgrb progenitors is beyond the interest of only stellar evolution and black hole formation . given their connection to massive stars and their large luminosities , lgrbs might be a powerful tool to investigate the star formation in the early universe , at redshifts for which standard tools become ineffective ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the knowledge of the properties of the stellar progenitors would allow the assessment of possible biases originated when lgrbs are used as tracers of star formation .",
    "several authors suggest that the cosmic lgrb rate does not follow the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of their data requires the assumption of a differential evolution of the comoving lgrb rate density with respect to the comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) density .",
    "the same conclusion arises from the work of @xcite , who show that the luminosity function of lgrb hosts differs from that of core - collapse supernovae hosts , which are considered unbiased tracers of star formation . according to these authors",
    ", the lgrb host luminosity function can be reproduced by requiring lgrb progenitors to have metal abundances lower than that of the sun .",
    "an indirect procedure to investigate lgrb progenitors is to characterise the stellar populations of their host galaxies . given the connection between lgrbs and star formation , galaxy formation models can be used to assess the validity of lgrb progenitor models , comparing their predictions about the properties of these stellar populations to host galaxies observations .",
    "recent works such as that of @xcite , suggest that there is a strong relation between star formation and nuclear activity in a galaxy with its environment , at constant stellar mass .",
    "hence , the environment of host galaxies might constitute an independent probe for progenitor models .",
    "observational works on host galaxies environment are still inconclusive on whether host galaxies inhabit regions with certain characteristics @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that host galaxies are field galaxies , while @xcite find that a considerable fraction of their sample of 42 host galaxies shows evidence of interaction with other galaxies .",
    "the question of whether there is a connection between the occurrence of a lgrb and the local density of galaxies remains unanswered .",
    "since galaxy formation is a highly non - linear process , the properties of host galaxies predicted by different progenitor scenarios are better studied by means of cosmological numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite use hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to identify a galaxy population whose properties reproduce the observed ones .",
    "according to these authors , the luminosity distribution of host galaxies is reproduced if galaxies are required to have high star formation efficiency .",
    "however , their simulations do not make any prediction on the properties of the lgrb progenitors .",
    "@xcite developed a monte carlo code to simulate the production of lgrbs in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation , assuming that their progenitors are massive stars as proposed by the collapsar model .",
    "these authors follow the lgrb production as the structure forms and evolves in the universe .",
    "their results suggest that lgrb progenitors would be low metallicity stars ( @xmath12 ) , and hence lgrbs would be biased tracers of star formation principally at low redshift .",
    "however , their simulations explore a small volume of @xmath13 dominated by field galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite have constructed a simulated population of host galaxies based on the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation of @xcite applied to cosmological simulations developed by @xcite .",
    "these simulations describe a larger volume of the universe ( a square box of @xmath14 in a side ) .",
    "@xcite explore three lgrb progenitor models based on the collapsar model , one of them assuming a given stellar mass value and an age cut - off and the other two also including metallicity cut - offs .",
    "these authors find that models with very low metallicity progenitors ( @xmath15 ) could explain the luminosities , colours and metallicities of the observed host galaxies .",
    "their results support previous claims of lgrbs being biased tracers of the star formation .",
    "clearly , the use of larger simulations with better resolution and more detailed descriptions of the physical processes driving the dynamical , chemical and star formation histories of galaxies allows a better modelling of the host galaxies of lgrbs .",
    "however , an important aspect that should not be disregarded is that , for a proper comparison with observed host galaxies , the effects of the detectability of these galaxies must be taken into account . and",
    "this is the main contribution of our work where we developed an observational pipeline which allows us to mimic , at least in part , biases affecting the observations . with this new tool",
    "we build an observable host galaxy catalogue which can be more fairly compared to current available observations .    in this work",
    ", we develop a semi - analytical model for the host galaxies of lgrbs adopting the collapsar model for the progenitor stars .",
    "we apply it to one of the largest cosmological simulations available , the _ millennium simulation _ @xcite .",
    "the _ millennium simulation _ follows the evolution of dark matter in a box of @xmath16 in a side , hence providing a cosmologically representative volume a factor of 64 larger than that of @xcite and factor of @xmath17 larger than that of @xcite .",
    "we take the galaxy catalogue built up by @xcite , who describe the evolution of baryonic matter including star formation , active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback . using the star formation and chemical properties of galaxies in this catalogue to implement different lgrb progenitor scenarios ,",
    "we determine the properties of the overall host galaxy population and its environment .",
    "we compute the detectability of the host galaxies in order to compare the predictions of these scenarios to the observations compiled by @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as following . in section  [ sim ] , we briefly describe the cosmological simulation and semi - analytic galaxy catalogue used in our work . in section  [ mod ] ,",
    "we develop our implementation of lgrb progenitor scenarios .",
    "sections  [ hgs ] and [ env ] show our results on host galaxy properties and environment , respectively .",
    "finally , section  [ con ] presents our conclusions .",
    "the _ millennium simulation _ @xcite is one of the largest cosmological simulations of structure formation publicly available .",
    "it describes the evolution of the cold dark matter while the baryonic matter can be included via semi - analytic models on top of the numerical simulation .",
    "the _ millennium simulation _ describes the formation of structure tracking @xmath18 dark matter particles of mass @xmath19 distributed in a cubic region of 500 @xmath20 side , using the @xmath21 cosmogony .",
    "the adopted cosmological parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where the hubble constant is @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "these parameters are chosen in consistency with results obtained by the joint analysis of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite .",
    "the simulation was performed using a modified version of gadget-2 hydrodynamical code @xcite . a _ friends - of - friends _ ( fof ) algorithm identified non - linear dark matter haloes within the simulation in an automatic manner .",
    "two particles belong to the same halo if their separation is less than @xmath29 times the mean separation between particles .",
    "only groups of more than @xmath30 particles are identified as haloes .",
    "this restriction sets a lower limit on the mass of a halo of @xmath31 .",
    "substructures orbiting within each virialized halo are identified applying a subfind algorithm @xcite .",
    "each dark matter halo has a central ( type 0 ) galaxy and one or more satellite galaxies .",
    "satellites were at some point central galaxies of smaller haloes which suffered a merger with the halo their currently inhabit .",
    "there are two types of satellite galaxies , type 1 galaxies are located at the centre of a subhalo associated with a fof group , while type 2 galaxies have lost their dark matter subhalo after falling onto a more massive halo .",
    "mean properties of synthetic galaxies ( e.g. sfr , stellar mass , gas mass , metallicity ) are obtained by applying semi - analytic models to the structure formation simulation @xcite .",
    "essentially , semi - analytical models describe the collapse of baryonic matter following dark matter haloes . after collapsing",
    ", the gas cools and gravitational instabilities produce episodes of star formation . to reproduce observations , models incorporate photoionization processes in the intergalactic medium , the growth of supermassive black holes during galactic mergers , supernova and agn feedback , star formation rate enhancement in mergers , and formation of heavy elements for each formed stellar population .",
    "the galaxy catalogue we use in this work is that of @xcite .",
    "there is recent evidence for an excessive reddening of type 2 galaxies @xcite which might be due to the poor physical treatment of this type of galaxies . in order to avoid spurious trends ,",
    "we exclude type 2 galaxies from our analysis in section  [ mod ] and section  [ hgs ] .",
    "however , type 2 galaxies ought to be included in the environmental analysis performed in section  [ env ] in order to correctly trace the underlying mass distribution .",
    "hence , the catalogue of @xcite provides us with the spatial galaxy distribution , their stellar masses , dark matter haloes , star formation activity , colours , luminosities and mean metallicities .",
    "regarding the latter , the public catalogue makes available the mean metallicity of the cold gas component and of the stellar population as a whole ( i.e. averaged over new and old stars in a galaxy ) .",
    "therefore , as a proxy for the metallicity of the lgrb progenitors , we take the mean metallicity of the cold gas component at the time these stars were born . because the @xcite model assumes instantaneous recycling , this metallicity is slightly higher than that of the newly born stars , but this correction is negligible compared to the uncertainties in the measured metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we consider two scenarios for lgrb production , both of them based on the collapsar model @xcite . in our scenario",
    "i we take as lgrb progenitors all stars above a certain minimum mass @xmath32 , with no other restriction whatsoever . in this scenario",
    "lgrbs are unbiased tracers of star formation .",
    "accordingly , we obtain the intrinsic lgrb rate in a given galaxy @xmath33 at a particular redshift @xmath34 as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the lower and upper mass cut - offs of the imf @xmath38 given by @xcite . according to eqn .",
    "[ rateint ] , the production of lgrbs is not delayed with respect to the starburst that created the progenitor stars , which is justified because in the collapsar model only massive stars are lgrb progenitors .    in our scenario",
    "ii , we assume that only massive stars ( @xmath39 ) below some metallicity threshold ( @xmath40 ) are able to produce lgrbs , as in the progenitor models of @xcite or @xcite . as explained before , we take the mean metallicity of cold gas in each galaxy as representative of the metallicity of the progenitor stars .",
    "the consequences of this hypothesis will be discussed in later sections . in this scenario ,",
    "the intrinsic lgrb rate is given by eqn .",
    "[ rateint ] for galaxies @xmath33 with metallicity @xmath41 , and is null for those with @xmath42 .",
    "three realizations of this scenario were computed , adopting @xmath43 ( scenarios ii.1 , ii.2 and ii.3 , respectively ) .      given a metallicity threshold , we adjusted the only free parameter of our scenarios ( @xmath32 ) to reproduce the lgrb rate measured by the batse experiment .",
    "for this purpose , we took the off - line grb search of @xcite , which detected 3475 grbs with @xmath44 during a live - time of @xmath45 ( 70 per cent of the @xmath46 that batse was active ) , scanning 67 per cent of the sky .",
    "this translates into a full - sky lgrb rate of @xmath47 above the threshold of the off - line search .",
    "the choice of this particular experiment was motivated by its good statistics and the availability of an accurate model for its detection efficiency .    to obtain the observable rate predicted by a given scenario , we first compute the comoving lgrb rate density for each redshift as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the comoving volume of the _",
    "millennium simulation_. the full - sky observed lgrb rate is then    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    is the derivative of the comoving volume with respect to @xmath34 at fixed solid angle , @xmath52 is the maximum redshift of the simulation , @xmath53 the luminosity distance and @xmath54 the hubble constant at redshift @xmath34 , and @xmath55 the probability of detecting a lgrb at redshift @xmath34 with batse ( i.e. the probability that a particular lgrb has a peak flux above the experiment threshold ) .",
    "the integration was performed numerically , and the described procedure iterated over @xmath32 , until agreement with the observed rate was attained .",
    "the value of @xmath56 depends on the lgrb luminosity function and spectrum .",
    "it was computed using a monte - carlo scheme to simulate , at a given redshift , a large population of lgrbs with different luminosities and spectra .",
    "then , their photon fluxes in the batse energy band were estimated . for each lgrb in this population , a second monte - carlo procedure rejected those events which would be undetectable , taking into account the trigger efficiency of the @xcite off - line search .",
    "if the lgrb emission were isotropic , the fraction of retained lgrbs would directly give the detection probability due to the off - line search threshold . to account for the beamed emission of lgrbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and assuming that the distribution of jet opening angles is independent of the lgrb luminosity , spectrum and redshift , we obtain @xmath55 by multiplying this fraction by the mean beaming fraction of the jets @xmath57 .",
    "the luminosity function and spectral parameters distributions were taken from @xcite .",
    "this procedure not only allows us to mimic the observational process but also has provided us with estimates of the minimum mass for the progenitor stars .",
    "the values of @xmath32 obtained , in solar masses , are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for scenarios i , ii.1 , ii.2 and ii.3 , respectively ; the uncertainties reflect poissonian errors in the number of observed lgrbs ( see also table 1 ) .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      a meaningful definition of a lgrb host galaxy in our scenarios is not as straightforward as it might seem at first sight . the nave definition of a host galaxy , at a given redshift @xmath34 , as being any galaxy @xmath33 with a lgbr rate of @xmath63 ( or identically , @xmath64 ) is not useful because the resulting host population would include galaxies with arbitrarily low lgrb rates .",
    "low rates are better understood in statistical terms , as very low probabilities of producing a lgrb per unit time .",
    "this implies that the corresponding galaxies have a low probability of being observed as host galaxies .",
    "hence , this nave definition would generate a host galaxies sample biased to low sfr galaxies . to fix this problem",
    ", the definition of a host galaxy could be based on the number of lgrbs @xmath65 produced in each galaxy during a time interval @xmath66 in its rest frame , so that host galaxies are only those with @xmath67 , as in @xcite .",
    "however this cut - off , and the resulting population , would be dependent on the more or less arbitrary choice of @xmath66 .    given the above arguments , we preferred instead a probabilistic approach , defining the likelihood of a galaxy being observed as a lgrb host .",
    "this likelihood is then used as a weight to compute the properties of the observable host galaxies sample , which would be in this way comparable to the observed sample . for a galaxy to be detected as a host",
    "at least one lgrb must be detected within it by a high - energy observatory .",
    "then , the galaxy itself must be detected , usually by optical / nir telescopes .",
    "we would treat the biases introduced by each of these observations separately .    to model the first bias",
    ", we compute the probability of detecting at least one lgrb within it by any of the high - energy observatories monitoring grbs . given that event",
    "detection processes follow poissonian statistics , if @xmath68 is the contribution of galaxy @xmath33 at redshift @xmath34 to the lgrb rate observed by experiment @xmath69 , the probability of observing at least one lgrb in a galaxy is    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the time interval of the lgrb search conducted by experiment @xmath69 .",
    "[ phg ] assumes that the searches by different observatories are independent .",
    "previous works estimate the intrinsic lgrb rate in a typical galaxy to be of the order of @xmath72 @xcite , hence the lgrb rate observed in the galaxy by any mission must be lower than this value .",
    "given that current searches for lgrbs have spanned a few years , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , which means that the likelihood of a galaxy being observed as a host is proportional to its contribution to the mean _ observed _ number of lgrbs ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the sky coverage of the experiment @xmath69 .",
    "note that , for a fixed @xmath34 , cosmological and observatory dependent factors in eqn .",
    "[ rateobsgal ] become constant , independently of the number of observatories considered , and cancel out in the normalization of the weights .",
    "this means that when computing mean hg properties such as mass or sfr as a function of @xmath34 , the first bias can be modeled simply by weighting the corresponding properties of each galaxy by its _",
    "intrinsic _ lgrb rate .    in the computation of the integrated properties of the whole population of host galaxies ( like the integrated mass distribution , for example ) , also the effects of volume variation , time dilation and detectability of the different observatories must be taken into account ( pellizza et al . in preparation ) . in this case",
    "it is better to compute first the mass distribution observed by each experiment at each redshift @xmath34 , weighting the galaxies in the corresponding snapshot by @xmath77 .",
    "second , the integration in @xmath34 can be performed for each experiment , and the resulting distribution can be normalized .",
    "this has the advantage of avoiding the use of the values of @xmath71 and @xmath76 , which are poorly known for some of the observatories that detected the lgrbs in the sample of @xcite .",
    "only @xmath78 for each experiment is needed , which is computed as described in sect .",
    "[ obsrate ] for @xmath56 .",
    "finally , these distributions can be combined into a single one by adding them , previously scaled to the number of lgrbs detected by each observatory .",
    "the relevant data for computing the detectability were taken from @xcite for batse , @xcite for _ swift _ , @xcite for _ beppo - sax _",
    ", @xcite for _ hete-2 _ and @xcite for _ ulysses_. these experiments detected 36 of the 38 lgrbs in the sample of @xcite .",
    "for statistical reasons , only experiments that detected at least five lgrbs in the sample were considered .",
    "konus-_wind _ and _ near_-xgrs were discarded because all their lgrbs were observed also by other experiments above . to be consistent ,",
    "the observed mass distribution to which the model predictions were compared was constructed from the data of @xcite by adding the individual distributions observed by each experiment .",
    "the second bias is more difficult to model .",
    "given that the search for host galaxies is guided by the discovery of the lgrbs themselves and usually done with a variety of different telescopes and detectors , in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and with different sensitivities , the biases introduced are unclear .",
    "galaxies with surface brightness below the detectability threshold of available instruments could introduce a bias towards low metallicity galaxies .",
    "an extra problem could be caused by dust obscuration which could affect the detection of the afterglows and produce a bias towards high metallicity galaxies @xcite .",
    "hence , at least these two effects might combine themselves to determine the detectability of a host galaxy .",
    "considering also the fact that we have only access to the public galaxy catalogue of the _ millennium simulation _ which provides only mean global properties and magnitudes , we adopt the observed integrated stellar mass distribution as a tool to apply the combined effect of observational biases to the simulated galaxy sample .",
    "we use the fact that the observed integrated stellar mass distribution has been affected by observational biases although we can not disentangle their individual effects .",
    "hence , we require the simulated lgrb hosts to reproduce the observed stellar mass distribution in order to build up the observable simulated lgrb hosts . the procedure is explained in detail in next section .",
    "note that , hereafterin , we will discuss the trends of the observable simulated hosts and the general galaxy population .",
    "the former can be compared to the current observed hosts , but , if this later sample changes due to better or different observational techniques , our simulated sample should be also consistently modified to match the new observed stellar mass distribution .",
    "the largest and most comprehensively uniform sample of host galaxy properties available at present is that compiled by @xcite .",
    "stellar masses , star formation rates , metallicities , absolute magnitudes and colours of 46 observed host galaxies up to @xmath79 were obtained by these authors comparing their spectral energy distributions to those of synthetic stellar populations , using the method described in @xcite .",
    "a key point of our models is that we require the stellar mass distribution of the predicted host galaxies to match that of the observed host galaxies .",
    "the stellar mass is adopted as the property to be reproduced by the models since it is now widely accepted that stellar mass is a more fundamental quantity for galaxies than luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it could be possible that those lgrb events with no detected hosts occured in very low surface brightness galaxies and hence , with low stellar masses . as mentioned before the effects of dust could also prevent the detection of events in high metallicity ( and dusty ) galaxies . in our models",
    "these host galaxies exist ( and are part of the global galaxy population ) but the observability cut - off has been determined by using the current observed stellar mass distribution .",
    "[ mass ] shows the distribution of stellar masses of observed host galaxies constructed from the data of @xcite , together with those predicted by our scenarios .    as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ mass ] , the scenario which best reproduces the observed stellar mass distribution is that with @xmath80 ( scenario ii.3 , see also table 1 ) .",
    "lower metallicity thresholds predict lower observed stellar masses for the host galaxies , while no metallicity threshold ( scenario i ) predicts larger ones . in the sample of @xcite",
    ", we find that @xmath81 per cent of the studied galaxies have stellar masses over the range @xmath62 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the probability of getting a host galaxy within this stellar mass range in scenario ii.3 is 88 per cent , while for scenarios i , ii.1 and ii.2 it is 70 , 2 , and 43 per cent , respectively . then we conclude that scenario ii.3 predictions agree fairly well with observations while others fail , and therefore in the following sections , we will focus only on this scenario .",
    "we stress the fact that its predictions include the effects of host galaxies observability , hence , a proper comparison with observations can be made . in order to contribute to the understanding of the nature of lgrb host galaxies",
    ", we will also compare these predictions with the properties ( not weighted by host galaxy observability ) of both the sample of all galaxies with mean cold gas metallicities below @xmath82 ( hereafter low metallicity sample ) and the complete galaxy population of the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "as a first step towards understanding the nature of host galaxies , we analyse their stellar masses as a function of redshift . as shown in fig .",
    "[ massred ] , the mean stellar mass of the host galaxies as a function of redshift predicted by scenario ii.3 reproduces the observed mean trend quite well . from this figure",
    ", we can also see that host galaxies are , on average , more massive than galaxies in the complete galaxy population while the latter are more massive than those in the low metallicity sample .",
    "this can be understood taking into account that the host galaxy observability is a strong function of the star formation rate , and that the complete galaxy population in the catalogue of @xcite follows a mass - metallicity relationship ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "then , the cut - off adopted for the mean cold gas metallicity to reproduce the observed stellar mass distribution implies a cut - off in stellar mass since low metallicity galaxies are , on average , less massive than the general galaxy population ( see also fig .",
    "[ mass ] ) .",
    "however , as the observability of a host galaxy depends strongly on its star formation activity and most of the small galaxies have low star formation rates , the observable host galaxies tend to be , on average , the more massive ones among them . as a result , our observable sample tends to be populated by systems more massive than those in the low metallicity sample or in the complete galaxy population .      in fig .",

    "these have higher sfr than the mean of the complete galaxy population , and much higher than that of the low metallicity sample .",
    "the good agreement between our scenario ii.3 and observations suggests that the observed host galaxies are biased towards galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath83 , high star formation activity and relatively low gas metal content , compared to the mean properties of the complete galaxy population at a given @xmath34 .        regarding the mean specific sfr ( ssfr ) , defined as the ratio between the sfr and the stellar mass of a given galaxy ( fig .  [ gssfr ] ) ,",

    "this can be understood because , at higher redshift , galaxies have larger gas reservoirs which can feed stronger star formation activity and are , on average , less chemically enriched . at low redshift ,",

    "we note that the dispersion is approximately 0.5 dex around the @xmath120 mean stellar mass .",

    "the comparison of the mean metallicity of host galaxies predicted by our model with grb - dlas observations suggests that lgrbs might be produced in stars of even lower metallicity as pointed out by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "hence , results should be taken with caution .",
    "5 .   for @xmath123 ,",
    "host galaxies seem to be slightly more likely to be in pairs than galaxies belonging to the other samples . there is , however , a change of behaviour for @xmath124 , where the at least 50 per cent of the host galaxies seems to have their closest neighbour further away than galaxies in the complete population , but closer than galaxies in the low metallicity sample .",
    "we highlight that we are considering neighbouring galaxies of a mass above @xmath125 .",
    "this limit is set by the numerical resolution of the _ millennium simulation_. lower mass companions could also imprint morphological perturbations and trigger star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but we can not pursue this analysis further on with this galaxy catalogue . 6 .",
    "regarding global environment , our model suggests that , at @xmath108 , observable host galaxies would preferentially inhabit environments of similar density to those populated by the general population and of slightly higher density than those inhabited by the low metallicity sample . towards @xmath126 ,",
    "observable host galaxies tend to be progressively located in less dense environments , which becomes as subdense as the regions where low metallicity galaxies reside ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "this result is consistent with observable host galaxies being systems with mean stellar masses approximately constant , regardless of the age of the universe .",
    "our results are mainly a consequence of the joint requirements to have high star formation activity to ensure observability and to reproduce the current distribution of stellar masses of observed host galaxies . however , within the current constrains , galaxies with high masses would be too metal - rich to produce lgrbs and low mass systems would have low probability of being observed . if the observed sample were modified by the incorporation of other galaxies , for example dusty hosts , then our model would need to be readjusted accordingly .",
