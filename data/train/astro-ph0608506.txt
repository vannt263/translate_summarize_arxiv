    "direct imaging and characterization ( through low resolution spectroscopy ) of extrasolar terrestrial planets ( etps ) is an exciting but challenging scientific application of coronagraphy . while the angular separation is well within the reach of a mid - sized telescope in the visible , the high star - planet contrast ( about @xmath1 in the visible ) requires a wavefront stability that can only be obtained with a space telescope .",
    "the low apparent luminosity of an earth - like planet ( @xmath2 for an earth at 10pc ) requires the precious planetary photons to be well isolated from the stellar light ; otherwise , photon noise from the stellar light drives the exposure time unreasonably high and speckles from the stellar image , if not calibrated , prevent detection . a system capable of delivering @xmath1 contrast at less than 0.1  is therefore required for efficient detection and characterization of etps around a reasonably large ( @xmath330 ) sample of nearby stars .",
    "the purpose of this work is to identify and quantify how fundamental physics imposes hard limits on what coronagraphs can achieve for the detection of terrestrial planets , and to compare these limits with what existing coronagraph designs can achieve .",
    "coronagraphs designs simulated in this work are introduced and  [ sec : existingc ] , where they are tentatively grouped in a four families . the configuration adopted for each design in this study",
    "is also described . in  [ sec : idealcase ] , a metric to quantify coronagraph performance is proposed , allowing existing coronagraph designs to be evaluated in the `` ideal '' case ( monochromatic light , unresolved central star ) .",
    "a theoretical limit of coronagraph performance in this ideal case is also derived . in the next 2 sections ,",
    "we closely look at the most fundamental ( unavoidable ) deviations from this ideal case , and their effects on coronagraphic performance : stellar angular size (  [ sec : stellarsize ] ) and presence of a zodiacal / exozodiacal background (  [ sec : zodi ] ) .",
    "finally , a detailed simulation of coronagraphic observations of a sample of nearby stars is performed in  [ sec : montecarlo ] to derive the efficiency of coronagraphs for detection of etps .",
    "the coronagraphs studied in this work ( see table [ tab : coronagraphs ] ) are all the coronagraphs known to us to theoretically achieve a @xmath1 psf contrast within 5 @xmath4 of the central source , as illustrated in figure [ fig : psfs ] .",
    "it is impossible to compare all the different kinds of coronagraph designs that have been suggested in all their details . but without these concrete examples , we could not communicate our new perspective and illustrate what are the fundamental physical effects limiting coronagraphic performance .",
    "we offer this brief summary of previous work as historical background prior to using these designs .",
    "more detailed descriptions of these coronagraphs can be found in the references given in this section .",

    "we note that another coronagraph , the @xmath5 order band limited coronagraph ( see  [ ssec : lyot ] ) could be designed to perform the same pupil shear and nulling operations .",
    "both designs are simply two different optical implementations of the same principle , and are referred to as vnc / bl4(1 ) in this paper .",
    "* psc : in the pupil swapping coronagraph @xcite , parts of the pupils are geometrically swapped prior to destructive interferometric combination , thus avoiding the throughput loss due to the shear in the vnc . the psc design considered in this work is the @xmath5 order psc described in @xcite .",
    "the pupil complex amplitude can be modified to yield a psf suitable for high contrast imaging , a property used by many coronagraph concepts .",
    "apodization can be performed by a pupil plane amplitude mask ( conventional pupil apodization - cpa ) , which can be continuous @xcite or binary @xcite .",
    "apodization by mach - zehnder type pupil plane interferometry was also suggested by @xcite to produce a continuous apodization , but is not explored in this work .    within the cpa `` family '' ,",
    "we adopt for our comparative study a prolate spheroidal apodized pupil design @xcite , optimally tuned , according to the performance criteria defined in  [ sec : usefult ] , for a @xmath25 angular separation . in this design",
    ", the apodizer transmits 8% of the light , and at @xmath25 separation , exactly half of this light is detectable according the the criteria defined in  [ sec : usefult ] .",
    "this apodization is nearly identical to the general prolate apodization function shown in figure 8 of @xcite .    in cpas ,",
    "tradeoffs exist between iwa , throughput and `` discovery space '' ( fraction of the field of view usable for planet detection ) .",
    "a description of these tradeoffs can be found in @xcite , and they have been extensively explored for the design of binary masks / shaped pupils @xcite .",
    "for example , in the checkerboard - mask design proposed in figure 1 of @xcite , the psf surface brightness reaches @xmath26 at @xmath27 , but at this separation , the companion needs to be on the diagonal to be observed , and only a quarter of its light then falls in a `` black '' quadrant . in this particular small - iwa design , at 2.8 @xmath4 , the peak throughput is then 3.8% for a square pupil , and the radially averaged throughput is @xmath32% . at large ( @xmath28 ) separation , the average and peak throughputs are 15.1% .",
    "our prolate spheroidal apodization is not the optimal design if peak throughput is to be maximized ( in this case , the `` single prolate '' shaped pupil described in @xcite seems much superior ) .",
    "our choice is therefore not optimal if the companion s position is previously known , in which case it could be intentionally placed at a given position angle .",
    "binary pupil masks have the advantage of being achromatic and significantly easier to manufacture than continuous transmission masks .",
    "this technological advantage however comes at a non - negligible cost in planet detection performance :    * in the psf delivered by a non - obstructed , non - apodized circular aperture ( airy pattern ) , 84% of the energy transmitted by the pupil is contained in the central diffraction spot ; if the pupil is apodized with a continuous mask , this fraction is close to 100% ( but the spot is larger and less light is transmitted by the mask ) . in the psf delivered by binary apodization masks ,",
    "this fraction is typically about 50% : there is a factor @xmath29 difference between the mask throughput and the `` airy throughput '' @xcite useful for detection . within the central diffraction spot of a planet",
    "s image , the planet flux is proportional to the airy throughput while the background light contribution is proportional to the mask throughput .",
    "binary masks therefore `` amplify '' the amount of background light mixed with the planet image .",
    "this effect , discussed in  [ sec : def ] is also found in sparse aperture interferometers , where additional background light is collected from the secondary lobes . *",
    "the difference between mask throughput and airy throughput is diffracted in regions of the psf where planet detection is impossible . in a properly designed mask",
    ", this unwanted light avoids a large central region around the psf s center .    as the number of openings or slits in a binary mask increases ,",
    "these two effects become less of a concern , and the mask asymptotically becomes identical to a continuous mask .",
    "if only one half of the focal plane is considered , an amplitude pupil apodization can be replaced by a phase - only apodization ( pupil phase apodization , ppa ) , just as phase corrections in the pupil can only cancel focal plane speckles in one half of the field of view . high contrast imaging with phase apodization",
    "was proposed by @xcite , who found solutions for broadband imaging and obtained contrast / throughput performances similar to amplitude apodization designs ( although only over a quarter of the field of view ) .",
    "@xcite independently computed a ppa solution for the hubble space telescope pupil to suppress diffraction in half of the field of view .",
    "the ppa design adopted in this work uses a square pupil mask and the sum of two identical phase apodizations ( equation 6 in @xcite ) , one in the x - direction , the other in the y - direction .",
    "although the ppa mask has a 100% throughput within the square aperture , it exhibits large phase slopes at its edges , which are necessary to suppress diffraction in a quarter of the field but significantly increase the intensity of diffracted light in other parts of the field , reduce the amount of light in the central core of the psf and broaden the psf core . just as for binary amplitude apodization masks ,",
    "the ppa s large ratio between the pupil mask throughput ( here equal to  0.6 - area of the largest square that fits within the pupil ) and the light concentrated in the psf core ( @xmath30 ) is problematic in the presence of zodiacal and exozodiacal backgrounds .",
    "this coronagraph uses a lossless amplitude apodization of the pupil performed by geometric redistribution of the light rather than selective absorption @xcite .",
    "the same beam remapping technique is known as beam shaping in laser science @xcite and radio astronomy .",
    "the geometrical remapping of the telescope pupil amplifies phase slopes , therefore enabling observations at angular separations @xmath3 3 times smaller than with a conventional amplitude apodization .",
    "two designs are considered in this work :    * * piaa : * the detection occurs in the first focal plane after the beam remapping .",
    "starlight therefore falls on the detector but is concentrated in a single diffraction spot .",
    "this design is adopted for practical reasons in  [ sec : idealcase ] and  [ sec : stellarsize ] to avoid having to tune a focal plane mask diameter . * * piaac : * a focal plane mask occults starlight in the first focal plane .",
    "an inverse beam remapping unit then restores the original pupil to recover field of view .",
    "while a focal plane mask size needs to be chosen for this design , it is adopted in  [ sec : montecarlo ] to maintain a sharp planet image over the zodi and exozodi backgrounds .",
    "an interesting alternative to cpa techniques is phase induced zonal zernike apodization , pizza , @xcite , which achieves the pupil amplitude apodization without compromising the telescope s throughput or angular resolution .",
    "pizza , which is not simulated in this work , may be too chromatic to be practically suitable for imaging etps .",
    "the iwa delivered by pizza , cpa and ppa are similar .      in a lyot coronagraph , the telescope pupil and the focal plane mask",
    "are not perfectly fitted one for another , resulting in strong stellar leaks ( much higher than the @xmath26 goal ) within the coronagraph s lyot stop . for a lyot coronagraph to deliver high contrast performance ,",
    "the complex amplitude in the `` intermediate '' focal plane ( equal to the fourier transform of the entrance pupil multiplied by the focal plane occulter ) needs to be `` band - limited '' : its fourier transform ( @xmath31 complex amplitude in the lyot pupil plane ) should have nearly zero power in a frequency range which is then selectively transmitted by the lyot pupil stop .",
    "improved performance over the original lyot design can therefore be obtained by either :    * adapting the pupil to the hard edge focal plane mask .",
    "this is achieved in the apodized pupil lyot coronagraph , aplc , described in @xcite , where the entrance pupil of a lyot coronagraph with a hard edge focal plane occulter is optimally apodized . a slightly different approach , explored by @xcite ( see figure 3 of the paper ) ,",
    "is to apodize the pupil after the hard edge focal plane occulter . as suggested by @xcite , the output of an aplc can be used as the input of a second stage aplc : these are the multistep aplcs ( noted aplc@xmath13 , where @xmath12 is the number of steps ) . * adapting the focal plane mask to the telescope pupil .",
    "this is achieved by using `` band limited masks '' in the focal plane : the @xmath5 order band limited coronagraph , bl4",
    "@xcite and 8th order band limited coronagraph , bl8 @xcite . a visible nuller interferometer ( vnc ) equivalent to the bl4 coronagraph design adopted in this work could be designed , and we therefore refer to this bl4 design as vnc / bl4(2 ) .",
    "phase mask coronagraphs ( pm , 4qpm , ovc , odc ) introduce phase shifts in the focal plane .",
    "this allows smaller iwas than offered by aplcs and bls .",
    "* pm : the phase mask coronagraph @xcite uses a circular @xmath23-shifting focal plane mask , and , to allow @xmath1 contrast , a mild pupil amplitude apodization @xcite .",
    "* 4qpm : the 4-quadrant phase mask @xcite uses a focal plane mask which shifts 2 out of 4 quadrants of the image by @xmath23 .",
    "the achromatic phase knife coronagraph @xcite is another form of 4qpm .",
    "* ovc : in the optical vortex coronagraph @xcite and the angular groove phase mask coronagraph @xcite , a focal plane vortex phase mask replaces the 4 quadrant phase mask of the 4qpm , thus avoiding the `` dead zones '' of the 4qpm . in @xmath32 polar",
    "coordinates , the mask phase is equal to @xmath33 , where @xmath19 is the _",
    "topological charge_. ovcs with high topological charges ( @xmath34 ) exhibit low sensitivity to low - order aberrations .",
    "* odc : the optical differentiation coronagraph @xcite is using a phase and amplitude focal plane mask .",
    "some of the designs listed in table [ tab : coronagraphs ] may be combined in series .",
    "the multistep aplc concept @xcite illustrates how such a `` cascade '' can simultaneously improve iwa and throughput by designing each step for a lower contrast level .",
    "@xcite showed how a nulling interferometer can benefit from a cpa , and a similar combination may also be advantageous on a circular pupil ( vnc - cpa for example ) .",
    "the entrance pupil apodization required for the aplcs may be performed by a piaa unit to improve iwa and throughput .",
    "although combinations of coronagraphic techniques are not studied in this paper , the results obtained on individual designs can provide a good insight into which combinations may be most beneficial .    pupil replication",
    "@xcite has been proposed to transform a phase slope ( equivalent to angular separation on the sky ) into phase discontinuities in the replicated pupil . for the off - axis planet , this creates secondary diffraction peaks far from the central source image .",
    "the authors pointed out that it could enhance the performance of a coronagraph with which it would be combined .",
    "@xcite , in a sensitivity study of pupil replication , suggested to use it after a 4qpm .",
    "the tip - tilt sensitivity of both techniques ( pupil replication introduces phase steps in the wavefront of an off - axis source ; see  [ sec : ttsens ] for the 4qpm ) may be a concern for direct imaging of terrestrial planets .",
    "a coronagraphic effect can be obtained by placing an occulting screen , at least as big as the telescope diameter , between the star and the telescope @xcite .",
    "this external occulter needs to be designed to not diffract starlight within the telescope aperture , needs to be placed far from the telescope ( on a separate spacecraft ) , and the telescope - occulter - star alignment needs to be maintained during observations .",
    "while maintaining the alignment is especially challenging , a `` conventional '' imaging telescope can be used without the need for exquisite control of wavefront aberrations .",
    "since we aim at quantitatively comparing the performance of coronagraph designs , we need a ",
    "fair  performance metric : one that can be applied uniformly to all coronagraph designs .",
    "coronagraph performance is usually quantified with inner working angle ( usually defined as the minimal angular distance at which the throughput for the planet is half of the maximal throughput ) , throughput ( measured at large angular separation ) , and search area ( fraction of the focal plane image within which a planet can be detected ) .",
    "the iwa is somewhat arbitrary , as there is no well - defined stellar - to - companion light ratio threshold beyond which companion light suddenly becomes unmeasurable .",
    "iwa is coupled with throughput : for example , a coronagraph with a 10% maximum throughput achieving 5% throughput at 1 @xmath4 has a smaller iwa than a coronagraph with a 100% maximum throughput achieving 30 % throughput at 1 @xmath4 . in this example",
    ", the larger iwa coronagraph outperforms the smaller iwa coronagraph .",
    "search area is also somewhat arbitrary and often can not be quantified as a single number .",
    "for example , diffraction from 4 spider vanes in 2 perpendicular directions ( we assume here that the width of the diffraction spikes created by the spiders is equal to the iwa of the coronagraph ) covers @xmath35 of the field of view at the iwa and @xmath36 at large angular separations . * metrics commonly used to quantify coronagraph performances ( iwa , throughput and search area ) are therefore difficult to use to directly compare coronagraph designs . *    a simpler , more direct measure of how well a coronagraph can separate planet light from star light , the `` useful throughput '' ,",
    "is proposed here .",
    "it is defined as the amount of planet light which can be used toward detection , and is expressed as a function of the planet position relative to the star and the planet / star contrast .",
    "when averaged over all position angles , it conveniently quantifies the coronagraph performance with a single number ( making it possible to directly compare coronagraph performances ) , function of the angular separation .",
    "this function accurately includes the effects of iwa , throughput and search area , and is a good estimation of the coronagraph performance .    to compute this quantity ,",
    "we must first define when planet light in the coronagraph detector plane becomes `` unusable '' because of excessive starlight mixed with it .",
    "theoretically , direct detection of companions embedded in much brighter starlight is possible if the starlight component on the image is well characterized .",
    "practically , due to calibration problems and photon noise ( exoplanets are faint ) , companion light mixed with much brighter starlight is unusable .",
    "there is however no well - defined stellar - to - companion light ratio threshold beyond which companion light becomes unmeasurable : the criteria we will use to define the ",
    "useful throughput  ( hereafter denoted throughput ) is therefore somewhat arbitrary .",
    "graphical representation of the useful throughput . in this 1-d example , the stellar and planet psf are shown with some overlapping .",
    "the useful throughput is obtained by integrating the companion ( planet ) light from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ; in this interval , the integrated flux contributions from the central source and the companion are equal . ]",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : usablet ] , the `` useful throughput '' is the maximum fraction of the planet s light gathered by the telescope which can be separated from starlight .",
    "the `` separation '' criteria used is that , integrated over the area of the focal plane considered , there is as much planet light as there is residual stellar light .",
    "physically , this area may be a single pixel or a group of pixels on a focal plane array detector .    to compute the useful throughput of a coronagraph at a particular location in the image plane , we first model the images @xmath39 and @xmath40 produced respectively by a star and a much fainter planet in the coronagraph .",
    "pixels are then sorted in decreasing order of @xmath41 ; for the first pixels in this sorted list , a large fraction of the light collected originates from the planet while the last pixels of this list are dominated by starlight .",
    "the number @xmath42 is chosen such that , over the first @xmath42 pixels of this list , the total starlight collected is equal to the total planet light collected .",
    "this total amount of planet light , divided by the the flux in planet light that is collected by the entrance aperture , is the * useful throughput*. we note that if , on every pixel of the image , starlight exceeds planet light , then the useful throughput will be zero .",
    "figure [ fig : usefult ] shows the useful throughput for the coronagraphs listed in table [ tab : coronagraphs ] . for small angular separations ( @xmath43 ) the aic is the most efficient coronagraph , with a 50% useful throughput at @xmath44 . based on our assumptions , the phase mask coronagraphs ( especially ovc@xmath45 , pm and 4qpm ) and piaa are the best choices from @xmath44 outward .",
    "many coronagraphs in this list never achieve a very high throughput because of strong entrance pupil apodization ( cpa , aplc , and to a lesser degree aplc@xmath13 ) , beam splitting ( psc , vnc ) , or pupil diaphragming ( vnc / bl4 , bl8 ) .",
    "the range of performance is very large : the aic offers an iwa about 8 times smaller than the cpa , and the piaa s throughput is about 10 times the cpa s throughput beyond @xmath46 .",
    "many of the coronagraph designs studied in this paper were developed in the last few years , and there is therefore hope that a large number of other coronagraph designs will be discovered in the near future .",
    "it is particularly interesting to wonder how much of the upper left area of figure [ fig : usefult ] ( high throughput at small angular distance ) can / will be accessed . in the following section ,",
    "we derive a fundamental limit of coronagraph throughput ( shown in figure [ fig : usefult ] ) using a  universal ",
    "model of coronagraphs .",
    "we consider an optical system , shown in figure [ fig : matrixu ] , in which light enters through a pupil ( which may or may not be circular ) which we represent by a finite ( but large ) number @xmath12 of regularly spaced elements .",
    "similarly , the output of this optical system , defined by the points at which light is detected , blocked or exits the system , is represented by @xmath12 points . to a coherent light source ( such as a point source at infinity ) corresponds a distribution of complex amplitude at the pupil of this system , written here as a vector @xmath47 of @xmath12 complex numbers .",
    "although @xmath47 is written as a vector , it represents a 2d distribution of complex amplitude across the pupil : each of its coefficient is the complex amplitude of the incident wave across one of the @xmath12 elements in the entrance pupil .",
    "we note that this description is only valid to the extent that complex amplitude is constant across each pupil element - this limitation is equivalent to a field of view limit in the focal plane , and our model is therefore not suitable for point sources at more than @xmath48 from the optical axis . for convenience ,",
    "we choose to normalize this vector such that the total light intensity in the pupil is unity ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "optical systems are ( usually ) linear in complex amplitude : the complex amplitude anywhere in the system can be written as a linear combination of complex amplitudes in the entrance pupil .",
    "for example , fourier transforms and fresnel propagation simulations are linear operations commonly performed to compute coronagraphic images .",
    "the output complex amplitude vector @xmath50 can therefore be written as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a nxn complex matrix which entirely describes the optical system and @xmath53 is the point source position in the sky .",
    "the output vector @xmath50 includes light that is blocked by masks ( turned into heat ) , exits the system ( for example , reflected back to the sky ) or falls on the detector ( these are the only coronagraph outputs that can be measured and therefore used for planet detection ) .",
    "conservation of energy in the system imposes @xmath54 : @xmath52 is therefore a * complex unitary matrix , function of the coronagraph optics , but independent of the entrance wavefront * ( and therefore independent of the source position @xmath53 in the sky ) .",
    "wavefront control elements , if present , are also part of @xmath52 .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : matrixu ] , in a coronagraph , the goal is to create system output(s ) for which an on - axis source will produce very little light , but a closeby off - axis source s flux will be transmitted .",
    "mathematically speaking , a matrix @xmath52 needs to be chosen such that some coefficients of @xmath55 ( we denote @xmath56 the number of such coefficients ) are very small for @xmath57 , but relatively high for other values of @xmath53 . to",
    "this set of coefficients corresponds a sub - space @xmath58 of dimension @xmath42 ( shown as the bottom part of vector @xmath50 on figure [ fig : matrixu ] ) .",
    "the coronagraph optimization problem can be further restricted by fixing a 2d vector @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the planet off - axis position at which the coronagraph s throughput is to be maximized . in this case , a change of coordinate system ( rotation ) within the sub - space @xmath58 can concentrate all the planet flux within @xmath58 on a single coefficient .",
    "this change of coordinate system is a function of @xmath60 , and aligns , within @xmath58 , the 2d vector @xmath59 with one of the directions of the new coordinate system .",
    "physically this is equivalent to placing multiple beam splitters and phase shifters to concentrate all of the planet light within @xmath58 in a single output beam : this would be possible thanks to the fact that planet light is fully coherent .",
    "this norm - preserving coordinate change is itself a unitary matrix which can be integrated within @xmath52 ( by direct multiplication with the `` old '' @xmath52 ) , in which case only a single column of this new @xmath52 matrix is now relevant to the problem : we denote @xmath61 this column ( @xmath61 is a vector ) . since @xmath52 is unitary , @xmath62 . in this new basis",
    ", @xmath63 is the square absolute value of one of the coefficients of the new vector @xmath50 and is equal to the coronagraph throughput at the sky position @xmath53 : it is therefore the quantity to be minimized for @xmath64 and maximized for @xmath65 .",
    "we use in this section the new base described at the end of the previous section , where the sub - space @xmath58 corresponds to a single coefficient of @xmath50 . in this `` optimized coronagraphic projection '' , the energy in this single coefficient is the useful throughput of the coronagraph , as long as , within this single `` pixel '' , the stellar flux is smaller than the planet flux . excluding all other coefficients of @xmath50",
    ", we can now equivalently refer to the coronagraph throughput or useful throughput .",
    "we denote @xmath66 the on - axis coronagraph throughput ( no more than @xmath26 for a system designed to image etps in the visible ) and @xmath67 the input complex amplitude for an on - axis source .",
    "we note that @xmath66 is a throughput , not a contrast , and should therefore ideally be no more than @xmath26 times the coronagraph throughput for the planet .",
    "it is now possible to design an ideal theoretical coronagraph for detecting a source at the position @xmath60 by choosing a complex vector @xmath61 of norm 1 such that :    1 .",

    "a glance at figure [ fig : projection ] reveals that if @xmath59 and @xmath67 are close ( ie .",

    "the `` transmitted '' wavefront is therefore dominated by a combination of modes m1 and m2 .",

    "we can therefore predict that along any direction , its psf is a fixed image multiplied by the 6@xmath128 power of source angular separation , and that psfs for 2 point sources on opposite sides of the optical axis will be identical .",
    "a similar behavior is seen in figure [ fig : psfs_smallangle ] for the ovc@xmath118 , which also removes the first 6 modes shown in figure [ fig : modes ] .",
    "since this coronagraph also attenuates further modes , the psf structures and throughput are however different from the icc@xmath118 , which is designed to perfectly cancel the first 6 modes and fully transmit the others .",
    "active elements ( deformable mirrors ) can be used to create a coherent `` anti speckle halo '' which destructively interferes with the unwanted residual focal plane speckles .",
    "these speckle nulling techniques , first proposed by @xcite , were more recently studied by several authors @xcite and successfully tested in laboratory @xcite .",
    "the star can be modeled as a set of point sources uniformly distributed on the stellar disk ( these sources are not mutually coherent ) .",
    "we first assume that a second order coronagraph is used , and we consider only one of these point sources ( not at the center of the disk ) which contributes to the coronagraphic leakage by adding an image on the focal plane .",
    "this particular image is fully coherent and can therefore be canceled by a speckle nulling technique .",
    "the shape / state of the active optical element(s ) ( dm for example ) in the speckle control device will be such that the phase and amplitude of the `` anti speckle halo '' is the opposite ( same amplitude , @xmath23 phase offset ) of the leakage : destructive interference between the 2 will leave no light in the focal plane .",
    "we now decide to `` freeze '' the state of the speckle nulling device and move the point source on the other side of the optical axis .",
    "this multiplies the complex amplitude of the coronagraphic leakage by @xmath135 (  [ sssec:2ndorderc ] ) but does not change the `` anti speckle halo '' ( which is independent of source position within the small angular displacement considered ) .",
    "the leakage and `` anti speckle halo '' will therefore add rather than subtract because of a phase mismatch , and the leakage intensity will be 4 times higher than without speckle nulling . to every point on",
    "the stellar disk corresponds an equally bright point on the other side of the optical axis : speckle nulling can not reduce coronagraphic leaks in a second - order coronagraph .",
    "the same `` phase mismatch '' argument applies to @xmath136 order coronagraph such as @xmath137 .",
    "independently of this `` phase mismatch '' effect ( which would not apply to a @xmath5 order coronagraph dominated by modes m3 to m5 ) , coronagraphic leaks increase as the point on the stellar disk moves away from the optical axis , and there is therefore a similar `` amplitude mismatch '' effect when stellar points at different radii are considered .",
    "the stellar angular size problem described in  [ sec : ttsens ] truly is a fundamental limit .      pointing errors ( or any higher order optics aberrations ) , on the other hand ,",
    "produce a coherent leak which can be suppressed by wavefront control techniques .",
    "low order aberrations can be measured from the coronagraphic leaks they produce .",
    "a more optimal strategy is to `` catch '' aberrations before they start to increase coronagraphic leaks by utilizing `` for free '' the large amount light that is blocked by the coronagraph .",
    "this can usually be done by re - imaging of the light reflected by the focal plane occulter ( or , for phase mask coronagraphs , the light outside the geometric pupil ) .",
    "we note that speckle sensing and nulling usually require a small spectral bandwidth , as the speckle coherence is low in white light : the observing spectral band may have to be split with dichroics in small `` bins '' prior to applying speckle nulling .",
    "the `` useful throughput '' introduced in  [ sec : usefult ] accurately quantifies the coronagraphic performance in a system composed solely of a star and a single planet .",
    "a planetary system is however observed against incoherent zodiacal and exozodiacal light backgrounds . for simplicity , we assume here that both background components are constant across the field ( this is an approximation for the exozodiacal light ) and that they can be numerically subtracted to the photon noise level .",
    "we consider a planet+background system ( no central star ) in which @xmath138 is the ratio between total planet light and total background light within the planet image ( which we define here , for convenience , as the smallest focal plane area containing half of the planet s psf light )",
    ". we denote @xmath139 this value for a non - coronagraphic imaging telescope ( airy pattern ) .",
    "coronagraphs unfortunately tend to decrease @xmath138 ( @xmath140 ) by a factor which we denote the * diffractive efficiency factor ( def ) * :    * pupil amplitude apodization and/or clipping in the lyot plane increases the angular size of the planet image , therefore mixing more background light with the planet light . *",
    "the aic delivers double images of the planet , therefore dividing @xmath138 by two .",
    "* coronagraphs delivering psfs in which a significant fraction of the light is outside the main diffraction core decrease @xmath138 .",

    "an identical scheme is used in the piaac design , although this coronagraph falls short of the theoretically ideal performance derived in this work . the piaac first concentrates stellar light in a very tight diffraction core ( step 1 ) , which is then blocked by a mask ( step 2 ) .",

    "a second remapping unit is therefore then used to undo the first remapping ( step 3 ) .",

    "since the only currently known solution to build the ideal coronagraph requires many beam splitters , this type of coronagraph is referred to as the interferometric combination coronagraph ( icc@xmath13 , where @xmath12 is the number of modes removed in the coronagraphic intermediate step ) in this work .",

    "table [ tab : coronagraphs_eval ] concludes the previous sections by listing the main characteristics of the coronagraphs studied in this paper .",
    "in the previous sections , coronagraph performance has been quantified by the * useful throughput * and the * diffractive efficiency factor*. together , these two quantities could be used to evaluate , for a given target ( star+planet+background ) , the signal - to - noise ( snr ) as a function of exposure time .",
    "this simple model can unfortunately be quite inaccurate :    * exozodiacal light is not a smooth background ( it is significantly brighter closer to the star and in a high inclination system , the exozodi disk can be a narrow linear feature ) : its effect can not be accurately modeled by the diffractive efficiency factor .",
    "planets are brighter when in nearly full phase , but are then closer to the star and therefore over brighter portions of the exozodi cloud .",
    "* in the presence of background light ( zodiacal + exozodiacal light ) , faint parts of the psfs that contribute to the useful throughput can have a negligible contribution to the detection snr : the spatial distribution of the planet light affects the snr .",
    "while the useful throughput and the def provided us with valuable insight into coronagraph performances , accurate estimation of the detection sensitivity requires explicit computation of images delivered by the coronagraph .    in this section , the performance of six promising coronagraphs identified in the previous sections ( cpa , piaac , bl8 , ovc6 , icc6 and vnc / bl4(2 ) )",

    "for an 8 m telescope observing in the 0.50.6 @xmath173 m band , this final sample contains 3429 stars at an average distance of 51 pc .",
    "zodiacal light is modeled as a uniform background across the telescope s field of view . for each target , it is assumed that the observation occurs at the time of the year when the zodiacal background is minimal , which is about 40 days before or after opposition for most targets .",
    "the resulting zodiacal background , derived from @xcite , is a function of ecliptic latitude , and ranges from @xmath180 23.28 ( ecliptic poles ) to @xmath180 22.24 ( ecliptic equator ) .",

    "the psf is computed for each point , and the final image delivered by the telescope / coronagraph is obtained by adding the  30000 coronagraphic psfs together .      the exozodiacal cloud is assumed to be a thin disk with dust optical depth , as seen from above the 2d disk , varying as @xmath181 ( surface brightness @xmath182 ) .",
    "this power law index is derived from modeling of our own zodiacal cloud in the earth neighborhood @xcite . for a 1 zodi exozodiacal disk , the dust optical depth at the location of the planet",
    "is chosen to be identical to the vertical optical depth of our zodiacal cloud at 1 au . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath183 m surface brightness of a face - on exozodi cloud at the location of the planet is thus a function of the ratio between the star bolometric luminosity ( which defines where the planet is ) and the star luminosity at @xmath183 m ( which defines how much the star illuminates the dust ) .",
    "the inner edge of the exozodi cloud is set at 0.02 au times the square root of the star s bolometric luminosity ( dust sublimation ) , and its outer edge is 5 times the planet - star distance .",
    "the image of the exozodiacal cloud delivered by the telescope / coronagraph is computed with the same 0.2 @xmath4 sampling as used for the zodiacal background image .",
    "it is assumed that the stellar diameter , exozodi cloud , zodiacal background and telescope / coronagraph characteristics are perfectly known .",
    "the planet detection snr is therefore driven by photon noise and is proportional to the square root of the exposure time . the photon noise ( from the planet , star , zodiacal and exozodiacal images ) and the signal ( the planet image )",
    "are evaluated for each pixel of the image .",
    "the planet * detection snr * is obtained by the quadratic sum of the pixel snrs : this optimal weighting scheme favors pixels with large planet flux and low zodi+exozodi+star flux .",
    "we assume here that at the time of the observation , the position of the planet along its orbit is unknown . for a given exposure time ,",
    "the planet detection snr is computed at each point along the planet orbit . a limit on the snr",
    "is adopted ( snr @xmath184 7 ) for successful detection , and the number of points along the planet orbit for which this limit is reached yields the * planet detection probability*. this probability , also referred to as completeness @xcite , is therefore a function of exposure time .",
    "a related metric used in this study , derived from the planet detection probability , is the single - exposure integration time required to reach a given planet detection probability .",
    "figure [ fig : exampleimages ] shows some example frames obtained by the simulation code for the 6 coronagraphs selected .",
    "these images nicely illustrate coronagraphic characteristics quantified in the previous section :    * * useful throughput at large separation . *",
    "the cpa , bl8 , and to a lesser extent vnc / bl4(2 ) suffer from low coronagraphic throughput . as a result ,",
    "the planet s image , even if well outside the coronagraph mask s influence , appears noisy ( few photons detected ) .",
    "the piaac , ovc6 and icc6 , on the other hand , enjoy nearly 100% throughput : the planet image is brighter and less noisy . * * angular resolution . *",
    "the cpa , bl8 , and to a lesser extent vnc / bl4(2 ) have poorer angular resolution : the planet image is larger and more zodi / exozodi light is mixed with it .",
    "* * ability to work at small angular separation .",
    "* none of the coronagraph tested can detect the planet on a 2 m telescope with the exposure time , wavelength , and throughput used in figure [ fig : exampleimages ] .",
    "detection appears feasible on a 4 m telescope with the vnc / bl4(2 ) , piaac , ovc6 and icc6 , but requires a 6 m telescope with the bl8 .",
    "finally , an 8 m telescope is needed for detection with a cpa .",
    "* * sensitivity to stellar angular size .",
    "* the cpa and bl8 are extremely robust to stellar angular size : starlight leaks are virtually nonexistent even on the 12 m telescope . with the vnc / bl4(2 ) , piaac , ovc6 and icc6 , starlight is visible on the 12 m telescope ( equivalent to a 6 m telescope observing the same system at 5pc ) , although it is still fainter that the exozodiacal contribution .",
    "images similar to the ones shown in figure [ fig : exampleimages ] can be generated for each possible position of the planet along its orbit .",

    "results are shown in figure [ fig : idealcaseetime ] for 4 m and 8 m telescopes .        in a purely background - limited detection , exposure time",
    "is expected to scale linearly with the background level : approximately 7 times longer for the 10 zodi exozodi case than for the 1 zodi exozodi case ( assuming the local zodi background corresponds to half a zodi of exozodiacal light ) .",
    "the fact that this is generally true in figure [ fig : idealcaseetime ] confirms the importance of the def in coronagraph designs . for coronagraphs with low defs , such as piaac , ovc6 and icc6 , increasing the exozodi however results in moderate increase of exposure time for nearby targets ( non background - limited detections ) .",
    "this effect is most clearly visible in the 8 m telescope case for the easiest targets .",
    "figure [ fig : idealcaseetime ] compares how many targets fall below the 1hr , 10hr and 1 day required exposure time levels with different exozodi contents . with the 4 m telescope ,",
    "the cpa and bl8 can not access the `` habitable zone '' of targets beyond @xmath185 , resulting in a very small number of potential targets ( 8 and 16 targets respectively for cpa and bl8 if `` potential target '' is defined as one that requires less than 10hr exposure time to reach the 50% detection probability ) .",
    "the vnc / bl4(2 ) , thanks to its higher throughput , can access 34 targets . with this telescope diameter ( 4 m ) , the stellar angular size is sufficiently small to allow improved performance over cpa and bl8 , which are more robust to stellar angular size . in increasing order of performance , the ovc6 , piaac and icc6 offer from 87 to 177 targets in the 1-zodi case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the performance of the ovc6 and piaac is very similar , while the `` ideal '' icc6 offers almost twice as many targets as the piaac .",
    "this is mostly due to the benefit of smaller iwa in the icc6 over the piaac : @xmath186 vs. @xmath187 , which increases the iwa - accessible volume by 2.9 .",
    "the planet intrinsic brightness and the background level prevent access to distant systems , and there is therefore little gain in reducing the iwa below @xmath187 .    with any of the 3 `` top '' coronagraph designs simulated in this work ( piaac , ovc6 and icc6 ) ,",
    "a 4 m telescope could , with a 10hr per observation limit and a 1-zodi assumption on the exozodi , perform a @xmath188 target survey for etps . the total exposure time to complete this survey , assuming 6 observations of 10hr for each target , would be well under a year , and therefore sounds realistically achievable . under the same assumptions , strong exozodi ( 10 zodi )",
    "would cut in half the sample size .",
    "figure [ fig : idealcaseetime ] shows that doubling the telescope diameter ( from 4 m to 8 m ) multiplies the number of accessible targets by about 8 for all exozodi content , coronagraph type and exposure time limit combinations tested .",
    "the relative efficiencies of the 6 coronagraphs tested stay the same , with , in order of decreasing performance , the icc6 , piaac and ovc6 able to access several hundred targets in the 1-zodi case ( with a 1hr exposure time limit criteria ) , the vnc / bl4(2 ) about 50 targets and the bl8 and cpa a few tens of targets .    in this study",
    ", we have used an earth - analog as a prototype for earth - like planets .",
    "the broad concept of candidate earth - like ( potentially habitable ) planets likely extends to include planet diameters to several times smaller and larger than earth .",
    "orienting a survey to optimize detection for a different planet radius would of course change the observation times for each system and the number of systems which could be surveyed .",
    "similarly , an observing program can be optimized for any target list and planet description to maximize the productivity with respect to total detections or other criterion .",
    "we have quantified the performance limit imposed by fundamental physics on the direct imaging of etps . a solution to build an `` optimal '' coronagraph reaching this limit",
    "was proposed , but may be technologically difficult to implement .",
    "fortunately , we have also demonstrated that two existing coronagraph designs ( piaac and ovc6 ) yield performances reasonably close ( within a factor 2 in number of accessible targets ) to this fundamental limit .",
    "these recently proposed designs could image etps around up to about 100 stars with a 4 m telescope , or several hundred stars with an 8 m telescope .      * * wavefront control at the sub - @xmath189level*. thanks to the large number of stellar photons available , recent detector developments , and the expectation that a space telescope can be designed to offer a relatively stable wavefront ( with little rapidly varying aberrations , as opposed to atmospheric turbulence for ground - based telescopes ) , it may be reasonable to hope for this level of correction .",
    "several authors have recently explored promising wavefront control schemes free of aliasing and non - common path aberrations @xcite , and contrast levels obtained in laboratory @xcite are approaching the desired performance . * * chromatic effects * can seriously limit the coronagraph s usable spectral band .",
    "a large number of solutions have been proposed to `` achromatize '' coronagraphs , many of them specific to a single coronagraph design @xcite .",
    "in addition to coronagraph - induced chromatic effects , the beam delivered by the telescope is expected to be chromatic in amplitude and optical pathlength differences ( non - ideal coatings , chromatic diffraction propagation between optics ) . in general ,",
    "chromatic effects can be mitigated by reducing chromaticity in individual components ( beam splitters , phase - shifters , apodization masks ) or / and by splitting the spectral band into several narrower bands with dichroics .",
    "more fundamentally , the assumption that detection is photon noise limited seems highly optimistic : etps are embedded in an exozodiacal light unlikely to be perfectly smooth and symmetrical . since good angular resolution may help to distinguish between a planet and exozodiacal light features ( such as arcs or rings ) , it is important to avoid using coronagraphs that clip or strongly attenuate the edge of the telescope pupil if at all possible .",
    "the results obtained in this work should therefore be cautiously considered as upper limits on what may be achieved with a particular coronagraph / space telescope design for the specific goal of imaging etps around nearby stars .",
    "we also note that several low throughput / large iwa coronagraphs studied in this paper can be more favorably designed for ground - based applications , where contrast requirements are relaxed by about 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "the linear algebra approach to coronagraphy presented in this work successfully explains key characteristics and fundamental limits of coronagraphy . while we have focused our study on the fundamental limitations of coronagraphy ( due to stellar angular size and background contamination ) , this model can be extended to evaluate the sensitivity of coronagraphs to wavefront aberrations other than tip - tilt .",
    "the same model can also be used to derive fundamental limits and guide the design of coronagraphs for more `` exotic '' pupil shapes , from segmented pupils telescopes to short or long baseline interferometric arrays .",

    "<S> many high contrast coronagraph designs have recently been proposed . in this paper , their suitability for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets is reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a linear - algebra based model of coronagraphy that can both explain the behavior of existing coronagraphs and quantify the coronagraphic performance limit imposed by fundamental physics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the maximum theoretical throughput of a coronagraph is equal to one minus the non - aberrated non - coronagraphic psf of the telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we describe how a coronagraph reaching this fundamental limit may be designed , and how much improvement over the best existing coronagraph design is still possible . </S>",
    "<S> both the analytical model and numerical simulations of existing designs also show that this theoretical limit rapidly degrades as the source size is increased : the `` highest performance '' coronagraphs , those with the highest throughput and smallest inner working angle ( iwa ) , are the most sensitive to stellar angular diameter . </S>",
    "<S> this unfortunately rules out the possibility of using a small iwa ( @xmath0 ) coronagraph for a terrestrial planet imaging mission .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , a detailed numerical simulation which accurately accounts for stellar angular size , zodiacal and exozodiacal light is used to quantify the efficiency of coronagraph designs for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets in a possible real observing program . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the photon noise limited regime , a 4 m telescope with a theoretically optimal coronagraph is able to detect earth - like planets around 50 stars with 1hr exposure time per target ( assuming 25% throughput and exozodi levels similar to our solar system ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that at least 2 existing coronagraph design can approach this level of performance in the ideal monochromatic case considered in this study . </S>"
