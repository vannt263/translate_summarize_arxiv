    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the most plausible candidate of the origin of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) mainly composed of protons , electrons and nuclei .",
    "in fact , x - ray and @xmath0-ray observations showed that electrons and protons ( or nuclei ) are accelerated in snrs @xcite . the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite is the most plausible acceleration mechanism of gcrs , where it is assumed that accelerated particles diffusively move around a shock .",
    "it predicts a power - law momentum spectrum of the accelerated particles , that is almost consistent with radio observations of snrs @xcite",
    ". another important prediction of the dsa is a cr precursor ahead of the shock front .",
    "furthermore , linear analysis and several numerical simulations show that the cr precursor generates magnetic - field fluctuation @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the upstream plasma of the snr cygnus loop is abruptly heated in the vicinity of shocks and it can be explained by heating via damping of magnetic - field fluctuation in an unresolved thin cr precursor .",
    "however , the cr precursor of snrs has never been directly imaged so far .",
    "the length scale of the cr precursor tells us the diffusion coefficient of crs in the upstream region , that includes information about magnetic - field fluctuation generated by crs .",
    "the imaging observation of the cr precursor is crucial for identifying that dsa actually works at snr shocks , thus it is eagerly anticipated .",
    "the snr rx j1713.7@xmath13946 is one of the best studied snrs to understand cr acceleration ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) , that has been observed in radio , x - ray , and gev - tev @xmath0-ray bands . in particular , the origin of @xmath0-rays from rx j1713.7@xmath13946 has attracted attention over the years .",
    "one is the hadronic origin , that is , the @xmath0-rays originate from accelerated protons @xcite .",
    "the other is the leptonic origin in which the @xmath0-rays are generated by inverse compton emission from accelerated electrons @xcite . at present",
    ", the origin of @xmath0-rays from rx j1713.7@xmath13946 is an open problem .",
    "recently , some new data about rx j1713.7@xmath13946 were reported .",
    "@xcite reported the first detection of thermal x - ray line emission from rx j1713.7@xmath13946 and proposed that rx j1713.7@xmath13946 was a remnant of an sn ib / c .",
    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) reported two interesting results",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "the new gev - tev @xmath0-ray spectrum breaks at about @xmath2 .",
    "the radial profile of @xmath0-rays is more extended than that of x - rays .",
    "the former has already suggested by @xcite although the spectrum of gev @xmath0-rays had a large uncertainty . in a simple leptonic model ,",
    "the recently observed @xmath0-ray spectrum tells us the existence of a break at a few tev in the spectrum of accelerated electrons .",
    "however , it is hardly explained by the cooling break because it requires a strong magnetic field or a very high photon field energy density , that conflict with other observations . moreover , a one - zone leptonic model can not explain the extended @xmath0-ray profile .",
    "therefore , a simple leptonic model seems to be confronted by the severe challenge @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that if the maximum energy of accelerated electrons is decreasing with time and it is now about a few tev , the time - integrated spectrum of accelerated electrons breaks at a few tev , that can explain the new gev - tev gamma ray spectrum by inverse compton emission . in addition , our model can naturally explain the @xmath0-ray profile by the cr precursor of currently accelerated electrons with energy of a few tev .",
    "hence , the leptonic model is still plausible and the extended component of @xmath0-ray image is the first observation of the cr precursor of snrs .",
    "@xcite showed that if the maximum energy of accelerated particles at the shock decreases with time , @xmath3 , and the number of accelerated particles at the shock increases with time , @xmath4 ( we assumed that the standard test particle dsa ) , then the time integrated spectrum of all accelerated particles becomes a broken power law as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the maximum energy of accelerated particles in a whole system .",
    "schematic picture of the time integrated spectrum is given by figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energy spectrum of accelerated particles inside an snr breaks even though the radiative cooling is not significant . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a model that makes @xmath7 and @xmath8 a few tev at present , and the observed gev - tev @xmath0-ray spectrum can be explained by inverse compton emission .",
    "it was considered in @xcite and @xcite that particles above @xmath9 escape from an snr . in this paper",
    ", we assume that all particles above @xmath9 are advected into the downstream region of snrs .",
    "particles escape from the snr if @xmath10 is limited by escape , while they are advected into the snr interior if @xmath10 is limited by a finite age of the snr .",
    "more details are discussed in the next section .",
    "in our model .",
    "the red and blue lines show the age and cooling limited maximum energies , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the snr age at present .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ]    3946 .",
    "the black solid and dashed curves show model spectra without ( @xmath12 ) and with cooling ( @xmath13 ) in the downstream region of snr shocks , respectively .",
    "the red , green , blue , and magenta data points are given by _",
    "@xcite , atca @xcite , _ fermi _",
    "@xcite , and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , respectively . [ fig:2 ] ]    before discussing the evolution of @xmath10 of accelerated electrons , we first set a simple model of snr rx j1713.7@xmath13946 .",
    "the snr is thought to be associated with the guest star ad393 @xcite .",
    "if so , the present age of the snr is about @xmath14 .",
    "according to the x - ray image @xcite , the angular radius of snr shock is now about @xmath15 that corresponds to the shock radius @xmath16 if the distance is about @xmath17 @xcite . for simplicity , we here assume that the snr is now in the free expansion phase , that is , the shock velocity is constant with time , @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we assume a constant density profile . then , @xmath19 is 3 because the swept - up mass is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "evolution of @xmath10 of accelerated electrons in snrs was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 of electrons being accelerated is decided by a finite age , escape , or cooling . during the free expansion phase , the @xmath10 does not decrease with time as long as the diffusion coefficient is spatially constant ( see figures 1 and 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we here assume that the diffusion coefficient around the shock front has a radial dependence , @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents radial dependence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "rx j1713.7@xmath13946 is thought to be expanding into a cavity produced by a stellar wind and the snr radius is now very close to the cavity wall @xcite .",
    "we expect that the outer region of the cavity has large diffusion coefficient compared with the interior , because there are many neutral hydrogen atoms and molecules in the outside region .",
    "the diffusion coefficient increases toward the cavity wall in the transition region . in order to describe such a situation , we set @xmath22 to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a transition radius and @xmath25 .",
    "since the acceleration time scale is given by @xmath26 , from the condition , @xmath27 , the age - limited maximum energy is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the maximum energy of currently accelerated particles and given by @xmath31 a numerical factor @xmath32 depends on the shock compression ratio and the diffusion coefficient in the downstream region @xcite .",
    "since @xmath33 is expected to be positive , the maximum energy decreases with time for @xmath34 if @xmath35 is larger than unity , and @xmath36 becomes @xmath37 the escape - limited maximum energy is given by the condition , @xmath38 , where the escape time scale is @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a numerical factor .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath41 since @xmath42 is of the order of unity , evolution of the escape - limited maximum energy is almost the same as the age - limited maximum energy . in this paper",
    ", we assume @xmath43 , so that the escape does not limit the maximum energy and all particles accelerated in the past are trapped in the downstream region of snr shocks .    the synchrotron cooling time is represented by @xmath44 and the condition @xmath45 gives the cooling - limited maximum energy as @xmath46 where we assume a constant magnetic field in the downstream region because the shock velocity is constant in the free expansion phase .",
    "the cooling - limited maximum energy at the present day , @xmath47 , is given by @xmath48    then , the evolution of the @xmath10 of electrons being accelerated at time t , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 in order to explain the new gev - tev @xmath0-ray spectrum , we need @xmath51 a few tev , and the maximum energy at @xmath52 is about 100 tev .    in this paper , we set @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , so that we obtain @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath7 .",
    "these parameters are representative but not unique and other parameter sets would be allowed to explain the observed data .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the evolution of the @xmath10 of particles being accelerated .",
    "the red and blue lines shows the age and cooling limited maximum energies , respectively , where we assume @xmath57 that is obtained by a spectral fitting of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectra based on the leptonic model @xcite . in our model , the maximum energy is always limited by a finite age .",
    "it should be noted that the cooling is negligible while electrons are being accelerated , but after advected into the downstream region , high - energy electrons lose their energy by the synchrotron cooling .",
    "let @xmath58 to be the end time of the acceleration of electrons with an energy @xmath59 . then , from the condition @xmath60 , we can obtain a new cutoff energy by cooling , @xmath61 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "advected electrons lose their energy in the downstream region .",
    "however , some electrons with an energy @xmath59 are in cr precursor region at @xmath63 and it takes a little time to enter the shock downstream region .",
    "therefore , their residence time in the downstream region becomes smaller than @xmath64 . in this case , we need to solve numerically the diffusion convection equation taking into account the cooling for the purpose of precisely having @xmath65 . in this paper , instead of solving the equation , we simply consider two cases , @xmath66 and @xmath67 tev .",
    "we calculate synchrotron and inverse compton emissions by using the galactic radiation field of @xmath68 model of @xcite , where the klein ",
    "nishina effect is taken into account .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the synchrotron and inverse compton spectra from accelerated electrons .",
    "the dashed and solid black curves show spectra with and without cooling in the downstream region of the snr shock , that is , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "both curves are almost consistent with the observed spectrum",
    ". a more realistic spectrum would be between the solid and dashed curves .",
    "hence , our leptonic model can explain x - ray and gev - tev @xmath0-ray spectra without the cooling break .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the shock position expected from the x - ray image @xcite .",
    "the black and blue solid curves show model profiles of @xmath0-rays and x - rays .",
    "the black and blue dashed curves show another model profiles of @xmath0-rays and x - rays , where the step function in equation ( [ eq : nd ] ) is removed .",
    "the red data points and solid curve show the observed profile of @xmath0-rays and x - rays , that are given by @xcite .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ]    in this section , we calculate the radial profile of @xmath0-rays .",
    "the dsa predicts that currently accelerated electrons make the cr precursor .",
    "the diffusion equation in the upstream region of an snr shock is given by @xmath71 since the snr shock of rx j1713.7@xmath13946 is now very close to the cavity wall , we assume that the diffusion coefficient is spatially constant in the upstream region ( @xmath72 , see equation  ( [ eq : d ] ) ) .",
    "then , the solution for the steady - state limit ( @xmath73 ) is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a normalization constant .",
    "for a spherical shock with a constant expansion velocity , crs distribute like the yukawa potential in the cr precursor .",
    "we apply the above solution to currently accelerated particles ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "highest - energy particles being accelerated at present satisfy the condition of @xmath77 because the maximum energy is now limited by a finite age .",
    "hence , the largest length scale of the cr precursor is given by @xmath78 interestingly , the ratio @xmath79 depends only on @xmath32 .    in order to calculate a downstream distribution of accelerated particles",
    "precisely , we need to solve numerically the diffusion convection equation with radiative and adiabatic cooling . compared with the upstream region ,",
    "the downstream flow is complicated because there is a contact discontinuity and recent simulations showed that the strong turbulence is generated in the downstream region by several mechanisms @xcite . then , not only the standard diffusion but also the turbulent diffusion becomes important @xcite . in this paper , we simply assume the downstream distribution ( @xmath80 ) of currently and previously accelerated particles as follows .",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 is the step function , that is @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 , describing a finite size of the shocked region . by using equations  ( [ eq : nu ] ) , ( [ eq : nd ] ) , and the energy spectrum of accelerated electrons derived in section  [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "we calculate radial profiles of the inverse compton and the synchrotron emissions .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows radial profiles of @xmath0-ray and x - ray images projected on the sky .",
    "the black and blue solid curves are for @xmath0-rays above @xmath87 and x - rays above @xmath88 , that are smoothed by a gaussian function with a width of @xmath89 .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the shock position .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray profile extends more than the shock position and the x - ray profile , which is consistent with our model curve with @xmath90 ( black solid curve ) .",
    "@xmath90 means that the downstream diffusion length scale is much smaller than that in the upstream region @xcite , which suggests strong magnetic field fluctuations in the downstream region .",
    "the shock upstream region ( @xmath91 ) is dim in x - rays above @xmath88 because of the weak magnetic field , but bright in @xmath0-rays by inverse compton emission because seed photons are inevitably present .",
    "the radial profile in the outer region ( @xmath91 ) does not depend on the downstream electron distribution . as an example",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig:3 ] radial profiles of another model without the step function in equation  ( [ eq : nd ] ) ( dashed curves ) .",
    "one can see that the differences appear only in the interior region .",
    "in this paper , we assumed that all particles previously accelerated do not escape from the snr .",
    "in order to supply crs to the interstellar medium from snrs , crs have to escape from snrs .",
    "in fact , @xmath0-ray observations shows that middle - aged or old snrs actually supply cr protons ( or nuclei ) to the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "hence , accelerated electrons have to escape from the snr eventually . in this model ,",
    "@xmath0-rays above @xmath87 from the cr precursor ( @xmath91 ) are mainly emitted by highest - energy electrons currently accelerated ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "if higher - energy @xmath0-rays extend more than @xmath87 , it could be an evidence that electrons previously accelerated ( @xmath93 ) have already started to escape from the snr . the cherenkov telescope array ( cta , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be able to observe many snrs with better sensitivity and angular resolution , that will allow us to identify the cr precursor or escaping cr halo .    in this paper",
    ", we consider only the acceleration of electrons .",
    "however , it is expected that protons and nuclei are accelerated and they produce the cr precursor .",
    "therefore , the extended @xmath0-ray profile could be explained by hadronic models @xcite . for the parameters adopted in this paper , the maximum energy of accelerated particles in the past does not reach @xmath94 ( the knee ) , which is shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "however , other parameter sets , for example , a smaller @xmath24 makes @xmath95 larger .",
    "if so , @xmath0-rays originated from hadrons could appear in @xmath96 range , that might be observed by cta @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we considered the evolution of maximum energy of accelerated electrons in the snr rx j1713.7@xmath13946 that is expanding in a cavity and their forward shock is now very close to the cavity wall .",
    "we assume that the diffusion coefficient around the snr shock increases toward the cavity wall because there are neutral particles in the outside of the cavity",
    ". then , the maximum energy of particles being accelerated at the shock decreases with time , so that an accumulated energy spectrum of accelerated electrons breaks without radiative cooling .",
    "we have shown that our leptonic model could explain the observed spectrum from radio to tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "in addition , our model could naturally explain the radial profile of @xmath0-rays , which is more extended than that of x - rays , by inverse compton emission from the cr precursor of currently accelerated electrons .",
    "cta will be able to observe the cr precursor of many snrs by direct imaging , that will open a new window on the cr physics .",
