    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) numerical models of type ia supernovae ( sn  ia ) have been extensively used to test general ideas about possible explosion mechanisms @xcite . in particular ,",
    "1d models have ruled out the possibility of a thermonuclear detonation , a supersonic shock - induced combustion mode , as a sole mechanism for sn  ia explosions .",
    "a detonation propagating through a high - density carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) produces mostly ni and almost none of the intermediate - mass elements , such as ne , mg , si , s , and ca , that are observed in sn  ia spectra .",
    "one - dimensional models have also shown that a detonation can produce intermediate - mass elements if it propagates through a low - density wd preexpanded during the initial deflagration stage of the explosion .",
    "these delayed - detonation models @xcite , which have a deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) at some stage of the thermonuclear explosion , are the most successful in reproducing observed characteristics of sne  ia .",
    "many crucial physical details , however , including the mechanism of ddt and the turbulent flame structure , are missing by definition from 1d models because sn  ia explosions are intrinsically three - dimensional ( 3d ) phenomena .",
    "recent 3d numerical simulations of thermonuclear deflagrations in a wd @xcite demonstrated the importance of 3d effects .",
    "in particular , they have shown that the development of a turbulent thermonuclear flame in the gravitational field of a wd allows funnels of unburned and partially burned material to remain in the vicinity of the wd center until the end of the explosion .",
    "this would produce distinct signatures of low - velocity carbon , oxygen , and intermediate - mass elements in sn  ia spectra .",
    "as the observed spectra do not show these signatures , the predictions of the pure deflagration model are inconsistent with observations .",
    "this inconsistency can be resolved if the turbulent flame triggers a detonation that can burn the remaining material near the wd center @xcite . here",
    ", we report results numerical simulations of sn  ia explosions based on a 3d delayed - detonation model .",
    "this work extends and clarifies the brief letter @xcite by providing a detailed description of the model and the results , including numerical convergence studies and extended data analysis .",
    "the numerical model @xcite is based on reactive euler equations that include gravity terms and are coupled with an equation of state for a degenerate matter and a simplified kinetics of energy release .",
    "the equations are integrated on a cartesian adaptive mesh using an explicit , second - order , godunov - type numerical scheme .",
    "the model describes compressible fluid dynamics on large scales in an exploding wd including the expansion of a star , rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities , turbulence , pressure waves , shocks , and detonations .",
    "the nuclear kinetics is approximated by a four - equation mechanism @xcite that describes the energy release , consumption of carbon , nse and nsqe relaxations , and neutronization .",
    "appendix  a describes details of the nuclear kinetics approximation and explains how it can be used to estimate cumulative mass fractions of major groups of elements .",
    "the model is able to reproduce the two different regimes of the thermonuclear burning in a wd , a subsonic deflagration and a supersonic detonation .",
    "these regimes differ by the mechanism of propagation of the reaction wave : a deflagration involves heat conduction or turbulent mixing , and a detonation involves shock compression . for both regimes ,",
    "the energy is released by the same network of thermonuclear reactions , and the physical thickness of the reaction front strongly depends on density .",
    "it can be up to 12 orders of magnitude less than the wd radius @xmath2 for deflagrations @xcite and up to 10 orders of magnitude less than @xmath2 for detonations",
    "since the large - scale simulations described here do not resolve lengthscales smaller than @xmath3 , the reaction fronts at high densities are still unresolved .",
    "we explicitly resolve only parts of the reaction zone associated with nse relaxation that become very large at low densities and cause an incomplete burning that produces si and other intermediate - mass elements .",
    "unresolved reaction fronts are treated differently for deflagrations and detonations . for deflagrations ,",
    "the flame is advanced using a flame - capturing algorithm described in appendix  b that ensures the flame propagation with a prescribed speed .",
    "the flame speed is provided by an additional subgrid model @xcite that takes into account physical processes at scales smaller than the computational cell size . in particular",
    ", it assumes that turbulent burning on small unresolved scales is driven by the gravity - induced rt instability .",
    "this approach works only if we explicitly resolve enough scales to ensure that the resolved turbulent flame structure corresponds to the flame properties build into the subgrid model .",
    "extensive numerical resolution tests have shown that the minimum computational cell size @xmath4  cm used here for the deflagration stage is adequate for this type of simulation @xcite .    for detonations , a front - capturing algorithm and a subgrid model",
    "are not needed because the quasi - steady - state velocity of a detonation wave and the equilibrium composition of detonation products do not depend on the kinetics of energy release .",
    "we thus can artificially limit the maximum reaction rate in order to increase the reaction - zone thickness to several computational cells and ensure the numerical stability .",
    "we implement this by requiring that the mass fraction of carbon should not change by more than 0.1 per timestep .",
    "the resulting artificially thick detonation wave described only by reactive euler equations maintains the correct velocity and burns the material to the equilibrium products regardless of the computational cell size .",
    "resolution tests performed for the detonation stage for @xmath5  cm and @xmath6  cm show no substantial differences in results ( see also fig .  5 and related discussion below ) .",
    "transient detonation phenomena , such as detonation initiation and extinction , can not be correctly reproduced without resolving the structure of the detonation wave , and are not included in the simulations .",
    "the initial conditions for the deflagration stage model a @xmath7 wd in hydrostatic equilibrium with initial radius @xmath8  cm , initial central density @xmath9  g/@xmath10 , spatially uniform initial temperature @xmath11  k , and uniform initial composition with equal mass fractions of @xmath12c and @xmath13o nuclei .",
    "the burning was initiated at the center of wd by filling a small spherical region at @xmath14 with hot reaction products without disturbing the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we model one octant of the wd assuming mirror symmetry along the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 planes .",
    "the computational domain is a cube with a side of @xmath18  cm .",
    "the development of the thermonuclear flame was described in detail earlier @xcite and is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the initially spherical flame propagates outwards with a laminar velocity @xmath19@xmath20  km / s , becomes distorted due to the rt instability , and forms multiple plumes at different scales .",
    "the flame distortions at small unresolved scales are taken into account by the turbulent subgrid model that controls the normal flame speed .",
    "as the flame grows and the star expands , the normal flame speed remains close to @xmath19@xmath20  km / s , which is small compared to the sound speed @xmath21  km / s ahead of the flame . on resolved scales , the flame forms a dynamic convoluted surface penetrated in all directions by very irregular funnels of unburned material .",
    "buoyancy causes the hot , burned , low - density material inside the flame plumes to rise towards the wd surface .",
    "the same gravitational forces also pull the cold , unburned , high - density material between the plumes down towards the center .",
    "this material continues to burn , but it will not burn out completely as long as convective flows supply fresh unburned material from outer layers .    at high densities ,",
    "carbon and oxygen burning produces mostly ni and other iron - group elements .",
    "the energy released increases the temperature of burned material to @xmath19@xmath22  k and causes the wd to expand .",
    "when the density of unburned material becomes lower than @xmath23  g/@xmath10 , the deflagration begins to produce si and other intermediate - mass elements .",
    "these elements form everywhere along the flame surface , starting from the outer layers reached by the large plumes , and continuing around unburned funnels in the inner parts of the wd .",
    "the 3d distribution of elements predicted at 1.94  s after ignition is shown in fig  2d .",
    "the expansion eventually quenches the burning when the density of unburned material drops below @xmath24@xmath25  g/@xmath10 .",
    "the unburned carbon and oxygen remaining between the flame plumes and intermediate - mass elements that form at low densities at different radii are likely to survive the explosion .",
    "as we have shown @xcite , this makes predictions of the 3d deflagration model inconsistent with observed spectra of sn  ia .",
    "the disagreement between predictions from the pure deflagration simulation and observations strongly suggests that the turbulent flame in sn  ia triggers a detonation .",
    "the process of ddt involves events occuring at small scales that are comparable to the detonation wave thickness , and , thus , can not be directly modeled in large - scale simulations . to study the effects of a detonation",
    ", we therefore assume a time and a location for ddt .",
    "( a similar approach has been used previously in 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite delayed - detonation models . )",
    "we use the deflagration results as initial conditions , and impose a hot spot to ignite the detonation .",
    "the time and location for the detonation initiation are parameters that can be varied and optimized . here",
    ", we explore the three cases defined in table  [ table1 ] .",

    ", the density of unburnt material near the center has dropped to @xmath33  g/@xmath10 .",
    "a detonation at this density produces mostly ni and propagates outwards at @xmath19@xmath34  km / s , which is comparable to the expansion velocities induced by subsonic burning .",
    "when the detonation reaches unburned material with density below @xmath23  g/@xmath10 , it begins to produce intermediate - mass elements .",
    "different parts of the detonation front that exit different funnels collide with each other , coalesce , and eventually reach the surface of the star .",
    "the detonation transforms all carbon and oxygen in central parts the wd into iron - group elements , and produces intermediate - mass elements in outer layers .",
    "this drastically changes the distribution of nuclei compared to that produced by the pure deflagration .",
    "figure  2a shows that funnels of unburned carbon and oxygen disappear from central parts of the wd .",
    "iron - group elements form a distinct core surrounded by a layer of intermediate - mass nuclei .",
    "angle - averaged mass fractions of the main elements calculated for the deflagration and the delayed - detonation models as functions of distance from the wd center are compared in fig .",
    "similar results were obtained for the delayed - detonation case ( c ) with earlier central initiation at 1.51  s. the detonation starts in the material with density @xmath35  g/@xmath10 propagates outwards , and almost completely covers the flame plumes by 1.82  s , as shown in the righ column of fig .  1 .",
    "by that time , that corresponds to figs .",
    "2c , 3c , and 4c , the shock already reached the wd surface , burned almost all of the carbon , and left unburned oxygen in low - density outer layers .",
    "the integral mass distribution of the main elements in fig .",
    "4 shows that case ( c ) produced more iron - group elements than case ( a ) because the detonation propagated through higher - density material .",
    "figure  2c shows that iron - group elements form a more compact core because the flame plumes had less time to develop .",
    "intermediate - mass elements also form a more distinct shell with a higher si peak in fig .  3c . thus ,",
    "the earlier detonation initiation results in more symmetrical , shell - like distribution of elements .    cases ( a ) and ( c ) were computed with two different numerical resolutions with @xmath5  cm and @xmath6  cm .",
    "total energies for these cases are shown in fig .  5 as functions of time .",
    "dotted lines correspond to the lower resolution and show a slightly lower energy release compared to high - resolution results .",
    "the difference ( 6% for the case ( a ) and 3% for the case ( c ) ) is insignificant and related to small pockets of unburned material that remain behind the shock propagating through the turbulent flame in low - resolution simulations .",
    "the delayed - detonation case ( b ) was computed only with the low resolution ( @xmath5  cm ) .",
    "this case is interesting because it shows asymmetrical effects created by an off - center detonation initiation .",
    "the simulation results for this case show a moderate asymmetry in final composition .",
    "the asymmetry is limited because we calculate only one octant of a wd and impose mirror boundary conditions .",
    "the degree of asymmetry would increase if the simulations were performed for a full star .",
    "then the second mirror - reflected spot for detonation initiation would be eliminated .",
    "the simulation results indicate that , during the period of detonation propagation , the density of the expanding unreacted material ahead of the shock can decrease by an order of magnitude compared to its value at the end of the deflagration stage . because the detonation burns material to different products at different densities , it can create a large - scale asymmetry in composition if it starts far from the wd center .",
    "a similar conclusion based on 2d simulations was made by @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional simulations of the deflagration stage @xcite also show that a developing flame , unrestricted by mirror boundaries , can move away from the wd center , thus creating a large - scale asymmetry at very early stages of the explosion .",
    "the first result that can be compared to observations is the energy released by the explosion .",
    "total energies for all three delayed - detonation cases and the deflagration model are compared in fig .",
    "the total energy @xmath36 here is the difference between the energy released by thermonuclear reactions and the binding energy of the star .",
    "eventually @xmath36 will be transformed into kinetic energy of expanding material that can be measured in observations of sn  ia .",
    "figure  5 shows that the total energy predicted by delayed - detonation models , @xmath0  ergs , is much higher than the total energy predicted by the deflagration model @xmath19@xmath1  ergs .",
    "the reason for this is that the deflagration is able to burn only about a half of the wd mass .",
    "the rest of the material expands to the densities below @xmath24@xmath25  g/@xmath10 that do not support the thermonuclear burning .",
    "a detonation propagates faster and burns almost all of the wd mass before the material expands to low densities .",
    "a small difference in energy curves plotted in fig .",
    "5 for the delayed - detonation cases ( a ) and ( b ) indicates that the off - center detonation initiation in this model has only a minor effect on the energy release .",
    "case ( c ) , with earlier detonation initiation , resulted in a faster explosion that released 15% more energy .",
    "the total energy released by the delayed - detonation models is in agreement with a typical range @xmath37  ergs obtained from sn  ia observations @xcite .",
    "another result that can be compared to observations is the total mass of radioactive @xmath38ni that provides the energy source for the observed luminosity of sn  ia .",
    "the simplified kinetic model we use in these simulations does not provide the exact concentration of @xmath38ni , but it gives a cumulative concentration of iron - group elements , most of which is @xmath38ni . by the end of each simulation",
    "described here , all iron - group elements that could form during the explosion have already formed .",
    "even though some material is still burning and releasing energy for cases ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) ( see fig .  5 ) , the burning occurs at low densities and produces mostly intermediate - mass elements .",
    "the total mass of iron - group elements created by the explosion ( see fig .  4 ) is 0.78 , 0.73 , and 0.98 solar masses ( @xmath39 ) for delayed - detonation cases ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the mass of @xmath38ni estimated from observational data is about @xmath40 for a typical sn  ia @xcite , and is in agreement with the total mass of iron - group elements produced by delayed - detonation models . for the deflagration model ,",
    "the total mass of iron - group elements is only 0.47 @xmath39 , which is insufficient to account for the luminosity of a typical sn  ia .",
    "distributions of carbon , oxygen , and intermediate - mass elements predicted by the models also can be checked against observations . in the simulations , detonations burn all carbon and oxygen in inner parts of wd .",
    "oxygen remains unburned in outer layers , which expand to densities below @xmath24@xmath25  g/@xmath10 before the detonation reaches them .",
    "carbon is likely to remain unburned for densities below @xmath41  g/@xmath10 .",
    "these unburned carbon and oxygen in outer layers would produce spectral signatures only in the high - velocity range .",
    "there are ways in which a delayed detonation can leave small amounts of carbon and oxygen in inner parts of wd .",
    "for example , a detonation propagating through a thin , sinuous funnel of unburned material can fail if the funnel makes a sharp turn .",
    "this detonation failure occurs as a result of detonation diffraction process that is well - known for terrestrial systems .",
    "a developing turbulent flame can also disconnect some funnels from the rest of the unburned material , thus creating unburned pockets that can not be directly reached by a detonation wave .",
    "some of these pockets may not ignite when strong shocks generated by detonations reach them .",
    "the cellular structure of thermonuclear detonations in carbon - oxygen matter @xcite , and the ability of cellular detonations to form pockets of unburned material that extend far behind the 1d reaction zone , can also contribute into incomplete burning .",
    "all these phenomena occur at lengthscales comparable to the reaction zone thickness that are not resolved in large - scale simulations reported here , and thus require additional studies",
    ".    there have recently been efforts to detect low - velocity carbon in sn  ia spectra that could result from the funnels of unburned material near the wd center @xcite .",
    "the results @xcite indicate that carbon can be present at velocities 11,000  km / s .",
    "even though this velocity is much lower than 20,000 - 30,000  km / s usually attributed to carbon in sn  ia spectra @xcite , it is still too high for the ejecta formed from central parts of a wd . for carbon and oxygen ,",
    "spectral signatures are difficult to observe , and estimated velocities of these elements are subject to large uncertainties .",
    "intermediate - mass elements , however , produce distinct spectral lines and their velocities are well defined .",
    "the minimum observed velocities for intermediate - mass elements @xcite are large enough ( @xmath19@xmath42  km / s for si ) to rule out the presence of these elements near the wd center , as is predicted by the deflagration model .",
    "a discussion on this subject can also be found in the recent article by @xcite .",
    "figures 2 - 4 show that , in contrast to the 3d deflagration model , the 3d delayed - detonation model of sn  ia explosion does _ not _ leave carbon , oxygen , and intermediate - mass elements in central parts of a wd .",
    "this removes the key disagreement between simulations and observations , and makes the 3d delayed detonation a promising mechanism for sn  ia explosion .",
    "further analysis of 3d delayed detonations on large scale requires 3d radiation transport simulations to produce spectra , and a detailed comparison between the calculated and observed spectra of sn  ia for different initiation times and locations .",
    "the uncertainty in detonation initiation can only be eliminated by solving the ddt problem that requires resolving physical processes at small scales .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nasa atp program ( nra-02-oss-01-atp ) and by the naval research laboratory ( nrl ) through the office of naval research .",
    "computing facilities were provided by the dod hpcmp program .",
    "we would like to thank peter hflich and j. craig wheeler for useful discussions .",
    "nuclear reactions involved in the thermonuclear burning of the carbon - oxygen mixture @xcite can be separated into three consecutive stages responsible for the energy release .",
    "first , the @xmath12c  +  @xmath12c reaction leads to the consumption of @xmath43 and formation of mostly ne , mg , protons , and @xmath44-particles . then begins the nuclear statistical quasi - equilibrium ( nsqe ) relaxation , during which @xmath45 burns out and si - group ( intermediate mass ) elements are formed .",
    "finally , si - group elements are converted into the fe - group elements and the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) sets in .",
    "the reaction time scales @xmath46 associated with these stages strongly depend on temperature and density and may differ from one another by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the full nuclear reaction network includes hundreds of species that participate in thousands of reactions .",
    "integration of this full network is too time - consuming to be used in multidimensional numerical models .",
    "therefore , we used a simplified four - equation kinetic scheme @xcite that describes the energy release , nse and nsqe relaxations , and neutronization of nse matter .",
    "the kinetic equation for the mole fraction of carbon @xmath47 @xmath48 describes carbon consumption through the major reactions @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the branching ratio @xmath241 . here",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a known function @xcite .",
    "most of the nuclear energy is released during the carbon exhaustion stage and the subsequent synthesis of the si - group nuclei .",
    "the energy release or consumption due to the transition from si - group to fe - group nuclei ( nse relaxation ) is less than 10% .",
    "therefore , the nuclear energy release rate is approximated as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the binding energy of nuclei per unit mass , @xmath56 ergs g@xmath57 mol@xmath57 is the energy release due to carbon burning described by eq .",
    "( [ eqs1 ] ) , and @xmath58 is the binding energy of matter in the state of nse .",
    "the equation @xmath59 traces the onset of nse , where @xmath60 in the unburned matter and @xmath61 in the nse products .",
    "intermediate mass elements are expected where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "fe - group elements are expected where @xmath62 and @xmath64 .",
    "the ` e - folding ' nsqe and nse timescales @xmath65 approximate the results of the detailed calculations of carbon burning .",
    "neutronization is described by the equation for the electron mole fraction @xmath66 , @xmath67    the corresponding term describing neutrino energy losses , @xmath68 , is added to the nuclear energy release rate used in reactive euler equations .",
    "values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 were computed assuming nse distribution of individual nuclei , as described in @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an important development in theoretical computations which shows significantly smaller electron capture and @xmath72-decay rates in stellar matter ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "following @xcite , this effect was approximately taken into account by decreasing @xmath70 and @xmath71 by a factor of @xmath73 .",
    "this should be sufficient to account for changes in @xmath69 and in the corresponding nuclear energy release @xmath74 caused by variations of @xmath66 .",
    "the original kinetic scheme @xcite also contained the equation for the mean ion mole fraction @xmath75 .",
    "here we neglect variations of @xmath75 due to nuclear reactions since ions make a small contribution to the equation of state .",
    "a constant @xmath76 was used instead , which is an average of @xmath75 in the unburned and typical nse matter in the sn  ia explosion conditions .    despite its simplicity",
    ", the kinetic scheme adequately describes all major stages of the thermonuclear burning in a carbon - oxygen wd .",
    "in particular , it takes into account the important effect of energy release or absorbtion caused by changes in nse composition when matter expands or contracts ( these changes happen on a quasi - equilibrium rather than on the equilibrium timescale ) .",
    "when the wd expands , this effect adds @xmath2450% to the energy initially released by burning at high densities .",
    "using even the simplest 13-species @xmath44-network to account for this effect would be prohibitively expensive in 3d simulations of sn  ia explosions .",
    "the same kinetic scheme was used in @xcite for the deflagration stage , but the nuclear energy release was overestimated by about 17% due to an incorrect numerical implementation . here use a corrected model that produces slightly slower and less energetic deflagrations .",
