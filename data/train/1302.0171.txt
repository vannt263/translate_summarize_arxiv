    "the remarkable difference between the probabilistic dynamics of microscopic quantum particles and the deterministic nature of macroscopic classical objects remains a long - standing puzzle since the advent of quantum mechanics .",
    "models of spontaneous collapse of wavefunctions @xcite is one attempt to unify these two apparently different dynamics by modifying the schrdinger equation with additional non - linear terms which breakdown the superposition of wavefunctions at macroscopic level yielding deterministic dynamics for classical objects",
    ". these non - linear terms also act as amplification mechanism such that the modified dynamics only affect the macroscopic dynamics preserving the probabilistic nature of the microscopic ones . among many attempts to construct models of spontaneous collapse of wavefunction continuous spontaneous localization ( csl )",
    "@xcite model is one which will be of our main focus in this discussion .",
    "this model has two free parameters , the collapse rate @xmath0 and the width of the localization @xmath1 , whose theoretical origins are yet to be determined .",
    "also , in its present form the csl mechanism is only applicable to non - relativistic particles .",
    "the consequence of adding non - linear terms to schrdinger equation is that the energy of the system increases with time and the energy density of a system containing a species @xmath2 increases with a rate as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the mass of a non - relativistic particle of that species and @xmath6 is the number density . in generic csl",
    "scenario the collapse rate @xmath0 is taken to be independent of the mass of the non - relativistic particle .",
    "but in a variant scenario it is considered to be proportional to the square of the mass of the particle under consideration as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of a nucleon .",
    "this scenario shows that the collapse rate can be different for different species and the collapse rate is higher for heavier ones .",
    "we will investigate the cosmological implications of such a feature of csl in this talk and put constraint on @xmath0 from various cosmological facts and observations .",
    "we will now investigate the cosmological consequences of heating up of non - relativistic particles in the cosmic soup due to csl mechanism .",
    "first of all , as the total energy density of the particles change with a constant rate duo to csl heating the evolution of energy density of non - relativistic matter in the radiation and matter dominated eras changes which can be given as @xcite @xmath9\\right\\}\\left(\\frac{1+z_f}{1+z_i}\\right)^3\\rho_{m_i},\\\\ \\rho_{m_f}^{\\rm md}&=&\\exp\\left\\{k_{\\rm csl , md}\\left[\\frac{1}{(1+z_f)^\\frac32}-\\frac{1}{(1+z_i)^\\frac32}\\right]\\right\\}\\left(\\frac{1+z_f}{1+z_i}\\right)^3\\rho_{m_i } , \\label{rho - rd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we demand that the csl mechanism will not effect the standard evolution of the non - relativistic matter during radiation and matter dominated phases of the universe .",
    "next we see that the precise blackbody spectrum of cmbr indicates that the radiation and matter were in perfect thermal equilibrium before decoupling at @xmath12 .",
    "compton scattering is the most significant process in thermalization of cosmic plasma once the photon number non - conserving processes die out at @xmath13 .",
    "the time of thermalization due to compton scattering is @xmath14 we demand that the csl heating rate should be much smaller than the compton thermalization rate so that the radiation and matter in the cosmic soup can attain thermal equilibrium to yield a perfect blackbody spectrum .",
    "energy injections at early epochs in the cosmic plasma via direct heating of particles or by injecting high frequency photons relaxes the planck spectrum of the thermalized photon density to a bose - einstein distribution with a non - zero chemical potential @xmath15 .",
    "this is known as the @xmath16type spectral distortion of cmbr .",
    "cobe / firas @xcite puts an upper bound on such a distortion of the blackbody spectrum as @xmath17 whereas an upcoming experiment pixie @xcite can constrain it up to @xmath18 .",
    "csl heating can yield a @xmath16type distortion in the cmbr of the amount @xcite : @xmath19 one can constrain @xmath0 from the upper - bounds on @xmath16type distortions from these two experiments .",
    "if energy releases in the early universe during @xmath20 makes the temperature of the electrons greater than that of the photons then low - energy photons will be upscattered in frequency via compton scattering causing a deficit of photons in the low frequency regime and an increment of photons at high frequencies in comparison with a standard blackbody spectrum .",
    "such a distortion is known as the @xmath21type distortion of the cmbr spectrum .",
    "cobe / firas @xcite puts an upper bound on such a distortion of the blackbody spectrum as @xmath22 whereas an upcoming experiment pixie @xcite can constrain it up to @xmath23 .",
    "one can calculate the amount of @xmath21type distortion due to csl heating of non - relativistic particles by @xcite @xmath24 hence , upper - bounds on such a distortion from the two experiments mentioned above can also constrain the parameter @xmath0 of csl .",
