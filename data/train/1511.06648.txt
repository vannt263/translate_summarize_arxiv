    "as the second most abundant molecule in the universe , carbon monoxide ( co ) is commonly detected in a variety of astrophysical environments . as early as the 1970 s ,",
    "the infrared ro - vibrational bands of co were observed in late - type stars @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite and @xcite detected co ro - vibrational lines in the spectra of young stellar objects and the sun . in a sample of nine infrared sources identified by @xcite ,",
    "eight sources show evidence of a hot gas component with temperatures of 120 to 1010  k and co ro - vibrational emission .",
    "recently , @xmath6 ro - vibrational transitions of co near 4.7 @xmath7 m have been observed in star - forming regions , protoplanetary disks , and external galaxies using high - resolution spectrometers @xcite .",
    "analysis of these co spectral lines provides the physical conditions and chemical composition of the interstellar gas , in particular the kinetic temperature , column density , volume density , and molecular abundances .",
    "many of the analyses assumed that the co ro - vibrational emission is based on local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) populations , which , however , applies only in high - density regions where collisions dominate the excitations .",
    "non - lte modeling is necessary when infrared and uv fluorescent excitation and radiative de - excitation compete with molecular collisions @xcite , and it is required for a detailed understanding of the co ro - vibrational lines in terms of spatial location and efficiency of the ir / uv fluorescence @xcite .",
    "the non - lte analysis requires accurate collision rate coefficients of co with its main collision partners , h , h@xmath5 , he , and electrons , as input .",
    "the lack , or limited reliability , of such rate coefficient data hinders non - lte modeling of molecular spectra for many astrophysical environments .",
    "in particular , rate coefficients for the h - co system are known to be highly uncertain @xcite and difficult to calculate due to the existence of a chemical bond between h and co. the appearance of a deep well and a dissociation barrier in the h - co potential make it substantially more difficult to compute converged scattering cross sections than for typical van der waals systems such as he - co and h@xmath5-co .",
    "in addition , it was shown in @xcite that standard approaches for scaling he - co rate coefficients to obtain values for h@xmath5-co or , especially , h - co are not valid .",
    "for pure rotational transitions , rate coefficients of h - co were first given by @xcite about four decades ago for co excitation from @xmath8 to @xmath9 at temperatures of @xmath10  k. one year later , @xcite reported their values for transitions from initial states with @xmath11 at temperatures of @xmath12  k. rate coefficients for pure rotational transitions up to @xmath13 for a broad range of gas temperatures @xmath14  k , were calculated by @xcite .",
    "compared with the earlier values of @xcite , their results differed by a factor of 30 for rate coefficients at temperatures below 100  k. more recently , @xcite performed scattering calculations with two new _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces and suggested that the pure rotational rate coefficients obtained by @xcite were incorrect , due to the fact that the wks interaction potential @xcite they used for h - co was inaccurate in its long range part .",
    "in a recent paper , @xcite calculated the rotational quenching rate coefficients of low - lying ( @xmath15 ) rotational co levels for temperatures ranging from 1 to 3000  k. they found pure rotational quenching rate coefficients similar to the values of @xcite , which confirms the inaccuracy of results obtained using the wks potential @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite performed calculations of the pure rotational quenching rates for initial states up to @xmath16 at a temperature range of @xmath17  k based on the new three - dimensional ( 3d ) h - co potential of @xcite .    for vibrational rate coefficients",
    "the situation is still unsatisfactory , however .",
    "experimental values are available only for the rotationally unresolved @xmath18 transition .",
    "the most reliable results were measured by @xcite using a discharge - flow shock tube at temperatures between 840 and 2680  k. other experimental values reported by @xcite and @xcite are based on estimates of the efficiency of h atoms in vibrational relaxation of co derived from data involving other gases .",
    "quantum scattering calculations of rate coefficients for transitions between vibrational levels up to @xmath19 were performed by @xcite with the infinite order sudden ( ios ) approximation at temperatures ranging from 100 to 3000  k. their computed results agreed with the experimental data measured by @xcite in the high - temperature range .",
    "vibrational rate coefficients below 100  k were not available , however .",
    "rate coefficients for ro - vibrational transitions were even less complete .",
    "@xcite presented quenching rate coefficients for initial states @xmath20 to @xmath21 at a temperature range of @xmath22 k. they performed close - coupling ( cc ) calculations , but their channel basis may have been too small to ensure convergence and they adopted the wks potential @xcite , known to be inaccurate in the long range .",
    "both factors may lead to uncertainties in the ro - vibrational rate coefficients and the lack of a comprehensive set of h - co ro - vibrational rate coefficients obliged astronomers to use scaling laws to extrapolate the data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite modeled co ro - vibrational emission from herbig ae discs using the h - co rate coefficients calculated by @xcite .",
    "they extrapolated the pure rotational de - excitation rate coefficients to initial states with @xmath23 and vibrational transition rate coefficients to temperatures below 100  k. assuming complete decoupling of rotational and vibrational motion , they estimated the state - to - state ro - vibrational rate coefficients from the corresponding rates for pure rotational transitions in the ground vibrational level .",
    "this method was described in detail and applied to the h@xmath5o - h@xmath5 system by @xcite . however",
    ", extrapolations based on only a few calculated rate coefficients may cause large errors in the deduced rates .",

    "we report explicitly calculated state - to - state ro - vibrational de - excitation rate coefficients for @xmath24 transitions in h - co for initial states with @xmath25 and 2 and @xmath26 values up to 30 for temperatures ranging from 10 to 3000  k. a new extrapolation method is devised and applied to obtain state - to - state ro - vibrational de - excitation rate coefficients for initial states with @xmath27 up to 5 .",

    "another advantage of our method is that it also yields the values for @xmath65 transitions ; these could not be obtained with the previous extrapolation method since the data for rotationally elastic @xmath66 transitions were not tabulated . and even if they had been available , they most likely would have given much too large extrapolated results .",
    "cross sections for ro - vibrational @xmath67 transitions from full cc calculations are reported in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we also concluded in that paper that the coupled states approximation is only suitable for collision energies above @xmath681000 @xmath33 for the h - co system and it is therefore not applied here .",
    "table  [ tab : rovir ] lists the ro - vibrational transition rate coefficients for a gas temperature range of 10  k @xmath69 3000  k calculated from these cross sections with the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "the highest final @xmath70 values for which the rates are given in this table depend on the initial @xmath26 quantum number .",
    "transitions for even larger final @xmath41 are not reported , either because they are negligibly small , or because they were not completely converged with the largest number of partial waves , i.e. , the highest total angular momentum @xmath71 included .",
    "however , we add all final @xmath41 states , including those that may not be fully converged , to calculate the vibrational quenching cross sections @xmath72 and the vibrational transition rate coefficients @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the cc vibrational quenching rate coefficients shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vv ] are slightly different from the values that would be obtained by summing and averaging only the reported rates @xmath74 .    in order to test our proposed extrapolation scheme , we also calculated cross sections and rate coefficients for ro - vibrational @xmath75 transitions with the cc method .",
    "we used a channel basis @xmath76 , where the notation @xmath77 represents a basis with the highest vibrational level @xmath78 and the highest rotational level @xmath79 for vibrational level @xmath80 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the state - to - state ro - vibrational rate coefficients were computed for a temperature range of 10  k @xmath81 3000  k ; they are listed in table  [ tab : rovir2 ] .",
    "in addition , we obtained vibrational quenching cross sections from scattering calculations in the ios approximation with a @xmath82 basis for co. this basis of 15 vibrational levels , with energies given in table [ tab : viblev ] , is sufficiently large to converge all @xmath83 transitions . in table  [ tab : vibr ] we report the ios vibrational transition rate coefficients for a temperature range of 10  k @xmath69 3000  k. the ios approximation is not always suitable for cross sections at low collision energy and for rate coefficients at low temperature .",
    "we check this by comparing the vibrational rate coefficients produced with the ios approximation and the results obtained by summing the state - to - state cc rate coefficients over final rotational @xmath41 levels and averaging over initial @xmath26 levels .",

    "first , we test the validity of the extrapolation method used by @xcite and @xcite . combining the ios vibrational rate coefficient for the @xmath89 transition with",
    "pure rotational ( vibrationally elastic ) rate coefficients from @xcite , both of them based on the 3d h - co potential of @xcite , we can obtain the state - to - state ro - vibrational rate coefficients for @xmath90 transitions by extrapolation .",
    "examples of the comparison of our cc rate coefficients , rate coefficients from extrapolation based on the method of @xcite and @xcite , and the corresponding rate coefficients used by @xcite are illustrated in fig .",

    "these large discrepancies result because the pure rotational ( vibrationally elastic ) transitions in @xmath21 are endoergic for @xmath93 , while the ro - vibrational quenching processes @xmath94 are exoergic for all @xmath95 even when @xmath96 .",
    "in addition , by analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq : pvv ] ) , the vibration - related scale factor @xmath97 can be rewritten in the extrapolation method of @xcite and @xcite as @xmath98 .",

    "the rate coefficients adopted in the modeling of @xcite are even more discrepant , as shown by the green lines with triangle markers in fig .",

    "let us now discuss the results from our new extrapolation method based on vibrationally inelastic rates from quantum scattering calculations . using the data in tables  [ tab : rovir ] and [ tab : vibr ] , the ro - vibrational rate coefficients for @xmath100 transitions",

    "for the four transitions shown , the new extrapolated rate coefficients agree very well with those from full cc calculations .",
    "the root mean square relative deviation of the rate coefficients in the temperature range of 10  k @xmath0 3000  k for all the transitions @xmath75 is 40% .",
    "this is sufficiently accurate for astronomical applications .",
    "however , the data from the scaling approach of @xcite deviate dramatically from our results , especially for higher final @xmath41 values .",
    "the reasons why their data are less accurate were already discussed above .",
    "the deviation is largest in the temperature range of 10  k @xmath103 100  k , probably because the vibrational transition rate coefficients at low temperature were not available at the time .",
    "in order to show the relevance of these new collision rate coefficients in the astrophysical context , we chose a twofold approach : ( 1 ) simple 1d slab models with constant temperature , density and co abundance and ( 2 ) the 2d radiative thermo - chemical disk model from @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we compare the results obtained with the old h - co collision rates to those obtained with the new data . since this paper presents new collision rates for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we restricted the calculations below to the same range of quantum numbers .",
    "prodimo is a 2d radiation thermo - chemical disk code @xcite .",

    "the gas temperatures can be used iteratively to find a vertical hydrostatic equilibrium solution .",
    "however , we use for this work a fixed parametrized gas scale height and assume that gas and dust are well mixed . details of the numerical methods , the chemical network and a list of heating / cooling processes can be found in @xcite .",

    "the code can be used in 1d slab mode , to calculate the emission emerging from a fixed total gas column with a constant gas temperature and constant volume densities of collision partners ( h , h@xmath5 , he and e@xmath106 ) .",
    "the non - lte level populations are calculated using the escape probability method taking into account also ir pumping by thermal dust emission . since we focus here on the effect of the new collisional rates , we minimize the effect of ir pumping by fixing the dust temperature at 20  k. the turbulent width",
    "is fixed to @xmath107  km / s and the total broadening is given by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the thermal velocity of the co molecules .",
    "the slab models provide a powerful means to exploit a very wide parameter space under which co emission could arise in space .",

    "more details on the dust opacities and vertical disk structure can be found in table  3 of @xcite .",
    "such a disk model does not provide any freedom as to the conditions under which co is emitting .",
    "its abundance , excitation and emission are calculated self - consistently given the density distribution of gas within the disk and the irradiating stellar and interstellar radiation field .",
    "we ran four series of models , each with three different total gas column densities of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116  @xmath117 .",
    "the co abundance is fixed at @xmath118 with respect to the total hydrogen number density .",

    "note that the gas in these slab models is not fully molecular , i.e. , the h / h@xmath5 abundance ratio is 1 .",
    "series 2 uses a lower gas temperature of @xmath123  k and the same collision partner densities .",
    "series 3 uses @xmath124  k and a lower density of collision partners , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ( in @xmath122 ) . an additional series ( 4 ) was calculated to isolate the effect of h - collisions . in this series ,",
    "the temperature and density of h are the same as in series 3 , while the collision partner densities of h@xmath5 , he and electrons are assumed to be negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig : coslab ] illustrates the change in the non - lte fluxes of the @xmath128 band resulting from the old and new collisional rates for h - co in the slab models .",
    "we note that changes are typically smallest for the slab with the largest line optical depth @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) . for slabs at @xmath124  k",
    ", the line fluxes with the new rates are smaller than those with the old rates .",
    "exceptions are the smaller and the highest @xmath26 levels ; the flux changes are generally largest for the lowest four levels .",
    "it is also evident from these comparisons that the implementation of the new rates will have an effect on the shape of the vibrational band structure .",
    "in most cases of high @xmath32 ( 800 k ) slabs , the band structure ( flux vs wavelength ) will get flatter for low @xmath26 and drop faster at high @xmath26 compared to the band structure with the old collision data .",
    "the total cooling rate of the @xmath128 band ( @xmath131 ) is typically 20 - 30% lower with the new collisional rates .",

[",

    "differences are small , on the order of @xmath137% .",
    "the line fluxes with the new rates show a clear pattern with respect to the old ones : the new rates lead to lower line fluxes at low @xmath26 , higher fluxes in the intermediate range and then again lower fluxes for @xmath138 .",
    "the upturn at the highest @xmath26 is a boundary effect , since the rotational states of co are artificially cut off in the model at @xmath139 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the co emission arises from a hot surface layer with @xmath140  k , where the gas is predominantly atomic ( see their fig.12 ) . at these high temperatures ,",
    "differences between the old and new collision rates are smaller than at low temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ccespure ] ) and this partially explains the relatively small changes observed in the disk model . in addition , ir pumping is competing with collisions , especially in the inner disk , where dust continuum emission peaks in the near - ir ( @xmath141  k ) .",
