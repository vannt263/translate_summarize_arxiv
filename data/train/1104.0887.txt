    "the dawning of the era of precision cosmology demands that we understand the history of our universe theoretically with the same accuracy as experiment .",
    "the _ wmap _ determination of acoustic peaks in the cmb spectrum to 1% accuracy has given strong support to the existence of an era of inflation @xcite .",
    "inflation , famously , predicts the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations underlying all structure in the universe .",
    "this ability of _ wmap _ and future _ planck _ data @xcite to constrain theoretical models of the early universe has set off a scramble to delineate a theoretically controlled computation of the primordial inflationary power spectrum .",
    "the textbook approach makes a number of explicit and implicit assumptions , each of which can affect the power spectrum at the accuracy measured .",
    "the main assumption is that the density spectrum can be reduced to that of an adiabatic fluid whose excitations are always weakly coupled to gravity .",
    "this can be conveniently encoded in a single scalar field lagrangian with bunch - davies initial conditions in a fixed inflationary cosmology without metric fluctuations .",
    "the most obvious issue with these assumptions is that the redshifts implied by the 60 @xmath1-folds of inflation necessary to solve the horizon and flatness problem , place the relevant momentum scales in an energy regime far beyond the planck - scale , where in principle gravitational backreaction and quantum - gravity corrections can not be ignored @xcite .",
    "turning the issue around , it also implies a window of opportunity that quantum gravity or any other new physics arising at high energy scales could have a measurable effect on the power spectrum .",
    "this question was actively pursued some time ago with the conclusion that in toy models @xcite one can obtain measurable corrections of the order @xmath0 , comparable to intrinsic cosmic variance , with @xmath2 the hubble scale and @xmath3 the scale of new physics @xcite .    to truly connect with the data one needs the _ universal generic _ model - independent corrections to the power spectrum in terms of an effective field theory that encodes order by order the corrections due to new physics at high scales as well as deviations from adiabaticity .",
    "how to account for new physics is formally well - understood in terms of wilsonian effective actions , and for the adiabatic mode this has been actively pursued recently @xcite . however , wilsonian effective actions are only consistent provided adiabaticity is maintained @xcite . in practice",
    "this has meant that energy is assumed to be a conserved quantity .",
    "but precisely this is impossible in a cosmological time - dependent background",
    ". redshifts continuously mix the regimes of various scales and strictly speaking a well - defined separation of energy can not be maintained .",
    "this long - standing paradox has fundamentally hampered the construction of low energy effective theories in cosmological spacetimes , _ literally _ since energy is not a conserved quantity .    in a previous letter",
    "@xcite we provided an algorithmic solution to this obstacle to compute the generic new physics corrections to the inflationary power spectrum .",
    "one can generate the universal low energy effective action by integrating out a massive field in any particular new physics model .",
    "this is sensible in a cosmological setting , as long as one computes late time expectation values directly in non - equilibrium real - time qft via the schwinger - keldysh approach .",
    "one of the principal difficulties found in previous approaches was the correct procedure to implement an energy and momentum scale cutoff in a time - dependent background ; in intermediate steps the order of energy and momentum integrals now no longer commute .",
    "we have overcome this through the realization that the contributions from the massive field may be reliably captured in a stationary - phase approximation for vertex evaluation .",
    "this localizes interactions to fixed moments in time and allows us to unambigously implement the cutoff in momenta .",
    "there are several noteworthy features that this algorithmic solution reveals :    * most importantly , new physics and non - adiabatic corrections no longer separate . integrating out the heavy field not only causes changes in the action , but also in the effective density matrix of the low - energy field .",
    "the former can account for non - adiabatic effects .",
    "* the non - adiabatic terms are non - local in position space , but localized on a new physics hypersurface where the physical momentum @xmath4 equals the mass of the heavy field @xmath5 .",
    "intuitively this is what should happen and was the basis of many earlier _ ad hoc _ models .",
    "here it is a consequence of integrating out the heavy field . *",
    "these terms can be interpreted as modified initial conditions for the low - energy adiabatic inflaton .",
    "this again confirms the qualitative insights gained from toy models , but now quantitatively .    in this article",
    "we apply this cosmological effective field theory approach to the cosmologically relevant scenario of slow - roll inflation .",
    "we compute the corrections to the scalar power spectrum resulting from interactions with a heavy field . parametrizing the corrections in a manner expedient to comparison with observational data ,",
    "the _ universal generic _ correction to the scalar power spectrum due to unknown high - energy physics equals @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the first slow - roll coefficient .",
    "the power of the approach , however , is that each of the variables @xmath8 can be _ computed _ in terms of the parameters of whichever theoretical model for the unknown new physics one has in mind . for the power spectrum the result is merely an amplitude correction , but it will be very interesting to see the effect in higher - order correlation functions .    this article is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present a simple model of slow - roll inflation containing new physics at high energies and analyze the field fluctuations in two gauges which will prove useful . in ",
    "3 we review the in - in formalism and how to compute field fluctuation correlations for our theory . in ",

    "in summary , we have developed a technique to explicitly calculate the generic corrections to the inflaton power spectrum from fundamental high energy physics .",
    "these can be connected to microscopic models through a `` generalized '' boundary effective field theory as in @xcite .",
    "why does the naive effective action of the power spectrum fail ? for three reasons :    1 .",
    "correlation functions ( such as the power spectrum ) must be computed using the in - in formalism , significantly altering the role of classical and quantum fluctuations .",
    "the expanding background means that heavy fluctuations can now be excited on - shell .",
    "3 .   the interactions producing such heavy modes ( whether on - shell or virtual ) are now localized at specific moments in time , giving rise to effective interaction boundary terms .",
    "because there are no distinct features in the power spectrum , any visible new physics will probably need to be found in higher order correlations .",
    "the bispectrum , or 3-point correlation @xcite , for this example model will vanish to leading order in slow - roll , but more general models should have the effects of inflaton self - interactions and modified vacua multiplying @xcite .",
    "our results justify the conjecture made in @xcite that effective actions and modified vacua are expected in tandem .",
    "one distinct hope is that the bispectrum may be oscillatory .    for the trispectrum , or 4-point correlation @xcite ,",
    "little has been done in the way of categorizing such correlations and we can not give a complete analysis here , but let us summarize a few basic ideas .",
    "our model has leading - order trispectrum terms of types @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "these include the characteristic oscillations which are now squared , and would display high - energy signatures even if the oscillation frequency @xmath230 were too small to be observed by the power spectrum .    looking towards complete understanding , further details of the cutoff procedure ,",
