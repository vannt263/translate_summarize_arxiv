    "the dynamic of a small quantum system interacting weakly with uncontrollable degrees of freedom is well understood when a markovian approximation applies . in this situation , after tracing - out the environment , the system density matrix evolution can be well approximated by a lindblad equation @xcite .    besides that the applicability of the markovian approximation range over many areas of physics @xcite there exist several real systems whose dynamics present strong departures from it .",
    "the main signature of this departure is the presence of strong non - exponential decay behaviors , such as power law and stretched exponential .",
    "some examples are nanocrystal quantum dots under laser radiation schlegel , brokmann , grigolini , superconducting qubits makhlinreport , makhlin , falci , spin environments @xcite , dephasing in atomic and molecular physics @xcite , electron transfer and exciton dynamics in proteins @xcite , and molecular systems maintained in a glassy environment @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "these and another specific experimental situations rise up the necessity of finding formalism and effective evolutions able to describe the corresponding non - markovian dynamics .    when the environment is modeled as an infinite set of normal modes , departure from a markov approximation can be related to the corresponding spectral density function .",
    "this situation was extensively studied for the spin - boson and boson - boson models , where exacts solutions are available leggett , grifoni , lang , hanggi , milena .",
    "exact solutions can also be formulated for more general systems .",
    "nevertheless , due to the huge analytical and numerical efforts needed for getting the non - markovian system dynamics , alternative numerical methods based in a special decomposition of the spectral density function were formulated @xcite .",
    "anomalous system dynamics also arise from a random matrix modeling of the system - environment interaction @xcite .",
    "this approach naturally applies when describing environments characterized by a complex dynamics as for example chaotic ones .",
    "outside from a microscopic point of view , there exist an increasing interest in describing non - markovian effects in open quantum systems by introducing memory contributions in lindblad evolutions wilkie , budini , cresser , lidar .",
    "this procedure provide easy manageable dynamics .",
    "while most of these models are phenomenological , in this paper we will relate the presence of strong memory effects in the standard lindblad theory @xcite  with the microscopic interaction of a system with a complex structured environment .",
    "we will base our considerations in a splitting of the full hilbert space of the bath in a direct sum of sub - reservoirs , constructed in such a way that each one guarantees the conditions for the applicability of a markov approximation .",
    "our motivation for formulating this splitting comes from systems embedded in glassy environments , where the underlying disorder produce localized bath states , inducing a natural shell structure of modes , each set having a different coupling strength with the system @xcite .",
    "thus , we associate a different markovian sub - bath to each set of states .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the splitting assumption allows us to generalize the usual born - markov approximation , which in a natural way leads to the formulation of lindblad equations characterized by a random dissipative rate . as is well known from a classical context , master equations with random rates @xcite are useful for describing strong non - markovian effects @xcite . here",
    "we will demonstrate that the same scheme can also be applied in a quantum context under the previous conditions , i.e. , a complex environment under the splitting condition .",
    "as an example , we will study the anomalous dissipative dynamics of a quantum tunneling system described in a two level approximation @xcite .",
    "strong non - exponential behaviors , such as stretched exponential and power law , arise from the interplay between the unitary hopping dynamics and the memory effects induced by the environment . the conditions under which our modeling can be mapped to the spin - boson model and stochastic dynamics are established . in this context , the differences between our framework and other approaches @xcite introduced to deal with non - markovian environments are established .",
    "in general , the evolution of a system interacting with a complex environment can not be described in a markovian approximation . while a general treatment is clearly not possible , when the splitting condition applies , for weak system - bath interactions , the reduced dynamics can be described through a generalization of the born - markov approximation .",
