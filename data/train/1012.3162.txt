    "<S> we study the thermal distribution of intervalley phonons in a graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> these phonons have two components with the same frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of the two modes is preserved by weak electron - phonon coupling . a sufficiently strong electron - phonon coupling , however , can result in a splitting into an optical and an acoustic phonon branch , which creates a fluctuating gap in the electronic spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we describe these effects by treating the phonon distribution within a saddle - point approximation . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations around the saddle point indicate a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition of the acoustic branch </S>",
    "<S> . this transition might be observable in the polarization of raman scattered light .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene , a two - dimensional sheet of carbon atoms forming a honeycomb lattice , has highly unusual electronic properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that there are two bands that touch each other at two dirac nodes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the low - energy quasiparticles of undoped graphene experience a linear dispersion around the dirac nodes . </S>",
    "<S> transport properties , characterized by the longitudinal conductivity at the dirac nodes , are quite robust and do not vary much from sample to sample . exactly at the dirac point a minimal dc conductivity has been observed in a number of experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its value is not much affected by disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a typical source of disorder in graphene are frozen lattice deformations ( ripples ) @xcite . in a more realistic description , these deformations may not be frozen but fluctuate thermally due to the softness of the two - dimensional material .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate effects of the electron  </S>",
    "<S> phonon interaction in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> considering only in - plane displacements of graphene atoms , we have four different phonon modes . for low - energy electronic states electron  </S>",
    "<S> phonon interaction is efficient if the phonon wavevector is close to @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 points . </S>",
    "<S> as it was explained by basko and aleiner @xcite , the only modes which are effectively coupled to electrons are the pseudovector optical phonons corresponding to the irreducible representation @xmath3 of the group @xmath4 from the @xmath0 point , and the scalar phonons corresponding to the irreducible representations @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the same group from the points @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental information on the interaction is obtained by raman spectroscopy @xcite and by angle  resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above mentioned theoretical analysis of the role of different phonons is confirmed by the fact that in the raman spectrum of graphene only two two  phonon peaks are seen : the @xmath7 peak and the @xmath8 peak , corresponding to scalar and pseudovector phonons , respectively . in our paper </S>",
    "<S> we will consider interaction of electrons only with the scalar phonons .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics of the electron - phonon system is defined by the hamiltonian with optical ( einstein ) phonons at frequency @xmath9 @xcite : h= _ 0 _ * r * b_*r*^b_*r * + _ * r*,*r*[h_*r*,*r* + ( b_*r*,*r*+b^_*r*,*r* ) ] c^_*r * c_*r*  . </S>",
    "<S> [ hamilton00 ] here @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the electron creation ( annihilation ) operators and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the phonon creation ( annihilation ) operators . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian describes an effective attraction between the fermions and a renormalization of the electronic hopping amplitude @xmath14 , reducing the hopping rate substantially ( polaron effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive interaction may lead to the formation of cooper pairs . in 2d </S>",
    "<S> this effect is not relevant due to strong fluctuations , preventing the system to become superconducting .    </S>",
    "<S> the conventional approach to determine the properties of the phonons and the electrons is based on a self - consistent evaluation of the self energy ( migdal approximation ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter provides an effective ( or renormalized ) energy and its imaginary part an effective scattering rate </S>",
    "<S> . such a static approximation might be insufficient in a two - dimensional system , since it does not take into account thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this was already discussed in an experimental study of graphene @xcite . to avoid this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we include thermal fluctuations in our approach . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we replace the phonon operators @xmath13 , @xmath12 by their quantum average : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this approximation </S>",
    "<S> we can keep thermal fluctuations but ignore quantum fluctuations of the phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons , on the other hand , are studied in full quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the grand - canonical ensemble at inverse temperature @xmath17 , defined by the generating function @xmath18 to a functional integral with respect to thermal fluctuations of the lattice distortations @xmath19 and a trace with respect to the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noticed that only the real part @xmath20 couples to the electrons . after performing the trace over the electrons we get tr e^-h ( * 1*+e^-h)e^-s_0 d[u]z  . </S>",
    "<S> [ genfunc1 ] with the dispersion for the rescaled phonon field @xmath21 @xmath22 it is convenient to introduce a sublattice representation for the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath23 and to expand it around the two valleys @xmath1 and @xmath2 : the graphene unit cell contains two atoms , each of them has one @xmath24-orbital . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a two - component wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the bandstructure has two nodes ( or valleys ) . </S>",
    "<S> expansion around the valleys leads to a wavefunction that is represented by a 4-component column vector . </S>",
    "<S> we shall work in a direct product vector space of the valley space and the sublattice space . </S>",
    "<S> for the phonons we consider here only the intervalley contribution , which play a major role in the electron - phonon interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives for the low - energy hamiltonian h =- it _ </S>",
    "<S> 3+u_0  . </S>",
    "<S> [ hamiltonian0 ] the parameter @xmath25 is the bandwidth . here </S>",
    "<S> we have used a coordinate system that refers to one sublattice and one valley in the notation of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : the indices of the pauli matrices @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are acting on the a - b sublattices and the indices of the pauli matrices ( @xmath28 ( @xmath27 ) are acting on the two valleys @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a lattice difference operator . for graphene in a homogeneous magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> this electron - phonon interaction was considered in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the intervalley phonon field has two component : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .    the integral @xmath34 in eq . ( [ genfunc1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> serves as a generating function that allows us to get , for instance , the static electronic green s by differentiation of @xmath35 as g_*r*,*r*=(*1*+e^-h)^-1_*r*,*r* e^-sd[u ] [ fint ] with s = s_0-^-1(*1*+e^-h ) ,   u=(u_1,u_2 )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ action0 ] it is useful to notice that @xmath36 is a non - negative function . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath37 is a probability density for the phonon field , and the static one - particle green s function then can also be written as an average @xmath38 with respect to the distribution @xmath37 @xcite : g_*r*,*r*=(*1*+e^-h)^-1_*r*,*r* _ ph  . </S>",
    "<S> [ average_green ]    the distribution @xmath37 is invariant under a unitary transformation . for the special transformation </S>",
    "<S> hu h u^ ,  u=_0 [ usymmetry ] with @xmath39 the electron - phonon coupling term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamiltonian0 ] ) satisfies the relation uuu^=ou  , [ orthogonal ] where @xmath40 is the orthogonal transformation ( i.e. rotation by angle @xmath41 ) in the space of the matrices @xmath42 : @xmath43 since the gradient part of the hamiltonian @xmath23 is invariant under a global rotation of the phonon field @xmath44 , the distribution @xmath37 is also invariant . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the phonon field can produce massless fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> second order perturbation theory is the standard approach for evaluating the change of the phonon frequency by the electron - phonon interaction @xcite . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> defined by the action ( [ action0 ] ) , second order in @xmath45 gives us for the renormalized frequency of the intervalley mode ^2|_u=0 = ( _ 0-a_2)_ij [ pert_theory ] with a_2=  , [ coefficient ] where @xmath46 is the momentum cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath47 , which is satisfied even at room temperature due to @xmath48 ev , the renormalized phonon frequency has the asymptotic behavior @xmath49 thus the intervalley phonons are softened by the electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the phonons hardens as we go away from the dirac point @xmath50 , in agreement with recent experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this frequency becomes negative if @xmath51 , indicating an instability of the electron - phonon system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the vanishing frequency reveals a phonon softening , where the optical phonon mode becomes acoustic . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall discuss that this instability is associated with a splitting of the degenerate phonon modes , where instead of a single phonon frequency two different frequencies appear .    </S>",
    "<S> the instability can not be treated within second - order perturbation theory but requires a self - consistent approach . </S>",
    "<S> here it is natural to perform the integration in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ genfunc1 ] ) and ( [ fint ] ) in a saddle - point ( sp ) approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the sp equation @xmath52 which determines an average lattice distortion @xmath53 . assuming a uniform solution @xmath54 the sp equation @xmath55 reads = 2 [ spa1 ] with the dispersion @xmath56 of the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero @xmath54 opens an electronic gap @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation fixes only @xmath54 , not the direction of the vector @xmath58 . for a non - trivial solution @xmath59 we we can perform the integration in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spa1 ] ) and obtain the equation = e^t^2_0/^2  . [ spe1 ] </S>",
    "<S> then the critical point @xmath60 of the instability is determined from this equation for @xmath61 .    for @xmath47 and @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> we get from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spe1 ] ) ~(1- ) [ order_p1 ] and for @xmath47 , @xmath63 ~  . </S>",
    "<S> [ order_p2 ] while an increase of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath45 increases @xmath54 for @xmath62 , it decreases @xmath54 for @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the instability of the @xmath61 solution is supported by the electron - phonon interaction near the dirac point , whereas the instability is suppressed further away from the dirac point .    for small @xmath54 eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spe1 ] ) can be expanded . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study the properties of the phonon renormalization for nonzero @xmath54 , i.e. in the regime where @xmath61 and the perturbation theory are unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the sp equation then reads ^2|_u=|u ( -a_2 + a_4 |u^2)|u_j = 0  . </S>",
    "<S> [ spe2 ] besides the solution @xmath61 this equation has the nonzero solutions @xmath64 with ^2|_u=|u = 4(a_2-_0 ) [ curve2 ] instead of ( [ pert_theory ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the sp solution @xmath65 is on a circle with radius @xmath54 , the eigenvalues of the matrix on the right - hand side are @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for a stable solution , on the other hand , @xmath61 the frequency shift agrees with the result of the second - order perturbation theory . combining ( [ pert_theory ] ) ( for @xmath68 ) and ( [ curve2 ] ) ( for @xmath69 ) , we obtain the renormalized phonon frequencies as _ 1 |a_2-_0|[ren_frequency1 ]  , _ </S>",
    "<S> 2(_0-a_2)(_0-a_2 )   . </S>",
    "<S> [ ren_frequency2 ] thus , the mode with @xmath70 vanishes for the solution @xmath71 , as plotted in fig . [ fig : splitting ] .    , ( [ ren_frequency2 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the red ( blue ) curve represents @xmath72 ( @xmath70 ) in units of @xmath9 , indicating that for the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling @xmath73 there exist two different frequencies.,width=302,height=226 ]    after having solved the sp equation for a uniform phonon field @xmath44 , we study the fluctuations around the uniform solution . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations may play an important role and should modify the uniform solution due to the two - dimensionality of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the fluctuations are crucial for the vanishing phonon frequency @xmath70 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ren_frequency2 ] ) .    with the special sp solution @xmath65 also any rotated phonon mode </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 is a sp solution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can choose the special solution @xmath75 and , using the identity ( [ orthogonal ] ) , obtain the action at the sp as @xmath76 % = s_0-\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\log\\left[\\det({\\bf 1}+e^{-\\beta(-iu^\\dagger\\slashed{\\partial}u+{\\bar u}\\lambda_1)})\\right ] \\ , \\ ] ] which is degenerated with respect to a global unitary transformation @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> in order to study fluctuations around the sp solution we introduce a spatially fluctuating unitary matrix @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be cast into a nonlinear matrix field _ </S>",
    "<S> * r*= u_*r*_1u_*r*^=_0  , [ matrixfield ] such that the action becomes ss_0-  . [ effaction ] this action can be expanded , either for @xmath79 or for @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we assume that @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> formally , @xmath25 can be chosen independently of the real bandwidth of the system . but </S>",
    "<S> this choice means that the physics is restricted to quasiparticles up to energy @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> then the expansion of the action @xmath82 of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ effaction ] ) in powers of @xmath83 provides a @xmath84 nonlinear sigma model : ss_0 + f ( , |u ) tr ( ) [ action2 ] with the prefactor f(,|u ) =  . </S>",
    "<S> [ prefactor ] using the result of @xmath54 for @xmath85 , the @xmath17 dependence drops out of the prefactor : f~ ~  . </S>",
    "<S> [ prefactor1 ] this result can be considered as a renormalization effect for the temperature , where the renormalized dimensionless temperature reads = t ~(1- ) t  . </S>",
    "<S> [ ren_temp1 ] here we have assumed @xmath62 and have used the expression of @xmath54 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ order_p1 ] ) . as the electron - phonon coupling @xmath45 increases , the renormalized temperature @xmath86 increases as well . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the fact that the electronic fluctuations enhance the phonon fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath63 is rather unrealistic here , since we also have assumed @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuating term in eq . ( [ action2 ] ) represents an xy model for the angular fluctuations @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the phonon fluctuations undergo a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition if @xmath88 is of order one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for temperatures below the bkt transition point @xmath88 the fluctuations are strongly correlated whereas above this temperature the correlations of the fluctuations decay exponentially due to the proliferation of vortex pairs .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from our calculation that second - order perturbation theory with respect to electron - phonon interaction reveals a phonon softening . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with other calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently large electron - phonon coupling the perturbative approach breaks down and a self - consistent calculation is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> we have used an sp approximation for the phonon fluctuations and found an instability of the perturbative approach due to a splitting of the optical phonon mode into an optical and an acoustic branch . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is related to a massless mode caused by the rotational symmetry of the two system . </S>",
    "<S> it is characterized by long - ranged correlations of the phonon fluctuations , in contrast to the short - range fluctuations of the optical phonons . however , at sufficiently high temperatures these long - range correlations can undergo a bkt transition by the creation of vortex pairs , resulting again in short - range correlated fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the average lattice distortion vanishes for all regimes as a consequence of the mermin - wagner argument . a possible way to observe </S>",
    "<S> the bkt transition experimentally is to measure the polarization in raman scattering , since the photon polarization couples to the direction of the lattice distortions .    </S>",
    "<S> the instability of the intervalley phonons is very different from the instability of the holstein ( out - of - plane ) phonons studied recently , where the phonons undergo an ising transition @xcite . in the latter case only short - range </S>",
    "<S> correlated fluctuations appear ( except for the critical point ) but the average distortion has a non - zero value .    to understand the effect of the thermal phonon fluctuations on the electronic transport properties , we can return to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ average_green ] ) . then @xmath89 produces a random gap in the electronic spectrum which has to be averaged with respect to the phonon distribution @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the effect of thermal phonons is similar to the effect of frozen correlated disorder , depending on the temperature of the sample though . </S>",
    "<S> since an uncorrelated random gap with vanishing mean does not affect the minimal conductivity @xcite , we expect a similar result for thermally fluctuating intervalley phonons , at least near the dirac point .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , our calculation reveals that the electron - phonon interaction in graphene leads to a substantial renormalization of the intervalley phonons . for sufficiently strong electron - phonon coupling </S>",
    "<S> this causes an instability , where the phonon frequency vanishes and a new pair of phonons appears , consisting of an optical and an acoustic branch . </S>"
