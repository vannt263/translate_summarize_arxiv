    "in recent years , a great deal of work has been devoted to the study of two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "two - dimensional turbulence is not only relevant to the study of geophysical and astrophysical flows , but it is also far more accessible to modern computers and experiments , since the measurement and the visualization of the velocity and vorticity fields are much easier than in @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , two - dimensional turbulence has deep connections with other fields of physics such as electron plasmas in magnetic field @xcite and stellar dynamics @xcite",
    ".    for the specific problem of two - dimensional decaying turbulence , recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works have emphasized the importance of coherent vortex dynamics during the fluid decay .",
    "this process essentially consists in three stages : during an initial transient period , the fluid self - organizes and a network of coherent vortices appears .",
    "once the coherent vortices have emerged , vortices disappear through mergings of like - sign vortices , such that their number @xmath9 decreases and their average radius @xmath10 increases , in a process somewhat reminiscent of a coarsening dynamics @xcite . during this process , and in the limit of small viscosity , energy remains constant .",
    "when only one dipole ( or very few ) remains , it finally decays diffusively .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the `` coarsening '' stage is certainly the most interesting as , in principle , it can extend on an arbitrary long time period . in this regime , the main question arising concerns the existence of universal features including the decay exponent @xmath11 ( @xmath1 ) , and other exponents which describe the time evolution of quantities such as the average vortex radius , the enstrophy or the kurtosis .    in this paper",
    ", we first describe an effective model for the vortex dynamics and review the main experimental and numerical results concerning the temporal evolution of the physical quantities listed above . in section * ii * , we show that the surviving vortices have a hyperdiffusive motion with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath12 , and a flight time distribution behaving as @xmath13 .",
    "we then consider a `` nave '' kinetic theory for the vortex decay dynamics predicting @xmath3 . in section",
    "* iii * , we introduce a numerical renormalization group ( rg ) procedure which permits very long simulation times . although the numerical diffusion coefficient is well described by the preceding kinetic theory , the decay exponent is found to be significantly lower than expected ( @xmath2 instead of @xmath3 ) . in section * iv * , we derive an effective dynamics for 2 and for 3 neighboring vortices subjected to the effective noise due to far away vortices . within these simple models ,",
    "we relate the average merging time to the decay exponent @xmath11 found in the rg simulations .",
    "our main conclusion is that the lower than expected value for @xmath11 could be explained by the fact that two - body collisions are irrelevant at large time , whereas three - body collisions predominate . in section * v * , we present a simple kinetic theory taking these three - body collisions into account and yielding @xmath6 . the importance of three - body collisions in vortex dynamics was previously pointed out by novikov @xcite , in a different context . throughout this paper ,",
    "we compare our results to recent experiments @xcite and find a very good overall agreement .",
    "as we are mainly concerned with the coherent vortex dynamics and merging processes , it is natural to focus on the effective behavior of the sole vortices , neglecting the incoherent background .",
    "the route to such an effective model starts with the work of kirchhoff @xcite who obtained the equations of motion of point - like vortices in the zero viscosity limit .",
    "vortices follow a hamiltonian dynamics where the vortex center coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 are conjugate variables : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the circulation of vortex @xmath18 , and where @xmath19 denotes the following hamiltonian : @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the distance between vortices @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "these equations of motion can be more explicitly written : @xmath23 these equations are strictly valid for point - like vortices and can not describe vortex mergings .",
    "this should be accounted by hand by defining _",
    "ad hoc _ merging rules as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite determined a criterion for the merging of two like - sign vortices of radii @xmath24 and @xmath25 , within the elliptical - moment model @xcite .",
    "they found that , for @xmath26 , collapse can be observed for an initial vortex separation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are numerical constant of order 1 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite ) . using @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one easily obtains @xmath34 which shows that @xmath35 is of the order of the mean radius . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors in fact used @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "thus , if one considers a collection of vortices of the same typical size , it is clear that choosing the same critical distance for all mergings , equal to the average radius @xmath10 of the population of vortices , can not drastically affect the model properties .",
    "this was actually verified in @xcite . now that the merging criterion has been given , the properties of the vortex resulting from the merging of two like - sign vortices must be specified .",
    "motivated by experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite , the authors of @xcite and @xcite assumed that the average peak vorticity @xmath38 is conserved throughout the merging process , as well as the energy since the inviscid limit is considered . as the total energy scales as @xmath39 ( with a possible @xmath40 correction )",
    ", this shows that @xmath41 should be conserved , or equivalently that a vortex of radius @xmath42 results from the merging of two vortices of radii @xmath24 and @xmath25 . note that this conservation law is consistent with the observed slow enstrophy dissipation @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of this model starting from a population of vortices having the same typical radius results in a narrow radius distribution at all subsequent times @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is observed that the number of vortices decays as a power law @xmath43 with @xmath44 , much smaller than the exponent predicted by batchelor theory ( @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "the conservation of the total energy and mean peak vorticity leads to the occurrence of only one independent exponent for the time evolution of physical quantities @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the typical distance between vortices , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively the enstrophy and the kurtosis .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 and the predicted scaling laws are consistent with experiments @xcite and direct numerical simulations @xcite of navier - stokes ( ns ) equation ( using a hyperviscous dissipation term ) .",
    "the kirchhoff simulations and actual experiments cited above were only carried out for very short time . in @xcite ( as well as in experiments",
    "@xcite ) , the number of vortices decays by less than a factor 4 at the maximal accessible time @xmath50 .",
    "raw data show significant curvature on a log - log plot , hence the introduction of an extra fitting parameter @xmath51 in @xcite ( see ) .",
    "since @xmath52 , the simulation time is of the order of the transient time @xmath51 , and the scaling regime for @xmath53 is probably not reached . as a matter of fact , the actual exponent @xmath11 obtained by measuring the logarithmic slope at the final time is of order @xmath54 , as obtained by benzi and co - workers @xcite ( see also section * iii.b * )    it would be interesting to explore the domain of lower vortex density @xmath55 , as in all simulations performed so far the mean free path ( of the order of the typical distance between vortices @xcite ) remains of the same order as the radius size . in other words , the fraction of area occupied by the vortices , @xmath56 remains quite large in the early time of the dynamics . because of the scaling laws of",
    ", @xmath47 grows faster than the mean radius @xmath10 , such that vortices become effectively more and more point - like , a regime which seems to be out of numerical reach , and which should develop for @xmath53 .        in the absence of mergings ,",
    "the chaotic kirchhoff dynamics is known to lead to an effective diffusive motion of the vortices @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient can be calculated by computing the fluctuation time @xmath57 for a given vortex velocity @xmath58 and averaging the quantity @xmath59 over the velocity distribution .",
    "this calculation has been extensively described in @xcite and we present here a simple heuristic argument leading more directly to the same result .    using and , the average velocity squared is @xmath60 where we have neglected the contribution of off - diagonal terms obtained when squaring and .",
    "if we assume the vortices to be uniformly distributed on average , and the circulations to be equal up to their sign , we then obtain @xmath61 where we have introduced the vortex typical radius @xmath10 as a natural cut - off .",
    "this expression already obtained in @xcite has been qualitatively checked in @xcite and is confirmed by our simulations of section * iii.b*.    it is then natural to assume that the mean free path @xmath62 is of order @xmath47 , the typical distance between vortices , as proved in @xcite .",
    "we then get the expressions for the mean free time @xmath63 and the diffusion coefficient : @xmath64 in agreement with our more sophisticated treatment @xcite .    now",
    ", if we include merging events , these different quantities are expected to vary with time as both the density @xmath55 and the typical circulation @xmath65 do .",
    "if we drop logarithmic corrections for now , we obtain @xmath66 note that this expression for the diffusion coefficient @xmath67 differs from that obtained in @xcite ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "indeed , the authors of @xcite used the merging time @xmath69 to compute @xmath67 , instead of the fluctuation or mean free time which is relevant here @xcite .",
    "a nave estimate of this merging time is addressed in the next subsection .",
    "finally , we predict that the mean square displacement of surviving vortices ( or test particles ) in the decaying fluid should behave as @xcite @xmath70 in @xcite , the authors found @xmath71 , which leads to @xmath72 , using .",
    "this must be compared with the experimental value @xmath73 for vortices and @xmath74 for test particles moving along the current lines of the fluid .",
    "is also in good agreement with our simulations of section * iii.b*.    note that this hyperdiffusive behavior can be interpreted by invoking a power - law decreasing flight time distribution ( time between two deflections or large velocity fluctuations ) .",
    "let us assume that this distribution behaves as @xmath75 with @xmath76 , such that the average fluctuation time exists .",
    "then , after a time @xmath77 ( @xmath78 deflections ) , and using that @xmath79 is essentially constant , the mean square displacement reads @xmath80 this shows that within this interpretation @xmath81 , or @xmath82 using @xmath71 , we find @xmath83 , in good agreement with the experimental value @xmath84 measured in @xcite .",
    "the merging time @xmath69 is the typical time between two merging events involving the same vortex .",
    "if we assume that vortex mergings occur whenever two like - sign vortices stand at a distance less than @xmath85 , a classical cross - section argument leads to @xmath86 if we assume a scaling regime where @xmath87 decays as a power law , @xmath88 must behave linearly with time @xcite as @xmath89 using the scaling equations and , and the above expression for @xmath69 , we finally obtain @xmath90 neglecting logarithmic corrections in @xmath58 . the constraint",
    "@xmath91 then leads to @xmath3 , well above the measured value @xmath71 .",
    "note that our argument is fully consistent with a direct simulation performed by trizac @xcite , who found @xmath71 , in a balistic system obeying the same conservation laws as in the vortex model , but for which the typical velocity decreases as @xmath92 instead of being constant .",
    "using , we indeed predict a decay exponent @xmath93 , in perfect agreement with the observed decay exponent .",
    "note that the similarity with the value of the decay exponent observed in vortex dynamics is then purely incidental .    in the experiment @xcite",
    ", the authors obtained @xmath94 , which strongly indicates that they had not yet reached the scaling regime , which is not too surprising as the experiment was performed on less than a time decade .",
    "as mentioned in section * ii.b * , this should raise some doubts about the validity of the apparent exponent @xmath71 .",
    "in this section , we address the problem of performing long - time simulations allowing for low vortex density _ and _ total vortex area coverage .",
    "direct simulations of kirchhoff equations are doomed to failure since each evaluation of a vortex velocity involves the sum over @xmath9 terms ( see and ) .",
    "to access very low densities , one must therefore start out with a very large initial number of vortices , which results in a very slow early dynamics .",
    "the idea of the new approach that we introduce in this section , is to work with a _ constant _ number of vortices in a reasonable range ( @xmath95 ) , and progressively increase the domain size @xmath96 by a procedure detailed below . for simplicity , we work with vortices of identical radii at all times and thus of equal circulation up to a sign .",
    "this is probably a reasonable approximation , as previous short - time simulations and experiments have shown that the radius and circulation distributions remain narrow at all times @xcite .",
    "therefore , the universal features of the dynamics are expected to survive . moreover , keeping such constant distributions in time should minimize transient time effects due to the fact that the scaling distributions are not yet reached ( although this problem is partly taken into account by the clever procedure introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "we thus consider @xmath9 vortices of radius @xmath10 and circulation @xmath97 ( @xmath98 vortices of each sign ) in a box of initial linear size @xmath96 , such that the initial density is @xmath99 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are considered and kirchhoff equations of motion are adapted to this situation @xcite . compared to and , the velocity induced by a vortex @xmath22 on a vortex @xmath18 is only significantly different for vortices at a distance of order @xmath96 , so that the physics is not modified particularly for vortices at a typical distance @xmath100 or less .",
    "vortices do obey kirchhoff dynamics until two like - sign vortices meet , _",
    "i.e. _ their distance is less than @xmath101 ( see the discussion of section * ii.a * ) .",
    "both vortices are merged , and all radii and circulations are updated to @xmath102 the density is updated accordingly : @xmath103 a new vortex of the same sign as the vortex which just disappeared is then introduced in the box at a random position and has radius @xmath104 and circulation @xmath105 . the number of vortices in the box is then restored to its initial value @xmath9 .",
    "all the distances are then scaled by a factor @xmath106 : @xmath107 this renormalization procedure ensures that the new density takes the correct value @xmath108 and that the quantity @xmath109 is conserved , ensuring the conservation of the energy per area unit . if @xmath9 is large enough , one may expect that the introduction of a new uncorrelated vortex after each merging should not affect the dynamics , especially at large times for which the merging time is much larger than the mean free time .",
    "in this regime , the newly introduced vortex which has only a probability @xmath110 of being involved in the next collision has plenty of time to get `` randomized '' as @xmath111 .",
    "we have performed long - time rg simulations with @xmath112 vortices , reaching final densities as low as @xmath113 . except for the case",
    "@xmath114 which seems to decay faster , the different density plots are essentially independent from the actual number of vortices involved in the rg ( see fig .",
    "the long - time decay exponent is estimated to be @xmath115 significantly higher than the expected value @xmath71 but still well below the nave estimate @xmath3 obtained in section * ii.c*.    we have also measured the average mean square displacement of surviving vortices .",
    "the motion is found to be hyperdiffusive with a diffusion exponent @xmath116 consistent with the prediction of section * ii.c * and @xcite .",
    "indeed , we find @xmath117 , to be compared with @xmath118 , admitting the value @xmath6 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . note that according to section * ii.c.*_2 _ , we thus predict a flight time distribution behaving as @xmath119 , for large @xmath63 .    in the range @xmath120 , corresponding to the range of density obtained in previous experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite",
    ", we indeed obtain an apparent exponent of order @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "3 , we compare the direct simulations of @xcite where vortices were allowed to develop a scaling radius distribution . after fitting an arbitrary time scale , it appears that our rg simulations are in good agreement with these previous works , although our rg simulations extend to almost three more decades in time .",
    "we have also measured the mean square vortex velocity which is expected to behave as @xmath121 this behavior is confirmed by our rg numerical simulations as shown in fig .",
    "we have also performed rg simulations introducing a distance cut - off in kirchhoff equations and , replacing @xmath122 by @xmath123 . indeed , although like - sign vortices can not approach each other closer than a distance @xmath124 ( otherwise they merge ) , opposite - sign vortices can , which is quite unphysical as it generates very fast traveling dipoles . introducing this cut - off results in a physical upper cut - off of order @xmath125 for the maximum velocity of these dipoles .",
    "the number of vortices initially decays slightly more slowly , although the long - time decay exponent remains fully compatible with @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to new direct simulations where the radii and modulus of circulation are maintained equal for all surviving vortices . even starting from @xmath126 , it is hard to reach low densities in a reliable way . as exemplified in fig .",
    "5 , these direct simulations follow our rg calculations before decaying faster beyond a breaking time @xmath127 , as the density approaches the minimum reachable density @xmath128 . we observe that the breakdown occurs sooner for samples with a decreasing initial number of vortices .",
    "@xmath127 is in fact of the order of the minimum time after which some samples had reached the minimum possible density ( only 2 opposite vortices left ) .",
    "still , fig .",
    "5 lends credence to the claim that the large @xmath9 limit finally reproduces the rg results .",
    "note finally that for these direct simulations , the actual logarithmic correction in the mean square velocity behaves differently from that in the rg simulations as the box size @xmath96 remains constant . in this case , it slowly decreases as @xmath129 up to a time of order @xmath130 .",
    "note that this subdominant difference between rg and direct simulations could be responsible for a slight discrepancy in the apparent decay exponent observed in both kinds of simulations .",
    "in this section , we are concerned with an alternative way of evaluating the merging time @xmath69 as a function of the physical parameters @xmath55 , @xmath10 , @xmath65 ... on the basis of simple dimensional analysis , @xmath88 can be expected to be proportional to the mean free time @xmath63 multiplied by an arbitrary function of the only dimensionless parameter @xmath131 .",
    "expecting power - law behaviors for these quantities , a natural _ ansatz _ is @xmath132 where @xmath133 is an exponent to be determined . dropping logarithmic corrections in @xmath63 ( see ) , we obtain @xmath134 imposing that @xmath69 must be proportional to the actual time ( see section * ii.c * ) , and using the scaling equations",
    ", we find the relation between the decay exponent @xmath11 and @xmath133 : @xmath135 note that the nave expression of @xmath69 obtained in section * ii.c * can also be written in this form : @xmath136 corresponding to @xmath137 and thus @xmath3 .",
    "we now consider the effective dynamics of two _ nearby _ like - sign vortices , assuming that the @xmath138 other vortices are at a distance _ at least of order",
    "_ @xmath47 .",
    "the velocity induced by the other vortices on one of these two vortices can be written as the sum of the velocity induced on the center of mass ( at @xmath139 ) plus a small correction : @xmath140 where we have neglected other corrections involving higher powers of @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "after a straightforward calculation , we get a similar equation for @xmath143 : @xmath144 note the antisymmetric structure of and resulting from the hamiltonian nature of the dynamics .",
    "we will now assume that @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 can be considered as random gaussian variables .",
    "their second moments are respectively @xmath149 up to a logarithmic term ( see section * ii.c * and @xcite ) , and @xmath150 we have used @xmath47 as the lower cut - off since the other vortices were assumed to be at a distance at least of order @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath151 have the dimension of an inverse time and are simply of order @xmath152 .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath151 have the same correlation time as the velocity , namely the mean free time @xmath63 .",
    "assuming that @xmath153 and @xmath151 are gaussian noises of correlation time @xmath63 leads us to write a simplified effective langevin equation describing the dynamics of these four quantities : @xmath154 where @xmath155 , and @xmath156 are independent @xmath157-correlated white noises .",
    "such a langevin equation was recently introduced to describe velocity fluctuations in @xcite , with reasonable success .",
    "we are now ready to construct an effective two - body system in order to study the merging time .",
    "we consider two like - sign vortices of identical circulation in a square box of size @xmath47 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these vortices are submitted to their mutual advection and to the effective noise induced by the other vortices at a distance greater than @xmath47 .",
    "if we define @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , we get from kirchhoff equations and and @xmath161 as the average induced velocity cancels out . after expressing time in units of @xmath63 ( @xmath162 and distance in units of @xmath47 ( @xmath163 , @xmath164 ) , and noting that @xmath165 , we end up with a dimensionless equation of motion as anticipated in the previous subsection : @xmath166 where @xmath167 are independent langevin random variables , of unit mean square average and correlation time .",
    "both vortices are initially randomly placed in the unit box at a mutual distance @xmath168 and their relative distance evolves according to and until @xmath169 becomes smaller than the scaled dimensionless parameter @xmath170 , which defines the merging time . as anticipated above",
    ", the average merging time in units of @xmath63 can only be a function of this parameter @xmath171 , leading to .",
    "numerical simulations of and lead to the following surprising result : both vortices remain at a relative distance greater than a constant @xmath172 which slightly depends on the actual numerical constants in and ( to simplify , we have assumed the coefficients of @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and the correlation time of @xmath151 to be exactly equal to 1 ) . a typical long - time trajectory is shown in fig . 6 and",
    "perfectly illustrates the absence of collisions when the vortex size is below a certain threshold .",
    "note that if there were no noise due to the other vortices , both vortices would strictly remain at the same distance , hence producing a circular trajectory .    of course , our result does not prove the absence of collision in the actual @xmath9-body system , but strongly suggests that the main assumption according to which all other vortices are at a distance greater than @xmath47 prevents both test vortices from colliding .",
    "let us now give a physical interpretation of our result . if both test vortices were at the same point , their distance would not vary since the velocity induced by the other vortices would be exactly the same for both vortices .",
    "thus , when they are close to each other , the effective induced noise is reduced linearly with their distance @xmath169 as shown by and .",
    "in addition , as vortices get closer to each other ( @xmath175 ) , their relative position describes a circle , moving at angular velocity of order @xmath176 because of this fast rotation , the effective fluctuation time of the noise , as seen in the moving frame , becomes @xmath177 instead of @xmath63 .",
    "hence , not only the driving noise is reduced due to the proximity of the test vortices , but it is also averaged out due to their fast rotation .",
    "such a short effective fluctuation time was in fact introduced in @xcite .",
    "another way of interprating the effect of the fast vortex rotation is to note that due to the large difference between the system natural frequency @xmath38 and that of the noise perturbation ( @xmath178 ) , the adiabatic theorem ensures that the effective perturbation is reduced by a factor of order @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is a constant of order unity @xcite .",
    "conversely , if both vortices start at a distance @xmath181 , this fast rotating pair remains stable for a very long time , probably infinite .",
    "such pairs can thus only be destroyed by the direct interaction with a third vortex , and not solely by the background noise .",
    "the results of this section suggest that strictly two - body interactions are not sufficient to generate collisions .",
    "it is thus natural to study the equivalent three - body problem , which is the subject of the next section .      using and",
    ", we can generalize our preceding approach to the case of three test vortices submitted to the effective noise induced by far away vortices .",
    "for the first vortex , the effective equation of motion now reads @xmath182 with similar equations for the two other test vortices . as we are studying the merging time of like - sign vortices , we take vortex 1 and 2 to be of circulation @xmath183 , whereas vortex 3 is left unspecified , with circulation @xmath184 .    as in the preceding section",
    ", these effective equations of motion can be rescaled by expressing distances in units of @xmath47 and times in units of @xmath63 . in these new units ,",
    "a collision between vortices 1 and 2 occurs when the distance between them is less than the scaled dimensionless parameter @xmath185 .",
    "the sign of the third vortex plays a significant role .",
    "when it is the same as that of the other two , a phenomenon reminiscent of that which was found for two - body collisions occurs : vortices do not collide below a certain radius , at least during numerically observable times .    on the contrary ,",
    "when this third vortex is of the opposite sign , we observe a smooth dependence of the merging time as a function of @xmath171 , which is fully compatible with the functional form ( see fig .",
    "7 ) @xmath186 that is @xmath187 , and thus @xmath6",
    "using the results of section * iv.a*. this result is in agreement with our rg calculation , for which we also found @xmath2 .",
    "note that for @xmath188 large , corresponding to the early stage of the actual dynamics , the apparent value of @xmath133 is of order @xmath189 , which is compatible with an apparent decay exponent in the range @xmath190 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "the present study strongly suggests that for small surface coverage ( @xmath191 ) , the relevant collision mechanism involves three vortices , one having an opposite circulation from the other two .",
    "a nave picture would be that of a @xmath192 dipole moving at the typical velocity @xmath125 encountering an isolated vortex of any sign .",
    "the importance of these fast traveling pairs was already suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the three - body collision processes need not to strictly occur in the simple way described above , although this does provide an evocative physical picture from which to construct an effective kinetic theory .",
    "following the interpretation presented above , the collision rate is @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the dipole density and typical velocity , and the last term is the probability per unit time for a dipole to collide with an isolated vortex . in a simple mean - field approach , dipoles of typical size @xmath10 are formed with density @xmath196 their velocity being of order @xmath197 .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath198 which corresponds to a merging time @xmath199 which in the language of section * ii.c * leads to @xmath187 , and then to @xmath6 ( up to logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "this simple interpretation reconciles the paradoxical observation that although vortices are _ hyperdiffusive _ ( see section * ii.c.*_1 _ and * iii.b * ) the observed decay exponent @xmath11 is _ lower _ than that found for diffusive aggregation @xcite ( see also section * ii.c.*_2 _ ) .",
    "the dynamics is slowed down by the requirement of three close vortices for an actual merging to occur , at least for small area coverage .",
    "note that using and energy conservation , we can also write @xmath200 this relation is particularly well obeyed in the experiment described in @xcite , lhs and rhs terms being respectively @xmath201 thus , although @xmath69 does not behave linearly with time in the experiment , which is probably due to the fact that the scaling regime was not reached , all the relations found between physical quantities ( @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 in section * ii.c * , and the above relation ) are fully consistent with our kinetic theory .    note that was obtained by pomeau @xcite and by one of us @xcite , but with the use of highly questionable physical arguments . in @xcite ,",
    "the kinetic equation was written in the form @xmath205 by arguing that after a time of order @xmath63 the collision probability is simply the geometrical overlapping probability @xmath131 , although a cross - section argument is definitely required ( see section * ii.c * ) .",
    "this argument boils down to the assumption that after a time @xmath63 , the vortex positions can be considered to be randomly generated , and collisions happen if two vortices overlap . in @xcite , inspired by the theory of diffusive aggregation @xcite , the kinetic equation was written in the form @xmath206 but with an incorrect expression for the diffusion coefficient @xmath67 ( found constant in @xcite ) . in @xcite , the fact that @xmath207 is essentially constant was correctly used , but the fluctuation time was taken as @xmath208 instead of @xmath63 . as we have seen in section * iv.c * , it happens that just before a collision , the effective fluctuation time in fact becomes equal to @xmath208 , which makes the agreement of with rather incidental .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a numerical rg procedure which permits very long - time simulations of the vortex kirchhoff dynamics in a two - dimensional decaying fluid .",
    "although we recover a short - time regime compatible with a decay exponent of order @xmath71 when the vortex surface coverage is still large and @xmath209 , we ultimately find a long - time asymptotic decay with @xmath2 .",
    "none of these results can be explained by the simple kinetic theory of section * ii.c * based on the occurrence of two - body collisions which predicts @xmath3 .",
    "the failure of this `` nave '' kinetic theory could be explained by our claim that strictly two - body collisions are irrelevant for small enough vortex surface coverage ( section * iv .",
    "c * ) . for collision processes involving two like - sign vortices and a third opposite - sign vortex",
    ", we found an average merging time @xmath210 , fully consistent with a decay exponent @xmath6 ( section * iv .",
    "a simple kinetic theory based on this collision mechanism also leads to @xmath6 and predicts that @xmath211 in agreement with the experiment described in @xcite . our prediction @xcite that the mean square displacement of surviving vortices goes as @xmath212 is in good agreement with our rg simulations and with experiments .",
    "moreover , the exponent describing the decay of the flight time distribution is related to @xmath11 by @xmath204 , in perfect agreement with experiment .",
    "our work has so far been limited to the study of the dynamics of a population of vortices _ having the same radii _ at all times . however , it is important to address the question of the possible dependence of the decay exponent @xmath11 on the form of the radius distribution and/or the initial conditions @xcite , in order to verify its possible universality .",
    "thus , it is a motivating challenge to generalize our rg approach to the case of a polydisperse assembly of vortices . a crucial point would be to correctly specify the radius of the new vortex reinjected after each merging event .",
    "this and the study of the effective three - body dynamics of different size / circulation vortices should be the subject of a future study @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to jane basson for useful comments on the manuscript , and to sidney redner and dima shepelyansky for fruitful discussions .",
    "we also thank brengre dubrulle for her interest in this work .",
