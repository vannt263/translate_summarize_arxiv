    "the standard model ( sm ) has been tested with good accuracy and it has been proved to be successful in the energy scale of the present colliders . however , it is generally believed that sm is embedded in a more fundamental theory ( new physics ) in which its effects can be observed at higher energy scales .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest fermion in the sm .",
    "its mass is at the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale . because of its large mass , the top quark and its couplings",
    "are expected to be more sensitive to new physics than other particles @xcite",
    ". therefore precision measurements of top quark couplings will be the crucial test of the structure of the sm .",
    "a deviation of the couplings from the expected values would indicate the existence of new physics beyond the sm .    in this work we analyzed anomalous @xmath1 and @xmath9 couplings in the single top production process @xmath10 .",
    "since the top quark is very heavy , its weak decay time is much shorter than the typical time for the strong interactions to affect its spin @xcite .",
    "therefore the information on its polarization is not disturbed by hadronization effects but transferred to the decay products .",
    "the angular distribution of the top quark decay involves correlations between top decay products and top quark spin :    @xmath11    here the dominant decay chain of the top quark in the standard model @xmath12 is considered .",
    "@xmath13 is the spin asymmetry and @xmath14 is defined as the angle between top quark decay products and the top quark spin quantization axis in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "@xmath15 is the correlation coefficient and @xmath16 for @xmath17 or @xmath18 , which leads to the strongest correlation .",
    "we take into account top quark spin polarization along the direction of various spin bases to improve the sensitivity limits .",
    "anomalous @xmath1 and @xmath9 couplings can be analyzed in a model independent way by means of the effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "we consider the following couplings , which are necessary for the process @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 + h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath21    in the sm , the ( v - a ) coupling @xmath22 corresponds to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath23 , which is very close to unity and @xmath24 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are equal to zero .",
    "the ( v+a ) coupling @xmath24 is severely bounded by the cleo @xmath25 data @xcite at a level such that it will be out of reach at expected future colliders .",
    "therefore we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 as required by present data @xcite .",
    "the magnetic type anomalous couplings are related to the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite in the general effective lagrangian by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the scale of new physics .",
    "natural values of the couplings @xmath32 are in the region @xcite of @xmath33 and do not exceed unitarity violation bounds for @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "there are many detailed discussions in the literature for @xmath1 couplings in the single and pair top quark production .",
    "the single top quark production cross section for the process @xmath35 has been discussed below and the above the @xmath36 threshold @xcite and for the process @xmath37 at cern lep2 @xcite and linear @xmath38 collider @xcite energies .",
    "pair top production processes for a future linear collider have been investigated in @xmath38 and @xmath39 collisions @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 couplings have also been investigated at fermilab tevatron and cern lhc @xcite . in @xmath40 collision ,",
    "the @xmath1 couplings were analyzed for polarized top quarks via the process @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that polarization leads to a significant improvement in the sensitivity limits . in the literature",
    "there have been several studies of anomalous @xmath1 couplings in @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "different from these studies we take into account top quark spin polarization along the direction of various spin bases to improve the sensitivity limits .",
    "research and development of linear @xmath38 colliders have been progressing and the physics potential of these future machines is under study . after linear colliders have been constructed their operating modes of @xmath0 and @xmath39 are expected to be designed @xcite .",
    "a real gamma beam is obtained through compton backscattering of laser light off a linear electron beam , where most of the photons are produced at the high energy region .",
    "the luminosities for @xmath0 and @xmath39 collisions turn out to be of the same order as the one for @xmath38 @xcite , so the cross sections for photoproduction processes with real photons are considerably larger than the virtual photon case . in our calculations",
    "we consider three different center of mass energies @xmath42=0.5 , 1 and 1.5 tev of the parental linear @xmath38 collider .",
    "the spectrum of the backscattered photons is given by @xcite .",
    "we have    @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath44    with @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the energy of the initial laser photon and @xmath47 is the energy of the initial electron beam before compton backscattering .",
    "@xmath48 is the fraction that represents the ratio of the scattered photon and initial electron energy for the backscattered photons moving along the initial electron direction .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath48 reaches 0.83 when @xmath49 , in which case the backscattered photon energy is maximized without spoiling the luminosity .",
    "the integrated cross section over the backscattered photon spectrum is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the square of the center of mass energy of the subprocess @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath52 is related to @xmath53 , the square of the center of mass energy of @xmath38 , by @xmath54 .    in the sm single production of the top quark via the process @xmath55 is described by four tree level diagrams .",
    "each of the diagrams contains a wtb vertex and , due to its v - a structure , the top quarks produced are highly polarized .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the top quark possesses a high degree of spin polarization when its spin decomposition axis is along the incoming @xmath56 beam .",
    "in the effective lagrangian approach , there are five tree level diagrams ; one of them contains an anomalous @xmath9 vertex , which is absent in the sm ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .    the top quark possesses a large mass , so its helicity is frame dependent and changes under a boost from one frame to another",
    ". the helicity and chirality states do not coincide with each other and there is no reason to believe that the helicity basis will give the best description of the spin of top quarks .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to study other spin bases better than helicity for the top quark spin .",
    "the spin four - vector of a top quark is defined by    @xmath57    where @xmath58 in the top quark rest frame .",
    "top quark spinors are the eigenstates of the operator @xmath59 :    @xmath60 \\,u(p_{t},\\pm s)=\\pm u(p_{t},\\pm s)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using eq.(10 ) one can easily obtain the spin projection operator :    @xmath61    therefore during amplitude calculations one should project the top quark spin onto a given spin direction .",
    "we consider four different top spin directions in the laboratory frame : the incoming positron beam , the photon beam directions and the outgoing @xmath62 direction and also the helicity basis .",
    "the definition of the spin axis in the rest frame of the top quark does not depend on the coordinate frame in which the cross section is taken .",
    "so it is more convenient to calculate the cross section in the @xmath38 center of mass system ( laboratory frame ) . in the top quark rest frame",
    ", its spin direction along any beam ( positron , photon or @xmath62 beam ) can be defined as follows :    @xmath63    here , @xmath64 is the particle momentum ( positron , photon or @xmath62 ) , observed in the rest frame of the top quark . since the particle momentum @xmath65 is first defined in the @xmath38 center of mass system in which the cross section is calculated , @xmath64 should be obtained by a lorentz boost from the @xmath38 cm system :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the velocity of the top quark in the @xmath38 cm system . in the cross section calculations we have performed a boost to obtain @xmath64 at each point in phase space .",
    "one can see from fig.[fig2]-[fig5 ] the influence of the top quark spin polarizations on the deviations of the total cross sections from their sm value at @xmath68 tev . in these figures",
    "an up arrow @xmath69 ( down arrow @xmath70 ) stands for spin up @xmath71 ( spin down @xmath72 ) , and `` l '' and `` r '' represent left and right helicity .",
    "these figures show that cross sections have a symmetric behavior as a function of the anomalous parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we see from fig.[fig4 ] that a polarized cross section is almost insensitive to the anomalous parameter @xmath5 at the @xmath73-beam @xmath70 spin polarization configuration . on the other hand",
    "the cross section at this polarization configuration is very sensitive to the anomalous parameter @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the @xmath73-beam @xmath70 spin polarization configuration can be used to isolate the anomalous coupling parameter @xmath4 .    in our calculations",
    "phase space integrations have been performed by grace @xcite , which uses a monte carlo routine .",
    "angular distributions of the top quark decay products have correlations with its spin polarizations .",
    "let us consider the differential cross section for the complete process including subsequent top decay ,    @xmath74    where @xmath75 are",
    "the momenta of the incoming fermions and @xmath76 are the momenta of the outgoing fermions .",
    "@xmath77 is the square of the full amplitude , which is averaged over the initial spins and summed over the final spins .",
    "the full amplitude can be expressed as follows :    @xmath78    here q and @xmath79 are the internal momentum and spin of the top quark .",
    "@xmath80 is the breit - wigner propagator factor .",
    "it is given by    @xmath81    @xmath82 is the amplitude for the process @xmath19 with an on shell t quark .",
    "@xmath83 is the decay amplitude for @xmath84 .",
    "the square of the decay amplitude summed over the final fermion spins is given by    @xmath85    by means of this amplitude one can easily obtain equation ( 1 ) , the angular distribution of top quark decay .",
    "therefore , the full cross section has been written as a product of production and decay parts .",
    "one can show that interference terms from different spin states will vanish after integrating the decay part over azimuthal angles of top quark decay products .",
    "then the following result can be reached :    @xmath86br\\left(t \\to b \\ell^{+ } \\nu_{\\ell}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 is the leptonic branching ratio for the top quark . up and down arrows indicate the spin up and spin down cases along a specified spin quantization axis , respectively . @xmath88 and @xmath89 are differential decay rates for polarized top quarks .",
    "the unpolarized rate is given by ; @xmath90 .",
    "top quark polarization can be determined by measuring the angular distribution of outgoing charged lepton in the top rest frame .",
    "it is possible to obtain from the expression ( 18 ) the polarized production cross section as a coefficient of the angular distribution by a fitting procedure . in this paper",
    "we ignore the problems associated with the reconstruction of the top rest frame .",
    "we assume that the top quark rest frame can be reconstructed .",
    "we have obtained 95% c.l . limits on the anomalous coupling parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 using a @xmath91 analysis at @xmath7 and @xmath8 tev and an integrated luminosity @xmath92 without systematic errors .",
    "the expected number of events has been calculated considering the leptonic channel of the w boson as the signal @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the overall acceptance .",
    "the limits for the anomalous coupling parameters are given in table [ tab1]-[tab3 ] for top quark spin polarization along the direction of various spin bases with the acceptance @xmath95 .",
    "one can see from these tables that the sensitivity to the anomalous parameter @xmath5 at the @xmath73-beam @xmath70 spin polarization configuration is the worst .",
    "this feature is reflected in fig.[fig4 ] too .",
    "on the other hand , the limits on @xmath5 are most sensitive at the @xmath73-beam @xmath69 spin polarization configuration .",
    "the @xmath73-beam @xmath69 improves the sensitivity limits by a factor of 1.4 at @xmath96 tev and by a factor of 1.5 at @xmath97 tev when compared to the unpolarized ( total ) case .",
    "lower and upper bounds on the anomalous parameter @xmath4 are not symmetric , as can be seen from the tables .",
    "polarization leads to a significant improvement to these sensitivity bounds ; the @xmath62-beam @xmath69 polarization configuration improves the lower bounds on @xmath4 by a factor of 2.7 at @xmath96 tev and by a factor of 2 at @xmath97 tev when compared with the unpolarized ( total ) case . at @xmath96 tev",
    ", @xmath62-beam @xmath70 and helicity right improves the upper bound on @xmath4 by a factor of 1.75 .",
    "these polarization configurations as well as @xmath73-beam @xmath69 leads to an improvement on the upper bound by a factor of 3.5 at @xmath97 tev .",
    "the most sensitive bounds are obtained at @xmath68 tev .",
    "@xmath73-beam @xmath69 and helicity right polarizations improve the upper bounds on @xmath4 by a factor of 5 when compared with the unpolarized case .    as a conclusion",
    ", we have obtained a considerable improvement in the sensitivity bounds by taking into account top quark spin polarization .",
    "improved results by spin polarization in @xmath0 colliders with a luminosity of 500 @xmath98 have a higher potential to probe the @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings than tevatron and cern lhc @xcite and also than the @xmath40 collider tesla+herap option @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the linear @xmath38 collider and its @xmath0 mode provide a clean environment and the experimental clearness is an additional advantage of @xmath0 collisions with respect to @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath40 collisions .",
