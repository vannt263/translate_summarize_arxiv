    "the ionized gas that surrounds young stars in regions and evolved stars in planetary nebulae ( pne ) is subjected to very similar processes , but the gas in regions samples the present interstellar medium ( ism ) , while the gas in pne samples the ism of several gigayears ago , when the progenitor stars formed . hence ,",
    "if we choose an element whose abundance in the pn has not changed significantly from the original one , like oxygen at near - solar metallicities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we can calculate its abundance in regions and pne using the same procedure , and compare the differences with those predicted by galactic chemical evolution .",
    "this potential is somewhat marred by the existing discrepancy between the abundances derived using collisionally excited lines ( cels ) and those implied by recombination lines ( rls ) of the same elements @xcite .",
    "in all the ionized nebulae studied so far , rls imply abundances higher than those implied by cels by factors around 2 in most cases , with some pne showing much higher discrepancies @xcite .",
    "the emissivities of cels have a stronger dependence on temperature than those of rls , and most of the proposed explanations of the difference rely on the production of temperature fluctuations by some mechanism in the observed nebulae",
    ". the exception would be those explanations that consider uncertainties in the recombination coefficients of the heavy elements .",
    "the different explanations of the discrepancy imply that the real abundances will be either close to the values implied by cels , closer to the abundances derived with rls , or intermediate between them ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , a meaningful comparison between the abundances derived for regions and pne must not only take into account the results provided by both cels and rls , but also the fact that the explanation can be different for the two kinds of objects .",
    "a further issue to consider is that the ionizing radiation fields can be very different in regions and pne .",
    "this implies that the corrections for the contribution of unobserved ions to the total abundance , generally based on the relative abundances of two ions of another element , are likely to introduce a different bias in each kind of object .",
    "hence , the best option is to perform the comparison using an element whose dominant ionization states are all observed . in regions and low - ionization pne",
    ", this happens with oxygen . besides",
    ", the required [ ] and [ ] lines can be observed in the optical region of the spectrum along with the other and diagnostic lines needed for the analysis .",
    "this reduces the uncertainties introduced when comparing the relative intensities of lines measured at widely separated wavelengths , with mismatched apertures , and with different telescopes .    in this letter",
    ", we present a comparative analysis of the oxygen abundance in five regions and eight low - ionization pne of the solar neighborhood .",
    "the solar neighborhood is defined here as a region around the sun with a radius of 2 kpc .",
    "this allows us to secure a representative number of objects whose abundances should not be much affected by the galactic abundance gradient .",
    "the analysis follows the same method and uses the same atomic data for all the objects .",
    "we use the best available spectra and provide results for both cels and rls .",
    "the derived oxygen abundances are compared with those implied by nearby young stars and those based on absorption lines in the diffuse ism .",
    "the sample objects were selected from the compilation in @xcite of galactic regions and low ionization pne with available deep optical spectra .",
    "there are around 100800 detected lines in each object and the spectral resolution in the blue is better than 1.5  .",
    "all the objects have individual distance determinations locating them at distances below 2 kpc ( see section  [ an ] below ) .",
    "the distance to ngc  6884 could be larger , but at a galactic longitude of @xmath0 , the effect of the galactic radial abundance gradient should be small .",
    "the pne have been classified as type ii of peimbert @xcite , though ngc  6210 could be of type iii @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that the thin disk progenitors of type ii pne have ages around 46 gyr and initial masses of 1.22.4 m@xmath1 .",
    "we used the same set of lines for the analysis of all the sample objects .",
    "the lines were measured with the same telescope and aperture for each object .",
    "the physical conditions and ionic abundances were calculated with the _ nebular _ package in iraf . in order to check the effect of the atomic data on the calculations",
    ", we performed two sets of calculations .",
    "the first set is based on the atomic data compiled in iraf ; the second one on the atomic data used in the photoionization code cloudy ( version 08.00 , last described by @xcite ) .",
    "below we present the results of the second set and comment on the differences found with the first one .    the adopted electron densities , @xmath2 , are weighted averages of the values implied by the diagnostics [ ] @xmath3 , [ ] @xmath4 , and [ ] @xmath5 . for m17 and the lower ionization objects we do not use the last diagnostic . in m17 the intensity of [ ]",

    "we derive two values for the electron temperature , @xmath10 , one for the high - ionization regions in the nebulae , @xmath10 ( [ ] ) , based on the ratio of line intensities @xmath11 ; another for the low - ionization regions , @xmath10 ( [ ] ) , based on @xmath12 .",

    "the value implied by iraf is @xmath170  dex higher .",
    "this large difference arises because the nebula has a high density and because its oxygen abundance is dominated by o@xmath171 .",
    "when the electron density is high , the absolute uncertainties in @xmath10 ( [ ] ) and @xmath2 are large , and since the estimated o@xmath171 abundance is very sensitive to the physical conditions , its value is subject to large fluctuations .",
    "in fact , as pointed out by the referee , the values of @xmath10 ( [ ] ) are usually affected by many uncertainties , and this could be critical for our purposes .",
    "the [ ] diagnostic ratio is very susceptible to errors in the flux calibration and reddening correction , and can be altered by a contribution from recombination to [ ]  @xmath172 @xcite , or by contamination from high - density objects included in the slit , like cometary knots , globules , proplyds , or herbig - haro objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the recombination contribution can be large for objects with high degrees of ionization , but for these objects o@xmath171 makes a small contribution to the total abundance , which is then barely affected . on the other hand , the contamination by high - density objects could be a problem for the sample pne , since most of them were observed using a long - slit scanning all of their volume .",
    "our sample regions are less likely to be contaminated , since they were observed using small slits ( @xmath173 ) , and include nebulae like m42 , the orion nebula , where proplyds and herbig - haro objects are easily resolved and identified .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath10 ( [ ] ) have prompted some authors to use only @xmath10 ( [ ] ) to calculate all the ionic abundances .",
    "if we did this , the oxygen abundances would be higher by up to 0.03 dex in our pne , and by significant amounts , @xmath174  dex , in the regions : @xmath175 , 8.73 , 8.61 , 8.68 , and 8.64 for m8 , m16 , m17 , m20 , and m42 , respectively .",
    "however , we consider that the evidence for the values of @xmath10 ( [ ] ) shown in table  [ tab1 ] is strong , in particular for the regions .",
    "temperature values similar to those presented here and also satisfying @xmath10 ( [ ] )  @xmath176 ( [ ] ) are generally found at different positions within the bright areas of our sample regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these temperature gradients are also predicted by photoionization models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the temperatures and temperature ratios measured for the sample regions from the same spectra we are using here have been shown to be consistent with the predictions of photoionization models @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the available evidence indicates that our values of @xmath10 ( [ ] ) are reliable , but problems with this temperature could be a possible source of bias when comparing abundances in regions and pne .",
    "the presence of unresolved high - density regions in the observed volumes might also introduce a bias in our results by affecting in different ways the cels we are using @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have argued that small high - density clumps are seriously affecting the intensities of cels in regions , thus producing the discrepancy between cels and rls in these nebulae .",
    "however , both the fact that different density diagnostics imply very similar densities in the sample regions @xcite and the success of constant - density photoionization models in reproducing the intensities of the main cels involved in the determination of electron temperatures and oxygen abundances in these objects @xcite suggest that high - density clumps , if present , have only a small effect on the spectra of our sample regions .",
    "if we now compare our results with those derived by other authors from the same spectra ( see @xcite and @xcite , in addition to the references listed in table  [ tab1 ] ) , the differences are larger , since besides using different atomic data , they use other lines .",
    "the differences are all @xmath177  dex with three exceptions : @xcite find ( o / h)@xmath86 0.21 dex below our value in ic  418 , whereas @xcite and @xcite find ( o / h)@xmath90 0.17 and 0.21  dex above our derived values for ngc  3132 and ngc  6543 , respectively .",
    "finally , we note the importance of using spectra of relatively high spectral resolution in order to obtain the best estimates for the oxygen abundance , even when using strong cels .",
    "if the spectral resolution is poor , [ ]  @xmath178 can be blended with several lines , like [ ]  @xmath179 ,  @xmath180 , and  @xmath181 . in the sample regions",
    ", these blends would lead to values of @xmath10 ( [ ] ) up to 1000  k higher and final oxygen abundances up to 0.05  dex lower . in our sample pne",
    "the effects are smaller : up to 300  k higher @xmath10 ( [ ] ) and oxygen abundances up to 0.02  dex lower .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the total oxygen abundances implied by cels and rls for the regions and pne as a function of @xmath182 .",
    "all the regions show similar abundances , with @xmath183 and @xmath184 , suggesting that the ism in the solar neighborhood is homogeneous .",
    "the pne results show more dispersion , but can be seen to be higher by about 0.2  dex : @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "we expect to find the real oxygen abundances of the nebulae somewhere in the ranges defined by cels and rls , with the different explanations of the discrepancy favoring values at different positions along these ranges .",
    "there are some indications that the explanations might differ in regions and pne , like the fact that all the regions studied so far show moderate discrepancies , whereas pne can show huge discrepancies , like ngc  1501 , where @xcite find @xmath187 and @xmath188 . however ,",
    "at least three of the pne show cels abundances similar to the rls abundances of the regions .",
    "this implies that even if the explanation of the abundance discrepancy is very different in each kind of object , these pne will still show similar or larger oxygen abundances than the regions .",
    "this is contrary to our expectations from simple models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the difference could arise from extensive stellar migration from the inner parts of the galaxy , or gas flows or infall ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an overabundance of oxygen in pne could also arise from oxygen production in the stellar progenitors , although this is not expected to be significant at near - solar metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to shed light on this issue , figure  [ fig1 ] also shows the protosolar abundance of @xcite , the results obtained for several nearby b stars by @xcite , and the range of values found for the diffuse ism by @xcite .",
    "we will assume that these results , which can be considered as representative of the best estimates for these objects , are not affected by important systematic errors and we will try to find a way to reconcile our results with them .",
    "the rls abundances of regions are similar to the b - star values , but their discrepancy with the abundances implied by cels might be difficult to justify , especially if one must look for a mechanism that operates in regions but not in pne .",
    "one possibility is suggested by the different sensitivity of the calculated values of ( o / h)@xmath86 in regions and pne to changes in the assumed temperature structure ( see section  [ an ] ) : temperature fluctuations in a chemically homogeneous medium could be responsible for the discrepancy in regions ( supporting the rls abundances in these nebulae , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas some kind of metal - rich inclusions could produce the discrepancy in pne ( supporting the cels abundances in these objects , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , all these explanations have problems , related to the origin and survival of the metal - rich inclusions or to the nature of the mechanism responsible for the temperature fluctuations ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we explore below an alternative explanation .",
    "the abundances implied by cels in regions are too low , except when compared with the lower values found in the ism .",
    "the oxygen abundances derived by @xcite for the ism follow a trend with the overall amount of depletion implied by all observed elements , suggesting that the different values represent different amounts of depletion onto dust grains .",
    "could the low abundances in regions be due to their having a larger fraction of oxygen deposited in dust grains ?",
    "dust grains in pne and regions should have different characteristics , consisting of recently created stardust in pne , and heavily processed interstellar grains in regions .",
    "however , the amount of oxygen that can be in grains outside of molecular clouds is limited by the availability of atoms of those elements that bind to oxygen to form refractory compounds like oxides and silicates .",
    "@xcite estimates that a maximum of 90140 ppm of oxygen can be located in silicates and oxides . a correction for this amount would increase the value of @xmath189 to a maximum of 8.67 , close to @xmath190 , but at least some of the pne ( ngc  6210 and ngc  6543 ) might need similar corrections , since they harbor oxygen - rich dust like the regions ( @xcite ; delgado - inglada & rodrguez , in preparation ) .    in fact",
    ", @xcite finds that the highest levels of oxygen depletion ( the lowest abundance values ) can not be explained with depletion in silicates and oxides , and concludes that oxygen must be locked up with an element as abundant as hydrogen or carbon .",
    "@xcite points out that a similar shortfall of oxygen ( around 160 ppm ) is observed in molecular clouds , and argues that the most plausible explanation involves an organic refractory dust component arising from the irradiation of ices by uv photons in molecular clouds .",
    "this component would not be expected to be present in pne .",
    "so , is the missing oxygen in regions deposited in cometary - like dust grains ?    correcting the oxygen abundances implied by cels in regions by 160 ppm ( for the oxygen in the organic refractory component ) and 115 ppm ( as an estimate for the oxygen in silicates and oxides ) , we get @xmath191 , in agreement with the b - stars abundances .",
    "this value also agrees with the values implied by cels in pne , even if they are corrected for the presence of silicates and oxides .",
    "the latter agreement is what one would expect from the almost flat age - metallicity relation followed by nearby f and g stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the relatively small dispersion in the abundances derived for our pne suggests that the spread of stellar metallicities at a given age should be smaller than what is usually considered .",
    "in order to confirm our interpretation or to distinguish between other possibilities , homogeneous comparisons of the abundances of other elements would be valuable .",
    "note , however , that they would require studying the bias introduced by the icfs and whether it is different in regions and pne .",
    "we have selected a sample of five regions and eight low - ionization pne that have available spectra of high quality , all of them located at distances lower than 2 kpc .",
    "a homogeneous analysis of their oxygen abundances based on cels and rls shows that the pne are , on average , overabundant by 0.18  dex .",
    "if we take at face value the results implied by b - stars , the sun , and the diffuse ism , along with the almost flat age - metallicity relation implied by f and g stars , we find that for the pne , the abundances implied by cels agree with the expected values , whereas the abundances implied by rls are too high . for the regions ,",
    "the abundances implied by cels are similar to the lower values found by @xcite in the ism , which are explained by @xcite as due to depletion in organic refractory dust grains .",
    "if we assume that these grains are also present in regions , their cels abundances agree with all the other results .",
    "we can thus explain the overabundance of oxygen in pne through the presence of different dust components in regions and pne .",

    "<S> we present a homogeneous analysis of the oxygen abundance in five regions and eight planetary nebulae ( pne ) located at distances lower than 2 kpc and with available spectra of high quality . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the collisionally excited lines and recombination lines imply that the pne are overabundant in oxygen by about 0.2  dex . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation that reconciles the oxygen abundances derived with collisionally excited lines for regions and pne with the values found for b - stars , the sun , and the diffuse ism requires the presence in regions of an organic refractory dust component that is not present in pne . </S>",
    "<S> this dust component has already been invoked to explain the depletion of oxygen in molecular clouds and in the diffuse interstellar medium . </S>"
