    "configurations are necklaces with prescribed numbers of red beads and black beads .",
    "more precisely , they are circular arrangements of a fixed number of red and black beads . besides this model",
    ", configurations can also be interpreted in many other ways , such as finite words in symbolic dynamics  @xcite , line drawing in computer graphics  @xcite and the kawasaki - ising model in statistical mechanics .",
    "the main interest of this paper is a class of extremal configurations which we call regular configurations .",
    "intuitively , in these configurations the colors are evenly distributed .",
    "alternatively , they are the closest configurations to the  random \" ones .",
    "regular configurations are closely linked with balanced words , a well studied object in symbolic dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we will show that there is a unique regular configuration ( up to cyclic shifts ) for a given number of red beads and black beads .",
    "furthermore , an algorithm for computing this configuration is presented .",
    "some other properties of regular configurations are also discussed . to this end",
    "we introduce the concept of dual configurations and prove that a configuration is regular if and only if its dual configuration is regular .",
    "another topic in this paper is shift graphs .",
    "a shift graph is a directed cayley graph of @xmath0 with two generators .",
    "it is also called double loop , cyclic graph or chordal ring in the literature  @xcite .",
    "shift graphs form a subclass of circulant graphs , a type of graph that has been intensively studied  @xcite and has a vast number of applications to telecommunication network , vlsi design and distributed computations  @xcite .    for shift graphs , we use regular configurations to obtain a lower bound for the cycles packing number , the maximum number of pairwise vertex disjoint cycles .",
    "this result also gives an extremal result for sequences and is used to study the guessing number of shift graphs  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present a few models to represent configurations .",
    "the definition of regular configuration is given in section  [ sec : regular ] , where we also briefly discuss some of its properties .",
    "the notion of dual configurations is introduced in section  [ sec : dual ] , with which we study several aspects of regular configurations in section  [ sec : properites ] , including construction , uniqueness and the symmetry group .",
    "the link between regular configurations and balanced words is discussed in section  [ sec : words ] .",
    "the application of regular configurations in shift graphs is investigated in section  [ sect : cycles ] .",
    "given @xmath1 , let @xmath2 denote the set formed by all configurations with a pair of parameters @xmath3 . intuitively , in _ necklace model _ , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively denoting the number of red beads and black beads .",
    "and we will use @xmath6 to denote the length of necklaces .",
    "for instance , fig  [ fig : ball ] is a necklace representing a configuration in @xmath7 . in this section",
    ", we are going to introduce several other models that can represent the configurations in @xmath2 .",
    "the second model is _ the kawasaki - ising model_. in this model , a configuration in @xmath2 is represented by a map @xmath8 from @xmath9 to @xmath10 such that @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the cycle graph on @xmath13 vertices . since a necklace in @xmath2 can be regarded as a vertex coloring of @xmath12 such that @xmath4 vertices are colored with red while the others with black , by denoting red color by @xmath14 and black color by @xmath15 we can convert a necklace into a map in this model . see fig  [ fig : ising ] for such an example , which is obtained from the necklace in fig  [ fig : ball ] .    in some context , it is convenient to represent @xmath14 by @xmath16 and @xmath15 by @xmath17",
    ". then the image of a map @xmath8 in @xmath2 , written as a sequence @xmath18 , is a word over @xmath19 .",
    "more precisely , in _ word model _ , a configuration in @xmath2 is represented by a word of length @xmath13 and weight @xmath4 . here",
    "the weight of a word @xmath20 is defined to be the number of @xmath16s in it .",
    "another model is _ line model _ , arising in compute graphics to answer the following problem : how to draw a zig - zag line from @xmath21 to @xmath3 on the screen to approximate the  real \" line through these two points  @xcite .",
    "we should notice that the scree is represented by the integer lattice @xmath22 and one step from @xmath23 is either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "as in fig  [ fig : line ] , each configuration can be represented by such a zig - zag line .",
    "the last model we will mention is _ polygon model _ , which plays an important role in section  [ sect : cycles ] . in this model , a red bead",
    "is represented by a type i side , a side of length @xmath26 , while a black bead by a type ii side , a side of length @xmath27 .",
    "here we always assume @xmath28 .",
    "then a configuration in @xmath2 is a polygon formed by @xmath4 type i sides and @xmath5 type ii sides .",
    "see fig  [ fig : polygon ] for a configuration in @xmath7 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "[ cc][cc]@xmath31[cc][cc]@xmath32[cc][cc]@xmath33[cc][cc]@xmath34             here we list all these models for @xmath2 because each model relates configurations to different objects .",
    "thus we can study the structure of @xmath2 from different views .",
    "but in this paper we are mainly focused on necklace model , with some applications related with polygon model and word model . in another paper  @xcite , we study regulations from the view of the kawasaki - ising model .    for later use , we will associate two labellings on beads in a necklace .",
    "the first one is to label all beads consecutively from @xmath17 to @xmath35 .",
    "the second one is to consecutively label red(black ) beads from @xmath17 to @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . to avoid potential confusing , in the second labelling the red ( black ) bead with label @xmath38 with be denoted by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "for the first kind labelling on polygons , we assume the vertex is labelled with the number assigned to its right side .",
    "a necklace can be obtained by putting @xmath5 black beads in a round and then inserting a certain amount of red beads between each pair of consecutive black beads .",
    "more precisely , a configuration @xmath41 can be represented by a sequence : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of red beads between black beads @xmath40 and @xmath44 . for brevity ,",
    "we also say the sequence @xmath45 is the _",
    "characteristic sequence _ of the configuration @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , @xmath47 is the characteristic sequence of the configuration in fig  [ fig : ball ] .",
    "two necklaces are considered the same if we can cyclicly rotate one to the other . to formulate this in the sequence level , we need the following definitions .",
    "a shift operator @xmath48 on a sequence @xmath45 is defined to be : @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 if and only if there exists an integer @xmath51 $ ] such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 means applying the operator @xmath48 on the sequence for @xmath54 times .    in other words , @xmath55 is an equivalence relation .",
    "furthermore , @xmath45 and @xmath56 are in the same equivalent class if and only if there exists an integer @xmath57 $ ] such that @xmath58 for all @xmath38 . here the index of the elements in the sequence is calculated with modulo the length of the sequence .",
    "the same convenience will apply to the other sequences in this paper .",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath56 characterize the same configuration in @xmath2 if and only if @xmath59 .",
    "the above proposition can be verified directly from the definitions .",
    "intuitively , it says that a configuration is characterized by a unique equivalence class of sequences .",
    "therefore , in the following sections we also use a sequence to represent a configuration in @xmath2 .",
    "among all possible configurations in @xmath2 , the regular one plays an important role in many applications . in this section we will give a precise definition of regularity and study some of its properties .",
    "when @xmath60 or @xmath61 , there is only one configuration in @xmath2 , the necklace formed by all black beads or by all red beads . to avoid this trivial case , in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will assume @xmath62 and @xmath63 unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "given a configuration @xmath41 with its characteristic sequence @xmath45 , the following equation holds since each red bead should be inserted between a pair of consecutive black beads .",
    "@xmath64    intuitively , when @xmath65 for some @xmath66 , the regular configuration is characterized by the sequence @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , in this case @xmath54 is the expected number of red beads between each pair of consecutive black beads in a random configuration . by random configuration we means to put the beads independently and randomly along the circle .",
    "but when @xmath68 is not an integer , we need the following more subtle condition .",
    "the characteristic sequence of a regular configuration optimizes the following problems : @xmath69    the above expressions measure the deviation between two quantities : the left one is @xmath70 , the number of red beads between @xmath40 and @xmath71 in the configuration , and the right one is the expected number of red beads between @xmath40 and @xmath71 in a random configuration . the smaller value of this deviation ( or _ discrepancy _ as it is sometimes called )",
    "would imply the configuration is closer to the random one . here",
    "we should notice that the deviation is measured for all possible @xmath38 and @xmath72 .",
    "as @xmath73 is always an integer , the expressions in  ( [ exp : optimize ] ) can be simplified as : @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "here we only need to consider the cases for @xmath76 as the other cases can be reduced from them via equation ( [ eq : total ] ) .",
    "denote the system of inequalities in  ( [ eq : regular ] ) by @xmath77 .",
    "then a sequence satisfies @xmath77 if and only if all its equivalent sequences satisfy it . with these preparations",
    ", we are ready to present the formal definition of regularity .    [ prop : idealregular ] a configuration @xmath46 in @xmath2 is regular if its characteristic sequences satisfy the inequalities @xmath77 . in this case , we also say its characteristic sequences are regular .",
    "let @xmath78 be the minimal number of red beads among @xmath79 consecutive black beads .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "then the regularity can be characterized in the following way :    [ lem : regsecond ] @xmath46 is regular if and only if @xmath83 for @xmath84 .    ",

    "this completes the right ones .",
    "the following two propositions can be verified directly from the above lemma .",
