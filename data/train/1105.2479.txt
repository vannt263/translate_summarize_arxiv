    "consider the scattering of time - harmonic electromagnetic waves by a bounded obstacle @xmath1 in @xmath2 with a smooth and simply connected boundary @xmath3 filled with an homogeneous dielectric material .",
    "this problem is described by the system of maxwell s equations with piecewise constant electric permittivity and magnetic permeability , valid in the sense of distributions , which implies two transmission conditions on the boundary of the obstacle guaranteeing the continuity of the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields across the interface . the transmission problem is completed by the silver  mller radiation condition at infinity ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "boundary integral equations are an efficient method to solve such problems for low and high frequencies . the dielectric scattering problem is usually reduced to a system of two boundary integral equations for two unknown tangential vector fields on the interface ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for methods developed by the authors to solve this problem using a single boundary integral equation .",
    "optimal shape design with a goal function involving the modulus of the far field pattern of the dielectric scattering problem has important applications , such as antenna design for telecommunication systems and radars .",
    "the analysis of shape optimization methods is based on the analysis of the dependency of the solution on the shape of the dielectric scatterer , and a local analysis involves the study of derivatives with respect to the shape .",
    "an explicit form of the shape derivatives is desirable in view of their implementation in shape optimization algorithms such as gradient methods or newton s method .    in this paper",
    ", we present a complete analysis of the shape differentiability of the solution of the dielectric scattering problem and of its far field pattern , using integral representations .",
    "even if numerous works exist on the calculus of shape derivatives of various shape functionals @xcite , in the framework of boundary integral equations the scientific literature is not extensive .",
    "however , one can cite the papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where r.  potthast has considered the question , starting with his phd thesis @xcite , for the helmholtz equation with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions and the perfect conductor problem , in spaces of continuous and hlder continuous functions . using the integral representation of the solution , one is lead to study the gteaux differentiability of boundary integral operators and potential operators with weakly singular and hypersingular kernels .",
    "the natural space of distributions ( energy space ) which occurs in the electromagnetic potential theory is @xmath0 , the set of tangential vector fields whose components are in the sobolev space @xmath4 and whose surface divergence is in @xmath4 .",
    "we face two main difficulties : on one hand , the solution of the scattering problem is given in terms of products of boundary integral operators and their inverses . in order to be able to construct shape derivatives of such products , it is not sufficient to find shape derivatives of the boundary integral operators , but it is imperative to prove that the derivatives are bounded operators between the same spaces as the boundary integral operators themselves . on the other hand ,",
    "the very definition of shape differentiability of operators defined on the shape - dependent space @xmath0 poses non - trivial problems .",
    "our strategy consists in using the helmholtz decomposition of this hilbert space which gives a representation of a tangential vector field in terms of ( tangential derivatives of ) two scalar potentials . in this way",
    ", we split the analysis into two steps : first the gteaux differentiability analysis of scalar boundary integral operators and potential operators with strongly and weakly singular kernels , and second the study of shape derivatives of surface differential operators .",
    "this work contains results from the thesis @xcite where this analysis has been used to develop a shape optimization algorithm of dielectric lenses in order to obtain a prescribed radiation pattern .",
    "this is the second of two papers on shape derivatives of boundary integral operators , the first one @xcite being aimed at a general theory of shape derivatives of singular integral operators appearing in boundary integral equation methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ boundintop ] we recall some standard results about trace mappings and regularity properties of the boundary integral operators in electromagnetism . in section [ scatprob ]",
    "we define the scattering problem for time - harmonic electromagnetic waves at a dielectric interface .",
    "we then give an integral representation of the solution  and of the quantity of interest , namely the far field of the dielectric scattering problem  following the single source integral equation method developed in @xcite .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are dedicated to the shape differentiability analysis of the solution of the dielectric scattering problem .",
    "we use the results of our first paper @xcite on the gteaux differentiability of boundary integral operators with pseudo - homogeneous kernels .",
    "we refer to this paper for a discussion of the notion of gteaux derivatives in frchet spaces and of some of their basic properties . in section [ helmholtzdec ]",
    "we discuss the difficulties posed by the shape dependency of the function space @xmath0 on which the integral operators are defined , and we present a strategy for dealing with this difficulty , namely using the well - known tool @xcite of helmholtz decomposition . in our approach , we map the variable spaces @xmath5 to a fixed reference space with a transformation that preserves the hodge structure .",
    "this technique involves the analysis of surface differential operators that have to be considered in suitable sobolev spaces .",
    "therefore in section we recall and extend the results on the differentiability properties of surface differential operators established in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) . using the rules on derivatives of composite and inverse functions , we obtain in section [ shapesol ] the shape differentiability properties of the solution of the scattering problem .",
    "more precisely , we prove that the boundary integral operators are infinitely gteaux differentiable without loss of regularity , whereas previous results allowed such a loss @xcite , and we prove that the shape derivatives of the potentials are smooth away from the boundary but they lose regularity in the neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "this implies that the far field is infinitely gteaux differentiable , whereas the shape derivatives of the solution of the scattering problem lose regularity .",
    "these new results generalize existing results : in the acoustic case , using a variational formulation , a characterization of the first gteaux derivative was given by a. kirsch @xcite for the dirichlet problem and then by hettlich @xcite for the impedance problem and the transmission problem .",
    "an alternative technique was introduced by kress and pivrinta in @xcite to investigate frchet differentiability in acoustic scattering by the use of a factorization of the difference of the far - field pattern of the scattered wave for two different obstacles . in the electromagnetic case ,",
    "potthast used the integral equation method to obtain a characterization of the first shape derivative of the solution of the perfect conductor scattering problem . in @xcite , kress improved this result by using a far - field identity and in @xcite kress and haddar extended this technique to acoustic and electromagnetic impedance boundary value problems .",
    "at the end of section [ shapesol ] we obtain a characterization of the first shape derivative of the solution of the dielectric scattering problem as the solution of a new electromagnetic transmission problem .",
    "we show by deriving the integral representation of the solution that the first derivative satisfies the homogeneous maxwell equations , and by directly deriving the boundary values of the solution itself we see that the first derivative satisfies two new transmission conditions on the boundary .    in the end",
    "we will have obtained two different algorithms for computing the shape derivative of the solution of the dielectric scattering problem and of the far field pattern : a first one by differentiating the integral representations and a second one by solving the new transmission problem associated with the first derivative .",
    "the characterization of the derivatives as solutions to boundary value problems has been obtained in the acoustic case by kress @xcite , kirsch @xcite , hettlich and rundell @xcite and hohage @xcite and has been used for the construction of newton - type or second degree iterative methods in acoustic inverse obstacle scattering . whereas the use of these characterizations requires high order regularity assumption for the boundary",
    ", we expect that the differentiation of the boundary integral operators does not require much regularity .",
    "although in this paper we treat the case of a smooth boundary , in the last section we give some ideas on possible extensions of the results of this paper to non - smooth domains .    a final remark on the terminology of derivatives with respect to the variation of the domain",
    ": for the solutions of boundary value problems with a moving boundary , in the context of continuum mechanics one distinguishes frequently between _ material derivatives _ and _ shape derivatives_. the former correspond to the gteaux derivative with respect to the deformation , which is then interpreted as a flow associated with a velocity field , when the solution is pulled back to a fixed undeformed reference domain ( lagrangian coordinates ) . depending on the interpretation of the flow ,",
    "other names are used , such as `` lagrangian derivative '' , or `` substantial derivative '' .",
    "the shape derivatives , on the other hand , correspond to the gteaux derivative of the solution in the deformed domain ( eulerian coordinates ) .",
    "one also talks about `` eulerian derivative '' .",
    "the difference between the two has the form of a convection term , which can lead to a loss of one order of regularity of the shape derivative on the support of the velocity field @xcite . in the context of this terminology ,",
    "the derivatives of the boundary integral operators that we studied in part i of this paper @xcite for general pseudohomogeneous kernels and in this paper for the boundary integral operators of electromagnetism , correspond to the lagrangian point of view , because they are obtained by pull - back to a fixed reference boundary .",
    "however , the derivative of the solution of dielectric scattering problem that we construct in section [ shapesol ]  with the help of the derivatives of the boundary integral operators  is the eulerian shape derivative .",
    "we also observe the loss of one order of regularity of the shape derivative with respect to the solution of the transmission problem . finally , for the far field , the two notions of derivative coincide , because the deformation has compact support .",

    "let us briefly indicate why we think this is so .",
    "we consider the case where the boundary @xmath3 is merely lipschitz , but the deformation is defined by a vector field @xmath319 that is smooth ( at least @xmath482 ) in a neighborhood of @xmath3 . note that the reduction to purely normal displacements that is often used for studying shape optimization problems for smooth boundaries does not make sense here , as soon as there are corners present .",
    "in this situation , many of the ingredients of our toolbox are still available . here",
    "are some of them .",
    "first , the change of variables mapping @xmath212 still defines an isomorphism between @xmath238 and @xmath239 . by duality",
    ", we see that the mapping @xmath483 defines an isomorphism between @xmath484 and @xmath485 .",
    "when we want to transport the energy space @xmath206 , we can still use helmholtz decomposition .",
    "namely , the following result is known , see @xcite .        a natural idea for the transport of the energy trace space is then , instead of , to define @xmath489 this is justified by the sequence of isomorphisms @xmath490 the inverse of the transformation @xmath234 is given by @xmath491 in this situation it seems to be more convenient to rewrite the operators @xmath261 and @xmath274 as operators acting on the the scalar fields @xmath492 and @xmath493 instead of @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "for example , the operator @xmath261 is defined for @xmath496 by @xmath497 with @xmath498\\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath499 \\vspace{3mm}\\\\ & & + \\dfrac{1}{\\kappa}\\left(\\tau_{r}v^{r}_{\\kappa}\\tau_{r}^{-1}\\right)\\left(j_{r}^{-1}p^{*}\\right ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] here we have used the same notation for the surface differential operators as introduced in section  [ surfdiffop ]",
    ". these formulas together with similar ones for the operator @xmath500 can now be the starting point for generalization of the analysis of shape differentiability of the maxwell boundary integral operators to lipschitz domains .",
    "we expect that the results for the differentiability of the surface differential operators and then also of the boundary integral operators will be similar to what we have obtained for the case of smooth domains .",
