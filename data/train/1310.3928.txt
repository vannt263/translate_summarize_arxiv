    "one might ask why we should be particularly interested in the gaia data for pulsating variable stars so far as galactic composition , structure and dynamics are concerned . in the present review we discuss the importance of some major classes of pulsating variables , classical cepheids , rr lyrae variables , type ii cepheids and miras .",
    "these variables , once their luminosities are calibrated by gaia , will provide accurate distances both within our galaxy and beyond , reaching beyond the distances achieved by gaia itself . we will also point out some of the special problems that these stars pose for gaia .",
    "table 1 gives the expected accuracy ( @xmath0 ) of the absolute magnitudes determined for single relatively bright stars ( @xmath1mag ) and assuming that for such stars @xmath2 ( see esa gaia web page ) .",
    "the table also gives an estimate of the statistical bias expected in the absolute magnitude calibration ( lutz - kelker type bias ) .",
    "these values of the bias are small .",
    "however , they are significant if one is aiming to obtain distance scales with an accuracy of 2 percent or better ( 0.04mag ) . such accuracies are already being claimed for the distance modulus of the lmc ( 0.04mag from eclipsing binaries ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2013 ) and as small as 0.03mag for classical cepheids , if metallicity effects are ignored ) .",
    "furthermore , these bias corrections are asymmetrical and have large uncertainties ( koen 1992 ) due to their statistical nature and to the assumptions made in estimating them .",
    "thus it is unlikely that stars in a given sample are always selected on the basis of parallax alone or that they are drawn from a population distributed uniformly in space .",
    "note also that the bias correction required depends on the use to which the parallaxes are to be put ( e.g. estimating distance moduli or estimating distance ( see , e.g. , feast 2013 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that some vlbi parallaxes of star forming regions ( e.g. reid et al . 2009 ) have percentage accuracies similar to those expected from gaia and are presumably subject to bias ( stepanishchev & bobylev 2013 ) though the effect of this on derived galactic constants is probably complex ( see bovy , these proceedings ) .",
    "these considerations are important for the use of gaia parallaxes in calibrating luminosities . in the next few sections we summarize the present status of the luminosity calibration of some well known variable stars and indicate what advances we can expect from gaia .",

    "2007 , van leeuwen et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the slope of this relation is close to that found for lmc cepheids , which are metal deficient with respect to those in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "however , the slope evidently depends rather critically on one point .",
    "also , both in the galaxy and beyond , the long period cepheids , being bright , are important .",
    "if it is assumed that the galactic relation has the same slope as that found in the lmc , then a galactic zero - point can be found from hst and hipparcos parallaxes using the method of reduced parallaxes .",

    "the scatter may have a component due to the thickness of the lmc , but is probably mainly observational : that in @xmath9 being greater due to the coefficient of the colour term in @xmath10 being numerically larger . in using gaia data on cepheids to calibrate the @xmath11 relations it is obvious that one must aim to keep bias effects very small and it is also desirable that the individual uncertainties are if possible considerably smaller than the lmc scatter just quoted . as a rough guide table 1 suggests that one should be limiting oneself to cepheids within about 2kpc . with this restriction",
    "we can expect many cepheids with periods less that 10 days with @xmath12 , perhaps about 20 with the same uncertainty and periods over 10 days , and rather few in this category with periods over 20 days .",
    "of course , all this may change when the actual performance of gaia is known , but it suggests that at the shorter periods there will be sufficient data to study the various cepheid relations in some detail , including estimates of their intrinsic scatter . at the longest periods we may be forced to employ the method of reduced parallaxes on more distance samples , possibly grouping the stars according to period .    ) , with projected distance to the sun plotted versus height above the galactic plane .",

    "this together with gaia results on the @xmath19 zero - point , intrinsic scatter and ( hopefully ) metallicity effects , will allow the distribution ( and with ( infrared ) velocities ) the kinematics of cepheids over much of the galactic disc to be determined .",

    "if the statistical parallax result were used it would imply an lmc modulus near 18.2mag , and a distance to the galactic centre near 7kpc , in contrast to most other estimates which are near 8kpc ( see , e.g. feast ( 2013 ) for a discussion of lmc and galactic centre distances ) .",
    "this difference is not understood at present .",
    "there seems a possibility that the statistical parallax result might be affected by the relatively simple model of the halo assumed .",
    "clearly gaia parallaxes will place the calibration on a much improved footing .",
    "there are many rr lyraes with @xmath1 mag and distances less than about 2kpc .",
    "thus gaia parallaxes should provide excellent calibrations for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 relations including estimates of their intrinsic scatter and any metallicity effect on the @xmath30 relation .",
    "this will , however , require good infrared light - curves for the calibrators .",
    "in addition good values of [ fe / h ] will be required , either from gaia itself or from the ground .",
    "provided any metallicity effect on the @xmath31 relation is determined ( using gaia data ) and the low scatter in this relation , just mentioned , is confirmed , this relation should give better distances than the gaia parallaxes themselves for rr lyraes further away than about 2kpc .",
    "it will then be possible to carry out extensive studies of the distribution ( and kinematics ) of rr lyraes over a large volume ( note that an rr lyrae with a period of 0.5 days has @xmath32mag at 10kpc . )",

    "they are often divided into groups according to period : bl  her stars ( @xmath34days ) , w  vir stars ( @xmath35days ) and rv  tau stars ( @xmath36days ) .",
    "their potential importance as distance indicators has only recently been fully recognized .",
    "this is due primarily to the work of matsunaga et al .",

    "the lmc results ( in @xmath30 and @xmath37 , fig.[typeii_pl ] b and c ) are broadly in agreement with the globular clusters and the low scatter suggests that any metallicity effect is small .",

    "the zero - points of type ii cepheid relations have to be estimated assuming the distances to globular clusters or to the lmc , or using pulsation parallaxes .",
    "gaia should allow direct calibration from parallaxes .",
    "this and the following sections discuss mira variables , which are large amplitude pulsators at the tip of the agb .",
    "the class contains both o - rich and c - rich stars , the latter due to stellar dredge - up processes .",
    "there is currently a great deal of interest in these stars and gaia should enable major advances in understanding them and in using them to study galactic structure .",
    "much of the current interest is related to new mid- and far - infrared observations ( e.g. using the herschel and spitzer spacecraft ) and to the study of mass loss and dust formation which are not quantitatively understood .",
    "this is crucial for our understanding of stellar evolution and the composition of the interstellar medium , especially at early times . at the same time , interferometry is providing new insights on the diameters and overall shapes of these stars as well as on their surface non - uniformities .",
    "it is known from the lmc that both o- and c - rich miras follow similar infrared pl relations ( fig.[lmc_miras ] ) .",
    "these relations show a scatter ( per star ) of 0.14mag which is clearly an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter . using hipparcos parallaxes alone the zero - point for the o - rich stars",
    "is obtained with an uncertainty of @xmath38mag , while including other methods ( whitelock et al .",
    "2008 ) brings this down to @xmath39mag .",
    "since there are large numbers of galactic miras ( the gcvs gives a very incomplete list of about 8000 ) gaia should in principle make a significant improvement on this calibration . however , these stars present some serious , and unique , challenges to gaia , as outlined below .",
    "all miras have large ranges in visual magnitude ; they are defined as having photographic or @xmath29 changes in excess of @xmath40mag ( though some stars with smaller amplitudes are similar to miras ) and the range can exceed 10mag for very red stars .",
    "mira itself , @xmath41 ceti , has a range of over 6 mag ( e.g. barths & mattei 1997 ) .",
    "this will mean that some of the variables will be either too bright or too faint to be accurately observed by gaia at some phases .",
    "for instance , whilst the gcvs lists 1883 miras which are brighter than visual or photographic magnitude 12 at maximum , only 18 lie in the range 6 to 12 mag at all phases , the range for the most accurate parallaxes ( see table  1 ) . of these , eleven are o - rich and seven c - rich and have periods in the range 200 to 450 days .",
    "additionally , whilst the periods of miras are typically in the range 100 to 1000 days , the period distribution in the solar neighbourhood peaks between 200 and 400 days and there are many miras with periods near one year which will also present problems given the baseline for parallax measurement .",

    "closed symbols represent o- and c - rich miras , respectively.,width=326 ]      it has long been known that the angular sizes of miras are large and depend on the wavelength at which they are measured .",
    "this is due to the great depth of the atmosphere and the variation of opacity with wavelength .",
    "for instance speckle interferometry showed that for o miras , the diameter in the tio bands was double that in the nearby continuum ( labeyrie et al .",
    "the size is a minimum in the near infrared , but even there it will be greater than the parallax , e.g. , for @xmath41 ceti , the hipparcos parallax is @xmath42mas and the angular diameter at @xmath43m@xmath44 is @xmath45mas ( mennesson et al .",
    "early interferometric work ( e.g. lattanzi et al .",
    "1997 ) showed that these stars are not well represented by uniform circular discs . in the case of c miras , near - infrared photometry ( whitelock et al .",
    "1997 , 2006 , feast et al .",
    "2003 ) provided evidence that some of these stars produce dust erratically as puffs in random directions , after the manner of r  crb stars and possibly connected with large convection cells .",
    "advances in interferometric techniques and high resolution imaging ( e.g.   fig.[leao ] ) have confirmed this .",

    "however , given the wealth of the expected gaia data , we may hope that it will offer new insights into mass loss and convection in these stars , which are at present very poorly understood , as well as giving us valuable parallaxes , proper motions and radial velocities .",
    "it has been known for some while now that the period of a mira is a measure of its age , the relation being similar for o- and c - rich miras .",
    "the main evidence for this is the relation between kinematics and period , as well as the miras in galactic globular clusters and in intermediate age magellanic cloud clusters ( see feast ( 2009 ) for a summary ) .",
    "we can estimate rough ages of @xmath46gyr for 200 day miras and @xmath47gyr at 500 days",
    ". the very long period oh / ir miras must be even younger and more massive .",
    "an interesting case in which this age / mass and period relation appears to be violated is that of the 551-day mira in the centre of the globular cluster lyng7 .",
    "this object which is known to be c - rich ( in contrast to miras in other galactic globular clusters ) was investigated by feast et al .",
    "( 2013 ) who established that it was a radial velocity member .",
    "its initial mass is expected to have been @xmath48 , i.e , about twice the turn - off mass in the cluster .",

    "we find that it has @xmath49mag , in excellent agreement with the predictions from the pl relation of @xmath50mag .",
