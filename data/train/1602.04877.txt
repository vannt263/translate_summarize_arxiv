    "frequency division multiplexing ( gfdm ) @xcite has attracted much attention in recent years as a candidate waveform of 5 g cellular systems for its low spectral leakage due to the flexibility of its pulse shaping filter @xcite .",
    "a pulse shaping filter with better spectral property , however , may cause intersymbol interference ( isi ) and inter carrier interference ( ici ) , which becomes more severe in a broadband channel and may cause problems at the receiver . among the methods in @xcite for signal recovery in the receiver for a gfdm system , matched filter ( mf )",
    "receiver maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) while causing self - interference from the nonorthogonality of the transmit waveform .",
    "zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver can cancel the self - interference at the price of the channel noise enhancement . to reduce the high self - interference in mf , mf with successive interference cancellation ( mf - sic ) receiver",
    "is presented in @xcite at the cost of high - complexity iterative processing .",
    "linear minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver can improve the performance of zf receiver .",
    "however , based on the transmitter matrix for generating the gfdm signal , these gfdm receivers have high complexities proportional to the square of the total number of the data symbols in a gfdm symbol . to obtain a low - complexity implementation in the gfdm receiver , based on fast fourier transform ( fft ) and inverse fft ( ifft ) , fft - based zf / mf @xcite",
    ", fft - based mf - sic @xcite and several techniques for mf @xcite , zf @xcite , and mmse @xcite are proposed . in the ideal channel , among the low - complexity methods ,",
    "the zf / mf receiver in @xcite can obtain the lowest complexity by splitting the multiplication of the transmitter matrix and discrete fourier transform ( dft)/inverse dft ( idft ) matrix into small blocks with fft / ifft implementation . in a broadband channel , besides the complexity of the techniques themselves , another key factor is the channel equalization that should be considered in the receiver . since the direct channel equalization in time domain in @xcite has a high complexity proportional to the square of the total number of the data symbols in a gfdm symbol , frequency domain equalization ( fde ) can be used to reduce the complexity @xcite . in this case , the proposed receivers in @xcite have lower computational cost than the low - complexity receivers in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , compared to the orthogonal frequency multiplexing division ( ofdm ) receiver , the fde @xcite needs extra fft / ifft operations , where in @xcite , it is called zf / mf receiver directly and its complexity will be compared in details .    in this paper , to simplify the gfdm receiver for a broadband channel similar to the ofdm receiver , a relationship between a gfdm signal and discrete gabor transform ( dgt ) @xcite is first investigated , similar to @xcite , @xcite , i.e , a transmit gfdm signal is an inverse dgt ( idgt ) of a data array .",
    "then , according to dgt @xcite , a frequency - domain dgt is proposed for gfdm signal recovery , which is different from the time - domain dgt in @xcite , @xcite causing high - complexity time - domain channel equalization . by analyzing the interference after the frequency - domain dgt for gfdm signals ,",
    "we conclude that the coherence bandwidth , related to the reciprocal of the maximum channel delay , and the roll - off factor of a transmit waveform are two key factors of the interference in a gfdm system , where high coherence bandwidth and small roll - off factor can make the gfdm signal recovered by the frequency - domain dgt much like ofdm .",
    "furthermore , to reduce the complexity of the frequency - domain dgt in the whole band , a suboptimal frequency - domain dgt in local subbands , called local dgt ( ldgt ) , is proposed .",
    "simulation results show that the frequency - domain dgt with small roll - off factor can achieve considerable bit - to - error rate ( ber ) performance close to ofdm , and ldgt significantly reduces the complexity of the frequency - domain dgt with a small ber performance degradation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , gfdm signals are formulated in transmitter as idgt and in receiver as dgt , and the frequency domain dgt is proposed . in section iii ,",
    "a received gfdm signal is formulated by the frequency - domain dgt followed by analyzing the interference generated in the frequency - domain dgt , and ldgt is presented and analyzed for complexity reduction . in section iv , simulation results for the frequency - domain dgt , ldgt , and several other existing gfdm signal recovery methods are presented . finally , in section",
    "v , this paper is concluded .",
    "in this section , transmitted and received gfdm signals are first briefly introduced .",
    "then , based on the theory of dgt , an idgt is investigated for a transmitted gfdm signal .",
    "lastly , a frequency - domain dgt is proposed for the gfdm signal recovery .      in gfdm transmitter ,",

    "however , when the transmitter matrix has a large size , these receivers with the time - domain channel equalization have high complexities .",
    "our goal here is to simplify the gfdm receiver with insignificant ici and isi .      without the channel influence , i.e. , in an ideal channel , in order to cancel the isi and ici for the gfdm signal recovery ,",
    "the properties of the transmitted gfdm signal should be first investigated .",
    "to do so , let us briefly review dgt and idgt . for a signal @xmath20 , @xmath35 ,",

    "in other words , or is a receiver for gfdm signals in an ideal channel or a narrow band channel .",
    "the reason why the frequency domain dgt is mentioned here is for a broadband channel in next section .",
    "in this section , we formulate a received gfdm signal similar to ofdm by the proposed frequency - domain dgt in a broadband channel .",
    "two models are proposed and analyzed , in which the frequency - domain dgt in the whole band is considered in the first model and ldgt is proposed in the second model for the complexity reduction .      from , in a broadband channel , to use the time - domain dgt at the receiver , the time - domain channel equalization in the whole gfdm symbol of length _",
