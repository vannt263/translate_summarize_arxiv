    "the extensive numerical experiments reported in @xcite indicate that the convergence rates of our theorems are sharp . on the other hand , the conditions that we have to impose on the spectrum of the wiener process , conditions ( [ eqn : conds_g_s ] ) and ( [ eqn : conds_g_b ] ) , are not sharp and are not  in general ",
    "independent from one another . in order to optimize these conditions",
    "one needs more detailed information on the specific problem under investigation , in particular on the properties of the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath85 .",
    "consider for example the case where @xmath85 is a uniformly elliptic operator , remarks [ rem : ell1 ] and [ rem : ell_2 ] .",
    "let us now try give an intuitive explanation of our results .",
    "first , for @xmath108 the particle relaxation time which is of @xmath165 is large compared to the relaxation time of the noise  which is of @xmath166 and consequently the particles experience a rough noise with practically zero correlation time .",
    "this means that for @xmath108 the ou process is not viewed from the point of view of the particle as a smooth approximation to white noise and , as a result , the stochastic integral in the limiting equation has to be interpreted in the it sense . on the other hand , when @xmath152 , the particle relaxation time is small compared to that of the noise .",
    "consequently , in this parameter regime the rescaled ou process is indeed a smooth gaussian approximation to white noise and the stochastic integral in the limiting sde should be interpreted in the stratonovich sense as in equation , in agreement with standard theorems .",
    "the case @xmath167 leads to the case of tracer particles whose relaxation time is zero and covered precisely by these standard theorems .    for the case",
    "@xmath32 the particle relaxation time is comparable in magnitude to the noise correlation time and a resonance mechanism prevails which results in the limiting stochastic integral being neither that of it nor that of stratonovich . in this case the drift correction to the it stochastic integral depends on the detailed properties of the ou process , in particular its covariance .    it is well known that for second order stochastic differential equations the it and stratonovich interpretations of the stochastic integral coincide . for certain gaussian fields @xmath44 this",
    "also happens for the limiting equations given in our convergence theorems : the stratonovich correction , as well as its modified version from theorem [ thm : gamma_two ] , will , in some situations , be identically zero due to the specific properties of @xmath44 . in this case",
    "the limiting equations are the same for all values of @xmath27 .",
    "this situation occurs for example in the inertial particles problem which is discussed in section [ sec : applications ] , due to the fact that the fluid velocity is assumed to be homogeneous and incompressible .",
    "let us now outline the method that we will use in order to prove the results of this paper .",
    "the first step is to use the variation of constants formula to write the particle velocity @xmath168 and particle position @xmath124 as follows : @xmath169 and @xmath170 respectively .",
    "the next step is to use equations and in order to obtain sharp estimates on the moments of the particle velocity .",
    "the basic strategy will be to derive first estimates valid for @xmath46 and then use them in order to obtain sharper estimates valid for @xmath28 .",
    "we emphasize that sharper estimates for @xmath171 are necessary for the proofs of the convergence theorems . now , with the estimates for the moments at hand we prove that the last two integrals on the right hand side of equation are small in @xmath172 , \\mathbb{r}))$ ] for all values of @xmath173",

    "we refer to this as @xmath175 .",
    "we use the it formula , together with the estimates on the moments of the particle velocity , to show that @xmath175 consists of an @xmath25 term plus higher order corrections .",
    "the leading order term in @xmath175 is different for @xmath176 and @xmath143 : this is the term which is responsible for the difference in the limiting equations for different @xmath27 . finally , the proof of the convergence theorems is completed by an application of gronwall s lemma .    throughout the paper",
    "we will make extensive use of estimates on the infinite dimensional ou process @xmath44 as well as the stochastic convolution @xmath177 lemmas [ lem : est_vel ] and [ lemma : stoch_conv ] , respectively . the proof of the first of the above lemmas is based on borell s inequality from the theory of gaussian processes @xcite , while the proof of the second uses the factorization method @xcite .",
    "we remark that , unlike the methods used in the proofs of the convergence theorems in @xcite , the proof in this paper relies on the presence of the friction term @xmath178 in the equations of motion .",
    "the linear friction term enables us to obtain representations and for the particle velocity and position , respectively , which are necessary for analyzing the dependence of various moment bounds on @xmath4 .",
