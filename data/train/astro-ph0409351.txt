    "the origin of the optical and infrared ( ir ) emission in anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) is currently uncertain . to date",

    "optical emission has been detected @xcite and was seen to pulse at the same period as the x - ray pulsar @xcite .",
    "all of these sources show excess optical / ir emission when compared to the prediction of a simple blackbody model extrapolated from x - ray energies ( assuming the 2-component model consisting of a power - law plus blackbody component for the x - ray emission ) .",
    "the extrapolation of the power - law component greatly overpredicts the optical / ir flux , however .    on 2002",
    "june 18 , 1e  2259 + 586 exhibited an outburst that included , apart from the @xmath680 bright , short - lived x - ray bursts , a large and long - lived x - ray flux enhancement with subsequent decay @xcite , as well as a significant near - ir flux enhancement , demonstrated with gemini - north target of opportunity observations made 3 and 10 days after the outburst @xcite .",
    "this was the first demonstration of ir variability in an axp , and subsequently the first example of an associations between x - ray and ir activity .",
    "since then , ir variability has also been reported in 1e  1048.1@xmath55937 @xcite and 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite without evidence for a correlation with x - ray outbursts , though sparsity in x - ray observations do not preclude this .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that a second near - ir observation of the proposed counterpart to xte  j1810@xmath5197 showed variablity possibly linked to x - ray flux decay .    in order to verify that the enhancement in ir flux seen post - outburst in 1e  2259 + 586",
    "was genuinely related to the outburst , as well as to characterize its decay , we monitored the source using the gemini north telescope . here",
    "we report on this program , demonstrating conclusively that the ir enhancement reported by @xcite was associated with the outburst .",
    "we also find that the post - outburst ir and x - ray radiation properties are correlated . in  [ sec : disc ] , we compare our results with expectations from different models and other axps .",
    "images in the near - ir @xmath7 band ( @xmath8 m , @xmath9 m ) were obtained with the near - infrared imager ( niri ; f/6 camera ; aladdin insb detector array ; @xmath10 pixels ; @xmath11 pixel size ) at the 8-m gemini north observatory . for a description of the observing parameters and conditions ,",
    "see table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the detector array was read several times in order to reduce read - out noise .",
    "this was done both before and after each exposure , and the difference was recorded in the data files .",
    "each target frame consisted of 4 coadded exposures of 15-s integrations .",
    "two earlier observations of 1e  2259 + 586 , which took place 3 and 10 days after the x - ray burst in june 2002 as part of a target of opporunity ( too ) program , were described in @xcite and are also included in this analysis .",
    "all data were reduced using the gemini iraf package for niri data .",
    "each frame was divided by a normalized flat field constructed from the lamp flat frames obtained with the gemini standard calibration unit .",
    "the sky background image was derived from the data frames themselves with the objects masked out , taking advantage of the 9-point dither pattern applied during the observation : this was subtracted from all data frames .",
    "finally , all data from a single night were coadded into one image .",
    "photometry was performed using standard procedures within the daophot package @xcite as implemented in iraf . to calibrate the instrumental magnitudes found by daophot",
    ", we tied our measurements directly to stars in the 1e  2259 + 586 field @xcite .",
    "the eight nearest neighbours that were bright , isolated and not varying ( stars a , b , b@xmath12 , d , f , g , k and n under the numbering system of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used to measure the mean offset between the instrumental and published @xmath7 band magnitudes . to verify non - variability",
    ", we chose only stars that fell within a standard devation of @xmath13  mag from the weighted mean .",
    "the advantage of this procedure was that it gave much more precise _ relative _ fluxes than would have been possible by using the single standard star observed during each night .",
    "measured @xmath7 band magnitudes of 1e  2259 + 586 are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we analytically estimated magnitude errors from the standard deviation of the sky background , under the assumption that an aperture with a radius equal to the psf fwhm contains 70% of a star s flux : this was added in quadrature to the uncertainty in the photometric tie to produce final uncertainties in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "our careful re - analysis of the too data ( the first two points ) gave results consistent with @xcite well within uncertainties : the differences in @xmath7 magnitude between the two analyses were @xmath14 ( jun .",
    "21 ) and @xmath15 ( jun . 28 ) .",
    "the third data point was observed with the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) by @xcite : we have assumed @xmath16 in our magnitude to flux conversion . from table  [ tab : obs ] , one sees that @xmath0400  days post - burst , the source appears to have returned to its pre - burst brightness of @xmath17  mag @xcite .",
    "the post - outburst evolution of the x - ray pulsed flux of 1e  2259 + 586 is described by @xcite in terms of a model with two power laws in time , where @xmath4 , with @xmath18 the unabsorbed 2@xmath510  kev pulsed flux , @xmath19 the time since the glitch epoch @xmath20mjd , and @xmath21 the power - law index . immediately after the outburst ( @xmath221  day )",
    "the decay appears to follow a much steeper power - law index than it does over the following year .",
    "we compare the near - ir flux enhancement and decay to those of the second , slower x - ray segment consisting of flux from @xmath61  day post - burst , for which @xcite find a temporal decay index of @xmath23 .    to the near - ir data",
    ", we first apply an extinction correction of @xmath24 , which is inferred from @xmath25  @xmath26  mag @xcite where @xmath27  @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are then converted to @xmath29 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] and figure  [ fig : decay ] ) .",
    "we fit a simple power - law function , @xmath30 , to the x - ray and ir flux using a numerical @xmath31 fitting program that directly searches over parameter space , where @xmath32 is a constant with dimensions erg / s/@xmath33 , @xmath19 is time in days since the glitch , and the choice of the factor of 100 roughly minimizes the covariance between @xmath32 and @xmath21 .",
    "note also that @xmath18 represents both x - ray flux and near - ir @xmath29 , depending on the case , in erg / s/@xmath33 .",
    "table  [ tab : fit ] contains our best - fit parameter values and 1@xmath34 uncertainties .",
    "fitting the _ rxte _ pulsed - flux data only , we confirm the index @xmath21 reported by @xcite fit on log - log data to a linear function , which neglects to account for asymmetric uncertainties , unlike our numerical method . ] .",
    "comparing the long - term decay of near - ir and x - ray afterglow , we find the simple power - law indices remarkably consistent : @xmath35 ( x - ray ) and @xmath36 ( ir ) .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray and ir enhancements also appear to be offset from their respective quiescent levels @xmath37 at @xmath38 by nearly the same amount and , as a result , decay back to @xmath37 on similar time scales . to quantify this",
    ", we perform a @xmath31 fit to a second function consisting of a power - law with an excess offset @xmath39 , where @xmath40  days is the time since the glitch of the first ir observation , @xmath41 is the flux excess , and @xmath42 is the flux enhancement at @xmath43 .",
    "data from @xmath44 are included to determine @xmath37 .",
    "if the offsets are correlated , then we would expect the best - fit @xmath45 from x - ray and @xmath7 data to be consistent : this is in fact what we find in the latter part of table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "we note that larger errors and a small number of near - ir data points result in @xmath46 and large uncertainties on @xmath45 and @xmath21 when all three parameters are fit to the near - ir data . to confirm that the shapes of the decay curves of the x - ray and @xmath7 data are consistent statistically",
    ", we re - fit the @xmath7 data to the excess model with @xmath21 and @xmath45 fixed at the x - ray excess best - fit values .",
    "the effect of holding two parameters constant is a reasonable increase in @xmath47 to @xmath48 , showing that the two shapes are indeed consistent with each other at the 1@xmath34 level . in figure",
    "[ fig : decay ] , we plot the best - fit power laws as modelled on the x - ray and @xmath7 data ( dashed lines ) ; overplotted is the power - law plus excess model where @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( dot - dashed lines ) , and the corresponding @xmath37 best - fit value ( dotted lines ) , for comparison .",
    "thus , we find that the @xmath61  day ir and x - ray initial enhancements and subsequent decays after the 2002 outburst are correlated .",
    "in this section , we compare our results with other axps and discuss them in the context of various models .    axp optical / ir emission has been argued as originating from a fossil disk around the neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the exceptionally high x - ray to optical / ir flux ratio seen in axp 1e  2259 + 586 rendered this model problematic @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sgr - like bursting phenomena , observed in the 2002 outburst of 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite , and from 1e  1048.1@xmath55937 in 2001 @xcite and very recently in 2004 @xcite , as well as the high optical pulsed fraction seen in axp 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite , simply can not be explained by such disks .",
    "@xcite argue that the high optical pulsed fraction can be reproduced in a disk - dynamo model , although whether this could produce the observed bursts is unclear .",
    "`` hybrid '' fallback disk models , in which the disk surrounds a magnetar , have recently been proposed to attempt to explain all axp properties @xcite . in this case",
    ", the quiescent pulsed x - ray emission arises from accretion from the disk while optical pulsations and bursts are magnetar magnetospheric emission .",
    "@xcite argue , in the context of such a hybrid model , that enhanced x - ray emission , following an sgr - like flare , is released from the inner disk which has been pushed back by the burst itself . for 1e  2259 + 586 ,",
    "however , no such sgr - like flare was detected prior to the observed enhanced x - ray emission , with upper limit 3 orders of magnitude below the total observed energy release @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one axp shows uncorrelated torque and x - ray flux variations , contrary to the predictions of any fallback disk model @xcite .",
    "it is true that one natural prediction of fallback disk models is some form of correlation between the ir and x - ray emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of solutions to the problematic aspects of these models as listed above , we do not find the observed ir / x - ray correlation to render fallback disk models particularly compelling .",
    "by contrast , the magnetar model accounts very well for the bulk of axp properties , especially bursts @xcite , and qualitatively can explain optical / ir properties as well .",
    "in the magnetar model , thermal surface emission is ruled out as the energy source for axp optical / ir emission because of the impossibly high implied brightness temperature ; hence , optical / ir emission must originate in the stellar magnetosphere , regardless of what powers it .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite argued that electron / positron radiation in the magnetosphere of a magnetar , produced in analogy with that in rotation - powered pulsars , could explain the observed optical / ir properties of axps .",
    "the strong correlation between ir and x - ray flux decay that we have observed in the afterglow of the 2002 outburst of 1e  2259 + 586 argues for a physical link between the origins of both types of radiation .",
    "the x - ray emission is far too luminous ( @xmath51 in 1@xmath510  kev at a distance @xmath04  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be rotation - powered ; it follows that the ir emission is likely not either . though @xcite argued that the ir emission from an energetics standpoint could be rotation - powered , the large implied efficiency ( @xmath52 , from figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of conversion from spin - down flux into ir emission in 4u  0142 + 61 , if the latter is rotation - powered , also argues against ( though does not disprove ) this hypothesis .",
    "the post - outburst correlation does clarify , however , the origin of the x - ray afterglow following the 2002 outburst , because of the following reasoning .",
    "@xcite identified two possible mechanisms to produce the x - ray afterglow .",
    "the first was a genuine afterglow , i.e. thermal emission from the surface , a result of an impulsive heat injection to the crust from the magnetosphere .",
    "such a thermal afterglow mechanism has been invoked in sgrs , in which the impulse , namely a bright soft gamma - ray flare , was clearly observed @xcite . for 1e  2259 + 586 ,",
    "however , no such flare was seen @xcite .",
    "an alternative to this thermal afterglow model is that the enhanced x - rays are a result of a twisting of the magnetospheric field , perhaps as a result of the twisting of its footpoints following a signficant surface restructuring .",
    "such an event is consistent with the coincidental rotational glitch that was observed @xcite , since the latter clearly implies a major disturbance in the crustal superfluid .",
    "such a twisting could naturally result in enhanced x - rays @xcite , with subsequent field relaxation accounting for the decay .",
    "given that the ir enhancement can not be from surface thermal emission , the correlation with the x - ray decay strongly favors the twisting model , as it is difficult to understand how surface thermal x - ray emission could be so closely correlated with magnetospheric radiation .",
    "moreover , the ir enhancement being a result of a decaying magnetospheric disturbance is consistent with the picture suggested by @xcite and @xcite in which the ir emission is radiation from magnetospheric pairs",
    ". it would be interesting to see , in future outbursts , whether the ir emission is pulsed and/or polarized , and if so , whether the pulse morphology is similar , and changes in concert with any x - ray pulse morphological changes , as this would strongly support this scenario .",
    "ir variability over long time periods has been seen in three other axps . in the case of 1e  1048.1@xmath55937 , @xmath7-band variability has been detected @xcite .",
    "however , no variation in x - ray flux was seen between the different epochs .",
    "moreover , a more recent observation @xcite found that the ir flux was consistent with the fainter of the two previous measurements , even though the x - ray flux was significantly larger @xcite . despite showing no evidence of x - ray activity (",
    "* and unpublished work ) , 4u  0142 + 61 also appears to vary in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the physical mechanism responsible for the ir emission is distinct from that responsible for the _ quiescent _ x - rays , even during the broad x - ray flaring reported by @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the post - outburst behavior we have seen in 1e  2259 + 586 . that axp ir and x - ray emission is generally correlated following an axp outburst",
    "is further supported by the recent report of ir decay in data from the transient axp candidate xte j1810@xmath5197 @xcite following its x - ray brightening and fading in 2004 @xcite .",
    "this work was based on observations obtained at the gemini observatory ( program ids gn-2002a - dd-6 , gn-2003a - q-71 , gn-2003b - q-22 ) , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
