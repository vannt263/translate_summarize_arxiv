    "in the paradigm of cosmological structure formation , gravitationally bound halos form at the peaks of the primordial density field as dark matter and baryons undergo nonlinear gravitational collapse .",
    "dark matter , being collisionless and dissipationless , conserves its orbital energy , remaining in an extended dispersion - supported profile with overlapping inward- and outward - moving orbits @xcite .",
    "in contrast , gas collides , shocks , mixes , and eventually dissipates energy via radiative cooling , causing it to collapse to the minimum of a halo s potential well and seed the formation of stars and galaxies @xcite .    within this paradigm , debate persists about the most physically meaningful ways to describe the physical extent of a halo , the rate of cosmic accretion into a halo , and the amount of mass growth within a halo , including how these compare for dark matter versus baryons .",
    "these are important questions because measurements of cosmic accretion and mass growth depend sensitively on how and where one measures them .",
    "thus , understanding the evolution of halos requires a detailed understanding of the relevant physical scales across cosmic time , including the physical meaning ( if any ) of a choice for a halo s virial boundary / edge .",
    "furthermore , because cosmic accretion into a halo feeds the growth of the galaxy inside , understanding the physics of all of these scales is necessary for developing a physical picture of galaxy evolution in a cosmological context .",
    "many works have examined the nature of dark - matter accretion into halos .",
    "most previous works measured cosmic accretion or mass growth according to some evolving virial radius , @xmath8 , that was linked to the background density of the universe ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent works have questioned the physical meaning of the commonly used halo virial radius and its implications for inferred cosmological accretion and mass growth @xcite .",
    "specifically , these works found that low - mass halos experience little - to - no significant physical growth of dark matter at fixed physical radii , especially at late cosmic time ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "moreover , the recent work by @xcite found that most of the growth of dark - matter mass at halo masses @xmath10 arises because one measures halo mass within some virial radius that is tied to a reference background density that evolves with time , which in turn can lead to inferred growth of halo mass even if the physical density profile of the halo remains constant , an effect that they called `` pseudo - evolution '' .",
    "this suggests that there is little - to - no _ physical _ accretion into lower - mass halos at late cosmic time , such that they effectively evolve as `` island '' halos , divorced from the cosmic background , at @xmath11 .",
    "pseudo - evolution has a number of important implications for understanding phenomenological links between galaxies and dark - matter halos as well as for models of galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , observations are probing the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the virial mass of its host halo , including its evolution with time ( for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , finding that the relation between galaxy mass and halo mass evolves only weakly at @xmath12 ( and possibly at higher @xmath13 ) , which suggests that galaxy mass evolves largely in sync with halo mass .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a tight linear relation between the size of a galaxy and the size of its host halo across a wide range of masses at @xmath14 , despite the significantly varying ratio of stellar - to - halo mass across this range .",
    "these studies suggest that the mass and size of a galaxy is set by , or at least responds to , that of its host halo , but these relations are meaningful only insofar as one uses a physically sensible radius ( and thus mass ) for a halo .",
    "moreover , many ( semi - analytic ) models of galaxy evolution try to link the accretion rate of a halo in simulations to its baryonic accretion rate and in turn to the star formation rate of the galaxy ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "halo mass growth that is incorrectly attributed from pseudo - evolution would affect all of these analyses .",
    "however , it remains unclear what role pseudo - evolution plays in the cosmic accretion of baryons , because gas dynamics can be markedly different : gas is collisional , so it can shock and mix , and it also can dissipate energy via radiative cooling .",
    "a number of works have examined the accretion rates of gas into galaxies ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and halos ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though in almost all cases they measured mass growth / flux at some predefined and evolving virial radius .",
    "few works have compared in detail the specific accretion rates of gas versus dark matter : @xcite and @xcite both found that specific accretion rates near the virial radius were broadly similar for baryons and dark matter , with some ( up to a factor of 2 ) reduction in the specific rate for baryons , depending on the model for stellar winds ; but they both found significantly reduced baryon accretion rates at small radii near the galaxy compared to that near the virial radius .",
    "however , all of these works used differing techniques to measure accretion and at somewhat different choices for virial radii . furthermore , many of these works focused on the role of feedback from stars and/or black holes on baryonic accretion rates , using various phenomenological models for driving stellar winds .",
    "while there is general consensus that stellar winds can alter accretion rates into the galaxies , results are mixed regarding the regulation of gas accretion at larger radii within a halo .",
    "however , all of these works found _ some _ level of gas accretion into galaxies at late cosmic time , implying that the pseudo - evolution of dark matter may not extend to gas .",
    "indeed , @xcite , examined baryonic accretion rates in a suite of cosmological zoom - in simulations at @xmath15 and found that the mass inflow rate at @xmath16 is broadly similar to ( @xmath17 ) that at @xmath8 ; they found similar trends examining the rate at fixed physical radii of 10 and @xmath18 , implying that baryon accretion to small radii is indeed physical .",
    "more generally , the physical nature of cosmic accretion has a variety of implications for the evolution of gas in halos and galaxies at late cosmic time , especially for low - mass galaxies .",
    "for example , galaxies at @xmath19 formed @xmath20 of their mass since @xmath21 @xcite , and the rate of decline of the cosmic density of star formation broadly mimics the decline of dark - matter accretion rates into halos at fixed mass ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it is not clear how much star formation and galaxy growth at @xmath12 is linked to cosmic accretion , as opposed to the consumption of gas that already is within galaxies , given that ( molecular ) gas fractions are observed to decrease over time ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the recycling of gas in galaxies from stellar winds ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , cosmic gas accretion into halos drives the evolution of extended gas around galaxies , referred to as the circumgalactic medium , as many observations and surveys now are probing ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for such studies",
    "it is important to understand both the most physically meaningful virial definition to use for a halo as well as the rate of accretion of ( relatively unenriched ) gas and how it propagates to smaller radii .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to understand the physical nature of cosmic accretion into halos and how it propagates down to scales of the galaxy inside , for both baryons and dark matter . in particular",
    ", we aim to bridge the gap between detailed studies of halo growth , typically based on dark - matter - only simulations , and detailed studies of cosmic gas accretion into galaxies .",
    "more specifically , we seek to understand the significance of pseudo - evolution not only for dark - matter accretion , but also its role in baryon accretion and hence galaxy growth .",
    "we focus on halos of mass @xmath22 at late cosmic time ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "such halos are observed to host galaxies with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 in our simulation with star formation is @xmath26 higher because of overcooling ; see ) .",
    "these mass and redshift regimes are where the effects of pseudo - evolution are particularly strong @xcite , where observations constrain well the relation between galaxies and their host halos as well as gas in / around galaxies .",
    "we use simulations with varying treatments of gas physics , some including star formation and thermal feedback , though our simulations only marginally resolve the scales within galaxies , and our prescription for stellar feedback does not drive particularly strong winds out of galaxies , which play a strong role in regulating accretion into the galaxy itself .",
    "thus , we focus on cosmic accretion and mass growth on scales within a halo , but we do not investigate accretion into the galaxy , or stellar mass growth , directly .",
    "we defer such work to a follow - up analysis .    throughout , we cite all masses using @xmath27 for the dimensionless hubble parameter .",
    "we first review the basic theoretical framework for _ spherical _ collapse and virialization of a halo , to set the stage for and aid in the interpretation of our numerical results . in the standard model @xcite ,",
    "if a spherical region is sufficiently overdense , its gravitational self - attraction overcomes the initial cosmological expansion , such that a mass shell will reach a maximum radius and then collapse .",
    "specifically , for flat @xmath28cdm cosmology , the radial acceleration around some overdense region is @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is the physical radius from the center of the overdensity , @xmath31 is the enclosed mass , @xmath32 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath33 is the ( constant ) physical density of dark energy . around the overdense region , this acceleration counteracts the initial outward - moving velocity that is set by the hubble expansion , and if a shell experiences turn - around , it decouples from the hubble flow , at which point it no longer `` feels '' the expansion of the universe , modulo the acceleration from dark energy in .",
    "we refer to the radius of this first turn - around as @xmath34 .    in einstein - de sitter cosmology (",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , turn - around occurs when the average density within the sphere is @xmath37 that of the background . assuming the virial theorem for the equilibrium state of the halo , such that @xmath38 , for which @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the kinetic and potential energies , its final @xmath30 ( density ) will be @xmath41 that at @xmath34 . over this period of collapse",
    ", the background universe has expanded to become @xmath42 less dense , so a `` virialized '' halo has an average density of @xmath43 that of background , a value that many authors round to 200 .",
    "( see @xcite for a generalization of this model to @xmath44 . )    more generally , one can define a halo s virial radius , @xmath45 , such that the average interior density is @xmath46 times some reference density , @xmath47 : @xmath48 . in this work ,",
    "we use @xmath49 m , that is , we define halos as containing @xmath50 the average matter density of the universe .",
    "( we will compare other virial definitions in the context of the results of this paper in future work . )    while the above model describes halo collapse in terms of instantaneous energetics , the actual physics of collapse is more complicated , given that halos experience ongoing accretion , so they almost never are well - relaxed virialized systems , especially at @xmath51 .",
    "first we consider dark matter . after reaching @xmath34 , a shell continues to collapse until reaching its first pericenter , after which it orbits back out to its apocenter , or secondary turn - around radius , @xmath52 .",
    "if there were no change in @xmath53 throughout this full orbit , energy conservation implies that @xmath54 . in reality",
    ", the continued accretion of mass shells from larger @xmath30 causes the potential to deepen , so @xmath55 : the higher the accretion rate , the more that @xmath55 @xcite . throughout this orbit",
    ", a shell passes through other shells that collapsed at different times , because dark matter is collisionless .",
    "thus , a halo represents a superposition of shells of inward- and outward - moving orbits that have collapsed at different epochs . at any time",
    ", there is an outermost @xmath52 , which corresponds to the shell that is reaching its @xmath52 for the first time .",
    "we refer to this as the splashback radius , @xmath56 , and it corresponds to the maximum @xmath30 of matter that has passed through the core of the halo .",
    "thus , a halo s density profile declines rapidly beyond @xmath56 , and typically @xmath57 ; it is smaller for halos with higher rates of accretion @xcite .",
    "the physics of gas accretion is different , because gas is a collisional fluid , so there are no shell crossings of orbits , and there is no splashback radius . thus , after reaching @xmath34 , gas collapses ( typically supersonically ) until it encounters a previously collapsed gas shell , at which point it shocks and heats @xcite . thus , while gas has no splashback radius , it can have a virial - shock radius , although this can occur at @xmath30 much smaller ( or larger ) than @xmath5 , including near the galaxy itself @xcite . if shocked , gas is heated to near the halo s virial temperature , at which point it is supported by thermal pressure .",
    "if the timescale for gas cooling is longer than the dynamical time at the given radius , the gas will remain in near hydrostatic equilibrium , which typically is true at @xmath58 @xcite . in lower - mass halos , even if gas is shock - heated to near the virial temperature @xcite , it will cool rapidly and advect to smaller @xmath30 , while remaining relatively cold @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the above picture is valid for halo collapse that is purely spherical and smooth . in reality , cosmological collapse is triaxial and clumpy . for dark matter",
    ", this means that @xmath56 is smeared out ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for gas , triaxial collapse can drive turbulence with effective pressure support , and gas can mix via kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities . for both components ,",
    "angular - momentum support will regulate radial advection , and infalling satellite halos can persist as bound subhalos that behave neither purely collisional nor collisionless .",
    "thus , while the above picture is informative , it is not necessarily true in detail , and one needs to use cosmological simulations to model these processes fully , as we now describe .",
    "to study the accretion of dark matter and gas in a realistic cosmological context , we performed and analyzed a suite of cosmological simulations that we call _ `` omega25 '' _ using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) eulerian @xmath59-body plus hydrodynamics code @xcite and the _ omega _ high - performance computing cluster at yale university .",
    "these simulations include collisionless dynamics of dark matter and stars as well as gas dynamics in a cubical volume of comoving size @xmath60 in a flat @xmath28cdm cosmology : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath27 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "art uses adaptive refinement in space and time to reach the high dynamic range required to resolve galaxies and their halos in cosmological simulations .",

    "we present results only from the higher - resolution @xmath66 simulations , having used the lower - resolution simulations to ensure that our results do not depend significantly on resolution within the ranges of halo mass ( @xmath76 ) and radius ( @xmath77 ) that we examine .    in order to assess the effects of gas cooling and star formation on the dynamics of baryon accretion",
    ", we conducted each simulation with four different prescriptions for the inclusion of gas dynamics , star formation , and feedback , as follows :    1 .   including only dark matter , 2 .",
    "additionally including gas without radiative cooling , 3 .   additionally turning on radiative cooling for primordial gas in the presence of a cosmic ultraviolet background ( without star formation ) , 4 .   additionally including star formation , thermal feedback , metal enrichment , and metal - line cooling , as detailed below .",

    "baryons are continuous density fields , that cosmic accretion is triaxial and clumpy , and that halos are not fully relaxed `` virialized '' systems , any definition of a virial radius / boundary for a halo is at some level an oversimplification .",
    "that said , our results suggest that @xmath220 is the most physically meaningful radius to measure the mass growth and accretion of dark matter for halos in our mass range .",
    "additionally , beyond just the splashback of dark matter , this radius also corresponds to where a significant fraction of ( observable ) galaxies around massive groups / clusters are splashback satellite galaxies that passed through the host ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , @xmath220 is the most natural radius for comparing dark matter with baryons because this is where their average infall dynamics starts to decouple . for baryons ,",
    "their collisional and dissipational dynamics mean that there is no shell crossing ( with the exception of any gas that remains bound in massive subhalos ) , therefore there is no analogous @xmath56 . in sufficiently high - mass halos",
    ", gas can experience an analogous virial - shock radius , though this can occur at a range of radii with respect to @xmath5 , depending on mass and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "thus , we suggest that @xmath147 has many advantages over @xmath5 ( or even smaller radii ) for measuring the physically meaningful extent , and thus the cosmic accretion rate and mass growth , of halos in our mass range .",
    "nevertheless , the exact value of @xmath56 and thus @xmath114 , with respect to @xmath5 , depends on the specific accretion rate and therefore on halo mass and @xmath13 , such that @xmath56 and @xmath114 occur more typically at @xmath225 in massive galaxy clusters @xcite . in a follow - up analysis",
    ", we will examine a broader range of virial definitions to examine which best capture physical scales of density , velocity , and thermal profiles for dark matter and gas , including dependence across a more comprehensive range of halo mass and @xmath13 .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "galaxies obey tight scaling relations with their host halos , including both mass and size .",
    "this tightness over cosmic time may seem surprising in the context of the pseudo - evolution of halo mass , given that dark - matter mass and density do not change at small @xmath30 , on scales of the galaxy . however , our results provide some insights into this relation .",
    "baryons continue to cool and advect to scales of the galaxy at a rate that roughly tracks the accretion rate at @xmath125 .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath226 _ approximately _ captures the collapsed mass of the halo , which also represents the baryons available to feed the galaxy .",
    "in detail , our results imply that @xmath227 may provide a better correlation with the properties of the galaxy .",
    "if true , this means that galaxy growth at @xmath23 is at some level limited and/or regulated by cosmic accretion at @xmath228 , despite the added complexity of feedback and wind recycling .",
    "this picture is supported at least indirectly by the similarity of the decline in halo accretion rates and galaxy star - formation rates at @xmath23 ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though it requires more investigation in the context of simulations with more detailed and physically motivated feedback models .    while we have shown that the accretion / growth rates of dark matter and baryons are decoupled at small @xmath30 within a halo , our results do support the methodology of using accretion rates from dark - matter simulations to estimate baryonic accretion rates into halos , provided that this is measured at @xmath187 , or more optimally , at @xmath147 .",
    "furthermore , while the accretion rates are decoupled at small @xmath30 , they may still correlate with each other , in the sense that the halos with the highest accretion rates of dark matter may also have the highest rates for baryons .",
    "if true , this may shed light on recent `` age matching '' models that assume a tight correlation between star formation in galaxies at @xmath229 and the formation timescales ( effectively measured at high @xmath13 ) of their host halos @xcite . in future work",
    ", we will examine such correlations between rates of baryons and dark matter across cosmic time in more detail .",
    "finally , our result that gas typically becomes strongly rotationally supported at @xmath218 , independent of redshift , has interesting implications for galaxy size growth .",
    "this suggests that galactic disks are fed by torquing or viscous advection from much more extended pseudo - disks of rotationally supported gas .",
    "indeed , several analyses of cosmological zoom - in simulations of individual @xmath230 galaxies found that they had extended thick and/or warped disks of cool accreting gas out to @xmath231 and beyond @xcite .",
    "furthermore , observations of nearby galaxies show that disks of cold atomic gas often extend many times beyond the size of the stellar disk ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "if the resultant size of the galactic disk is governed by the size of the extended gaseous pseudo - disk , then this could explain the tight correlation between the observed size of a galaxy and the inferred size of its host halo as noted in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the size of the stellar disk is much smaller at @xmath232 , so such a connection requires more detailed analysis using higher - resolution simulations .",
    "our results do not change substantially in comparing simulations with only cooling to those with star formation and thermal feedback .",
    "however , we do not include more detailed radiative and/or momentum feedback , so our simulations do not drive strong galactic outflows that are encapsulated in recent high - resolution simulations with more detailed treatments ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle",
    ", strong stellar winds could suppress gas accretion rates below what we find in this work .",
    "@xcite examined cosmic accretion rates into halos in cosmological simulations using models for stellar and black - hole feedback in which winds are driven at a variety of fixed values for gas particle velocities , finding that the specific accretion rates into halos were broadly similar for baryons and dark matter , and that their feedback models change baryonic accretion rates only slightly for halos @xmath233 , though feedback yielded stronger reduction in gas accretion rates at smaller @xmath30 . using a different implementation of fixed - velocity wind models in a cosmological simulation , @xcite found that winds can reduce the rates of infalling gas , particularly in low - mass halos , by up to a factor of 2 for their strongest wind model , again with stronger reduction at smaller @xmath30 .",
    "more recently , @xcite used a combination of delayed cooling supernova and early stellar feedback in a handful of cosmological zoom - in halos of mass @xmath234 at @xmath70 , finding that gas accretion rates into halos did not change with their feedback implementation .",
    "similarly , @xcite examined gas accretion rates in cosmological simulations that generate galactic winds at a velocity that scales with the local velocity dispersion of dark matter , with additional thermal and ionizing feedback from black holes , and found that feedback reduced gas accretion rates only slightly at @xmath8 as compared with no feedback , but that feedback increased the gas inflow rates at @xmath235 as a result recycling from the winds .",
    "overall , these works suggest that galactic winds do not substantially affect baryonic accretion rates at and beyond @xmath5 but that they do drive gas recycling that modulates inflow / outflow rates near the core of the halo .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear how much galactic winds , launched from the galaxy with a low impact parameter and thus a low angular momentum , would change the angular - momentum distribution of extended halo gas .",
    "however , we emphasize that almost all previous works examined winds with phenomenologically tuned prescriptions for wind velocities and its coupling ( or lack thereof ) with the surrounding halo gas .",
    "such analyses should be revisited with more realistic and comprehensive treatments of stellar feedback @xcite .",
