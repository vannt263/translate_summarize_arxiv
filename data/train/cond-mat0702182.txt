    "behavior of many natural systems in contact with their surroundings can be described within a stochastic picture based on langevin equations .",
    "the basic equation of this type reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the deterministic `` force '' representing the internal dynamics of the system and @xmath3 is the `` noise '' describing its interaction with its complex surrounding ( heat bath ) . in many cases",
    "this noise can be considered as white and gaussian , giving rise to the classical langevin approach used in the analysis of brownian motion .",
    "the whiteness of the noise ( lack of temporal correlations ) corresponds to the existence of time - scale separation between the dynamics of a relevant variable of interest @xmath4 and the typical timescale of the noise .",
    "white noise can be thus considered as a standard stochastic process that describes in the simplest fashion the effects of `` fast '' surrounding . on the other hand , the gaussian nature of the noise",
    "is usually guaranteed by assuming the surrounding bath being composed of many practically independent subsystems and by the fact that the interaction of @xmath5 with each of these subsystems is bounded .",
    "the first assumption allows for considering the noise as being a sum of many independent random contributions ( in thermodynamical limit  infinitely many ) , which mathematically corresponds to the statement that its probability distribution is infinitely divisible and stable .",
    "the second assumption chooses the gaussian distribution as the only one possessing finite dispersion .",
    "however , the assumption that the perturbations in the system s dynamics due to interactions with bath are described by white gaussian noise is not always appropriate when describing real processes where each of the assumptions concerning the noise ( e.g. its whiteness or its gaussian distribution ) can be violated . in various phenomena in physics , chemistry or biology @xcite",
    "the noise can be still interpreted as white ( i.e. , with stationary , independent increments ) and distributed according to a stable and infinitely divisible law , however , the distribution of the noise variable @xmath6 is registered as following not a gaussian , but rather a more general , lvy probability distribution .",
    "such situations were addressed for example in refs .",
    "the present work discusses some further properties of lvy flights in external potentials with a focus on astonishing aspects of noise - induced bifurcations and explores in more detail features of stationary states in langevin systems under the influence of asymmetric lvy noises .",

    "we have investigated the dynamic stochastic process modeled by the ( overdamped ) langevin equation of the form @xmath121 where : @xmath5  is a position of the particle , @xmath122  stands for a friction coefficient , @xmath123  is particle s mass , @xmath124 ( @xmath16 )  represents strength of the noise and @xmath3  is lvy stable white noise characterized by the stability index @xmath0 ( @xmath13 $ ] ) and the asymmetry parameter @xmath20 ( @xmath17 $ ] ) .",
    "the force acting on a particle is determined by the external potential , @xmath125 .",

    "the lvy white noise is equivalent to the gaussian white noise and it has standards units , i.e. @xmath133=[\\xi(t)]=1/\\sqrt{[t]}$ ] .    by the set of transformation : @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "( [ eq : langlwn ] ) can be transformed to the dimensionless form @xmath136 which is of the same type like eq .",
