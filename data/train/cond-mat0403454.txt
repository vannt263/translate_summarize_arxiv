    "the current - carrying ability of superconductors has been long debated since practical applications became viable .",

    "the field operational range of the meissner state is usually too small and super - currents too weak to satisfy practical needs .",
    "hence an enormous effort has been made to find ways to reinforce the vortex pinning , which determines the maximum dissipation - free currents in the superconductors in the shubnikov state .",
    "an additional method for further enhancing the current - carrying ability of superconducting strips was suggested in a series of recent theoretical works by genenko _",

    "up to @xmath32 all the magnetic energy within the volume of the wire is spent on alignment of magnetic domains inside the iron sheath and no energy is left to affect the superconductivity in the core . in other words , due to a magnetic permeability of the sheath a magnetic shielding effect occurs .",
    "the shielding in similar samples has been visualized in ref .",
    "@xcite with the help of magneto - optical imaging .",
    "note that in the zfc curve of the shielded wire the meissner state is shifted to a higher field , compared to the corresponding bare wire curve , by approximately 0.34  t. therefore , the experimental first pseudo critical field @xmath34 for the shielded wire can be defined as @xmath35 the shift enables the first critical field @xmath36  t in mgb@xmath0 superconductor to be exceeded by a factor of @xmath37 .    to the second category of the @xmath38-dependent effects we can attribute the following features observed in fig .",
    "[ prp ] : + ( 1 ) a clear overcritical state is observed at @xmath39  k. this phenomenon is the most striking among all the observed effects . by the overcritical state here",
    "we imply that the maximum width of the hysteresis loops of the sheathed wire is always larger than the corresponding width of the magnetization in the bare wire .",
    "the width of the loops is well known to be directly proportional to the critical current density @xmath40 . + ( 2 )",
    "a suppression of the superconductivity occurs at @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the field at which the overcritical state vanishes , i.e. , the ascending branch of the sheathed wire crosses the corresponding branch of the bare wire ( see fig .",
    "[ prp ] for @xmath43 definition ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the irreversibility field of the sheathed wire is smaller than that of the bare wire at all temperatures ( see fig .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the zero - field cooled ( virgin ) magnetization curve of the fe - sheathed wire in increasing magnetic field is only shifted due to the iron screening effect , but its magnetization value in the minimum is comparable to the corresponding value of the bare wire , unlike the fc ascending branch case described in ( 1 ) .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the fc branches of the sheathed wire experience a strong magnetic history dependence .",
    "in contrast to the magnetization behavior of the bare wire , the ascending branch has much higher absolute values of the magnetization compared to those of the descending branch at all temperatures .",
    "+ ( 6 ) the thermo - magnetic flux - jump instabilities in the sheathed wire appear over a wider field range and at higher temperatures than in the bare wire .",
    "the curves shown in fig .  [ prl ] exhibit magnetization behavior measured with the magnetic field applied parallel to the cylindrical axis of the wire at different temperatures . apart from the orientation , the measurement conditions for the curves in each graph are identical with the corresponding conditions for the transverse orientation .",
    "however , one can clearly see significant discrepancies between the magnetization behaviors obtained for these two orientations ( figs .",
    "[ prp ] and [ prl ] ) .",
    "the temperature independent effect of magnetic screening is still there due to the finite length of the sample , although it is far from being so prominent as in the transverse orientation .",
    "the saturation field of the ferromagnetic iron sheath @xmath44  t for the longitudinal orientation is much smaller than in the transverse case .",
    "therefore , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ bc1 ] ) , @xmath45 .",
    "this magnetic anisotropy of @xmath11 is likely to be a consequence of the mechanical deformation process during the wire fabrication .",
    "structurally , the process most probably elongates the iron grains in the sheath in the direction of drawing .",
    "magnetically , the structural strains developed in the sheath during the mechanical deformation force the magnetization easy - axis of the iron to be parallel to the cylindrical axis of the wire .",
    "irreversibility fields for the sheathed and bare wires in the parallel and perpendicular orientations . due to the maximum field limitation of the squid magnetometer , the values of @xmath24 exceeding 5  t could not be reached .",
    "this is shown by the dotted line for the bare wire at @xmath21  k. ]    as to the temperature - dependent effects , which arise due to the interaction between the magnetic sheath and the superconducting core , we point out the following peculiarities inherent to the field applied parallel to the wire ( fig .  [ prl ] ) : + ( 1 ) no overcritical state is observed .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the superconducting signal of the fe - sheathed wire is suppressed compared to the signal of the bare wire over the entire field range .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the irreversibility fields are smaller not only than in the bare wire , but also than in the case of the perpendicular orientation ( fig .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the virgin curve behavior is similar to that described in case ( 4 ) of the transverse orientation .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the magnetic history dependent effect is similar to that described in ( 5 ) for the transverse case .",

    "the temperature independent case of the iron screening effect is rather straightforward for both field orientations , and it has been described and visualized in our previous work @xcite . in this work , we deal with the temperature - dependent phenomena which arise from the interaction between the sheath and the superconducting core .",
    "the most scientifically interesting and practically important effect obtained in this work is the overcritical state observed in the case of the applied field perpendicular to the sheathed wire axis ( fig .",
    "[ prp ] ) . in general , the existence of the overcritical state as a result of an interaction between a superconducting _ strip _ and a soft magnetic environment was predicted in ref .  .",
    "the main idea is that for some environment configurations the super - current profile over the strip can be redistributed so that the super - current is pushed from the flux - filled strip edges to the central flux - free part of the strip , resulting in a total overcritical current @xmath46 .",
    "the most pronounced enhancement of the current was found for an open convex magnetic cavity .",
    "the cylindrical cavity was shown to be a less favorable configuration for a current enhancing redistribution .",
    "note that in our case the core is situated inside a cylindrical cavity ( see fig .",
    "[ sem](a ) ) .",
    "it was further shown @xcite that if a strip is squeezed between two parallel magnets , forming a  sandwich \"- like configuration , it can lead to a significant _ undesirable _ current enhancement at the strip edges .",
    "the enhancement at the edges would eventually lead to an overall @xmath5 degradation in the strip , which eliminates any possibility for the occurrence of an overcritical state . in our case",
    ", the sheath can also be considered to be parallel to the core in the vicinity of points a and b ( see fig .  [ sem](c ) ) .",
    "the super - current redistribution is possible in the strips since the meissner shielding currents can flow over the entire surface of the thin superconductor @xcite . the only controversial experimental indication for the occurrence of the overcritical state occurrence in strips has been recently reported for yba@xmath0cu@xmath47o@xmath48 films by employing the magneto - optical imaging technique @xcite .",
    "overcritical meissner currents were locally obtained by inversion of the biot - savart law in the region next to magnets set perpendicular to the film but not on the middle of the film which contradicts to the theoretical prediction @xcite . moreover , no global investigations , such as magnetization or transport measurements , have been carried out .",
    "indeed , the geometrical configuration for which the overcritical state was predicted to exist in strips is extremely difficult to realize in practice .",

    "the flux - free meissner state is physically important condition for overcritical currents to exist . nevertheless , in spite of being bulk - like , having direct contact with parallel magnets and carrying out our experiments on the wires in fc state we are able to clearly show that the overcritical state does exist in the wires ( fig .",

    "no real @xmath52 at @xmath57 is available in the case of magnetic measurements .    to explain the overcritical state developing in a round wire confined in a cylindrical magnetic environment ( fe - sheath ) we have constructed a phenomenological model which can be described with the help of the schematic in fig .",
    "[ sem](c ) . in the case of the field applied perpendicular to the wire axis we assume that meissner shielding currents flow within quasi two - dimensional planes .",
    "the wire can then be considered as a stack of strips tightly packed in the cylindrical cavity .",

    "( [ max ] ) the @xmath67-ratio is independent of temperature . this independence is also observed in our experiment at temperatures below 30  k ( fig .  [ oc ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath40 enhancement below @xmath68  k which is overshadowed by the flux - jump instabilities is expected to remain constant as shown by the dotted line in fig .",

    "this is also in agreement with the prediction in ref .",
    "in fact , @xmath40 of the bare wire is higher than that of the sheathed wire ( fig .",
    "[ jc](b ) ) , which might be associated with the local suppression of the superconductivity by the magnetic material .",
    "the difference between perpendicular and parallel field orientation is a strong support in favor of the super - current redistribution from edges ( of the strips depicted in fig .",
    "[ sem](c ) ) towards the central area of the superconducting core .",
    "a further support of such the redistribution has recently been provided by magneto - optical ( mo ) imaging @xcite .",
    "the modified flux profile induced by the transport super - current interaction with the externally magnetized sheath has been visualized within the mgb@xmath0 core of the fe - sheathed wire in a similar way as it was done in ref .  . the observed flux profile within the core was compatible with the unusual enhancement of the super - current in the middle of the core @xcite",
    "this effect was observed only in the case of the wire cooled in an externally applied field ( fc state ) .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting that recent theoretical results have shown that in a bulk round superconductor wire placed in a semi - infinite cylindrical magnet the sheet currents in the meissner state can be enhanced as a result of redistribution from the edges towards the center of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "a magnetic history - dependent effect with a strongly pronounced asymmetry between the fc ascending and descending branches of the magnetization is observed in the sheathed wires for both field orientations ( figs .",
    "[ prp ] and [ prl ] ) .",
    "this asymmetry arises due to the interplay between the irreversibility induced by pinning and the sheath permeability .",
    "indeed , the ascending branch always exhibits much higher values of the magnetization compared to the descending branch .",
    "for example , at @xmath68  k the maximum absolute value of the ascending branch at @xmath72  t is higher than the corresponding value of the descending branch by a factor of @xmath73 for the transverse case ( fig .",
    "[ prp ] ) .",
    "this factor decreases with increasing temperature , whereas the maximum value of the descending branch remains almost constant . at lower temperatures",
    ", one can anticipate the maximum value of the ascending branch to be even higher and the difference between the branches even larger , but the magnetization behavior is strongly overshadowed by the thermo - magnetic flux - jump instabilities .",
    "thus , the ascending branch behavior is attributable to the superconducting properties , whereas the behavior of the descending branch is basically controlled by the magnetized sheath .",
    "note that the signal of the descending branch is comparable for both field orientations .",
    "the influence of the sheath magnetization also becomes dominating for the ascending branches above @xmath42 .",
    "eventually , the suppression of the superconductivity by the magnetized sheath leads to significantly smaller values of the irreversibility fields compared to the bare wires ( fig .",
    "[ b ] ) .      as mentioned above and",
    "clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ prp ] and [ prl ] , the virgin zfc magnetization curves for the sheathed wire are shifted by @xmath74 with respect to the corresponding curves for the bare wire over the entire temperature range .",
    "the interval of zero - magnetization signal arising from the magnetic screening effect @xcite is referred to as the extended @xcite or pseudo - meissner effect @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that in the case of the transverse field the absolute value of the magnetization at its minimum reproduces the corresponding value obtained for the bare wire ( fig .",
    "[ prp ] , see @xmath75  k ) .",
    "no magnetization enhancement is observed , in contrast to the fc ascending branch discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "this implies that as long as no frozen flux is present in the superconducting core , no enhancement takes place .",
    "this is because miessner shielding currents are induced in the sheathed core only within the field penetration depth at @xmath76 . in other words ,",
    "if no flux is frozen in the core , no super - currents are present inside the bulk of the core in agreement with the maxwell equations .",
    "this means that no super - current redistribution is possible .",
    "therefore , the model proposed in the previous subsection for the explanation of the overcritical state explanation is valid only for a superconductor _ filled _ with magnetic flux .",
    "this conclusion is also in agreement with the results of the recent mo experiments @xcite mentioned in the previous subsection",
    ". the flux density in the center of the core should be rather diluted just above @xmath32 upon increasing the field from @xmath18  t in the fc state .",
    "this diluted flux can enable the super - current redistribution as predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite for the meissner state . however , a further investigation has to be done in order to understand how the presence of the flux in the superconductor comply with the theory .    in the case of the longitudinal field ( fig .",
    "[ prl ] ) the value of the magnetization minimum in the virgin curves of the sheathed wire is significantly suppressed .",
    "this can also be explained by suppression of the superconductivity by the magnetic sheath .",
    "this would agree with the general explanation for the magnetization behavior at this orientation discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "as we have already mentioned previously @xcite , for mgb@xmath0 wires prepared by the _ in - situ _ method the presence of the iron sheath leads to strong thermo - magnetic flux - jump instabilities @xcite . indeed , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ prp ] , the flux - jumps appear for the fe - sheathed wire at @xmath77  k , whereas for the bare wire the flux - jumps are absent at @xmath68  k. moreover , the flux - jumps in the fe - sheathed wire extend over a much broader field range than in the bare wire at @xmath78  k. in the case of the field applied parallel to the wire axis , the differences between flux - jump behaviors of the sheathed and bare wires are present , as well ( fig .  [ prl ] for @xmath77  k ) .",
    "generally , the low thermal conductivity of the iron sheath worsens the thermal sink environment of the superconductor , compared to the environment of the steady cold helium gas flow around the bare core . as a consequence ,",
    "the sheathed system is more sensitive to local overheating due to vortex avalanches @xcite .",
    "sheath materials , such as copper and silver , which could stabilize the wires @xcite , have been shown to be too soft to support an acceptable level of critical currents and were chemically incompatible with the _ in - situ _",
    "mgb@xmath0 core preparation @xcite .    furthermore , taking into account the fact that the overcritical state produces @xmath52 which is significantly higher than @xmath40 in the bare wires",
    ", one can presume that a stronger pronounced flux - jump behavior in the sheathed wires might also be a result of an interplay between a worsened heat sink environment and the higher @xmath52 induced by the sheath .",
    "generally , the higher @xmath40 , the wider is the field range for the instabilities @xcite .",
    "hence , one might expect a stronger pronounced flux - jump behavior over a wider field range for the wire in a perpendicular field with @xmath79 of the wire in a parallel field .",
    "in fact , the flux - jump behavior is quite similar for both orientations ( figs .",
    "[ prp ] and [ prl ] ) .",
    "this fact might indicate that the meissner shielding super - currents near the core surface are similar for both orientations .",
    "therefore , the condition for the flux - jump appearance , basically given by local violation of the ampere s law @xmath80 ( where @xmath17 is the permeability of the free space and @xmath81 is the coordinate along the flux gradient ) , would be controlled by the shielding @xmath40 near the surface , but not by @xmath52 which is achieved in the bulk of the flux - filled core as a result of the super - current redistribution in the perpendicular fields .",
    "in summary , we showed that an overcritical current state exists in round superconducting mgb@xmath0 wires sheathed in iron with @xmath79 by one order of magnitude at temperatures close to @xmath9 . at lower temperatures the enhancement is temperature independent with @xmath82 .",
    "a phenomenological model valid for a round core filled with magnetic flux has been proposed which uncovers analogies between overcritical states in the round wires investigated in this work and in the strips treated theoretically in refs .  .",
    "( i ) the experimental temperature independence of @xmath67 below @xmath83 , ( ii ) the overcritical current density estimation with the help of eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) , ( iii ) the magnetic history dependence of the magnetization for zfc and fc states and ( iv ) particularly absence of the overcritical state for the parallel field orientation are the main points which indicate that the origin of the overcritical state existence in the fe - sheathed bulk wires is similar to that predicted for the thin strips .",
    "the overcritical state has been accounted for as a result of magnetic interactions between the permeable iron sheath and the superconducting core .",
    "these interactions in perpendicular fields can lead to the redistribution of super - currents within the flux - filled superconducting core , resulting in the appearance of the overcritical state .",
    "we anticipate that the effects observed should be present not only for the fe - mgb@xmath0 sheath - core wire system investigated , but also for any kind of compatible wire composition comprising a superconducting round core and a soft magnetic sheath material .",
    "the interaction of the iron sheath and superconductor has also been shown to lead to suppression of the superconductivity , in particular to degradation of the irreversibility field , in the cases when the sheath is fully magnetized .",
    "the effect of flux - jump instabilities is shown to be significantly enhanced by the fe - sheath .",
    "similar flux - jump behaviors in the sheathed wires for both orientations can suggest that @xmath40 near the surface of the core is of a similar value for both cases . this would again indicate that the overcritical currents , in the case of a transverse applied field , are achieved in the bulk of the superconducting core .    we would like to thank t. silver for careful reading of the manuscript and valuable critical remarks , as well as e. w. collings , hyper tech research inc , and alphatech ltd for support .",
