    "blazars belong to the extreme class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) hosting a relativistic jet which is pointed close to the line of sight from the earth .",
    "the blazar emission originating from the jet is observed to be highly variable over all accessible energy bands .",
    "the radiation from blazars is dominated by non - thermal emission that spans over the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to very high energy ( vhe , e@xmath1100 gev ) @xmath0rays .",
    "the multi - wavelength radiation observed from blazars is best understood in a paradigm where the emission results from the magnetized plasma ejected with relativistic speeds in a collimated outflow powered by a super massive black hole .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is characterized by two distinct and broad peaks located in the uv / optical / x - ray and in high energy ( he ,",
    "e@xmath1100 mev ) @xmath0ray regimes respectively .",
    "the low energy component is believed to be originated due to synchrotron radiation from a population of relativistic electrons losing energy in the jet magnetic field .",
    "however , the origin of second component peaking in he @xmath0ray regime , is poorly understood and is still under debate . in leptonic models , this emission originates from the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of ambient photons by the same electrons that emit the synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the ambient photon field can be synchrotron radiation in the emission region or the photons external to the jet .",
    "in synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) model , only local synchrotron photons serve as seed photons for ic scattering @xcite ; whereas , in external compton ( ec ) models , the target photon fields can be direct accretion disk field @xcite , the line emission from the broad line emitting region and ir radiation from dusty torus @xcite . on the other hand , in hadronic models , hadronic processes such as proton synchrotron and radiation produced by secondary particles are suggested to explain the emission of he and vhe @xmath0ray radiation from blazars @xcite .",
    "although , the broad band spectral properties are nearly similar in all blazars , they are further classified into two main subclasses namely bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , on the basis of their optical line features @xcite .",
    "fsrqs display strong , broad optical absorption / emission lines while bl lacs are characterized by featureless continuum showing weak / no emission / absorption lines . according to the _ blazar simplified view _ , bl lacs and fsrqs are explained as low excitation radio galaxies ( fanaroff - riley i ) and high excitation ( fanaroff - riley ii ) radio galaxies with their jets forming a small angle with respect to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the complex observational properties of blazars from the surveys carried out so far in the radio and x - ray energy bands . besides this ,",
    "the characteristic peak frequencies of synchrotron and ic components of blazar sed are anti - correlated with respect to bolometric luminosity @xcite , leading to further classification of blazars . based on the peak frequency ( @xmath2 ) of the synchrotron component ,",
    "blazars are divided into three classes : low - synchrotron peaked ( lsp : @xmath3 hz ) , intermediate - synchrotron peaked ( isp : @xmath4 hz ) and high - synchrotron peaked ( hsp : @xmath5 hz ) blazars @xcite .",
    "almost all fsrqs detected so far belong to the lsp class of blazars whereas bl lacs include lsp , isp and hsp blazars .",
    "the ratio of peak frequencies of x - ray and @xmath0ray components gives an idea about the characteristic cooling energy of relativistic particles in the jet plasma under the assumption that the emission region is homogeneous in these energy regimes .",
    "recent multi - wavelength observations of 42 radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 ( rlnls1 ) galaxies have revealed similarities between blazars and these peculiar systems @xcite .",
    "detection of @xmath0ray emission from rlnls1 galaxies have strong implications for the presence of blazar - like jets in these objects @xcite .",
    "the main differences between blazars and rlnls1s are in the masses of central engines and accretion rates .",
    "the blazars generally have larger masses and lower accretion rates whereas @xmath0ray emitting rlnls1s have small masses and high accretion rates @xcite . although rlnls1s display some peculiar differences with respect to blazars , the physical properties inferred from observations indicate that these sources are low mass tail of blazars .",
    "therefore , blazars and rlnls1s can be considered as similar objects and the differences in their observed seds are attributed to thier masses and accretion rates under the assumption that relativistic jets are formed independently of the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the multi - wavelength emission from blazars is also characterized by rapid variability on various time scales ranging from few minutes to years .",
    "based on these time scales , the variability of blazars is classified in three groups namely intra day , short time and long time . the intra day variability ( idv )",
    "implies time scales from few tens of minutes to less than a day @xcite and it is also known as micro or intra night variability .",
    "the short time variability ( stv ) is characterized by time scales from several days to few months whereas long time variability ( ltv ) covers changes from several months to many years @xcite .",
    "the shortest variability time scales from blazar light curves can be used to constrain the size of the emission region through light travel time effects , which inturn probes the location of the emission zone in the self - similar jets .",
    "mrk 421 ( z=0.031 , 134 mpc ) , an hsp type bl lac object , was first detected at energies above 100 mev by egret telescope on the compton observatory @xcite .",
    "the source is also the first extragalactic object observed by ground based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) at energies in the vhe regime @xcite .",
    "mrk 421 has been observed to be a very active blazar with major outbursts about once every year in both x - ray and @xmath0ray energy bands with variability time scales from minutes to several days @xcite . in february 2010 , this source was detected in a state of high activity reaching its maximum around february 16 , 2010 . during this outburst ,",
    "the source was the target of a multi - wavelength campaign involving x - ray satellites , @xmath0ray satellites , ground based vhe instruments , optical and radio telescopes .",
    "near simultaneous multi - wavelength data from radio to tev @xmath0rays collected during the campaign have been used to perform an extensive study of the source during this flaring activity @xcite .",
    "x - ray and he @xmath0ray observations of the same flare with _ swift _ and _ fermi _ satellites have also been studied separately @xcite .",
    "two x - ray flares from mrk 421 detected around the same period with _ maxi _ satellite during january and february 2010 are also reported @xcite .",
    "the vhe observations of the source during this flare have also been reported by various iact groups like veritas @xcite , hess @xcite and tactic @xcite .",
    "long term vhe observations of the source during 200910 with tactic have also been reported @xcite .",
    "recently , zheng et al.(2014 ) have studied the february 2010 outburst of mrk 421 considering stochastic acceleration of electrons under strong magnetic turbulences @xcite .",
    "they studied the flare assuming different indices of the turbulent spectrum and conclude that the observed properties of the flare favour the turbulent index to be @xmath6 2 ( hard sphere approximation ) .",
    "yan et al.(2013 ) have investigated the electron energy distribution and acceleration processes in the jet of mrk 421 through sed fitting in different active states under the framework of one zone ssc model @xcite .",
    "they assume two electron energy distributions formed via different acceleration processes : the shock accelerated power law with exponential cut - off and the stochastic turbulence accelerated log - parabolic distributions to model the sed of the source .",
    "their results indicate that both the electron energy distributions give good fits for the sed in low state , but log - parabolic distribution gives better fits for the sed in high or flaring state and the vhe variability can be accomodated only in log - parabolic model . the x - ray and tev variability of mrk 421 flare observed during march 2001",
    "have been investigated by @xcite in leptohadronic single zone model .",
    "they find that @xmath0ray emission can be attributed to the synchrotron radiation either from protons or from secondary leptons produced via photohadronic processes .",
    "these possibilities also imply differences in the variability signatures in x - ray and @xmath0ray regime .",
    "chen et al . (",
    "2011 ) have reported a time dependent simulation of multi - wavelength variability of mrk 421 with a monte carlo multizone radiative transfer code @xcite .",
    "the variability in this code is introduced by the injection of relativistic electrons as a shock front crosses the emission region .",
    "the emission is considered to originate from two components : a flaring or active and a quasi - steady state .",
    "the later one is completely independent of the former component .    in the present work ,",
    "we use well sampled x - ray and @xmath0ray daily light curves to investigate the temporal properties of mrk 421 during the flare in february 2010 .",
    "we show that a time dependent power law injection of electrons in the emission region can be used to understand the outburst of the source in different energy bands within the framework of ssc model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the details of optical , x - ray and @xmath0ray data used in this study . in section 3 , we perform the temporal and correlation study of the daily light curves .",
    "modelling of x - ray and @xmath0ray light curves using time dependent injection of particles is described in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "@xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is adapted in the present work .",
    "in february 2010 , mrk 421 went into a state of high activity with maximum flux detected around february 16 , 2010 ( mjd 55243 ) in x - ray and @xmath0ray energy bands .",
    "many instruments world wide have detected this outburst .",
    "the near simultaneous multi - wavelength observations during the period february 10 - 23 , 2010 ( mjd 55237 - 55250 ) have been used in the present study .",
    "we have obtained the v - band optical data from the _ spol _ observations at steward observatory , university of arizona under _ fermi _ multi - wavelength blazar observing support program .",
    "the soft x - ray data in the energy range 0.3 - 10 kev from x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard the _ swift _ satellite @xcite have been processed with the _ xrtdas _ software package ( v.3.0.0 ) available within _ heasoft _ package ( 6.16 ) .",

    "we have obtained the daily light curve from _ maxi _ available online from its website .",
    "the @xmath0ray observations in he and vhe bands have been used from _ fermi_-large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite and tev atmospheric cherenkov telescope with imaging camera _ ( tactic ) _ @xcite observations of mrk 421 during february 10 - 23 , 2010 respectively .",
    "the he measurements from _ fermi_-lat over the energy range 0.1 - 100 gev are obtained by analysing the data using standard _ fermi_-sciencetools .",
    "the details of data analysis procedure for generating the daily light curve in he band with _",
    "fermi_-lat are discussed in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the one day averaged vhe light curve in the energy range 1.1 - 12 tev is obtained from _ tactic _ observations of the source during the above mentioned period .",
    "the procedure for analysis of _ tactic _ data used in this work has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the vhe flux points have been corrected for extragalactic background light ( ebl ) absoprtion of tev photons using the model proposed by @xcite . the intrinsic vhe light curve obtained with _ tactic _ indicates a strong flaring activity on february 16 , 2010 ( mjd 55243 ) which is also observed in x - ray and he @xmath0ray bands .",
    "the resulting @xmath0ray , x - ray and optical daily averaged light curves observed by different instruments during february 10 - 23 , 2010 ( mjd 55237 - 55250 ) are shown in figure [ fig : fig1](a - e ) . a significant enhancement of the flux in all energy bands is observed on february 16 , 2010 ( mjd 55243 ) . to study the nature of this flare in detail",

    "the best fit values of these parameters for different energy bands are presented in table [ tab : table1 ] .    the peak flux point observed with _",
    "swift_-xrt appears delayed by about one day with respect to _ maxi _ , _ lat _ and _ tactic _ bservations .",
    "it is important to note here that the xrt data is of very short duration ( less than an hour ) while the data from other instruments are averaged over a day . also _",
    "observations show a sharp drop just after the flare , which is not observed in other energy bands .",
    "almost similar rise times in all the light curves suggest that the physical process involved in the flare is energy independent . likewise ,",
    "almost similar decay times in all energy bands do not favour the flare decay due to radiative loss mechanism @xcite .",
    "the fitted light curves for four energy bands are shown in figure [ fig : fig1](a - d ) as dotted ( magenta ) lines .",
    "it is quite evident from the figure [ fig : fig1](a - d ) that the flare is asymmetric with fast rise and slow decay .",
    "we observe that the optical light curve with a high flux point on february 13 , 2010 ( mjd 55240 ) is different from the light curves in other energy bands .",
    "in addition , the features in optical light curve are not coincident with those in x - ray and @xmath0ray light curves because the optical emission appears to be in high state even before the beginning of the flare .",
    "these differences suggest that the optical emission may not be associated with the region responsible for emission in higher energy bands @xcite .",
    "this claim is further strengthened by the spectral behaviour of the broadband sed during flare maximum ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) where , the synchrotron spectral component significantly underpredicts the observed optical flux . due to these reasons",

    "in this work , we have performed a detailed temporal study of x - ray and @xmath0ray observations on mrk 421 during the flare in february 2010 to understand the flaring behaviour of the source .",
    "we determine the rise and decay characteristic timescales in the daily light curves of the source in four energy bands : 0.3 - 10 kev , 10 - 20 kev , 0.1 - 100 gev and 1.1 - 12 tev .",
    "the flux points in light curves before and after the flare are fitted with exponential rise and decay profiles respectively .",
    "we obtain almost similar rise time in all the energy bands and this indicates an energy independent physical process operating in the source during the flaring activity .",
    "also , similar characteristic decay times in different energy bands do not support the radiative loss processes involved in the decay of the flare .",
    "based on these studies , we interpret the flare to be a result of enhanced relativistic particle distribution by a putative acceleration process and the emission in the @xmath0ray energy regime to be dominated by ssc process .",
    "in addition , a strong correlation observed between x - ray and tev fluxes during the flare supports ssc interpretation of vhe emission .    to further understand the behaviour of the source during the flare , the x - ray and @xmath0ray light curves",
    "are reproduced using a time dependent model .",
    "the evolution of particle distribution in the cooling region is obtained by solving the relevant kinetic equation considering synchrotron and ssc emission processes .",
    "the evolution of radiation flux can reproduce the observed daily light curves in x ",
    "rays and @xmath0rays satisfactorily .",
    "the reproduction is better for the @xmath0ray light curves than the x - ray ones though the uncertainties in the former are relatively large .",
    "the variability in optical v - band is not significant as compared to x - ray and @xmath0ray bands and small variations in the flux level may be due to contamination from the host galaxy .",
    "we correct the optical data for starlight contribution from the host galaxy using the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "the effect of contamination from host galaxy of mrk 421 on v - magnitude in our present study is obtained to be negligible .",
    "the optical emission during the flare is probably not related to that in x - ray and @xmath0ray energy bands and it is consistent with the results from previous studies of mrk 421 @xcite . in our simplistic model",
    ", we attribute the entire flare to the varying particle injection into the emission region . however , this may not be strictly true in a realistic scenario where the flare can be associated with variation in other parameters as well , for example magnetic field , bulk lorentz factor etc .",
    "reproduction of the light curves can be improved by evolving other parameters along with the particle density .",
    "nonetheless , this will lead to the increased number of parameters and a reasonable conclusion on the physical condition responsible for the flare can not be derived .",
    "again , we have not considered the light travel time effects @xcite since the flare time scale at the source frame ( @xmath18 ) is larger than the light travel time . for instance",
    "considering a flare time scale ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath6 1 day in observer frame , the corresponding time in source frame will be @xmath2018 days ; whereas the light travel time will be @xmath213 days . hence , this effect will not be significant in our simple phenomenological model .",
