    "<S> in a central nucleus - nucleus collision at high - energies , medium partons kicked by a near - side jet acquire a momentum along the jet direction and subsequently materialize as the observed ridge particles . </S>",
    "<S> they carry direct information on the early parton momentum distribution which can be extracted by using the ridge data for central auau collisions at @xmath0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted parton momentum distribution has a thermal - like transverse momentum distribution but a non - gaussian , relatively flat rapidity distribution at mid - rapidity with sharp kinematic boundaries at large rapidities that depend on the transverse momentum .    in central high - energy heavy - ion collisions , </S>",
    "<S> the state of the parton medium during the early stage of a nucleus - nucleus collision is an important physical quantity . </S>",
    "<S> it furnishes information for the investigation of the mechanism of parton production in the early stages of the collision of two heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides the initial data for the evolution of the system toward the state of quark - gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> not much is know about the early state of the partons from direct experimental measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the star collaboration observed a @xmath1-@xmath2 correlation of particles associated with a near - side jet in central auau collisions at @xmath0 gev at rhic , where @xmath1 and @xmath3 are the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity differences relative to a high-@xmath4 trigger particle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the near - side correlations can be decomposed into a `` jet '' component with fragmentation and radiation products at @xmath5@xmath6(0,0 ) , and a `` ridge '' component at @xmath7@xmath80 with a ridge structure in @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> while many theoretical models have been proposed @xcite , a momentum kick model was presented to describe the ridge phenomenon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model assumes that a near - side jet occurs near the surface and it kicks medium partons , loses energy along its way , and fragments into the trigger particle and other fragmentation products in the `` jet '' component . </S>",
    "<S> the kicked medium partons , each of which acquires a momentum kick @xmath9 from the near - side jet , materialize by parton - hadron duality as ridge particles . </S>",
    "<S> the ridge particle momentum distribution is related to the initial momentum distribution by a momentum shift . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore extract the initial parton momentum distribution from the ridge data for central auau collisions at @xmath0 gev obtained by the star collaboration @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize the normalized initial parton momentum distribution as @xmath10 where @xmath11=@xmath12 , @xmath13 is a normalization constant defined by @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the rapidity fall - off parameter , @xmath16 is beam parton rapidity , @xmath17 is the beam parton mass , @xmath18 = @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a mass parameter introduced to give a better description of low-@xmath4 ridge data . for lack of a definitive determination , </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath16 equal to the nucleon rapidity @xmath21 and @xmath17 equal to @xmath18 , pending future definitive measurements of the ridge boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the observed ridge distribution is the final parton momentum distribution after jet - parton collisions , scaled by the average number of charged kicked partons per trigger , @xmath22 , that may be modified by a ridge attenuation factor @xmath23 .    </S>",

    "<S> the scaling relation between the fragments in the jet component and the trigger particle @xcite allows us to treat the auau jet component per trigger as a @xmath24 near - side jet distribution , attenuated by a semi - empirical attenuation factor @xmath25 @xcite . the experimental @xmath24 near - side jet data , shown as open circles in figs .  1 and 2 , can be described by the dash - dot curves in these figures obtained from @xmath26}/{2\\sigma_\\phi^2 } } \\ } }        { 2\\pi\\sigma_\\phi^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27=@xmath28 , @xmath29=0.5 , @xmath30=1.1 gev , @xmath31=0.75 , and @xmath32=0.55 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical evaluation of both the jet component and the ridge component for central auau collisions leads to the total yield of associated particles . a self - consistent comparison of the momentum kick model results with experimental data in figs .  1 , 2 , and 3 then allows us to search for the initial parton momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the totality of the star associated particle data @xcite from @xmath33 gev to 4 gev and @xmath34 from 0 up to 3.9 in central auau collisions at @xmath0 gev , can be described by the average momentum kick per jet - parton collision @xmath35 gev , the average effective numbers of kicked partons per jet @xmath36 , and the normalized initial parton momentum distribution eq .  </S>",

    "<S> 5(a ) , the momentum distribution for @xmath50 and high @xmath4 has a slope parameter @xmath51 that is intermediate between that of the jet and the inclusive particles . </S>",

    "<S> the distribution decreases rapidly as it approaches the kinematic limit and covers a smaller allowed region of @xmath49 as @xmath4 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the flat rapidity distribution at mid - rapidity for a fixed @xmath4 gives rise to the ridge structure that is observed experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> = -2 = 3.2 in in conclusion , the application of the momentum kick model for ridge particles associated with a near - side jet in central auau collisions at @xmath0 gev allows us to extract unique and valuable information on the medium parton momentum distribution at the moment of jet - parton collision . in the process </S>",
