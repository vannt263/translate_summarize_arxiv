    "financial markets in general and the drivers for market crashes in particular have been intensively investigated by the physics community in recent years .",
    "the interest in markets behavior stems from a number of different reasons relating both to the narrow financial interests of shareholders and investors and , arguably more importantly , to the devastating impact financial turmoil may have on national economies , leading to harsh social consequences and societal unrest .",
    "moreover , the observation of a sudden and dramatic collapse in complex systems intrigues the scientific community due to its resemblance to collective rearrangement in physical systems at critical points .",
    "this problem is at the core of the emerging field of econophysics  @xcite , which borrows mathematical and physical tools such as random matrix theory  @xcite , clustering analysis  @xcite , extreme and rare events  @xcite , agent based models  @xcite and network theory  @xcite , to name a few , to tackle the complexity of economical and financial systems .",
    "network theory provided a framework for analyzing economic structures  @xcite from the perspective of complex systems  @xcite , and is rooted in a much earlier search for structures in financial markets  @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach is partly due to shortcomings of existing economics - based theories in addressing the complexity of financial systems , and partly because many phenomena such as financial bubbles , herding , contagion and crashes found a natural interpretation in physical models that involve multi agents , collective behavior , influence spreading and phase transitions .",
    "phase transitions are sudden reorganizations of the system occurring when an external parameter , such as the temperature , is tuned to a critical value .",
    "moreover , at this critical point , the system is scale - invariant , leading to a power law behavior of the observables whose critical exponents may be studied using renormalization group and scaling theory  @xcite .",
    "a similar symmetry , discrete scale invariance  @xcite , has been shown to give rise to log - periodicity of prices in the proximity of financial collapses  @xcite .",
    "important contributions to the analogy between financial crashes and phase transition came also from the study of ecological and climate systems .",
    "in particular , a large effort has been devoted to studying the precursors of collapses  @xcite , showing that crashes are usually anticipated by a loss of resilience in the system ; in other word , when approaching a critical point , perturbations take more time to be reabsorbed and are more likely to propagate .",
    "this picture is consistent with that of physical systems near the critical point of a phase transition , where the cross correlation between the fundamental degrees of freedom of the systems is very large and the system exhibits high susceptibility .    the study of correlations in financial networks has started a couple of decades ago and led to the development of several effective algorithms for extracting the underlying network topology  @xcite . their hierarchical structure",
    "could then be used to identify groups of stocks in terms of the corresponding economical sectors .",
    "these works originally focused on same - time correlations and only recently have been generalized to deal with the concept of causality  @xcite in financial data  @xcite .",
    "the study of directed influences , aiming at predicting future prices , is interesting for investors for maximizing their returns ; however , it also has the potential to forecast the macroscopic behavior of markets .",
    "this objective is highly ambitious , but predicting the behavior of macroscopic properties from observation and modeling is at the heart of statistical physics and is of theoretical interest on its own right .",
    "attempts in this direction has been made using granger causality  @xcite and information theoretical methods such as mutual information and transfer entropy ( te )  @xcite , which outperform simple retarded correlations in capturing non - linear influences  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we generalize existing information theoretic approaches to study temporal interdependencies between financial indices in a time period of several years .",
    "more precisely , we analyze interdependencies between stocks of the ftse 100 companies , which includes the 100 largest companies ( in terms of market capitalization ) listed on the london stock exchange , from 2000 to 2015 . exploiting the physical intuition that financial crashes may be anticipated by periods of large susceptibility ,",
    "we use our method to investigate directed influences among the corresponding index constituents looking for a similar behavior , with the limited resolution of daily stock values .",
    "most of the literature in this area relies on intra - days influences since it is commonly believed that traders are well informed when making their decision , so that directed correlations and influences can be detected only at short time scales .",
    "this belief is an interpretation of the  efficient market hypothesis \"  @xcite , according to which prices reflect all the available information and thus there is no hope to predict and outperform the market .",
    "while this is true to some extent , other studies showed that this hypothesis is too simplistic and that daily stock prices do not behave as trivial random walks  @xcite . by analyzing moving periods of roughly two years each ,",
    "our findings support the common view that little information can be extracted from the past to predict future values at daily time scales .",
    "however , we notice that crisis periods make an exception to this rule . in fact , measuring the overall information flow between index components we detect strong interdependencies for periods corresponding to the crash of 2008 and the eurozone debt crisis of 2010 - 2012 .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the second section focuses on the materials and methods used , and is divided to three subsections .",
    "the first introduces the information theoretical methods which are commonly used for extracting direct influences , the second provides details on the dataset and the third explains the null model used to validate our analysis .",
    "the third section contains the results and the following ones provide a discussion and conclusion .",
    "further details on the methods are provided in the supporting information .",
    "in order to measure the influences among stocks we used an information theoretical tool which follows from a generalization of the symbolic transfer entropy ( ste )  @xcite . te and ste are",
    "powerful methods able to measure the amount of information flow between time series and thus can be used to reconstruct the network of influences between components of a complex systems .",
    "some of the most interesting cases where they have been successfully employed include network reconstruction of functional areas of the brain  @xcite , the study of social phenomena  @xcite and the influence of social networks on financial markets  @xcite .",
    "they have also been used in finance to analyze the relations between indices  @xcite and components of indices  @xcite .",
    "transfer entropy evaluates the information gained on future values of a time series @xmath0 by observing past values of another time series @xmath1 in addition to the past values of @xmath0 , relying on estimating the probabilities of occurrences of time series values . for real valued time series",
    "this is more difficult but ste , making use of symbolization , provides an effective solution to this problem .",
    "a symbol of @xmath2literals of the time series @xmath0 at time @xmath3 is obtained by reordering the last @xmath4 values of the time series at time @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath5 ) in an ascending order . by generalizing the time step from @xmath6 to an integer @xmath7",
    "we transform the data to a set of @xmath2dimensional symbols at times @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the role of the time scale @xmath7 , which reflects the inherent effective delayed interaction between components will be investigated later .",
    "a more formal definition as well as further details on the corresponding information theoretical measures are provided in the supporting information .    in this work ,",
    "we evaluate the influence of time series @xmath1 on @xmath0 by computing the following quantity @xmath10 this is the kullback - leibler divergence between the probabilities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , averaged over past symbols .",
    "alternatively it can be viewed as the difference between the conditional entropies of the two probabilities .",
    "if @xmath1 contains no information about @xmath0 this measure is zero . practically , due to the noisy nature of the data this never happens and one finds non zero values even when the two systems do not interact .",
    "this calls for the introduction of a null model to extract the genuine underlying behavior from the dataset ; this will be discussed in detail later on .",

    "we observe a peak around the two major financial crises of the last decades , this effect fades away as @xmath7 increases .",

    "long periods , studying shorter time windows would help in getting more reliable estimates .",

    "this may be done in several ways  @xcite , ranging from a random reshuffle of the original time series to more refined methods  @xcite .",
    "a simple reshuffling of data , while clearly destroying the interdependence among different time series , also destroys the single time series structure .",
    "the null model we use , based on the theory of surrogate data  @xcite , does allow one to preserve the spectral properties of the original spectrum in spite of the randomization . under the assumption that the single time series structure can be effectively represented by the power spectrum of the signal , a general time series @xmath0",

    "the series @xmath41 is thus a randomized version of @xmath0 but having the same power spectrum .",
    "we construct the null model by randomizing the original time series of the closing prices .",
    "then , for a given @xmath7 , we process these time series to obtain random returns using eq .",
    "( [ eq : return ] ) and compute the influences between the surrogate time series using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tildet ] ) .",
    "we compared the information flow in our original dataset and the null model to identify true information from noise since the latter does not contain genuine information flow between series .",
    "we analyzed the evolution of the network of influences between stocks in each of the ( about ) @xmath22 time windows indexed by @xmath14 .",
    "we associate a value @xmath42 $ ] to each directed link @xmath43 in order to measure the amount of genuine information flow from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "this is done by comparing the measure @xmath44 with the corresponding quantities computed for the surrogate dataset ; this is used to estimate the probability that information flow values obtained in the real dataset have been obtained at random .",
    "further details are provided in the supporting information .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 are supposed to vary slowly from one time window to the next , say @xmath14 to @xmath46 ; conversely , the parameter @xmath27 that controls the shift between consecutive time - windows , may be too large or our results may not be sufficiently stable with respect to small changes . to address this issue we introduced the quantity @xmath47 where , the expression within the absolute value sign is the change in the genuine information flow originating from stock @xmath48 in two consecutive time windows .    to estimate the _ total _ information flow ,",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath49 and study its behavior as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "while the results for large @xmath7 confirm our expectations that no information flow can be detected , the results obtained at small @xmath7 as a function of @xmath14 are much more interesting .",
    "in particular , analyzing geometric return time series by setting @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tildet ] ) , we obtain the results shown in fig .  1 .",
    "at small values of @xmath7 this quantity sharply peaks around the financial crisis of 2008 , while this effect fades away as @xmath7 increases .",
    "we also notice that a similar behavior is observed during the period of the eurozone debt crisis between 2010 and early 2013 , and then again fades away as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the robustness of our results can be checked analyzing the behavior of @xmath51 . as can be seen in fig .  2 , this quantity , representing the information flow in two consecutive time windows , is close to zero most of the time and peaks at a value smaller than 1 .",
    "this confirms our assumption that the structure of influences is evolving smoothly .",
    "moreover , it drops to zero when @xmath7 increases , since there is no information flow in any windows .    finally , by manipulating the matrix @xmath45 , it is possible to probe a more detailed structure of the influences , introducing the information directionality flow @xmath52 the first term is a summation across columns , measuring the total information flow originating from the stock @xmath53 , while the second is a summation across rows , measuring the total information flow directed toward @xmath53 , originated from other stocks .",
    "the difference between these two terms provides a measure of whether the stock @xmath53 is influencing the market ( @xmath54 ) or is being influenced by the market ( @xmath55 ) , and by how much .",
    "a plot of the stock s directionality measures with time provides knowledge about how the stock s role in the market has been evolving , as shown in figs .  3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "this picture also provides another check on the slow evolution of the matrices @xmath56 during several time windows .",
    "to validate the results obtained using a different approach we employed another method to investigate the data .",
    "this method is based on extracting all the pairs @xmath57 for which @xmath58 is larger than a given threshold and then , using the same threshold , extracting all pairs of a _ surrogate dataset _ of time series for which the same condition is satisfied .",
    "finally , we compare the number of links extracted in the two cases .",
    "the surrogate dataset , obtained following the protocol outlined above , does not include genuine interactions between its degrees of freedom at any of the time windows considered and we do not expect it to reproduce the patterns found in fig .  1 .",
    "more specifically , we do not expect to observe an abrupt increase in the number of links around crises .",
    "we compute the ratio of the number of directed links detectable in the real and surrogate datasets and we denote this quantity by @xmath59 , in order to be consistent with the notation used in the supporting information , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sidefrx ] ) . figure  6 shows that such significant increases are not observed for the surrogate data and therefore these are genuine phenomena of the real dataset .",
    "we would like to point out that while we mainly discuss results obtained for @xmath50 , we also carried out the analysis for larger @xmath4 values .",
    "computing the matrices @xmath60 for larger @xmath4 values requires much more time ; additionally we were unsuccessful in extracting meaningful information @xmath45 even for @xmath61 .",
    "this is disappointing but is confirmed by other works  @xcite studying the te measure ( [ eq : tildetyx ] ) by varying the parameter @xmath4 , where it has been shown that large values of @xmath4 provide uninformative results .",
    "a possible reason is the signal - to - noise ratio , which is very small already for @xmath50 and is presumably lost in more complicated models of influences .",
    "moreover , when increasing @xmath4 at a fixed @xmath35 , we notice that the quality of the probability estimation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tildetyx ] ) decreases .",
    "finally we repeated the analysis presented in the previous section by using the row prices rather than the returns , even if they are usually not studied in this context .",
    "as explained in the supporting information , there are more or less conservative link extraction protocols , where , roughly speaking , the first ones lead to extract ( maybe too ) few trustworthy links and the last ones lead to extract ( maybe too ) many links at the price of considering many spurious links . employing a less conservative protocol when considering time series of prices we obtained results which resemble those presented above while the exact same protocol used before leads to uninteresting results where no information can be extracted in any window , as shown in fig .  7 .",
    "this is consistent with the common belief that returns , in general , carry more useful information than prices .",
    "the ratio of the number of directed links detectable in the real and surrogate datasets .",
    "this is made in order to be consistent with the notation used in the the threshold used is @xmath62 but similar qualitative results are obtained for other values .",
    "we see that as @xmath7 increases this ratio approaches @xmath6 , while at short time scales it resembles the results of fig .",
    "1.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] [ fig6 ]    , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : totaliw ] ) , at different time differences @xmath7 , when computed for daily prices rather than returns .",
    "each time window @xmath14 is @xmath15 days long .",
    "the date associated with each @xmath14 is the middle of the time window considered .",
    "the @xmath16-axis tick marks correspond to the dates of the first of march each year .",
    "no meaningful information can be obtained from this analysis in contrast to the results presented in fig .",
    "1.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] [ fig7 ]",
    "in this work we develop an information theoretical measure to compute the information flow among time series .",
    "the new method improves on the standard linear methods such as retarded correlations or the granger causality measure  @xcite , allowing one to extract influences that would be otherwise hardly detectable .",
    "our analysis describes the structure of the market in a long time period spanning from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , exposing a critical behavior at times of financial crises .",
    "the analysis supports the dominant viewpoint according to which no information can be extracted at long time scales ( of days ) at normal day - to - day operations , but sheds light on the emergence of interlinked information flow at times that are close critical events .",
    "near such events the corresponding financial time series , may be very different from random walks and exhibit information flows at the time scales of days , as observed in  @xcite .",
    "we clearly observe that information flow between stocks during non - crises periods have short - lived effects on the market , whereas during crises they exert their influence over a larger range of time scales , having longer - lasting effects .",
    "interestingly , we notice that early signals of crashes could already be detected in the markets months before the full manifestation of the crises . the lehman brothers bankruptcy , that arguably marks the onset of the 2008 financial crisis , is dated to september 15 , 2008 , and while this event is clearly recognizable in fig .  1",
    ", we also notice that the cross - stock information flow started to grow months in advance , when the american subprime mortgage market started to unfold .",
    "whether or not this method can predict catastrophic events is unclear , but it can definitely measure the susceptibility of financial markets and their robustness to volatility as it exposes the strengthening of long - range correlations , in analogy to complex systems close to a phase transition .",
    "future work will apply this method to probe information flows at shorter time scales , which represent every - day operation .",
    "looking at finer time scale would provide useful insights in order to characterize the state of markets even far from global crises .",
    "in this section we present the information theoretical tools at the heart of the transfer entropy measure defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tildet ] ) .",
    "let us consider two time series , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and denote by @xmath65 the @xmath4 past time steps of the time series @xmath66 at time @xmath31 : @xmath67 .",

    "the transfer entropy from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath60 , is the average over the past observations of  ( [ eq : kl_x_y ] ) : @xmath71\\:~. \\label{eq : teytox}\\ ] ] it accounts for the information gained about the present value of the time series @xmath0 by also considering the @xmath72 past values of the time series @xmath1 , in addition to the @xmath4 past values of @xmath0 .",
    "the time steps scale can be generalized from @xmath6 to a general value @xmath7 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath73 .",
    "usually , the computation of te is done by setting @xmath74 for computational reasons ; moreover , increasing @xmath4 may destroy meaningful information flow , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "the computation of te from the observed time series requires estimation of the various probability distributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : teytox ] ) . among the proposed estimation methods is ste  @xcite , which employs the technique of symbolization .",

    "is denoted by @xmath76 .",

    "the symbolic transfer entropy is then defined by @xmath77 which directly follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : teytox ] ) once that explicit values are replaced by symbols .",
    "assuming stationarity , the required probability distributions can be estimated by computing the occurrences of symbols in the time series , suppressing the effect of noise and bypassing the fine - tuning of parameters in probability distribution estimation protocols .",
    "notice that each symbol is drawn from the values of the time series at @xmath4 time steps into the past and so that a single symbol contains information from @xmath4 historic time steps .",
    "the measure we introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tildet ] ) is very similar to ste but rather than dealing with @xmath4-dimensional symbols , it aims to predict @xmath78-dimensional symbols from @xmath4-dimensional ones , but with a modest computational cost .",
    "the main reason to introduce this measure has been to gain computational power in predicting symbols of @xmath78 literals ; this was particularly important due to the long preprocessing time required for the type of datasets analyzed .",
    "the reason is that for each pair of stocks there must be a one - to - one correspondence between the respective trading days .",
    "days when one of the two is not traded are potentially problematic since they may shift the time index in one of the two and interfere with the causality relations . to deal with this issue we adopted a practical approach by removing all the non - common days in each pair of the time series considered .",
    "since the number of disregarded days in each pair of stocks does not exceed 10 days this may seems a minor difficulty . by the way it requires a larger pre - processing effort , since we can not symbolize the time series once and for all before computing the matrix @xmath79 .",
    "instead , we have to pre - process the time series of the stocks on a pair - by - pair basis before symbolizing it for each pair in a dedicated manner , which slows down the process considerably .      here",

    "this can be done computing , for each @xmath16 , the ratio @xmath111 the ratio @xmath112 decreases to @xmath113 as @xmath16 increases : small @xmath112 values are associated with @xmath16 values for which it is more likely to have a genuine information flow .",
    "thus , we associated a weigh to each pair @xmath43 given by @xmath114 where @xmath110 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these two histograms can be seen in fig .  8 for two particular time windows .",
    "one of the possible pitfalls of this method is that values in @xmath102 are correlated to values in @xmath99 .",
    "if this were to be the case , we would underestimate the number of detected influences ; however , as the scatterplot in fig .",
    "9 shows , this is not the case . using this value of @xmath117 can be seen as a soft thresholding method which roughly corresponds to considering a @xmath109-value smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "statistically validated networks are obtained by considering much smaller thresholds that take into account multiple comparison effects . by the way ,",
    "employing such a strict protocol would provide poor results in the present case because the possible retrievable information is very small and we are forced to adopt a less conservative protocol .",
    "nevertheless , our results have been cross - validated by using the method described in the discussion section , and the fact that the null model is unable to reproduce the total information flow patterns detected in the original dataset validates the results of the analysis .",

    "<S> to identify emerging interdependencies between traded stocks we investigate the behavior of the stocks of ftse 100 companies in the period 2000 - 2015 , by looking at daily stock values . exploiting the power of information theoretical measures to extract direct influences between multiple time series , we compute the information flow across stock values to identify several different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> while small information flows is detected in most of the period , a dramatically different situation occurs in the proximity of global financial crises , where stock values exhibit strong and substantial interdependence for a prolonged period . </S>",
