    "as is well known , interactions between quantum systems tend to increase their entanglement .",
    "quantum correlations between physical systems should then be omnipresent . a first obstacle to detecting them",
    "is that real systems are inevitably influenced by surrounding degrees of freedom .",
    "the importance of the role played by the environment is substantiated by the fact that two systems can not remain maximally entangled while they get entangled with a third system @xcite . and indeed , it has been shown , for both free particles @xcite and two - level systems @xcite , that two non - interacting open systems , initially prepared in an entangled state , evolve into a classically correlated state . however ,",
    "when interactions between the two systems are taken into account , the situation is not that clear .",
    "revivals of entanglement and even long - time entanglement have been obtained @xcite . moreover , even if there is no direct interaction , entanglement can be induced by environment - mediated interactions @xcite .",
    "the influence of the environment may thus not fully explain why quantum correlations are so imperceptible .    in the above - cited works ,",
    "the correlations between the two systems considered are studied using their full bipartite quantum state .",
    "such complete knowledge is unattainable when the systems of interest consist of a large number of degrees of freedom . in general",
    ", the accessible information on the state of the compound system under study consists of a finite set of expectation values .",
    "such limited data can be compatible with a classically correlated state whereas the actual bipartite state is entangled @xcite .",
    "interaction - induced quantum correlations may thus be practically undetectable , even in the case of negligible influence of the environment , if one or both of the two coupled systems is large enough .",
    "a prominent example of such a situation is provided by the dynamical approach to the measurement process .",
    "the reduced state of a system @xmath0 suitably coupled to a larger one @xmath1 , evolves into a statistical mixture of pure states determined by the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with weights given by born rule @xcite .",
    "this decoherence is directly related to the development of entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , as mentioned above , quantum correlations between these two systems may be essentially indiscernible .    in this paper",
    ", we address this issue by considering a measurement apparatus @xmath1 that consists of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the resulting model is simple enough to allow the derivation , without any approximation , not only of the reduced dynamics of @xmath0 , which is the usual focus of decoherence studies @xcite , but also of the temporal evolution of correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 induced by their mutual interaction .",
