    "a poincar - covariant faddeev equation for baryons was introduced in ref.@xcite . in principle , it sums all possible quantum field theoretical exchanges and interactions that can take place between the three dressed - quarks that characterise a baryon s valence - quark content ; and first , rudimentary computations were described in ref.@xcite .",
    "numerous analyses of baryon properties using this framework have subsequently appeared , with the level of sophistication and breadth of application increasing steadily , _",
    "e.g_.  refs.@xcite .",
    "the computational effort required to solve the faddeev equation has naturally increased as the kernels have become more complex , so that one can consume significant resources in formulating and tackling even straightforward problems @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "numerous practical and realistic simplifications present themselves .",
    "chief amongst these is suggested by the observation that bound - state studies which employ realistic quark - quark interactions @xcite predict the appearance of nonpointlike colour - antitriplet quark@xmath6quark ( diquark ) correlations within baryons @xcite .",
    "consequently , the baryon bound - state problem may be transformed into solving the linear , homogeneous matrix equation depicted in fig.[figfaddeev ] .",
    "the veracity of this approximation was established in ref.@xcite ; and it has yielded a wide variety of novel predictions for baryon structure and interactions @xcite .",
    "notably , empirical evidence supporting the presence of diquarks in the proton is accumulating @xcite .",
    "poincar covariant faddeev equation .",
    "@xmath7 is the faddeev amplitude for a baryon of total momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the shaded rectangle demarcates the kernel of the faddeev equation : _ single line _ , dressed - quark propagator ; @xmath9 , diquark correlation amplitude ; and _ double line _ , diquark propagator .",
    "( see sec.[secfaddeev ] for details.),scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the diquarks within baryons are correlated by dressed - gluon exchange @xcite and their structure is therefore described by a bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "these correlations are thus fundamentally different from the rudimentary , elementary diquarks introduced roughly fifty years ago in order to simplify treatment of the three - quark bound - state @xcite .",
    "as highlighted by the shaded region in fig.[figfaddeev ] , the two - body correlation predicted by modern faddeev equation studies is not frozen : all dressed - quarks participate in all diquark clusters @xcite .",
    "the baryon spectrum produced by this faddeev equation should therefore possess significant overlap with that of the three - quark constituent model and bear no simple relationship with that of the quark@xmath6elementary - diquark picture .    given that solving the faddeev equation can demand extensive numerical analysis ,",
    "many authors have sought simplifications .",
    "a drastic approach is to replace the bethe - salpeter kernel for the quark - quark system by a momentum - independent interaction , a motivation for which may be found in the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite . on the other hand , following a body of recent work @xcite it may also be viewed differently .",
    "namely , since gluon propagation is characterised by a mass - scale @xmath10gev , which screens infrared field modes @xcite , a vector@xmath0vector contact - interaction can be a realistic representation of the quark - quark scattering kernel in qcd so long as the momentum scales being resolved are smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , a symmetry - preserving dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) treatment of this interaction yields many results that are practically indistinguishable from those obtained with the most sophisticated kernels that have thus far been employed @xcite .",
    "recall now that quark exchange within the faddeev equation kernel , highlighted by the shading in fig.[figfaddeev ] , guarantees that no single dressed - quark is treated differently from the others .",
    "this exchange also provides additional binding within the baryon . here , in the context of a contact vector@xmath0vector quark - quark interaction , which produces diquark correlations amplitudes ( @xmath9 in fig.[figfaddeev ] ) that are momentum - independent",
    ", dynamical quark - exchange is the only feature of the faddeev kernel which can introduce momentum dependence into the baryon faddeev amplitude , @xmath7 .",
    "this complication , too , may be avoided if one employs a `` static approximation '' for the exchanged quark , _ viz_.  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13gev is the momentum - independent dressed - quark mass obtained in solving the gap equation using a contact interaction that provides an efficacious phenomenology . using eq . , or variants thereof , the faddeev equation collapses to a simple algebraic expression , whose solution provides both a baryon s mass and a momentum - independent faddeev amplitude , which expresses the relative strength of various possible diquark correlations in the bound - system @xcite .    today",
    ", eq . is often a convenience , not a necessity .",
    "it is employed by some authors because it can assist with the development of intuition about the bound three - valence - quark system and its properties . furthermore",
    ", where comparisons with more sophisticated studies can be made , such as for the nucleon , @xmath1-baryon , and the roper resonance @xcite , the static - approximation provides an equally good description of baryon masses . on the other hand , it provides a flawed description of hadron elastic and transition form factors because it leads to extreme hardening @xcite , and fails completely in describing the internal structure of the roper resonance @xcite .",
    "herein we therefore analyse the nucleon and , to a lesser extent , @xmath1-baryon faddeev equations using the contact - interaction but eschewing the static - approximation , with an aim of determining whether the increased complexity brings benefits which outweigh the loss of simplicity .",
    "we formulate the associated faddeev equations in sec.[secfaddeev ] and describe a procedure for their solution in sec.[definefe ] .",
    "the results for the masses and amplitudes are presented and discussed in sec.[secresults ] .    as noted at the outset ,",
    "the faddeev equation is important because its solutions enable computation of numerous observable properties of baryons .",
    "hence , in sec.[seccurrents ] we present results for the nucleon @xmath2-term , bjorken-@xmath14 values for the separate ratios of unpolarised and longitudinally polarised @xmath4- and @xmath5-quark parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , the proton s tensor charges , and derived results for the neutron and proton electric dipole moments ( edms ) .",
    "we conclude in sec.[secconclusion ] .",
    "the basic pieces of the faddeev equation in fig.[figfaddeev ] are the dressed - quark and -diquark propagators , and the diquark bethe - salpeter amplitudes .",
    "the dressed - quark propagator is obtained from a gap equation :    [ gendsen ] @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the gluon propagator ; @xmath17 , the quark - gluon vertex ; @xmath18 , a symbol representing a poincar invariant regularisation of the four - dimensional integral , with @xmath19 the regularisation mass - scale ; and @xmath20 is the current - quark bare mass .",
    "we employ a confining , symmetry - preserving dse treatment of a vector@xmath0vector contact - interaction , which is implemented by writing @xmath21 where @xmath22gev is a gluon mass - scale typical of qcd and the fitted parameter @xmath23 is commensurate with contemporary estimates of the zero - momentum value of a running - coupling in qcd @xcite .",
    "this interaction is embedded in a rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation of the dses @xcite , _",
    "viz_.  one writes @xmath24 in the gap equation and in the subsequent construction of the bethe - salpeter kernels .",
    "notably , with realistic interactions @xcite , the rl truncation is known to be reliable for properties of the following ground - states : isospin - nonzero - pseudoscalar- and vector - mesons , and octet and decuplet baryons @xcite .    using eqs .",
    ", , the gap equation becomes @xmath25 we have assumed isospin symmetry , so that @xmath26 and strong interactions do not distinguish between @xmath4 and @xmath5-quarks , and use a euclidean metric , which is detailed in appendixa of ref.@xcite .",
    "equation   possesses a quadratic divergence ; but if that is regularised in a poincar covariant manner , the solution is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is momentum - independent and determined by @xmath29    we implement a confining regularisation of the contact - interaction by following ref.@xcite and writing @xmath30 where @xmath31 are , respectively , infrared and ultraviolet regulators .",
    "this will be our definition of @xmath18 . evidently , a finite value of @xmath32 in eq.([explicitrs ] ) implements confinement by ensuring the absence of quark production thresholds in colour singlet amplitudes .",
    "it is worth adding to this remark .",
    "contemporary theory predicts that both quarks and gluons acquire mass distributions , which are large at infrared momenta @xcite .",
    "the generation of these mass distributions leads to the emergence of a length - scale @xmath33fm , whose existence is evident in all modern studies of dressed - gluon and -quark propagators and which signals a marked change in their analytic properties . in this realisation , which has been canvassed by numerous authors ( _ e.g_.  refs.@xcite and citations thereof ) , confinement is a dynamical process that may be realised via eq ..     c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@@xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + 0.36 & 0.007 & 0.37 & 0.78 & 1.06 & 2.74 & 0.31 & 1.30 +    the interaction in eq.([njlgluon ] ) does not define a renormalisable theory and hence @xmath42 can not be removed .",

    "solutions are listed in table  [ tab : dressedquarks ] .",

    "that in the chiral limit , @xmath46 , a nonzero solution for @xmath47 is obtained so long as @xmath48 exceeds a minimum value . with @xmath49 as specified in the table , that value is @xmath50 .",
    "this appearance of `` mass from nothing '' expresses the phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) , which is the source of more than 98% of the mass of visible material in the universe @xcite .",
    "it has long been known @xcite that scalar and axial - vector diquark correlations are overwhelmingly dominant in the nucleon because all are positive - parity states and the correlation masses satisfy @xmath37 , @xmath51 .",
    "notably , the @xmath1-baryon involves only axial - vector diquarks because it is impossible to build an isospin-@xmath52 state from a dressed - quark and an isospin - zero scalar diquark .",
    "a contact interaction treatment of diquark correlations is detailed in sec.2.2 of ref.@xcite . in this case , the scalar and axial - vector diquarks are described by the following amplitudes :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 .",
    "these amplitudes do not depend on the quark - quark relative momentum ; and in all applications they are canonically normalised ( @xmath55 ) :    @xmath56    the computed values of the correlation mass - scales and the constants which characterise the amplitudes are listed in table  [ tab : dressedquarks ] .",
    "numerous details relating to the faddeev equation treatment of the nucleon and @xmath1-baryon are provided elsewhere ( _ e.g_.  sec.3 and appendix  c in ref.@xcite ) .",

    "the impact on the faddeev amplitudes is dramatic . in stark contrast to static approximation results , contact - interaction dynamical quark exchange produces amplitudes that compare far more favourably with those obtained using kernels built from elements that possess momentum - dependence typical of qcd [ fig.[f3 ] ] .",

    "<S> a confining , symmetry - preserving , dyson - schwinger equation treatment of a vector@xmath0vector contact interaction is used to formulate faddeev equations for the nucleon and @xmath1-baryon in which the kernel involves dynamical dressed - quark exchange and whose solutions therefore provide momentum - dependent faddeev amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are compared with those obtained in the static approximation and with a qcd - kindred formulation of the faddeev kernel . </S>",
    "<S> they are also used to compute a range of nucleon properties , amongst them : the proton s @xmath2-term ; the large bjorken-@xmath3 values of separate ratios of unpolarised and longitudinally - polarised valence @xmath4- and @xmath5-quark parton distribution functions ; and the proton s tensor charges , which enable one to directly determine the effect of dressed - quark electric dipole moments ( edms ) on neutron and proton edms . </S>"
