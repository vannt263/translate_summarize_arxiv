    "post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) objects are rapidly evolving stars of low and intermediate initial mass ( 0.8 - 8 m@xmath1 ) in the transition phase between agb and planetary nebulae ( pn ) .",
    "this phase is very short ( of the order of 1000 yrs ) but yet very important and still poorly understood .",
    "the departure from spherical symmetry or changes in surface chemical composition during agb are still studied using post - agbs in order to understand the late stages of stellar evolution .    analyzed post - agbs",
    "were taken from the very likely part ( 346 objects ) of the toru catalogue of galactic post - agb and related objects ( @xcite - http://www.ncac.torun.pl/postagb2/ ) .",
    "sources were cross - correlated with the akari catalogue .",
    "we found matches for 144 objects within 30@xmath2 radius from the reference coordinates of post - agb objects ( usually 2mass coordinates ) , and all of them with good photometry at 90@xmath0 m .",
    "there are 256 sources with iras counterparts in toru catalogue . among 144 post - agb objects found in akari ,",
    "143 have iras counterparts .",
    "this implicates that  56% of post - agbs with iras counterparts have akari counterparts .",
    "there is a lack of akari sources with f65@xmath35jy when comparing to iras sources .",
    "the completeness of our sample as a function of fluxes is shown in figure  [ compsam ] .",
    "the positional accuracy is in most cases in agreement with 2mass coordinates . for 139 out of 144 objects",
    "the akari-2mass separation is below 15@xmath2 and for 127 of them below 10@xmath2 ( figure  [ sep ] ) .",
    "since the iras coordinates differ from 2mass ones , the akari - iras separation is slightly different and resulting in 126/143 objects with the separation below 15@xmath2 and 107/143 below 10@xmath2 .    the comparison of akari and iras fluxes f60 vs. f65 and f90 vs. f100 is shown in figure  [ akir ] .",
    "the correlations are roughly linear ( restriction to objects with cirrus emission less than 100 mjy / sr does not improve shown relation ) .",
    "in general , post - agb objects show maximum of their infrared emission between 25 and 60@xmath0 m and thus their flux is smaller toward longer wavelengths , e.g. sources show less flux at 65@xmath0 m than at 60@xmath0 m and , consequently , less flux at 100@xmath0 m than at 90@xmath0 m .    according to @xcite and",
    "@xcite we can divide post - agb sources into 3 groups depending on their morphology and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) : duplex with seds of class ii and iii ( classes by @xcite ) , sole with seds of class iv and stellar objects with seds of class i or 0 .",
    "figure  [ sole ] shows color - color diagram for post - agb objects with different sed classes .",
    "stellar objects ( crosses ) have small values of [ 12]-[25 ] characteristic for sources with no envelope .",
    "duplex objects ( circles ) have in general larger values of [ 65]-[90 ] than soles ( black dots ) as a consequence of more ( cold ) dust in their envelopes .",
    "at longer wavelengths there are 9 objects from our sample detected at both 140 and 160@xmath0 m and additionally 25 sources detected only at 140@xmath0 m .",
    "seds of 9 post - agbs are displayed in figure  [ seds ] . in general , objects detected at 140 and/or 160@xmath0 m are the brightest ones in our sample and very dusty at the same time ( e.g. red rectangle , afgl 618 , egg nebula ) .",
    "[ 65]-[90 ] and/or [ 140]-[160 ] akari colors in combination with other infrared measurements will be used to select new post - agb candidates .",
    "newly discovered sources will be included in the toru catalogue of post - agb objects , together with all the available astrometric , photometric and spectroscopic data .    having akari fluxes we will be able to ( better ) constrain the dust temperature of post - agb objects .",
    "we also hope to obtain akari images of analyzed sources and thus get closer to understanding the late stages of stellar evolution .    based on observations with akari , a jaxa project with the participation of esa . this work has been supported by grant n203 0661 33 of mnisw of poland .",

    "<S> obscured by their circumstellar dusty envelopes post - agb stars emit a large fraction of their energy in the infrared and thus , infrared sky surveys like iras were essential for discoveries of post - agbs in the past . </S>",

    "<S> we discuss positional accuracy by comparing ( mostly ) 2mass coordinates of post - agb objects with those given by akari ; flux reliability by comparing iras 60 and 100 @xmath0 m fluxes with those from akari - n65 and akari-90 bands , respectively ; as well as completeness of the sample as a function of the iras fluxes . </S>"
