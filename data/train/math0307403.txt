    "below we investigate the structure of simplicial complexes in order to show that villarreal s cohen - macaulay criterion for graph - trees extends to simplicial trees ( corollary  [ cm - criterion ] ) .",
    "this is of algebraic and computational significance , as it provides an effective criterion for cohen - macaulayness that works for a large class of square - free monomial ideals .",
    "we introduce a condition on a simplicial complex that ensures the cohen - macaulayness of its facet ideal , and a method to build a cohen - macaulay ideal from any given square - free monomial ideal . along the road to the algebraic goal",

    "the paper is organized as follows : sections  [ basic - setup ] to  [ basic - trees - section ] review the basic definitions and cover the elementary properties of trees . in section  [ n - partite - section ] we draw comparisons between graph theory and simplicial complex theory , and prove a generalized version of knig s theorem in graph theory for simplicial complexes .",
    "we then go on to prove a structure theorem for unmixed trees in section  [ structure - theorem - section ] .",
    "we introduce the notion of a _ grafted _ simplicial complex in section  [ grafting - section ] , and show that for simplicial trees , being grafted and being unmixed are equivalent conditions .",
    "the notion of grafting brings us to section  [ cm - section ] , where we prove that grafted simplicial complexes are cohen - macaulay , from which it follows that a simplicial tree is unmixed if and only if it is cohen - macaulay .",

    "there are two cases to consider :    1 .",
    "@xmath446 for some @xmath4 such that @xmath447 .",
    "+ since @xmath161 is connected , it has some facets that intersect @xmath428 ; suppose that @xmath448 are all the facets of @xmath449 such that @xmath450 for @xmath451 .",
    "+ for each @xmath451 suppose that @xmath452 + the above paragraph translates into @xmath453 and hence @xmath454 for @xmath451 .",
    "+ from remark  [ embedded - intersections ] it follows that there is some total order of inclusion on the nonempty sets @xmath455 ; we assume that @xmath456 which after intersecting each set with @xmath457 turns into @xmath458 which is equivalent to @xmath459 + it follows that @xmath445 is a leaf of @xmath161 , and in addition , condition  ( v ) of definition  [ grafting ] is satisfied .",
    "2 .   @xmath460 for some @xmath418 such that @xmath461 .",
    "+ in this case for some @xmath4 , @xmath462 , @xmath463 + exactly as above , let @xmath464 be all the facets of @xmath449 such that @xmath465 , and let @xmath466 for @xmath451 . + as",
    "all the sets @xmath455 are nonempty , we follow the exact argument as above to obtain the chain @xmath467 + as @xmath468 , we can intersect all these sets with @xmath424 to obtain @xmath469 which is equivalent to @xmath470 + it follows that @xmath445 is a leaf of @xmath161 , and also condition  ( v ) of definition  [ grafting ] is satisfied .",
    "we are now ready to show that the facet ideal of a grafted simplicial complex has a cohen - macaulay quotient .",
    "besides revealing a wealth of square - free monomial ideals with cohen - macaulay quotients , this result implies that all unmixed trees are cohen - macaulay .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the previous sentence follows also from proposition  [ grafted - localization ] : if @xmath477 is any other maximal ideal of @xmath474 , from the proof of lemma  [ localization ] and proposition  [ grafted - localization ] we see that if @xmath478 is the ideal generated by all of @xmath479 that belong to @xmath477 , then @xmath480 is the facet ideal of a grafted simplicial complex over the vertex set @xmath481 .",
    "so one can write @xmath482 where @xmath83 is a prime ideal of @xmath483 $ ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath484_p / i_p \\otimes_k k[x_{e+1},\\ldots , x_n]_q.\\ ] ]    as @xmath483_q$ ] is clearly cohen - macaulay , by theorem  5.5.5 of  @xcite , it is enough to show that @xmath485_p / i_p$ ] is cohen - macaulay in order to conclude that @xmath486 is cohen - macaulay .",
    "but this is again the case of localizing at the irrelevant ideal .",
    "now suppose that for each @xmath487 , @xmath488 where @xmath489 is a free vertex of the leaf @xmath53 , and @xmath490 .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath491 is a regular sequence in @xmath474 .",
    "this follows from the process of `` polarization '' that we describe below",
    ".    [ polarization ] let @xmath30 be the ring @xmath31/({m_1,\\ldots , m_q})$ ] , where @xmath38 are monomials in the variables @xmath29 , and @xmath28 is a field .",
    "then there is an @xmath492 , and a set of square - free monomials @xmath493 in the polynomial ring @xmath494 $ ] , such that @xmath495 where @xmath496/(n_1 , \\ldots , n_q)$ ] and @xmath497 is a regular sequence of forms of degree one in @xmath498 .",
    "it is then shown that @xmath509 is a non - zerodivisor in @xmath510 .",
    "if @xmath511 is square - free , we are done .",
    "otherwise one applies the same procedure to @xmath511 continually until the ideal becomes square - free .",
    "what we would like to show is that sequence  ( [ the - sequence ] ) polarizes the ring @xmath512/(y_1^{u_1 + 1 } , \\ldots , y_r^{u_r+1},e_1 , \\ldots , e_s)\\ ] ] into the ring @xmath474 , where @xmath513 are monomials corresponding to the facets @xmath514 , where each vertex belonging to @xmath53 has been replaced by the free vertex @xmath489 . in other words if @xmath515 we wish to show that @xmath516 it will then follow from the proof of proposition  [ polarization ] ( as detailed in  @xcite as well as in  @xcite ) that sequence  ( [ the - sequence ] ) is a regular sequence in @xmath474 .",
    "intuitively our claim is straightforward to see .",
    "the only problem that may arise is if after applying sequence  ( [ the - sequence ] ) to @xmath517 , we end up with a permutation of the vertices of @xmath18 . to prevent this from happening",
    ", we use the subtle structure of a grafted simplicial complex ( remark  [ embedded - intersections ] ) that the facets intersecting a leaf do so in an embedded ( and therefore ordered ) manner . in other words , suppose for the leaf @xmath53 , the facets @xmath518 are all the facets of @xmath519 that intersect @xmath53 , with the ordering @xmath520 so in sequence  ( [ the - sequence ] ) , we order @xmath521 such that if for any @xmath294 and @xmath522 , @xmath523 then @xmath524 .    we now use induction on the number of facets of @xmath18 .",
    "if we remove a joint , say @xmath525 , we obtain a grafted simplicial complex @xmath526 over the same set of vertices @xmath29 , with @xmath527 ( lemma  [ unmixed - induction ] ) . therefore if @xmath528/{{\\mathcal{f}}}({\\delta}')\\ ] ] then @xmath529    moreover , @xmath161 has @xmath280 as leaves . so by the induction hypothesis , sequence  ( [ the - sequence ] ) polarizes the ring @xmath530/(y_1^{u_1 + 1 } , \\ldots , y_r^{u_r+1},e_2 , \\ldots , e_s)\\ ] ] into @xmath531 , or in other words , @xmath532    the induction hypothesis has ensured that after applying sequence  ( [ the - sequence ] ) to @xmath533 , all facets of @xmath161 are restored to their original positions and labeling .",
    "now it all reduces to showing that during this polarization process , @xmath534 turns into @xmath92 .",
    "this is clear , as for every @xmath4 , @xmath535 has its place in the ordered sequence  ( [ ordered - sequence ] ) , and so if @xmath536 , then the first @xmath537 applications of sequence  ( [ sub - polar ] ) restore @xmath535 before moving on to facets that have larger intersections with @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath92 has disjoint intersections with @xmath280 , once sequence  ( [ sub - polar ] ) has been applied for all @xmath4 , @xmath92 is restored to its proper position .",
    "[ cm - criterion ] let @xmath18 be a tree over a set of vertices @xmath29 , and let @xmath28 be a field .",
    "then the quotient ring @xmath31/{{\\mathcal{f}}}({\\delta})$ ] is cohen - macaulay if and only if @xmath18 is unmixed ."
