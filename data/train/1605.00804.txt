    "the observations indicate that the relative proton - alpha particle collisional deceleration is more efficient than the proton isotropization ( and the alpha - particle isotropization ) but , on the other hand , proton - alpha particle collisions also tend to reduce both the proton and alpha particle temperature anisotropies ( in a relatively small number of cases the proton - alpha particle collisions enhance the ion temperature anisotropy ) . in some slow solar wind streams the coulomb collisions are sufficiently strong to reduce the differential velocity between proton and alpha particles at a pace that is comparable to that of the decrease rate of the alfvn velocity .",

    "similarly , @xcite show that coulomb collision with protons may be also important for other minor ions .",
    "it is possible that the ( summed effect of the ) interaction between protons and other minor ions may have a nonnegligible heating effect on protons ; the abundances of the other minor ions are much lower than the abundance of alpha particles but together they have about 1 % and they are about mass proportionally hotter than alpha particles .",
    "our results show that the different parallel and perpendicular temperatures and differential velocities between ion species need to be taken into account for the collisional transport coefficients especially in slow / collisional solar wind streams . for the given data",
    "set of the wind / swe observations at 1 au neglecting the ion temperature anisotropy and/or the differential streaming leads to relatively large errors .",
    "consequently , it is important to use the general , anisotropic and drifting approximation for the collisional transport coefficients , particularly for modeling of slow solar wind streams where the induced error cumulates .",
    "the present results have ( at best ) theoretical uncertainties of the order of @xmath98 . equation  ( [ lambdast ] ) gives the uncertainties 45 % for the ion - ion interaction .",

    "our model assumes bi - maxwellian particle velocity distribution functions drifting with respect each other along the ambient magnetic field .",
    "if the ion distribution functions in the solar wind strongly depart from this model , these collisional transport coefficients are likely not applicable and further work is needed . for instance , the solar wind protons often consist of two populations @xcite ; such a velocity distribution function can be to some extent modelled as a superposition of two drifting bi - maxwellian velocity distribution functions and the present model can be directly applied .",
