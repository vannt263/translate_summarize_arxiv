    "relations between equilibrium thermodynamic quantities and the work done in non - equilibrium processes are standard textbook material  @xcite .",
    "for example , in a non - equilibrium process the average work done @xmath0 on a thermal ensemble of systems with a fixed volume obeys ( @xcite ,   20 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the change in the helmholtz free energy of the system after the final state equilibrates at the same temperature as the initial state .",
    "this inequality follows from the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the process by which work is done on the system corresponds to a time variation of some of its state parameters and this variation must be identical for each ensemble element . because of the meaning of @xmath2 in ( [ wdf ] ) , one often envisages the experimental system re - equilibrating after the work is done , so that the final state , as well as the initial state , is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this assumption of a final equilibrium state is not necessary in order to use ( [ wdf ] ) , however : the work can be performed and measured without letting the system re - equilibrate and ( [ wdf ] ) still gives a prediction regarding the average measured work that can be verified if one can calculate the equilibrium free - energy difference .    in recent times fluctuation theorems",
    "have generalised this inequality to a set of non - equilibrium _ equalitites_.",
    "detailed fluctuation relations show that the probability distributions of stochastically fluctuating quantities for a non - equilibrium process , such as entropy , work and heat , are linked to equilibrium properties and corresponding quantities for the time - reversed process  @xcite .",
    "a well - known integral fluctuation relation is the jarzynski work relation where the exponentiated work is averaged over its distribution and related to an equilibrium free - energy difference  @xcite .",
    "jarzynski s relation strengthens ( [ wdf ] ) by including all moments of the non - equilibrium work resulting in an _ equality _ from which ( [ wdf ] ) follows for the first moment .",
    "experiments with bio - molecules have used fluctuation theorems to derive , from the measurable work in non - equilibrium pulling experiments , the desired equilibrium free - energy surface of the molecules  @xcite , the latter being impossible to measure directly . in physics , fluctuation theorems",
    "have been measured for example , for a defect center in diamond  @xcite , for a torsion pendulum  @xcite , and in an electronic system  @xcite .",

    "jarzynski s relation in its general form states @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature of the initial thermal ensemble and @xmath5 denotes the change in a free - energy measure @xmath6 that differs from the usual helmholtz free energy by the inclusion of a contribution from the coupling of the system to the thermal environment ( heat reservoir )  @xcite .",
    "the final value of @xmath6 used to calculate @xmath5 is that of the final state of the system after it equilibrates at the same temperature ( @xmath4 ) as the initial state .",
    "the usual assumption of quasi - closed systems  @xcite is based on a system - environment coupling that gives a very small contribution to the system hamiltonian leading to thermodynamic quantities that are extensive  @xcite .",
    "quantities such as the helmholtz free energy @xmath7 are then calculated using the free - system hamiltonian , without taking account of the coupling to the environment  @xcite .",
    "this is often an excellent approximation , but even then the jarzynski equality , as a strict equality , does not hold for the helmholtz free - energy difference @xmath2 , but rather for @xmath5 . for significant system - environment coupling there will in general be no close relation between @xmath5 and the free - energy difference @xmath2 calculated from the hamiltonian of the uncoupled system .",

    "if the coupled system and environment are in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 then it is easy to show that the system is distributed according to a phase space probability density @xmath14 that can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an effective hamiltonian for the system  @xcite known as the hamiltonian of mean force  @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath16 is @xmath17/(k_bt)\\right\\}}{\\int dx\\,\\exp\\left[-h_e(x)/(k_bt)\\right]}\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath18 is the partition function associated with the distribution ( [ rho ] ) : @xmath19 the distribution ( [ rho ] ) of the system is obtained by  tracing out \" the environment ; the coupling of the system to the environment means this distribution is not a boltzmann distribution based on the free - system hamiltonian @xmath9 .",
    "the choice of @xmath16 as the effective hamiltonian in the distribution ( [ rho ] ) is not unique : one could add any @xmath20-independent term to ( [ hmf ] ) ( for example one could cancel the denominator in the logarithm ) and re - define the partition function ( [ zstar ] ) accordingly .",
    "but @xmath16 reduces to the free - system hamiltonian @xmath9 when the coupling to the environment vanishes , which is a partial justification for its use as an effective hamiltonian of the system . as the effective hamiltonian of the system  @xcite",
    "a perhaps surprising validation of the hamiltonian of mean force occurs in the casimir effect , where it determines the zero - point and thermal energy density of electromagnetic fields inside materials  @xcite .",
    "casimir forces calculated from this energy density agree with those deduced from the electromagnetic stress tensor  @xcite . ]",
    "the free energy @xmath6 that appears in the jarzynski equality ( [ jar ] ) is the free energy associated with the partition function ( [ zstar ] ) : @xmath21    the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the jarzynski equality in a model system , an exercise that is nontrivial except in the least interesting case of an isolated system . as jarzynski remarks in  @xcite ,",

    "our choice of model is the perfect gas , one of the classic thermodynamic systems .",
    "a single particle in the classical perfect gas is treated in the textbooks as a quasi - closed system , so that the thermodynamic quantities for the particle , and hence for the entire gas , are calculated using the free - particle hamiltonian  @xcite . in reality",
    "however , the single particle interacts with the other particles through collisions ; all the other particles act as a thermal environment to which the single particle is coupled .",
    "our interest in this model arises from the fact that the system we will consider ( a single particle ) is coupled to the environment ( the other particles ) whereas the helmholtz free energy of the system ignores this coupling .",
    "the question then arises of the difference between the helmholtz free energy @xmath7 and the free - energy @xmath6 that appears in jarzynski s equality ( [ jar ] ) for systems coupled to the environment . anticipating our results",
    ", we will find that although @xmath22 because of the system - environment coupling , @xmath5 will be equal to @xmath2 for the particular non - equilibrium process that we will analyse .",
    "the model reveals an interesting general implication from its structure : the jarzynski equality holds in the form @xmath23 where @xmath7 is the helmholtz free energy calculated from the free - system hamiltonian , in the general case of a system that is driven in one degree of freedom while interacting with the environment through other degrees of freedom .",
    "this is valid _ even when the coupling to the environment is arbitrarily large_.",
    "in the case of a perfect gas the total hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) of the system ( a single particle ) plus the environment ( all the other particles ) is given by @xmath24 the free - system and free - environment hamiltonians ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) depend on the canonical momenta of the particles while the interaction potential depends on the particle positions .",
    "we consider a gas of finite volume so the interaction potential @xmath27 describes not just the collisions between the particles but also the collisions with the bounding walls ( the walls are thus also part of the environment to which the system is coupled ) .",
    "collisions between the particles in our classical model will have to be calculated exactly so we take them to be impenetrable spheres of radius @xmath28 .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath27 thus consists of a set of potential barriers created by the particles and the walls ; the former barriers are functions of the distances between pairs of particles , while the latter barriers depend on the distances between the particles and the walls .",
    "the gas is initially in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 . in the usual approximation where each particle is considered as a quasi - closed system  @xcite",
    ", the coupling between the particles is ignored and the particle forming our system of interest occupies an infinitesimal volume of its phase space centred on @xmath29 with a probability @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the partition function and @xmath32 is the volume of the gas .",
    "the probability distribution ( [ bolzatom ] ) is the boltzmann - gibbs distribution resulting from the free - system hamiltonian @xmath33 in ( [ hgas ] ) .",
    "note that we do not use the semi - classical phase - space volume element @xmath34 , as our model is purely classical .",

    "the particle in this process would be trivial if the particle were a free system undergoing hamiltonian evolution determined by @xmath25in that case the work done would be just the change in energy of the particle .",
    "collisions with the other particles during the process described by ( [ mtau ] ) make the calculation of the work more interesting .",
    "if the particle of interest moves freely between collisions ( without its mass changing ) , its momentum @xmath40 is constant and its energy is given by @xmath41 .",
    "the momentum between collisions is constant even when the mass of the particle is changing continuously in time according to ( [ mtau ] ) because we have defined this process as a change of the mass in the system _ hamiltonian _ ( as opposed to , say , the lagrangian ) . with the changing mass parameter",
    "the system hamiltonian is @xmath42 , and so @xmath43 .",
    "the jarzynski equality only applies to parameter changes in the hamiltonian ; thus a process in which the particle lagrangian is @xmath44 , with @xmath45 given by ( [ mtau ] ) , would change the momentum of the driven particle and give a work relation that differs from the jarzynski equality .",
    "a collision changes the momentum of the driven particle discontinuously to a new value that is again conserved until the next collision . during the time interval @xmath46 in which the mass of the particle is given by ( [ mtau ] )",
    ", the maxwell distribution of velocities implies a non - zero probability of any number of collisions occurring .",
    "larger numbers of collisions are more unlikely than smaller numbers , however , and to make the problem tractable we will choose @xmath46 small enough so that it is highly probable there will be no collisions during this time interval , with a very small probability of one collision .",
    "the probabilities of two or more collisions during the time @xmath46 will be neglected as negligible .",
    "this approximation will not prevent us from checking the jarzynski relation ( [ jar ] ) as a strict equality because the inclusion of higher numbers of collisions leads to terms with higher powers of @xmath46 and the equality ( [ jar ] ) must separately hold for all orders of @xmath46 .",
    "we thus consider only two types of trajectories for the driven particle in the time interval @xmath46 : trajectories with no collisions and trajectories with one collision ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] ) .     with no collision ( left ) and with one collision at time @xmath47 ( right ) . as the momentum of the particle",

    "the momentum of the particle is conserved for @xmath52 as long as there is no collision , while its mass @xmath45 changes ; hence its velocity @xmath48 at time @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 if there is no collision .",
    "for the first type of trajectory , which has no collision for the entire interval @xmath46 , the work done on the particle throughout the change of its mass is the resulting change of energy ( with constant momentum @xmath54 ) : @xmath55 the second type of trajectory has a collision at time @xmath47 during the interval @xmath46 , in which the velocity of the particle is changed instantly from @xmath48 to a new value @xmath49 .",
    "the work done on the particle in this trajectory  @xcite is the sum of the change in its energy in the interval @xmath56 to @xmath47 before the collision ( with constant momentum @xmath54 ) and the change in its energy in the interval @xmath47 to @xmath46 after the collision ( with constant momentum @xmath57 ) : @xmath58    to calculate averages involving the work done on the driven particle , we compute separately the contributions of the two types of trajectories . for trajectories of the first type we must weight the average with the probability of no collision occurring during the interval @xmath46 , and also average over the initial velocity @xmath51 of the particle . for trajectories of the second type we must weight averages with the probability of a collision at time @xmath47 giving the particle a velocity @xmath49 , average over the possible post - collision velocities @xmath49 , sum ( integrate ) over all collision times @xmath47 in the interval @xmath37 , and average over the initial velocity @xmath51 .",
    "the statistics of a collision is the only challenging aspect of the model .",
    "while the collision _ rate _ in a perfect gas is not difficult to obtain  @xcite , we require something much more detailed for the calculation of the average work and average exponentiated work for the mass variation process .",
    "specifically , we need the statistics of the final velocity of a colliding particle that has been driven out of equilibrium with the rest of the gas ( the work ( [ w2 ] ) contains the post - collision speed @xmath59 of the driven particle ) .",
