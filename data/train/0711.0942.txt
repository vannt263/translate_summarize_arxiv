    "the presence of entanglement in phase transitions has attracted considerable interest over the past few years . understandably , quantum phase transitions were the natural place where one expected to find the non - local correlations of entanglement @xcite .",
    "a quantum phase transition is the qualitative change in the ground state of a many - body system brought on at zero temperature by the change of an external parameter or coupling constant . at the quantum critical point",
    "long - range correlations develop in the ground state and an extra quantity known as the quantum order parameter is required to fully describe the system .",
    "the motivation for investigating the entanglement in quantum phase transitions lies in the fact that the ground states of most condensed matter many - bodied systems occupy huge hilbert spaces and are difficult to construct . while one may not have full knowledge of such a ground state , one",
    "can still explore how the entanglement changes close to quantum critical points , thus accessing some aspects of the ground state s behaviour in critical regimes .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that entanglement can provide a physical picture and a deeper understanding of renormalisation methods @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite and their associated quantum order parameters @xcite .",
    "most research studying entanglement in phase transitions concerns discrete lattice type systems and to date hardly any research has focused on entanglement in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) phase transition .",
    "initially , simon @xcite demonstrated that any two regions of a uniform zero - temperature condensate of finite particle number are entangled .",
    "a recent paper @xcite demonstrated that entanglement exists only below the critical temperature for condensation , but a precise relationship between entanglement and the long - range order was not specified .",
    "the lack of research into entanglement in the bec phase transition stems from the fact that there is no entanglement between individual particles in a non - interacting bec .",
    "usually entanglement is thought to exist between individual particles or their internal degrees of freedom , but in this case one has to instead consider entanglement between regions of space occupied by particles .",
    "the ground state of a non - interacting bose gases is already well understood , which means that we do not need to use entanglement to characterise it s behaviour .",
    "so why , in this case , is it useful to study entanglement in the bec phase transition ?",
    "while the bec phase transition is classical , i.e. it occurs by varying the temperature , quantum effects develop on a macroscopic scale without the presence of interactions .",
    "this makes a non - interacting bec a remarkably simple platform for establishing concrete connections between entanglement and the long - range correlations that develop in phase transitions .",
    "if we can fully understand how entanglement emerges in the simple setting of the bec phase transition , we can use these results as a guide for understanding how entanglement and long - range correlations are related in more complicated systems . for instance , osborne and nielsen @xcite conjecture that entanglement is responsible for the long - range correlations that develop in the transverse ising and xy models at the quantum critical point and that at such critical points the system is maximally , or _",
    "critically _ , entangled .    in this paper",
    "we will develop a thorough understanding of entanglement in the bec phase transition and as a consequence we will be able to provide evidence for and against such statements .",
    "we will see that spatial coherence of a bose gas is necessary for entanglement between regions of space .",
    "the probabilities for the bosons to occupy the regions is the other crucial parameter affecting the entanglement .",
    "so while there may be spatial coherence between two points in space , these points will not be entangled because there is almost a zero probability of bosons populating the points . in this way",
    "we will be able to understand what portion of the long - range correlations are actually entanglement .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we will first discuss the concept of long - range order and spatial coherence of a bec in section [ becphasetrans ] , followed by brief discussions of spatial entanglement in section [ spatialent ] and an overview of an entanglement measure based on the purities of states in section [ purity ] . in section [ calculationsec ] we will calculate the entanglement between two regions of space around the critical temperature for condensation .",
    "an inequality relating the entanglement to spatial coherence will be derived in section [ entlrosec ] .",
    "we will compare our theoretical results for entanglement to recent experimental results measuring the spatial coherence of a bec in section [ expresultssec ] .",
    "to fully characterise entanglement in the bec phase transition we will consider multi - mode entanglement in section [ multientsec ] . finally in [ concludesec ] , we will conclude by discussing the results of this paper in the context of previous results concerning the role of entanglement in quantum phase transitions of discrete systems .",
    "a simple but important example of a phase transition is the formation of a bec . as a bose gas",
    "is cooled close to absolute zero , it passes a critical temperature where the chemical potential becomes comparable to the ground state energy causing a macroscopic number of bosons to collapse into the ground state of the confining potential . as a result ,",
    "all of the bosons behave as a single wave and the phase of the condensate becomes locked .",
    "the wavefunction of the condensate then plays the role of the order parameter .",
    "the appearance of an order parameter signifies that long - range correlations have developed between two distant points of a condensate .",
    "such long - range correlations were described mathematically by penrose and onsager @xcite in terms of the long - range order ( lro ) .",
    "lro is present in a condensate when the one - body reduced density matrix @xmath0,\\ ] ] is finite as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the creation and annihilation operators of particles at point @xmath4 .",
    "this definition holds for interacting and non - interacting gases , but because @xmath5 tends to the ground state density , @xmath6 , for @xmath1 , its value is diminished by particle interactions . the one - bodied reduced density matrix , @xmath7 , measures the presence of off - diagonal matrix elements in the state and determines the quantum coherences between two points .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the how the spatial coherence , described by @xmath7 , are related to entanglement .",
    "let us briefly consider whether the one - bodied reduced density matrix , @xmath8 , is a good measure of entanglement . if we imagine one particle distributed at two points , @xmath4 and @xmath9 , with equal probability , the state of the two points occupied by particles would be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "a two particle state is @xmath12 and a @xmath13 particle state would be @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath13 particle state , @xmath15 , clearly contains more entanglement than the one or two particle state , but the normalised one - bodied reduced density matrix is identical for all three cases .",
    "so while the one - body density matrix can detect entanglement , it can not differentiate between entanglement formed by one or n particles occupying the regions .",
    "what does it mean for two regions of space to be entangled ?",
    "we know from the simple form of hamiltonian of a non - interacting bec , @xmath16 , that individual particles are decoupled in momentum representation and are therefore not entangled to one another .",
    "however , one could also view this hamiltonian in position representation . here",
    "the operators , @xmath17 , that create and destroy particles in mode @xmath18 , transform as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the eigenvector for mode @xmath21 and @xmath22 creates a particle at position @xmath23 . in position representation , one can split the integral into multiple regions so that there are pairwise couplings between all regions of space , @xmath24 .",
    "this is in fact what leads to entanglement between regions of space",
    ".    spatial entanglement therefore takes the form of non - local particle number correlations between regions of space or _",
    "spatial modes_. the spatial modes are entangled and not the particles themselves . in order to ensure the correct hilbert space structure one must work with second quantised modes and not in the first quantised picture .",
    "in second quantisation the hilbert space of three spatial modes occupied by bosons have a tensor product structure .",
    "one is then able to trace out each mode to obtain a state of just two regions of the gas . for a more detailed discussion of this and other aspects of spatial entanglement see references @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we will use a measure of entanglement based upon the purities of the global and reduced states of the spatial modes .",
    "the purity , @xmath25 , measures the degree of information contained in a quantum state , @xmath26 , and is defined as @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the purity is related to the mixedness , @xmath28 , of the state by @xmath29(1-\\mu)$ ] , where @xmath13 is the number of modes .",
    "the purity ranges from one for pure states to @xmath30 for fully mixed states , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , is the dimension of the hilbert space . for a state ,",
    "@xmath33 , of two modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the global purity is defined as @xmath36 $ ] and the reduced purity of the @xmath37th mode is @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the reduced density operator of mode @xmath40 or @xmath35 .",
    "it is well known that the concepts of entanglement and the information encoded in a quantum states are closely entwined .",
    "for instance , in pure states , entanglement and the lack of information , or _",
    "mixedness _ , of the reduced state of a subsystem are equivalent .",
    "a maximally entangled pure state will have maximally mixed reduced states .",
    "thermal states on the other hand have a mixed global state .",
    "entanglement therefore exists in mixed states if the global mixedness of a quantum state is less than some function of the mixedness of the reduced states of the subsystems .",
    "an entanglement measure in terms of global and reduced purities for continuous variable gaussian states @xcite is @xmath41 when this inequality is satisfied , there is entanglement between modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the upper bound represents a physicality condition on the quantum state , @xmath33 . just below the lower bound there is a small region where entangled and separable states coexist .",
    "we shall see shortly that for systems with a large number of non - interacting particles , the region where separable and entangled states both exist goes to zero .    in what follows",
    "we shall choose the spatial modes so that the reduced purities of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are equal @xmath42 .",
    "the entanglement criterion then reduces to @xmath43 and will be used shortly to derive our entanglement witness .",
    "we will now calculate the entanglement between two spatial modes in a bec .",
    "let us consider a non - interacting bose gas of fixed particle number , @xmath13 , at temperature @xmath44 , placed in some confining volume @xmath45 , where the particles occupy energy levels determined by the eigenfunction @xmath46 .",
    "the results that we present here are for any confining potential ; we will present a specific example in section [ expresultssec ] .",
    "the purity measure , ( [ purityrelation ] ) , requires knowledge of the states of one and two spatial modes , @xmath47 and @xmath33 respectively , where regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 do not together occupy the entire volume @xmath45 .",
    "to arrive at , @xmath47 and @xmath33 , the state of the gas is mathematically divided into three regions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as this allows us to speak about spatial modes . in reality",
    "the gas remains unchanged as we are not considering physical partitions at all .",
    "region @xmath49 will then be traced out leaving the state , @xmath50 $ ] , of regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 that may be entangled .    to find the state , @xmath33 , of one particle ,",
    "we first create a particle in mode @xmath21 using the creation operator @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "but , as entanglement does not exist in momentum representation , we transform into position representation as @xmath53 , where the operator @xmath54 creates a particle at position @xmath4 . to form the three spatial modes @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the integral in @xmath55 is split into the three parts giving @xmath56 .",
    "the state of a single particle is @xmath57 , where each momentum mode is weighted by the probability of finding it in that mode , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the bose distribution @xcite .",
    "so far we have found the state of one particle expressed in terms of three spatial modes .",
    "to arrive at @xmath33 , region @xmath49 is traced over .",
    "we can perform the trace on each momentum mode separately , which results in the state @xmath61 $ ] for mode @xmath21 , where @xmath62 .",
    "explicitly @xmath63 is @xmath64 where the vector @xmath65 is the vacuum for regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the final state , @xmath33 , is therefore @xmath66 and likewise for @xmath67 .",
    "let us take a closer look at how one performs the trace in this situation .",
    "the operators @xmath68 act on point @xmath4 which is located within one of the three spatial modes .",
    "the trace of the @xmath37th spatial mode acts only on operators whose position vector @xmath4 is located in mode @xmath37 .",
    "one can write the trace of the @xmath37th mode as @xmath69 = \\sum_{n=0,1}\\int_i d\\vec{r}\\langle 0 |(\\hat{\\psi}(r))^n\\, ... \\,(\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(\\vec{r}))^n|0\\rangle$ ] .    as we are considering a gas of non - interacting bosons with hamiltonian @xmath70 , it is straightforward to generalise to the case of @xmath13 particles",
    ". we can write the @xmath13 particle state in terms of the single particle state as @xmath71 . to prove that this is equivalent to the state for becs found in text books consider one boson in first quantisation .",
    "one can place @xmath13 particles into this state , ensure it is correctly symmetrised and then move into second quantisation .",
    "equally one could place @xmath13 particles in the first quantised state and move directly into second quantisation , which results in the state above .",
    "for @xmath13 particles , the entanglement criterion ( [ purityrelation ] ) can be expressed differently in terms of the purities for the single particle density matrices , @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "the purity , @xmath74 of @xmath13 non - interacting particles is @xmath75=\\mu^n$ ] , where @xmath25 is the single particle purity . using this relationship",
    "the inequality for entanglement becomes @xmath76 for large @xmath13 . if the global purity is larger than the reduced purity , the two spatial modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 are entangled .",
    "indeed the upper bound , @xmath77 , is always satisfied if the state , @xmath26 , is physical to begin with and for large @xmath13 ( @xmath78 ) , separable and entangled states never coexist .    the global and reduced purities for a single particle can now be evaluated . the global purity , @xmath79 $ ] , is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the probability for occupying the @xmath37th spatial mode and @xmath82 .",
    "it is immediately clear that the state @xmath33 is not pure , as tracing out region @xmath49 destroys the coherences between it and regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "equally , the reduced purity for the state of one region contains no coherence terms and for region @xmath34 reads @xmath83=(p_b + p_c)^2 + p_a^2= p(p-1)+\\frac{1}{2 } = \\mu_r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for simplicity the reduced purities for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are chosen to be equal , @xmath42 .    using the entanglement criterion , @xmath76",
    ", we can write down a quantity , @xmath84 , that will be positive when there is entanglement between spatial modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 and is negative when the two modes are separable .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 can therefore be thought of as an entanglement witness and is given by @xmath85 when @xmath86 , the two regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are entangled .",
    "( [ entinequality ] ) is a general expression for non - interacting bose gases as one can consider a gas with any normalised momentum distribution @xmath87 , trapped in any geometry in any dimension .",
    "the second term , or _ coherence _ term , in @xmath84 measures the spatial coherence between regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the first term in @xmath84 is parameterised by the probability , @xmath88 , to occupy region @xmath34 or @xmath35 and takes into account the fact that while there may be coherences between two regions of any size , there is not necessarily entanglement .",
    "for entanglement to exist the purity of the global state has to be greater than the purity of the reduced state .    if the regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are half of the volume of the gas each , the probability to be in each region is @xmath89 and the second term in @xmath84 is zero . in this case entanglement",
    "is equivalent to spatial coherence between the two regions .",
    "this is particularly interesting as a small amount of coherence , and hence entanglement , will remain between two such regions above the condensation temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose two very small regions while there will be spatial coherence between them , there will be a relatively low probability for the bosons to occupy them and there will be no entanglement .",
    "we will plot @xmath84 for a specific system in section [ expresultssec ] .",
    "the normalised one - body reduced density matrix , @xmath90 is identical to @xmath82 used in the expression for entanglement @xmath84 , eq .",
    "( [ entinequality ] ) .",
    "the entanglement witness , @xmath84 , is already expressed in the language of lro and spatial coherence .",
    "it is evident that spatial coherence is necessary for entanglement between regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as the second term in @xmath84 is , of course , always positive .    rather than looking at the coherences between two points",
    ", it may be more appropriate to define a quantity , @xmath91 $ ] that measures the coherence between the regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the operators @xmath54 and @xmath92 are averaged over a detector profile @xmath93 in the regions , resulting in @xmath94 and @xmath95 that create and destroy particles in regions @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 = \\int_a d\\vec{r}\\,\\int_b d\\vec{r}\\ , ' g(\\vec{r})g^*(\\vec{r}\\,')\\rho(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}\\,').\\ ] ] from elementary statistics we know from the positivity of the variance , @xmath98 , that the expectation value of some quantity squared is greater than the square of the expectation value of the quantity , @xmath99 , namely @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath96 squared is always less than the first term in @xmath84- the expectation value of the one - body reduced density matrix squared , @xmath101 the left hand side of this inequality is the coherence term in the entanglement witness , @xmath84 , which is always greater than or equal to the newly defined coherence term @xmath96 . using this fact we can define a new quantity @xmath102 that also acts as an entanglement witness . @xmath103",
    "if the new quantity , @xmath102 , is greater than zero , @xmath104 , the previous entanglement inequality , @xmath86 , is automatically satisfied and there is entanglement between regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is worth expressing the entanglement witness in terms of @xmath96 as this quantity only depends upon the one - body density matrix , @xmath8 , rather than its square , and is straightforward to measure experimentally , see for instance @xcite .",
    "to bring clarity to the results presented in the previous sections we now present a specific example .",
    "we will consider a typical experimental set up , namely a bec confined in a harmonic cigar shaped trap .",
    "the exact trapping parameters that we use here have been taken from an experimental paper that measures the spatial coherence of a bec @xcite as this will allow us to make direct comparisons with experiment . in this case the transition temperature for condensation is @xmath105nk , the trapping frequencies are @xmath106 hz and @xmath107 and the number of bosons in the gas is @xmath108 . we take a one - dimensional slice through the trap , define regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 of size @xmath109 nm and trace out the rest of the gas .",
    "the amount of entanglement as determined by ( [ entinequality ] ) and quantified by the average logarithmic negativity @xcite can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "entanglement does not exist above the critical temperature for condensation and the amount of entanglement between the two regions increases as the temperature decreases .",
    "there is no entanglement between the regions when they are separated by more than @xmath110 nm .",
    "however the harmonic nature of the trap hides some of the interesting features of the entanglement .",
    "therefore let us review the results presented in simon @xcite .",
    "a bec was considered at zero temperature , where the bosons occupied all points with equal probability .",
    "the same amount of entanglement was found to exist between two regions of a given size at any separation , i.e. two regions that were touching or two regions that were very far apart have the same amount of entanglement between them .",
    "this is because in position representation there are pairwise couplings between all regions of space ( see section [ spatialent ] ) and in @xcite the probability to occupy any region of space was equal . here",
    "entanglement decreases with increasing region separation due to the gaussian ground state wavefunction . as the regions move further apart the probability for bosons to occupy the regions drops , and the state of regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 becomes increasingly mixed .",
    "we can compare our results for spatial coherence to the experimental results .",
    "let us start by describing in more detail the experiment by hnsch _",
    "_ @xcite that measures the spatial coherence , @xmath7 , of a weakly interacting bose gas . in this double slit type experiment",
    "two matter waves were extracted from two regions in the trap separated by @xmath111 .",
    "the matter waves were allowed to interfere and the degree of spatial cohrence was determined by the the visibility of the fringes .",
    "the position of each ` slit ' region was determined by the frequency of r.f .",
    "field that created transitions between magnetically trapped and untrapped states .",
    "the width of the slits were small , as the r.f .",
    "field only coupled weakly to the gas .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] where the spatial coherence is plotted for separations up to @xmath112 nm .",
    "we can make comparisons between the experimental results measuring spatial coherence between two regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] and our theoretical results for entanglement and spatial coherence in fig .",

    "let us first take a look at the spatial coherence in both cases .",
    "spatial coherence defined by @xmath96 eq .",
    "[ od ] , is denoted by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "there is greater spatial coherence between two regions that are closer together . in our theoretical results",
    "the spatial coherence for all three separations is very similar . if we compare this to the experimental results of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we see that the spatial coherence for separations @xmath110 nm and @xmath113 nm decreases much faster than our predictions . this is because bosons in a real gas interact with each other , which depletes ground state energy level and hence reduces the spatial coherence .",
    "we have not included interactions in our analysis as they only reduce the amount of spatial coherence by a small fraction , which would in turn only effect the amount of entanglement present by a small amount .",
    "the entanglement in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] is represented by dashed lines and exists only when spatial coherence exists .",
    "initially the amount of entanglement between the regions is governed by the behaviour of the one - bodied reduced density matrix , @xmath114 .",
    "when the spatial coherence , @xmath114 , between two regions falls below the probability for the bosons to not occupy the regions the entanglement falls sharply to zero .",
    "the global purity is larger than the reduced purity to begin with due to the presence of the coherence terms , but as the gas is heated the coherence terms reduce ( solid lines fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) until the global purity and reduced purity are equal .",
    "the entanglement then disappears .",
    "there is no entanglement between the regions when their separation is greater than @xmath112 nm , even when spatial coherence between the regions is maximum ( at @xmath115 ) .",
    "this is due to the bosons gathering around the centre of the trap so that the probability to occupy the regions is very low . here",
    "the state of two regions is very mixed , even at @xmath115 . on the other hand",
    "if the regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 occupy the entire trap , the amount of entanglement between them depends only on the spatial coherence between @xmath34 and @xmath35 and decreases steadily to zero as the spatial coherence goes to zero .",
    "one must carefully choose the set of spatial modes to ensure they detect the entanglement in the gas .",
    "we argue now why a bec at zero temperature is entangled , even though our choice of spatial modes may not detect the entanglement , such as two regions separated by @xmath116 nm .    at zero - temperature , @xmath115 , all of the bosons occupy the ground state and the total state of the system , @xmath117 , is a pure state .",
    "if the state , @xmath117 , were separable with respect to three spatial modes it would be a product state as follows @xmath118 .",
    "if region @xmath49 were then traced out , the resulting state , @xmath119 , would also be a pure state , @xmath120 and would consequently have unit purity , @xmath121=1 $ ] .",

    "therefore , when the purity is less than one , @xmath122<1 $ ] , we can conclude that the state of three spatial modes , @xmath117 , was not a product state to begin with .",
    "this means that a bec of fixed particle number at zero - temperature is always entangled , because a state of separable regions would have unit purity .",
    "we can also investigate multi - mode spatial entanglement to fully understand how the choice of spatial modes affects the detection of entanglement in the bec phase transition .",
    "we will investigate entanglement between three spatial modes , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath49 , that together occupy an entire confining volume , @xmath123 , at finite temperatures , @xmath44 .",
    "we can no longer use the purity measure of entanglement as this is only valid for bipartite states .",
    "however , there are suitable entanglement witnesses that detect genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "an entanglement witness , @xmath124 is an observable that , by our notation , has a positive expectation value for entangled states , @xmath125>0 $ ] , and a negative expectation value for separable states .",
    "we will use the witness @xmath126 , where @xmath127 , as our single particle state , @xmath128 , belongs to the @xmath129 class of tripartite entangled states . as we are studying a continuous variable system , we shall write the entanglement witness , @xmath130 , in terms of field operators , @xmath54 and @xmath92 , as @xmath131 where we have used @xmath132 . here",
    "@xmath93 takes the role of a detector profile that specifies how we average over the set of points included in the mode .",

    "this is because while @xmath7 detects entanglement , it does not differentiate between single - particle and @xmath13-particle entangled states , ( see section [ becphasetrans ] ) .",
    "the entanglement between three spatial modes , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath49 , depends solely on the behaviour of the spatial coherence between each pair of regions , as here we have not traced out any of the gas .",

    "region b , however , can become much smaller , @xmath146 and still be entangled to both regions @xmath34 and @xmath49 , due to it s position in between regions @xmath34 and @xmath49 .",
    "this is because the probability for particles to occupy a small region in the centre of the trap is much higher than the probability to occupy the same small region at the edge of the trap .    to see more",
    "clearly why this is the case let us consider a general @xmath129 state , @xmath147 .",
    "let the coefficient , @xmath148 become much less than the other two coefficients , @xmath149 .",
    "the first term , whose coefficient is @xmath148 , can be set to zero .",
    "the first subsystem ( denoted by the first position in the kets ) is then no longer entanged to the other two and the @xmath129-witness , @xmath124 , no longer detects any tripartite entanglement .",
    "this is what , in fact , happens here when one or two of the regions becomes relatively small compared to the remaining one(s ) .",
    "however , the ground state of the gas is still entangled even when our witness @xmath134 does not detect it .",
    "this is because the spatial modes chosen were not the optimum choice , i.e. we could have uncovered entanglement between smaller regions of space by choosing multiple ( @xmath150 ) small spatial modes .",
    "it is an open problem how the amount of entanglement scales with an increasing number of regions .      in between high and zero temperatures",
    "there is an increase in the thermal de - broglie wavelength of the atoms .",
    "the atoms spread over neighbouring regions of space and quantum coherences form between them . at a certain temperature the coherences between the three spatial modes will become big enough so that the regions become entangled .",
    "we will see that entanglement forms below the critical temperature for condensation .",
    "let us consider a non - interacting bose gas of @xmath151 atoms , confined in a three - dimensional uniform potential of volume , @xmath152 , where @xmath153 nm .",
    "the space is divided into three regions , @xmath34 , @xmath49 and @xmath35 of lengths @xmath154 and @xmath141 respectively along one axis and of length @xmath144 along the other two axes .",
    "region @xmath35 is situated in between regions @xmath34 and @xmath49 .",
    "the atoms occupy the momentum modes @xmath155 .",
    "the critical temperature for condensation is @xmath156nk .",
    "[ fig : maxtempent ] shows the maximum temperature , @xmath157 , for which entanglement exists as a function of the size of region @xmath35 , @xmath141 ( which is also the separation of regions @xmath34 and @xmath49 ) , as determined by the entanglement witness , @xmath134 , eq .",
    "( [ entwit ] ) .",
    "the warmest temperature that entanglement survives at is @xmath158nk , which corresponds to the region sizes @xmath159 and @xmath160 . at this point",
    "there is approximately equal probability , @xmath161 , for the bosons to occupy any region , i.e. @xmath162 . at zero temperature this spatial configuration of modes , @xmath163 ,",
    "represents a state with the maximum amount of possible entanglement , as maximally entangled states usually posses equal probability amplitudes . i.e. the maximally entangled bell states all have probability amplitudes @xmath164 .",
    "as the temperature increases from zero kelvin , a fraction of the bosons occupy higher momentum modes and the entangled state of three spatial modes becomes increasingly mixed . at some temperature ,",
    "these quantum states become so mixed that they are no longer entangled .",
    "states with only a small amount of entanglement at @xmath115 need only a small amount of extra mixedness to become separable so are destroyed by only a small amount of heat .",
    "in contrast consider the entangled states with some maximum amount of entanglement at @xmath115 .",
    "the entanglement in these states survives to higher temperatures as they tolerate more mixing before they become separable .",
    "as the number of bosons , @xmath13 , in the gas increases the critical temperature for condensation , @xmath165 also increases for a fixed volume .",
    "how does the maximum temperature for single - particle entanglement , @xmath157 , change as @xmath13 increases ?",
    "naturally , @xmath157 increases with @xmath13 and @xmath165 , but the ratio , @xmath166 also tends to unity , @xmath167 .",
    "thus , as the number of bosons in the condensate , @xmath13 , becomes very large , @xmath168 , the maximum temperature for entanglement @xmath157 tends to the critical temperature for condensation , @xmath169 . in this limit , and for the optimum region configuration described above i.e. when @xmath170 , spatial entanglement and spatial coherence become equivalent . in other words entanglement between three regions of space and spatial coherence between the same regions both exist for an identical set of parameters .",
    "let us summarise the results of this paper .",
    "initially we used a purity measure of entanglement to derive an entanglement witness , @xmath84 , eq .",
    "( [ entinequality ] ) , that indicated whether two spatial modes of a non - interacting bosonic gas of fixed particle number were entangled .",
    "the witness , @xmath84 , is parameterised by the one - body reduced density matrix , @xmath8 , that measures the spatial coherence between points @xmath4 and @xmath9 , and the probability to occupy one of the regions @xmath88 .",
    "when the two regions occupy the entire confining geometry ( @xmath89 ) the entanglement witness , @xmath84 , depends only on the one - body density matrix and entanglement and spatial coherence are equivalent .",
    "if the probability to occupy a region is less than a half , @xmath171 , then spatial coherence between the regions is only necessary for entanglement .",
    "we plotted the results for the case of a cigar - shaped harmonic potential and as expected entanglement only exists below the critical temperature for condensation , @xmath165 , when there is coherence between two separated regions .",
    "the amount of entanglement increases when the spatial modes are closer together because the population is located at the centre of the trap .",
    "if there were an equal probability to find bosons at every point in the trap there would be an equal amount of entanglement between all regions of space .",
    "the non - local quantum part of the one - bodied reduced density matrix is as expected very long ranged .    to gain a greater understanding of entanglement in the bec phase transition it was also useful to consider multi - mode entanglement , as three or more spatial modes can still be entangled even when two spatial modes are not .",
    "we derived a second entanglement witness , @xmath134 , to detect entanglement between three spatial modes using an existing entanglement witness , @xmath124 . in this case",
    "the three regions occupied the entire confining volume so the witness , @xmath134 was parameterised exclusively by the one - body reduced density matrix . the probability to occupy all three regions must be of the same order for entanglement to exist . at zero temperature , @xmath115 ,",
    "the state with maximum entanglement corresponds to the region configuration that allows the probabilities for occupation of each region to be equal , @xmath170 .",
    "the entanglement in this state was also more robust to mixing and survived until the highest temperatures .    in the introduction we spoke about two conjectures concerning the entanglement in quantum phase transitions .",
    "namely that entanglement is responsible for the long - range correlations that develop in the transverse ising and xy models at the quantum critical point and that at such critical points the system is maximally , or _",
    "critically _ , entangled @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these conjectures in the context of the bec phase transition .",
    "even though the phase transitions are very different in nature , our results may act as a guide for how entanglement behaves in other such critical systems .",
    "in contrast to a quantum phase transition , the bec phase transition is classical and is driven by thermal fluctuations .",
    "one could , however , induce the bec phase transition at zero temperature by increasing the density of bosons until their wavefunctions start to overlap , and a bec was formed .",
    "it is therefore sensible to compare the entanglement properties of becs at zero temperature to entanglement in quantum phase transitions .",
    "another difference between entanglement in becs and entanglement in discrete lattice type systems is the couplings between sites . in discrete systems",
    "one normally considers nearest neighbour couplings whereas in a bec there are pairwise couplings between all regions .",
    "the entanglement structure is far richer in a bec , with entanglement stretching well beyond neighbouring regions .",
    "entanglement below the critical temperature for condensation occurs due to the long - range correlations that distribute bosons coherently over the spatial modes .",
    "we have seen that spatial coherence is a precursor to entanglement and we know , of course , that the entanglement does not cause the spatial correlations . when the probability for bosons to occupy each region is equal , entanglement and spatial coherence between the regions are equivalent and the system has the maximum possible amount of entanglement . in discrete systems , where the sites are pre - defined , could entanglement and spatial coherence also be equivalent ? at criticality long - range correlations do occur throughout the system , but one would need a suitable multi - partite entanglement witness to fully characterise the behaviour of entanglement between all the sites at that point .",
    "let us finally discuss two possible extensions of this work .",
    "firstly one could characterise the behaviour of entanglement between @xmath172 spatial modes .",
    "we know that genuine multi - mode entanglement only exists below the critical temperature for condensation , due to the requirement of spatial coherence between distant regions . however , it is interesting to ask whether there could be entanglement above the critical temperature for condensation .",
    "consider regions smaller than the boson s de broglie wavelength , so that there was spatial coherence between neighbouring modes , entanglement of the whole system could then be built up from bipartite entanglement , to form some sort of entangled graph state .",
    "a second reason for understanding how spatial coherence is related to entanglement lies in the fact that it is becoming increasingly accepted that bec like coherences can occur in systems at higher temperatures . in this case",
    "the systems interacts strongly with the environment and a constant supply of energy lift the systems modes out of the planck distribution causing the strong excitation of a single mode @xcite .",
    "this is particularly interesting when one realises that biological systems may show such behaviour where quantum coherence is thought to be present in energy transfer in photosynthetic systems @xcite .",
