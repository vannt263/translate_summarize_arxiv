    "the final decade of the last century has seen the discovery of ultra - cool dwarfs .",
    "the low temperatures of these objects cause their spectra to appear distinct from those of the latest m dwarfs .",
    "thus the new spectral class `` l '' was introduced @xcite in which tio and vo give way to lines of neutral alkalis and hydrides .",
    "yet cooler objects exhibit methane absorption , and are classed as `` t '' or methane dwarfs .",
    "the main question was to establish if any of these cool dwarfs was substellar , i.e. whether they represented the long sought - after brown dwarfs .",
    "the critical parameter ",
    "mass  is not directly observable , so it must be derived from the stellar evolution models @xcite as a function of object s temperature and age .",
    "temperature is derived from spectra , while the age can sometimes be independently estimated if the cool dwarf is a member of a binary or a cluster .",
    "while all t dwarfs are considered too cool to sustain hydrogen burning , l dwarfs can be either stars or brown dwarfs .",
    "most lines of evidence point to the conclusion that l dwarfs later than l4 are brown dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for the earlier l dwarfs , as for several very late m dwarfs , the presence of lithium can serve as an indicator of substellar nature @xcite , since it is destroyed in objects having masses @xmath3 .    from the observational point of view , the recent discovery of a large number of l dwarfs ( 250 are listed in d.  kirkpatrick s database updated on 2002 dec 19 ) and t dwarfs ( 40 are listed in burgasser s archive updated on 2002 dec 22 ) , was facilitated by large area sky surveys  primarily 2mass and denis in the infrared , and sdss in the optical .",
    "l dwarfs are characterized by red infrared colors and faint or invisible optical counterparts , while the t dwarfs have quite blue infrared colors , but are also very faint or invisible in optical surveys .",
    "this reversal of infrared colors between l and t dwarfs makes infrared surveys inappropriate for the search for the l ",
    "t `` transitional '' objects",
    ". the reversal does not affect red optical bands like @xmath4 and @xmath5 , enabling sdss to fill this gap @xcite .",
    "`` transitional '' objects are now considered to be early t dwarfs @xcite . yet",
    "other l dwarfs are found in targeted searches for companions to nearby stars @xcite .",
    "finally , l dwarfs are found in new proper motion surveys @xcite .",
    "the l dwarf we present in this paper , lsr0602 + 3910 , was first detected as a new high proper motion object .",
    "its discovery is described in  [ sec : disc ] , and the observations confirming its nature are described in  [ sec : obs ] . in ",
    "[ sec : ana ] we analyze and interpret the observations , and in  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss some further aspects of this discovery .",
    "unlike most l - dwarf candidates that are selected from infrared or deep optical surveys , lsr0602 + 3910 ( in further text lsr0602 ) , was identified as a new high proper motion star close to the galactic plane .",
    "the detection procedure relies on superblink software @xcite  an automated blink comparator working on dss1 and dss2 . after aligning the images from the two epochs ,",
    "superblink subtracts them , thus revealing stars with significant motion .",
    "the search in @xcite concentrated on low galactic latitudes and stars with proper motions exceeding @xmath6 , matching the cut of the _ luyten half - second _ ( lhs ) catalog @xcite .",
    "lhs contains some 3600 stars with @xmath7 , and is fairly complete to @xmath8 in the northern skies and away from the plane @xcite .",
    "however , within @xmath9 of the plane , lhs stops being complete at @xmath10 , because of the difficulties that luyten had with identifying moving stars in crowded fields . here",
    "superblink takes over . in @xcite , besides recovering 460 lhs stars , 141 new stars are found with @xmath11 .",
    "lhs is known to be a valuable source of nearby stars , white dwarfs and subdwarfs .",
    "adding 30% of such stars should add a similar percentage of the type of `` interesting '' stars present in lhs .",
    "a spectroscopic campaign was undertaken to ascertain the nature of these new stars . in @xcite spectra",
    "were presented for 105 stars , revealing many m dwarfs , and a number of subdwarfs and white dwarfs .",
    "lsr1835 + 3259 was found to be only 6 pc away .",
    "the spectrum of lsr0602 was not taken at that time .",
    "another approach to classifying proper motion stars and getting approximate photometric distances employs the reduced proper motion diagram where the color is an optical to infrared color ( e.g. @xmath12 ) .",
    "this method was described in @xcite and was applied to the nltt catalog @xcite .",
    "a wide color baseline allows even crude photographic magnitudes to be used . matching the @xcite sample to the 2mass second incremental data release ( 2idr ) produced 52 matches .",
    "eleven stars ( most probably faint white dwarfs ) did not have a match in 2idr areas .",
    "one object stood apart for its very red color .",
    "lsr0602 had 2mass @xmath13 , indicating a possible l dwarf .",
    "the spectra of lsr0602 were obtained at the 3 m shane telescope at lick observatory , using the kast spectrograph .",
    "we observed through a @xmath14 slit , and used the 600 lines / mm grating blazed at 7500 , giving 6300 - 9100  coverage at 2.3 / pix .",
    "dome flats were taken after each telescope pointing to correct the fringing pattern of the thinned ccd in the red .",
    "comparison arc spectra were taken after each pointing as well .",
    "three 500 s exposures were obtained on 2002 nov 28 with thin cirrus , and three 500 s exposures on nov 30 , of which one was affected by clouds .",
    "our effective exposure time is @xmath15 s. the 2d spectra are reduced and extracted using iraf .",
    "we have not corrected for telluric absorption .",
    "the individual spectra are combined , weighted by the intensity .",
    "the combined spectrum , shown in figure [ fig : sp ] , is flux - normalized , using the spectrum of the spectroscopic standard bd + 28 4211 .      during the same run , on 2002 nov 27 and dec 2 , we obtained images of lsr0602 on the 1 m nickel telescope with dewar#2 ccd .",
    "the first night was photometric , but the second was not .",
    "we derived zero points of the photometric calibration for the first night , while the airmass coefficients and linear and quadratic color - terms were derived from a large number of johnson - kron - cousins standards observed on dec 3 , including the @xmath16 standard g 45 - 20 .",
    "calibration errors are expected to be @xmath17 mag in all three bands ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "since the second night was not photometric , only relative photometry was performed .",
    "owing to the large number of stars in the field , the extinction from clouds was well determined .",
    "aperture corrections were also determined precisely from a number of stars .",
    "photometry is summarized in table [ tab : lsr ] .",
    "uncertainty in @xmath19 is dominated by photon noise , in @xmath20 by the uncertain estimate of the cloud extinction ( since no @xmath20-band images of the field were obtained under photometric conditions ) , and in @xmath21 from the uncertainty in @xmath22 color used to convert from instrumental magnitudes .",
    "we visually classify the spectrum of lsr0602 ( figure [ fig : sp ] ) as type l1 , based on templates and descriptions of l subtypes in @xcite .",
    "lsr0602 does not appear consistent with l0 because of the strengths of rb i and cs i line doublets and the depth of the feh @xmath23 band head .",
    "lsr0602 can not be l2 because the tio @xmath24 band head is still present , while the tio @xmath25 is of similar depth as the crh @xmath26 band head .",
    "the only unusual feature for an l1 spectrum is the relatively narrow width of the k i @xmath27 doublet .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the lsr0602 spectrum is the detection of lithium absorption ( li i @xmath28 ) .",
    "as can be seen from the inset in figure [ fig : sp ] , the line seems to stand out , but the region is noisy . the feature can also be seen in most individual spectra .",
    "the centroid of the line in the combined spectrum lies at 6710 , 2  from the nominal position .",
    "lines at longer wavelengths mostly lie within 1  of their nominal positions .",
    "the dispersion solution has an rms value of 0.7 , so the `` offset '' of the li i line is most likely an artifact .",
    "the li i line was recently independently observed ( k.  cruz & i.  n.  reid 2003 , private communication ) , confirming its brown dwarf status .",
    "we measure the equivalent width ( ew ) of li i to be @xmath29 , which is typical for l1 dwarfs @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "only 10% of l1 dwarfs have li i , while 30% exhibit @xmath30 emission @xcite .",
    "we do not detect @xmath30 .",
    "since li i is visible only in younger l dwarfs ( @xmath31 gyr ) , while @xmath32 tends to be present in older ones @xcite , the absence of @xmath30 in lsr0602 is consistent with it being a brown dwarf .",
    "so are the low tangential and radial velocities , indicating young disk membership .      according to kirkpatrick s list , with a 2mass magnitude of @xmath33",
    ", lsr0602 comes second in brightness only to one other l dwarf : 2massw j0746425 + 200032 ( or 2m0746 ) .",
    "2m0746 is one of the earliest l dwarfs discovered @xcite , and has @xmath34 . even in the discovery paper ,",
    "the trigonometric parallax of 2m0746 was available , indicating an absolute magnitude @xmath35 mag brighter than the `` main sequence '' , and thus a possible binary .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite who imaged 2m0746 with the _ hst _ planetary camera , and found a companion a mere @xmath36 away .",
    "the observations were made in _",
    "bands close to @xmath19 and @xmath21 , so the model - dependent extrapolation is needed to determine magnitudes of the components in other bands . using the estimated @xmath37 from @xcite , the primary in 2m0746 acquires @xmath38 , making it @xmath39 fainter than lsr0602 .",
    "the 2m0746 system does not show lithium absorption ( see table [ tab : dist ] ) , therefore it may , or may not be substellar .",
    "the question to ask is whether lsr0602 is also perhaps a close binary .",
    "our @xmath21-band image of lsr0602 taken in @xmath40 seeing is consistent with a point source .",
    "since the magnitude difference between the components would be smaller in @xmath41-band , we also examined 2mass images .",
    "while the fwhm of 2m0746 has a value which is @xmath42 larger than that of the surrounding stars , lsr0602 has the same fwhm as other stars .",
    "this does not rule out binarity , but puts stronger constraints on it .",
    "future observations with adaptive optics or optical interferometers might find a companion , if one exists .",
    "the determination of the trigonometric parallax would test lsr0602 s possible binarity as well .    while not surpassed in brightness among the brown dwarfs of l - type ,",
    "lsr0602 is fainter than the m9.5 brown dwarf lp944 - 20 @xcite , and comparable to the m8.5 brown dwarf 2massi j0335020 + 234235 @xcite and the l dwarf @xmath43 ind b @xcite .",
    "we determine the distance to lsr0602 in several ways .",
    "since we measure the @xmath21 magnitude with a high precision , we can combine it with the 2mass @xmath44 to get @xmath45 , and use the @xcite @xmath46 relation ( calibrated with the largest available sample of trigonometric parallaxes ) to obtain a photometric distance .",
    "thus we get @xmath47 pc , where the error is due to the dispersion in the @xmath46 relation of 0.23 mag , and not from @xmath48 .",
    "another relation given by @xcite relates spectral subclass to @xmath49 . with it",
    "we get @xmath50 pc , where again the error is from the 0.25 mag scatter in the relation . that the two independent methods yield the same distance estimate is quite reassuring .",
    "we have also derived a distance from @xmath51 by asking that it on average ( for the entire 250 l dwarf sample ) produce the same distance as the spectroscopic method . in this way",
    "we get @xmath52 pc . however , it is well known that @xmath51 color is an inferior indicator of the absolute magnitude .",
    "the average of the @xmath53 and spectroscopic distance estimates gives @xmath2 pc .",
    "how does lsr0602 rank in distance compared to the other 250 l dwarfs ? to answer this , we compute the spectroscopic distances for the entire sample .",
    "the top of the list is shown in table [ tab : dist ] .",
    "we also list trigonometric parallaxes if available .",
    "lsr0602 ranks eighth judging from spectroscopic distances , however , due to binarity , 2m0746 actually lies farther . in other cases ,",
    "trigonometric distances are in a very good agreement with spectroscopic estimates .",
    "another five l dwarfs have spectroscopic distances within @xmath54 of the lsr0602 estimate , but none of them has a trigonometric parallax .",
    "of l dwarfs estimated to be closer than lsr0602 , all except one have optical spectra , with none showing lithium .",
    "lsr0602 is a very bright l dwarf , yet it has escaped detection so far .",
    "the reasons for this become obvious if we plot the distribution of the 250 l dwarfs in the galactic coordinate system ( left panel of figure [ fig : map_count ] ) .",
    "the galactic center lies in the center of the map , and l dwarfs are plotted as dots of three different sizes .",
    "the largest ( @xmath55 ) , correspond to the limits of sample a of @xcite and the bright @xcite sample .",
    "medium dots ( @xmath56 ) , correspond to the limits of @xcite and the 2mass completeness limit .",
    "fainter objects are plotted with small dots .",
    "we notice that there is a `` zone of avoidance '' @xmath57 wide on each side of the plane .",
    "it is right there ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , in the left corner of the map , where lsr0602 is located ( star symbol ) .",
    "most searches for l dwarfs purposely avoided the region around the galactic plane in order to reduce the number of candidate objects ( mostly reddened stars ) .",
    "another region that is conspicuously devoid of l dwarfs is located below the plane .",
    "this region actually corresponds to part of the sky around the south celestial pole that was imaged only later by 2mass , and is not a part of the 2idr , where most searches concentrated .",
    "we can try to estimate the number of l dwarfs missed because searches have been avoiding the plane . to make the estimate as free of bias as possible",
    ", we select only l dwarfs lying within the 2mass 2idr area",
    ". this amounts to 68% of all l dwarfs , regardless of the magnitude range .",
    "since this percentage is considerably higher than the 2idr sky coverage of 50% , this confirms that most discoveries come from 2idr , and justifies our restriction to it .",
    "we now include only @xmath56 objects , again in order to mimic the properties of searches based on 2mass .",
    "this leaves 133 l dwarfs . in order to obtain the distribution of l dwarfs as a function of latitude , we want to correct the raw counts per bin by the fraction of the sky in that bin covered by the 2mass 2idr . depending on the latitude range ,",
    "this fraction varies from 38% to 67% . finally , in order to have each bin cover the same area , we count in bins linear in @xmath60 .",
    "thus each of the 20 bins covers @xmath61 .",
    "the distribution is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : map_count ] .",
    "the error bars come from the counting statistics .",
    "first , we confirm that there are no l dwarfs in the @xmath62 region .",
    "had lsr0602 been discovered previously ( and it does lie in the 2idr ) , it would have raised the value in the @xmath63 bin from 0 to @xmath64 .",
    "we also notice that the increase in the number is gradual towards the higher latitudes , and levels off at @xmath65 .",
    "there also seems to be a statistically significant asymmetry between the northern and the southern latitudes , perhaps a consequence of a less intensive spectroscopic follow - up in the southern hemisphere .",
    "from the last five bins ( northern high latitude ) , we find the average number of 20 l dwarfs per bin .",
    "this corresponds to 400 @xmath66 ) l dwarfs to @xmath56 over the entire sky .",
    "however , the 2mass coverage - corrected number of known l dwarfs is 230 @xmath67 .",
    "therefore some 40% of l dwarfs are missed in the current type of searches , mostly because the galactic plane region is avoided .",
    "we present a discovery of a very bright l - type brown dwarf .",
    "its space velocity is consistent with the young disk .",
    "since it is also one of the closest l dwarfs , it should be included in a parallax program .",
    "lsr0602 is an important target for follow - up investigations . due to its brightness",
    ", the blue part of the spectrum and photometric variability can be easily studied .",
    "high resolution imaging will be needed to investigate possible binarity . finally , due to its position in the sky that has been so far neglected",
    ", the discovery indicates that many interesting nearby objects still await discovery , especially using searches based on proper motion .",
    "this research program is being supported by nsf grant ast-0087313 at the american museum of natural history , as part of the nstars program .",
