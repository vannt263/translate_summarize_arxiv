    "one of the central challenges in performing a physics analysis is to accurately model the distributions of observable quantities @xmath1 in terms of the physical parameters of interest @xmath2 as well as other parameters @xmath3 needed to describe detector effects such as resolution and efficiency .",
    "the resulting model consists of a `` probability density function '' ( pdf ) @xmath4 that is normalized over the allowed range of the observables @xmath1 with respect to the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "experience in the babar experiment has demonstrated that the development of a suitable model , together with the tools needed to exploit it , is a frequent bottleneck of a physics analysis .",
    "for example , some analyses initially used binned fits to small samples to avoid the cost of developing an unbinned fit from scratch . to address this problem , a general - purpose toolkit for physics analysis modeling was started in 1999 .",
    "this project fills a gap in the particle physicists tool kit that had not previously been addressed .",
    "a common observation is that once physicists are freed from the constraints of developing their model from scratch , they often use many observables simultaneously and introduce large numbers of parameters in order to optimally use the available data and available control samples .",
    "the final stages of most particle physics analysis are performed in an interactive data analysis framework such as paw@xcite or root@xcite .",
    "these applications provide an interactive environment that is programmable via interpreted macros and have access to a graphical toolkit designed for visualization of particle physics data .",
    "the roofit toolkit extends the root analysis environment by providing , in addition to basics visualization and data processing tools , a language to describe data models .",
    "the core features of roofit are    * a natural and self - documenting vocabulary to build a model in terms of its building blocks ( e.g. , exponential decay , argus function , gaussian resolution ) and how they are assembled ( e.g. , addition , composition , convolution ) .",
    "a template is provided for users to add new building - block pdfs specific to their problem domain . * a data description language to specify the observable quantities being modeled using descriptive titles , units , and any cut ranges .",
    "various data types are supported including real valued and discrete valued ( e.g. decay mode ) .",
    "data can be read from ascii files or root ntuples .",
    "* generic support for fitting any model to a dataset using a ( weighted ) unbinned or binned maximum likelihood , or @xmath0 approach * tools for plotting data with correctly calculated errors , poisson or binomial , and superimposing correctly normalized projections of a multidimensional model , or its components .",
    "* tools for creating a event samples from any model with monte carlo techniques , with some variables possibly taken from a prototype dataset , e.g. to more accurately model the statistical fluctuations in a particular sample . * computational efficiency .",
    "models coded in roofit should be as fast or faster than hand coded models .",
    "an array of automated optimization techniques is applied to any model without explicit need for user support . * bookkeeping tools for configuration management , automated pdf creation and automation of routine tasks such as goodness - of - fit studies .",
    "to keep the distance between a physicists mathematical description of a data model and its implementation as small as possible , the roofit interface is styled after the language of mathematics . the object - oriented root environment is ideally suited for this approach : each mathematical object is represented by a c++ software object .",
    "table [ tab : map ] illustrates the correspondence between some basic mathematical concepts and roofit classes .",
    ".correspondence between mathematical concepts and roofit classes . [ cols=\">,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     similar modifications can be made to @xmath0 definitions .",
    "it is also possible to develop an entirely different goodness - of - fit quantity by implementing a new class that derives from rooabsoptgoodnessoffit",
    "as the complexity of fits increases , efficient use of computing resources becomes increasingly important . to speed up the evaluation of probability density functions , optimization techniques such as value caching and",
    "factorized calculations can be used .",
    "traditionally such optimizations require a substantial programming effort due to the large amount of bookkeeping involved , and often result in incomplete use of available optimization techniques due to lack of time or expertise .",
    "ultimately such optimizations represent a compromise between development cost , speed and flexibility .",
    "roofit radically changes this equation as the object - oriented structure of its pdfs allows centrally provided algorithms to analyze any pdfs structure and to apply generic optimization techniques to it .",
    "examples of the various optimization techniques are    * _ precalculation of constant terms . _ + in a fit , parts of a pdf may depend exclusively on constant parameters .",
    "these components can be precalculated once and used throughout the fit session . *   _ caching and lazy evaluation_. + functions are only recalculated if any of their input has changed .",
    "the actual calculation is deferred to the moment that the function value is requested . *   _ factorization .",
    "_ + objects representing a sum , product or convolution of other pdfs , can often be factorized from a single n - dimensional problem to a product of n easier - to - solve 1-dimensional problems . *",
    "_ parallelization .",
    "_ + calculation of likelihoods and other goodness - of - fit quantities can , due to their repetitive nature , easily be partitioned in to set of partial results that can be combined a posteriori .",
    "roofit automates this process and can calculate partial results in separate processes , exploiting all available cpu power on multi - cpu hosts .",
    "optimizations are performed automatically prior to each potentially cpu intensive operation , and are tuned to the specific operation that follows .",
    "this realizes the maximum available optimization potential for every operation at no cost for the user .",
    "as analysis projects grow in complexity , users are often confronted with an increasing amount of logistical issues and bookkeeping tasks that may ultimately limit the complexity of their analysis .",
    "roofit provides a variety of tools to ease the creation and management of large numbers of datasets and probability density functions such as    * _ discrete variables . _",
    "+ a discrete variable in roofit is a variable with a finite set of named states .",
    "the naming of states , instead of enumerating them , facilitates symbolic notation and manipulation .",
    "discrete variables can be used to consolidate multiple datasets into a single dataset , where the discrete variables states label the subset to which each events belongs . * _ automated pdf building . _",
    "+ a common analysis technique is to classify the events of a dataset @xmath5 into subsets @xmath6 , and simultaneously fit a set of pdfs @xmath7 to these subsets @xmath6 . in cases",
    "were individually adjusted pdfs @xmath7 can describe the data better than a single global pdf @xmath8 , a better statistical sensitivity can be obtained in the fit .",
    "often , such pdfs do not differ in structure , just in the value of their parameters .",
    "roofit offers a utility class to automate the creation the the pdfs @xmath7 : given a prototype pdf @xmath8 and a set of rules that explain how the prototype should be altered for use in each subset ( e.g. each subset should have its own copy of parameter foo ) this utility builds entire set of pdfs @xmath7",
    ". it can handle an unlimited set of prototype pdfs , specialization rules and data subdivisions .",
    "* _ project configuration management . _",
    "+ advanced data analysis projects often need to store and retrieve projection configuration , such as initial parameters values , names of input files and other parameter that control the flow of execution .",
    "roofit provides tools to store such information in a standardized way in easy - to - read ascii files .",
    "the use of standardized project management tools promotes structural similarity between analyses and increases users abilities to understand other roofit projects and to exchange ideas and code .",
    "roofit was initially released as roofittools in 1999 in the babar collaboration and started with a small subset of its present functionality .",
    "extensive stress testing of the initial design by babar physicists in 1999 and 2000 revealed a great desire to have a tool like roofit , but identified a number of bottlenecks and weaknesses , that could only be mitigated by a complete redesign .",
    "the redesign effort was started in late 2000 and has introduced many of the core features that define roofit in its current form : strong mathematical styling of the user interface , nearly complete absence of any implementation - level restrictions of any pdf building or utilization methods , efficient automated function optimization and powerful data and pdf management tools .",
    "the new package , renamed , has been available to babar users since fall 2001 .",
    "the functionality has been quite stable since early 2002 and most recent efforts have been spent on stabilization , fine tuning of the user interface and documentation . at present five tutorials comprising more than 250 slides and 20 educational macros are available , as well as a reference manual detailing the interface of all roofit classes .",
    "since october 2002 roofit is available to the entire hep community : the code and documentation repository has been moved from babar to sourceforge , an opensource development platform , which provides easy and equal access to all hep users .",
    "( http://roofit.sourceforge.net ) ,",
    "since the package s initial release roofit has been adopted by most babar physics analyses .",
    "analysis topics include searches for rare b decays , measurements of b branching fractions and cp - violating rate asymmetries , time - dependent analyses of b and d decays to measure lifetime , mixing , and symmetry properties , and dalitz analyses of b decays to determine form factors .",
    "the enthusiastic adoption of roofit within babar demonstrates the clear need and benefits of such tools in particle physics . since its migration to sourceforge",
