    "a traditional way of performing this task approximately is to use the semi - classical rydberg - klein - rees ( rkr ) method @xcite ; a more precise strategy called inverse perturbation analysis ( ipa ) has been suggested by kosman and hinze @xcite and a program implementing this approach was presented by pashov _",
