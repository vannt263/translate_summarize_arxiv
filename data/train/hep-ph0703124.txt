    "semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons on nuclear targets is widely used for studies of the hadronization process  @xcite . it is most effective to observe at moderate energies of the virtual photon , when the formation time of the hadron is comparable with the nuclear radius .",
    "+ hadronization is the process through which partons , created in an elementary interaction , turn into the hadrons that are observed experimentally . according to theoretical estimates",
    "the hadronization process occurs over length scales that vary from less than a femtometer to several tens of femtometers .",
    "hadronization in a nuclear environment is interesting due to two main reasons .",
    "first of all , it allows to study the parameters governing this process on the early stage ; on the other hand , it can provide initial conditions for the investigation of hadronization in hot nuclear matter , which arises in high energy ion - ion collisions .",
    "+ the most convenient observable measured experimentally for this process is the nuclear attenuation ( na ) ratio , which is a ratio of multiplicities on nucleus and deuterium ( per nucleon ) .",
    "next step is to find a variable which allows to present the na ratio in the most simple form .",
    "+ we propose the formation time @xmath3 as the best variable for the na and show that the data can be parametrised in the form of a linear polynomial @xmath8 .",
    "formation time @xmath3 depends on the energy of photon @xmath4 and fraction of this energy @xmath9 carried by the final hadron with energy @xmath10 .",
    "three widely known parameterizations for @xmath3 were used for the fit procedure .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , obtained from the fit , do not depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they are functions of the prehadron - nucleon and hadron - nucleon cross sections and the atomic mass number .",
    "+ the na data for pions on nitrogen and for identified hadrons on krypton nuclei obtained by the hermes experiment  @xcite were used to perform the fit .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows .",
    "nuclear attenuation in absorption model is presented in the next section . in section 3",
    "it is discussed a choice of the appropriate form for the variable @xmath3 .",
    "section 4 presents results of the fit .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the semi - inclusive dis of lepton on nucleus of atomic mass number a is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the initial ( final ) leptons , and h is the hadron observed in the final state .",
    "this process is usually investigated in terms of the na ratio , which is frequently defined as a function of two variables , @xmath4 and @xmath5 also depends on the photon virtuality @xmath13 and on the square of the hadron transverse momentum @xmath14 , in respect to the virtual photon direction .",
    "however , from the experimental data , it is known that @xmath0 is a much sensitive function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in comparison with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ] : @xmath15 usually it is investigated at precise values of one variable and average values of another .",
    "+ in case where the @xmath4 - dependence is studied , @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the average values of @xmath5 for each @xmath4 bin . and for @xmath5 - dependence @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the average values of @xmath4 for each @xmath5 bin .    in this work",
    "we adopt a model , according to which the origin of na is the absorption of the prehadron ( string , dipole ) and final hadron in the nuclear medium . in that case",
    "na ratio has the following form : @xmath20^{(a-1)}dx}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the probability that neither the prehadron produced at the dis point @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is impact parameter and @xmath24 the longitudinal coordinate ) , nor the hadron produced at point @xmath25 is absorbed by one nucleon in the nucleus ; @xmath26 is the nuclear density function with a normalization condition : @xmath27 for @xmath21 we use the one scale model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the inelastic cross sections for prehadron - nucleon and hadron - nucleon interactions , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 is the probability that on distance @xmath32 from dis point particle is a prehadron and @xmath33 is the probability that particle is a hadron .",
    "@xmath34 in analogy with survival probability for a particle having lifetime @xmath3 in a system where it travels a distance @xmath32 before decaying , @xmath31 can be expressed in form : @xmath35},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the formation time .",
    "substituting expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath33 in eq.(6 ) we obtain :    @xmath36    @xmath37 depends on @xmath4 and @xmath5 only by means of @xmath38 . + in more detail , the formation time in string models can be divided in two parts ( see , for instance , two scale model presented in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "first past is the constituent formation time @xmath39 , which defines the time elapsed from the moment of the dis untill the production of the first constituent of the final hadron .",
    "second time interval begins with the production of the first constituent until the second one , which coincides with the yo - yo or final hadron production .",
    "comparison with the experimental data shows that in the second interval , the prehadron - nucleon cross section has values close to the hadron - nucleon cross section @xmath30 . if the difference between these cross - sections is neglected , the model is reduced to one scale model with @xmath40 . in case of the improved two scale model ref  @xcite ,",
    "the prehadron - nucleon cross section reaches hadron - nucleon cross section value during a time interval @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the string tension , c is the free parameter which defines from fit . in ref",
    "@xcite it is shown that @xmath44 .",
    "transition to the one scale model takes place at c=0 and corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "one should note that any complicated absorption string model , in some approximation , can be reduced to the one scale model presented in eq.(6 ) and ( 9 ) .",
    "substituting @xmath21 in @xmath0 we obtain : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the maximal power of @xmath3 with which we are limited .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 depend on @xmath48 and nuclear density .",
    "this means , that @xmath47 vary for different nuclei . for each nucleus",
    "@xmath47 are the same for hadrons with equal values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( for instance for pions and negatively charged kaons ) .",
    "although @xmath0 is a polynomial of @xmath3 with maximal power @xmath49 , it is expected that @xmath50 . for fitting of the na data we use three expressions for @xmath0 as first , second and third order polynomials of @xmath3 : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 in order to get the information on the influence of highest order of polynomials , also @xmath54 polynomial was checked ( see section 4 ) .",
    "equation ( 10 ) shows , that within our approximation , @xmath0 is a function of @xmath3 only . in this section",
    "we will discuss the physical meaning and possible expression of the formation time @xmath3 .",
    "there are different definitions for the formation time .",
    "we define formation time as a time scale within which the prehadron - nucleon cross section reaches the value of the hadron - nucleon one . in the literature",
    "there are three qualitatively different definitions for @xmath3 . in the first extreme case",
    "it is assumed that @xmath55 ( glauber approach ) . in the second extreme case @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the nuclear radius ( energy loss model  @xcite ) . and at last , in our opinion more realistic definition of the formation time , as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 which can change from zero up to values larger than @xmath57 .",
    "experimental data seem to confirm that for moderate values of @xmath4 on the order of @xmath58 the formation time is smaller than the nuclear size , i.e. the hadronization takes place within the nucleus .",
    "we will use the formation times according to the third definition mentioned above .",
    "following expressions are used : + 1 .",
    "formation time for the leading hadron  @xcite , which follows from the energy - momentum conservation law @xmath59 where @xmath43 is the string tension ( string constant ) with numerical value @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , eq . ( 14 ) presents formation time for the hadron produced on the fast end of the string or , which is the same , for the last hadron produced from string .",
    "hadrons can be produced along whole length of the string . among them",
    ", the hadrons produced on the fast end have better chance to avoid interactions in the nucleus .",
    "formation time for the fast hadron , which is composed of characteristic formation time of the hadron @xmath61 in its rest frame @xmath62 and lorentz factor ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath63 where @xmath10 and @xmath64 are the energy and mass of the hadron @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "let us briefly discuss the factor @xmath62 .",
    "some authors assume ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath62 is a universal quantity which does not depends on the hadron type .",
    "if this assumtion is correct , then @xmath65 for the kaons is approximately 3.5 times shorter than for the pions at the same values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , although the experiment gives @xmath66 , and it is known that @xmath67 . such definition seems merely strange in framework of the absorption model .",
    "it appears more realistic that @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "the reason for this is that in the string model the meson ( baryon ) is represented as a system consisting of a quark - antiquark ( diquark ) and a gluonic string between them .",
    "the energy of the system is transfered by the gluonic string from one parton to another and back .",
    "one full cycle lasts a period of @xmath68 which we adopt as @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath65 is a universal quantity which does not depend on the hadron type .",
    "formation time following from the lund string model ref .",
    "@xcite following from equation @xmath69 with @xmath70 taken from eq.(4.21 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . ] @xmath71{\\frac{z\\nu}{\\kappa } } } . \\ ] ] one should note that all three types of formation time have similar behaviour with @xmath4 , but different behaviour with @xmath5 . at the values of @xmath5 typical for the hermes kinematics the behavior of @xmath3 defined as ( 14 ) and ( 16 )",
    "is similar , i.e. they are decreasing with the increase of @xmath5 , while @xmath3 defined as ( 15 ) is increasing with the increase of @xmath5 .",
    "a combined fit was performed for each nucleus and all hadrons having equal cross sections and , consequently , identically absorbed by nuclear matter ( the same applies to their prehadrons ) .",
    "it is worth reminding , that the inelastic cross sections of corresponding hadrons with nucleons in the moderate energy range ( @xmath72 ) have the following values : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "combined fit was performed only for the hadrons which have equal cross - sections .",
    "= 8.cm    as a result , two combined fits were performed for :    1 .",
    "positive and negative pions on nitrogen ( 26 experimental points from  @xcite ) ; 2 .   positive , negative , neutral pions and negative kaons on krypton ( 63 experimental points from  @xcite ) ; 3 .   and separate fits for : * positive kaons on krypton ( 16 experimental points  @xcite ) ; * protons on krypton ( 16 experimental points  @xcite ) and * antiprotons on krypton ( 14 experimental points  @xcite ) .",
    "the na ratios were taken in polynomial form ( 11)-(13 ) , and formation times ( lengths ) as in ( 14)-(16 ) .",
    "the results for the reduced @xmath77 denoted as @xmath78 are presented in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "one can see that for each choice of formation time and for each nucleus , the values of @xmath78 are close for the polynomials @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which means that including higher power polynomials of @xmath3 will not essentially improve the description of data . in order to test this",
    ", we calculated also @xmath54 polynomials and obtained the values of @xmath78 close to the ones in case of @xmath81 . from table",
    "[ tab : table1 ] one can see that the fit gives unexpectedly good values for @xmath78 close to unity for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and for @xmath65 the agreement is much worse .",
    "experimental points as a function of @xmath3 and results of the fit are presented in fig .",
    "[ xx1 ] for nitrogen and in figures  [ xx2 ] ,  [ xx3 ] for krypton .",
    "solid points correspond to the na ratio obtained from the experimental data for @xmath4-dependence , open points for @xmath5-dependence . for convenience",
    "we have renormalized @xmath3 to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 are the maximum values of @xmath3 for each set of data and each choice of @xmath3 expression . on each of the figures",
    "the linear polynomial is presented @xmath86 with values @xmath6 and @xmath87 = @xmath88 corresponding to the best fit .",
    "solid , dashed and dotted curves correspond to @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 polynomial fit .",
    "* based on the performed studies one can assume that na ratio is a function of formation time @xmath3 only . *",
    "three expressions for na ratio as a first , second and third order polynomials of @xmath3 were used for these studies , and the results do not show remarkable difference in their ability to describe the hermes data . *",
    "the performed analysis with three different expressions for the formation time @xmath3 shows that based on the obtained values of the reduced @xmath77 ( see table 1 ) , as well as on visual shape of the curves in figures  [ xx1 ] ,  [ xx2 ] and  [ xx3 ] , one can conclude that the two of them - @xmath82 and @xmath83 are quite appropriate , and the expression for the formation time in form of @xmath65 is ruled out . *",
    "the performed combined fits are based on the hermes na data using : @xmath89 , @xmath90 for nitrogen ; @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 for krypton ; separate fits for @xmath93 , protons and antiprotons for krypton . * because of the fact that the linear function gives about the same values @xmath78 values as second and third order one , we assume that in our approach the parameterization by linear function is well enough .    99 l.s .",
