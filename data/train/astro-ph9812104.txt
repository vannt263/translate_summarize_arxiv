    "with the advent of the hubble deep field ( @xcite ) , which imaged objects that are approximately 100 times fainter than the limit of ground based spectrographs , deriving redshifts from broadband photometry has undergone a renaissance . however , the utility of deriving galaxy redshifts from photometric data has long been known ( @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the more recently promoted redshift estimation techniques rely on fitting template spectral energy distributions to the observed galaxy magnitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative , empirical , approach was developed by connolly _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) , in which the redshift is estimated directly from the broadband magnitudes . utilizing photographic data , they were able to estimate a redshift out to @xmath3 with a measured dispersion of @xmath4 .",
    "the uncertainties in that result were dominated by the photometric errors , and simulations indicated that with improved photometry , the dispersion within the relationship could be significantly reduced .",
    "preliminary results ( @xcite ) from these data indicate that this empirical approach can recover redshifts from broadband magnitudes with a measured intrinsic dispersion of @xmath5 to @xmath6 , which is remarkably close to the asymptotic intrinsic dispersions ( @xmath7 for @xmath8 ) that were previously predicted from simulated distributions of galaxy colors .",
    "the rest of this paper extends this published analysis to higher redshifts and provides a framework for quantifying galaxy evolution .",
    "specifically , we discuss the observations and data reduction in section  [ datasection ] . in section  [ numcounts ]",
    "we present the deep , multi - band number counts from this data .",
    "the photometric redshift and corresponding error estimates are presented in section  [ photoz ] ; and the classification of the data by spectral type data is detailed in section  [ sedtype ] .",
    "we present the number redshift distribution in section  [ nofzapp ] as a simple application of the statistical approach .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion of the general technique and its applicability .",
    "the photometric data presented in this paper are located in the intersection between the _ hst  _ 5096 field and the cfrs 14 hour field ( _ i.e .  _ the groth strip ) , covering approximately 0.054 sq . degree .",
    "all of the photometric data were obtained using the prime focus ccd ( pfccd ) camera on the mayall 4 meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "the observations were performed on the nights of march 31 - april 3 , 1995 , march 18 - 20 , 1996 , and may 14 - 16 , 1996 .",
    "the pfccd uses the t2 kb ccd , a @xmath9 tektronix ccd with 24 micron pixel scale , which at @xmath10 in the 4 meter results in a scale of @xmath11pixel and a field of view of @xmath12 .",
    "the t2 kb has a measured rms read noise of @xmath13pixel ( @xcite ) , and has a high charge transfer efficiency as well as reasonable throughput in the ultra - violet .",
    "all observations were made through the broadband filters : @xmath14 , commonly referred to at kitt peak as the `` harris set '' ( _ cf .  _ figure  [ effectivefilters ] ) .",
    "these filters were chosen due to their large spectral coverage , and are commonly used in deep , sky limited broadband imaging .",
    "the total integration times for each filter are listed along with the corresponding magnitude limits in table  [ limits ] .    during the course of the program observations , the standard set of calibration data : bias frames , dark frames , and flat fields ,",
    "were taken .",
    "these data are necessary to both properly remove the instrumental signature from the data , as well as to provide real - time integrity tests for both the ccd and the electronics .",
    "multiple flat field images were taken at both the beginning and end of each night by illuminating a white screen mounted inside the dome . a visual inspection of the illumination pattern uncovered an irregularity which was manifested in the flat field images themselves .",
    "this required the construction of illumination correction images during the reduction process . for all of our program data",
    ", we utilized a short scan of fifty rows .",
    "one final concern in using the pfccd on the mayall 4 meter was maintaining a consistent focus over the image . the focus solution varied throughout the night due to temperature fluctuations , and our adopted solution was to monitor the psf within our images .",
    "the focus value for the current filter was chosen to optimize the psf at approximately one third of the radial distance outward from the center of the image .",
    "focus offsets that were determined at the beginning of each night were then applied when switching between the different program filters .",
    "the photometric data were reduced in the standard fashion and are extensively detailed elsewhere ( @xcite ) ; however , due to the relevance of the accuracy of the photometric measurements , we present a brief overview of the process .",
    "the bias pattern , which was very stable , was removed by using a global bias frame , which was constructed by combining all of the acceptable bias frames for a given run .",
    "variations in the bias level were removed using the overscan region for each individual program image . during each run ,",
    "the dark current was examined and found to be both stable and uniform ; and , as a result , we applied no corrections for dark current in any of our data frames .",
    "the small scale pixel to pixel variations were removed using dome flats , and the residual large scale gradients were removed using illumination corrections which were created from smoothed super - sky flat images .",
    "a fringe correction image was constructed from the _",
    "i  _ band sky flat to remove any fringing due to oh line emission .",
    "cosmic rays ( radiation events ) were removed both by looking for deviant pixels , and by utilizing a pixel rejection strategy during the image stacking phase .",
    "cosmetic defects were corrected by linearly interpolating over them .",
    "any charge depletions introduced into the images by the ccd electronics were corrected ( _ cf .  _",
    "brunner 1997 ) , reducing any remaining variations to a few tenths of a percent .    before combining the images ,",
    "the geometric distortions were mapped using a third order polynomial with cross terms fit to nine reference stars .",
    "the images were transformed to the reference image , and stacked using signal - to - noise weighting for each separate run .",
    "the final stacked images for each of the three runs were also registered , stacked , and trimmed in a similar manner .",
    "the final image section for the deep stacked region is 1641 rows by 1943 columns , or @xmath15 sq . degree .",
    "all photometric calibrations were done using the april 1995 dataset which included published standard star fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "once the calibration frames were reduced , a curve of growth was generated for each standard star in concentric apertures of diameters from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "all standard stars for which the curve of growth converged were used to determine the photometric solution . a linear regression on the published stellar magnitude , the instrumental magnitude , the airmass , and a color term was performed , and the result translated to a one second standard exposure .",
    "we transformed our magnitude system to the ab system ( @xcite ) using published transformations ( @xcite ) .    during the",
    "registration and stacking phase of the data reduction , both photometric and non - photometric frames were combined . as a result ,",
    "the photometric calibration required a direct cross calibration between the stacked image and a photometric calibrated reference image .",
    "this cross calibration was done using a large number of high signal to noise reference stars in order to derive the photometric relationship between the two frames .",
    "the dispersion in the cross calibration relationship between the stacked and reference frames was a few hundredths in each band , and our overall intrinsic photometric accuracy was better than two percent .",
    "source detection and photometry were performed using sextractor version 2.0.8 ( @xcite ) with the appropriate correction for the background estimation bug applied ( @xcite ) .",
    "sextractor was chosen for its ability to detect objects in one image and analyze the corresponding pixels in a separate image ; which , when applied uniformly to multi - band data , generates a matched aperture dataset .",
    "our detection image was constructed from the @xmath14  images using a @xmath18 process ( @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , this process involves convolving each input image with a gaussian kernel matched to the seeing .",
    "the convolved images were squared , and normalized so that they had zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the four processed images ( corresponding to the original @xmath14  images ) were coadded , forming the @xmath18 detection image .",
    "a histogram of the pixel distribution in the @xmath18 image was created , and compared to a @xmath18 function with four degrees of freedom ( which corresponds to the sky pixel distribution ) .",
    "the `` object '' pixel distribution was generated by subtracting the `` sky '' pixel distribution from the actual pixel distribution .",
    "the bayesian detection threshold was set equivalent to the intersection of the `` sky '' and `` object '' distributions ( _ i.e .",
    "_ where the object pixel flux becomes dominant ) .",
    "to convert this empirical threshold for use with sextractor , we had to scale the threshold ( which is a flux per pixel value ) into a surface brightness threshold ( which is in magnitudes per square arcsecond ) .      detecting and analyzing faint objects in an image is hindered by many different effects , including object superposition , noise fluctuations , as well as redshift and evolutionary effects .",
    "these factors can prevent objects from being detected ( confidence ) , introduce false detections ( contamination ) , and affect the accuracy of the photometric measurements .",
    "the standard method for quantifying the reduction in the detection efficiency is through a heavy utilization of simulations : either through the simulation of an entire image , or through the addition of simulated or real images to the actual object frame . in order to determine the completeness limits in a model independent manner",
    ", we adopted the latter approach .    we , therefore , added one hundred artificially generated galaxies to the final stacked image .",
    "the magnitudes of the artificial galaxies were drawn uniformly from a one half magnitude interval ( _ i.e .  _",
    "@xmath19 ) .",
    "the new image was processed in an identical manner to the original image , and the resultant catalog was cross - identified with the input artificial galaxy catalog using both a proximity and magnitude match criteria .",
    "this process was repeated ten times for each half - magnitude bin in each filter over the relevant range of magnitudes , and the mean and one sigma deviation were extracted using a high / low rejection for each half - magnitude bin .",
    "these data were used to determine the completeness correction curves ( _ cf .  _ figure  [ completeness ] ) by interpolating between the data points with a second order polynomial . from the interpolating function , both a @xmath20 and @xmath21 completeness limits in all four bands were measured .    rather than relying on completeness limits ,",
    "some analysis techniques require precise photometric measurements . in order to satisfy these conditions",
    ", we determined both the @xmath22 and @xmath23 photometric error magnitude limits .",
    "these limits for all four bands were calculated by scanning though the master catalog for all valid detections which had a measured photometric error that was approximately the same as the target photometric error ( @xmath24 magnitudes for @xmath23 photometry and @xmath25 magnitudes for @xmath22 photometry ) .",
    "the means of the magnitudes for all such selected galaxies were determined , and these values were designated as the magnitudes at which the photometric error reached the target error ( _ cf .  _",
    "table  [ limits ] ) .",
    "traditionally , astrometry is performed by identifying calibrated stars within the image of interest .",
    "often these stars are selected from the _",
    "hst  _ guide star catalog ( gsc ) ( @xcite ) . within our stacked image , however , we could not reliably utilize the gsc calibrated stars , since there were not enough unsaturated gsc stars in our final stacked image .",
    "fortunately , we were able to obtain an early release of the _",
    "hst  _ guide star catalog ii ( @xcite ) , which , although it is currently less precise than the original guide star catalog , had sufficient calibration candidates to properly determine an astrometric solution .",
    "the residuals of the final geometric transformation to the gscii for the reference stars were all less than @xmath26 pixels , or equivalently , less than @xmath27 .      to derive an empirical photometric redshift relation , a sample of calibrating",
    "redshifts are required .",
    "two spectroscopic surveys : the canada  france redshift survey ( cfrs ,  @xcite ) , and the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ,  @xcite ) , have both obtained spectroscopic redshifts for objects within our catalog .",
    "the cfrs spectroscopic targets were selected from a complementary ccd imaging survey to @xmath28 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were done using the canada - france - hawaii 3.5 meter telescope .",
    "the deep project is a multi - institution collaboration , in which we are participating , that is currently using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the keck ii 10 meter telescope to obtain spectra for objects to @xmath29 .",
    "deep spectroscopic targets are predominantly selected from images obtained with the repaired _",
    "hst  _ wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "the remaining spectroscopic targets are selected from existing ground based imaging .",
    "the object match - up procedure with each spectroscopic catalog was done using a growing annulus technique where the angular distance @xmath30 was determined using the formula @xmath31 , where the angles ( @xmath32 declination , @xmath33 right ascension ) have been properly converted into radians , and the subscript s refers to spectroscopic target and the subscript p refers to photometric object .",
    "a magnitude restriction was also utilized to prevent improper identifications due to poor relative astrometry , blended objects , or false detections . as both spectroscopic surveys had _",
    "i  _ band magnitudes for the spectroscopic targets , the magnitude test was done using _",
    "i  _ magnitudes .      in an effort to simplify the star  galaxy separation effort",
    ", we measured several different aperture magnitudes in addition to the `` kron '' magnitude we use for the subsequent analysis .",
    "of primary interest is the @xmath34 pixel diameter aperture magnitude ( matched to the median point spread function ) , which provides a measurement of the core flux of an object .",
    "the ratio of the core flux to the total object flux should be larger for the bright stellar objects than for non - stellar objects , as by definition , the majority of the flux of a point source is contained within the point spread function .    in order to determine an empirical algorithm for classifying stellar objects",
    ", we constructed a stellar object catalog from the spectroscopic catalogs , _",
    "hst  _ imaging , and these photometric data .",
    "eighty two objects were selected from the stacked _",
    "i  _ band frame using the iraf task imexam to measure the radial profiles of candidate objects . only those objects with both a gaussian profile and a high signal to noise peak flux were selected .",
    "thirty additional objects were selected from the cfrs spectroscopic data which had a reliable redshift equal to zero , while an additional thirteen spectroscopic stellar objects were selected from the deep data .",
    "finally , we used the _",
    "hst  _ images to identify twenty seven additional sources , providing a total of 152 stellar candidates to quantify the stellar locus .    in addition , all objects which had a total i magnitude brighter than twentieth magnitude were visually inspected and classified as stellar or non - stellar .",
    "we constructed bounding boxes around the classified stellar objects , providing empirical stellar classifications in each band ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ istarclassify ] ) .",
    "the final classification was constructed by taking the union of the four separate classifications , resulting in 505 stellar objects .",
    "the number - magnitude distribution of stellar objects agrees with the predictions of the bahcall - soniera model ( 1980 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the stellar objects is fairly random , with the possible minor exception of the image corners where the psf increases due to focal degradations .",
    "counting the number of galaxies as a function of apparent magnitude is a simple , yet powerful statistic in understanding the evolution of galaxies .",
    "measurements of the number - magnitude relation , however , have typically been hindered in two ways .",
    "first , the amount of sky surveyed was generally sacrificed in an effort to push the completeness limits imaged deeper .",
    "this can produce biases due to object clustering and sample variance .",
    "second , most deep surveys do not fully sample the optical spectral region .",
    "this limits the amount of evolutionary information about the underlying galaxy population that can be reliably extracted .",
    "we , therefore , present the measured number - magnitude counts in the optical bands @xmath14 .",
    "this work is unique for the relatively large area ( @xmath35 sq .",
    "arcminute ) that has been deeply imaged in multiple optical bands . as such",
    ", this dataset serves as a bridge between the large area , shallow photographic surveys , and the small area , deep fields such as the hdf ( @xcite ) .      detecting faint objects in an image",
    "is hindered by many different effects , including object superposition , noise spikes , as well as redshift and evolutionary effects .",
    "furthermore , these complications strongly affect the number - magnitude relation . in order to reliably extend the measured galaxy counts fainter ,",
    "corrections for the completeness of the survey and subsequent analysis must be applied .",
    "invariably , this requires heavy utilization of simulations : either through the simulation of an entire image , or through the addition of simulated images to the actual object frame .",
    "as we wanted to determine the differential number - magnitude relation in a model independent manner , we adopted the latter approach ( _ cf .  _",
    "section  [ cataloglimits ] ) . using the calculated completeness function",
    ", we applied the appropriate scale factor to each galaxy as it was added to the appropriate bin , rather than the entire bin uniformly .",
    "we estimated the errors in our sample by combining the effects of poisson noise with the one @xmath36 completeness errors we derived from our simulations .",
    "we set the absolute lower limit used in our analysis to @xmath37 objects / magnitude / sq .",
    "degree , which corresponds to @xmath38 galaxies detected within a given half - magnitude bin over the entire image , in order to limit the effects of poor statistics .",
    "we measured the slope for the full range using a simple least squares approach . as the corrected counts of the bluer bands indicated a change in the slope parameter ( @xmath39 ) , we also measured the slopes for the bright end ( matching previous photographic surveys ) and for the faint end ( which we can compare to the hdf ) .",
    "modeling the differential number magnitude counts as @xmath40 , we measure a change in the slope ( @xmath41 ) in the @xmath42 band number magnitude relation at @xmath43 previously noted by other authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also measure a change in the @xmath44 band slope ( @xmath45 ) at @xmath46 , which has been suggested earlier ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , our bright slopes agree quite well with the photographic data ( _ cf .  _",
    "table  [ numcounttable ] ) , and although the two normalizations differ , the faint end slope of our ground based data also agrees with our measurements of the slope of the corresponding hdf band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most likely explanation for the difference in the faint end slopes lies in the differences in faint object detection and extraction between the different surveys ( _ cf .  _",
    "the different number of objects detected in the hdf using different techniques  @xcite . )    the measured number magnitude counts are presented in figure  [ ucounts ] for the _",
    "u  _ band , figure  [ bcounts ] for the _ b  _ band , figure  [ rcounts ] for the _ r  _ band , and figure  [ icounts ] for the _ i  _ band . in each of these figures ,",
    "previously published number counts are also displayed .",
    "to understand the evolution of the universe , a large , uniform spectroscopic sample must be utilized .",
    "the creation of such a sample is extremely difficult and currently impractical .",
    "many cosmological tests , however , are more sensitive to the sample size ( _ i.e .  _ poisson noise ) than small errors in distance",
    " which makes them perfect candidates for utilizing a photometric redshift catalog .",
    "we have developed an empirical photometric redshift technique ( @xcite ) , which is not designed to accurately predict the redshift for a given galaxy ( @xcite ) or locate high redshift objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "instead , it is designed to provide distance indicators which are statistically accurate for the entire sample , along with corresponding redshift error estimates .",
    "the accuracy of any empirically derived relationship is predominantly dependent on the quality of the data used in the analysis  photometric redshifts being no exception . as a result",
    ", we imposed several restrictions on the calibrating data in order to minimize the intrinsic dispersion within the photometric redshift relationship .",
    "the calibration data was taken from the spectroscopic cross identification with both the cfrs 14 hour + 52 field and the deep _",
    "hst  _ 5096 field ( _ cf .  _",
    "section  [ spectroxid ] ) .",
    "the cfrs cross identification catalog consisted of 211 objects , while the deep calibrating data provided 188 galaxies , with 28 duplicates between the two .",
    "for all but two duplicate measurements , the mean of the two redshifts was used .",
    "one of the remaining two duplicates ( which had quite discordant redshift measurements ) was eliminated from the sample due to source confusion , while the deep redshift was used for the second ( as it had a higher confidence ) providing 370 spectral cross - identifications .",
    "the next restriction was to select all objects with @xmath47 in order to remove the stellar objects , pruning the catalog to 275 galaxies .",
    "although the intrinsic error of a spectroscopic redshift is generally quoted as @xmath48 , in reality however , a redshift is accurate only when the spectral identification is also accurate . for the cfrs data ,",
    "a redshift quality was generated from both the spectral type and the reliability of the redshift assigned ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cfrs galaxies were then restricted to the following six quality classes : 3 , 4 , 8 , 93 , 94 , 98 , to guarantee that only objects with redshifts having a confidence greater than @xmath49 were retained ; similar , albeit less empirical , constraints were placed on the deep galaxies . the next step was to restrict the sample to those objects which were below the @xmath23 photometric error limit ( _ cf .  _",
    "section  [ cataloglimits ] for more information ) . in the remaining data ,",
    "four objects were found to have bad detection flags ( _ e.g. ,  _ object near edge of frame , incomplete aperture data ) and were subsequently removed , while an additional four galaxies were above our high redshift cut - off of @xmath50 .",
    "the final spectroscopic calibration data consisted of 190 galaxies .",
    "the derivation of photometric redshifts from broadband photometry has been previously shown to be more sensitive to broad spectroscopic continuum features ( primarily the break in the continuum spectra at around 4000  ) rather than specific absorption / emission features ( @xcite ) .",
    "as a result , we define five different redshift intervals ( _ cf .  _",
    "table  [ algorithmz ] ) which track the movement of the 4000   break through our filter system with increasing redshift ( _ cf .  _ figure  [ effectivefilters ] ) . in the three intervals ,",
    "low , medium , and high , we can accurately approximate the galaxy distribution in the four flux space @xmath14  by a second order polynomial . between these selected redshift intervals , however , the continuum break is moving between adjacent filters , introducing a curvature in the galaxy distribution , necessitating the use of a third order polynomial to accurately map the galaxy distribution .",
    "the 190 calibrating redshifts were , therefore , used to derive a global third order polynomial in @xmath14   which provided an initial redshift estimate . likewise , second order polynomials in @xmath14   were determined for the three different redshift intervals , while third order polynomials were determined for the two break regions .",
    "the range of calibrating redshifts for each polynomial fit was extended by approximately 0.05 in order to diminish end - aliasing effects .",
    "this algorithm is designed to generate an optimal redshift for objects by using the more accurate local relations ( @xcite ) . for each derived polynomial fit",
    ", the degrees of freedom remained a substantial fraction of the original data ( a second order fit in four variables requires 15 parameters while a third order fit in four variables requires 35 parameters ) .",
    "the relative importance of the different bands in the individual redshift intervals reflects the curvature inherent within the distribution of galaxies in the four dimensional flux space . in a given redshift range",
    ", the curvature can be accurately approximated by a second order polynomial .",
    "between redshift intervals , however , the distribution displays a higher order curvature term ( _ cf .",
    "_ the previous discussion concerning the continuum break ) , which requires the higher order fit .",
    "the correlation between the four band photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is shown in figure  [ fullphotoz ] . the intrinsic dispersion ( @xmath51 )",
    "is relatively stable throughout the redshift range spanned by the calibrating galaxies , and as shown in figure  [ fullzhistogram ] , is clearly gaussian in projection .",
    "the overall accuracy with which we can estimate redshifts leads us to two related conclusions .",
    "first , this technique is extremely dependent at these redshifts on the break over the redshift interval sampled by the calibration data , which is present in nearly all galaxies .",
    "second , metallicity , dust , and age variations have similar effects in this multidimensional space , albeit almost orthogonal to the redshift vector ( @xcite ) , and therefore affect the galaxy distribution , which we are attempting to model , in similar directions .      in a similar manner , we calculated photometric redshift relations for the four different fixed aperture magnitudes in our catalog ( 2.5 pixels , 5 pixels , 10 pixels and 20 pixels ) .",
    "we compare their intrinsic dispersions in figure  [ aperturez ] . due to the strength of the 4000   continuum feature in determining the photometric redshift of an object",
    ", we decided to test the hypothesis that `` bulge '' magnitudes would produce a more accurate photometric redshift relationship . in no case did a fixed aperture magnitude reduce the dispersion over a total magnitude .",
    "the results , however , are encouraging , and worth a deeper examination .",
    "the two best relations are clearly the 5 and 10 pixel aperture magnitudes . in the @xmath52 band ,",
    "the median full width at half maximum for all objects with @xmath53 is approximately 4.7 pixels .",
    "thus , the 5 pixel aperture generally accounts for approximately @xmath54 of the object , while the 10 pixel aperture accounts for approximately @xmath55 of the typical object . as the aperture size",
    "is decreased , the effects of shot noise will become significant ( since we are sampling only the core of an object ) .",
    "on the other hand , as the aperture size is increased , sky noise will begin to affect the relationship more strongly ( since we are sampling the wings of the object flux distribution ) .",
    "therefore , the total magnitudes that we use in our analysis are best approximated by the 10 pixel fixed aperture magnitudes , which sample the majority of an objects flux .",
    "due to the effects of ground based seeing , however , we can not reliably estimate a bulge magnitude due to the faint nature of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "this approach , however , might prove more useful for space - based data ( _ i.e .",
    "_ _ hst  _ ) .",
    "a subtle , and often overlooked , effect in any photometric redshift analysis is the requirement for accurate multi - band photometry .",
    "ideally we could restrict our photometric - redshift catalog to only those objects which have measured magnitude errors below some set limits ( _ e.g. ,  _ @xmath23 photometry ) .",
    "this type of a restriction , however , introduces two complications : a bias towards blue spectral types , and a subsequently complicated selection effect ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ bandseleffect ] ) .    in an attempt to overcome these biases , we restrict the full sample to those objects which have both @xmath56 and measured magnitude errors @xmath57 in @xmath58 .",
    "this minimizes any selection bias to only faint early - type galaxies . in figure",
    "[ ibandcut ] , the effects of this cut can be discerned , and from the bottom panel ( which models our final selection criteria ) , it is fairly evident that this particular selection results in a sample that is _ i  _ band limited with a high redshift cut from the lyman break systems ( _ i.e .  _",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 band drop - outs ) .",
    "the remaining filter combinations contribute to the noise in our analysis ( _ i.e .",
    "_ when we consider our final catalog complete to @xmath61 ) , and amount to only a few percent when combined .",
    "the final catalog contains 3612 sources , of which 442 are classified as stellar objects , and a remaining 118 sources had bad detection flags ( _ e.g. ,  _ edge of frame , incomplete aperture data ) .",
    "our final photometric - redshift catalog , therefore , contains 3052 sources .        by directly comparing the estimated photometric ",
    "redshift with the measured spectroscopic redshift , we can estimate the precision with which we have quantified the topology of the galaxy distribution in the four band flux space @xmath14 . when estimating redshifts for objects with no spectroscopic redshifts ( which is the goal of this analysis ) what is desired is an independent estimate of the error in the photometric redshift .    in order to determine the optimal error estimate for galaxies with no spectroscopic redshift",
    ", we developed a bootstrap error estimation techniques that would generate multiple realizations of the photometric redshift relation from which we could test various error estimators .",
    "the fundamental principles behind this technique are to model the effects of removing calibrating galaxies from the sample , while simultaneously including the effects of the photometric errors .",
    "this will simulate the possible effects of an incomplete sampling of the distribution in flux space by the calibrating galaxies .",
    "algorithmically , the calibration sample is randomly divided into two samples , new calibration data , and test data .",
    "although random , the division is devised so that the calibrating sample is divided into 15 bins , with 14 of the bins ( @xmath62 galaxies ) used to calibrate the relationship , and the remaining bin ( @xmath63 galaxies ) used to test the new relationship .",
    "this algorithm was implemented in mathematica ( @xcite ) , and 1000 iterations were produced . if the division process was truly random , each galaxy would have a probability of being selected of @xmath64 for each iteration , and , therefore , in 1000 iterations , each galaxy should be selected on average 67 times .",
    "the actual statistics compare quite well , as the mean of the selection distribution was @xmath65 , the standard deviation was @xmath66 , while the minimum number of times a galaxy was selected was 43 and the maximum number was 185 .    every time a galaxy was a member of the test sample , its estimated redshift was appended to the list of estimated redshifts for that galaxy . after the completion of the 1000 iterations , the following quantities were calculated for every calibration object from the list of estimated redshifts : the mean of the estimated redshifts ,",
    "the trimmed ( one sigma deviations from the actual mean ) mean , the standard deviation of the estimated redshifts , and the six quantiles ( uniformly spaced in @xmath36 ) at the values : 0.0228 ( @xmath67 ) , 0.1587 ( @xmath68 ) , 0.3085 ( @xmath69 ) , 0.6915 ( @xmath70 ) , 0.8413 ( @xmath71 ) , 0.9772 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the six quantiles and the standard deviation of the distribution can be used to define four independent error estimators .",
    "the advantage of using the quantiles to estimate the standard deviation of a distribution is that they are much less sensitive to extreme outliers .",
    "since the derivation of the photometric redshift relationship is more dependent on certain calibrating redshifts ( due to the the incomplete sampling of the topology of the galaxy distribution in the four dimensional flux space @xmath14  by the calibrating galaxies ) , the quantile error estimators are , on average , more precise estimates of the redshift error than the standard deviation of the distribution .",
    "after a lengthy comparison , we defined the error of a photometric redshift to be @xmath73 .",
    "this was due in part to its tighter correlation with @xmath74 than both the standard deviation and the @xmath75 error estimator , and also because the @xmath76 error estimator samples a larger number of data points than the @xmath77 error estimator due to its larger width ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ sigzz ] ) .    a comparison between the defined error estimator and the four different magnitudes ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ sigzm ] ) demonstrates the sensitivity of the empirical fitting procedure on the calibration sample . at both limits ,",
    "the distribution of galaxies is not fully sampled , and as a result , the estimated error is consequently larger .",
    "the estimated error distribution is also affected by the increase in photometric error at fainter magnitudes .      to estimate the error in a photometric redshift for the full photometric sample , we adopt a similar error estimation technique .",
    "different realizations of the photometric redshift relationship are determined by adopting a bootstrap with replacement algorithm , in which galaxies are randomly selected from the calibration sample and , once selected , are not removed from the set of calibrating galaxies .",
    "thus , at the extremes , one galaxy could be selected 190 consecutive times or , alternatively , each redshift could be selected exactly once ( each of these realizations has the same probability ) .",
    "this approach is designed to emphasize any incompleteness in the sampling of the true distribution of galaxies in the four dimensional space @xmath14   by the calibration redshifts .",
    "as before , with each different realization , the magnitudes of the calibrating sample were drawn from a gaussian probability distribution function with mean given by the measured magnitude and sigma by the magnitude error .",
    "this algorithm was implemented in mathematica , and 100 different realizations of the photometric redshift relationship were derived . for each different realization ,",
    "a photometric redshift was calculated for every galaxy in the photometric redshift catalog .",
    "the six quantiles at the values : 0.0228 ( @xmath67 ) , 0.1587 ( @xmath68 ) , 0.3085 ( @xmath69 ) , 0.6915 ( @xmath70 ) , 0.8413 ( @xmath71 ) , 0.9772 ( @xmath72 ) , were computed from the 100 different redshift estimates for each object . the error in the photometric redshift for each object was defined , as before , by @xmath78 .",
    "the photometric redshift and corresponding error are compared in figure  [ fullsigmaz ] . as expected",
    "the average estimated error is the largest at the upper and lower redshift limits where the incompleteness in the calibrating sample is most evident .",
    "the majority of the rest of the objects with extremely large redshift errors are blended in one or more bands ( there are 361 objects with @xmath79 and @xmath80 of them are blended or contaminated by nearby objects ) . as a result , objects which are affected by neighboring objects are isolated from the high density surface delineated by the majority of galaxies in the four flux space @xmath14 . the affect these objects",
    "impart on any subsequent analysis , however , is minimized by the inclusion of their photometric error , which causes them to be non - localized in redshift space . as a result , these objects provide a minimal contribution to many `` redshift bins '' rather than strongly biasing only a few bins .",
    "on the other hand , those objects which are not blended , and still have large estimated redshift errors could define an extremely interesting sample for spectroscopic study ( _ i.e .  _",
    "qso s or active galaxies ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that by their very nature , these types of objects are unlike the majority of galaxies in the universe .",
    "in addition to having an estimate for the redshift for each galaxy , evolutionary trends can be discussed in terms of the different types of observed galaxies present within the universe . for low redshifts ,",
    "galaxies are often segregated based upon their morphology ( _ i.e .  _ the hubble sequence ) . at moderate to higher redshifts , however , morphological typing is extremely difficult , especially for ground based imaging . as a result",
    ", we adopt a different approach , which classifies galaxies by the spectral type which best matches their observed magnitudes .",
    "the calculation of synthetic magnitudes from spectral energy distributions ( seds ) is based on the definition of apparent magnitudes .",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 is the absolute spectral energy distribution of the object in units of erg @xmath83 s@xmath84 @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the system response function for filter @xmath86_u  _ , _ b  _ , _ r  _ , _ i  _ @xmath87 which we take as the convolution of the ccd quantum efficiency and the appropriate filter response function . @xmath88 is the zeropoint for the system , which is generally derived for @xmath89 ( vega ) .",
    "we transformed our calculated synthetic magnitudes to the ab system ( @xcite ) which introduces a zeropoint shift @xmath90 given by computing the synthetic ab magnitudes for @xmath89 in each filter ( @xcite ) : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "we , therefore , calculated magnitudes in a filter @xmath95 given a spectral energy distribution , @xmath96 where the zeropoints are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .      in order to match the full range of observed magnitudes in the photometric redshift catalog , we required template spectra which extend to @xmath101 @xmath102  , where @xmath103   is the approximate blue cut - off for the _",
    "u  _ filter . rather than generating model template spectra to classify galaxies",
    ", we selected the coleman , wu , and weedman ( 1980 ) uv - optical template spectra constructed from real galaxy spectra .",
    "the sample includes irregular , scd , sbc , and elliptical spectral energy distributions .",
    "the four template spectra are compared in figure  [ spectranorm ] in which the spectra smoothed over @xmath104 , and normalized to the elliptical flux at @xmath105 .",
    "synthetic ab magnitudes for the four template spectra were calculated for redshifts from @xmath106 to @xmath50 in steps of @xmath107 .",
    "this involves both redshifting each template spectra so that @xmath108 , and reducing the flux by a factor of @xmath109 .      to determine a spectral classification for each object",
    ", we need to optimally select a spectral energy distribution from the grid of redshifted template spectra .",
    "algorithmically , we need to select the best fit to our data for different models , which is most easily done using chi - square fitting ( @xcite ) . the optimal spectral energy distribution will , therefore , minimize the chi - squared statistic : @xmath110 where @xmath86_u  _ , _ b  _ , _ r  _ , _",
    "i  _ @xmath87 , @xmath111 is the flux for the target object in the @xmath95 filter , and @xmath112 is the flux for the current template spectra in the @xmath95 filter .",
    "the constant @xmath113 is determined by minimizing the variation of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath113 , which gives : @xmath114    this classification technique is essentially an inverted template sed photometric redshift calculation .",
    "the quantities @xmath113 , and @xmath115 are computed for each of the redshift - selected template spectra from the object s observed broadband ab magnitudes and magnitude errors ( _ i.e .",
    "_ to include the effects of photometric errors ) .",
    "this process was extended to include the estimated redshift errors , by selecting the redshift of a particular object from a gaussian probability distribution function with mean and sigma given by the object s estimated redshift and redshift error .",
    "this was performed one hundred times for each object , resulting in one hundred different spectral classifications .",
    "the particular template which had the smallest @xmath18 was then selected as the optimal sed for that object .",
    "the different percentages of each spectral type are compared in figure  [ sedpercentage ] .",
    "clearly the bluer spectra dominate the classification .",
    "this should not be interpreted as evidence for an overwhelming dominance of ultra luminous galaxies in this sample , particularly in light of our bias against early type galaxies . instead",
    ", the best interpretation is that from the four template spectra originally selected for this analysis , the redshifted seds of nearby starbursting galaxies best match the observed data .",
    "in fact , this result demonstrates that galaxies tend to become bluer with redshift ( _ i.e .  _ the faint blue galaxy problem ) .",
    "other examples of this are seen in the cfrs luminosity functions ( @xcite ) and the hdf morphological number counts ( @xcite ) .    to form an impression of the accuracy of this spectral classification , each template",
    "was compared to the objects which were assigned to that template in two different colors : @xmath116 ( figure  [ tui ] ) , which presents the largest spectral baseline ; and @xmath117 ( figure  [ tbi ] ) , which is an interpolated @xmath118 band magnitude .",
    "for all four templates , the data clearly agree quite well , indicating that the classification algorithm is working properly .",
    "we can derive the number of galaxies as a function of redshift , @xmath119 , as an example of a statistical application of photometric redshifts .",
    "first , we computed the number redshift distribution ( in the traditional fashion ) for redshift bins of width 0.1 magnitude .",
    "the resulting histogram is compared with the measured number - redshift distribution for the combined deep and cfrs samples in figure  [ nofz ] . since photometric redshifts are not equivalent to spectroscopic redshifts , this is clearly not the optimal method .",
    "an analytic method for estimating the number redshift distribution using photometric redshifts can be used to provide a more realistic redshift distribution .",
    "we define the probability density function , @xmath120 , for an individual galaxy s redshift to be a gaussian probability distribution function with mean ( @xmath121 ) given by the estimated photometric redshift and standard deviation ( @xmath36 ) defined by the estimated error in the photometric redshift .",
    "@xmath122    when constructing the number redshift distribution , the cumulative distribution function for each galaxy is calculated over each redshift bin .",
    "this requires numerically integrating the probability density function , which is given by the error function , @xmath123 , for each galaxy between the endpoints of each redshift bin .    a formal , analytic technique , however , is not always available to utilize photometric redshifts and their associated errors when measuring cosmologically interesting quantities . as a result",
    ", we have developed an alternative technique , the galaxy ensemble approach .",
    "essentially , we treat the problem in the context of statistical mechanics , where each galaxy is localized in redshift space by a gaussian probability distribution function . to calculate a physically meaningful quantity ,",
    "we create multiple realizations ( or ensembles ) of the galaxy redshift distribution , and calculate the appropriate quantity for all of the different ensembles .",
    "we then average the different measurements to produce the desired value , simultaneously producing a realistic error estimate .    to demonstrate the viability of this technique , we calculated the number redshift distribution as a function of spectral type , both analytically and using the ensemble approach . from figure  [ nofztypes ] ,",
    "the two distributions show remarkable agreement , both with each other as well as the spectroscopic number redshift distribution , with the benefit of the ensemble error estimate demonstrated ( _ i.e .",
    "_ error bars ) .",
    "the differences in the redshift distributions of the different spectral types , which were computed as outlined in section  [ nofzapp ] , such as the selection bias against elliptical galaxies , are also visible .",

    "we also presented the photometric data which we have used to develop this technique . using the number magnitude test ,",
    "we have verified the validity of our catalog , and demonstrated the turnover in the @xmath59 and @xmath60 band number counts previously discussed .",
