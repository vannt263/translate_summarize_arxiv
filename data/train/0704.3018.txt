    "in  @xcite , r. hamilton introduces ricci flow which deforms riemannian metrics in the direction of the ricci tensor .",

    "one can even understand geometric and topological structure of the underlying differential manifold by this sort of deformation .",
    "the idea is best illustrated in  @xcite where hamilton proves that in any simply connected 3 manifold without boundary , any riemannian metric with positive ricci curvature can be deformed into a positive space form ( up to scaling ) .",
    "consequently , r. hamilton proves that the underlying manifold is indeed diffeomorphic to @xmath5 this fundamental work sparks a great interest of many mathematicians in ricci flow . in a series of work , r. hamilton introduces an ambitious program to prove the poincar conjecture via ricci flow ( cf .",
