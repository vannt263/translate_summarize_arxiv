    "when ultra - cold neutrons ( ucns ) are trapped in the earth s gravitational field , their energy is quantized . in consequence ,",
    "their probability density distribution exhibits their vertical modulation .",
    "the scale of this density modulation is calculated to be @xmath4 .",
    "observations of such quantum states have been presented in refs .",
    "we have proposed a more precise measurement using a pixel detector with an image magnification system @xcite .",
    "another pixel detectors for ucn have been developed recently , such as that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this article",
    "we present the development of a pixel detector based on a commercial charge coupled device ( ccd ) covered with a neutron converter . by comparing @xmath0 and @xmath1 as converter materials , we find that a @xmath1 converter produces energetic tritons which penetrate deep into the ccd in various directions , degrading the spatial resolution . hence we conclude that @xmath0 is an appropriate material for a neutron converter .",
    "the developed detector consists essentially of a ccd covered by a neutron converter .",
    "charged particles produced via nuclear reaction in the converter are detected with the ccd .",
    "the choices of converter material and ccd are key for this detector .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are chosen as test materials for the neutron converter , because of their large cross - sections with neutrons .",
    "the neutron absorption cross - sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 barn , respectively , for thermal neutrons ( @xmath7 = 2,224 m / s ) .",
    "neutrons react with @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the following processes : @xmath8    @xmath0 has advantages over @xmath1 in that it has a larger cross section and a shorter range for converted charged particles in the ccd ; @xmath0 emits only short range particles .",
    "the ranges of @xmath9(1.47 mev ) , @xmath9(1.78 mev ) and @xmath10(0.84 mev , 1.01 mev ) in si are 5 , 6 and 2 @xmath11 m , respectively .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1 emits @xmath9 particles and tritons with ranges of 7 and 40 @xmath11 m .",
    "long range tritons degrade the spatial resolution , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a ccd is an ideal device for ucn detection because of its high spatial resolution and its ability to capture data in real time .",
    "since a ccd can not directly detect neutral particles , a neutron converter to create charged particles must be attached to the front of the device .",
    "a back - thinned type ccd is chosen to avoid a large insensitive volume in front of the active volume of the ccd , which would prevent converted charged particles entering the active volume or degrade the spatial resolution .",
    "we use a commercial ccd detector , hamamatsu s7170 - 0909 , in the low dark current read out mode .",
    "the specifications are shown in table [ ccd : spec ] .",
    "generally , ccd might have white - spot pixels induced by radiation damage .",
    "only 2 pixels have become noisy after 60 million neutron irradiation per 512@xmath12512 pixels during the neutron beam tests mentioned below .",

    "c ) [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the reference pattern used in the above test does not have perfectly straight edges , probably because the gadolinium foil is too thick to form sharp edges .",
    "the variations from a straight slit edge are observed to be 12 @xmath3 by optical microscopy .",
    "the spatial resolution evaluated using the reference pattern ( table [ different_resolution ] ) includes this effect @xcite .    to evaluate the intrinsic spatial resolution in our detector , we fabricated a more precise reference pattern at the center for integrated nano technology support of tohoku university .",
    "[ gd_pattern ] shows the layout of the reference gd pattern .",
    "the pattern consists of stripes that have different widths of 140 @xmath3 .",
    "the pattern is fabricated by a damascene process , usually used for semiconductor devices @xcite .",
    "the damascene process is shown in fig .",
    "[ damascene ]    this process produces an edge to the pattern that is sufficiently sharp .",
    "the thickness of the gadolinium is 25 @xmath3 , which corresponds to an absorption probability of 7597% for cns .",
    "[ 5um_trench ] shows the 5 @xmath11m - wide trench after polishing .    using this striped pattern ,",
    "the differences in the spatial resolution with respect to the read out directions are measured .",
    "[ scatterhv ] shows the hit position distribution measured with the pattern , and fig .",
    "[ resolution ] shows the their projections onto the horizontal and vertical direction .",
    "the spatial resolution is evaluated by fitting .",
    "the fitting function is expressed by the sum of an error function and a complementary error function : @xmath14 + p_3,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the hit position , @xmath16 is the spatial resolution , @xmath17 is the distance from the initial position of the pattern to the @xmath18 stripe , @xmath19 is the width of the @xmath18 stripe and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are free fitting parameters .",
    "the 12 widest stripes , whose widths are 540 @xmath3 , are used for this fitting .",
    "this is because gadolinium can not enter trenches narrower than @xmath23 in the spattering process .    in the fitting result ,",
    "the horizontal and vertical resolutions are evaluated to be 2.9@xmath20.1 @xmath3 and 4.3@xmath20.2 @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to 6.9@xmath20.2 @xmath3 and 9.9@xmath20.3 @xmath3 of the full width at half maximum of the line spread functions .",
    "this difference is caused by the difference in the full well capacity .",
    "the measured spatial resolution is much finer than the pixel size of 24 @xmath3 .",
    "we developed a pixel detector for ucn which has high spatial resolution with temporal information .",
    "the detector is based on a commercial ccd on which a suitable neutron converter is directly evaporated . @xmath0 and @xmath24 are tested as neutron converter materials .",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 has better properties as a neutron converter material . using @xmath0 ,",
    "the ucn detection efficiency is 44.1@xmath21.1% .",
    "our ucn detector can measure the ucn incident position with a precision of 2.9@xmath20.1 @xmath3 ( horizontal ) and 4.3@xmath20.2 @xmath3 ( vertical ) in terms of sigma of the error functions .",
