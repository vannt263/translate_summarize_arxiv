    "while the internal structure of the proton has received enormous attention over the past decades , the structure of its isospin partner , the neutron , has not been studied as intensively .",
    "the response of the neutron to electromagnetic probes is not only of interest to characterize the structure of the nucleon , but is also of considerable practical application , in particular when the neutron is embedded in a nucleus .",
    "the application that motivated the present study is the need to understand the cross sections for electron scattering from @xmath1n in experiments using ammonia ( @xmath1nh@xmath9 or @xmath1nd@xmath9 ) as a source of polarized protons or deuterons . in experiments using polarized ammonia to measure the spin structure functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , data are also taken using a carbon target , so that in practice the `` dilution '' from unpolarized materials ( i.e. relative ratio of counts from @xmath1n ) can be determined from good fits to the ratios @xmath1n/@xmath2c and measured ratios of carbon to proton or deuteron cross sections .",
    "polarized ammonia targets are normally immersed in a bath of liquid he , so it is also important to study @xmath7he/@xmath2c .",
    "another area where precision knowledge of the differences in proton and neutron structure is of increasing practical importance is in the field of neutrino scattering .",
    "the targets in these low - rate experiments are normally made of heavy materials such as iron to maximize count rates .",
    "the structure of the neutron in iron has already been shown to be important to the interpretation of the nutev experiment  @xcite .",
    "precision knowledge of lepton - nucleon scattering from nuclei will be of particular importance to the interpretation of planned neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .    a considerable body of data  @xcite for inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering from nuclei exists for a variety of nuclei in the deep - inelastic ( dis ) region ( missing mass @xmath12 gev , 4-momentum transfer @xmath13 gev@xmath5 ) , where one expects the @xmath14 ratio in a nucleus to be very similar to that determined from @xmath15 ratios . for @xmath16 gev , the effects of prominent nucleon resonances , nucleon fermi motion , meson exchange currents ( mec ) and final state interactions ( fsi ) in larger nuclei are of greater magnitude than in the case of deuterium , so one can no longer simply use @xmath15 ratios to account for the neutron excess in nuclei such as @xmath1n , or fe",
    ". comparisons of nuclei with similar atomic number , but differing ratios of neutrons to protons , are relatively scant in the nucleon resonance region  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1n/@xmath2c over a wide range of @xmath0 in the nucleon resonance region from the present experiment were designed to help address this situation .",
    "an interesting by - product is a large body of high - statistical precision ratios of @xmath7he/@xmath2c with a common systematic error .",
    "the present results were obtained as part of the eg1b experiment  @xcite at jefferson lab , conducted in 2001 .",
    "the bulk of the experiment used polarized ammonia targets  @xcite to study electron scattering from polarized hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "the ammonia content was dominated by @xmath1n and was bathed in liquid he . therefore we measured scattering from solid @xmath1n , carbon and empty targets , all bathed in liquid he , in order to understand and account for the unpolarized `` dilution factor '' .",
    "this article reports on the results obtained with a 2.285 gev electron beam for the nitrogen to carbon ratios , and beam energies of 1.603 , 1.721 and 2.285 gev for the empty to carbon target ratios .",
    "electrons scattered at angles between 10 and 45 degrees were detected in clas  @xcite .",
    "experimental targets for @xmath1n and @xmath2c data consisted of frozen @xmath1n material inside a thin ( @xmath171.7 cm ) target cup and an amorphous carbon slab , respectively . both were immersed in an approximately 1.7-cm - long , 1 k lhe bath between two thin aluminum and kapton windows .",
    "the vertex tracking resolution was not sufficiently precise to distinguish between events scattering from the windows , the lhe bath , or the central nitrogen and carbon targets .",
    "a third target ( mt ) contained only lhe and the thin windows .",
    "the mass thicknesses of all target materials are listed in table [ materials : table ] . for modeling purposes",
    ", kapton is approximated as equivalent to @xmath2c . while the thickness of the carbon slab was relatively well known ,",
    "the thickness of lhe and nitrogen were relatively poorly determined , due to the difficulties of working with targets at 1 k.    .mass thickness @xmath18 and percentage of radiation length ( r.l . )",
    "@xmath19 of materials in each of the targets used in this experiment . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     scattered electrons were principally identified ( and distinguished from pions ) by a cherenkov threshold detector and electromagnetic shower calorimeter .",
    "their momenta were determined by drift chambers and time - of - flight tracking in a ( superconducting torus ) magnetic field , with a trigger threshold of 0.3 gev .",
    "kinematically complete elastic @xmath20 and inelastic @xmath21 events from separate nh@xmath9 scattering data were used for calibration of the momentum scale  @xcite .",
    "additional details on the beam , detectors , calibrations , and data analysis can be found in ref .",
    ".    ratios of count rates , normalized to total ( live - time gated ) incident electron charge , were calculated for the nitrogen and carbon target scattering events , and binned in @xmath6 and final state invariant mass @xmath22 .",
    "all @xmath1n/@xmath2c ratios were for a beam energy of 2.285 gev .",
    "similar ratios were also calculated between the carbon and empty targets , for the determination of the @xmath2c/@xmath7he cross - section ratios . in this case , the ratios at each of three beam energies , 1.603 , 1.721 and 2.285 gev , were taken individually , and the results then averaged .",
    "a @xmath23 test showed the three sets of ratios to be statistically compatible .",
    "small corrections were made for pions mis - identified as electrons , and for electrons from pair - symmetric decays of @xmath24 mesons ( measured by reversing the clas torus polarity ) .",
    "systematic errors in the cross section ratios from these corrections are generally very small , with a maximum of 0.5% at the highest @xmath22 .    radiated cross - section models accounting for the mass and radiation length thicknesses of all materials within the targets were then fit to the count ratio measurements .",
    "the two fit parameters were the thickness of the nitrogen target and the length of the lhe .",
    "internal and external radiative effects were accounted for using the formalism of mo and tsai  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of radiative effects required modeling of nuclear elastic , quasi - elastic , and inelastic cross sections from all nuclei in the targets .",
    "the calculations used the nuclear charge radii of ref .",
    "@xcite for the elastic form factors ( evaluated in the shell model ) , and the super - scaling model of ref .",

    "@xcite and the @xmath25-scaling function of ref .",
    "@xcite for both the longitudinal and transverse cross sections .",
    "the donnelly model  @xcite has two parameters ( loosely related to fermi broadening and average binding energy ) that differ from nucleus to nucleus : we used @xmath26 gev for @xmath7he and @xmath27 gev for carbon and nitrogen . a pauli - suppression correction at low @xmath6 used the prescription of mo and tsai  @xcite .",
    "inelastic scattering was modeled using a fermi - convolution method of `` smearing '' free proton  @xcite and neutron  @xcite cross sections .",
    "the smearing was done in a manner similar to that described for the deuteron in ref .",
    "a detailed description , with the numerous formulas and parameters involved , is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "however , fortran computer code for both the quasi - elastic and inelastic models used in this paper is available  @xcite .",
    "systematic errors were determined by making reasonable variations in the cross section models and target parameters .",
    "the contributions from the lhe in the carbon and nitrogen targets were subtracted using the radiated cross section global fit , as were the contributions from the aluminum and kapton windows in all three targets .",
    "born - level ratios were then determined from the background - subtracted ratios , using the calculated ratio of born and radiated cross sections for each target material .",
    "the beam - energy averaged ratios of born - level cross sections for @xmath7he/@xmath2c are shown as the solid circles in fig .  [",
    "fig : he ] .",
    "numerical results are available in the clas data base  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the results are generally in good agreement with @xmath0 dependence of the ratios from the born - level inelastic cross section model that we used for radiative corrections and background subtractions ( solid curves ) .",
    "this validates the use of this model in correcting for the lhe contributions to the carbon and nitrogen targets . at moderate @xmath6 ,",
    "the present ratios are reasonably consistent with previous data taken at a scattering angle of 37 degrees and beam energies of 0.9 to 1.2 gev at slac  @xcite ( open circles ) .",
    "the high statistical precision of the present data is useful for constraining future fits to the kinematic dependence of helium and carbon cross sections . in particular , the widths of the peaks near @xmath8 gev ( from quasi - elastic scattering ) and @xmath29 gev ( from excitation of the @xmath30 resonance ) , are very sensitive to the difference in average fermi motion between helium and carbon ( we used 180 mev and 225 mev , respectively , for the fermi smearing parameter @xmath31 in our model ) .",
    "the depth of the dip between these two peaks is sensitive to possible differences in mec and fsi ( we assumed no difference in our model ) .",
    "a slight peak in the ratios near @xmath32 gev is also evident in both the data and model at lower values of @xmath6 .",
    "the ratios of extracted born cross sections per nucleon for @xmath1n/@xmath2c are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : b ] as a function of invariant mass @xmath22 for nine bins in @xmath6 and a beam energy of 2.285  gev .",
    "point - to - point systematic errors ( included in the outer error bars ) are relatively small . due to the uncertainties in the target material thicknesses",
    ", there is an overall normalization error of 6% .",
    "numerical results are available in the clas data base  @xcite .",
    "in general , there is good agreement with the cross section model ratios used for radiative and background corrections , shown as the solid curves .",
    "the pronounced dips in the ratios near the quasi - elastic region ( w=0.94 gev ) `` level off '' with increasing @xmath6 , due to the increasing contributions from inelastic scattering , and the increasing ratio of neutron to proton elastic form factors .",
    "the ratios in the resonance region ( @xmath33 gev ) show only slight resonant structure . at lower @xmath6 , both data and the model show enhanced ratios near the @xmath30 peak , where the neutron to proton ratio is expected to approach unity due to the isovector nature of this resonance , while the non - resonant background has a smaller ratio  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement near @xmath29 gev in the model is not due to a difference in fermi motion , because the same average fermi momentum was assumed in the model for carbon and nitrogen .",
    "a slight dip near the @xmath34 resonance is possibly evident . at higher @xmath6 ,",
    "fermi - smearing effects become more significant , and all indications of resonant structure disappear .    on average ,",
    "the ratios tend to decrease with increasing @xmath6 at fixed @xmath22 , corresponding to larger values of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath35 . in deep - inelastic scattering , @xmath36",
    "is approximately given by @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "to approximately take into account target - mass effects , @xmath35 was replaced with the nachtmann  @xcite scaling variable @xmath38 .",
    "the dashed curve generated defined by @xmath39n@xmath40c)@xmath41 using @xmath42 , shown in fig .  [ fig : b ] , is a remarkably good approximation of the data , especially at the low @xmath6 values of this experiment , where additional higher twist effects might be expected to play a role .",
    "this is particularly true if one averages over the quasi - elastic and @xmath43 resonance regions  @xcite ; in which case the resultant curve matches the nachtmann - scaled extrapolation into the dis region .",
    "this appears to perhaps be yet another manifestation of quark - hadron duality , the fulfillment of which implies the marked absence or cancellation of higher - twist effects @xcite . that these higher twist , multi - parton contributions appear to cancel nearly completely in the ratio is a noteworthy , if not unexpected phenomenon at these values of @xmath6 .",
    "we find that the @xmath0-dependence of ratios of electroproduction cross sections for @xmath1n/@xmath2c and @xmath28he/@xmath2c can be remarkably well - described by a simple model based on super - scaling in the quasi - elastic region , and simple fermi - smearing in the nucleon resonance region , even at @xmath6 values as low as 0.1 gev@xmath5 .",
    "large oscillations in the ratios of @xmath28he/@xmath2c peaked near @xmath8 , 1.23 , and 1.5 gev can be attributed to a difference in average fermi momentum .",
    "in contrast , little structure is seen in the ratios of @xmath1n/@xmath2c , except for small effects in the @xmath30 region and a decrease in the quasi - elastic region expected from the ratio of neutron to proton form factors .",
    "the new data can be used to refine more detailed microscopic models of lepton - nucleon scattering in the nuclear medium .    suitably averaged over @xmath22 ( as for example as may occur naturally with the use of a wide - band neutrino beam ) , the ratios of @xmath1n/@xmath2c and @xmath28he/@xmath2c bear a strong resemblance to extrapolations of dis models into the nucleon resonance region .",
    "this observation might be used to simplify predictions for neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it is also another indication of the applicability of the concepts of quark - hadron duality down to remarkably low values of @xmath6 .",
