    "a new class of double perovskites @xmath10cu@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath10cfo ) has attracted extensive attention in the recent years , as they exhibit unusual valence transitions , which have significant impact on their electrical and magnetic properties .",
    "such valence transitions can be induced by a small external stimulus rather than by carrier doping .",
    "a prototypical example is the observed charge disproportionation between fe atoms ( 2fe@xmath11 fe@xmath12 + fe@xmath13 ) in cacfo  @xcite , accompanied with paramagnetic - ferrimagnetic and metal - insulator phase transitions .",
    "the substitution of sr for ca turns the observed ferrimagnetic state in cacfo into an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , srcfo exhibits a giant negative thermal expansion , ascribed to a temperature - induced intersite charge transfer from fe to cu .",
    "intriguingly , the size of @xmath14 ion is the only relevant parameter , determining the type of the magnetic and valence transitions in these systems .",
    "+ recently , very similar behaviors have also been observed in rather different @xmath10cfo systems with @xmath15 ions such as la  @xcite , bi  @xcite and y  @xcite .",
    "lacfo and bicfo exhibit a temperature - induced intermetallic charge transfer ( 3cu@xmath12 + 4fe@xmath16 3cu@xmath17 + 4fe@xmath18 ) , giving rise to an insulator - metal transition as well as an abrupt volume reduction .",
    "such a sharp discontinuity in resistivity , susceptibility , and volume implies a first - order phase transition in these systems .",
    "interestingly , long @xmath19  @xcite have recently discovered that applying pressure can also cause an intersite charge transfer in lacfo . on the other hand , ycfo exhibits charge disproportionation ( 8fe@xmath205fe@xmath12 + 3fe@xmath13 ) rather than intersite charge transfer .",
    "+ to understand the mechanism behind these phase transitions , yamada @xmath19  @xcite recently synthesized a number of @xmath0cfo perovskites ( @xmath0 = lanthanides : la , pr , nd , sm , eu , gd , tb , dy , ho , er , tm , yb , lu ) , and systematically studied their electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "they found that the compounds with light rare earth elements ( lree ) exhibit intersite charge transfer with a temperature - induced paramagnetic - antiferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "the corresponding transition temperature was found to be higher for compounds with larger lree .",
    "in contrast , the compounds containing the heavy rare earth elements ( hree ) exhibited a charge disproportionation leading to a metal - semiconductor phase transition .",
    "remarkably , the transition temperature in these systems was found to be rather insensitive to the size of @xmath0 .",
    "this study has accordingly raised the question how and why the size of @xmath0 determines the type of the valence transition .",
    "+ for lacfo , it has been experimentally shown that the energy scale of the exchange coupling in the low temperature phase is much larger than the transition temperature of the valence transition .",
    "this observation suggests that the magnetic long - range order can not be the driving force for charge transfer  @xcite . on the theory side",
    ", li _ et al . _ performed a spin - density - functional calculation for lacfo  @xcite and proposed a scenario in which the o-@xmath21 orbitals mediate the cu - fe intermetallic charge transfer .",
    "however , it is still unclear why the intersite charge transfer occurs only in lree , and furthermore why lacfo has the highest transition temperature .",
    "the aim of the present work is to address these questions .",
    "we perform relaxed and fixed magnetic - moment calculations for lacfo and lucfo ; the two representative systems exhibiting charge transfer and charge disproportionation , respectively .",
    "we show that the crystal field splitting and the relative ordering between cu-@xmath6 and fe-@xmath7 states are the key parameters , determining the type of valence transition .",
    "the total energy calculations were performed within the context of density functional theory using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functional  @xcite and the projector - augmented - wave pseudopotentials  @xcite as implemented in the vasp package  @xcite .",
    "an energy cutoff of 600 ev was chosen for the expansion of the plane waves .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled using a 11@xmath2211@xmath2211 monkhorst - pack @xmath23-mesh .",
    "the wannier functions ( wfs ) were constructed by wannier90 package  @xcite .",
    "the x - ray - absorption spectra calculations were performed within multiplet ligand field theory ( mlft ) as implemented in the code of ref .  .",
    "in this method we obtain mlft parameters from _ ab initio _ calculations unlike usual mlft methods where these parameters are fit to experimental data .",
    "-site - ordered @xmath0cfo ( @xmath0 : lanthanides ) double perovskites .",
    "( b ) the corresponding partial density of states ( pdos ) calculated for lacfo and lucfo .",
    "the pdos corresponding to the fe-@xmath7 , cu-@xmath7 and o-@xmath21 states are indicated by the solid ( red ) line , dashed ( blue ) line and shaded ( blue ) area , respectively .",

    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , the fe atom is located at the center of a tilted feo@xmath28 octahedron , whereas the cu atom is coordinated with four o atoms , together forming a square planar cuo@xmath2 unit  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have used the experimentally - identified structural parameters for both lacfo and lucfo at high temperature  @xcite . in order to get insight into the character of the bands around the fermi level , @xmath29",
    ", we first study the electronic structure properties of lacfo and lucfo in the non - spin - polarized configuration . fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](b ) shows the corresponding partial density of states ( pdos ) for the two compounds . as can be seen , in this configuration , lacfo and lucfo are both metallic , in agreement with the experiment .",
    "the octahedral crystal field acting on fe splits its @xmath7 orbitals into two manifolds @xmath25 and @xmath30 .",
    "the three @xmath25 orbitals span the energy region from -1.5 to 0.5 ev around @xmath29 ( which is set to zero ) .",
    "the two fe-@xmath30 orbitals are found to be above @xmath29 .",
    "cu-@xmath7 states , on the other hand , are almost fully occupied .",
    "the only exception is cu-@xmath6 , remaining partially unoccupied .",
    "the pdos in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) indicates a substantial overlap of fe-@xmath7 , cu-@xmath7 , and o-@xmath21 states , therefore suggesting a strong hybridization between these states around @xmath29 in both lacfo and lucfo . a tight - binding model can shed a light on the origin of the experimentally - observed different ground states in lacfo and lucfo at low temperatures .",
    "considering the fact that the energy bands around @xmath29 are predominantly made of fe-@xmath7 and cu-@xmath6 , we have accordingly constructed a set of wfs for the respective conduction and valence bands using a basis set composed of these atomic orbitals . for both lacfo and lucfo , the corresponding crystal field splitting ( @xmath31 ) as well as the differential onsite energies between the fe-@xmath25 and cu-@xmath6 orbitals ( @xmath26 ) are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath31 in lucfo is larger than that in lacfo .",
    "this implies that fe in lucfo has less tendency to be in a @xmath32 state . on the other hand , @xmath26 in lucfo is smaller than that in lacfo and , thus , less energy cost is required to fill the cu-@xmath6 states in lucfo than it does in lacfo . as a result of the weak crystal",
    "filed splitting and large @xmath26 , all fe-@xmath7 ( cu-@xmath6 ) orbitals become fully occupied ( unoccupied ) in lacfo .",
    "accordingly , fe goes to a fe@xmath33 state and cu stabilizes in an unusual cu@xmath33 state .      as mentioned earlier , upon increasing temperature an intersite charge transfer accompanied with the antiferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition",
    "occurs in lacfo . in order to understand the mechanism of intersite charge transfer",
    ", we examine the evolution of electronic structure of lacfo from an antiferromagnetic state to a non - magnetic state by constraining the size and direction of the magnetic moment on fe . to be consistent with the experiment",
    ", we adopt the g - type afm spin arrangement for the fe atoms .",
    "we start from the fully spin - polarized configuration ( @xmath34  =  5.0@xmath35 ) and examine how the density of states evolves by decreasing @xmath34 .",
    "the calculated pdos for lacfo indicates that this system is an insulator with a band gap changing from 0.87 to 0.24 ev , when reducing @xmath34 from 4.9 to 4.0@xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with the experimental finding that lacfo in the afm phase behaves like an insulator . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , at high magnetic states , while the pdos of fe-@xmath7 are either fully ( for @xmath34  =  4.9@xmath35 ) or predominantly ( for @xmath34  =  4.0@xmath35 ) below @xmath29 , the corresponding cu-@xmath6 states appear above @xmath29 . for both the cu-@xmath6 and fe-@xmath7 , the position of the respective pdos is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath34 . upon decreasing @xmath34 , the cu-@xmath6 ( fe-@xmath7 ) states shift to lower ( higher ) energies , and eventually cross @xmath29 when @xmath34 becomes 3.0@xmath35 or less ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "orbitals ( red lines ) and fe-@xmath7 orbitals ( cyan shaded area , lightly shaded in grayscale ) as calculated under various constrained magnetizations .",
    "the red shaded area ( darkly shaded in grayscale ) indicates the contribution of cu@xmath6.,width=316 ]    cfo compounds .",
    "( b ) the excess and depletion charge distributions obtained from subtracting the total charge density of lacfo in @xmath34=4.9@xmath35 from that in @xmath34=2.1@xmath35 .",
    "the excess ( depletion ) charges are indicated in red ( blue ) color .",
    "the inset shows a magnified view of the excess and depletion charge distributions around the central cu atom.,width=316 ]    as a result , at low magnetic states , the cu-@xmath6 ( fe-@xmath7 ) states become mainly occupied ( unoccupied ) , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , the o-@xmath21 orbitals play an important role in this process , as proposed in ref .  .",
    "to elucidate this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) we show the excess and depletion charge distributions obtained from subtracting the total charge density of lacfo with @xmath34  =  4.9@xmath35 from that with @xmath34  =  2.1@xmath35 .",
    "the cu atoms clearly gain a pure excess charge , spatially distributed in their @xmath6 orbital . on the other hand ,",
    "the fe atoms undergo a partial charge loss , as expected .",
    "this charge loss is obviously compensated by the excess charge on cu atoms , but importantly mediated through the o atoms . to be more precise , by lowering @xmath34 , the charge density around o atoms is redistributed such that cu - o ( fe - o ) bonds become more ( less ) electron - rich .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath4 configuration of copper in the afm state transforms into a @xmath5 configuration in the non - magnetic phase .",
    "consequently the intersite charge transfer observed in lacfo ( and the other lree compounds ) is expected to be magnetically driven .    ) between the magnetically constrained configurations and the self - consistently obtained g - type antiferromagnetic configuration as a function of the absolute value of @xmath34 calcualted for lacfo(triangles ) and lucfo(circles).the inset shows a magnified view of @xmath36 for @xmath373.0@xmath35 .",
    "( b ) optimized lattice constant as a function of absolute value of @xmath34 for lacfo.,width=316 ]    we have also performed the constrained magnetization calculations for lucfo ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that when @xmath38  4.0@xmath35 , the cu-@xmath6 orbital becomes partially filled .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath34 dependence of the total energy reveals why lacfo prefers the ground state lacu@xmath39fe@xmath40o@xmath3 , whereas lucfo prefers lucu@xmath39fe@xmath41fe@xmath42o@xmath3 at low temperature .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) shows the relative energy ( @xmath36 ) between the magnetically constrained configurations and the self - consistently obtained g - type afm configuration for the both systems .",
    "it is clear that in comparison with lacfo , lucfo requires increasingly higher energy cost to be driven away from its self - consistent configuration into a configuration with larger @xmath34 .",
    "this accordingly means that fe in lucfo has much less tendency to be in the fe@xmath33 state than it does in lacfo .",
    "this situation completely changes when @xmath34 is lowered from its self - consistent value . in this case",
    ", the calculated @xmath36 is mildly sensitive to the value of @xmath34 and its seems to be relatively smaller for lucfo than for lacfo .",
    "this indicates that cu@xmath43 can be easily formed in lucfo .",
    "considering the facts that cu normally prefers to be in cu@xmath43 state and fe generally disfavors fe@xmath44 state , it becomes clear why lucfo behaves as if it has fewer fe@xmath44 ions . on this basis",
    ", we can further expect that as the temperature decreases the cu@xmath43 state remains unaffected , whereas the fe@xmath45 ions transform to fe@xmath33 and fe@xmath46 states .",
    "in contrast , lacfo requires less energy cost to be in high spin state .",
    "therefore , it prefers to transfer charge from its cu to fe atoms and form fe@xmath33 ( 3cu@xmath17 + 4fe@xmath20 3cu@xmath12 + 4fe@xmath33 ) .",
    "a noteworthy point is how the lattice constant is affected by the changes in magnetization . for this purpose , we first fixed the position of fe at its symmetric point , then relaxed the position of o , and eventually optimized the lattice parameter . according to these calculations , when @xmath34  =  4.9@xmath47 , the lattice constant reaches its maximum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4](b ) ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the experimentally - observed volume expansion in the afm phase .",
    "yamada @xmath19  @xcite have also reported x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) for the lree group . according to their measurements , at low temperatures the cu-@xmath9 edge splits into two peak structures , which is an indication that the ground state of cu has @xmath4 configuration  @xcite .",
    "the relative intensity of these two peaks has been observed to be dependent on the size of @xmath0 .",
    "while it is higher for the higher energy peak in the case of @xmath0=nd , it turns out to be lower for the same peak for @xmath0=tb . to examine whether our calculation can reproduce this finding , we have simulated the cu-@xmath9 absorption edge using the mlft method  @xcite .",
    "we consider a cluster composed of cu-@xmath7 and the core shell cu-@xmath21 states .",
    "we also include o-@xmath21 ligand states `` @xmath48 '' , but only those which have a finite overlap with the cu-@xmath7 states , as extracted from the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "due to the fact that spin - orbit coupling is small , s@xmath49 is _ approximately _ a good quantum number , and its expectation value for the ground state would be 0 , i.e. a spin singlet .",
    "the higher order @xmath7 slater integrals f@xmath50 and f@xmath51 , the interaction between the core - hole and valence electrons as well as the core - hole spin - orbit coupling have been deduced from the atomic hartree fock values while the charge transfer energy @xmath52 and the hubbard u are , as usual , taken as adjustable parameters in the calculation  @xcite .    setting @xmath52 and @xmath53 to the typical values for transition metal oxides",
    ", we can successfully reproduce the experimentally - observed spectra with the pronounced two - peak structure in the cu-@xmath9 edge .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , almost the entire spectral weight comes from the absorption of incident lights , polarized in the @xmath54 plane .",
    "this reflects the fact that on each copper site the cu-@xmath6 orbital ( as defined in the local coordinate system ) is the only possible final state for the excited core electrons  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the relative intensity of the peaks strongly depends on the value of @xmath53 but rather insensitive to the choice of @xmath52 .",
    "note that the hubbard u parameter is taken as an adjustable parameter in our calculations .",
    "however , as a cross - check we have separately estimated the possible range of u for cu-3d states in lacfo by performing a set of constrained local density approximation calculations within both the full - potential@xcite and pseudo - potential@xcite formalisms .",
    "the respective value of u is accordingly found to be in the range of 7.81 ev ( obtained from the full - potential calculations ) to 10.43 ev ( obtained from the pseudo - potential calculations ) .",
    "this range obviously includes u = 8.6 ev , the value that we have chosen for lacfo in our xas calculations . as can be seen , by increasing @xmath53 , the spectral weight transfers monotonously from the lower energy peak to the higher one .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ground state can be excited into two different excited states , namely @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( where @xmath48 denotes the hybridizing ligand states as described above ) . the observed splitting of the @xmath9 edge originates from the core - hole valence electron interaction .",
    "increasing @xmath53 increases the energy of placing the excited core electron into the @xmath8-shell .",
    "hence , the related processes ( leading to final state @xmath57 ) are energetically shifted up leading to the observed spectral weight transfer  @xcite .",
    "this effect allows us to exploit the spectral structure as an experimental probe for the onsite interaction strength @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , when we revisit the experimental spectra for the different @xmath0cfo materials in this light , we see that an increase in the onsite interaction should be expected for larger @xmath0 atoms , consistent with more localized cu-@xmath7 orbitals and a higher t@xmath58 , as depicted by the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . +     x - ray absorption edge of cu calculated for @xmath0cfo with different values for the cu onsite interaction parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the incident light is assumed to be either non - polarized ( black solid line ) or polarized parallel ( blue dashed line ) or perpendicular ( red shaded area ) to the crystalline @xmath59-plane .",
    "the background phase diagram indicates the relation between the magnetic phase transition with the size ( @xmath60 ) of the @xmath0 atom in @xmath0cfo .",
    "@xmath61 denotes the neel temperature .",
    ", width=326 ]",
    "in conclusion , we studied the mechanism of charge transfer / disproportionation in the double perovskite transition metal oxides @xmath0cu@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 . examining their electronic structure at various constrained magnetic configurations , we shed light on the origin of the observed magnetic and valence transitions in these systems .",
    "it was further explained , why the size of the rare earth element can be the main parameter determining the type of valence transition in such systems .",
    "we also calculated the x - ray absorption spectra for @xmath0cfo compounds and confirmed the presence of the experimentally - reported two peak structure at cu-@xmath9-edge .",
    "the relative intensity of these two peaks were shown to be sensitive to the strength ( and hence applicable as a probe ) of the onsite interaction .",
