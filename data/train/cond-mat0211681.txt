    "a general expression for the current correlators is derived below : it is a sum over transitions between pairs of energy levels .",
    "this expression is very similar to the one obtained by van hove @xcite in the framework of neutron scattering theory . using this sum over transitions we will identify the positive and negative frequency part of the correlator as having distinct , well - defined , separately - measurable , physical interpretations , namely : the emission and absorption spectra .",
    "this picture will enable us to analyze in what type of measurement the zero - point fluctuations will have an effect on the measured spectrum .",
    "it will also enable us to derive a detailed balance relation out of equilibrium for a landauer - type system which consists of a point scatterer connected through two one - dimensional single - channel conducting arms , to two terminals whose chemical potentials differ .",
    "this condition keeps the system in a stationary nonequilibrium state .",
    "finally , a kubo formula for the differential conductivity is derived for a wide class of systems out of equilbrium , and is verified analytically for the above landauer - type case .",
    "consider the current correlator for a stationary system ( i.e. with no dependence on @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 of a quantum system ( `` antenna '' ) , characterized by a density matrix which is diagonal in the eigenstate basis .",
    "@xmath4 are the eigenstates of the antenna with energies @xmath5 and populations @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is a space average @xcite of the time - dependent current operator in the heisenberg representation , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the antenna , taken to be time independent , but otherwise very general , _ including interactions_.    if the ( stationary ) system were describable classically , then one would have @xmath10 and it would be clear what the time - dependent current fluctuations were : the average - over - realizations of the product of the values of the current at different times . however , in the quantum case the operators @xmath11 for different times do not commute .",
    "therefore the quantum correlator can not , in general , be given this simple interpretation .",
    "actually , in the quantum case @xmath12 is in general _ complex _ and not symmetric , but just satisfies : @xmath13 which means that _ it is not a directly measurable quantity _ in the sense that the product of the ( real ) current values that appear , say , on some ampermeter screen at different times does not give @xmath12 .",
    "its fourier transform ( to which we shall also refer , for brevity , as the correlator ) : @xmath14 is also nonsymmetric , @xmath15 although it is obviously real ( see eq.([sq ] ) ) .",
    "this can be seen@xcite by inserting the identity operator @xmath16 in eq.([defs ] ) and performing the time - integration , which yields : @xmath17 this expression is not symmetric with respect to @xmath18 since @xmath6 usually decreases with @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath19 has the following important physical significance . if the system is coupled , through a small term which is linear in @xmath20 , to a second system ( see examples below ) , then , by the fermi golden rule , @xmath19 is proportional to the transition rate between the initial state @xmath21 and the final state @xmath22 , for which @xmath23",
    ". therefore , for @xmath24 it is proportional to the emission rate and for @xmath25 it is proportional to the absorption rate @xcite .",
    "for example , if the second system is the free em field , then @xmath26 is proportional to the energy emission rate @xcite into the vacuum state of this field ( i.e. the state of the em field with occupation number @xmath27 ) , and for @xmath25 it is proportional to the energy absorption rate from an em field with a given photon , i.e. , with @xmath28 .",
    "another example is provided by a system which is coupled to a measuring device @xcite ( e.g. , a resonant circuit ) .",
    "then @xmath19 is proportional to the energy transfer rate between the system and the measuring - device : the terms with @xmath29 describe transitions in which an energy of @xmath30 is transferred from the system to the measuring device , while terms with @xmath31 describe transitions in which an energy of @xmath32 is transferred from the measuring device to the system . when @xmath33 , only the first type of terms will remain and @xmath19 will be the emission spectrum while @xmath34 will be the absorption spectrum . thus , the two branches of @xmath19 yield two physically interesting and separately - measurable quantities .    in the case",
    "when the antenna is in equilibrium at a temperature @xmath35 and time - reversal symmetry holds , one finds the detailed balance relation @xcite @xmath36    this detailed balance relation ensures that the system remains in equilibrium , by taking care that the asymmetry @xmath37 , i.e. , the difference between the upward transitions ( absorption ) and the downward ones ( emission ) is compensated by the difference between the higher and lower thermal occupations . in section 3 the above relation is generalized for a particular nonequilibrium system , where it serves to keep the latter in its nonequilibrium , though stationary , state . from eq.([db ] ) one sees that only for low frequencies @xmath38 , will the classical symmetry , @xmath39 , hold . in the time domain this means that the classical symmetry , @xmath40 , becomes valid only for late times @xmath41 .    the customary way to treat",
    "the quantum case is @xcite to consider the symmetrized correlator @xmath42 which is real and symmetric like the classical one .",
    "however , for a wide class of noise detection schemes and in particular for a detector in its ground - state @xmath43 is _ not _ , the measured correlator , since it contains the zero - point fluctuations .",
    "for example , if the antenna is in equilibrium at a temperature @xmath35 , it follows from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite that for @xmath44 one has @xmath45\\omega,$ ] where @xmath46 is the fourier transform of @xmath43 and @xmath47^{-1}$ ] is the planck function .",
    "this means that @xmath48 even when @xmath49 , and the antenna is in its ground state .",
    "since being in the ground state the antenna can not radiate energy , @xmath46 can not be considered as the correlator measured by detecting the radiation @xcite .    to conclude",
    ", the measured quantity will generally not contain the emission and absorption in a symmetric combination .",
    "this was shown for particular situations of quantum noise measurement in electronic transport @xcite as well as in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the more physical correlator ( and its power spectrum ) is the one without symmetrization .",
    "its transform is given by a sum over transitions - downward ones in the case of positive frequency , and upward ones in the case of negative frequency .",
    "each of these two branches has its own distinct physical significance , the emission and absorption spectrum , that may in principle be detected separately .",
    "we now consider current fluctuations @xcite for the landauer model .",
    "a point - like elastic scatterer is connected through two ideal single - channel conducting ballistic arms to two fermion reservoirs , 1 , and 2 , with chemical potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "@xmath50 is the voltage , and it is assumed that @xmath51 .",
    "we consider non - interacting electrons and ignore spin .",
    "the single - particle scattering - states with energy @xmath52 which corresponds to a wave that is incoming on arm @xmath53 , partially reflected back into it and partially transmitted into the other arms , is : @xmath54 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath55 with @xmath56 ; @xmath57 , @xmath58 is a normalization length , @xmath59 the electron mass and @xmath60 the distance of a point on arm @xmath61 from the scatterer .",
    "@xmath62 is the element of the unitary scattering matrix , and it is assumed to be energy independent unless otherwise stated . to specify that a state @xmath63 comes from terminal @xmath64 we shall write @xmath65 the current operator on arm @xmath66 is @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath70 s .",
    "we assume that the _ measured _ current is the average @xmath71 over a segment @xmath72 far away from the scatterer which satisfies : @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and @xmath18 is the frequency of the measured noise which is assumed to satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "these conditions ensure that the correlators are independent of the length and position of the segment @xmath77 ; i.e , it has no spatial dependence , which is not addressed in experiments .    to describe the current noise consider the correlator , given by eq .",
    "( [ sq ] ) we emphasize again that at least for some types of noise detection , it is eq .",
    "( [ defs ] ) and _ not _ its symmetrized version , which gives the measured noise if the detector is cold enough , i.e. , when excitation of the system by the detector is unlikely so that the absorption is negligible .",
    "the states @xmath21 are given according to the landauer picture by the eigenstates of the system ( i.e. , slater determinants ) labelled by specifying a set @xmath78 of the occupied single - particle states ( the scattering states @xmath79 emanating from the two reservoirs ) :    @xmath80    and the corresponding probabilities ( for a more general derivation see ref .  )",
    "are : @xmath81 \\times \\frac{1}{z_2 } exp[-\\beta\\sum_{n\\in 2}(\\epsilon_{n_i}-(\\mu - ev/2))n_i ] , \\label{defpi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83\\ ] ] @xmath53 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath84 correspond to a situation in which the occupations in the gas in the one - dimensional system are determined by grand - canonical probabilities that depend on the chemical potential and the temperature of the terminals that supply the electrons to the system . from eqs.([defpi ] ) and ( [ defi ] ) it follows that at zero temperature @xmath85 for any @xmath86 except for one state , which we name a _ cold transport state _ which is given by : @xmath87 in this cold transport state all the @xmath79 s are occupied up to an energy @xmath88 if @xmath89 and up to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) if @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore ,",
    "this state , although it is the stationary state with the lowest energy among those that are made possible by the two terminals , is not a ground state , and since it carries current , it is not even an equilibrium state .    in the sum in eq.([sq ] ) , the non - diagonal matrix element @xmath93 is nonzero only if @xmath94 differs from @xmath95 by moving one particle from an occupied state , @xmath96 to a previously unoccupied state , @xmath97 i.e. , @xmath94 is of the form @xmath98 ( up to a fermionic factor of @xmath99 , that will play no role below . )",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath100 appear in a term @xmath101 . in what follows we consider only @xmath102 and therefore neglect this term . in experiments the integration in eq.([defs ] ) is limited by the sampling time of the experiment , @xmath103 , and as a result @xmath104 is smoothed into a peak with a width of @xmath105 which means that the condition @xmath106 actually means @xmath107 .",
    "we therefore have :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 , and where now the summation over @xmath110 and @xmath111 is over all _ single - particle _ states @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( with _ single - particle _ energies @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) which are occupied and unoccupied , respectively , in @xmath21 .",
    "now we divide the summation in eq .",
    "( [ svanhove - auto ] ) into four partial sums , according to the four possible types of transitions : two auto - terminal ones and two cross - terminal ones ( shown in fig . 1 for @xmath116 in the cold transport state ) :    @xmath117    where @xmath118 contains only the transitions from states with @xmath119 to states @xmath120 .",
    "explicitly : @xmath121        each of these four sums can be evaluated separately by calculating the current matrix elements in eq.([svanhove - auto ] ) , transforming the sums over @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( which are implicit in the sums over @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) into integrals , performing the summation over @xmath86 according to eqs .",
    "( [ defi ] ) and ( [ defpi ] ) , and integrating using the condition @xmath124 and the unitarity of the scattering matrix , @xmath125 .",
    "the final results are : @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 where , @xmath129 is the transmission from arm 1 to 2 .",
    "substitution in eq.([partialsums ] ) yields : @xmath130+\\frac{2e^2   \\widetilde{t}^2}{h}f(\\hbar\\omega ) \\label{sfinal }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 .",
    "( [ sfinal ] ) is the non - symmetrized power spectrum , at finite frequency ( positive or negative ) , voltage and temperature .",
    "it has been previously obtained by aguado and kouwenhoven @xcite ( they use an opposite convention for the sign of @xmath18 ) .",
    "( [ sfinal ] ) is consistent with the zero - temperature limit , i.e. , the cold transport case , that was obtained by lesovik and loosen @xcite . unlike the symmetrized version that was derived by yang @xcite and de jong and beenakker @xcite , here @xmath132 .",
    "since the system is not in equilibrium , the detailed - balance condition eq.([db ] ) is not satisfied , however , a modified version of it does exists . to obtain it ,",
    "note that eqs.([defpi ] ) and ( [ sab ] ) , or ( [ s12]),([s21 ] ) and ( [ s22 ] ) imply :    @xmath133    @xmath134    in equilibrium , @xmath135 and the last two relations have the form of first two and then , by eq.([partialsums ] ) , the ordinary detailed - balance relation , eq .",
    "( [ db ] ) is recovered .",
    "the finite voltage creates a nonequilibrium but stationary state which is maintained by virtue of more complicated detailed - balance relations between upward and downward transitions , given by the above four equations .",
    "in particular these relations imply that @xmath136 even at zero temperature which is not surprising since in the cold transport state , eq .",
    "( [ deftransportgas ] ) , downward transitions are possible from occupied states with @xmath92 within the energy window @xmath137 $ ] into the empty states with @xmath89 and within the same energy window .",
    "that is , emission is possible .",
    "another conclusion arising from the above four equations is that in order to recover the classical symmetry @xmath138 , the condition @xmath139 is not longer enough and should be replaced by : @xmath140 .",
    "here we would like to make another application of the point of view of section [ general ] .",
    "we again allow @xcite for the antenna a large class of nonequilibrium situations - all those in which the density matrix is diagonal in the eigenstate basis ( and it therefore commutes with the hamiltonian ) .",
    "this may include electron - electron interactions and the possibility that @xmath141 .",
    "a useful example to have in mind is a landauer - type transport system of section 3 , which has a two - terminal linear conductance , per spin channel , of @xmath142    we use the explicit exact expression of eq.[sq ] for the current power - spectrum @xmath19 .",
    "as emphasized in section [ general ] , its important physical significance is that it gives @xcite the emission rate into the vacuum ( i.e. the state of the em field where all @xmath143 ) for @xmath144 and the absorption rate for @xmath25 and an em field with one photon , @xmath145 .",
    "we first take the ( possibly d.c .",
    "driven ) `` antenna '' to be in a given ( usually the lowest ) state consistent with the external driving ( this will be valid , for example , when the reservoirs that feed the antenna are at @xmath146 and there is either no coupling with any additional thermal bath , or when that coupling is with a bath at @xmath147 , and no appreciable heating by the d.c . current has taken place . in the latter case ,",
    "some tendency toward equilibrating the chemical potentials of the left- and right- moving electrons may occur , with a reduction of the d.c .",
    "current , which is of no particular concern to us ) . in the case of the landauer - type system of section 3 , this lowest state is the cold transport one , defined in eq .",
    "[ deftransportgas ] .",
    "the energy absorption rate , @xmath148 , by the antenna from a _ classical field _ ( with @xmath149 photons and a negligible spontaneous component of the emitted radiation ) with a frequency @xmath144 is given via the usual treatment @xcite by : @xmath150 the emission rate , @xmath151 is given by @xmath152    the _ net _ absorption rate , @xmath153 is given by the difference between eqs .",

    "[ fdt ] is the simple but nontrivial generalization of the kubo formula @xcite for the current - carrying , nonequilibrium , case .",
    "the antisymmetric combination appearing on the lhs corresponds to the fourier transform of the commutator of the heisenberg current operators at different times .",
    "a similar expression was obtained by lesovik and loosen @xcite and by lesovik @xcite .",
    "here we have interpreted it physically and put it in a general context    it is straightforward to generalize the above treatment to the case where the antenna is not at its lowest possible state , but has a density matrix ( assumed to be diagonal in the eigenstates basis ) which allows the population of a number of states . the general form of the result of the _ net _ absorption rate is still valid . _ therefore , our principal result , eq",
