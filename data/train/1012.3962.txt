    "regular languages are also closed under complementation , one can redefine them as the smallest class containing the finite languages and closed under boolean operations , concatenation and star . in this new formulation",
    ", a natural question is that of the _ generalized star height _ of a regular language , which is the minimum number of nested stars required to define the language when boolean operations are allowed .",
    "it is not clear who first considered the problem of generalized star height , but mcnaughton and papert reported in their 1971 monograph  @xcite that this problem had been open `` for many years '' .",
    "there exist regular languages of star height 0 and 1 , but it is not even known whether there exists a language of star height 2 .",

    "we consider regular languages of star height 0 , which are also called _ star - free_. in 1965 , schtzenberger proved  @xcite that a language is star - free if and only if its syntactic monoid is _ group - free _ , that is , has only trivial subgroups .",
    "an equivalent condition is that the minimal deterministic automaton of a star - free language is _ permutation - free _ , that is , has only trivial permutations .",
    "another point of view is that these automata are _ counter - free _ , since they can not count modulo any integer greater than 1 .",

    "count to a threshold _ , that is @xmath1 _ or more_. such automata are called _ aperiodic , _ and this is the term that we use .",
    "the _ state complexity _ of a regular language  @xcite is the number of states in the minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting that language .",
    "we prefer the equivalent concept of _ quotient complexity _",
    "@xcite , which is the number of distinct left quotients of the language , because quotient complexity has some advantages .",
    "the _ quotient complexity of an operation _ in a subclass of regular languages is the maximal quotient complexity of the language resulting from the operation , as a function of the quotient complexities of the operands when they range over all the languages in the subclass .",
    "the complexities of basic operations in the class of regular languages were studied by maslov  @xcite and yu , zhuang and salomaa  @xcite .",
    "the complexities of operations were also considered in several subclasses of regular languages : unary  @xcite , finite  @xcite , ideal  @xcite , closed  @xcite , prefix - free  @xcite , suffix - free  @xcite , bifix- , factor- , and subword - free  @xcite , and convex  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of operations can be significantly lower in a subclass of regular languages than in the general case .",
    "we prove that this is _ not _ the case for star - free languages , which meet the bounds for regular languages , with small exceptions .",
