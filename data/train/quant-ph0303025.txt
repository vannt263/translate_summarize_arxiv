    "<S> it is questionable that grover algorithm may be more valuable than a classical one , when a partial information is given in a unstructured database . in this letter , to consider quantum search when a partial information is given , we replace the fourier transform in the grover algorithm with the haar wavelet transform . </S>",
    "<S> we then , given a partial information @xmath0 to a unstructured database of size @xmath1 , show that there is the improved speedup , @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that we have a problem of finding a desired one of unstructured @xmath1 items . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that a classical search algrithm may take @xmath3 times , but the fast quantum search algorithm provides the quadratic speedup , @xmath4.@xcite the quantum algorithm whose central idea is amplitude amplification was first provided by grover in 1996.@xcite@xcite it is well - known that grover algorithm is 1)optimal in the context of applying unitary operators repeatdly and 2)efficient in searching a target of a unstructured database . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not evident that , when a partial information is given , the grover algorithm is still more valuable than a classical one . in this letter , we provide the quantum search algorithm which is able to benefit from a partial information . </S>",
    "<S> the key building block in our construction is the ( haar ) wavelet transform instead of the fourier transform in the grover algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> + let us first consider the grover algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> a bijection between a database and quantum states is necessary before applying the grover algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> if a superposition of @xmath1 states is initially prepared , the grover algorithm amplifies the amplitude of the target state up to around one , while those of other states dwindle down to nearly zeros . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude amplification is performed by two inversion operations : inversion about the target by the oracle and inversion about the initial state by the fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> noting the fact that two simultaneous reflections about two mirrors crossing by an angle @xmath5 induce @xmath6 rotation , one may imagine that the inversions in the grover algorithm rotate the initial state around the target state.@xcite if the target state and the initial state are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively,(here the initial state is prepared by the fourier transform of a state @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 ) the inversion operators is expressed as    @xmath11    since @xmath12 , the grover operator is written as    @xmath13    then , after applying the operator @xmath4 times , the final state comes to    @xmath14 , which is @xmath15 , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the query complexity of this algorithm , the number of callings of the oracle , is therefore @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we here note that the running time has nothing to do with the choice of @xmath9 . + to consider the partial information , let us think about the following situation . </S>",
    "<S> +    _ suppose that hanyang university library has @xmath1(@xmath17 , for some @xmath18 ) books . </S>",
    "<S> each book has a code number identifying itself . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the library decides to label new code numbers to each book since a better way to classify books has provided . </S>",
    "<S> a labelling machine is applied to the tedious job . </S>",
    "<S> each code is composed of @xmath19 numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the first numbers must be @xmath20 , since they stands for the region . </S>",
    "<S> and hanyang university is in south korea , so the second number is @xmath20.the other numbers stand for the category each book is included . </S>",
    "<S> an earlier number means a larger category . </S>",
    "<S> the rules of labeling a code number is that the @xmath21-th number , @xmath22 , is in @xmath23 $ ] for @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the following codes are a good example , _    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25    the first code means @xmath26 and the next one @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the first two numbers @xmath28 stands for the region , and hanyang university . to aid the searching a book in the library </S>",
    "<S> , the library also has implemented the grover algorithm in a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> + after the labelling is completed , one discovers a fault in the machine . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the library decides to do labelling again , fixing the fault in the labelling machine . </S>",
    "<S> they then recommend to apply the grover algorithm to whom may be concerned to search a book , during labelling . </S>",
    "<S> + dr . </S>",
    "<S> lee , a postdoc in physics , has to submit his research paper by tomorrow @xmath29 a.m. it is now 6 p.m. he wish to fill the reference section in the paper , but the library in mess blocks his work . </S>",
    "<S> the director of the library recommends him to try the grover algorithm , but it was calculated , based on the number of books @xmath1 , that @xmath30 hours is the running time of the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , he concludes that the grover algorithm can not help him . at that moment </S>",
    "<S> , he gets a call from the library that the only @xmath21-th number of all code numbers is correct .     </S>",
    "<S> + it is sure that the grover algorithm can not complete the search task in time , since it takes over @xmath30 hours . </S>",
    "<S> the only thing that dr . </S>",
    "<S> lee can use in order to overcome his hopeless situation , is the fact that only the @xmath21-th number was correctly labelled . </S>",
    "<S> the partial information may save his problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , the grover algorithm can not benefit from the partial information of this problem . + </S>",
    "<S> we here introduce the fast wavelet quantum search algorithm(wqsa ) , which is a modification of the grover algorithm by replacing the fourier transform with the haar wavelet transform , to resolve the situation of dr . </S>",
    "<S> lee . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that to apply the following operator    @xmath31    is one iteration of the wqsa . </S>",
    "<S> the haar wavelet transform @xmath32 is represented @xmath33 where    @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath35 the haar 1-level decomposition operator as follows ;    @xmath36_{2^k \\times 2^k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have used @xmath37 as the @xmath38 unit matrix and @xmath39 as the @xmath40 zero matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the wavelet transform @xmath32 is unitary since the operator @xmath41 is unitary . </S>",
    "<S> + since the operator is composed of the wavelet transform , consistently , the initial state is prepared by applying the inverse wavelet transform @xmath42 to a state @xmath9 , i.e. , the initial state is now @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the power of our wqsa appears in the initialization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite remarkable that the state @xmath44 is a superposition of @xmath45 states , where @xmath46(@xmath21 is given by @xmath47 ) , while the state @xmath48 is a superposition of @xmath1 states . </S>",
    "<S> then it is expected that the running time is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> choosing the initial state as @xmath44 , @xmath49 when the target state exists in the restricted domain of the @xmath45 states , we look forward to an improved speedup with the partial information . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath50 , by setting @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath24 , and @xmath53 , the state @xmath44 is explicitly ,    @xmath54    the following diagram shows the set of states composing @xmath44 .    . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath55axis runs from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> when the initial state is @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the running time is the same to that of the grover algorithm since the lowest two retangulars include all states.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we thus arrive at the following proposition .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that we solve the problem of finding a desired one in the set @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> given a partial information that the target state is in the subset @xmath61 , we complete the search task in @xmath62 times by choosing the initial state as @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> proof ) let the target state @xmath64 . let us take the initial state as @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it suffices to show that it takes @xmath62 times for the wqsa to find the target state with the following setting . </S>",
    "<S> + let @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelet quantum search operator is    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the haar wavelet transform . </S>",
    "<S> applying the operator @xmath42 to the @xmath9 , we have the initial state    @xmath67 and the state    @xmath68 iterations of the operator @xmath69 create the following state ,    @xmath70 iterations is    @xmath71    , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have shown that the total number of iterations is @xmath62 . if we denote @xmath74 and @xmath46 , then the running time is written as @xmath2  q.e.d . </S>",
    "<S> + let us revisit the dr . </S>",
    "<S> lee s problem.the partial information that the @xmath21-th number @xmath22 is correctly labelled leads dr . </S>",
    "<S> lee to apply the wqsa so that the reference section is filled in time . </S>",
    "<S> however note that there is no improvement in running time when the intial state is @xmath58 or @xmath59 since , in those cases , the initial state is still a superposition of @xmath1 states . </S>",
    "<S> therfore , from the proposition , we know that he can complete the submission in time if the @xmath21 is larger than @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> + we have exerted how to utilize a partial information , in order to enhance quantum search . </S>",
    "<S> our construction provides a way for quantum search to benefit from a partial information . </S>",
    "<S> since the running time of the grover algorithm has nothing to do with the choice of unitary operator , the complexity of the wqsa is the same to the grover algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have obtained the speedup @xmath2 by preparing the initial state as @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the running time of the wqsa depends on the choice of @xmath47 , while that of the grover algorithm does not . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the state @xmath44 is a superpositin of states in the restricted domain of @xmath45 states . </S>",
    "<S> the speedup is indeed originated in the initialization . </S>",
    "<S> + finally , let us discuss the haar wavelet basis . </S>",
    "<S> although other wavelet transforms may be applied to the wqsa , we chose the haar wavelet transform .        </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the first half of the haar wavelet basis differs with the second half of the wavelet basis on the phase @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that destructive and constructive interference between states accepts a set of states containing the target and rejects the other states . in this sense , other known wavelet basis , e.g. daubechies s , </S>",
    "<S> are not appropriate to play the role of seclecting a subset of the @xmath1 states . </S>"
