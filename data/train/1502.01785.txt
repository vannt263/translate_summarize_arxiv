    "the magnetic ordering temperatures @xmath0 of gd and dy have been recently shown to track each other in a highly non - monotonic fashion as a function of pressure to @xmath2 gpa ; at higher pressures they deviate markedly , @xmath0 for dy rising rapidly to temperatures well above ambient at 157 gpa.@xcite parallel experiments on dilute magnetic alloys of gd and dy with superconducting y suggest that for pressures above @xmath3  gpa dy is transformed from a magnetically conventional lanthanide into one with an unconventional magnetic state with marked deviations from de gennes scaling,@xcite a state perhaps governed by kondo physics , indicating that the dy ion is nearing a magnetic instability.@xcite an alternate explanation is that the strong enhancement of @xmath0 in dy arises through changes in the crystalline electric field at extreme pressure.@xcite analogous studies on additional lanthanides are recommended to help identify the origin of this anomalous behavior .",
    "the lanthanide tb , which lies between gd and dy in the periodic table , has one fewer 4@xmath4 electron than dy , and is probably less stable magnetically than dy due to its direct proximity to gd , by far the most stable of all magnetic lanthanides .",
    "tb orders antiferromagnetically ( afm ) at @xmath5 230 k followed by a ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition at @xmath5 220 k.@xcite both transition temperatures initially decrease rapidly with pressure at the rate -10 to -12 k / gpa , but above @xmath6 gpa neither transition can be clearly detected in either the ac or dc magnetic susceptibility.@xcite the disappearance of the ordered moment in the susceptibility measurement indicates a transition to either an afm or paramagnetic state above 7 gpa .",
    "electrical resistivity studies should reveal which scenario is correct since both fm and afm order normally lead to a distinct kink in the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "however , recent resistivity and neutron diffraction experiments on tb find that the fm transition decreases with pressure at the rate -16.7 k / gpa to 3.6 gpa;@xcite that the transition could no longer be resolved above 3.6 gpa may be due to appreciable pressure - gradient broadening in the cell which contained no pressure medium .",
    "that magnetic order in tb disappears above 7 gpa seems highly unlikely since both x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) and non - resonant x - ray emission spectroscopy ( xes ) measurements detect no change in tb s valence to 65 gpa and 70 gpa , respectively.@xcite in fact , the xes studies show that tb retains its strong , highly localized magnetic moment ( @xmath7 ) to at least 70 gpa.@xcite    in this paper we present the results of dc electrical resistivity measurements on tb over the temperature range 3.8 - 295 k to pressures as high as 141 gpa , well above the pressure of 53 gpa where tb suffers a 5% volume collapse at the phase transition from hexagonal hr24 to body - centered monoclinic ( bcm).@xcite magnetic order is indeed observed in tb for pressures above 7 gpa . in fact , to 53 gpa @xmath1 follows nearly the same highly non - monotonic pressure dependence found earlier in gd and dy,@xcite but deviates markedly at higher pressures . as the applied pressure passes through 53 gpa , @xmath1 for tb first decreases , but then begins to increase rapidly above 80 gpa .",
    "as suggested for dy , lim0 extreme pressure appears to transport tb into an unconventional magnetic state with an anomalously high magnetic ordering temperature , well above that anticipated from conventional de gennes scaling .",
    "resistivity samples were cut from a tb ingot ( 99.9% pure , material preparation center of the ames laboratory@xcite ) . to generate pressures",
    "well beyond the volume collapse pressure of tb at 53 gpa , a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) made of cube alloy was used.@xcite two separate high - pressure experiments were carried out where pressure was generated by two opposing diamond anvils ( 1/6-carat , type ia ) with 0.35 mm diameter culets beveled at 7@xmath8 to 0.18 mm central flats .",
    "the re gasket ( 6 - 7 mm diameter , 250 @xmath9 m thick ) was preindented to 30 @xmath10 m and a 80 @xmath9 m diameter hole electro - spark drilled through the center . the center section of the preindented gasket surface was filled with a 4:1 cbn - epoxy mixture to insulate the gasket and serve as pressure medium .",
    "the thin tb sample was then placed on top of four thin ( 4 @xmath9 m ) pt leads for a four - point dc electrical resistivity measurement . in an attempt to minimize the effect of the pressure gradient across the sample in this non - hydrostatic pressure environment , in run 1 an elongated sample ( dimensions @xmath118@xmath1280@xmath123 @xmath9m@xmath13 ) was used with the two voltage leads spaced only 5 @xmath9 m apart ( see inset to fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . in run 2",
    "all four pt leads were placed near the corners of the square - shaped sample ( dimensions @xmath1130@xmath1230@xmath125 @xmath9 m ) ( see inset to fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , as in the previous resistivity measurements on dy.@xcite however , from the temperature - dependent resistivity data the pressure gradient was estimated to be approximately the same in both runs .",
    "further details of the non - hydrostatic high pressure resistivity technique are given in a paper by shimizu _",
    "et al_.@xcite    a he - gas driven membrane was utilized to change pressure at any temperature.@xcite the value of the pressure was determined using both the fluorescence@xcite from a small ruby sphere positioned at the edge of the sample and the frequency shift of the diamond vibron via raman spectroscopy.@xcite the ruby pressure was determined at both ambient temperature and a temperature within 20 k of @xmath0 ; the vibron pressure was determined only at ambient temperature .",
    "the values of the pressure given are averaged over the sample to an estimated accuracy of @xmath14 in these experiments temperatures from 3.8 k to 295 k were available using an oxford flow cryostat .",
    "all measurements shown in this paper were carried out with increasing pressure ; diamond anvil failure at the highest pressure ended the experiment .",
    "further experimental details of the dac and cryostat are given elsewhere.@xcite",
    "the present resistivity studies on tb were carried out in two separate experiments . in fig .",
    "1(a ) the electrical resistance @xmath15 from run 1 is plotted versus temperature at 18 different pressures to 135 gpa .",
    "the results from run 2 are shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and span the pressure range 2 - 141 gpa with 17 values .",
    "the onset of magnetic ordering is identified by the kink in the @xmath15 dependence clearly seen near 200 k at 2 gpa , the lowest pressure in each run .",
    "the kink in @xmath15 upon cooling marks the beginning of the suppression of spin - disorder scattering @xmath16 as magnetic ordering sets in.@xcite at higher pressures this kink broadens somewhat into a `` knee '' due to an increasing pressure gradient across the sample , but remains clearly visible to @xmath11115 gpa .    in fig . 2 selected data from fig .",
    "1(b ) are replotted but shifted vertically for clarity so that no curves intersect . in this graph",
    "the red line through the data above the knee gives the phonon contribution @xmath17 to the total measured resistance @xmath15 estimated in the same manner as in our previous work on dy,@xcite as outlined in the next paragraph .",
    "the paramagnetic state of tb yields the relatively flat region of @xmath15 at higher temperature where the red ( phonon ) line overlaps the data . where the red line begins to separate from the data marks the onset of magnetic ordering in some region of the sample . because of the pressure gradient across the sample",
    ", other regions of the sample will have a lower onset temperature , thus broadening the kink into a knee .",
    "the intersection of the phonon resistance ( red curve ) with the red low - temperature tangent curve defines the temperature @xmath18 in fig .",
    "the total measured resistance is the sum of three terms , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the temperature - independent defect resistance , @xmath17 the temperature - dependent phonon resistance , and @xmath16 the temperature - dependent spin - disorder resistance . at temperatures where there is no magnetic ordering in the sample ,",
    "@xmath16 is independent of temperature . above the onset temperature of the knee ,",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath15 is , therefore , due solely to that of @xmath21 the temperature dependence of the phonon resistance is visible over the widest temperature range at that pressure ( 16 gpa in fig .",
    "2 ) where the knee begins at the lowest temperature .",
    "we extrapolate this dependence to 0 k in the temperature region below the knee to yield the temperature - dependent function @xmath22 , the estimated phonon resistance at 16 gpa in run 2 . in run 1",
    "the data at 18 gpa were used in the same way to obtain @xmath23 . since the functional dependence of @xmath17 on temperatures above @xmath24 is seen in fig . 2 to change only slowly with pressure",
    ", we estimate @xmath17 for the other pressures in run 2 by simply multiplying the function @xmath22 by a `` phonon factor '' @xmath25 chosen such that for temperatures above the knee the quantity @xmath26 becomes _ temperature independent _ for @xmath27 .",
    "the values of @xmath25 required are listed in table 1 at all pressures in run 2 to 141 gpa . for pressures of 120 gpa and above",
    ", the knee in @xmath15 apparently begins above 295 k , so that @xmath25 can no longer be estimated directly from the resistance data . for @xmath28 gpa ,",
    "therefore , the value @xmath29 is assumed in table 1 for run 2 and @xmath30 in run 1 .",
    "this is admittedly an oversimplified way to estimate the phonon contribution , but is superior to the assumption made in an earlier study that for many lanthanides @xmath31 is simply a linear function of temperature to 0 k.@xcite    in fig .",
    "3 the extracted spin - disorder resistance @xmath32 is plotted for pressures 5 , 35 , and 86 gpa in run 2 .",
    "the saturation ( maximum ) value of the so obtained spin - disorder resistance @xmath33 in the paramagnetic phase at each pressure is listed in table 1 for run 2 . at 86 gpa , for example , @xmath34 m@xmath35 as seen in fig .",
    "a similar procedure was used to obtain @xmath36 in run 1 .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , the average magnetic ordering temperature @xmath37 in the tb sample is estimated from the point of intersection of two straight ( red ) lines , a horizontal line for temperatures above the onset of the knee , and a line tangent to @xmath16 at lower temperatures . for 86 gpa",
    "it is seen that @xmath38 k. this temperature differs by only 1 k from @xmath39 k , the intersection point of the phonon resistance and the low - temperature tangent lines in fig . 2 at the same pressure .",
    "here we regard @xmath0 to be the average magnetic ordering temperature ( in our previous paper on dy , @xmath18 was used as the ordering temperature@xcite ) .",
    "since the pressure gradient leads to a variation in the value of the magnetic ordering temperature across the sample , we define the maximumordering temperature @xmath40 as the temperature at which the spin - disorder resistance has decreased by 1% . in fig . 3 it is seen that @xmath41 k at 86 gpa .",
    "if @xmath42 @xmath40 gives the value of the magnetic ordering temperature at the center of the cell ( sample ) where the pressure is highest . in fig",
    "3 it is seen that @xmath40 lies 44 k higher than @xmath0 at 86 gpa .",
    "all values of @xmath0 and @xmath43 in run 2 are listed in table 1 .    in fig .",
    "4 @xmath0 and @xmath40 are plotted versus pressure to 141 gpa for runs 1 and 2 on tb ; values for @xmath44 gpa are estimated using a procedure from ref . , as outlined below . where they can be compared , the present results are in reasonable agreement with earlier ac magnetic susceptibility measurements of jackson _ et al . _ to 6.3 gpa.@xcite the pressure dependence @xmath1 at higher pressures is seen to be highly non - monotonic , presumably in response to multiple structural phase transitions@xcite ( see top of the graph ) .",
    "note that the phase boundaries were determined from x - ray diffraction studies at ambient temperature and may shift somewhat as the temperature is lowered .    a comparison of @xmath1 for tb from fig",
    ". 4 to comparable graphs for gd and dy in ref . reveals a remarkable similarity to 53 gpa , the pressure at which the 5% volume collapse in tb occurs.@xcite also plotted in fig .",
    "4 are the values of @xmath40 for tb given by the upper error bars connected to the values of @xmath0 at each pressure by a light ( blue ) vertical line .",
    "particularly intriguing is the decrease in @xmath0 following the hr24 to body - centered monoclinic ( bcm ) transition at 53 gpa,@xcite followed by a rapid increase above 80 gpa .",
    "in contrast to the findings for @xmath45 gpa , at higher pressures @xmath1 for tb thus differs significantly from that found earlier for either gd or dy.@xcite plotted versus relative volume @xmath46 , the increase of @xmath0 above 80 gpa for tb is found to be much more rapid than the initial decrease of @xmath0 to 6.3 gpa .",
    "a similar result was found for dy.@xcite extrapolating @xmath47 versus @xmath48 for tb linearly to @xmath49 ( 141 gpa ) , yields the values @xmath50 250 k and @xmath51 k.    we now attempt a more quantitative estimate of the pressure dependence of @xmath52 , @xmath40 , and @xmath36 in the pressure range above @xmath53 gpa where the onset of the knee appears to lie at or above ambient temperature .",
    "we first consider the spin - disorder resistance @xmath54 at pressures @xmath55 gpa .",
    "the first step is to normalize @xmath54 to its value at 295 k , yielding the relative spin - disorder resistance @xmath56 plotted versus @xmath57 for data at 106 , 112 , and 116 gpa in fig .",
    "5 . since at the higher pressures of 120 , 126 , and 141 gpa",
    "the onset of magnetic ordering appears to lie above the temperature range of the present experiments ( 295 k ) , one can not determine the value of @xmath58 in the paramagnetic phase , nor @xmath0 or @xmath59 directly from the resistance data . however , noticing that over much of the temperature range the @xmath16 curves for 106 , 112 , and 116 gpa are approximately parallel on the @xmath57 plot in fig .",
    "5 , we divide the @xmath16 data for @xmath28 gpa by that factor which results in curves parallel to those at the lower pressures , as seen in fig . 5 .",
    "we identify this factor as the value of the temperature - independent spin - disorder resistance @xmath36 in the paramagnetic phase , as listed in table 1 .",
    "this procedure is tantamount to assuming that @xmath60 for @xmath61 gpa .",
    "the change in the value of the magnetic ordering temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath62 can now be estimated from the shift of the @xmath56 curves along the @xmath57 axis .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath1 and @xmath63 are given in table 1 and in fig .",
    "4 for all pressures in runs 1 and 2 as the open triangles and circles , respectively . from this analysis",
    "we infer that from 116 to 141 gpa the average magnetic ordering temperature @xmath0 has increased from 148 k to 203 k and the maximum ordering temperature @xmath62 from 249 k to 341 k , values close to those obtained in the linear extrapolation above .    in our previous work on dy the spin - disorder resistance in the paramagnetic state @xmath36",
    "was found to approximately track the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath0 as a function of pressure .",
    "this same result is seen in fig . 4 to hold for tb .",
    "we now seek to identify the mechanism(s ) responsible for the highly non - monotonic dependence of tb s magnetic ordering temperature @xmath0 on pressure .",
    "first we focus on the pressure region below @xmath64 gpa , the pressure at which tb suffers a 5% volume collapse .",
    "since the pressure dependence of @xmath47 is so similar for tb , gd and dy in this pressure range , a common mechanism seems likely .    for a conventional lanthanide metal with a stable magnetic moment",
    ", the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath47 is expected to scale with the de gennes factor @xmath65 , modulated by the prefactor @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the exchange interaction between the 4@xmath4 ion and the conduction electrons , @xmath68 the density of states at the fermi energy , @xmath69 the land-@xmath69 factor , and @xmath70 the total angular momentum quantum number.@xcite since the de gennes factor is constant under pressure , unless the magnetic state becomes unstable and/or a valence transition occurs , the marked similarity between the highly non - monotonic pressure dependences of @xmath0 for tb , dy and gd to 53 gpa likely originates in the pressure dependence of the prefactor @xmath71 , facilitated by a series of nearly identical structural phase transitions in tb,@xcite dy,@xcite and gd.gd,erran these phase transitions are likely driven by increasing 5__d__-electron occupation with pressure.@xcite indeed , electronic structure calculations for dy suggest that its large negative initial pressure derivative @xmath72 k / gpa results from a strong decrease in @xmath73.@xcite    .[table1 ] values for tb of the average @xmath37 and maximum @xmath40 magnetic ordering temperatures , spin - disorder resistance @xmath36 for @xmath74 , and phonon factor @xmath25 as a function of pressure from runs 1 and 2 ( see text ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now consider the pressure region @xmath75 53 gpa where the pressure dependence @xmath76 for tb is highly anomalous , deviating markedly from that of the model conventional lanthanide gd to at least 127 gpa.lim0 the absence of magnetic instabilities in gd , even at extreme pressures , is expected since the local magnetic state of gd with its half - filled 4@xmath77 shell is the most stable of all elements , its 4@xmath77 level lying @xmath78 ev below the fermi level.@xcite why is @xmath79 in tb anomalous for @xmath75 53 gpa ? a long - standing strategymatthias , maple2 to probe the magnetic state of a given ion is to alloy this ion in dilute concentration with a host superconductor and determine @xmath80 , the degree of suppression of the host s superconducting transition temperature . yttrium ( y ) is the ideal host superconductor for tb since the character of its @xmath81-electron conduction band closely matches that of the heavy lanthanides , y even exhibiting nearly the same sequence of structural transitions under pressure.@xcite one may thus anticipate that changes in the magnetic state of the tb ion in the dilute alloy will be mirrored in the changes occurring in the magnetic state of tb metal .",
    "the efficacy of this strategy is supported by previous studies of the pressure dependences @xmath82for dy metal and @xmath83 for y(dy ) where both experience a dramatic enhancement beginning just above the pressure of dy s volume collapse at @xmath84 gpa.@xcite it was argued that this anomalous behavior might be the result of the dy ion exhibiting kondo physics at elevated pressures where both @xmath0 and @xmath85 are proportional to @xmath86 , the square of the negative exchange parameter leading to the kondo effect .",
    "dy s volume collapse itself has been suggested to have its origin in the kondo volume collapse model of allen and martin.@xcite    does perhaps the same scenario apply for tb ? in fig .",
    "6 the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath87 of the dilute magnetic alloy y(0.5 at.% tb ) from our previous workfabbris1 is compared to that for elemental y metal.@xcite to a pressure of @xmath1150 gpa , @xmath88 for the dilute magnetic alloy is seen to increase with pressure at the same rate as for y. however , just above the pressure of tb s volume collapse at 53 gpa , the @xmath87 dependence for the alloy begins to pull away rapidly from that of y , reaching a maximum suppression @xmath89 5 k at 81 gpa , the highest pressure of the experiment . this strong suppression of y s superconductivity by dilute tb ions points to giant kondo pair breaking , as has previously been observed in high pressure studies on the dilute magnetic alloys la(ce),@xcite la(pr),@xcite y(pr),@xcite and , most recently , y(dy).@xcite in contrast , as seen in the inset to fig . 6 , @xmath87 for y(0.5 at.% gd ) does _ not _ begin to deviate markedly from that of y metal near @xmath90 gpa , where gd s volume collapse occurs , but rather faithfully tracks y s value of @xmath88 to 127 gpa , the maximum pressure of the experiment . unlike for tb , the magnetic state for gd ions in y remains stable to 127 gpa , so that no kondo phenomena are expected .",
    "we thus suggest that the anomalous pressure dependences @xmath91 and @xmath92 in tb and y(tb ) alloy , respectively , have their origin in kondo physics , as does tb s volume collapse itself . in support of these suggestions",
    "we point out that xanes and xes experiments on tb to extreme pressure reveal that neither a change in valence nor a magnetic local - itinerant transition occur to a pressure of @xmath93 gpa ,",
    "well above the volume collapse pressure for tb at 53 gpa.fabbris1    could perhaps an alternative explanation for the anomalously high magnetic ordering temperatures @xmath0 in tb be the effect of crystalline electric fields ? it has been argued that such fields are likely responsible for the significant enhancement of @xmath0 over de gennes scaling in a series of _ _ r__rh@xmath94b@xmath94 compounds , where _ _",

    "no crystal field effects are possible for gd since it carries no orbital moment ( @xmath99 ) . the lack of a sharp upturn or other anomalies in @xmath0 and @xmath100 in the pressure region 60 - 127 gpa would be consistent with the certain absence of crystal field effects in gd .",
    "the fact that the pressure dependence of @xmath0 is very similar for both gd and tb to 53 gpa indicates that crystal field effects in tb , if present , are only significant for pressures above 53 gpa where the @xmath1 dependence becomes anomalous . in a crystal field scenario , however , it would be difficult to understand the sharp upturn in the suppression of superconductivity @xmath85 in the dilute magnetic alloy y(0.5 at.% tb ) for pressures above 53 gpa .",
    "this strong suppression of superconductivity points rather to a kondo physics scenario with strong kondo pair breaking .",
    "further experimentation is necessary to unequivocally establish the origin of the anomalous behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath100 in tb and y(tb ) alloy , respectively , for the pressure region above 53 gpa .",
    "such experiments could include an extension of the pressure range to 2 mbar to search for the characteristic kondo sinkhole behavior  in @xmath87 observed for y(pr),@xcite la(ce),@xcite and la(pr)lapr where the @xmath88-suppression @xmath85 reaches a maximum as the kondo temperature @xmath101 passes through the experimental temperature range , but falls off again at higher pressures where @xmath101 far exceeds @xmath102 inelastic neutron or x - ray scattering studies to extreme pressures would help establish whether crystal - field splittings play a role in the anomalously high values of @xmath0  for tb .    in summary , measurements of the electrical resistivity of tb metal to extreme pressures reveal that the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath103 exhibits a highly non - monotonic pressure dependence , appearing to rise for @xmath75 80 gpa to anomalously high values .",
    "parallel experiments on gd and dilute magnetic alloys of gd and tb with y suggest that under extreme pressures tb is transformed from a magnetically conventional lanthanide into one with an unconventional magnetic state , perhaps involving kondo physics , with anomalously high values of @xmath0 .",
