    "an analogue of the @xmath13 system in the absence of cp ( or time - reversal ! ) violation is provided by two resonant circuits with equal natural frequencies and damping terms , coupled through a resistor , so that the long - lived oscillations will be those in which the two systems are in phase with one another and no energy is dissipated in the resistor",
    ". emulation of cp violation is harder .",
    "one may do so using asymmetric exchange of radiated energy between obliquely polarized antennas through a region in which faraday rotation is occurring .",
    "thus , for example , vlf ( very - low - frequency ) radio waves are subject to different attenuation when propagating in the ionosphere from east to west and from west to east @xcite . a more `` table - top '' version of such a phenomenon could utilize the hall effect .      in a parametrization @xcite in which the rows of the ckm matrix are labelled by @xmath14 and the columns by @xmath15",

    "the elements on and below the diagonal are determined by unitarity .",
    "the phase of @xmath18 is appreciable , while those of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are negligible for present purposes .",
    "these phases allow the standard @xmath21 interaction to generate cp violation as a higher - order weak effect .",
    "the four parameters are measured in the following manner @xcite :    \\(1 ) the parameter @xmath22 is measured by a comparison of strange particle decays with muon decay and nuclear beta decay , leading to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "\\(2 ) the dominant decays of @xmath1-flavored hadrons occur via the element @xmath25 .",

    "the unitarity of v and the fact that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are very close to 1 allow us to write @xmath32 , or , dividing by a common factor of @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the point @xmath35 thus describes in the complex plane one vertex of a triangle [ with angle @xmath36 in a conventional notation @xcite ] whose other two vertices are @xmath37 ( with angle @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( with angle @xmath40 ) .",

    "a large region centered about @xmath62 , @xmath63 is permitted .",
    "nonetheless , it could be that the cp violation seen in kaons is due to an entirely different source , perhaps a superweak mixing of @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite . in that case",
    "one could probably still accommodate @xmath66 ( see fig .  1 ) , and hence a real ckm matrix .",
    "in order to confirm the predicted nonzero value of @xmath42 , we turn to @xmath0 mesons for help .",
    "the error in the @xmath67 ckm element is dominated by theoretical uncertainty in extracting information from the measured @xmath0 lifetime and semileptonic branching ratio .",
    "even more theoretical uncertainty is associated in extraction of @xmath68 from a small portion of the semileptonic decay spectrum involving leptons beyond the endpoint for @xmath69 . in the long run a measurement of the branching ratio for @xmath70 or @xmath71 , though challenging , will be helpful in extracting the product @xmath72 .",

    "is lost , leading to an underestimate of the @xmath121 mass by about 46 mev but negligible energy smearing @xcite .",

    "the corresponding strange states might lie below @xmath141 threshold .",

    "it should be possible to calibrate the correlations between charged pions and neutral @xmath0 s by comparing them with the isospin - reflected correlations betwen charged pions and _ charged _ @xmath0 s ( whose flavor may be easier to identify ) .",
    "thus , the enhancement of the non - exotic @xmath157 channel with respect to the exotic @xmath158 channel should be the same as that of the non - exotic @xmath159 channel with respect to the exotic @xmath160 channel .",
    "what can spoil this relation ?",
    "i. dunietz and i @xcite have explored several instances in which care is warranted in making this comparison .",
    "some of the differences could be real , but there are many sources of potential instrumental error against which one has concrete remedies .",
    "interaction with the producing system _ can lead to final states which need not be invariant under isospin reflection .",
    "for example , although a pair of gluons would produce a @xmath161 pair with isospin @xmath162 , the fragmentation process could involve picking up quarks from the producing system ( e.g. , proton or antiproton fragments ) in a manner not invariant with respect to @xmath163 substitution .",
    "similarly , the production of a @xmath0 meson through diffractive dissociation of a proton ( which has more valence @xmath164 quarks than @xmath165 quarks ) need not be invariant under isospin reflection .",

    "pions in the decay of the associated @xmath0 _ will not be produced in an isospin - reflection - symmetric manner .",
    "one must be careful not to confuse them with primary pions .",
    "different time - dependent selection criteria _ for charged and neutral @xmath0 s can lead one to mis - estimate the mixing of neutral @xmath0 s with their antiparticles .",
    "( i thank p. derwent for pointing this out . )",
    "it is possible to make an unfortunate cut on @xmath47 lifetime which enhances the mixing considerably with respect to the value obtained by integrating over all times .",
    "overestimates of particle identification efficiencies _ can lead to confusion in identification of the flavor of a neutral @xmath0 through the decay @xmath168 .",
    "it is possible , especially for @xmath169 and @xmath144 with equal laboratory momenta , to confuse them with @xmath146 and @xmath149 , while still keeping them in a @xmath170 peak .",
    "the cdf collaboration at fermilab has been studying charged pion - @xmath0 correlations ever since the reports of ref .",
    "@xcite appeared , but no public announcement of these results has yet appeared .",
    "the intent of the present subsection is _ not _ to provide excuses for this failure to report results , but rather to provide ideas for ways to view the data in which such correlations are likely to be robust",
    ". they should certainly be present in hadron collider data .",
    "in this section we turn to decays of @xmath0 mesons to cp non - eigenstates .",
    "we have suggested @xcite that relations between decays of charged @xmath0 s to pairs of light pseudoscalar mesons based on flavor su(3 ) @xcite could provide information on weak phases by means of _ rate measurements alone_. the latest chapter in this story has been written since the workshop .",
    "two years ago the cleo collaboration @xcite presented evidence for a combination of @xmath172 and @xmath91 decays , generically known as @xmath173 . on the basis of 2.4 fb@xmath46 of data ,",
    "the most recent result @xcite is @xmath174 .",
    "although one still can not conclude that either decay mode is nonzero at the @xmath175 level , the most likely solution is roughly equal branching ratios ( i.e. , about @xmath176 ) for each mode .",
    "other results @xcite of the cleo collaboration on related modes include the upper bounds @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "interesting levels for the last two modes @xcite are probably around @xmath180 , and probably @xmath181 or less for @xmath182 . with good particle identification and a factor of several times more data",
    ", it appears that cleo will be able to make a systematic study of decay modes with two light pseudoscalars .",
    "what can it teach us ?",
    "we mentioned earlier that rate asymmetries in the decays @xmath183 and @xmath184 could provide information on the weak angle @xmath36 , as long as a single quark subprocess dominated the decay .",
    "additional contributions from penguin diagrams @xcite can be taken into account by means of an isospin triangle construction @xcite involving the relation @xmath185 , and the corresponding relation for the charge - conjugate processes . here",
    "we define amplitudes such that a partial width is always proportional to the square of an amplitude with the same coefficient .",
    "a similar amplitude quadrangle applies to the decays @xmath103 @xcite : @xmath186 .",
    "when combined with the corresponding relation for @xmath83 and @xmath187 decays , and used in conjunction with the time - dependence of the decays @xmath188 , these quadrangles are useful in extracting the weak phase @xmath36 .    in examining su(3 )",
    "relations among @xmath189 amplitudes , where @xmath190 is a pseudoscalar meson , we found that one of the diagonals of the amplitude quadrangle for @xmath103 ( corresponding to an amplitude with isospin @xmath191 ) could be related to the purely @xmath192 amplitude for @xmath193 .",
    "we obtained the relation @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",
    "the @xmath196 amplitude is expected to be dominated by a ( gluonic ) penguin contribution , involving mainly the combination of ckm elements @xmath197 , whose electroweak phase is @xmath198 .",
    "the electroweak phase of the @xmath199 amplitude is just @xmath200 .",
    "thus , in the absence of strong - interaction phase shift differences , the shape of the amplitude triangle would give @xmath38 .",
    "one could account for strong - interaction phases by comparing the amplitude triangle for @xmath143 decays with that for @xmath187 decays @xcite .",
    "we estimated @xcite that in order to measure @xmath38 to @xmath201 one would need a sample including about 100 events in the channels @xmath202 .",
    "the analyses of ref .",
    "@xcite assumed that the only penguin contributions to @xmath0 decays were gluonic in nature .",
    "consequently , one could treat the flavor - dependence in terms of an effective @xmath203 or @xmath204 transition since the gluon couples to light quarks in a flavor - symmetric manner .",
    "thus , the @xmath102 amplitude in @xmath103 ( the diagonal of the @xmath171 amplitude quadrangle mentioned above ) was due entirely to the cabibbo - suppressed `` tree - diagram '' process @xmath205 , whose weak phase was well - specified .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that in certain penguin - dominated @xmath0 decays such as @xmath206 , electroweak penguin amplitudes were large enough to compete favorably with the tree amplitude in the @xmath102 channel .",
    "in contrast to gluonic penguins , the virtual photon or @xmath207 emitted in an electroweak penguin diagram does not couple to light quarks in a flavor - symmetric manner , and possesses an @xmath208 component .",
    "specifically , if one decomposes amplitudes into isospin channels , @xmath209 @xmath210 deshpande and he @xcite find , in a specific calculation , that @xmath211 @xmath212 where the first term in each equation is the `` tree '' contribution ( of lowest order in electroweak interactions ) , while the second term is the penguin contribution .",
    "only the electroweak penguin contributes to the @xmath102 amplitude , but with magnitude comparable to the tree contribution .",
    "the electroweak penguin spoils the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tri ] ) .",
    "recently several of us re - examined the effects of su(3 ) breaking @xcite and electroweak penguins @xcite , to see if one could extract electroweak penguin effects _ directly from the data_. since our previous su(3 ) decomposition gave a complete set of reduced amplitudes , electroweak penguins only changed the interpretation of these amplitudes , so that a separation of electroweak penguin effects was not possible merely on the basis of su(3 ) .",
    "as pointed out by deshpande and he @xcite , certain amplitudes ( notably those for @xmath213 are expected to be dominated by electroweak penguins .",
    "we noted that the @xmath171 amplitude quadrangle could be written in such a manner that one if its diagonals was equal to @xmath214 , where @xmath215 denotes an unmixed octet member .",
    "the shape of the quadrangle , shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "is uniquely determined , up to possible discrete ambiguities .",
    "the case of octet - singlet mixtures in the @xmath42 requires us to replace the @xmath216 by the appropriate coefficient ; one can show that the su(3 ) singlet contribution of the @xmath42 is unimportant in this case .",
    "the quadrangle has been written in such a way as to illustrate the fact @xcite that the @xmath217 amplitude receives only penguin contributions in the absence of @xmath218 corrections .",
    "the weak phases of @xmath219 penguins , which are dominated by a top quark in the loop , are expected to be @xmath198 .",
    "we have oriented the quadrangle to subtract out the corresponding strong phase , and define corresponding strong phase shift differences @xmath220 with respect to the strong phase of the @xmath221 amplitude .",
    "the @xmath222 amplitude is composed of two parts , as noted above .",
    "we can rewrite it slightly as @xmath223 the corresponding charge - conjugate quadrangle has one diagonal equal to @xmath224 so that one can take the difference to eliminate the electroweak penguin contribution : @xmath225 the quantity @xmath226 can be related to the @xmath192 @xmath8 amplitude in order to obtain @xmath227 .",
    "specifically , if we neglect electroweak penguin effects in @xmath199 ( a good approximation ) , we find that latexmath:[\\[\\label{eqn : pipi }    thus , we can extract not only @xmath227 , but also a strong phase shift difference @xmath229 , by comparing eqs .",

    "remarkably , if @xmath240 gluonic penguin diagrams ( small in any case ) are approximately equal for the cases in which the spectator quark ends up in a vector meson and in a pseudoscalar [ see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ] , the previous quadrangle construction still holds if we replace @xmath241 with @xmath242 , @xmath243 with @xmath244 , and @xmath245 with @xmath246 .",
    "deshpande and he @xcite predict @xmath247 , which probably means that the quadrangle reduces to two nearly overlapping triangles ( whose shapes will consequently be difficult to specify ) . on the other hand , in @xmath235",
    "decays , the effects of electroweak penguins then may not be so important if the dominant processes are characterized by branching ratios of order @xmath176 as in @xmath189 decays .",
    "hints of some signals have been seen in some @xmath235 channels in the latest cleo data @xcite , but only upper limits are being quoted .",

    "in this section we comment on miscellaneous issues which deserve more attention if hadron collider experiments are to make a dent in the problem of cp violation in the @xmath0 meson system .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , if different minimum decay lengths are adopted for selection of different @xmath47 decay modes , the data sample will contain different admixtures of @xmath47 and @xmath83 in different decay modes .",
    "apparent inconsistencies can show up in charged pion ",
    "neutral @xmath0 correlations .",
    "a trigger based on the presence of secondary vertices may be the only way to pick out elusive decays such as @xmath253 in sufficent numbers for cp studies .      in the comparison of @xmath253 and @xmath103 decay modes",
    ", we have seen that good discrimination between pions and kaons is essential .",
    "some distinctive processes of @xmath0 production and decay involve large number of kaons .",
    "consider , for example the production of a @xmath254 with a kaon `` tag . ''",
    "if the subsequent decay is @xmath255 , a total of four kaons in the final state ( counting the `` tagging '' kaon ) must be identified .      in the production of a @xmath161 pair in high - energy @xmath3 collisions , as at lep ,",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath256 are separated from one another by many units of rapidity , with many hadrons filling the gap in between . in hadronic @xmath257 production",
    ", there may be a continuum of rapidity separations between @xmath1 and @xmath256 , ranging from the very small ( as in fragmentation of a hard gluon to @xmath161 ) to the very large ( as in back - to - back production of @xmath1 and @xmath256 jets ) .",
    "the `` same - side '' tagging method is likely to be more relevant for widely separated @xmath1 and @xmath256 .",
    "one must learn more about the hadrons which fill the gap between a @xmath1 and a @xmath256 in hadronic collisions , and tailor one s tagging methods accordingly .",
    "the most promising advantage for the study of @xmath0 physics at the tevatron ( and ultimately , at the lhc ) consists of the high rate of @xmath1 production .",
    "the relatively high @xmath161 effective mass expected in such processes implies that `` same - side '' tagging of neutral @xmath0 mesons in order to identify cp - violating rate asymmetries deserves serious study .",
    "a study of lifetime differences of hadrons containing @xmath1 quarks at an accuracy of several percent will permit the checking of detailed predictions of these differences .",
    "the innate advantage ( based on rate ) of the fermilab detectors for identification of tagged neutral @xmath0 mesons became clear several years ago when the first reconstructed @xmath0 mesons were presented by the cdf collaboration .",
    "however , `` same - side '' tagging results from cdf have been nearly two years in gestation",
    ". meanwhile , the recent identification of `` @xmath121 '' mesons at lep has brought to mind the last of satchel paige s six rules for staying young @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ do nt look back .",
