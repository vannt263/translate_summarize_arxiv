    "outflowing winds from accretion disks , accelerated by radiation force @xcite , magnetocentrifugal force @xcite , and/or thermal pressure @xcite , are a key evolutionary link between quasars and their host galaxies .",
    "the disk outflow plays an important role as 1 ) it extracts angular momentum from the accretion disk , leading to growth of black holes @xcite , 2 ) it provides energy and momentum feedback and inhibits star formation activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 3 ) it induces metal enrichment of intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "outflowing matter has been detected through blueshifted absorption lines in @xmath170%  of quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "these are usually classified as _",
    "intrinsic _ absorption lines , and distinguished from _ intervening _ absorption lines that originate in foreground galaxies or in the igm .",
    "thus , intrinsic absorption lines are powerful and unique tool to probe the outflows in quasars .",
    "however , the main challenge in their study is that these are traceable along _ only _ single sight - lines ( i.e. , a one dimensional view alone ) toward the nucleus for each quasar , whereas the absorber s physical conditions likely depend strongly on polar angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "multiple images of quasars produced by the gravitational lensing effect provide a unique pathway for studying the multiple sightlines , a technique frequently applied for intervening absorbers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that lensed quasars with larger image separation angles have more chance of detecting structural differences in the outflow winds in the vicinity of the quasars themselves . in this sense , the following three lensed quasars are the most promising site for our study as they are lensed by a cluster of galaxies rather than a single massive galaxy : sdss  j1004 + 4112 with separation angle of @xmath2 @xmath1 14@xmath3.6 @xcite , sdss  j1029 + 2623 with @xmath2 @xmath1 22@xmath3.5 @xcite , and sdss  j2222 + 2745 with @xmath2 @xmath1 15@xmath3.1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the differences in emission line profiles between the lensed images of sdss  j1004 + 4112 can be explained by differential absorptions along each sight - line although no absorption features are detected .",
    "there are clear absorption features detected at the blue wings of the , , and ly@xmath5  emission lines of other lensed quasar , sdss  j1029 + 2623 at  @xmath1 2.197 , the current record - holding large - separation quasar lens , in low / medium resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained high - resolution spectra of the brightest two images ( i.e. , images  a and b ) , and carefully deblended the and absorption lines into multiple narrower components .",
    "they show several clear signs supporting an origin in the outflowing wind rather than in foreground galaxies or the igm @xcite : i ) partial coverage , i.e. , the absorbers do not cover the background flux source completely along our sightline , ii ) line - locking , iii ) large velocity distribution ( fwhm @xmath61000  km / s ) , and iv ) a small ejection velocity from the quasar .",
    "@xcite also discovered a clear difference in parts of these lines between the images  a and b in all , , ly@xmath5  absorption lines , which can be explained by the following two scenarios : ( a ) intrinsic time variability of the absorption features over the time delay of the two images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( b ) a difference in the absorption levels between the different sight - lines of the outflowing wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a single epoch observation",
    ", we can not distinguish these scenarios .    in this letter , we present results from new spectroscopic observations of sdss  j1029 + 2623 conducted @xmath14 years later with the goal of conclusively determining the origin of the difference in the absorption features .",
    "we also examine the global and internal structure of the outflow .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in  2 , and results and discussion are in  3 and  4 .",
    "we observed the images  a and b of sdss  j1029 + 2623 with subaru / hds on 2014 april 4 ( the 2014 data , hereafter ) , 1514  days after the previous observation on february 2010 ( the 2010 data ; @xcite ) .",
    "the time interval between the observations is longer than the time delay between images  a and b , @xmath4 @xmath1 744  days in the sense of a leading b @xcite .",
    "we have taken high - resolution spectra ( @xmath0 @xmath1 36,000 ) with a slit width of @xmath7 , while @xcite took @xmath0 @xmath1 30,000 spectra using @xmath8 slit width .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 34004230   on the blue ccd and 42805100    on the red ccd , which covers ly@xmath5 , , , and absorption lines at  @xmath1 .",
    "we also sampled every 4 pixels in both spatial and dispersion directions ( i.e. , @xmath10.05  per pixel ) to increase s / n ratio .",
    "the total integration time is 11400  s and the final s / n ratio is about 14  pix@xmath9 for both of the images .",
    "we reduced the data in a standard manner with the software iraf .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using a th - ar lamp .",
    "we applied flux calibrations for quasar spectra using the spectrophotometric standard star feige34 .",
    "we did not adjust a spectral resolution of the 2014 spectra ( @xmath0 @xmath1 36,000 ) to the 2010 ones ( @xmath0 @xmath1 30,000 ) before comparing them , because a typical line width of each absorption component after deblending into multiple narrower components is large enough ( fwhm @xmath6 10  ; @xcite ) to ignore the influence of spectral resolution .",
    "here , we examine the time variability of ly@xmath5 , , and lines . although is also detected , we can not use it for the analysis because the line is severely contaminated by intervening and lines at lower redshift . for the purpose of comparing absorption profiles",
    ", we increase the s / n ratio by resampling the spectra every 0.5 . for a more quantitative test",
    ", we also compare the flux difference between the two spectra to 3@xmath10 flux uncertainty .    as shown in figure  [ f1 ] , we did not find any time variations either in ly@xmath5  or absorption lines .",
    "but lines in both of the images  a and b showed clear variation in its line _ strength _ by more than the 3@xmath10 level , without any change in line _",
    "profiles_.    in the 2010 spectra , @xcite discovered a clear difference in parts of , , and ly@xmath5  absorption lines at an ejection velocity of  @xmath1 0  200  between the images  a and b. the difference still remains at @xmath6 3@xmath10 level in the 2014 spectra , except for the absorption lines for which the difference between images  a and b is no longer significant ( figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "thus , absorption components at  @xmath1 0  200  ( shaded regions in figures  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) probably have a different origin from the other absorption components , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we call the former and the latter components as components 1 and 2 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , hereafter ) , respectively , and distinguish them in the discussion below .",
    "in this section , we discuss the difference between the images  a and b , the origin of the time variation seen in the lines between the 2010 and the 2014 data , and then the detectability of the sightline variation for quasar images with smaller separations , lensed by a single galaxy .",
    "@xcite presented two plausible scenarios that explain the sightline variation of the @xmath11 : ( a ) time variability over the time delay between the images , @xmath4 @xmath1 744  days , and ( b ) the difference in the absorption levels between two sightlines . with our new data",
    ", we can reject the first scenario because @xmath11 is again detected only in the image  a as in the 2010 data .",
    "if this is due to time variation , the @xmath11 has to decrease ( from the image  a to b in 2010 ) , increase ( from the image  b in 2010 to the image  a in 2014 ) , and then decrease again ( from the image  a to b in 2014 ) , which requires an unlikely fine - tuning . although sightline variations are often observed in intervening absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the @xmath11 in the image  a should have its origin in _ intrinsic _ absorber because it shows partial coverage @xcite and time variation ( this study ) .",
    "thus , the geometry of the outflow is such that the @xmath11 covers only sightline to the image  a , while the @xmath12 covers both sightlines of the images  a and b.    a possible structure of the outflow is shown in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "the @xmath11 absorber covers only the sightline toward image  a but not image  b , regardless of its distance ( @xmath13 ) from the flux source .",
    "the size of the absorbing cloud ( @xmath14 ) should be smaller than the size of the flux source ( because of partial coverage ) and also smaller than the physical distance between the sightlines of the lensed images , i.e. , @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 to avoid covering both sightlines .",
    "here , we assume the separation angle of the two sightlines from the flux source is very similar to that seen from us . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath12 has two possible origins : a ) small gas clouds close to the flux source and b ) filamentary ( or sheet - like ) structure made of multiple clumpy gas clouds @xcite . in either case , both sightlines a and b need to be covered .",
    "we will discuss these further in section 4.3 .",
    "time variability is frequently detected in broad absorption lines ( bals ) with line widths of @xmath6 2,000  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some narrower intrinsic absorption lines ( nals and mini - bals ) are also known to be variable ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are several explanations for the time variation , including gas motion across our line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , changes of the ionization condition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a variable scattering material that redirect photons around the gas clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these mechanisms are not applicable to intervening absorbers because they have larger sizes ( i.e. , gas motion and photon redirection do not work ) and lower densities ( i.e. , the variability time scale due to ion recombination is too long to observe over several years ) , compared to intrinsic absorbers as noted in @xcite .    in our monitoring campaign ,",
    "only absorption lines show clear time variation in both of the images .",
    "the absorption strength is seen to weaken over the entire wavelength range ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "this immediately rejects the gas motion scenario because all gas clouds that produce the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 need to cross our sightline in concert , which is highly unlikely .",
    "the scattering scenario is also difficult to accept because it can not explain the fact that only changes while and ly@xmath5  are stable .",
    "thus , we conclude that the change of ionization scenario is the most plausible explanation .",
    "the @xmath11 , arising in the absorber that locate only on the sightline  a , was monitored twice in 2010 and 2014 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath12 has two possibilities .",
    "if the corresponding absorber locates on both sightlines toward the images  a and b , we have monitored the variable lines in four epochs , i.e. , images  a and b in 2010 and then images  a and b in 2014 , with time intervals of @xmath1 744 , 770 , and 744  days , given the time delay of @xmath4 = 744  days between images  a and b. if the filamentary ( or sheet - like ) structure is the case , it means we have monitored them only twice as we did for the @xmath11 . in either case , we can not monitor the ionization condition of the absorbers because a wide range of ionic species ( which is necessary for photoionization modeling ) are not detected in our spectra .    here ,",
    "we discuss two possible scenarios for explaining the decrease of the line strength .",
    "first , the ionization level may have increased between the observations with more c@xmath17 ionized to c@xmath18 while the ionization fraction of n@xmath18 remained stable .",
    "if the absorber s ionization parameter is @xmath19 @xmath1 @xmath201.5 , at which point the ionization fraction of is close to peak @xcite , this scenario is possible .",
    "alternatively , the invariance of may be due to the saturation effect with partial coverage .",
    "another possible interpretation is recombination of c@xmath17 to c@xmath21 . in this case , we can place constraints on the electron density and the distance from the flux source by the same prescription as used in @xcite , assuming the variation time scale as the upper limit of the recombination time . if we monitored the absorbers twice ( i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the filamentary model ) or four times ( i.e. , @xmath12 in the single - sightline model ) , the electron density is estimated to be @xmath22 @xmath6 8.7@xmath2310@xmath24  or 1.72@xmath2310@xmath25  , and the distance from the flux source to be @xmath13 @xmath15 620  pc or 440  pc , respectively . because the absorber s distance is always smaller than the boundary distance ( see section 4.3 ) in both cases , the filamentary model can be rejected for the @xmath12 if recombination is the origin of the variation .",
    "whether we detect sightline difference or not depends on the absorber s size and its distance from the flux source . for placing constraints on the absorber s distance , the size estimation of the background flux source is very important .",
    "the outflow wind in sdss  j1029 + 2623 probably covers both the continuum source with a size of @xmath26 @xmath1 2.5@xmath2310@xmath27  pc and broad emission - line region ( belr ) with a size of @xmath28 @xmath1 0.09  pc because the residual flux at the bottom of the absorption lines are close to zero around the peak of the broad emission lines ( i.e. , covering factor toward belr is  @xmath1 1 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we define a boundary distance ( @xmath29 ) , a distance from the flux source where the physical distance between two sightlines ( @xmath30 ) is same as @xmath28 ( i.e. , the two sight - lines become fully separated with no overlap at @xmath13 @xmath31 @xmath29 ) .",
    "if the belr as well as the continuum source is the background source , the boundary distance is @xmath29 @xmath1788  pc .    here ,",
    "we present two possible scenarios for the origin of the @xmath11 .",
    "first , the @xmath11 absorber could locate at larger distance than the boundary distance , @xmath6788  pc . in this case",
    ", the @xmath11 absorber may be the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy that are swept up by an accretion disk wind @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario is that the absorber could be small clumpy cloud that locate at the outskirt of the @xmath12 absorber whose distance is smaller than the boundary distance .",
    "@xcite suggests that mini - bal absorbers consist of a number of small gas clouds ( @xmath14 @xmath15 10@xmath32 ",
    "10@xmath27  pc ) with very large gas density ( @xmath22 @xmath6 10@xmath33  10@xmath34 ) at the absorber s distance of @xmath13 @xmath1 2  pc to avoid over - ionization . a similar picture",
    "is also suggested for bal quasars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent radiation - mhd simulations by @xcite reproduce variable clumpy structures with typical sizes of @xmath1 20  @xmath35 in warm absorbers , corresponding to @xmath1 5@xmath2310@xmath27  pc assuming the black - hole mass of sdss  j1029 + 2623 , m@xmath36 @xmath1 10@xmath37 m@xmath38 . indeed , high - velocity intrinsic nals are frequently detected with partial coverage toward the continuum source only , suggesting their typical size is comparable to or smaller than the continuum source @xcite .",
    "our results have broader implications as well .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] summarizes physical distance between lensed images as a function of separation angle for the 124 lensed quasars discovered to date , assuming the absorber s distance is 1  pc , 10  pc , 100  pc , and 1  kpc .",
    "the sightline difference will be detected for quasars lensed by a single galaxy whose typical separation angle is @xmath2 @xmath1 2@xmath39 , if the absorber s size is smaller than its distance from the flux source by more than five orders of magnitude ( i.e. , @xmath40 @xmath15 @xmath2 ) .",
    "this would place an important constraint on the absorbers .",

    "<S> we also discovered time variation of absorption strength in both images  a and b , due to change of ionization condition . if a typical absorber s size is smaller than its distance from the flux source by more than five orders of magnitude , it should be possible to detect sightline variations among images of other smaller separation , galaxy - scale gravitationally lensed quasars . </S>"
