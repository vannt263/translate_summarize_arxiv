    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semi - detached interacting binary stars composed of a white dwarf ( wd ) primary star and a low mass ( @xmath8m@xmath9 ) main sequence secondary star , with typical orbital periods of @xmath10 d. the roche - lobe - filling secondary star loses mass through the inner lagrangian point into an accretion disk formed around the wd ( for non - magnetic cvs ) .",
    "classical novae are a subclass of cv in which a thermonuclear runaway is triggered in a reservoir of matter that has been gradually accreted onto the wd .",
    "the resultant outburst produces a peak brightness increase of @xmath11 615 mag , and releases @xmath12 erg ( see review in * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  5 )",
    ".    the outbursts of novae are often well - observed , and the long term behavior of many dwarf novae and novalike cvs is monitored by the american association of variable star observers .",
    "however , there have been few programs for monitoring the variability of novae at quiescence .",
    "one such program , using an automated telescope called roboscope ( see  [ s - robo ] ) , has monitored 22 old novae and 42 novalikes , most of them for over 9 years now .",
    "roboscope has found several kinds of unusual photometric behavior .",
    "about one - third of the old novae have shown quasi - periodic variability for a year or two , interspersed with stable light curves .",
    "these variations do not appear stochastic as they repeat at similar periods when they reappear .",
    "preliminary analysis of roboscope light curves spanning several years for the old nova di lacertae suggested brightness oscillations on a time scale of @xmath13 d @xcite , while the old nova v841 ophiuchi also displayed prominent variability @xcite . in order to determine",
    "if these oscillations could be related to a disk instability mechanism ( as operates in dwarf novae ) or to mass transfer or magnetic effects on the secondary star , we attempted a detailed study of di lac and v841 oph , which are among the most active and brightest of the systems showing the oscillations .",
    "di lac (= nova lac 1910 ) was a moderately fast nova that reached a maximum brightness of @xmath14 mag during its outburst .",
    "v841 oph (= nova oph 1848 ) was a slow nova that reached a similar brightness , @xmath15 mag @xcite .",
    "the reddening for both objects has been measured from _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( @xmath16 ) ultraviolet and ground - based optical spectra .",
    "the range for di lac is @xmath170.41 @xcite , while for v841 oph it is @xmath180.58 @xcite .",
    "nova shells were not detected in h@xmath19 for either cv @xcite . in x - rays , di lac was undetected in the @xmath20 pspc all sky survey , with a @xmath21 upper limit of 0.013 cts s@xmath4 in the 11201 channel ( 0.12.0 kev ) energy range during 299 s total exposure time , while v841 oph was a marginal detection with @xmath22 cts s@xmath4 in the `` hard '' 0.92.0 kev _ rosat _ energy range ( @xmath23 cts s@xmath4 in the full _ rosat _ energy range ) during 402 s total exposure time @xcite .",
    "we report here on the results of ground - based optical photometry and spectroscopy , and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( @xmath24 ) x - ray observations of di lac and v841 oph .",
    "the optical photometry comprises an almost decade - long light curve for each star , while the contemporaneous spectroscopy and x - ray observation repeatedly sampled each nova during separate intervals of @xmath055 d in length .",
    "our long - term optical photometry of di lac and v841 oph was accomplished from 19901998 , while the spectroscopic amd x - ray observations took place in 1997 .",
    "these observations are summarized in tables  [ t - di_log ] and [ t - v8_log ] , and are discussed in detail below .",
    "our optical photometry data were acquired by roboscope , a 41-cm telescope in indiana equipped for automated differential ccd stellar photometry @xcite .",
    "all observatory operations ( including data reductions ) are accomplished as fully unattended and unsupervised tasks , which makes practical the acquisition of long homogeneous data streams .",
    "typically , roboscope obtains one or two 4-min exposures per clear night for each of @xmath25 program stars .",
    "the data are reduced using the method of incomplete ensemble photometry @xcite . for di lac ,",
    "85 ensemble stars were used in 987 exposures over 9 observing seasons from 1990 november to 1998 november . for v841 oph ,",
    "24 ensemble stars were used in 611 exposures over 8 observing seasons from 1991 may to 1998 september .",
    "the zero - points of the differential light curves were established using secondary standard stars from @xcite .",
    "six such secondary standards were used for v841 oph , while 13 were employed for di lac .",
    "typical @xmath26 uncertainties in the calibrated magnitudes are on the order of 0.010.05 mag . over the entire multiyear range of the roboscope light curves ,",
    "the mean magnitudes were @xmath27 for di lac and @xmath28 for v841 oph , with full ranges of variability of @xmath29 mag and @xmath30 mag , respectively .",
    "the roboscope light curves of di lac and v841 oph are shown in figures [ f - di_lc ] and [ f - v8_lc ] .    with only limited excursions to anomalously fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the typical minimum magnitude of @xmath31 for di lac has a sharp boundary at any given epoch .",
    "however , the minimum brightness displays a slight , apparently linear , trend towards increasing brightness over the 8 years of roboscope observation . if we ignore for the moment the small number of data points that fall below the well - defined low brightness limit seen in the top panel of figure [ f - di_lc ] , then the typical minimum brightness of di lac changes from @xmath32 mag at the beginning of the roboscope coverage , to @xmath33 mag at the end .",
    "this corresponds to a mean increase of the minimum brightness by @xmath34 mag yr@xmath4 .",
    "the maximum brightness of di lac is much less uniform , and it is difficult to determine if the maximum brightness behaves in the same manner as the minimum brightness .",
    "a linear fit to the complete di lac light curve ( with each data point weighted by the inverse square of its @xmath26 uncertainty ) gives the rate of change of the mean magnitude as @xmath35 mag yr@xmath4 ; that is , the mean brightness of di lac is essentially constant .",
    "however , if we exclude the 2 excursions to fainter magnitudes at hjd 2450600 and hjd 2451000 ( as well as the excursion to brighter magnitudes at hjd 2450300 ) , then the slope of the linear fit changes to @xmath36 mag yr@xmath4 ; that is , a trend towards increasing mean brightness .",
    "the faint magnitude excursions in the light curve of di lac are very similar to the `` dips '' seen by @xcite in long - term roboscope light curves of five old novae and novalike cvs . in the latter systems ,",
    "the dips were found to often be paired with a preceding or following outburst , although the dips also sometimes occurred as isolated events .",
    "@xcite do not find a clear mechanism ( e.g.  disk instabilities , truncated disks , mass transfer modulation ) that is responsible for the dips , but conclude that the overall photometric behavior ( dips and outbursts ) of the novae and novalikes that they studied is likely to be governed by either a combination of disk and mass transfer events , or by mass transfer events alone .",
    "in contrast to the linear trend in the minimum brightness of di lac , the minimum brightness of v841 oph appears to follow an almost sinusoidal trend that completes approximately 1.52 cycles during the 7.5 year roboscope coverage .",
    "as seen in the top panel of figure [ f - v8_lc ] , the minimum brightness of v841 oph varies from @xmath37 mag to @xmath38 mag .",
    "the maximum brightness of v841 oph , which ranges from @xmath39 mag to @xmath40 mag , displays the same behavior ; that is , when the minimum brightness at a given epoch is at its faint ( bright ) level , the maximum brightness is also at its faint ( bright ) level .",
    "we note that the magnitude range spanned by the minimum brightness in v841 oph is about twice as large as that spanned by the maximum brightness .",
    "although a linear fit to this overall trend is perhaps not the optimum choice , the corresponding rate of mean magnitude change is @xmath41 mag yr@xmath4 .",
    "it is possible ( but not required by the data ! ) that the apparently linear trend in the light curve of di lac may also be a sinusoid , but with a much longer cycle length than in v841 oph .",
    "we searched for periodicities in the range 10100 days in the roboscope light curve data in two ways : by applying the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) algorithm @xcite , as well as performing an independent power spectrum analysis using the clean algorithm @xcite .",
    "we performed the period search on both the entire data set for each cv , as well as on the data subsets from individual observing seasons ( indicated in figures [ f - di_lc ] and [ f - v8_lc ] ) .",
    "the most prominent period detected in each data set is listed in table [ t - periods ] ( in several cases , most notably for the combined data sets for each nova , two significant periods are listed ) . in general , the two period search methods gave equivalent results to within better than 14 days .",
    "all of the detected time scales appear to correspond to quasiperiodic behavior rather than truly periodic variability such as that resulting from , for example , an eclipsing orbit .",
    "the time scales have significant `` flexibility '' ( on the order of 15 days for periods @xmath42 d , 520 days for periods @xmath43 d ) over the multi - year length of the light curves ( as shown by substantially broadened dips and peaks in the pdm and clean analyses , respectively ) .",
    "phase - binned light curves of both cvs folded on the shorter period found for each combined data set are shown in figure [ f - folded_lc ] .",
    "we note that the true amplitude of variation in a given cycle or observing season will be larger than the 0.10.2 mag suggested by figure [ f - folded_lc ] , in which data from many cycles with slightly different amplitudes and periods have been averaged together .",
    "inspection of figures [ f - di_lc ] and [ f - v8_lc ] shows amplitudes of 0.40.8 mag for the full range of variability within each observing season . the long - term sinusoidal trend in the light curve of v841 oph is also well - fit by a periodicity in the range 18001900 d or , with slightly less agreement , 12501300 d. ( we note that these two period ranges are approximately related by the ratio 3:2 , so we are likely seeing an aliasing effect due to the fact that only 1.52 cycles of these long periods are contained in the light curves . )      we obtained optical spectra of both cvs using the double imaging spectrograph on the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5-m telescope @xcite during university of washington share time .",
    "spectra of di lac were obtained in july and august of 1997 ; spectra of v841 oph were obtained in may of 1997 .",
    "the apo spectra have a resolution of @xmath44  and cover simultaneous wavelength ranges of @xmath455000  and @xmath466800 .",
    "the raw spectrum images were reduced in the standard fashion using iraf .",
    "the instrumental response was removed via spectra of standard stars @xcite obtained on the same nights ; however , slit losses due to guiding errors rendered the absolute flux calibration unreliable .",
    "consequently , we have normalized the spectra to a constant continuum level of 1.0 .",
    "a representative spectrum of di lac is shown in figure [ f - di_spec ] .",
    "note the prominent balmer absorption troughs containing narrow , central emission cores .",
    "our other two apo spectra of di lac ( not shown ) are essentially identical to this one , with the exception that the balmer emission cores in the august spectrum are somewhat stronger ( relative to ) than in the july spectra .",
    "the @xmath47 feature ( see inset ) is present with the same profile shape in all three of our spectra .",
    "it is suggestive of the absorption trough with central emission as seen in the balmer lines .",
    "the feature labeled with `` ? '' is likely an instrumental or reduction artifact since its wavelength does not match any identifiable line and it occurs in _ all _ of our apo spectra ( those of v841 oph included ) .",
    "additional optical spectra of both novae were obtained using the hydra multi - fiber positioner + bench spectrograph @xcite on the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "spectra of di lac were obtained in 1997 september , and spectra of v841 oph were obtained in 1997 may .",
    "the wiyn spectra have a resolution of @xmath48  and cover ( usable ) wavelength ranges of @xmath496800  for di lac and @xmath505000   for v841 oph . for the wiyn spectra of di lac ,",
    "no standard star observations were available , so it was not possible to correct for the instrumental response or perform a flux calibration .",
    "we do not show these spectra here , but note that they are qualitatively similar to the red apo spectrum shown in figure [ f - di_spec ]  no differences corresponding to the different brightness levels in the roboscope light curve are apparent .",
    "the v841 oph wiyn data were reduced and calibrated as with the apo spectra . again , slit losses and , additionally , the presence of cirrus made the absolute flux calibration unreliable , so we have normalized the spectra to a constant continuum level of 1.0 .",
    "all of the spectra of v841 oph are shown in figure [ f - v8_spec ] ( the three wiyn spectra have been averaged together to improve the s / n ) .    there is no indication of the absorption troughs seen in the spectra of di lac .",
    "additionally , the / + emission complex appears to be stronger , with broader lines , in v841 oph than in di lac .",
    "flux - calibrated optical spectra of both di lac and v841 oph are shown in @xcite , with resolutions of 5.1  and 6.7 , respectively , and in @xcite , with resolution of 1520  for both .",
    "@xcite obtained his spectra in 1981 , while @xcite obtained theirs in 1990 . in both papers , the spectra of both novae show steep blue continua ; the observed continuum of di lac is bluer than that of v841 oph ( but different reddening values could eliminate or reverse this characteristic ) .",
    "@xcite fit a power law of the form @xmath51 to the continuum regions 56006500  and 66508000  in their spectra .",
    "these fits yielded indices of @xmath52  dereddened to @xmath53 using @xmath54  for di lac and @xmath55  dereddened to @xmath56 using @xmath57  for v841 oph .",
    "@xcite performed this power law fit to the wavelength region 12003200  in @xmath16 uv spectra of di lac and v841 oph .",
    "using reddenings at the low ends of the ranges given in  [ s - intro ] , @xmath17 for di lac and @xmath18 for v841 oph , they calculated dereddened slopes of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "comparison with the slope expected for the continuum flux distribution of a steady - state accretion disk composed of parcels radiating as blackbodies , @xmath60 @xcite , suggests that the true reddening values for di lac and v841 oph are near the middle of the ranges given in  [ s - intro ] .    in 1936 , both of these novae",
    "were observed spectroscopically by @xcite , who noted their strong blue continua , but also noted the absence of _ any _ lines , emission or absorption . since that time ,",
    "the available published spectra of di lac and v841 oph in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are consistent with our current spectra ( see spectroscopic histories summarized in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the exception that @xcite did not report the detection of any @xmath61 emission in either star .",
    "di lac and v841 oph were each observed ten times during july  september and april  june of 1997 , respectively , with the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the @xmath24 satellite ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the pca consists of five xenon - methane proportional counters effective over the range 260 kev ( with 18% energy resolution at 6 kev ) .",
    "each @xmath24 visit constituted a good - time - interval on - source lasting @xmath622500 s. we extracted the net average x - ray count rate from each visit and the x - ray spectrum from the ten combined visits to each star using the ftools / lheasoft ( v5.0 ) software package .",
    "we utilized the faint source background models ( pca_bkgd_faintl7_e3v19990824.mdl and pca_bkgd_faint240_e3v19990909.mdl ) and an up - to - date south atlantic anomaly history file ( pca_saa_history_20000223 ) .",
    "extraction of the count rates and spectra was carried out as described in `` the rxte cookbook '' .",
    "the x - ray light curves constructed from the mean count rates at each visit for di lac and v841 oph are shown in figures [ f - di_xray ] and [ f - v8_xray ] , respectively , along with the corresponding sections of their roboscope @xmath63 band light curves .",
    "the light curve counts were summed in the energy range 015 kev .",
    "inspection of the x - ray spectra ( see below ) revealed an essentially zero count rate dominated by noise at energies higher than 15 kev .",
    "the mean x - ray count rates averaged over all ten visits to each target are @xmath64 ct s@xmath4 for di lac and @xmath65 ct s@xmath4 for v841 oph . considering these very low count rates , it is not clear whether or not the variability seen in the x - ray light curves is real .",
    "additional analysis and model - fitting ( di lac only ) of the x - ray spectra of these novae was performed using the routine xspec ( v11 ) .",
    "although we extracted the full range of available energy channels in the x - ray spectra , only the range 015 kev was used for fitting the models to the di lac data .",
    "the x - ray spectra for di lac and v841 oph are shown in figures [ f - di_modspec ] and [ f - v8_xspec ] .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of v841 oph is shown on the same scale as that of di lac ; the former is clearly much weaker than the latter .",
    "we attempted to extract a better spectrum of v841 oph by using only the data from the four visits with the largest count rates ( visits 3 , 5 , 9 , and 11  see table [ t - v8_log ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this spectrum was virtually identical to the total combined spectrum ( i.e.  flat and featureless ) , with the exception of a small upward offset of the mean count rate , from about 0.02 cts s@xmath4 kev@xmath4 in the total combined spectrum to about 0.04 cts s@xmath4 kev@xmath4 in the `` high '' count rate spectrum .",
    "consequently , no attempt was made to fit a model to the spectrum of v841 oph .    for di lac",
    ", we fit three simple models to the x - ray spectrum : ( 1 ) blackbody , ( 2 ) raymond - smith thermal plasma , and ( 3 ) bremsstrahlung .",
    "each model was modified by a multiplicative component representing photoelectric ( h column ) absorption .",
    "more complex models were not warranted owing to the small number of counts per energy channel in the data . in all cases ,",
    "the data were weighted using the xspec - recommended scheme appropriate for small count numbers , @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the results of these model fits are summarized in the first three rows of table [ t - di_model ] .",
    "all of the models produce nearly indistinguishable fits to the observed spectrum .",
    "the bremsstrahlung model is formally the best - fitting ( with lowest reduced @xmath67 and highest null hypothesis probability ) and is plotted over the observed spectrum in figure [ f - di_modspec ] .",
    "all of the models were only able to constrain the hydrogen column density to an upper limit ; the values of @xmath68 quoted in the first three rows of table [ t - di_model ] are the upper ends of the 1-parameter 90% confidence intervals .",
    "we used the relation @xmath69 @xcite to estimate values of @xmath68 spanning the reddening range given in ",
    "[ s - intro ] .",
    "we then re - fit the models to the x - ray spectrum of di lac with only two free parameters :  temperature and normalization .",
    "the results are listed in the bottom six rows of table [ t - di_model ] . while slightly different from those obtained from the original model fits , they are completely consistent with them . the bremsstrahlung model yields a slightly lower nominal temperature of @xmath704.2 kev ( vs.  @xmath71 kev when @xmath68 is a free parameter ) and is still the best - fitting model for both values of @xmath68 .",
    "we note that the uncertainties quoted in table [ t - di_model ] for @xmath72 and @xmath73 are 1-parameter 90% confidence intervals ; the interdependent parameter uncertainties will be slightly different .",
    "for example , for the bremsstrahlung model ( with free @xmath68 ) , the xspec routine steppar contours . ] gives a 2-parameter 90% confidence interval of @xmath74 for @xmath72 with respect to @xmath68 , and @xmath75 for @xmath72 with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "the x - ray count rates were too low to reliably fit spectrum models to any of the ten individual @xmath24 visits to di lac .",
    "we constructed `` low '' and `` high '' state x - ray spectra by combining the data from visits with the lowest mean count rates ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 ) and from visits with the highest mean count rates ( 5 , 6 , 9 ) to see if there were any differences between the low and high x - ray brightness states .",
    "other than an @xmath48 cts s@xmath4 kev@xmath4 increase at the peak energy of the high state spectrum , the two spectra are essentially indistinguishable from each other ( and from the combined spectrum from all ten visits ) .",
    "we conclude from this that either the spectral energy distribution of the x - ray emitting source in di lac does not change as the overall brightness of the x - ray source changes , or that the variability seen in the x - ray light curve of di lac is not real ( i.e. it is a side - effect of the very low count rates ) .",
    "inspection of the roboscope light curves of di lac and v841 oph reveals variability on three distinct time scales .",
    "first , in the range 10100 d , quasiperiods with typical lengths of @xmath150 d are present in each of these cvs . yet",
    ", the presence ( or lack ) of periodic and/or quasiperiodic variability on time scales up to a few hundred days in v841 oph has been contested in the literature .",
    "( to the best of our knowledge , no extensive database of photometric observations of di lac has been published prior to this work . )",
    "using 420 archival visual observations of v841 oph spanning 28 yr , @xcite quote an average period of 51.5 d with individual cycles ranging from 45 d to 57 d. @xcite observed v841 oph once per night for 31 nights during a 45 night interval in 1986 using a ccd camera + @xmath76 filter , and found a period of @xmath77 d. all of these values are comparable to the @xmath7850 d we found for our complete roboscope light curve of v841 oph , as well as to the range of periods found for individual observing seasons in the roboscope data ( see table [ t - periods ] ) . on the other hand , @xcite notes the presence of considerable variability in archival light curves of v841 oph ( including some of the same data used by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but finds no evidence for periodicities up to 200 d.    it is quite interesting that the variability time scales in these two novae are similar to those that characterize dwarf nova outbursts ( * ? ? ?",

    "old novae are presumed to have mass transfer rates , @xmath79 , above the threshold level ( @xmath80 ) at which the accretion disk thermal instability mechanism operates in dwarf novae to produce their outbursts @xcite .",
    "however , the hibernation theory of cyclic evolution between cv variability types ( * ? ? ?",

    "the amplitudes of variability displayed by di lac and v841 oph ( see figures [ f - di_lc ] and [ f - v8_lc ] ) are smaller than those typically observed for dwarf novae ( @xmath81 24 mag ) , but we can not rule out the possibility of a disk instability mechanism being in operation  after all , it has been 90 years since the nova outburst of di lac and over 150 years since that of v841 oph .",

    "second , v841 oph displays a distinct sinusoidal variation with a best period of 18001900 d ( 4.95.2 yr ) or a slightly less preferred period of 12501300 d ( 3.43.6 yr ) . di lac does not appear to display similar sinusoidal variability , unless it occurs with a much longer period than in v841 oph .",

    "@xcite re - analyzed the light curves presented by @xcite and consider the case for a multi - year periodicity in v841 oph to be very weak .",
    "however , with our roboscope light curve , sinusoidal variability on comparable multi - year times scales has now been observed in two separate data sets for v841 oph spanning almost 80 years of observation . while this still does not provide firm evidence of strictly periodic behavior , it certainly points to the presence of a mechanism operating in this cv that modulates its brightness on a characteristic time scale of several years .",
    "photometric variability in old novae on time scales of several years has generally been attributed to solar - type magnetic cycles on the secondary star that might be able to control the rate of mass loss through the inner lagrangian point @xcite .",
    "although @xcite find that no cv studied to date displays strictly periodic behavior over multi - year intervals , they also note that the observed amplitudes ( @xmath87 mag ) and `` apparent '' time scales of variability of 540 yr are `` plausible consequences from solar - type magnetic cycles .

    "we note that the shorter time scale ( @xmath883050 d ) variability discussed above might also be linked to modulation of @xmath79 due to secondary star magnetic activity .",

    "sparse photoelectric and ccd data from 1953 to 1981 suggest a possible small brightness increase , which is supported by our recent roboscope observations . for v841",
    "oph , visual observations from 191952 and 197891 yield a brightness decline of @xmath91 mmag yr@xmath4 , while `` no definitive brightness decline '' @xcite was found in photoelectric data from 1954 to 1988 .",
    "our post-1991 observations of v841 oph suggest a trend towards decreasing mean brightness comparable to that noted by @xcite in the archival visual observations , although the obvious sinusoidal variation that dominates our light curve at long time scales makes this conclusion somewhat suspect .    in the `` classical '' hibernation scenario @xcite ,",
    "novae stay bright for @xmath88 50300 yr following outburst , gradually declining in brightness during this time to a hibernating state characterized by low brightness ( @xmath92 or fainter ) and low mass accretion rate ( @xmath93 m@xmath9 yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "however , the photometric record of di lac from the 1920 s ( a decade after its outburst ) to the 1990 s does not show a simple decline in brightness . instead , the brightness of di lac decreased for about four decades after outburst , but then apparently leveled off for several decades . in the last decade ( covered in our roboscope light curve ) , the brightness of di lac has been increasing .",
    "it is possible that we are seeing the influence of a mechanism ( such as magnetic activity of the secondary star ",
    "see above  and/or accretion - induced irradiation of the secondary star ) that modulates @xmath79 ( and , hence , the brightness ) in di lac over a long - term cycle ( with period on the order of many decades ) that obscures the general decline predicted by the hibernation scenario .",
    "the optical spectra of di lac and v841 oph are quite different , and this can possibly be ascribed to their difference in post - outburst ages .",
    "the spectrum of v841 oph is similar to those of novalike cvs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "4 )  this suggests that v841 oph still has a high accretion rate , even @xmath94 yr after outburst .",
    "the narrow emission components in di lac are suggestive of emission originating from the irradiated inner face of the secondary star , while the absorption troughs imply the presence of optically thick material in the system",
    ". the latter feature could be material ejected during the outburst of this younger post - nova ; the lack of any detected h@xmath19 emission shell @xcite does not preclude the existence of denser , non - emitting circumstellar material .",
    "the former feature offers a possible explanation for the gradual brightness increase seen in our roboscope light curve of di lac ( discussed in  [ s - optvar ] ) if the secondary star is being slowly heated via irradiation and is , in turn , increasing the rate of mass transfer through the @xmath89 point .",
    "although the roboscope coverage is incomplete , we infer from the adjacent data that di lac was faint during our july spectra and bright during our august spectrum ( see figure [ f - di_xray ] ) . as mentioned in ",
    "[ s - optspec ] , the only difference between our july and august spectra is that the emission cores were somewhat stronger in august ( bright state ) than july ( faint state ) .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that these narrow emission features originate on the irradiated face of the secondary star if we make the logical assumption that the irradiation increases when di lac is bright . it does not , however , illuminate the exact mechanism producing the irradiation ( i.e.  whether the `` excess '' flux in the high state originates near the disk center  presumably due to a disk instability producing increased accretion onto the wd  or in the outer disk  presumably due to an increase in mass transfer through the @xmath89 point . )",
    "if we assume that the spectrum shown in figure [ f - di_spec ] ( from july 27 09:01:47 ut ) was obtained at an arbitrary orbital phase of 0.0 , then the august 17 spectrum was obtained at a relative orbital phase of 0.9 ( using @xmath95 d ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , these two spectra were obtained at similar orbital phases , and we do not expect the difference in the narrow emission component strength to be only due to system orientation .    the roboscope coverage of v841 oph during our spectroscopic ( and x - ray ) observations is more sparse than for di lac , but we can infer that the cv was returning to the faint state during our may 07 spectrum , was in its faint state during our may 14 and 17 spectra , and was likely near the bright state during our may 27 spectrum ( see figure [ f - v8_xray ] ) .",
    "( the two elevated brightness points at hjd 2450610 and hjd 2450625 suggest that v841 oph may have returned to a bright state sometime between the low states bracketing hjd 2450590 and hjd 2450630 . )",
    "if this is the case , then the somewhat stronger h@xmath19 emission of the may 07 and may 27 spectra ( see figure [ f - v8_spec ] ) may be linked to the bright state of the cv . as with di lac",
    ", we calculated relative orbital phases for each of these spectra ( using @xmath96 d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and obtained @xmath97 for may 07 , 14 , 17 , 27 , respectively . unfortunately , this casts some doubt on the link between h@xmath19 emission strength and brightness state , since both of the bright state spectra ( phases 0.0 , 0.1 ) were obtained at different orbital phases than the faint state spectra ( phases 0.6 , 0.75 ) .",
    "so , we can not rule out the influence of system orientation effects in these spectra .",
    "unfortunately , because of the weak x - ray emission from these cvs , little can be firmly stated about their x - ray variability .",
    "the count rates during visits 5 and 6 to di lac , which took place when we infer from the roboscope light curve that the cv was in a bright state , are slightly elevated compared to the preceding visits .",
    "however , visit 7 also occurred during this optical bright state and does not show an elevated count rate .",
    "the mean x - ray count rate during each visit to v841 oph also does not display any strong correlation with the corresponding optical state .",
    "the lack of large changes in x - ray flux or spectrum during the optical variations ( as usually evident in dwarf novae ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , argues against a disk instability scenario .",
    "alternatively , this could indicate that the optical brightness is determined by activity in the outer disk only and , therefore , is not reflected in the x - ray behavior ; however , the x - ray count rates are too low ( and their corresponding error bars too large ) to make any firm conclusions .",
    "our long - term optical light curves of the novae di lac and v841 oph obtained with roboscope reveal quasiperiodic variability with a characteristic time scale of @xmath150 d in both cvs .",
    "in addition , the light curve of v841 oph displays evidence for sinusoidal variability with a period of 3.55 yr . the latter can not be said to be strictly periodic since our data set covers only @xmath98 cycles ; however , when this detection is added to past reports of multi - year periodicities in v841 oph that have been reported in the literature , a strong case can be made for the presence of repeating multi - year variability with a preferred time scale in this cv .",
    "the most likely origin of such behavior is a solar - type magnetic cycle of the secondary star that modulates the rate of mass transfer through the @xmath89 point .",
    "if this is the case , then the shorter @xmath150 d quasiperiodic variability in this system might also be related to the magnetic activity on the secondary star ; for example , due to starspots that migrate under the @xmath89 point and temporarily throttle mass transfer .",
    "di lac does not show evidence for cyclic multi - year variability , unless it occurs with a much longer period than the length of our roboscope coverage ( @xmath84 yr ) .",
    "this casts some doubt on the origin of the @xmath150 d quasiperiodic variability as a facet of the secondary star s magnetic activity , since both v841 oph and di lac show the @xmath150 d quasiperiodic behavior , but only v841 oph displays evidence for a multi - year solar - type magnetic cycle on the secondary star . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath150 d time scale is very reminiscent of that expected for dwarf nova type behavior ( although the amplitude of variability in these novae is smaller than in typical dwarf nova outbursts ) .",
    "this raises the possibility that this variability is caused by a disk instability ( either the thermal disk instability that leads to dwarf nova outbursts operating at a low level or some other form of disk instability ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of di lac is fit almost equally well by the three models we tried : a simple blackbody , a raymond - smith thermal plasma , and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "more complicated models ( e.g. involving multiple components , lines , etc . )",
    "are unwarranted due to the low x - ray flux .",
    "in addition to being the most physically plausible x - ray emission emission mechanism in a ( non - magnetic ) cv , the bremsstrahlung model is formally the best - fitting .",
    "our x - ray spectrum model fit parameters ( @xmath5 kev ) are consistent with those obtained from @xmath20 x - ray spectra of a sample of 37 disk - accreting cvs @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray count rates in both of these systems were too low for any conclusions to be made about their time - resolved x - ray behavior .",
    "x - ray observations sample the innermost disk region , and we would expect to see different time - resolved behavior as the novae go into their optically bright state if the transition is triggered by a disk instability vs.  a change in @xmath79 from the secondary star .",
    "additional time - resolved x - ray observations using the more sensitive _ chandra _ and/or _ xmm",
    "_ x - ray satellites may be necessary to illuminate the inner workings of these old novae .",
