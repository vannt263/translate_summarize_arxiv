    "the paris - mva advanced analysis method is based on a combination of both already - known and newly - derived parameters , combined in an multi - variate analysis ( mva ) .",
    "details can be found in @xcite & references therein .",
    "a total of eight parameters are used as input . the first two are standard `` hillas '' image moment - based parameters : mean - scaled width and mean - scaled length .",
    "the 3d - model @xcite provides three further event parameters which are powerful discriminants : 3d - reduced - width , its error as given by the likelihood maximization , and the fitted depth of shower maximum .",
    "finally three newly - defined parameters have been developed , which are described below and in @xcite .",
    "all these parameters are input to the root software suite s tmva framework @xcite , applying an mva based on boosted decision trees ( bdts ) .",
    "careful testing of the decision tree design ( depth , pruning etc . ) was carried out , for example to avoid over - training .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the input parameters were chosen from a larger set using the tests provided in the tmva package to avoid correlated parameters , since these reduce the efficiency of the bdt procedure .",
    "the training of the bdts was carried out in a large number of bins ( 27 ) : over a wide range in energy , for nine bins in a related 3d - model parameter , @xmath1 , which provides an estimate of the number of cherenkov photons emitted by the shower ; and for three classes in event multiplicity ( 2 , 35 , and 660 telescopes events ) independently of telescope type .",
    "the bdt procedure combines the parameters for each bin in an optimal manner , to provide a single output bdt - parameter on which to cut .",
    "note that the relative efficiency of different parameters varies widely , especially as a function of energy . for paris - mva",
    ", we choose energy - dependent cuts ( i.e. in @xmath1 bins ) using pre - defined @xmath2-ray efficiencies ( e.g. being more restrictive at low energies where the background is more difficult to eliminate but the signal @xmath2-rays are more abundant ) .",
    "note that we explicitly chose not to use goodness - of - fit type discriminants , as these require an excellent understanding of detector characteristics for proper application .",
    "paris - mva uses a simple , fast energy - reconstruction procedure , baptized `` oak '' .",
    "monte - carlo simulations provide charge profiles as a function of impact parameter ( @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 ) , for given ranges in energy @xmath5 , and in depth of shower maximum @xmath6 .",
    "the simulated profiles obtained are first inverted , to obtain profiles of @xmath5 vs. @xmath3 for given ranges in @xmath4 ; these profiles are stored for the reconstruction phase .    in the energy - reconstruction phase , for a given telescope ,",
    "the reconstructed @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( determined from the hillas parameters ) allow to choose which histograms in @xmath4 and which bins in @xmath3 enter into the interpolation ( using a weighted tree ) for the energy @xmath7 estimated based on that telescope s information . in the final step , the energies of all the telescopes implicated in an event are combined in a sum weighted by each telescope s charge , giving the estimate of the @xmath2-ray energy .    for paris - mva in cta , a linear correction with @xmath8 ( determined from the monte - carlo simulations ) is made in order to take out residual biases , for comparative plots with other analysis techniques .",
    "note that for operational detectors , the standard spectral determination techniques take into account and correct for these biases , allowing to plot fitted spectra versus the true photon energy .",
    "the results for example at @xmath9 show an energy resolution of 13% with @xmath10% bias being achieved .      the three newly - developed parameters input to the bdt , described in @xcite ,",
    "are based on the exploitation of the differences in shower development for signal @xmath2-rays versus the hadronic background .",
    "these give , for example , incoherences in the 3d - model ( mis-)fit of a hadronic shower with a gamma - ray model .",
    "the images ( pixel values ) predicted in each camera by the 3d - model minimization can be used as the basis for a new set of hillas parameters ( _ hillasonmodel _ ) which are then used to define the new discriminant parameters .    the first new discriminant parameter , @xmath11 , is defined as the angle between the shower direction determined from the original _ hillas _ parameters , and that determined from the _ hillasonmodel _ parameters .",
    "two further sensitive discriminant parameters can be defined , based on the oak energy reconstruction algorithm . by reversing the _ oak _ procedure , given the energy determined from oak",
    ", we can `` predict '' the charge seen in each telescope , so giving @xmath12 , the sum of the squared difference between the observed and predicted charges , divided by the summed observed charges .",
    "finally , we can define @xmath13 : the ratio of the energy as determined from the initial hillas parameters to that found from hillasonmodel .",
    "these three new parameters have been shown for h.e.s.s .  to provide a gain of 20% in background rejection for fixed @xmath2-ray efficiency .",
    "some slight modifications of the 3d - model fitting procedure have been implemented . for the initial condition to the fitting procedure , we use length , width , and shower maximum estimations based only on largest contiguous cluster in each telescope ( after standard image cleaning ) .",
    "also , the information from a telescope is used in the 3d - fit only if it has a total charge @xmath14 and with at most 3 clusters of contiguous pixels after standard image cleaning .",
    "these modifications allow to adapt the fit convergence for the largest , high - multiplicity events seen with cta .",
    "all the results were obtained using simulations from the simtelarray package @xcite , at @xmath15 from zenith , with @xmath2-rays simulated on - axis between @xmath16@xmath17 , diffuse electrons in the same energy range , and diffuse protons between @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "the effective area after paris - mva bdt cuts and energy - dependent @xmath20 cut is shown in fig .",

    "( c ) differential sensitivity for a point - source as calculated for array `` i '' , for paris - mva vs.  standard analysis . ]    for the sensitivity calculation shown here , the proton background is scaled by a factor of 1.1 to take into account the presence of heavier species in the charged cosmic - ray flux , and proton and electron background spectra are taken into account . the performance of cta is shown in fig .",
    "[ mva_colla_angres_diffsensi](c ) , as applied to the example array `` i '' ( see @xcite ) , an array consisting of 77 telescopes ( 3 large size telescopes , 24 m diameter , @xmath21 fov ; 18 mid - size , @xmath22 m , @xmath23 ; and 56 small - size 7.4 m , @xmath24 ) , which is optimized for a good wide - energy - range performance .",
    "the figure shows the differential point - source sensitivity in energy bins ( 5 bins per decade , requirement of @xmath25 per bin ) for 50h observation , for the paris - mva analysis as compared with that derived from a standard hillas analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "paris - mva was conceived to be flexible , and was implemented within a standard tmva environment ; these features enabled it to be rather quickly adapted from h.e.s.s .  to be applied to cta .",
    "some modifications have been made to the initialization of the fit in the 3d - model fitting procedure to achieve reasonable convergence at the highest energies ( difficult to reach with h.e.s.s .  with high statistics ) , though further work still needs to be done , perhaps to the 3d - model itself ( e.g. , to take into account the instrument s integration window ) .",
    "it is readily apparent that the application of the advanced paris - mva analysis technique , combining within the mva framework both previously - known and newly - defined sensitive discrimination variables , allows the performance of the cta observatory to be improved by a factor @xmath0 over the standard analysis .",
    "comparative studies of the performance under different array layouts and with the different electronics concepts have begun , and should allow the future cta array to be optimized @xcite taking into account such advanced analyses ."
