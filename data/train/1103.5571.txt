    "the paper of freedman - gompf - morrison - walker @xcite about the potential application of khovanov homology in solving the 4-dimensional smooth poincar conjecture ( spc4 ) revitalized this important subfield of topology .",
    "a sequence of papers appeared , some settling 30-year - old problems ( @xcite ) , some introducing new potential exotic 4-spheres ( @xcite ) and further works showing that the newly introduced examples are , in fact , standard @xcite .",
    "one underlying construction for producing examples of potential exotic 4-spheres is the gluck twist along an embedded @xmath3 ( a _ 2-knot _ ) in the standard 4-sphere @xmath2 . in this construction",
    "we remove the tubular neighbourhood of the 2-knot and glue it back with a specific diffeomorphism .",
    "( for a more detailed discussion , see section  [ sec : gluckdefs ] . ) in turn , any 2-knot in @xmath2 admits a _",
    "normal form _ , and hence can be described by an ordinary knot in @xmath4 , together with two sets of ribbon bands ( determining the ` southern ' and ` northern ' hemispheres of the 2-knot ) . applying standard ideas of kirby calculus ( see , for example , @xcite ) the complement of a 2-knot , and from there the result of the gluck twist , can be explicitly drawn . from such a presentation",
    "then we derive the following result .     with the two ribbon bands @xmath5 and @xmath6 , giving rise to the 2-knot @xmath7.,height=226 ]    [ t : main ] consider the knot @xmath1 depicted by figure  [ fig : kpqribbons ] , and use the bands @xmath5 and @xmath6 to construct the southern and northern hemispheres of a 2-knot @xmath7 .",
    "then gluck twist along the 2-knot @xmath0 provides the 4-sphere with its standard smooth structure .    for certain choices of @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "the 1-knot @xmath1 can be identified more familiarly : for instance , @xmath10 is isotopic to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the figure-8 knot ( isotopic to its mirror image @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the @xmath15 knot , while @xmath16 is @xmath17 in the standard knot tables .",
    "notice that in @xcite the knot @xmath15 defines the 2-knot along which the gluck twist is performed , although the bands used in @xcite are potentially different from @xmath5 and @xmath6 used in the theorem above , cf .",
    "before we prove the above result , in sections  [ sec:2knots ] and [ sec : gluckdefs ] we briefly invoke basic facts about 2-knots , the gluck twist , and the derivation of a kirby diagram for the result of the gluck twist along a 2-knot given by a ribbon 1-knot and two sets of ribbons .",
    "in section  [ sec : proof ] then a simple kirby calculus argument provides the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "( a slightly different argument , still within kirby calculus , for the same result is given in an appendix . )    * acknowledgements * : the authors would like to acknowledge support by the _ lendlet _ program of the hungarian academy of sciences .",
    "the second author was partially supported by otka grant nk 81203 .",
    "we also want to thank zoltn szab for numerous enlightening discussions .",
    "every 2-knot is equivalent to one in normal form @xcite , that is , for a 2-knot @xmath18 there is an ambiently isotopic @xmath19 ( i.e. @xmath20 with a projection @xmath21 such that @xmath8 restricted to @xmath22 gives a morse function with the properties :    1 .   @xmath23 $ ] some @xmath24 , 2 .",
    "all index-0 critical points are in @xmath25 , 3 .",
    "all index-1 critical points with negative @xmath8-value give fusion bands within @xmath26 , 4 .",

    ", this means that any 2-knot @xmath31 is formed from the union of two _",
    "ribbon 2-disks _ glued together along their boundaries which is the same ( ribbon ) 1-knot @xmath28 for both .",
    "since such a ( ribbon disk ) hemisphere @xmath32 of a 2-knot has a handlebody with only 0- and 1-handles , we can construct a kirby diagram for any ribbon disk complement in the 4-disk @xmath33 , and from there for any 2-knot in @xmath2 as follows ( cf .",
    "* chapter  6 ) ) .",
    "[ lem:1 ] let @xmath31 be a 2-knot given by the union of two ribbon disks with equatorial 1-knot @xmath28 , lower hemisphere ribbon presentation @xmath34 , and upper hemisphere ribbon presentation @xmath35 , as above .",
    "then a handlebody for @xmath36 can be constructed by the following algorithm :    1 .   at each @xmath37 ribbon ,",
    "split from @xmath28 into a dotted circle component and add a 2-handle as in the left diagram of figure  [ fig : ribbonhandles ] , 2 .   at each @xmath38 ribbon ,",
    "add the 2-handle as in the right diagram of figure  [ fig : ribbonhandles ] , and 3 .",
    "add a 3-handle for each ribbon of @xmath38 and then a single 4-handle .",
    "let us start with describing the complement of one ribbon disk @xmath32 ; let @xmath39 denote the ribbon disk complement .",
    "its handlebody starts with a 0-handle ( four ball ) @xmath40 .",
    "then , for each 0-handle of @xmath32 which is carved out , a ( 4-dimensional ) 1-handle is added to @xmath40 to form the 1-handlebody @xmath41 . finally , the ribbons ( or 1-handles ) of @xmath32 each yield 2-handles in the complement , and these are attached along curves formed from the union of push - offs of the core 1-disk of the ribbons ( cf .",
    "* section  6.2 ) ) .",
    "the attaching circles have 0-framings since push - offs of the core do not link . therefore the result can be easily presented from a diagram of the equatorial knot @xmath28 by locally replacing the bands with the diagram presented on the left of figure  [ fig : ribbonhandles ] .",
    "next consider the special case when @xmath31 is the 2-knot which we get by doubling the disk @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath42 . in this case",
    "a kirby diagram for the knot exterior @xmath43 can be built up easily from the handlebody decomposition of @xmath32 .",
    "this amounts to taking the above disk complement @xmath44 and adding a second `` upside - down '' copy of @xmath44 ( relative to the carved out 2-disk @xmath32 , so that the result is still a manifold with boundary ) . for each ribbon in the upper hemisphere , again we add a 2-handle to the complement .",
    "however with @xmath32 `` turned upside - down '' in the upper hemisphere , the ribbons have cores and co - cores opposite to their counterparts in the lower hemisphere .",
    "consequently , the 2-handles added in the upper hemisphere s complement have attaching curves formed from the union of two co - cores of the original ribbons of @xmath32 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : doubledribbonhandles ] , where a pair of 0-handles of @xmath31 and a 1-handle fusing them together gives the handlebody configuration in the complement on the right , with the vertical 2-handle depicting the `` upside - down '' copy coming from the upper hemisphere of @xmath31 ( and `` dotted circles '' depicting the 4-dimensional 1-handles ) . moreover , for each of the upper hemisphere 2-handles ( corresponding to 0-handles of @xmath32 ) , we get a 3-handle , and then finally a 4-handle to complete the description of the complement of @xmath31 . for a similar discussion see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise  6.2.11(b ) ) .     from a 1-handle in ( each copy of )",
    "@xmath32.,width=264 ]    finally consider the general case , when the 2-knot @xmath31 is formed from two disks @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( as ` southern ' and ` northern ' hemispheres ) ; i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "the recipe above provides a diagram for @xmath48 and for @xmath49 .",
    "we only need to replace @xmath50 with @xmath48 to get a diagram for @xmath51 .",
    "this simply amounts to finding a diffeomorphism between the boundaries of @xmath48 and @xmath50 , and then pulling back the attaching circles of the 2-handles of @xmath52 to the diagram of @xmath48 . by converting the dots to 0-framings ,",
    "sliding the ( once dotted , now 0-framed ) circles on each other and then canceling ( in the 3-dimensional sense ) the obvious handle pairs , we see that both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are diffeomorphic to the result of 0-surgery along the equatorial knot @xmath28 . using this diffeomorphism , the pull - back provides the attaching circle given in the statement , concluding the proof .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 is a given 2-knot in the 4-sphere . remove a normal neighborhood @xmath55 of @xmath56 from the 4-sphere and reglue @xmath57 by the diffeomorphism of the boundary @xmath58 @xmath59 given by @xmath60 for @xmath61 the rotation with angle @xmath62 of the 2-sphere about the axis through its poles .",
    "the above construction is called the _ gluck twist _ along the 2-knot @xmath63 .",
    "the result of the gluck twist along the 2-knot @xmath18 will be denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "since the result @xmath64 of a gluck twist is simply connected , freedman s celebrated theorem implies that @xmath64 is homeomorphic to @xmath2 .    for a 2-sphere @xmath31 embedded in the 4-sphere , a handlebody for @xmath55 consists of a 0-handle plus one 2-handle attached along a 0-framed unknot",
    "this can also be built `` upside down '' from its boundary @xmath65 by attaching the ( dualized ) 2-handle @xmath66 along any meridian @xmath67 of the sphere , and then attaching the dualized 0-handle as a 4-handle .",
    "therefore , if a handlebody diagram for the knot exterior @xmath68 is given , then one can reconstruct @xmath2 by attaching the 2-handle @xmath66 along a 0-framed meridian of any 1-handle @xmath69 corresponding to a 0-handle of @xmath31 .",
    "the homotopy sphere @xmath70 resulting from the gluck twist on @xmath31 then can be formed from @xmath71 by attaching the 2-handle @xmath66 with @xmath72-framing along the same meridional circle of the 1-handle @xmath69 ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise  6.2.4 ) ) .",
    "note that all the further attaching circles of 2-handles linking the 1-handle @xmath69 can be slid off @xmath69 by the use of @xmath66 , and then @xmath69 and @xmath66 can be cancelled against each other .",
    "therefore , in practice the presentation of the gluck twist along @xmath31 amounts to blowing down one of the dotted circles corresponding to a 0-handle of @xmath31 as if the dotted circle was a @xmath73-framed ( or a @xmath74-framed , up to our choice ) unknot .",
    "notice also that in the preceding section we presented a diagram for @xmath71 which admits a 4-handle . since in gluing @xmath75 back",
    "we add a further 4-handle , one of them can be cancelled against a 3-handle .    in @xcite a further alternative of the effect of the gluck twist",
    "is presented .",
    "since the rotation @xmath61 involved in the gluing map fixes both poles @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the 2-sphere , there are two resulting fixed circles @xmath78 and @xmath79 of @xmath80 . presenting @xmath75 as the union of a 0-handle , a 1-handle and two 2-handles ( or in the upside down picture two 2-handles @xmath81 and @xmath82 , a 3- and a 4-handle ) , one can construct @xmath70 from @xmath71 by attaching the two 2-handles @xmath66 and @xmath83 ( one along @xmath78 and one along @xmath79 with framings @xmath74 and @xmath73 , respectively ) and a 3- and 4-handle , where the two attaching circles are meridional circles of two dotted circles ( corresponding to two 0-handles of @xmath31 ) . once again , since the 2-handles can be slid over @xmath66 and @xmath83 , and then these 2-handles can cancel the corresponding dotted circles , in practice the gluck twist along @xmath31 amounts to simply blowing down two dotted circles as if one were a @xmath74- , the other a @xmath73-framed unknot ( and then adding a 3- and a 4-handle ) .",
    "as before , one 3-handle cancels one of the two 4-handles appearing in the decomposition .    in conclusion ,",
    "if a 2-knot @xmath31 in normal form is given in @xmath2 by a ribbon knot @xmath28 with two sets of bands @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then the above description provides a simple algorithmic way of producing a handle decomposition of the result @xmath64 of the gluck twist along @xmath31 .",
    "notice furthermore that if @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 ) then the resulting decomposition can be chosen not to contain any 1-handles .",
    "for some special classes of 2-knots @xmath31 , the diffeomorphism type of @xmath70 is well - understood : in @xcite gordon proved that @xmath70 is diffeomorphic to @xmath2 for any twist - spun 2-knot @xmath31 .",
    "then in @xcite melvin showed that every ribbon 2-knot @xmath31 has @xmath70 standard as well . additionally , since any ribbon 2-knot is the double of a ribbon 2-disk , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 6.2.11(b ) ) gives an alternate proof of this second result .",
    "for @xmath86 ( possibly non - distinct ) integers let @xmath1 be the knot of figure  [ fig : kpqribbons ] . this is a ribbon knot of 1-fusion , that is , there is a ribbon presentation of @xmath1 such that performing the indicated single ribbon move transforms the knot into a two - component unlink . in fact , there are two apparent choices for the single ribbon move ( or two apparently distinct ribbon presentations ) .",
    "these are indicated by the fine - lined bands @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) of figure  [ fig : kpqribbons ] .",
    "either of these ribbon presentations corresponds to a ribbon 2-disk which we will denote by @xmath89 ( @xmath88 ) .     define the 2-knot @xmath0 as the union @xmath90    following the recipe of section  [ sec : gluckdefs ] we exhibit a handlebody description of the result @xmath91 of the gluck twist along @xmath0 . in doing so ,",
    "first we present a diagram for @xmath92 in figure [ fig : kpqunion ] below :     minus two 3-handles and one 4-handle.,height=226 ]    figures  [ fig:1iso1 ] through [ fig : kpqpi1 ] demonstrate an isotopy of the above diagram of @xmath93 into a form where the 1-handles are visibly separated . in figure  [ fig:1iso1 ]",
    "we have the result of undoing the @xmath8-twist in the first 1-handle and then starting to isotope the 2-handle through the second 1-handle . in figure",
    "[ fig:1iso3 ] , the @xmath9-twist of the second 1-handle is undone by twisting the indicated four strands of the 2-handle .",

    "in particular , @xmath95 and @xmath96 have distinct alexander polynomials if the pairs of parities are distinct .",
    "in the three cases other than @xmath86 both even , @xmath103 is asymmetric and therefore it is not the alexander polynomial of a 1-knot .",
    "consequently , @xmath95 can not be a spun knot if @xmath86 are not both even .",
    "now we are ready to provide a proof of the main result of the paper :    after isotoping the small 2-handle until it becomes parallel to the rightmost dotted circle and blowing down the two dotted circles ( as the implementation of the gluck twist demands ) we arrive at figure  [ fig : bdgluck ] . finally , figure [ fig : gluckfree ] ( obtained by performing the indicated handle slide in [ fig : bdgluck ] )",

    "for the particular case of the 2-knot @xmath95 there is , in fact , a way to see that the gluck twist leaves @xmath2 standard without separating the 1-handles first .    starting in @xmath93 ( cf .",
