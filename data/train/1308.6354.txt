    "this is equivalent to retaining only the first two cumulants and is valid for times long enough that states lying outside the second - order truncation validity are damped out .",
    "the long - time criterion can be estimated by considering the strong - coupling limit . in this case , the second - order taylor series approximation to the eigenvalue spectrum is accurate to within 10% ( 20% ) for the real ( imaginary ) part of the eigenvalue spectrum for @xmath191 on this sphere , the real part of the eigenvalue is down to @xmath192 of its maximum value within the lowest band .",
    "therefore , the long - time criterion for the gaussian approximation is @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the timescale for the lowest - band approximation , given by eq .",
