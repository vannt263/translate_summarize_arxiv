    "in this section we study the stochastic dynamics of a combination of two fundamental processes : particles giving birth to new particles at rate @xmath3 ; and pair annihilation at rate @xmath4 . in that case",

    "we confirm our calculations by comparison to a direct numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "the microscopic rules that govern this process are : @xmath8 the exact master equation for @xmath6 , the probability of having @xmath2 particles , is @xmath9 + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\left[-n(n-1)p_n + ( n+2)(n+1)p_{n+2}\\right]\\ ] ] at the mean - field level the process is described by the reaction equation , @xmath10 which has the stable solution @xmath11 .",
    "technically , this expression may be derived from the exact master equation ( [ master ] ) by calculating the time derivative of the average population @xmath12 and using the approximation @xmath13 .",
    "the stable solution becomes metastable due to the effect of stochastisity ( in particular , all particles may annihilate each other and the system will be stuck in the absorbing state @xmath14 ) .",
    "our aim is to calculate the typical time of this extinction event .",
    "since that stochastic process has no memory ( a markov process ) it may be described by a transition matrix that specify the rates to pass from one microscopic configuration to the other .",
    "clearly , the absorbing state @xmath15 is an eigenvector of that matrix with an eigenvalue 0 .",
    "all other eigenstates admit negative eigenvalues , and we denote the absolute value of the highest of these eigenvalues as @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector is the stochastic metastable state , so our mission is to calculate @xmath16 .",
    "our main interest is in the case @xmath17 so that the typical number of particles is large .",
    "this implies that the probability to reach the absorbing state is , as we will calculate , exponentially small .",
    "the metastability of the system implies that at long times the @xmath6 decay exponentially as @xmath18 .",
    "thus we need to solve the master equation with the left - hand side replace by @xmath19 . however ,",
    "since @xmath16 is exponentially small , we can drop this term altogether .",
    "technically this implies that we only have to solve for a steady state vector rather than doing time dependent semiclassical analysis which is much more complicated .      the standard approach for solving the now time - independent master equation is to transform it into a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the nominal prescription for doing this is to expand @xmath20 , etc . in a taylor series , dropping terms involving more than two derivative .",
    "however , phrasing the problem this way does not explain why , or more specifically , when this procedure is justified ; moreover , the emerging equation is not unique - the same expansion may be done for @xmath21 , for example , yielding different equation .",
    "the real justification underlying the fokker - planck approximation is that , for small @xmath22 , @xmath6 is a smooth function of the @xmath23 variable @xmath24 then , @xmath25 is equal to @xmath26 and so may be expanded formally with regard to the small parameter @xmath27 .",

    "thus the the fp equation is only valid up to @xmath37 , as mentioned above .",
    "this limit on the fp reliability is clearly demonstrated in figure [ nppfig ] , where for a metastable population of 100 individuals the fp solution is a good approximation to the exact probability distribution between 100 and 70 .    to find the decay rate , however ,",
    "we need to have a solution valid down to @xmath38 , and the fp solution does not suffice . one can try to consider the low @xmath2 limit of the master equation .      in the vicinity of the absorbing state one",
    "may use a simplified form of the master equation , exploiting the fact that @xmath6 is a rapidly growing function of @xmath2 .",
    "then , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , yielding the simplified recursion relation : @xmath41 this approximate recursion relation leaves the even and odd @xmath2 s decoupled , and has the solution @xmath42 with @xmath34 , @xmath43 arbitrary .",
    "examining eq .",
    "( [ nplownrec ] ) , we see that if @xmath44 , then as long as @xmath45 , our assumption leading to the approximate recursion relation is valid .",
    "it is also clear that the rapid rise of the @xmath6 s slows as @xmath2 increases , with the @xmath6 s reaching a maximum at @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , however , the maximum probability state is at @xmath47 , so the recursion relation must fail before the bulk regime .",

    "this implies that @xmath61 integrating , we find that @xmath62 the first important point to notice is that @xmath63 extrapolates , in the interesting region , from @xmath64 as @xmath65 to unity , where @xmath66 .",

    "a series of mathematical `` miracles '' occur , which allow for a simple calculation of the extinction rate ( for the case of an initial even number of particles ) without recourse to the wkb method .",
    "furthermore , we present a solution of the probability distribution to _ all _ orders in @xmath22 , so that the corrections are exponentially small .",

    "it should be noted that the mean - field equation for the model is the exact same as that of the original model above .",
    "we again start with the master equation , which now reads : @xmath123 + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\left[-n(n-1)p_n + ( n+2)(n+1)p_{n+2}\\right]\\ ] ] as above , @xmath16 is exponentially small , and we may drop this term altogether .",
    "we again tackle the master equation by exploiting the fast growth of the @xmath6 s for not too large @xmath2 .",
    "this observation allows us to drop the second @xmath3 term and the first @xmath4 term , yielding the recursion relation @xmath124 which , up to a factor of 2 , is the same as the approximate recursion relation we previously encountered .",
    "now , however , the parity conservation implies that only the even terms are nonzero , with the odd terms being exactly decoupled .",
    "the recursion relation has the solution @xmath125    in principle , we should have to match this solution to the wkb solution , as we did in the nonparity case .",

    "we find @xmath133 for the moment , what is important is the leading order asymptotics of this , which can be calculated directly by applying laplace s method to the sum .",
    "this is equivalent to integrating the gaussian , and gives @xmath134    we are essentially done .",
    "the rate of probability flux out to the absorbing state is @xmath135 , which equals @xmath136 .",
    "thus , @xmath137 note again that this is much smaller than the naive fokker - planck answer , which is proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "we can actually proceed to compute the corrections to this formula .",
    "one source of corrections is using the asymptotics of @xmath139 .",
    "the full asymptotics of @xmath139 for large argument are very beautiful : @xmath140 this is obviously a divergent series , and alternatively represents a resummation of the series .",
    "this result is easily proven by substituting it in the hypergeometric differential equation .",
    "the second source of the corrections is the corrections to the @xmath6 s due to the terms we dropped in the master equation .",

    "the new fp equation now reads @xmath204 we have assumed the time dependence is exponential , and are looking for the smallest eigenvalue @xmath59 .",
    "we shall see that @xmath59 vanishes in the @xmath205 limit , consistent with the power - law behavior found by p - l .",
    "it is useful to transform the fp equation to shroedinger form .",
    "the first step in this process is to change variables to @xmath206 .",
    "this yields the equation @xmath207 the next step is a similarity transformation to eliminate the first derivative @xmath208 yielding the schroedinger equation @xmath209 clearly , in the absence of @xmath4 there is no bound state .",
    "rather there is a continuum that starts at zero .",
    "the potential with @xmath4 has a single minimum , which is negative . nevertheless , the ground state energy is positive , yielding a decay rate .",
    "the scaling of the decay rate is clear ; by rescaling @xmath210 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 disappear from the equation , with the decay rate scaling as @xmath211 .",
    "as advertised , we verify the vanishing of @xmath59 with @xmath4 .",
    "the presence of @xmath4 has set the scale of ( the surviving ) @xmath2 s , namely @xmath212 , which is large for small @xmath4 .",
    "lastly , the @xmath213 nature of the @xmath3 potential is clearly a result of the scale - free nature of the @xmath165 problem . to get the prefactor multiplying the @xmath214",
    ", we have to numerically solve the rescaled shroedinger equation , ( i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ threshfpq ] ) with @xmath215 ) yielding the result @xmath216 the resulting scaled @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "[ threshp ] , together with the rescaled exact numerical solution of the master equation for @xmath120 .",
    "we see that @xmath6 is strongly peaked at the origin , corresponding to the zero particle mean - field solution .",
    "the scaling with @xmath4 we obtained is the same as found by doering , et al .",
    "however , as opposed to the other cases examined herein , the prefactor is different as now the mean time to extinction is not simply the inverse of the decay rate .",
    "this is due to the fact that all the eigenvalues of the master equation scale as @xmath214 , whereas the other cases exhibited a single exponentially small eigenvalue .",
    "we have solved for the fluctuation - induced extinction rates of various models exhibiting a macroscopic metastable state .",
    "our primary methodology is use the wkb method for difference equations to directly solve the master equation .",
    "this wkb solution then has to be matched to the low-@xmath2 @xmath6 s , since the wkb method is a large @xmath2 approximation .",
    "this technique is quite general and straightforward to implement , and produces quite accurate results as long as there are not too few particles in the metastable state .",
    "it reproduces the doering , et al .",
    "results for the case of general one - particle transitions and generalizes to higher - order transitions .",
    "we have also shown the unique mathematical properties of the even / odd parity conserving model , where we are able to generate the full asymptotic expansion for the decay rate to all orders , and even to resum this divergent asymptotic series .",
    "one interesting point which arises from this analysis is the sensitivity of the decay rate to the exact form of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "this is apparent in the very different dominant @xmath118 for the case of the parity and non - parity cases .",
    "this is also the case when one compares the logistic model with spontaneous decay studied in section [ gamsec ] , to the same model where the collision process @xmath217 is replaced by @xmath218 at twice the rate . even at the level of the fokker - planck dynamics valid near the metastable state , the widths of the distributions are different , with the variance",
    "@xmath219 being replaced by @xmath5 .",
    "the values of @xmath76 in the two cases are very different , where eq .",
    "( [ npdels ] ) for the two - particle annihilation should be compared to @xmath220 thus , while the two expressions agree near threshold , where the fokker - planck description is sufficient , as @xmath158 approaches 0 , @xmath221 for the two - particle annihilation case , as we saw in section 1 , whereas @xmath222 , almost twice as large , for small @xmath158 in the @xmath218 case .",
    "parenthetically , it should be noted that the small @xmath158 limit is very singular in this latter case , as naively @xmath16 seems to diverge as @xmath223 for small @xmath224 . in general , for small @xmath4 and @xmath158 , the decay rate can be shown to be given by @xmath225 as so indeed vanishes as @xmath189 , since there is no extinction in this case . in situations where the fokker - planck equation is valid all the way down to @xmath226 , as we saw was the case at threshold , at least the problem is parameterized by only two parameters , the center and width of the gaussian .",
    "however , in general , the entire function @xmath70 is involved in the calculation of @xmath76 .",
    "this should have important implications for the study of extinctions in the ecological community , for example , where reliable microscopic models are difficult if not impossible to obtain .",

    "<S> this general scheme is shown to reproduce the known results in the field , to yield new corollaries and to fit quite precisely the numerical solutions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it allows for systematic improvement via a series expansion where the small parameter is the inverse of the number of individuals in the metastable state .    </S>",
    "<S> local extinction due to demographic stochasticity is a key issue in the analysis of persistence and viability of small populations.@xcite in particular , it allows ecologists to identify endangered species and to specify conservation policies , it dictates the appearance and disappearance of favored and neutral genetic mutations @xcite and is of importance in the determination of the critical population size needed to support an epidemic.@xcite as in most cases of rare and extreme events the important quantities to be measured and compared with the theory are the expected extinction time of the populations,@xcite and the probability distribution close to the absorbing state . </S>",
    "<S> technically , however , the effect of demographic stochastisity has traditionally been taken into account using some version of a fokker - planck equation , where the `` diffusion coefficient '' is a function of the population size.@xcite    recently , much interest has been focussed on the calculation of extinction rates for systems whose macroscopic dynamics exhibits a stable state which is nevertheless only metastable due to rare fluctuations which can drive the system to extinction.@xcite in particular , it has been realized that in general the fokker - planck ( fp ) expansion about the ( meta-)stable state is incapable of predicting the extinction rate . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the fokker - planck expansion is only valid for up to @xmath0 fluctuations to the large , @xmath1 , number of particles in the metastable state . </S>",
    "<S> the fp approximation fails to correctly describe the very large fluctuations necessary to reach the absorbing state of zero particles . </S>",
    "<S> the fp treatment also smears out the microscopic differences between processes as it reflects a local analysis close to the metastable fixed point . in order to get the correct statistics for rare and extreme events one should base the estimate on the exact master equation that describes the stochastic process , and to employ the method of extreme statistics , or more simply put , the wkb approximation , to solve the relevant master equation .    </S>",
    "<S> elgart and kamenev @xcite made an interesting observation in this context : using the peliti - doi @xcite technique to map the exact master equation into a `` quantum mechanical '' problem ( schroedinger - like equation in imaginary time with second quantized hamiltonian ) they were able to identify the classical trajectory that connects the metastable fixed point and the absorbing state . </S>",
    "<S> this identification allows them to calculate the classical ( `` geometrical optics '' ) action along this trajectory , a first approximation to the extinction time . </S>",
    "<S> assaf and meerson@xcite then suggest a general spectral method to improve beyond the elgart - kamenev results , employing the generating function formalism and using the sturm - liouville theory of linear differential operators .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will present a general scheme to deal with the local extinction problem , based on the time - independent `` real space '' wkb approximation ( unlike refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite who used a time - dependent momentum space presentation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method presented is easy to use , its intuitive meaning is transparent , and its range of applicability covers , essentially , any single species problem .    this paper will be organized as follows : in the next section we exemplify the technique for what is perhaps _ the _ archetypical problem in this class , a logistic birth - death process of a single species . beside its importance , the solution of this example demands the use of all the components of the technique - a fokker - planck solution applicable close to the metastable fixed point , small @xmath2 approximation close to the absorbing state and a wkb solution that encompasses the fp regime and connects to the small @xmath2 region . </S>",
    "<S> this model , thus , serves also as a nice pedagogical introduction . </S>",
    "<S> the third section deals with a similar birth death process , but when the number of offsprings at each birth event is two , as in the case of domain walls in magnetic systems . here , a series of mathematical `` miracles '' occur , which allow for a simple calculation of the extinction rate ( for the case of an initial even number of particles ) without recourse to the wkb method . in the fourth section the effect of a single agent death term </S>",
    "<S> is incorporated , and in the last section the marginal case of neutral mutation is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we then conclude with a summary and some final observations . </S>"
