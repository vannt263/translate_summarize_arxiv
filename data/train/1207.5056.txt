    "substantial experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted in the past decade to explore the structure of light tin isotopes  @xcite .",
    "the excitation energies of the first @xmath7 states in sn isotopes between @xmath8sn and @xmath9sn are established to possess an almost constant value ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this may be understood from the simple perspectives of generalized seniority scheme  @xcite and pairing correlation  @xcite .",
    "a more realistic description of these nuclei requires a knowledge of the effective interaction between the valence nucleons that govern the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the complete wave functions thus calculated show large overlap with those of the generalized seniority scheme , especially for the low - lying states of isotopes close to the @xmath10 and 82 shell closures  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 pairing channel of the effective interaction has been shown to play an essential role in reproducing the spacings between the ground states and @xmath12 states  @xcite .",
    "possible deviations from the generalized seniority scheme were suggested from @xmath13 measurements in the @xmath12 states @xcite .",
    "a microscopic shell - model description of the configurations of nuclei in the trans - tin region is a challenging task due to the scarceness of available experimental data and the near - degeneracy in energy of the relevant @xmath14 and @xmath15 single - particle orbits  @xcite . in the earlier shell - model calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , the spacing between the two orbits were taken to be @xmath16  mev and 0.5  mev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , excited states in @xmath6sn have been observed using in - beam spectroscopic methods",
    ". the measured spectrum of @xmath6sn is very similar to those of @xmath17sn , with the spin - parity @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the ground state and first excited state . by a shell - model fitting procedure ,",
    "the spacing between @xmath14 and @xmath15 single - particle orbits was predicted to be @xmath20  mev  @xcite .",
    "it has long been expected that the ground state spin of @xmath5sn should be identical to those of @xmath21sn  @xcite which can be approximately viewed as one - quasiparticle states  @xcite . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the configurations of the ground state and first excited state in @xmath5sn were determined to be @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the spins of these states are reversed with respect to those in @xmath6sn .",
    "shell model calculations with empirical interactions have been very successful in explaining the structure and decay properties of light nuclei between @xmath22he and @xmath23sn ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and heavier nuclei around shell closures @xcite .",
    "the key to these calculations is a proper description of the monopole channel of the effective interaction @xcite , which determines the bulk properties of the effective interaction and governs the evolution of the effective single - particle energies ( the mean field ) as a function of valence neutron and proton numbers @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the monopole interaction becomes much more important with increasing valence nucleon numbers @xmath24 since it is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "the light tin isotopes between shell closures @xmath10 and 82 are the longest chain that can be reached by contemporary shell model calculations .",
    "they may provide an ideal test ground to study the competition between different terms of the monopole interaction .",
    "realistic effective interactions obtained from free nucleon - nucleon potentials provide a microscopic foundation to shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "extensive previous shell - model calculations tend to suggest that the realistic interaction can give a satisfactory description of the multipole part but not the monopole channel @xcite , which may be due to the lack of three - body forces @xcite .",
    "this is supported by recent shell - model calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that a better description of the oxygen and calcium chains can be obtained by including the three - body monopole interaction .",
    "moreover , significant progress has been made in a variety of _ ab initio _ calculations with three - body forces for light nuclei within the frameworks of green s function monte carlo @xcite , no - core shell model @xcite and coupled - cluster @xcite approaches . for heavier nuclei ,",
    "a more convenient approach is to treat the monopole interaction empirically @xcite .",
    "thus we are motivated to fine - tune the monopole part of the realistic interaction by fitting to available experimental data in tin isotopes .",
    "one may also get a limitation on the unknown single - particle energies of the orbitals @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . we expect that the refined effective hamiltonian will give a better understanding of the structure of trans - tin nuclei .",
    "we assume the doubly - magic @xmath23sn as the inert core . for the model space",
    "we choose the neutron and proton orbitals between the shell closures @xmath26 and 82 , comprising @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also assume isospin symmetry in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "a common practice in full configuration interaction shell model calculations is to express the effective hamiltonians in terms of single - particle energies and two - body matrix elements numerically ( see , e.g. , the oxbash hamiltonian package @xcite ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 denote the single - particle orbitals and @xmath29 stand for the corresponding single - particle energies .",

    "the overall agreement between experiments and calculations on the pairing gaps are quite satisfactory .",
    "noticeable differences are only seen for mid - shell nuclei @xmath41sn .",
    "this is related to the relatively large difference between experimental and calculated binding energies of @xmath42sn .",
    "it may indicate that the @xmath11 pairing matrix elements in the cd - bonn potential involving the @xmath1 and @xmath0 orbitals may not be perfectly described .    ]",
    "the spins of the ground state and first excited state in @xmath6sn are @xmath43 and 7/2 , respectively @xcite , which are reversed with respect to those in @xmath5sn @xcite . through seniority model analyses with a pairing hamiltonian , ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that the inversion is dominated by orbital - dependent pairing correlations , namely the strength of the pairing matrix elements @xmath44 is much larger than that of @xmath45 .",
    "this produces strong additional binding for the @xmath46 state in @xmath6sn , which eventually becomes the ground state .",

    "@xmath54 denotes the maximal spin value of the two - body matrix elements to be considered .",
    "two different types of calculations are presented in the figure .",

    "the expectation values of such a hamiltonian with respect to the corresponding wave functions @xmath50 of the full hamiltonian @xmath51 , @xmath49 , are plotted as open symbols .",
    "it should be mentioned that calculations with the original cd - bonn interaction and other realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials give a similar pattern .",
    "it is thus seen from fig .",
    "[ sn103 ] that both calculations give similar results concerning the order of the @xmath55 and @xmath53 states .",
    "calculations with the pairing matrix elements only ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) show that the pairing terms , in particular the element @xmath44 mentioned above , can significantly reduce the gap between the two states but were not strong enough to induce the inversion .",
    "a sudden switch is seen when the @xmath57 two - body matrix elements are considered .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ sn103 ] that in both calculations the exact results are also approached by including terms with @xmath58 only .",
    "this is expected since the low - lying states of light tin isotopes mainly occupy the nearly degenerate orbitals @xmath14 and @xmath15 for which the maximal spin is @xmath57 .",
    "thus the contribution from interactions with higher spin values are marginal . among @xmath3 matrix elements the maximal spin one can have",
    "is @xmath59 .",
    "it corresponds to the coupling of two nucleons in the orbital @xmath2 .",
    "calculations in the restricted @xmath60 model space give a result similar to fig .",
    "[ sn103 ] .    among the @xmath57 two - body matrix elements the ones that contribute most to the spin inversion are the repulsive matrix element @xmath61 and",
    "the strongly attractive one @xmath62 .",
    "this can be understood by considering the structure of the wave functions of the two states . in the @xmath18 ground state in @xmath6sn ,",
    "the leading component is @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "its overlap with the total wave function is calculated to be @xmath64 .",
    "one can also construct a three - body state starting from the pair @xmath65 .",
    "the overlap between the state thus constructed and the total wave function is @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath62 term induces a significant additional binding for the @xmath46 state in @xmath6sn , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ sn103 ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that states generated by the two couplings @xmath67 and @xmath68 are not perpendicular to each other .",
    "their overlap is quite large , @xmath69 .",
    "this can be evaluated analytically @xcite .",
    "the overlaps of the total wave function of the first @xmath19 state @xmath6sn with its leading components are calculated to be @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72=0.57 . from a shell - model point of view , the couplings @xmath73 and @xmath74 generate exactly the same three - particle state .",
    "all interaction terms @xmath75 contribute to the total energy of the state @xcite .",
    "it may be interesting to mention that the effect of the maximally aligned pair in single-@xmath76 systems was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .     of the full hamiltonian @xmath51 and those of the pairing hamiltonian with @xmath56 for the first @xmath18 and @xmath19 states in light odd-@xmath77 sn isotopes .",
    "open symbol : same as above but only the non - diagonal pairing matrix elements are considered.[odd ] ]    the influence of the pairing interaction on the structure of tin isotopes was considered in a variety of approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ odd ] we calculated the overlaps between the full shell - model wave functions and those calculated from the pairing hamiltonian including the single - particle terms and the @xmath11 pairing matrix elements .",
    "it is thus seen that the non - diagonal pairing matrix elements @xmath78 play an essential role in inducing the configuration mixing in the first @xmath18 and @xmath19 states of odd-@xmath77 tin isotopes .",
    "the overlap gradually decreases when the number of valence neutrons increases .",
    "this is consistent with the generalized seniority model calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the overlap between the full wave functions and seniority - truncated state also decreases with increasing neutron number .",
    "the structure properties of light tin isotopes are calculated with a global optimized effective interaction .",
    "the unknown single - particle energies of the orbitals @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the monopole interactions are refined by fitting to experimental binding energies . a total number of 157 states in @xmath4sn are considered in the fitting .",
    "the binding energies of these states can be reproduced within an average deviation of about 130 kev .",
    "the largest deviation is around 600 kev which is seen in the nucleus @xmath42sn . with the effective hamiltonian",
    "thus derived we calculate the contributions of the monopole and multipole hamiltonian to the total shell - model energies .",
    "the excitation energies of the low - lying even spin states in even sn isotopes are presented .",
    "we also evaluated the shell model occupancies in the ground states of these nuclei .",
    "detailed systematic calculations on the spectra and decay properties of tin isotopes as well as the list of the two - body matrix elements will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we analyze the origin of the spin inversion between the @xmath79 and @xmath18 states in @xmath6sn and heavier odd tin isotopes in order to explore the possible influence of different interaction channels .",
    "we thus find that both the @xmath11 pairing and the maximally aligned @xmath57 two - body matrix elements produce strong additional binding for the @xmath18 states .",
    "the non - diagonal pairing matrix elements play an essential role in inducing the mixing of different configurations in the wave functions of these states .    within the framework as described in this paper ,",
    "we have done a preliminary optimization of the @xmath36 monopole interaction by fitting to the binding energies of sb , te and i isotopes around the @xmath10 and 82 shell closures .",

    "<S> the unknown single - particle energies of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals and the @xmath3 monopole interactions are determined by fitting to the binding energies of 157 low - lying yrast states in @xmath4sn . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the hamiltonian to analyze the origin of the spin inversion between @xmath5sn and @xmath6sn that was observed recently and to explore the possible contribution from interaction terms beyond the normal pairing . </S>"
