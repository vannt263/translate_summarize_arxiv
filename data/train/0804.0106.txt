    "as it is already known in classical theory , the more is the mass of a charged particle , the less intensive is the radiation from it . in quantum field theory , in particular , qcd , this circumstance leads to a number of impressive effects caused by heavy quarks , as , for instance , the effect of leading mesons which contain @xmath1- and @xmath2-quarks in @xmath0 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the `` radiation '' in qcd is the radiation of gluons , which `` materialize '' afterwards in form of detected hadrons , it is natural to expect , that in events induced by heavy quarks , the hadron multiplicity ( except for decay products of the leading quarks ) is smaller that in analogous events triggered by light quarks .",
    "so natural may be an expectation that the difference between these multiplicities has to disappear at high enough energies .    however , it is not always the case .",
    "for instance , even in qed , the difference between cross sections ( times the c.m .",
    "energy squared ) of fermion - antifermion pairs of different masses produced by two photons , does not disappear with increase of energy , but tends to a constant which depends on the masses of the final fermions  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of hadron multiplicities in @xmath0 annihilation associated with the primary quarks of definite flavors ( in practice , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks are assumed to be massless ) were carried out at lepton colliders with the collision energy of 29 gev and more , in particular , at the slc , kek , lepi and lepii .    in view of a great interest caused by these experiments ( see below ) , and due to the presence of competing theoretical predictions , there is no doubts that similar measurements will be also done at future linear colliders , such as clic or ilc  @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to look for such effects was done in the framework of so - called `` nave model '' .",
    "the essence of this model lies in the fact that an universal mechanism of multiple production of hadrons from some gluon system is adopted , which is insensitive to the quark flavors , while all the difference between processes induced by distinct quark - antiquark pairs arises due to a difference in energy available for the hadron production .    later on ,",
    "another approach was accepted appealing directly to the calculational kit of perturbative qcd . however",
    ", the estimates obtained this time overestimated the data significantly .",
    "for all that , there was a clear indication of the asymptotic constancy of the multiplicity differences from the heavy and light quarks .",
    "not long after , the same quantity , the multiplicity difference in the events with the light and heavy quarks , was calculated more accurately .",
    "the results appeared to be strikingly close to the experimental data .",
    "as was already said , the `` nave model ''  @xcite was the first attempt to take into account hadrons produced in addition to decay products of the heavy quark - antiquark pair in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "later on , it was argued  @xcite that the difference between multiplicities in events induced by heavy ( @xmath6 ) and light ( @xmath7 ) quarks , @xmath8 tends to a constant value with increase of energy @xmath9 : @xmath10 here ( and below ) it is assumed that we deal with _",

    "note that in the gauge   the decay function in evolution equation   is of the form : @xmath225 this results in the effective cut on the integration variable @xmath213 from below : @xmath226 as one can see from and , it is the dynamical bound that smoothes out the singularity of @xmath184 at @xmath227 , but not the bound arising from the gauge vector .",
    "the latter can be safely omitted in eq .  .",
    "thus , we conclude that both the relation of the light quark multiplicity @xmath228 with the gluon multiplicity @xmath211 , and the evolution equation for @xmath59 do not depend on the gauge vector @xmath229 . this conclusion is also valid for a general case , @xmath230 , where @xmath231  @xcite .",
    "note that the proof of the gauge invariance needs an account of the destructive interference in the emission of the gluon jets , that leads to the condition .",
