    "twisted mass lattice qcd ( tmlqcd ) is a variation on the wilson action  essentially a chiral rotation of quark flavor doublets , acting on quark mass terms relative to wilson terms in the action  which produces two desirable features : the removal of unphysical zero modes in quark propagators@xcite and the elimination of @xmath0 artifacts ( where @xmath1 denotes lattice spacing ) at maximal twist@xcite .",
    "a number of numerical simulations have been performed for both quenched and dynamical tmlqcd ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "as well , the chiral perturbation theory for tmlqcd ( tm@xmath2pt ) has been developed .",
    "it differs from continuum @xmath2pt by discretization effects and is required for the extrapolation of tmlqcd data .",
    "the effective theory has also played a vital role in understanding various aspects of tmlqcd such as @xmath0 improvement , the phase diagram , and the relationships between various definitions of maximal twist@xcite .    with an interest in the phenomenology of hadrons built of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks , our goal in this paper",
    "is to explore the usefulness of tmlqcd and tm@xmath2pt as applied to strange hadrons .",
    "there is no unique way to introduce the @xmath5 quark into the calculation .",
    "the method used here , to consider a pair of quark doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is similar to the proposal of pena _",
    "et al._@xcite . for the quenched simulations considered here the partner of the @xmath5 quark does not play an active role and",
    "should not be thought of as the physical charm quark . in this work no mass",
    "splitting is introduced within either doublet .",
    "the construction of the corresponding tm@xmath2pt formalism is a straightforward generalization of the published one - doublet formalism@xcite .    as noted above , applying a relative chiral twist has some valuable consequences but there are also some less desirable features that have to be dealt with .",
    "the tmlqcd action violates parity conservation so , in general , correlation functions contain contributions from states of both parities .",
    "parity mixing can complicate , in particular , the extraction of matrix elements but this can be ameliorated by appropriate tuning of the twist angles .",
    "the tmlqcd action also breaks the flavor symmetry .",
    "for the version of tmlqcd used in this work the members of the quark doublets are degenerate in mass but are distinguished by having opposite chiral twists .",
    "this can lead to mass splittings within hadron isospin multiplets .",
    "it will be seen that charged and neutral kaons can acquire a mass - squared splitting which is roughly proportional to @xmath8 .    to optimize the elimination of @xmath0 lattice discretization errors one has to tune the chiral twist angles@xcite .",
    "there is not a unique way to achieve maximal twist as has been discussed from the point of view of both effective theory@xcite and simulation@xcite .",
    "a standard method for defining maximal twist uses a tuning procedure which involves the correlators of the first two isospin components of vector and axial operators with the pseudoscalar density@xcite . using two variations of this method , we examine the mixing between the third isospin components of scalar and pseudoscalar correlators .",
    "ideally one would like to have a tuning to maximal twist which would banish the physical pseudoscalar meson from appearing in the wrong parity correlator ; the scalar meson with its quenched @xmath9 contribution would similarly be banished from the other parity correlator .",
    "this is seen not to happen in our simulations .",
    "the mixings observed in actual simulations represent higher order discretization effects which differentiate between vector - axial tuning and scalar - pseudoscalar tuning .    in this work",
    ", we mainly use maximal twist in the doublet containing the strange quark as well as in the @xmath6 doublet .",
    "an alternative procedure would be to set the twist angle for the strange quark to zero or equivalently for the quenched theory to consider a twisted @xmath6 doublet and a flavor - singlet wilson strange quark",
    ". the latter approach may be a viable one for doing full dynamical simulations .",
    "the twisted and untwisted strange quark actions lead to different patterns of parity mixing and flavour symmetry breaking at non - vanishing lattice spacing .",
    "we present some results obtained with an untwisted strange quark action to illustrate some of these differences .    at this point",
    "it is worth noting that there exist even other approaches for dealing with the strange quark .",
    "the proposal of frezzotti and rossi in ref .",
    "@xcite allows for a nondegenerate doublet in a way which is suitable for dynamical simulations@xcite . in the limit where quark masses are degenerate within each doublet",
    ", it is equivalent to the scheme used in this paper .",
    "however , for nondegenerate quarks , twist and quark - mass splitting are associated with different flavor transformation generators .",
    "the fermion action contains terms which mix flavors so that flavor symmetry breaking effects would be more complicated to deal with in simulations and in the effective theory than for the tmlqcd action considered in this work .",
    "a further example is ref .",
    "@xcite where options for tmlqcd chosen to facilitate the calculation of the so - called kaon bag parameter are discussed .",
    "in addition to meson masses , the pseudoscalar meson decay constants are also considered . with quark masses fixed by physical meson masses ,",
    "the decay constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 become absolute predictions , and are shown to compare favorably with previous quenched simulations using other actions .",
    "all results are consistent with tm@xmath2pt .",
