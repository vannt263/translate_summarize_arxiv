    "unlike numerous type ii sne with a progenitor identification on pre - explosion images ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , sne iib / ib / ic can currently be constrained only through the analysis of their light .",
    "sne iib / ib / ic events , understood as successful explosions following the core collapse of a h - poor / h - deficient progenitor star , represent a number of challenges for modern astrophysics .",
    "the traditional perspective was that , showing no hydrogen - line features in their spectra , their progenitor massive stars had lost their hydrogen envelope prior to explosion , in the form of a radiatively - driven wind @xcite . during the star s evolution , mass loss progressively peels off the massive - star envelope leaving only a residual hydrogen shell .",
    "eventually this is also peeled away leaving a shell whose composition is dominated by helium and nitrogen ( wn star ; @xcite ) . as evolution and peeling continue , the surface then becomes helium and carbon dominated ( yielding a wc star ; @xcite ) , and then carbon and oxygen dominated ( yielding a wo star ; @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the stiff dependence of mass loss on luminosity / mass , low - mass massive stars lose little mass and die as type ii sne .",
    "consequently sne iib / ib / ic would have to come from higher - mass ( @xmath730 ) massive stars .    from the above simplistic argument",
    ", one can picture a sequence of increasing main - sequence mass as we go through progenitors of sne ii - p , ii - l , iib , ib , and ic @xcite .",
    "recent revisions downwards of massive star steady - state mass - loss rates may challenge this scenario @xcite .",
    "although still quite speculative at present , transient , and perhaps recurrent , phases of intense mass loss ( e.g. , of the eruptive kind seen in @xmath8 car ) may be a viable alternative to steady - state mass loss ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a second issue is the viability of the explosion mechanism for stars of increasing mass , since their higher - mass cores are increasingly more bound , exposing the newly - formed sn shock to a tremendous accretion rate @xcite .",
    "finally , we need to understand what differentiates the progenitors of sne iib , ib and ic , as well as the progenitors of type ic hypernovae which might be associated with a -burst signal ( for a discussion , see e.g.,@xcite ) .    using radiation - hydrodynamics simulations",
    ", @xcite were the first to perform a comprehensive study of hydrogen - less massive - star cores , representative of hydrogen - deficient w - r stars .",
    "based on the available observations of sne ib at that time , they concluded that ejecta from such w - r progenitor models could reproduce the general sn - ib light curve morphology if powered by decay energy from @xmath00.1  of .",
    "however , the generally narrow peak of their light curves supported only 4 - 7  ejecta , corresponding to 1525  progenitor main - sequence masses .",
    "additional sn - ib light curves acquired since the study of @xcite show a similar behaviour , and thus strengthen the notion that the bulk of sne ib are associated with relatively low - mass ejecta @xcite .",
    "since the scenario invoking higher - mass massive stars appears not to be viable , binary - star evolution channel is favored for the production of sne ib / c , as well as sne iib @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion emerges from independent considerations based on the observed sn ib / c rate @xcite .",
    "in addition to single - star evolution models of w - r stars @xcite , we now have physically - consistent predictions for the binary - star counterpart ( @xcite ; see also preliminary explorations of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the critical ingredient of these scenarios is that a star may lose mass through mass transfer to a companion .",
    "consequently , the mass - loss / luminosity scaling that inhibits mass loss in low - mass massive stars does not apply , allowing much lower mass progenitors to explode as  hydrogen - less \" cores .",
    "the best observations and tailored analyses exist for only a few objects , usually the brightest or the weirdest , and thus not representative of the sn iib / ib / ic population . to cite a few , this includes the type iib sn 1993j , associated with a small ejecta mass resulting from the explosion of a rather low - mass progenitor star in a binary system @xcite , with a residual hydrogen envelope @xcite .",
    "the type ic sn 1994i was also the focus of numerous studies , suggesting a low - mass ejecta , potentially non - deficient in helium despite its classification @xcite .",
    "one exception is sn 2008d , which appears as a very standard type ib sn but with a shock breakout detection , hence a very well - defined time of explosion . in this object ,",
    "a short post - breakout plateau is observed before the sn re - brightens merely 4d after explosion and peaks 1mag brighter about 20d later @xcite .",
    "the helium abundance is thought to distinguish sne ib and ic , although the he - line signatures needed to make this assessment can be influenced by numerous complications . due to the high excitation energy needed , he - lines may not be excited , and thus helium could be present but without associated spectral signatures .",
    "in addition , the presence or absence of he  lines is conditioned not just by the composition but also by non - thermal excitation / ionization processes born out of -emission from radioactive decay of  and  isotopes @xcite .",
    "he  lines may therefore be affected by the efficiency of outward mixing of . unfortunately , the mixing characteristics are adjusted for convenience rather than computed from first principles .",
    "further , light - curve and spectral calculations are performed with separate codes that make distinct approximations and thus global physical consistency is lacking in current modelling of sne iib / ib / ic .",
    "many sne ib may have traces of hydrogen at their surface @xcite , and this may even apply to sne ic @xcite . while an interesting possibility , such inferences are always jeopardised by the weakness of the h  features at the heart of the debate ( which suffer from line overlap with c  and si  lines ; see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) and the shortcomings of the radiative - transfer approach used ( e.g. , lte versus non - lte , time - dependent effects on the ionisation , ejecta structure and composition ) .",
    "as emphasised here ( see also @xcite ) , obtaining early - time spectra and light curves of sne iib / ib / ic is the only way to settle this and the he abundance issue .    here",
    ", we present non - lte time - dependent calculations of sn ejecta based on piston - driven explosions of wn and wc / wo progenitor stars .",
    "these sne iib / ib / ic calculations have a higher level of consistency than earlier calculations  they combine stellar - evolutionary models of the progenitors , hydrodynamics calculations of the explosion ( albeit artificial ) , and non - lte time - dependent radiative transfer of the full ejecta yielding simultaneously multi - color light curves and spectra .",
    "we discuss the gas and radiative properties of such sn ejecta and what determines their classification as sn iib , ib , or ic .",
    "our simulations ignore non - thermal electrons and do not include any mixing induced by the explosion,500 . ] and thus set a lower threshold on the expected strength of hi and hei lines .",
    "more importantly , the calculations show that under certain conditions , which we detail , hi and hei lines can be seen even in the absence of any unstable nuclei and high - energy electrons .    in section  [ sect_setup ] ,",
    "we give a brief overview of the models selected from the comprehensive study of @xcite , including how we proceeded from such progenitors to make sn ejecta .",
    "as one aspect of this work is to understand how the progenitor properties effect the h and he lines observed in sn spectra , we discuss the difference in progenitor properties .",
    "we then present our results , discussing simultaneously the properties of the gas ( ejecta ) and of the emergent radiation ( spectra and light curves ) .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that it _",
    "simultaneously _ yields synthetic light curves and spectra , allowing a direct assessment of spectra for a given light - curve phase .",
    "our synthetic bolometric light curves and how they are affected by variations in photospheric conditions are described in section  [ sect_lbol ] .",
    "we then present our synthetic spectra , addressing in turn the potential signatures of hydrogen ( section  [ sect_h ] ) , helium ( section  [ sect_he ] ) , cno elements ( section  [ sect_cno ] ) , intermediate - mass elements ( imes ; section  [ sect_ime ] ) , and iron - group elements ( section  [ sect_z ] ) . a crucial question which we address is when will the resulting sn be classified as type ib , or ic , or iib .",
    "section  [ sect_disc ] is devoted to a discussion of our results , which we confront to observations .",
    "this study is not a review",

    "the radiative - transfer calculations are based on sn ejecta that are produced in two steps .",
    "first , we simulate the evolution of a massive star from the main sequence until an advanced stage ( either the end of neon - core burning or the formation of a degenerate iron core ) .",
    "second , we use radiation hydrodynamics to simulate the explosion by driving a piston at the base of the sn progenitor envelope .    for the stellar - evolution model inputs , we use a sample of simulations presented by @xcite , who focused on binary - star evolution for the production of w - r stars at solar and 1/5th - solar metallicity and who used various primary / secondary masses and a range of orbital periods ( typically on the order of a few days ) . in their study ,",
    "the initial ( final ) mass of the primary was in the range 1260  ( 1.4 - 7.3 ) , the final mass range reflecting the complicated mass - loss and mass - transfer history .",
    "these calculations were performed with an optimized nuclear network that included all elements up to @xmath9 , and iron . in a forthcoming study , a larger network containing all elements up to iron will be included . from this sample ,",
    "we select a few w - r star models with a final mass in the range 3.79 to 7.3 , which we name here bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , bmi25mf5p09z1 , bmi18mf6p49z1 , and bmi18mf7p3z0p2 .",
    "the adopted model nomenclature specifies the evolution channel ( b / s for binary-/single - star evolution ) , the main - sequence mass ( which corresponds to x , given in , in mix ; when present , `` p '' introduces the decimals ) , the mass at the end of the simulation ( which corresponds to x , given in , in mfx ; this value should be very close to that at the time of core collapse in all cases ) , the environmental metallicity ( which corresponds to x , given in units of the solar value , in zx ) .",
    "thus bmi18mf3p79z1 is a binary model for an 18  main - sequence mass , with a final mass of 3.79 , and evolved at solar metallicity .",
    "we also complement this subset with two single - star models .",
    "these include smi60mf7p08z1 , a 20  helium - star model ( 60  star on the main sequence ) evolved at solar metallicity , and smi25mf18p3z0p05 , a 25  model which evolved chemically homogeneously at a metallicity of 0.05z@xmath10 @xcite .    for historical reasons , this set of simulations",
    "is split into two distinct samples ( see below ) .",
    "models bmi18mf3p79z1 ,",
    "bmi18mf4p41z1 , bmi25mf5p09z1 were mapped as single stars and evolved with kepler @xcite until the formation of an iron core , before being exploded by means of a piston ( using a @xmath01.4  mass cut ) to yield an asymptotic ejecta kinetic energy of 1.2b ( where 1b = 1bethe = @xmath11erg ) .",
    "the explosions produced 0.171 , 0.182 , and 0.195  of @xmath12ni respectively , while the velocity of the ejecta shell that bounds 99% of the total /  mass is 2750 , 2510 , and 1250 .",
    "a more detailed presentation covering the post - helium burning evolution and explosion of these and other similar models is deferred to woosley , kasen , & yoon ( in preparation ) .",
    "the 1d lagrangian kepler simulations employ a grid of 500 - 1000 points to cover the ejecta using a mass grid , thus resolving and predicting sharp discontinuities in the composition distribution . in contrast , our radiative - transfer simulations ( performed with cmfgen , see below ) , employ an optical - depth grid which is more relevant for radiation transport than a mass grid , but the drawback is that sharp composition boundaries can not be resolved ( at least without special procedures ) . as we step in time through our sequence , the remapping procedure on such un - mixed models causes numerical diffusion of sharp composition discontinuities , which effectively acts as mixing .",
    "we find that this smears the  profile typically over 500 .",
    "this also leads to a modest change in  ejecta abundance compared to the kepler values , which are now 0.184 , 0.170 , and 0.237for models bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , and bmi25mf5p09z1 ( these cumulative isotopic yields are preserved at the 10% level throughout the time sequence ) .",
    "the second set of models was used without further evolution , remapped into v1d @xcite , and exploded , as in kepler , using a piston ( with a 2.0  mass cut ) to yield an asymptotic ejecta kinetic energy of 1b .",
    ", r@xmath13 , etc . ) would not be changed significantly if they had all been evolved until the formation of a degenerate iron core , since the relevant nuclear timescales are shorter than , e.g. , the kelvin - helmholtz timescale . ]",
    "unstable - nuclei abundances were deliberately set to zero in this second set ( we do not include any explosive nucleosynthesis for those v1d simulations ) . since these models were not evolved until iron - core collapse , the composition of the inner 2 - 3  are not converged .",
    "our discussion of such -deficient models will thus be limited to early times , when the photosphere lies well outside this inner region potentially polluted by  in realistic explosions .",
    "this distinction between our two samples also serves to reveal the effect of decay heating on the light curves and spectra , which can only affect models bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , and bmi25mf5p09z1 .",
    "it also permits a discussion of sne ib light curves and spectra in which unstable nuclei are absent , which could occur , for example , with complete fallback of the inner ejecta .",
    "the splitting of the models into two groups primarily arose because the code of yoon / langer does not follow stellar evolution until the formation of a degenerate and collapsing iron core , and because at the time v1d could not compute explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "there is also a chronological reason for this split .",
    "the work presented in this paper includes computations started in 2008 ( i.e. , models bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , and bmi25mf5p09z1 ) .",
    "later , we realised that for a discussion of the early - time evolution of sne iib / ib / ic , the actual core properties are not directly relevant .",
    "we thus augmented our sample with additional models from @xcite , evolved only until neon - core burning , and exploded them with v1d at this stage of evolution .",
    "our choice of augmenting the sample was made after we had computed the light curve and spectra of models bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , and bmi25mf5p09z1 . by including these -deficient models , we cover a wider range of properties , including higher - mass binary models , single - star models , solar- as well as sub - solar metallicity models , and a chemically - homogeneous model .    in tables",
    "[ tab_presn ] and [ tab_comp ] , we summarise the properties of the progenitors including the surface ( outer ejecta ) composition for the dominant species and the total ejecta yields , in solar masses , for important species . for each model",
    "we also quote the envelope binding energy which is found to be significantly smaller in binary - star than in single - star progenitors ( see also @xcite )  this is a particularly important feature for the explosion mechanism ( see section  [ sect_concl ] ) .",
    "the remnant mass @xmath14 varies from small ( @xmath41.4 ) for the lower - mass models ( evolved until iron - core collapse and exploded with kepler ) up to 2.88  for the rest of the sample .",
    "the larger remnant masses may result , in part , from the flatter density distribution of these model envelopes , a possible artefact of the truncated evolution which prevented the formation of a denser core surrounded by a steeper density decline .",
    "until we know how these stars explode the remnant - mass value we obtain may be inaccurate . at the start of the cmfgen simulations , at 1 - 2d after explosion , all these sn ejecta are in homologous expansion .    since the companion star in our selected binary systems may influence the sn radiation associated with the successful explosion of the primary star , we also give the binary system and secondary star properties .",

    "is 10.9  ( 23.0 ) , 9.3  ( 22.5 ) , 26.0  ( 34.3 ) , 11.8  ( 31.0 ) , and 11.3  ( 35.4 ) .",
    "binary - star progenitor models tend to have larger radii than single - star ones , especially if they have retained a residual hydrogen envelope .",
    "this concerns models bmi18mf3p79z1 and bmi18mf4p41z1 , which both contain a few 0.001  of hydrogen , with a typical surface mass fraction of 0.010.1 .",
    "model bmi25mf5p09z1also has some hydrogen at the surface , but with a very low mass fraction of 6.33@xmath210@xmath15 and a cumulative mass of only 1.39@xmath210@xmath16 .",
    "after the explosion , such low - mass non - hydrogen deficient layers travel at speeds @xmath415000  in this model , lie well above the photosphere past 1d , and thus leave no spectral feature ( section  [ sect_h ] ) .",
    "the bulk of the envelope mass is lost through mass transfer , but the presence of hydrogen at the pre - sn stage is subsequently conditioned primarily by the stellar - wind mass - loss rate . in practice , the pre - sn model surface hydrogen abundance is higher for lower stellar - wind mass loss rates , which can result from the adopted mass - loss recipe , or from sub - solar metallicity ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "all progenitor models , except smi25mf18p3z0p05 , have a rather small final mass , producing ejecta masses as low as 2.39  in model bmi18mf3p79z1 .",
    "the low metallicity single star model , smi25mf18p3z0p05 , produces an ejecta mass of over 15  ejecta  over 3 times that of any other model .",
    "all models contain @xmath01  of helium , with a surface mass fraction that is close to unity in our binary - star models , but substantially lower ( 0.13 and 0.54 ) in the two single star models .",
    "the model ejecta have a similar chemical stratification ( reflecting the analogous progression through h , he , c etc .",
    "core burning ) , but they show quantitative difference in their envelope / ejecta yields . consequently ,",
    "we identify distinct spectroscopic signatures associated with such abundance variations , which complement those associated with h and he .",
    "we evolve our hydrodynamical inputs using the non - lte time - dependent radiative - transfer code cmfgen @xcite .",
    "the approach and setup are analogous to that presented for the type ii - peculiar sn 1987a @xcite and for type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) sne @xcite , and are thus not repeated here .",
    "we assume the sn is free from external disturbances , such as interaction with the pre - sn wind or a companion star , or irradiation from the newly - born neutron star .",
    "importantly , in -rich models , we assume a local deposition of radioactive - decay energy , treated as a pure heating source .",
    "our treatment of decay energy as a pure heating source leads to an underestimate of the excitation and ionisation of the gas at the photosphere as soon  may reach it @xcite .",
    "a corollary is that as long as there is no post - breakout re - brightening of our sn models , we are confident that the photosphere can not be influenced by  from radioactive decay , and thus our computed spectra are not compromised by this approximation .",
    "hence , we can discuss the early - phase spectroscopic evolution of the sn when our non - lte time - dependent approach is physically accurate , starting as early as @xmath51d after shock breakout .",
    "our monte - carlo transport code predicts that  leakage causes @xmath00.01% ( 10% ) of the decay energy to escape at @xmath040d ( @xmath085d ) after explosion in models bmi18mf3p79z1 and bmi18mf4p41z1 . in model bmi25mf5p09z1 , this leakage causes @xmath00.01% ( 10% ) of the decay energy to escape at 75d ( 180d ) after explosion ( section  [ sect_lbol_ldecay ] ) .",
    "further , since lte holds below the photosphere , the bolometric luminosity is insensitive to how the  energy is downgraded . thus , our synthetic bolometric light curves are strictly accurate over at least two months after explosion .",
    "starting our non - lte time - dependent simulations at a post - breakout time of @xmath51d , our synthetic bolometric luminosities initially decline from the peak value reached at shock breakout . the early post - breakout fading stems from energy losses associated with radiation and expansion ( the latter being particularly significant for compact progenitor stars ) , causing a tremendous cooling of the ejecta . in our simulations",
    "this rapid bolometric fading is largely missed  we catch mostly the end of it at 12d .",
    "the luminosity then levels off at a value of 15@xmath210@xmath3  and initiates a short plateau ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lbol_all ] ) .",
    "this plateau extends in all models over a number of days before the sn either brightens or fades .",
    "brightening is initiated in our -rich models bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , and bmi25mf5p09z1 as soon as the photosphere  feels \" the influence of the heat wave generated from the decay of radioactive nuclei ( primarily  to ) at greater depths .",
    "the re - brightening is delayed in model bmi25mf5p09z1 because its ejecta mass is larger and the -rich layers are located deeper ( @xmath51250 )  both increase the diffusion time for the energy released at depth .",
    "in contrast , sample objects without  eventually , and irrevocably , fade at @xmath010d after exploding .",
    "this time is about the same as the time of re - brightening in the -rich models , and in some sense , is quite degenerate given the range of ejecta masses in our sample .",
    "the models that re - brighten reach a peak luminosity at about 30 - 50d after shock breakout , before fading to a luminosity corresponding to the energy decay rate of @xmath12co to @xmath12fe ( recall that we currently assume full - trapping of  in these cmfgen calculations ) .",
    "this general light - curve morphology , discussed in a similar context by @xcite , is well known and generally reflects the evolution of the photospheric properties , which we show in figs .",
    "[ fig_phot_all][fig_phot_comp ] .",
    "the modest increase in radius combined with the large decrease in temperature at the photosphere cause the luminosity to drop after breakout .",
    "the plateau arises when the temperature decrease at the photosphere slows down , which is associated with the recombination of ejecta layers to their neutral state ( primarily he , but also cno elements in such w - r progenitor stars ) .",
    "@xcite obtain a similar early post - breakout plateau in all their simulations . for reference",
    ", we also show in the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_all ] the time evolution of the ejecta electron - scattering optical depth , which tend to drop faster than 1/time@xmath17 due to changes in ionization .",
    "this figure also serves to identify the time at which each of the ejecta becomes optically thin .",
    "free of any decay heating at early times , the evolution of the outer ejecta is essentially adiabatic ( modulo radiative cooling near the photosphere ) , and thus ejecta internal energy is lost ( and ionization state reduced ) to @xmath18 work primarily .",
    "what primarily determines the plateau brightness is therefore the amount of energy initially deposited by the shock and the size of the progenitor envelope .",
    "the former is modulated by the differential rate of ejecta expansion between models .",
    "given the uniform ejecta kinetic energy in our sample ( 1 or 1.2b ) , and the rough inverse correlation of size with ejecta mass for our limited set of models , models with smaller ejecta mass tend to have a larger plateau brightness ( e.g. , model bmi18mf3p79z1 has the largest kinetic energy per unit ejecta mass and the largest post - breakout plateau brightness ) .",
    "the latter is connected to the progenitor - envelope binding energy , which we show for a few models in fig .",
    "[ fig_eb ] .",
    "objects that have brighter post - breakout plateaus are those with the least bound outer envelopes . because of stellar evolution , these also tend to be more helium rich ( greater enrichments in c / o testify for a greater proximity to the more tightly bound and hotter regions of the progenitor core where nuclear reactions take place ) .",
    "consequently , ejecta produced both from a larger mass and a more compact progenitor star are the faintest of all during the short early - time plateau .",
    "the early - time plateau is not always strictly flat but instead may slant up or down .",
    "this seems to correlate directly to the depth variation of the ejecta helium abundance ( and the associated recombination energy ) and of the corresponding progenitor - envelope binding energy .",
    "if the helium mass fraction is constant with depth ( or if the progenitor - envelope binding energy varies little with depth ) , the sn luminosity is constant or increases , while if the helium mass fraction decreases with depth ( or if the progenitor - envelope binding energy increases steeply with depth ) , the luminosity ebbs .",
    "the main kinks in helium mass fraction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_comp ] thus correspond to points of inflection in the light curves of fig .",
    "[ fig_lbol_all ] . in all -deficient models ,",
    "the precipitous fading at @xmath010d coincides with the sudden decrease of the helium mass fraction at the photosphere , and its recession to the oxygen - rich , originally more tightly - bound , ejecta layers .",
    "we find that the plateau is shorter for outer ejecta having a larger mean - atomic weight , because of the lower effective opacity and the greater original binding - energy ( in absolute terms ) of the corresponding layers .    at the time of re - brightening in -rich models ,",
    "the heat wave from decay energy at depth causes the photospheric temperature to reverse its decrease and to rise .",
    "this rise causes a modest change to the ionisation , but helium remains essentially neutral at the photosphere ( at later times , non - thermal ionisation , which we neglect , could alter this ionisation state ) .",
    "however , the recombination wave is slowed down and the photosphere recedes much more slowly in velocity space in models bmi18mf3p79z1 and bmi18mf4p40z1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_all ] ) . during the rise to peak brightness ,",
    "the photospheric velocity decreases by no more than a few percent .",
    "because velocity relates to mass in sn ejecta , this implies that the photosphere probes the same region of the ejecta during that time . in model bmi25mf5p09z1 ,",
    "the influence of the delayed heat wave is much stronger and causes the photosphere to move out in velocity from 4000 to 5400  ( equivalent to an outward shift in mass of 0.6 ) .    at the onset of re - brightening",
    "the photosphere has receded through the very rich he - rich shell .",
    "while as much as @xmath550% of the ejecta mass may have passed through the photosphere , the photosphere is still well outside of the -rich regions .",
    "the re - brightening , and rise to peak , thus stems from the heat wave triggered by radioactive decay heating at greater depth . because the   are subject to a large optical depth at such early times , this diffusing heat wave will always reach the photosphere before direct heating by  can occur .",
    "more generally , diffusion of heat from the site of radioactive decay seems to be the cause of post - breakout re - brightening in all sn ii - pec / iib / ib / ic progenitors .",
    "as the re - brigthening phase continues , the photosphere recedes through the he - c - o region which is still he dominant , although in bmi25mf5p09z1 he , c , and o have comparable mass - fractions . at the time of peak brightness",
    "the photosphere is at the base of this he - c - o shell , and is entering the oxygen - rich core .",
    "interestingly , the light curve of the -rich model bmi25mf5p09z1 qualitatively follows the early evolution of -deficient models , with the onset of a fading at 57d as the photosphere leaves the helium - rich regions of the ejecta .",

    "this suggests that such low amounts of hydrogen do not influence sizeably the radiative - transfer solution , but can alter the sn classification .",

    "this stems here from chemical stratification , with hydrogen being absent in all ejecta mass shells with a velocity @xmath510000 . in the present context , and if helium lines strengthened at later times , this event would accurately be classified as a type iib .",
    "the evolution of balmer lines reflects in part the ionisation conditions at and above the photosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_comp ] ) .",
    "as time progresses , the regions in the vicinity of the photosphere recombine and cool , photoionisation / recombination rates decrease , so that the balmer lines eventually weaken .",
    "this is mitigated at large radii / velocities by an ionisation freeze - out which stems from time - dependent effects @xcite .",
    "the arrival of the heat wave at the photosphere at @xmath08d after explosion raises the hydrogen ionisation and causes the hydrogen - recombination front to travel outwards in velocity / mass .",
    "because hydrogen is under - abundant in those ejecta regions , it does not reverse the recession of the photosphere to deeper ejecta layers , since helium , the dominant species there , continues to recombine .",

    "the h  lines are predicted for up to @xmath010d _ in the absence of non - thermal processes _ and more generally without any need for .",
    "h@xmath6 , the strongest balmer line we predict , is strong at early times but considerably weakens as time goes on , so that its unambiguous identification can only be done at early times . at later times , it may still be present but this will be conditioned by multiple , complicated , and sometimes largely unconstrained effects .",
    "these include mixing ,  production and distribution , ejecta mass , chemical - stratification etc ... further , its identification will be compromised by overlap with numerous and potentially stronger lines .",
    "obviously , obtaining very early - time spectra alleviates all these issues and can set a firm constraint on the properties of the progenitor star .",

    "however , these early explorations employed radiative - transfer simulations that did not include all the relevant physics , in particular lacked a rigorous treatment of non - lte effects . in the context of sn 1987a , @xcite and @xcite were also unable to reproduce the he  lines at 1 - 2d after explosion , and obviously , non - thermal processes could not be the culprit .",
    "this he  discrepancy has now been resolved , although at a great computational cost , with the use of a full non - lte treatment @xcite , demonstrating the need for a fully - consistent solution of the radiative - transfer problem .",

    "for example , he  lines are present up until peak brightness at @xmath030d in model bmi18mf3p79z1 because at that time the helium mass fraction at the photosphere is still @xmath00.8 and the diffusing heat from decay enhances the gas temperature at the photosphere to @xmath010000k . in model bmi25mf5p09z1 , at 30d after explosion , the helium mass fraction at the photosphere is down to @xmath00.5 and the heat from decay , shared by a greater mass , is also diffusing out more slowly ( fig .",

    "the notion that one needs he10830  to unambiguously assess the presence or absence of helium is partially supported by our simulations . at early times , whenever he10830  is present , he5875   is present too and should be identifiable . at @xmath010d , however , he5875  tends to become very weak while he10830  may still be strong and more easily identifiable .",

    "of course , the presence ( and dominance ) of helium does condition the radiative - transfer solution ( for example , helium ionisation controls the location of the photosphere ) .",

    "our results also imply that a significant amount of helium may be present in the outer regions of the ejecta without any clear radiative signature .",
    "recall that we are ignoring non - thermal processes , which could help produce he  lines when we do not predict them .",
    "however , in those cases where we do predict them , such processes would only make he  lines stronger .      with more erosion of the progenitor star and/or helium core ,",

    "it is thus important to search for radiative signatures of such cno elements .",
    "as expected , those ( single - star ) models that do not show any he  line for the first 10d show a wealth of lines from c  and o  in the red part of the optical range , while only very few and weak lines are associated with nitrogen ( i.e. , n ; figs .  [ fig_spec1][fig_spec2 ] ) .",

    "in contrast , sne associated with -bursts ( grbs ) , e.g. , sn 1998bw @xcite or sn 2010bh @xcite , have a well defined explosion time , but in these , the object seems to be always brightening at @xmath41d after the grb signal .",
    "sn 2008d was caught as the shock broke out of the progenitor star @xcite . by 1d after breakout , the luminosity plateaus , but already by 5d the sn re - brightens .",
    "interestingly , it brightens by merely 1mag to reach a peak before fading again .",
    "the post - breakout plateau that we discuss here seems to have been seen in sn 2008d , but lasts for a few days only and has a a brightness that is merely 1mag below the peak .",
    "this small post - breakout - plateau / peak brightness contrast is in part caused by the faint light - curve peak , supporting a smaller - than - average  mass of @xmath00.07  @xcite , compared to @xmath00.2   in our models .",
    "the short post - breakout plateau suggests that the ejecta mass is small and/or mixing quite efficient .",
    "the huge plateau brightness of @xmath01.5@xmath210@xmath24   @xcite is , however , perplexing .",
    "this plateau brightness is thrice that obtained in our simulations",
    ". it can not be due to a large progenitor radius since analysis of the early x - ray light curve @xcite supports a progenitor radius of @xmath30 .",
    "efficient outward mixing of would enhance the brightness , but it would likely induce a brightening rather than a plateau , and is therefore not the likely explanation . some light contamination could come from the galaxy host , although it appears unlikely here since sn 2008d was followed up to very late times when the sn was visually much fainter than immediately after breakout .",
    "the contamination could come from the sn light itself , but emitted earlier and scattered by the surrounding csm or pre - sn mass loss .",
    "the lack of narrow lines from photo - ionised and/or shocked csm gas in sn 2008d early - time spectra does not strongly support this .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argued for a low mass rate for the sn 2008d progenitor w - r star .",
    "following upon the argument that the sn 2008d progenitor star may be in a binary system , the large early post - breakout luminosity could in part arise from the collision of the sn ejecta with the companion star @xcite .",
    "the same argument could also explain the early light curve of sn 1993j , which in current models requires a low - mass h - poor and he - rich progenitor with a surprisingly large radius of @xmath4630  @xcite .",
    "early - time light curves , starting immediately after breakout , may therefore provide an important clue to the single / binary status of the progenitor star , and complement independent constraints set by the outer - ejecta composition ( section  [ sect_spec ] ) .    compared to the progenitor w - r stars , which emit the bulk of the radiation in the uv , the post - breakout plateau should be @xmath410mag brighter in the @xmath31-band ( @xcite ; this estimate accounts for the large bolometric correction of w - r stars )",
    ". this enormous visual brightening might still be difficult to detect if the sn is located in a crowded region or if it falls on the galaxy light .",
    "for sne located at large galactocentric radii , it should however be possible , provided the search is deep and performed on a daily cadence .      in nature ,  mixing within sn iib / ib / ic ejecta will be more efficient than in our set of -rich models , which assume no mixing at all . our neglect of non - thermal processes will affect the gas ionisation and compromise our synthetic colors at peak , which are thus not discussed in this comparison to observations . we thus discuss instead the bolometric properties .",
    "our -rich models bmi18mf3p79z1 and bmi18mf4p41z1 show a 20-d rise time from the post - breakout plateau to the peak , whose bolometric magnitude is -17.89 and -17.64 and bolometric luminosity of 1.14@xmath210@xmath32 and 9.0@xmath210@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "these trends reflect the larger  mass in the former model ( 0.184 compared to 0.170 ) combined with the larger ejecta mass in the latter ( 2.39 compared to 2.91 ) .",
    "importantly ,  is present out to the same ejecta velocity in both .",
    "in contrast , the bolometric light curve for model bmi25mf5p09z1 has a longer rise time of 40d from the end of the post - breakout plateau , with a peak bolometric magnitude ( luminosity ) of -17.49 ( 7.9@xmath210@xmath24 ) . here , despite the larger  mass of 0.24 ,",
    "the peak is fainter than for the other two -rich models because of the larger ejecta mass and the significantly deeper location of , i.e. below 1250  compared to below @xmath42500 .",
    "furthermore , a larger ejecta mass and a deeper location of  broadens the peak width significantly .",
    "fifteen days after the light curve peak , we obtain a magnitude fading of 0.82 , 0.57 , and 0.15 for models bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , and bmi25mf5p09z1 .",
    "modulations in ejecta mass and  mixing can be interchanged to yield similar results . in a separate set of simulations for these three progenitors but",
    "characterised by a  extent out to 3500 , all three models yielded similar light curve widths . in sne",
    "ibc light - curve modelling , mixing is usually adjusted freely to obtain a good match but we see here that there is a fundamental degeneracy in the problem .",
    "this requires an alternate constraint on mixing , which can only come from spectra .",
    "overall , our results agree with those of @xcite when adopting similar ejecta characteristics . our main characteristics for models bmi18mf3p79z1 and bmi18mf4p41z1 are in good agreement with the observations and estimates recently published by @xcite and based on a large sample of sne ibc multi - color light curves ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the sn post - peak / nebular luminosity is understood to be powered by radioactive decay , and primarily that of  at the times of interest here ( we consider explosions that synthesise primarily ) . in sne ii ,",
    "the large ejecta mass of typically 10 - 15  ensures the full trapping of  for a few hundred days .",
    "however , in type i sne , the lower ejecta mass is less efficient at trapping , which can escape earlier ( for a similar phenomenon in the context of sne ia , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "how much earlier , and how efficiently , are a very important question , since it connects to the ejecta mass and location of .",
    "the post - peak / nebular - phase luminosity decline rate represents an important diagnostic for the explosion and the progenitor star . because  are insensitive to the gas ionisation state and composition ( provided only elements heavier than helium are present ) ,  transport is considerably simpler than optical - photon transport and less subject to uncertainty .",
    "the majority of sne iib / ib / ic show post - peak luminosity decline rates that are steeper than the expected rate of 0.01mag / d for full  trapping @xcite .",
    "@xcite invoked the effect of clumping .",
    "departures from sphericity or efficient intrinsic mixing may also propel further out ( see , for example , @xcite ) , which would then increase  escape during the nebular phase .",
    "unfortunately , the emblematic sn 1987a , for which there is strong evidence of an asymmetric explosion and for which early escape is inferred , shows a nebular - luminosity fading rate that exactly matches the 0.01mag / d decline rate that implies full trapping @xcite . as alluded to above , a systematically low ejecta mass combined with moderate mixing may alone explain the generically fast decline rate of sne iib / ib / ic .    in the cmfgen simulations we have presented so far ,  decay energy , when included ,",
    "was fully deposited at the site of release in the ejecta . with this full - trapping assumption ,",
    "our corresponding models fade at a 0.01mag / d at nebular times . to check how the light curve may be affected by this approximation",
    ", we have developed a -transport monte carlo code that computes the fraction of  that escape , and of those that are trapped , how they distribute their energy within the ejecta ( hillier & dessart , in preparation ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_lbol_ldecay ] , we show results based on our -rich ejecta models bmi18mf3p79z1 , bmi18mf4p41z1 , and bmi25mf5p09z1 ( and assuming spherical symmetry ) . we find that the smaller the ejecta mass ( for the same ejecta kinetic energy , here of 1.2b ) , the earlier the fading rate departs from the rate for full - trapping and the steeper the luminosity fades subsequently .    in models bmi18mf3p79z1 and bmi25mf4p41z1 , the post - peak luminosity curve smoothly joins the steep nebular decline , because the  start escaping immediately at the fall off from the peak.500d after explosion .",
    "the steeper decline of the sn 1987a bolometric luminosity occurs at that time @xcite , but unfortunately this is concomitant with dust formation in the sn 1987a ejecta @xcite , which may be responsible for part of the inferred attenuation . ]",
    "the subsequent fading is very steep , and compatible with the decline rate of sne ib / ic @xcite .",
    "however , in model bmi25mf5p09z1 , full - trapping persists at the onset of the nebular phase and it is only later that  escape occurs and becomes noticeable .",
    "there is thus a point of inflection at 130d in the bolometric luminosity when full - trapping ceases to hold .",
    "observations do not seem to support such late trapping , but instead suggest at least some moderate level of mixing . in model bmi25mf5p09z1 , adopting some mixing of  out to 3000  ( instead of 1250 ) moves the onset of  leakage to 70d after explosion .    in the observations of sne 1993j @xcite , 1994i @xcite , or 1998bw @xcite ,",
    "the post - breakout re - brightening occurred very soon after breakout , the peak was reached very early , the rise and fall from the peak occurred over a short time , and the decline rate was faster than for full - trapping .",
    "all these independently support the notion , which is not new , that sne iib / ib / ic are associated with low - mass ejecta , and quite generally low - mass progenitor stars .",
    "however , it may be that rather than invoking extreme clumping or mixing configurations , one may be able to accommodate such observations with moderate mixing and low - mass ejecta exclusively . in the context of hypernovae , associated or not with a  signal ,",
    "the larger ejecta expansion rate reduces the diffusion time and enhances the probability of  escape , so that a larger mass may still be compatible with the observations . in the future , to address this issue , we will model simultaneously , in the fashion described here , the spectra and light curves of these rare events .",
    "our early - time synthetic seds look like that of a cool thermal emitter , with a peak distribution around 5000 , and affected by numerous weak / strong lines from h / he / c / n / o and ime as well as forests of lines from blanketing species and in particular iron .",
    "the main results from our work are that hydrogen and/or helium lines are predicted _ even in the absence of non - thermal processes _ , or heat diffusion , caused by radioactive decay .",
    "h  balmer lines are seen for a hydrogen mass fraction as low as 0.01 in the corresponding ejecta layers , while he  lines seem guaranteed only if the helium mass fraction is close to 100% . during the rise to peak , decay heating may be strong enough to produce he  lines , which may persist until the peak of the light curve in spite of the much lower helium mass fraction at the photosphere at that time .",
    "such early - time observations ( spectra and light curves ) are critical since during the post - breakout plateau , up to @xmath550% of the ejecta mass may have gone through the photosphere , and thus potentially be unaccounted for .    there is a scarcity of sn iib / ib / ic spectroscopic observations at early times , prior to the post - breakout re - brightening . indeed , the first spectra are typically taken during the rise to peak , which is a phase influenced indirectly by radioactive decay ( an outward - diffusing heat wave ) .",
    "the only exceptions with early - time observations are sne 1993j ( iib ) and 2008d ( ib ) .",
    "numerous investigations have studied the light curve or the spectra , but none have performed the full non - lte time - dependent radiative - transfer simulation of the ejecta , with the approach presented here .",
    "it is critical to do both at the same time , to test that the  mixing adopted to fit the light curve is also compatible with the excitation / ionisation seen in spectra .",
    "this has never been done .",
    "our models were not tailored to match any specific observation so we can not be quantitative .",
    "qualitatively speaking , our model bmi18mf3p79z1 has some analogy with the early observations of sn 1993j ( e.g. , the presence of a strong h@xmath6 line ) .",
    "we note that the early - time sn 1993j spectra are nearly featureless and rather blue @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , this has been associated in former studies with the explosion of an extended low - mass progenitor in a binary system @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the large early - time flux could in a large part stem from the collision of the sn ejecta with the identified companion of sn 1993j s progenitor star @xcite , which would call for a significant revision of current models of the event .",
    "in model bmi18mf3p79z1 , the pre - sn star has a radius of 10  and the early - time spectra are consequently rather red ( the photosphere is cool and recombined ) , not blue , and line blanketing is strong .",
    "irrespective of the mismatches with observations , we do concur with previous investigations that low - hydrogen mass fractions and low - hydrogen integral mass at the progenitor surface are sufficient to produce a strong ( and broad ) h@xmath6 line in the corresponding early - time sn iib spectra , as observed in 93j @xcite .",
    "none of our models match the observations of sn 2008d during the first week after explosion .",
    "given our results for hydrogen , it is clear that 08d is hydrogen - deficient .",
    "however , at early times , the observed spectra are nearly featureless , as for sn 1993j , while our simulations predict he  or fe  lines for such a sn ib event .",
    "one striking property of sn 2008d is that the early post - breakout plateau is about three times as bright as that of sn 1987a and only @xmath51mag fainter than the light - curve peak .",
    "sn 2008d is much brighter at those early times than expected for a rather compact w - r - star progenitor .",
    "together with the nearly featureless spectra , these properties suggest that the sn light is indeed  corrupted \" . as discussed above , an attractive solution to this",
    "is emission from the collision of the sn ejecta with a companion star @xcite .    at the time of re - brightening in model bmi18mf3p79z1",
    ", the heat wave causes the appearance of a kink in the h@xmath6 absorption .",
    "if stronger , the corresponding change in ionisation could have led to a reversal of the doppler velocity of maximum absorption in h@xmath6 . in model bmi25mf5p09z1 ,",
    "the effects of the heat wave is very pronounced and causes the photosphere to move out mass , or velocity , space .",
    "however , it occurs too late to leave any imprint onto he  lines . the velocity reversal in the he5875  line of sn 2005bf @xcite may stem from a similar circumstance , but in this case at a time when the photosphere is close to helium - rich layers .",
    "the origin of this unique observation may be the birth of a magnetar @xcite .",
    "in general , such reversals / kinks / notches are not observed because sne iib / ib / ic are discovered too late ( during the rise to the peak ) , at a time when the photosphere is already in the vicinity of the core .",
    "it is a dramatic change in heating / excitation / ionisation conditions that permits this reversal , such as when the photosphere starts feeling the energy from decay or , in exceptional circumstances , from the magnetar radiation .",
    "our -deficient models can not be compared to observations since all sne iib / ib / ic are discovered by the virtue of being  rich . however , this could stem from the current bias for the discovery of brighter objects in bright galaxies , making objects devoid of a post - breakout re - brightening impossible to detect .",
    "future deep and un - targeted surveys may in fact discover -deficient core - collapse sn explosions , and if they do so , it will be either through the breakout signal or the post - breakout plateau . as discussed in this paper ,",
    "the radiative signatures during that phase are conditioned by the properties of the progenitor outer envelope .",
    "if detected , they would provide important information on the progenitor and perhaps clues on what distinguishes progenitors that explode as bright or faint supernovae , despite having a standard ejecta - kinetic energy of 1b .",
    "we have presented non - lte time - dependent radiative - transfer simulations of sn ejecta , with and without -decay products , resulting from the core - collapse explosions of single and binary w - r stars evolved at solar and sub - solar metallicity .",
    "our approach allows the simultaneous computation of the spectra and light curves , and is comparable to our earlier studies of sn 1987a @xcite and sne ii - p @xcite .",
    "we pay particular attention to binary - star models for the production of sne iib / ib / ic , using the physically - consistent calculations of @xcite .",
    "this work contains about 400 separate calculations performed in separate time sequences , each time taking typically 1 - 2 days of computing , from which we infer the following :    1 .",
    "all our sne go through a @xmath010-d - long post - breakout plateau with a luminosity of 15@xmath210@xmath3 , which is optically @xmath010mag brighter than its progenitor . in models",
    "endowed with 0.170.24  of  initially , this plateau is followed by a 20 - 30d re - brightening phase up to a peak luminosity of 8 to 10@xmath210@xmath24 .",
    "assuming full  trapping , the nebular - luminosity decline rate of such ejecta agrees with the expected rate for  decay .",
    "however ,  escape in our low - mass ejecta with moderate  mixing becomes effective at @xmath070d after explosion and lead to a much faster fading rate of @xmath00.02mag / d .",
    "the absence of a sizeable post - breakout plateau , the narrow peak width , and the fast nebular - luminosity decline rate of most observed sne iib / ib / ic light curves may be explained by a revision downward of their associated ejecta mass ( as well as of the ejecta kinetic energy to retain the same ejecta kinetic energy per unit mass).10b - kinetic - energy ejecta to address this issue . ]",
    "this may be more physically justifiable than invoking strong clumping , efficient mixing to the progenitor surface , or extreme asymmetry of the explosion in the form of a  jet \" .",
    "observing the post - breakout plateau and the post - peak luminosity decline rate of all sne iib / ib / ic is key to further constrain this issue .",
    "we find that by the time of re - brightening , up to half the ejecta mass has gone through the photosphere .",
    "studies on sne iib / ib / ic based on peak and post - peak observations exclusively are thus subject to major shortcomings , since they miss important information on the outer - ejecta properties , and in particular the h / he composition and the total ejecta mass .",
    "4 .   we present results for our w - r explosions with standard ejecta kinetic - energy but no explosively synthesised .",
    "these models go through a similar post - breakout plateau but irrevocably fade away as the photosphere recedes to helium - deficient inner regions , at about 10d after explosion .",
    "hydrogen present with a small mass fraction of @xmath00.01 and a small cumulative mass of @xmath40.001gives rise to h  balmer lines and in particular strong h@xmath6 in our wn - star progenitor models over the period 1 - 10d . as latter times",
    "only h@xmath6 remains .",
    "however , it is weak and broad which , combined with possible overlap by c  and si  lines , makes its identification difficult .",
    "observed spectroscopically a few days after shock breakout , these events would eventually be classified as type iib sne ( and correspond to the sne ciib of @xcite ) , and probably as type ib sne otherwise . to address this issue , it is critical to obtain early - time spectra , preferably before the time of re - brightening ( which may be caused by the recession of the photosphere to deeper , possibly h - deficient , ejecta layers ) .",
    "using spectra taken at the peak of the light curve can hardly help resolve this problem since the photosphere may be a solar mass below the progenitor surface at that time .",
    "simulations based on binary - star w - r ( i.e. wn ) progenitor models that have an helium mass fraction of @xmath495% in the outer @xmath01of the ejecta show he  lines throughout their post - breakout plateau phase , _ irrespective of the absence / presence of _ . past the end of the plateau , some models still show he  lines , even though our decay energy is treated as a pure local heat / thermal source .",
    "non - thermal excitation / ionisation is however key to strengthen he  lines further , as observed . in general , the he10830  is stronger , broader , and longer lived than other he  lines like he5875 .",

    "our simulations of w - r - star explosions at low metallicity show weaker metal lines , and in particular those from fe . because spectra of sne iib / ib / ic taken prior to or at the time of re - brightening are unaffected by the explosively nucleo - synthesised metals , quantitative spectroscopy of early - time sn observations may offer a powerful and accurate means to directly infer the metallicity of the primordial gas from which the progenitor of the snt formed .",

    "<S> we present non - lte time - dependent radiative - transfer simulations of supernova ( sn ) iib / ib / ic spectra and light curves , based on @xmath010@xmath1erg piston - driven ejecta , with and without , produced from single and binary wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars evolved at solar and sub - solar metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> our bolometric light curves show a 10-day long post - breakout plateau with a luminosity of 1 - 5@xmath210@xmath3 , visually brighter by @xmath410mag than the progenitor w - r star . in our -rich models , with @xmath03  ejecta masses , this plateau precedes a 20 to 30-day long re - brightening phase initiated by the outward - diffusing heat wave powered by radioactive decay at depth . </S>",
    "<S> a larger ejecta mass or a deeper  location increases the heat diffusion time and acts to both delay and broaden the light - curve peak . </S>",
    "<S> discriminating between the two effects requires spectroscopic modelling . in low ejecta - mass models with moderate mixing ,  </S>",
    "<S> leakage starts as early as @xmath050d after explosion and causes the nebular luminosity to steeply decline by @xmath00.02mag / d . </S>",
    "<S> such signatures , which are observed in standard sne iib / ib / ic , are consistent with low - mass progenitors derived from a binary - star population . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the majority of stars with an initial mass @xmath520  yield sne ii - p if  effectively \" single , sne iib / ib / ic if part of a close binary system , and sn - less black holes if more massive . </S>",
    "<S> our ejecta , with outer hydrogen mass fractions as low as @xmath40.01 and a total hydrogen mass of @xmath40.001 , yield the characteristic sn iib spectral morphology at early times . </S>",
    "<S> however at later times , @xmath015d after the explosion , only h@xmath6 may remain as a weak absorption feature . </S>",
    "<S> our binary models , characterised by helium surface mass fractions of @xmath40.85 , systematically show he  lines during the post - breakout plateau , irrespective of the  abundance . </S>",
    "<S> synthetic spectra show a strong sensitivity to metallicity , which offers the possibility to constrain it directly from sn spectroscopic modelling .    </S>",
