    "observations of unbiased , flux - limited galaxy samples via ` blank - field ' extragalactic surveys have been a mainstay in the field of galaxy formation and evolution for several decades , with the well - known hubble deep field @xcite and sloan digital sky survey @xcite exemplifying two very different types of galaxy survey .",
    "extending the wavelength coverage as broadly as possible has led to numerous changes in the understanding of how galaxies form , evolve , and interact over cosmic time .",
    "new technologies and larger telescopes continually increase the volume of discovery space , making some ` state - of - the - art ' observations obsolete in just a few years .",
    "the locations of extragalactic survey fields are driven by a number of considerations . to achieve the deepest possible data ,",
    "foreground diffuse emission and absorption should be low .",
    "relevant properties include galactic h  i column density ( particularly important for x  ray observations ) , galactic and ecliptic dust and ` cirrus ' foreground emission ( particularly important for infrared observations ) , schedulability ( for observability by space - based telescopes ) , and a lack of extremely bright foreground sources such as stars or nearby galaxies .",
    "there is of course a trade - off between ecliptic latitude and declination ; high - latitude fields are less easily observable from both hemispheres .",
    "the extended groth strip ( egs ) , centered at @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is observable only from the north but has excellent properties in other categories and as such is one of a handful of premier extragalactic survey fields .",
    "observations of the egs have now been made at nearly every wavelength , with a number of projects ( including the _ spitzer _ legacy project fidel ) still ongoing .",
    "many of the datasets in the egs region are described briefly by @xcite ; the same journal issue contains the results of initial studies using the multi - wavelength dataset . as part of a public data release by the aegis collaboration , this paper describes observations of the egs made with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite and presents a catalog derived from those data .",
    "irac is sensitive to radiation nearly out of reach for ground - based telescopes .",
    "it was designed in part to study galaxies at high redshift ; its four bands at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m  probe the peak of the galaxy spectral energy distribution out to redshifts of @xmath4 . early results from the _ spitzer _ mission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) established that irac could indeed detect @xmath5 galaxies , and lensed sources at much higher redshifts ( @xmath6 ) have also been detected @xcite .",
    "the population of galaxies detected with the mips instrument on spitzer @xcite have been well - characterized @xcite , as have the irac sources detected in shallow surveys such as swire @xcite and the botes field @xcite . however , the irac sources detected in deep observations such as those made of the egs ( 90 times the exposure time of swire ) or the goods fields ( 1500 times the exposure time ) have only begun to be explored ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this paper presents the irac egs catalog and an examination of the source population ; a companion paper ( huang et al . , 2008 , in prep . )",
    "describes the use of the irac data in combination with optical data to derive photometric redshifts .",
    "other recent papers by the irac team have used the egs data to derive number counts @xcite , define a class of infrared luminous lyman - break galaxies @xcite , explore the mid - infrared properties of x  ray sources @xcite , identify mid - infrared counterparts to sub - millimeter sources @xcite , investigate the contribution of mid - infrared sources to the sub - millimeter background @xcite , measure stellar masses for @xmath7 lyman - break galaxies @xcite , and identify 6  cm radio sources @xcite .",
    "the irac instrument was described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the irac observations of the egs were carried out as part of _ spitzer _ guaranteed time observing program number 8 , using about 165 hours of time contributed by _ spitzer _ science working group members g.  fazio , g.  rieke , and e.  wright .",
    "the observations were performed in two epochs , 2003 december and 2004 june / july .",
    "( source variability between the two epochs is under analysis and will be discussed in a future contribution . )",
    "each epoch s observations consisted of 26 astronomical observing requests ( aors ) with each aor implemented as a 2 column ( across the width of the strip ) by 1 row map having 26 dithered 200  s exposuresm  irac band , each 200  s exposure is implemented as four 50  s exposures . ] per map position .",
    "the dither pattern used was the medium - scale cycling pattern , which has a median separation of 53 pixels ( @xmath8 ) and includes half - pixel offsets .",
    "the central positions of the maps were defined to align with the egs position angle , 40  east of north .",
    "since the _ spitzer _ roll - angle is not selectable by the observer , the correct orientation of the irac arrays ( aligned with the egs ) was accomplished by constraining the observation dates .",
    "each epoch s aors were observed in order from south to north along the egs to minimize roll angle changes between adjacent aors and prevent gaps . because the array position angles changed by 180  between the two epochs , and because irac has two separate fields of view offset by 5 , there are regions at the ends of the egs with only single - epoch coverage in one field of view . to summarize , the irac observations comprise 52 positions in a @xmath9 map , and at each position there are 52 dithered 200  s exposures at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  @xmath1 m and 208 dithered 50  s exposures taken concurrently at 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "the processed dataset includes 18924 basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images : only 4 of the expected frames were lost to pipeline problems .",
    "data processing began with the bcd images produced by version 14 of the spitzer science center irac pipeline .",
    "individual frames were corrected for the ` muxbleed ' and ` pulldown ' artifacts near bright stars by fitting and subtracting a straight line ( counts as a function of pixel number ) to the affected pixels .",
    "this somewhat crude correction reduced pulldown to a level below the noise , but some muxbleed trails are still apparent in the output mosaics .",
    "the known variation in point source calibration over the irac arrays field of view @xcite was not corrected for : doing so would have compromised outlier detection during mosaicing and resulted in non - flat backgrounds in the final mosaics which would have greatly complicated source detection . because the irac exposures are well - dithered , the magnitude of this effect should be @xmath10% ( see the irac data handbook ) .",
    "irac photometry is known to vary slightly with source position within a pixel , but this effect is @xmath11% and should also average out of the highly - dithered egs data .",
    "the saturation limits for the mosaics are the same as those in individual 200  s frames : 2  mjy ( @xmath12 ) at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m , and 14  mjy ( @xmath13 ) at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "mosaicing was done using custom idl scripts supplemented with procedures from the idl astronomy library . a reference frame containing all the input frames in each band",
    "was constructed , and a grid of output pixels defined .",
    "the linear dimensions of the output pixels were half those of the input pixels .",
    "the individual input frames were distortion - corrected and projected onto the grid of output pixels using bi - linear interpolation , then the pixel stack at each output pixel was combined by averaging with @xmath14-clipping .",
    "this sigma - clipping served to reject cosmic rays , scattered light , and other image artifacts .",
    "rejection of array row- and column - based artifacts was facilitated by having the observations done at two different position angles , but some artifacts remain in the final mosaics .",
    "the method used to remove these from the catalog is described in  [ sec : sourceid ] .",
    "after mosaics in the 4 individual irac bands were constructed , they were transformed to a common pixel scale and reference frame using version 2.16.0 of the swarp software written by e. bertin , retrieved from the terapix website .",
    "the final mosaics are @xmath15 , with a pixel size ( @xmath16 ) about half the native irac pixel scale ( 122 ) .",
    "the mosaicing and resampling conserved surface brightness , so the mosaics , like the input bcd images , are in units of  mjy  sr@xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows a portion of the mosaics in each band .",
    "the mosaics , coverage images , and psf star images ( see below ) are available online from http://www.cfa.harvard.edu / irac / egs/.    because of dithering the coverage varies over the mosaics ; the median coverage is about 47 frames ( 9100  s ) in all channels .",
    "the number of frames co - added at each position was recorded during processing , and a cumulative plot of the exposure time per pixel is shown in figure  [ fig : coverage ] .",
    "pixels with lower coverage depth are in the ` crust ' near the edges of the mosaic , and the small fraction of pixels with significantly higher coverage are located along the center line where different map positions overlap . within the deep coverage area ,",
    "the coverage differs slightly between the irac bands due to the differing fields of view and appearance of artifacts .",
    "( for example , cosmic ray hits affect more pixels in the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m  bands , but bright - source artifacts affect more pixels in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m  bands ) .",
    "the inflection points in the coverage curves are at areas / depths of 1440  arcmin@xmath0/1900  s and 930  arcmin@xmath0/9100  s. about 100  arcmin@xmath0 is covered to depths of @xmath18  s , but this deepest area is not contiguous .",
    "measuring the point spread functions ( psfs ) of the mosaics is important for quantifying the distribution of light within individual sources .",
    "a ` psf star image ' was constructed in each band using the ssc prf_estimate software ( v. 030106 ) to combine ` postage stamp ' images of bright sources ( ranging from 50 sources at 8.0  @xmath1 m  to 350 at 3.6  @xmath1 m ) in the mosaics . although the psf is known to vary over the irac field of view , this effect is smoothed over in mosaicing , and in any case the variation was not important for our purposes .",
    "the medians and standard deviations of photometry offsets between small measurement apertures and the irac calibration photometry aperture of 122 were computed over the ensembles of bright sources ; these are given in table  [ tab : apcor ] .",
    "the aperture corrections derived here compare reasonably well with those found by other groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particularly for the larger apertures where the uncertainties are smaller .",
    "computing photometric uncertainties requires a good understanding of image noise properties .",
    "noise in the mosaics comes from several sources .",
    "the most fundamental is photon shot noise from the zodiacal foreground , which for measurements in small beams is a factor of 30 smaller than the catalog limit at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m  and a factor of 10 smaller at 5.8 and 8.0  .",
    "another noise contributor is source confusion , discussed by @xcite . for aperture photometry in an aperture of area @xmath19 large compared to the point spread function , their equation  5 becomes @xmath20 where the source density is represented by a power law @xmath21  sources deg@xmath22 mag@xmath17 .",
    "based on the source counts given in ",
    "[ sec : numcts ] , source confusion noise is comparable to photon noise at 3.6 and 4.5  and smaller than photon noise at 5.8 and 8.0  .",
    "the present mosaics have an additional noise source because of the method of data taking .",
    "observations in each location in the strip were taken at about the same time .",
    "therefore any temporal drift in the irac zero point translates nearly directly into a zero point shift with spatial position on the scale of the irac field of view ( 5 ) .",
    "errors in the flat field ( gain matrix ) will have a similar scale size but will only affect bright sources .    in view of the difficulty of knowing all the noise sources , we have adopted an empirical approach to determining the noise .",
    "aperture photometry of a set of 300 locations , distributed over the field and free of visible sources , gave a measure of variance for a range of aperture sizes at each wavelength .",
    "the variance for aperture sizes up to 12 pixels radius fits a function of the form suggested by @xcite : @xmath23 [ eq : noise ] where @xmath24 is the pixel - to - pixel rms noise and @xmath25 is the aperture radius .",
    "the data and fits are shown in figure  [ fig : sigma_npix ] ; table  [ tab : noise ] gives the coefficients @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the first term corresponds to the combined effects of source confusion and poisson noise , and the second term corresponds to the zero point uncertainty at any location .",
    "it is dominant for extended sources and amounts to 0.02  mjy  sr@xmath17at the two shorter wavelengths and 0.05  mjy  sr@xmath17 at the two longer wavelengths .",
    "this noise could potentially be decreased by different reduction techniques that force the mosaic zero point to be constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a radius of 3  pixels (=  18 ) , about the smallest aperture feasible , the first term implies noise of 0.04 , 0.05 , 0.5 , and 0.4  @xmath1jy in the four irac bands , respectively .",
    "for the two longer channels , this is roughly consistent with source confusion noise and represents the approximate limit to which an optimum technique could extract point sources . for the shorter two wavelengths ,",
    "the empirical `` linear '' noise is much smaller than the estimated confusion noise .",
    "the reason is unclear , but the most likely explanation is that the zero point uncertainty is so large as to make it impossible to measure the empirical confusion noise .",
    "the total empirical noise @xmath29 in a small beam is consistent with expected source confusion noise .",
    "to construct catalogs from the irac egs mosaics , we used the sextractor package ( v 2.5.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as is becoming standard in the field .",
    "we experimented with the input parameters to achieve an acceptable balance between completeness and reliability ( as judged by eye , but see also  [ sec : complete ] ) .",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m  mosaics are quite similar to each other in degree of crowding and background level , as are the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m  mosaics , but the short and long wavelength pairs are quite different from each other , so we derived 2 sets of input parameters for the two wavelengths regimes .",
    "the key values are given in table  [ tab : settings ] .",
    "most parameter settings were close to the defaults .",
    "the largest differences were the choice not to filter the images prior to detection , and setting the de - blending minimum contrast parameter to zero for the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m  images : these helped to improve the de - blending of crowded sources , particularly at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "the coverage images generated during mosaicing were used in two different ways as sextractor input . in a fairly standard procedure , the coverage maps were used as ` weight maps ' for detection , such that a faint object appearing on a deeper area of the image receives greater weight than one near the crust .",
    "we also generated a ` flag ' image by combining the individual band mosaics coverage maps with a minimum function and setting areas near bright stars affected by muxbleed or pulldown to have flag values of 1 . by including the flag values in the sextractor output , sources in regions of low coverage or near",
    "image artifacts could be easily eliminated from the final catalog .",
    "mosaic regions with coverage @xmath30 images ( 40 images at 8.0  @xmath1 m ) in all bands , a total area of about 1362  arcmin@xmath0 ( 0.38  deg@xmath0 ) , were used to generate the catalog .",
    "the area within the egs lost to artifact masking is about 15  arcmin@xmath0 , half of this in a 7.8  arcmin@xmath0 region around and between the two brightest stars , centered on j2000 coordinates @xmath31 .",
    "sextractor was used to measure source magnitudes in a number of different ways .",
    "the first method is standard circular aperture photometry , in apertures of radius 2.5 , 3.5 and 5.0 pixels ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34).% , with no dependence on the aperture position relative to the pixel center . ]",
    "these magnitude were corrected to total magnitudes using point - source corrections derived from the mosaic psf images and given in table  [ tab : apcor ] .",
    "also recorded were sextractor s auto and isocor magnitudes , which measure the total flux within the kron radius and the isophotal area above the background ( with a correction for flux in the psf wings ) , respectively .",
    "the isophotes used for photometry were determined separately for each channel ; they correspond to the level of the detection thresholds above the background ( given in table  [ tab : settings ] ) .",
    "no additional aperture corrections beyond those performed by sextractor were applied to the auto and isocor magnitudes .",
    "we did not attempt to measure magnitudes by psf - fitting .",
    "analysis of very deep observations in the ` irac dark field ' ( j. surace , priv . communication ) showed that most faint irac sources are slightly resolved ; for these objects , aperture photometry is more accurate .    to compute photometric uncertainties",
    ", sextractor assumes that the background sky noise is poisson and uncorrelated between adjacent pixels .",
    "this is not the case for our re - sampled , mosaiced data , so we followed @xcite in deriving a correction to the uncertainties , based on our noise measurements in  [ sec : obs ] . to correct the sextractor flux uncertainties we apply :",
    "@xmath35 [ eq : photcorr ] where @xmath36 is the object flux as measured in  mjy  sr@xmath17units , @xmath37 is the effective gain ( electrons per image unit , see table  [ tab : settings ] ) , and @xmath38 is computed from eq .",
    "[ eq : noise ] with the coefficients for each band given in table  [ tab : noise ] .",
    "the radius @xmath25 is the measurement aperture for aperture magnitudes , the kron radius in pixels for auto magnitudes , and @xmath39 for isophotal magnitudes .",
    "the magnitude of the correction factor varies with aperture size and , for objects in the number count peak , is typically about a factor of 2 for isocor and aperture magnitudes and 4 for auto magnitudes , which use larger apertures .",
    "aperture magnitudes are of course most appropriate for point sources , and some sources in the irac egs mosaics are clearly resolved .",
    "most of the obvious extended sources in the egs data are bright nearby galaxies which can be identified with the sextractor class_star output parameter .",
    "the distribution of class_star as a function of magnitude , combined with visual inspection of the images , shows that accurate separation between resolved and unresolved objects is possible for the 5785 sources brighter than @xmath40_{\\rm ab , auto}=20.25 $ ] .",
    "brighter than this limit , 3224 sources ( 56% ) have class_star @xmath41 and are therefore likely to be extended .",
    "comparison of the corrected aperture magnitudes to auto and isocor values for these sources suggests that , as expected , the two smaller aperture magnitudes underestimate the total flux , by 1020% on average .",
    "the 5-pixel - radius aperture magnitudes are within about 5% of the auto and isocor measurements , as are all of the corrected aperture magnitudes for point sources in the same magnitude range .",
    "most of the extended sources are relatively small , @xmath42  arcsec",
    ". however , 13 objects are large enough ( @xmath43  arcsec as measured on the 3.6  @xmath1 m  image ) to require the use of the ` extended source calibration'.see http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irac/calib/extcal/index.html table  [ tab : extdcorr ] gives the correction factors for each object , derived using the measured @xmath44 or @xmath45 in each band .",
    "these corrections _ have _ been applied to the final catalog .",
    "understanding the completeness and bias of a large survey is important for deriving its overall statistical properties , and the standard ` artificial object ' method was used to do this for the irac egs catalogs .",
    "both point and extended sources were generated using the artdata package in iraf with the mosaic point spread functions .",
    "there are a large number of possible parameters for artificial ` galaxies ' made with artdata ; we chose to use half ` exponential disk ' and half ` de vaucouleurs ' profiles , with axial ratios @xmath46 and effective radii @xmath47  pixel .",
    "although this is a rather small size , after being convolved with the psf , the resulting sources had similar sizes to the real objects in the images .",
    "the artificial sources were inserted into the mosaic images , then identified and photometered using sextractor in the same manner as real sources .",
    "a total of 50000 artificial sources were inserted with power - law ( @xmath48 ) distributions of magnitudes in ranges @xmath49_{ab}<26 $ ] , @xmath50_{ab}<25 $ ] , and @xmath51_{ab}<23.5 $ ] .",
    "the artificial sources were inserted 1500 at a time in the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m  mosaics , and 500 at a time in the more - crowded 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m  mosaics .",
    "an object was considered to be recovered if its position was within a radius of 1.5 pixels and its magnitude within 0.5  mag of an input artificial source .",
    "the second requirement reduces the chance that detection of a bright source will incorrectly be considered to be recovery of a nearby faint artificial source .",
    "completeness estimates were derived by sorting the artificial sources into bins by input magnitude and dividing the number of recovered sources by the number input .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : complete ] and given in tabular form in table  [ tab : comp ] .",
    "the completeness curves for the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m  bands have a somewhat shallower fall - off than those for the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m  bands .",
    "this is likely due to the effects of crowding : some sources which are well above the noise limit are not recovered because they fall too close to another source .",
    "as expected , the completeness for extended sources is somewhat lower than that for point sources .",
    "the 50% point - source completeness limits in the 4 irac bands are @xmath52 , or 1.1 , 1.2 , 6.3 , and 6.9 @xmath1jy .",
    "the 50%-completeness limits for extended sources are 0.3  mag brighter , corresponding to 1.5 , 1.6 , 8.3 , and 9.1 @xmath1jy .",
    "the artificial source tests also permit tests of sextractor s photometry .",
    "figures  [ fig : mag_off_star ] and [ fig : mag_off_glx ] show the results of sorting artificial objects into bins by input magnitude and computing the median offsets between input and recovered magnitudes .",
    "the aperture corrections described in  [ sec : obs ] were applied to the recovered aperture magnitudes . in general , the recovered magnitudes are fainter than the input magnitudes , but most offsets are consistent with zero within the scatter . as expected , the small - aperture magnitudes underestimate the total fluxes of extended sources , but large aperture magnitudes ( and to a lesser extent the isophotal and kron magnitudes ) recover the input flux , consistent with the results in  [ sec : sourceid ] . for point sources ,",
    "the standard deviations of the magnitude offsets per bin range from about 0.01  mag for the brightest artificial sources measured with the smallest aperture to @xmath53  mag for the faintest artificial sources measured with mag_auto .",
    "these values are roughly comparable to the median photometric uncertainties measured for the catalog objects in the same bins ( shown in [ fig : mag_off_star ] as solid lines ) . for extended sources the bin standard deviations range from 0.080.6 .",
    "for both point and extended sources , the scatter between input and recovered magnitudes increases going from aperture magnitudes through mag_isocor and finally to mag_auto . while these latter two magnitudes should provide better estimates of total flux for well - resolved sources , there are relatively few such objects in the egs images , and we recommend the use of aperture magnitudes for most analyses of the catalog . in the analysis which follows in  [ sec : analysis ]",
    "we use magnitudes measured in the 3.5-pixel ( 21 ) radius aperture ; this is near the ` ideal ' aperture chosen by @xcite and a reasonable compromise between the reduced contamination afforded by a smaller aperture and the greater flux fraction of a larger one .    to estimate the reliability of the catalog",
    ", we used the standard method of searching for sources on a negative image .",
    "this relies on the assumption that the noise is symmetric with respect to the background . using the same sextractor parameters described in ",
    "[ sec : sourceid ] , 640 sources were detected on the 3.6  @xmath1 m  image in the ( coverage @xmath30 ) region used to generate the catalog .",
    "the probability of spurious sources being detected at the same position in more than one band is proportional to the source density multiplied by the image and matching disk areas , and is @xmath54 for the source density found in the 3.6  @xmath1 m  negative image .",
    "negative versions of the 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m  mosaics were created and analyzed in the same method as for the final catalog ( by association with a source in the negative 3.6  @xmath1 m  image ; see  [ sec : bandmatch ] ) .",
    "no matched sources were found in the longer - wavelength negative mosaics at the same significance levels used for the real catalogs .",
    "therefore the only possible spurious sources are those detected only at 3.6  @xmath1 m .",
    "there are about 9400 such sources , with an estimated spurious fraction of @xmath55% .",
    "this gives an overall spurious fraction for the full 3.6  @xmath1 m  selected catalog of 1.1% , or a reliability of 99% .",
    "the precision and accuracy of positional measurements is an important quality in a large astronomical catalog .",
    "the quality of the astrometry in the irac mosaics is determined by both the world coordinate systems for the individual bcd images and the accuracy with which they are combined . to assess the astrometric quality of the irac catalog",
    ", we matched 3.6  @xmath1 m  sources within a 20 radius to optical sources from the deep2 photometric catalog @xcite , which is tied to the sdss coordinate frame .",
    "figures  [ fig : del_ra_dec ] and [ fig : astrom_trend ] show the results .",
    "the accuracy of the irac astrometry is very high overall : the median offset is @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) in ra ( declination ) .",
    "the precision , as indicated by the standard deviations of the offsets ( both 037 ) , is consistent with expectations from the size of the irac psf and pixels .",
    "there are larger offsets in both ra and dec at the northern and southern ends of the egs : these correspond to regions where the irac data were taken at only one epoch ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "evidently averaging two array position angles along the center of the egs improved small errors in astrometry . to maintain consistency between the catalog and released mosaic images ,",
    "we have not adjusted the positions of sources in the regions near the ends of the strip to make the median offsets equal to zero ( they are still consistent with zero within our quoted precision ) .",
    "catalog users wishing to adjust the astrometry for these sources should add @xmath58 to the coordinates of objects with @xmath59 and @xmath60 to the coordinates of objects with @xmath61 .",
    "the combination of measurements in the 4 irac bands was done using sextractor s ` association ' mechanism : the 3.6  @xmath1 m  catalog was used as the master catalog , with sources in the other 3 bands associated by pixel position .",
    "we chose this method rather than ` dual - image ' mode ( in which source and aperture positions are derived from a master image and used identically on other images ) because there were small ( @xmath11 pixel , or 12 ) but noticeable shifts between the mosaics in different bands , particularly at the ends of the egs .",
    "the offset appears to be between the two irac fields - of - view ( 3.6/5.8 and 4.5/8.0 ) , suggesting some relation to the mapping strategy used , although its exact cause is unclear .",
    "the offsets would have been problematic for dual - image mode , but the shifts were small enough that objects were matched between catalogs without difficulty . requiring a 3.6  @xmath1 m  detection does not unduly bias the catalog : less than a few hundred objects are detected at 4.5 , 5.8 or 8.0  @xmath1mwithout a corresponding 3.6  @xmath1 m  detection .",
    "all of these objects are faint ; many `` 8.0  @xmath1m - only objects '' are in fact detections of the galactic cirrus emission at the southeast end of the egs while others are the result of differences in de - blending between different bands .",
    "the irac egs catalog is presented in table  [ tab : cat ] .",
    "this is a 3.6  @xmath1m - selected catalog , so all objects are detected in this band .",
    "objects undetected in the other bands have all parameters listed as zero .",

    "] is about 28 at 3.6  @xmath1 m , 35 at 4.5  @xmath1 m , and @xmath68 at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "another measure of confusion is provided by matching irac sources with those from a catalog at higher resolution .",
    "such a catalog is available from the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) observations of the central 705 @xmath69 101 of the egs : there are about @xmath70 acs sources ( to @xmath71 ) in this area and about @xmath72 irac 3.6  @xmath1 m  sources . with a match radius of 20 , about 93% of 3.6",
    "@xmath1 m  sources were matched to an acs source .",
    "the irac sources without acs counterparts comprise 2 groups : stars which show diffraction spikes on the acs image but are not included in the acs catalog ( @xmath73% ) , and sources which are undetected on the optical image . about half of the acs - undetected sources are relatively bright ( @xmath40_{\\rm ab}\\lesssim 21 $ ] ) ; these interesting sources will be followed up in a future contribution .",
    "about 30% of the matched irac sources had two or more acs sources within 20 and roughly 7% had three or more acs sources within this radius .",
    "although sextractor attempts to correct for flux from neighboring objects when doing photometry , up to one - third of irac sources may have their photometry affected at some level by confusion .",
    "a fundamental property of any astronomical catalog is the distribution of sources as a function of flux . to compare our catalog with other recent work",
    ", we derived number counts of galaxies using the sextractor aperture magnitudes in the 21-radius aperture .",
    "the counts have been corrected for incompleteness using the results of  [ sec : complete ] .",
    "the star count model for the egs given in @xcite was subtracted from the raw number counts ; no other attempt was made to separate stars and galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : numcts ] shows the number counts derived from the egs data and compares them to other recent measurements in the irac bands @xcite and the models of @xcite .",
    "there is excellent agreement with the results of @xcite , as expected since the data and analysis methods used are very similar .",
    "our number counts are reasonably consistent with previous results , except at the faintest magnitudes where our incompleteness may be underestimated .",
    "the @xcite models produce the correct general trends but are offset from the data by up to a factor of 2 , a feature also apparent in their figure  1 .",
    "@xcite did not consider this offset serious since their models had not been tuned to match the _",
    "data .",
    "galaxy colors in the irac bands are affected by a number of components : the rayleigh - jeans tail of emission from starlight , pah emission , the redshifted 1.6  @xmath1 m  stellar opacity minimum , and ( often red power - law ) emission from an agn .",
    "determining the dominant source of emission for irac sources is complicated by the lack of redshift information for many sources ; irac s sensitivity allows it to detect galaxies in the ` redshift desert ' where optical spectroscopic redshifts are not easy to obtain . but",
    "a general picture of the irac source can be derived by examination of color distributions and comparison with models and other surveys . in the following analysis",
    ", all colors are measured using aperture magnitudes ( including aperture corrections ) in the aperture with radius 3.5 pixels ( 21 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : colordist ] shows the distribution of irac source colors relative to the 3.6  @xmath1 m  band .",
    "as expected , few sources are bluer than unreddened stars , although pah emission in the 3.6  @xmath1 m  band and co absorption in the 4.5  @xmath1 m  band can cause some bluer colors .",
    "the @xmath40-[4.5]$ ] color distribution is relatively narrow and is similar for sources with and without 8.0  @xmath1 m  detections .",
    "the colors involving the two longer wavelength bands show much more dispersion , presumably because they depends on the variable strengths of the pah features moving through the bands with redshift ( see also figure 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows a color - magnitude diagram for sources with and without 8.0  @xmath1 m  detections ; the latter are simply fainter .",
    "the bright , blue objects in the left - hand panel are stars ; the red measured colors for the brightest objects are due to saturation in the 3.6  @xmath1 m  photometry .    the 4 irac bands can be combined in a number of ways to make two - color diagrams .",
    "different authors plot these in different ways : as flux ratios , colors in the vega system , and colors in the ab system .",
    "we have plotted all such diagrams in the ab system , which has the advantage that different combinations of colors can be easily compared , but the disadvantage of complicating comparisons to previous work .",
    "figure  [ fig:4color ] show two - color diagrams using the 3 possible combinations of all 4 irac bands .",
    "the three diagrams have some common features : a relatively tight distribution of sources with the bluest colors , and two branches at redder colors .",
    "the blue sources are particularly well - separated in figure  [ fig:4color]c and are presumably dominated by stellar emission . in the models of @xcite , using the color space of figure  [ fig:4color]b , the vertical branch is dominated by low - redshift galaxies with pah emission , and the redder diagonal branch ( which dominates the egs distribution ) is expected to be some mixture of agn and high - redshift galaxies . comparing figure  [",
    "fig:4color]a to figure  1 of @xcite , the egs catalog appears to contains fewer low - redshift , pah - dominated galaxies ( upper left ) but more sources in the ` agn wedge ' ( centre right ) , and the location expected for high - redshift normal galaxies ( lower right ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fainter flux limit of the egs observations : these should contain more high - redshift galaxies than the irac shallow survey sources with optical spectroscopy plotted by @xcite , and at @xmath74 , star - forming galaxies begin to have similar observed colors to agn @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn from comparison of figure  [ fig:4color ] with figure  1a of @xcite : as expected , the egs has a lower proportion of low - redshift galaxies compared to the shallower but wider swire survey .",
    "there are many more combinations of three irac bands than can be conveniently plotted ; figure  [ fig:3color ] shows a few . the color space shown in figure  [ fig:3color]a does not appear to be useful for separating different galaxy types ; the sources all lie roughly along a single axis .",
    "figure  [ fig:3color]b is quite similar to figure  [ fig:4color]a , which might suggest that the 5.8  @xmath1 m  band does not provide much additional information over the combination of the other 3 bands .",
    "however , figure  [ fig:3color]c shows that the use of the three shortest bands works well to identify red sources .",
    "this color space was used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 4 ) to suggest a color criterion for type 1 agn .",
    "however , @xcite found that only about 30% of x  ray selected agn in the egs fell into their selection region .",
    "* figure 1c ) suggest that objects red in both @xmath40-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath75-[5.8]$ ] are a mixture of agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the egs contains a greater proportion of these objects than the swire survey , as shown above .",
    "figure  [ fig:3color]d is the same color space plotted in figure  1b of @xcite ; as seen there , the omission of the 3.6  @xmath1 m  band appears to decrease the separation between the various galaxy types .",
    "observations of a 0.38  deg@xmath0 area in the extended groth strip using the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the spitzer space telescope detected tens of thousands of mid - infrared sources .",
    "the 3.6  @xmath1m - selected catalog presented here includes 57434 sources , of which most are detected at 4.5  @xmath1 m  and roughly one - quarter are detected at 5.8  @xmath1 m  and 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "number counts of sources are consistent with previous observations and marginally consistent with recent models .",
    "as expected , color distributions differ from those of shallower surveys by including a greater fraction of potential high - redshift sources .",
    "future projects possible with this catalog include determination of photometric redshifts , galaxy stellar mass and luminosity functions , and mid - infrared characterization of populations such as luminous infrared galaxies and agn .",
