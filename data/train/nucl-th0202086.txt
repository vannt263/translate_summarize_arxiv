    "one of the major goals in relativistic heavy ion collisions is to study the properties of hot and dense matter and possibly to create and identify a new form of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that enhanced strangeness production could serve as an important signal for the deconfined matter .",
    "the dominant production of @xmath1 pairs via gluon - gluon interaction may lead to strangeness ( chemical and flavor ) equilibration times comparable to the lifetime of the plasma and much shorter than that of a thermally equilibrated hadronic fireball .",
    "the subsequent hadronization is then expected to result in an enhanced production of strange and multistrange particles and antiparticles . in particular",
    ", it has been argued that with the formation of quark - gluon plasma not only the production of phi mesons , which consist of @xmath1 , is enhanced but they also retain the information on the conditions of the hot plasma as it is believed that phi mesons interact weakly in the hadronic matter and therefore freeze out quite early from the system @xcite .    using a proton or sulfur projectile at 200 gev / nucleon and a tungsten or uranium target , phi meson production has been previously studied at cern / sps by the na38 collaboration @xcite and the helios-3 collaboration @xcite via the dimuon invariant mass spectra .",
    "the double ratio @xmath2 has been measured and was found to have a value of @xmath3 .",
    "various theoretical attempts have been made to understand this enhancement . in particular , an enhancement of phi",
    "meson yield may be a signature of the formation of a quark gluon plasma in the collisions @xcite .",
    "however , this enhancement can also be explained either using hadronic models if one takes into account the reduced phi meson mass in nuclear medium @xcite or via the fragmentation of color ropes that are formed from the initial strings @xcite .",
    "recently , phi meson production has also been measured in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 gev at the cern / sps .",
    "the na49 collaboration @xcite has identified the phi meson via the decay channel @xmath5 , while the na50 collaboration @xcite measured it using @xmath6 decay .",
    "it was found that the extracted number of phi meson from dimuon channel exceeds by a factor between two and four from that extracted from the @xmath7 channel . this difference has been attributed to the fact that not all phi mesons can be reconstructed from @xmath7 resulting from their decays due to rescattering of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the hadronic matter .",
    "the suppression factor can be 40 - 60% based on the rqmd model @xcite .",
    "this effect has been further studied in a schematic model by including the effect of changing kaon masses in the hadronic medium @xcite .    in the present paper , using a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model we make a detailed and consistent study of the production of phi mesons reconstructed from the @xmath7 and @xmath10 decay channels .",

    "the ampt model @xcite is a hybrid model that uses as input the minijet partons from the hard processes and the strings from the soft processes in the hijing model @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of partons are then modeled by the zpc @xcite parton cascade model , while the transition from the partonic matter to the hadronic matter is based on the lund string fragmentation model @xcite .",
    "the final - state hadronic scatterings are modeled by the art model @xcite .",
    "the ampt model has been quite successful in describing the measured transverse momenta of pions and kaons , and the rapidity distributions of charge particles @xcite as well as the particle to antiparticle ratios @xcite in heavy ion collisions at both sps and rhic . including melting of initial strings to partons ,",

    "since the phi meson mass is only 32 mev above the kaon - antikaon threshold , it is strongly coupled to the kaon and antikaon dynamics , i.e. , to the strangeness content of the surrounding medium .",
    "a small change in the masses of either the phi meson or kaon thus would appreciably affect the decay width of phi meson .",

    "at density @xmath58 , the phi meson in - medium width is about 45 mev .",
    "since phi meson is unstable , it can only be detected from its decay product of either the kaon - antikaon pair or the lepton pair .",
    "the kaon - antikaon pair decaying from a phi meson is , however , likely to undergo appreciable rescattering in the medium , and this would lead to a reconstructed invariant mass situated outside the original phi meson peak .",
    "in fact , the momentum transfer to a kaon suffering one collision with a pion at @xmath59 mev can be estimated to be about 45 mev which is much larger than the total phi meson width of @xmath60 mev .",
    "hence phi mesons decaying in the dense medium is difficult to be identified via reconstructed kaon - antikaon pairs .",
    "in contrast , dileptons have negligible final - state interactions with the surrounding hadronic medium and therefore escape essentially unscathed during the entire evolution of the system .",
    "dileptons are thus considered to carry useful information about hadron properties in hot and dense hadronic matter @xcite , which are expected to be different from those in free space .      to detect a phi meson from its dimuon decay ,",

    "the reconstructed phi meson number is obtained by dividing the above expression by the dimuon branching ratio in free - space of @xmath67 . since most previous studies @xcite have neglected the phi meson annihilation and production channels via baryons and especially by pseudoscalar and vector mesons ,",
    "the phi meson lifetime in these studies is thus comparable to the lifetime of the system .",
    "consequently , phi mesons from dimuon channel get significant contributions only after freeze - out .",

    "if the production of phi meson dominates over its decay especially at the early dense stage of the collision , the dimuons originating from the phi meson decay will be enhanced . on the other hand",
    ", the kaon - antikaon pairs from phi meson decays will be essentially undetected in the phi meson reconstruction as they are expected to be rescattered and experience strong medium modifications of their masses .",
    "we have used the extended ampt model described in the above to study phi meson production in heavy ion collisions at both sps and rhic energies .",

    "the solid curves are the results from calculations where both kaon and phi meson medium effects are neglected .",
    "the minijet partons and predominantly string decays in the hijing model at the sps energy produces about 2.6 initial number of phi mesons per event . since these phi mesons are produced at different times as a result of finite formation time , they appear successively in the art hadronic transport .",
    "subsequent multiple rescattering in the hadronic medium leads to a peak value of @xmath73 at @xmath74 fm / c , which finally decays to @xmath75 at an average freeze - out time of @xmath76 fm / c .",
    "because of small decay width of @xmath0 into @xmath19 pair , most of the phi mesons decay outside the fireball ( see upper right panel of fig . [ time ] ) . in spite of this small width",
    ", the production of phi meson from the inverse reaction dominates over the decay due to considerable abundance of kaons from the hijing model at the early stage of the reaction . at times @xmath77 fm / c the process @xmath72 is seen to approach chemical equilibrium .",

    "1 ) , the larger abundance of pions relative to kaons ( @xmath81 from the hijing ) leads to similar contribution to phi meson production in both these reactions .",
    "moreover , the small abundance of phi meson results in identical production and annihilation rates for @xmath82 collision ( lower left panel ) , i.e. chemical equilibrium in this reaction is rapidly achieved .",
    "in contrast , phi meson production overwhelms its destruction ( lower right panel ) due to larger abundances of the mesons @xmath83 relative to @xmath28 and especially @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , the process @xmath84 with its largest cross section and smaller threshold contributes @xmath85 to the total @xmath86 formation . this enhanced production at about 3 fm / c is reflected in the rapid increase of the phi meson abundance ( upper left panel ) . the production and annihilation rates for phi mesons in processes involving @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are not shown in the figure , exhibit similar qualitative features as for those with @xmath28 and @xmath32 , but are about a factor of 1.5 smaller reflecting the @xmath89 ratio of 0.70 at the sps energy .",
    "the phi meson collisional rate as observed here is considerably larger than that predicted in all previous calculations @xcite .",
    "as the system expands the collisional rate drops and these reactions reach chemical equilibration at @xmath90 fm / c .",
    "finally , at a later time phi meson decay becomes more effective than its absorption .",

    "the chemical equilibration of phi mesons via production and annihilation in the hadronic matter can be better seen by switching off the initial phi production from string decays in the hijing model . as shown by the dash - dotted curve in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ time ] , this leads to a suppressed peak in the time evolution of phi meson abundance but does not change much the phi meson number at later times , when compared to that in the case of including the initial phi mesons from string decays .",

    "similar to the results for heavy ion collisions at sps , the phi meson yield from the dimuon channel is about 1.5 times larger than that from the @xmath7 channel in the absence of additional phi meson production due to the formation of the initial partonic stage .",
    "this number is expected to increase significantly if we include such enhanced production of initial phi mesons .",
    "indeed at rhic , large energy densities are expected to be reached , and a partonic matter with a longer lifetime and occupying a larger volume could be formed .",
    "compared to sps energy , larger @xmath1 production in the partonic stage and its subsequent hadronization would therefore result in an enhanced phi meson abundance , especially at the early stages .",
    "these phi mesons should contribute dominantly in the dimuon channel while most of them will escape detection in the kaonic channel .",
    "it is thus of great interest to have experimental data on phi mesons from the dimuon measurement at the rhic energy .",
