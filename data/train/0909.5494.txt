    "the inner crust in neutron stars spans the region from the neutron drip - out point to the inner edge separating the solid crust from the homogeneous liquid core and plays an important role in understanding many astrophysical observations  @xcite . while the neutron drip - out density @xmath6 is relatively well determined to be about @xmath7 g/@xmath8 @xcite , the transition density @xmath9 at the inner edge is still largely uncertain mainly because of our very limited knowledge on the eos of neutron - rich nucleonic matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made in constraining the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter using terrestrial laboratory experiments ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the most recent review ) .",
    "in particular , the analysis of isospin - diffusion data @xcite in heavy - ion collisions has constrained tightly the @xmath10 in exactly the same sub - saturation density region around the expected inner edge of neutron star crust . in the present talk ,",
    "we report our recent work on locating the inner edge of the neutron star crust using terrestrial nuclear laboratory data within both thermodynamical and dynamical methods  @xcite .     versus @xmath11 and @xmath12 by using the dynamical method with and without the pa using the mdi interaction .",

    "@xcite ]     versus @xmath11 and @xmath12 by using the dynamical method with and without the pa using the mdi interaction .",
    "the star with error bar in the left panel represents @xmath13  mev .",
    "taken from ref .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ rhotl ] is the @xmath9 as a function of the slope parameter of the symmetry energy @xmath14 with the mdi interaction  @xcite . for comparisons ,",
    "we have included results using both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods with the full eos and its parabolic approximation ( pa ) , i.e. , @xmath15 using the same mdi interaction .",
    "the thermodynamical method is the long wave length limit of the dynamical one when the coloumb and surface interactions are neglected @xcite . with the full mdi eos , it is clearly seen that the @xmath9 decreases almost linearly with increasing @xmath11 within both methods .",
    "it is interesting to see that the two methods give very similar results ( the difference is actually less than @xmath3 @xmath1 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the pa drastically changes the results , especially for stiffer symmetry energies ( larger @xmath11 values ) . also included in fig .",
    "[ rhotl ] are the predictions by kubis using the pa of the mdi eos in the thermodynamical approach  @xcite . the large error introduced by the pa is understandable since the @xmath16-stable @xmath17 matter is usually highly neutron - rich , thus the contribution from the higher order terms in @xmath18 is appreciable .",
    "this is especially true for the stiffer symmetry energy which generally leads to a more neutron - rich @xmath19 matter at subsaturation densities .",
    "in addition , simply because of the energy curvatures involved in the stability conditions , the contributions from higher order terms in the eos are multiplied by a larger factor than the quadratic term .",
    "our results indicate that one may introduce a huge error by assuming _ a priori _ that the eos is parabolic with respect to the isospin asymmetry for a given interaction in calculating the @xmath9 .",
    "we thus apply the experimentally constrained @xmath11 to the @xmath20 correlation obtained using the full eos in constraining the @xmath21 in the dynamical method as it is more complete and realistic . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rhotl ] , the constrained @xmath22 mev obtained from the transport model analysis of the isospin diffusion data  @xcite then limits the transition density to @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath2 @xmath1 .",
    "the pressure at the inner edge , @xmath24 , is also an important quantity which might be measurable indirectly from observations of pulsar glitches @xcite . shown in fig .",
    "[ ptlrhot ] is the @xmath24 versus @xmath11 and @xmath9 .",
    "again , it is seen that the pa leads to huge errors for larger ( smaller ) @xmath11 ( @xmath9 ) values . for the full mdi eos ,",
    "the @xmath24 decreases ( increases ) with the increasing @xmath11 ( @xmath9 ) while it displays a complex relation with @xmath11 or @xmath9 for the pa .",
    "the complex behaviors are due to the fact that the @xmath9 does not vary monotonically with @xmath11 for the pa as shown in fig .",
    "[ rhotl ] . from the constrained @xmath11 values",
    ", the @xmath24 is limited between @xmath3 mev/@xmath4 and @xmath25 mev/@xmath4 .",
    "the constrained values of @xmath9 and @xmath24 have important implications on many properties of neutron stars  @xcite . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crustal fraction of the total moment of inertia of a neutron star , i.e. , @xmath26 depends sensitively on the @xmath27 and @xmath28 at subsaturation densities , but there is no explicit dependence upon the higher - density eos .",
    "so far , the only known limit of @xmath29 was extracted from studying the glitches of the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "this together with the upper bounds on the @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath30 @xmath1 and @xmath31 mev/@xmath4 ) sets approximately a minimum radius of @xmath32 km for the vela pulsar . the radius of the vela pulsar is predicted to exceed @xmath33 km should it have a mass of @xmath34 .",
    "a more restrictive constraint will be obtained from the lower bounds of @xmath35 @xmath1 ( @xmath36 mev/@xmath4 ) and it can be approximately parameterized by @xmath37 km .",
    "it is thus seen that the errors in both the transition density and pressure are still large .",
    "thus , the uncertainties for the mass - radius relation of the vela pulsar are still large . a conservative constraint of @xmath38 km using the upper bounds on the @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "was then obtained @xcite .",
    "we notice that a constraint of @xmath39 km for this pulsar was previously derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by using @xmath40 @xmath1 and @xmath41 mev/@xmath4 .",
    "however , the constraint obtained using data from both the terrestrial laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations is significantly more stringent ."
