    "for investigations of the interstellar gases in either our galaxy or distant systems in the universe , nickel belongs to a class of elements that is usually strongly depleted onto dust grains ( savage & sembach 1996 ; jenkins 2004 ) , but also represents the important iron - peak group that is synthesized mostly by type  ia supernovae at later stages in a galaxy s chemical evolution ( wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ; mcwilliam 1997 ) . for neutral regions having @xmath14 , most of the ni atoms should be in the singly ionized form .",
    "numerous ni  ii lines with differing strengths in the wavelength interval @xmath15  are well suited for deriving column densities of singly - ionized ni using a curve of growth .",
    "other fe - group elements such as cr , mn , fe , co and zn also exhibit two or more moderately strong lines for their most abundant , singly - ionized forms , but most of the useful features are at @xmath16  in the rest frame , a wavelength range that might not be covered by some observations .",
    "( a few lines of cu  ii at shorter wavelengths are usually too weak to observe . )    in the recent compilation by morton ( 2003 ) of uv and visible transitions out of the ground electronic states of various atoms , experimentally determined @xmath7-values are listed for 14 different transitions of ni  ii , with numerical values that range from 0.001 to 0.08,-values for ni  ii were listed in morton s ( 1991 ) earlier survey of resonance lines , but these values were based on the approximate theoretical @xmath7-values of kurucz ( communicated privately to morton ) . in his publication of 2003 ,",
    "morton chose not to list these @xmath7-values because they had a much lower accuracy than the experimental values . ]",
    "based on the laser - induced fluorescence lifetime measurements of fedchak & lawler ( 1999 ) for a few of them , with extensions to the remaining ones using relative absorption strengths measured in the laboratory by fedchak , wiese & lawler ( 2000 ) and supplemented by hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) recordings of absorption lines measured by zsarg & federman ( 1998).-values and scaled them according the old values for other ni  ii lines given in morton ( 1991 ) . later , fedchak & lawler ( 1999 ) recommended that those @xmath7-values should be scaled downward by a factor 0.534 , on the basis of changes in the @xmath7-values indicated for comparison transitions at longer wavelengths .",
    "morton s ( 2003 ) compilation has adopted the @xmath7-values of zsarg & federman ( 1998 ) with this reduction factor . ]",
    "these measurements have made some important improvements in the @xmath7-values of different ni  ii transitions and have resolved some earlier apparent anomalies in the abundance ratios of ni to fe in various distant gas systems ( howk , savage , & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "finally , theoretical calculations of the transition probabilities for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 transition arrays of ni  ii have been carried out by fritzsche , dong & gaigalas ( 2000 ) .",
    "one transition that has not yet been investigated experimentally is the @xmath19 line of ni  ii at 1317.217@xmath0 .",
    "as we show later , this line has a strength about equal to those of the strongest lines of ni  ii at 1370.132@xmath0and 1741.553@xmath0  to the upper level configurations @xmath20 and @xmath3 . for extragalactic systems that have only enough ni  ii to allow a detection using either the 1370@xmath0  line or the one at 1741@xmath0 , the usefulness of these lines might be compromised in some circumstances by either restrictions in the wavelength coverage or possible interference from random lines from the ly@xmath21 forest when @xmath22 .",
    "thus , having a redundant feature with about the same strength at a different wavelength provides a useful alternative to help overcome these limitations .",
    "the strength of the transition at 1370@xmath0  has not been measured in the laboratory , but instead zsarg & federman ( 1998 ) have compared interstellar features for this line to those seen at longer wavelengths for which laboratory data now exist [ their original study made use of the less accurate @xmath7-values given in morton ( 1991 ) ] .",
    "this comparison , however , was performed for only 2 velocity components appearing in the spectrum of a single star ( @xmath23  oph ) , and the interpretations of these mildly saturated lines made use of curves of growth for velocity parameters @xmath24 derived from the lines of other species ( savage , cardelli , & sofia 1992 ) .",
    "thus , while the @xmath7-value of the 1370@xmath0line has been determined astrophysically , it is reasonable to expect an improvement in accuracy if more interstellar line data can be obtained .",
    "our objective of this study is to gather high - resolution spectra of hot stars from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archive and intercompare the strengths of the interstellar absorption features from ni  ii at the wavelengths 1317 , 1370 , and 1741@xmath0 .",
    "the line at 1741@xmath0  will be used as our fundamental comparison standard , since its @xmath7-value has been measured in the laboratory ( fedchak & lawler 1999 ) and thus is relatively trustworthy .",
    "an important feature of our comparisons is that the near similarity of line strengths for any given target star makes our interpretations relatively immune to poorly understood saturation effects , since such effects , if they exist , will have roughly equal strengths for all three lines and thus will not affect the ratios that we calculate .",
    "the spectra that we use contain either the line pair 1317 and 1370@xmath0 , or the pair 1317 and 1741@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we are not able to directly compare the 1370@xmath0line to the one at 1741@xmath0 , but instead we must link it to the line at 1317@xmath0 .",
    "a similar determination of the relative ni  ii @xmath7-values was carried out by ellison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using a spectrum of a damped ly@xmath21 system in front of a quasar .",
    "we expect that our comparison should be more accurate , since we are using many spectra and ones of high s / n .",
    "also , in many cases our spectral resolution is much higher , which makes it much less likely that we could be misled by the effects of narrow , saturated velocity components .",
    "for our study of the absorption pairs at 1317 and 1741@xmath0 , we used spectroscopic data for 21 stars gathered from our earlier study of c  i absorption features ( jenkins & tripp 2001 ) that employed the e140h and e230h echelle gratings of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst _ ( observing program nrs .",
    "8043 and 8484 ) .",
    "the design and performance of stis have been discussed by woodgate et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kimble et al .",
    "the spectra had resolving powers @xmath25 because they were recorded with a very narrow entrance slit on the spectrograph ( @xmath26 ) , and the detector was read out with twice the normal spatial sampling rate .",
    "we described in our previous article ( jenkins & tripp 2001 ) the special data reduction techniques that we used to preserve the high spectral resolution without showing a high - frequency signal caused by a sensitivity imbalance of adjacent hi - res pixels of the stis mama detector . for the 1741@xmath0  line",
    ", we could combine the recordings in two adjacent echelle orders to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . to show the quality of the spectra , we present in figure  [ vstack_plot ] some examples of the e140h and e230h data that we used .",
    "the observations by jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) did not cover the ni  ii line at 1370@xmath0 , so an entirely separate collection of observations was used to compare the 1317@xmath0  transition to the one at 1370@xmath0 .",
    "most of the data were taken from snap observations of many stars in the milky way ( program ids 8241 , 8662 , 9434 initiated by j.  lauroesch ) that are held in the mast archive at the space telescope science institute , with a few additional targets from the observations taken for program nrs .",
    "7137 , 7270 , 7301 , and 8487 .",
    "the spectra were recorded for 48 different stars using the e140h and e140 m gratings with wavelength resolving powers @xmath27 and 110,000 , respectively ( kim quijano et al . 2003 ) .",
    "a subset of these stars was used for a validation exercise with another ni  ii line at 1454@xmath0  discussed in  [ f(1454 ) ] .    for all of the spectra in both studies ,",
    "the ni  ii features were always visible .",
    "they had equivalent widths that ranged from 8 to 140@xmath0m .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath28 per pixel ) to obtain the @xmath28 per resolution element . ] ranged from 18 to 50 ( fig .  [ vstack_plot ] shows spectra with @xmath29 ) . for the star with the weakest lines ,",
    "the equivalent widths of the ni  ii lines were at least 3 times their respective @xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "we restricted our investigation to stars with large projected rotation velocities , @xmath31 , in order to avoid ambiguous continuum placement problems and blending with stellar lines .",
    "in a few cases , velocity components that were well separated from each other could be measured separately .",
    "we fitted continua to the spectra using least - squares fits to legendre polynomials in places that were free of spectral features , features of s  i. often these lines were not visible or barely visible ; the s  i lines that appear in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ vstack_plot ] are unusually strong . ]",
    "following the methods outlined by sembach & savage ( 1992 ) .",
    "errors in line strength caused by continuum uncertainties can be evaluated from the error matrix for the polynomial coefficients , but we have found from past experience that it is wise to multiply these uncertainties by 2 to allow for certain arbitrary assumptions , such as the choice of wavelengths over which the intensities are used to define the continuum .",
    "another source of error is the uncertainty of photon counts within the absorption line , as indicated by the stis intensity error vector .",
    "this error should be independent of the one related to the continuum uncertainty .",
    "hence , we could add the two in quadrature to evaluate the overall uncertainty in the measurement . for one of our line - pair comparisons ( 1317 vs. 1370@xmath0 ) we found that the magnitudes of the apparent random deviations away from a simple relationship between the overall line strengths was slightly larger than expected , indicating that additional small errors are probably present .",
    "( we will return to this issue later . ) a reasonable interpretation for these additional errors is that they arise either from variations in the detector sensitivity ( i.e. , `` fixed - pattern noise '' ) that were not fully corrected , or from inaccurate scattered light corrections .    for weak lines in the presence of noise ,",
    "it is important to impose rigid constraints on the wavelength limits for the measurement .",
    "otherwise , we may introduce errors in the comparison if the limits changed from one line to the next , and moreover , systematic biases in the measurements can arise if the lines own appearances are used as guides for the end points ( joseph 1989 ) .",
    "thus , we defined the velocity limits for interstellar material along each line of sight using the s  ii line at 1250.578@xmath0 .",
    "this line is usually much stronger than the ni  ii lines , so that it is easier to see the full extent of the absorptions above the noise , but not so strong that small , irrelevant wisps of high velocity material cause an unnecessary consideration of the more extreme velocities .",
    "another advantage in using a strong line to define the velocity limits is that we can be more certain that the continuum definition occurs at wavelengths that are fully outside the region where any absorption might occur .",
    "the principle invoked here for defining the velocity limits from the s  ii feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vstack_plot ] .    to simplify our comparison of line strengths , we compute the apparent optical depths @xmath32 $ ] over all relevant velocities @xmath33 within the absorption feature ( savage & sembach 1991 )",
    ". the ratios of these quantities at any velocity for two lines should indicate the relative values of @xmath34 , provided there are no narrow , unresolved structures that are saturated within the profiles ( savage & sembach 1991 ; jenkins 1996 ) .",
    "the largest value of @xmath35 that we ever found was 1.4 , which means that at no point in any of the spectra were the lines heavily saturated .",
    "figure  [ compare2_plot ] shows comparisons in different spectra of the apparent optical depths for the 1317 and 1741@xmath0  lines , integrated over velocity , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the 1317@xmath0  line has about the same strength as the one at 1741@xmath0 .",
    "from the fact that all measurements fall very near a single diagonal line with a unit slope in this diagram , it is evident that stars with strong ni  ii lines do not show a ratio of line strengths that is appreciably different from cases showing much weaker features .",
    "this increases our confidence that we are not being misled by unrecognized saturation effects .",
    "our best determination for @xmath37 , a quantity that we designate as the logarithm of the value of @xmath34 for the 1317@xmath0  transition divided by that for the 1741@xmath0  one , was derived from a weighted mean of the individual differences in the logarithms of the integrated apparent optical depths , @xmath38_i\\,w_i\\bigg/\\sum w_i\\ ] ] where each weight @xmath39 is given by the inverse square of the error of each comparison , @xmath40 ^ 2+\\sigma\\big[\\log \\tau_{\\rm a , int}(1741)\\big]^2\\big\\}^{-1}~,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 $ ] being the uncertainty of the respective @xmath42 value arising from the combination of continuum and photon counting errors . with the use of eqs .",
    "[ r ] and [ w ] we found that @xmath43 our determination @xmath44 for 20 degrees of freedom seems reasonable , indicating that our formally derived errors are probably correct . the formal uncertainty for @xmath37 given in eq .",
    "[ result2 ] was derived from the expression @xmath45 .    to determine the @xmath7-value of the 1317@xmath0  transition",
    ", we take the product of @xmath46 measured by fedchak et al . ( 2000 ) and listed by morton ( 2003 ) , @xmath47 , and the ratio of wavelengths ( 1741/1317 ) to obtain @xmath48 .",
    "our value for @xmath49 is much smaller than the probable uncertainty of 0.04  dex estimated by fedchak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the value of @xmath50 , which served as our comparison standard .",
    "this error thus dominates the relative uncertainty of the @xmath7-value of the 1317@xmath0  line .",
    "now that we have derived our value for @xmath51 , we can use our other set of observations that had both the 1317 and 1370@xmath0  features to derive @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ compare_plot ] shows our comparison of these two lines , shown in the same style as that of fig .",
    "[ compare2_plot ] .",
    "again we use eqs .",
    "[ r ] and [ w ] ( but this time replacing the 1741@xmath0  line with the 1370@xmath0  one ) to derive @xmath53dex with @xmath54dex .",
    "unlike what we had found for our study of the 1317/1741 line pairs , we obtained indications that our calculated line measurement errors slightly underestimated the true ones , since we found that @xmath55 for 51 degrees of freedom . to properly acknowledge that the scatter of the results exceeded our initial expectations , we created an additional , ad - hoc error term @xmath56 that we felt should be factored into our determinations of @xmath57 .",
    "the square of this term was added to the sums of the squares of the errors attributable to just the deviations caused by continuum and noise uncertainties , so that the value of @xmath58 was ultimately reduced to about 50 . with these slightly larger errors , the re - evaluation of eqs .",
    "[ r ] and [ w ] gave our final result , @xmath59    in a calculation similar to the one for the 1317@xmath0  line , we now evaluate the product of @xmath48 that we found earlier (  [ f(1317 ) ] ) , @xmath60 , and the wavelength ratio to obtain @xmath61 . by combining the errors in the determinations of the two values of @xmath37 that must be used ( the ones in eqs .",
    "[ result2 ] and [ result1 ] ) to link ultimately to the @xmath7-value of the 1741@xmath0line , we obtain a formal relative uncertainty of 0.009@xmath0dex , which once again is small compared to the 10% error in the comparison line .",
    "the strength of the ni  ii transition to the @xmath62 level at 1454.842@xmath0  has been determined by fedchak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , although only to an accuracy of 25% ( 0.12@xmath0dex ) . as a demonstration",
    ", we can repeat the analysis that we performed in  [ f(1370 ) ] for this line , so that we can gain some assurance that our comparison method is sound .",
    "in fact , this test is more demanding than the actual studies that we carried out , since the strength of the 1454@xmath0  is substantially less than those of the other three lines .",
    "figure  [ compare3_plot ] shows our comparison of the 1317@xmath0  and 1454@xmath0  lines , shown in the same style as in figs .",
    "[ compare2_plot ] and [ compare_plot ] . for these data ,",
    "once again we used eqs .",
    "[ r ] and [ w ] ( replacing the 1741@xmath0  line with the 1454@xmath0  line ) to obtain @xmath63 which yielded @xmath64 for 23 degrees of freedom . from the above value of @xmath37",
    ", we infer from a repeat of the calculations discussed previously that @xmath65 .",
    "this result is consitent with the value @xmath66 derived by fedchak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to within their stated error .",
    "in acknowledging the importance of deriving gas - phase abundances of ni in various astrophysical systems , we have recognized a need for deriving an @xmath7-value for the ni  ii transition at 1317@xmath0 , as well as the desirability of obtaining an improved accuracy for the @xmath7-value of the line at 1370@xmath0 .",
    "for the first of these two goals , we have compared the integrated apparent optical depths @xmath67 of interstellar ni  ii absorption features at 1317@xmath0  to those of their counterparts 1741@xmath0  seen in high - resolution spectra of 21 stars recorded by stis on _",
    "the @xmath7-value of the 1741@xmath0  line has been determined by laboratory measurements to a good accuracy ( 10% ) , it can serve as a comparison standard for the 1317@xmath0  line .",
    "we have deliberately avoided trying to compare the 1317@xmath0  transition to other , weaker ones , so that we can bypass the uncertainties that are created by possible unresolved , saturated substructures within the line profiles .",
    "nevertheless , the success of our demonstration given in  [ f(1454 ) ] shows that our method works satisfactorily even when there is a moderately large disparity of line strengths .",
    "we used the strong profiles of s  ii absorptions at 1250@xmath0  to define the velocity end points of the ni  ii profiles , which on some occasions were difficult to measure .",
    "our analysis indicated that @xmath68 , where the error is dominated by the uncertainty in the @xmath7-value of the comparison line .",
    "it is important to note that this value is only 0.39 times as large as the approximate theoretical value supplied by kurucz that was listed in morton s ( 1991 ) earlier compilation ( and does not appear in the most recent listing of 2003 ) .",
    "following our derivation of @xmath51 , we examined spectra of 48 stars ( different from the ones used for the 1317/1741 comparison ) that had both the 1317 and 1370@xmath0  lines , so that we could improve upon the previously published @xmath7-value of the 1370@xmath0  line using our value of @xmath51 as a comparison standard .",
    "this analysis yielded the result @xmath69 , which is 0.76 times the revised value of zsarg & federman ( 1998 ) given in morton s ( 2003 ) compilation of @xmath7-values ( and 0.45 times the value given in his earlier listing in 1991 , again based on the theoretical values of kurucz ) .",
    "our new result for @xmath52 differs from the rescaled value of zsarg & federman ( 1998 ) by less than their declared uncertainty of 30% .",
    "the transition probabilities listed by fritzsche et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( from their length calculations using experimentally determinied energies ) @xmath70 and @xmath71 are equivalent to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are respectively only 18% and 13% higher than our determinations .",
