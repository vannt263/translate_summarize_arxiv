    "it is well known that extremely high energy cosmic rays ( ehecr ) are subject to photopion production by interactions with primordial photons on traversal through intergalactic space , attenuating their energies down to 4@xmath10ev ( 40eev ) if their sources are distributed uniformly over cosmological distances . in this case",
    "the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays around 40eev are expected to be almost isotropic and some of them above 40eev may be correlated to the topological structure of nearby galaxies since the distance to their birth places is no further than 50mpc and the intergalactic magnetic field is at most 10@xmath11gauss @xcite .",
    "if powerful radio galaxies are sources of ehecr s a correlation of their arrival directions on the sky with the supergalactic ( sg ) plane might be expected , as suggested by biermann and stanev @xcite , since extragalactic radio sources concentrate towards the sg plane and this concentration extends to at least z @xmath12 0.02 , based on the mrc catalog measured at molonglo covering the declination band between 18.5@xmath13 and -18.5@xmath13 @xcite . in 1995 stanev et al .",
    "@xcite studied the arrival direction of cosmic rays with energies greater than 40eev and found that they exhibit a good correlation with the direction of the sg plane .",
    "the magnitude of the observed excess is 2.5@xmath14 , in terms of gaussian probabilities .",
    "they used 42 events of the world data published at that time with 27 events being from the haverah park experiment .",
    "the agasa group claimed @xcite that three doublets of showers with angular separation of less than 2.5@xmath13 ( consistent with the experimental resolution ) are observed among the 36 events above 40eev , corresponding to a chance probability of 2.9% from a uniform distribution , but noted that a significant fraction of ehecr s are uniformly distributed over the observable sky .",
    "two of three doublets are observed within 2.0@xmath13 of the sg plane .",
    "adding the agasa data up to august , 1998 and reevaluating the energies and arrival directions of all agasa events , takeda et al .",
    "@xcite found one triplet and three doublets in a total of 47 events . the chance probability is smaller than 1 % and",
    "the significance increased with the increased data set .",
    "it is interesting to note that the centroids of the triplet and one of the doublets are 0.7 and 0.9 degrees off the sg plane respectively .    in the northern hemisphere , four surface array experiments at volcano ranch ( vr ) ,",
    "haverah park ( hp ) , yakutsk ( yk ) and akeno ( ag ) have been operational so far and , with 81 events above 40eev , we have reported in @xcite that a significant number of doublets and triplet are observed around the sg plane with a chance probability less than 1 % supporting the agasa result .",
    "it is important now to examine whether the significance of such a clustering of ehecr s in the sky in correlation with the sg plane increases or not when using the world data set which includes the new published agasa data . if clusters along the sg plane are real , source models which do not relate to the sg plane may find difficulty in explaining the observations .    in this report",
    "we examine the arrival direction distribution of the events so far published by the four experiments in the northern hemisphere .",
    "while we report rather low probabilities of various occurrences we emphasis that we regard these claims as charting the way for the analysis of future , independent data sets rather than as providing conclusive evidence of anisotropy .",
    "the experimental data reported by vr @xcite , hp @xcite , yk @xcite and ag @xcite are used in the following analysis .",
    "the fly s eye events have differing error ellipses , event by event @xcite , which makes the estimation of the chance probability complicated and the exposure in right ascension of the fly s eye instrument is less uniform than that of the ground arrays .",
    "hence they are not included in the present analysis .",
    "experimental details for the four experiments and conditions for the present analysis are summarized in table [ tab : site ]",
    ". only extensive air showers ( eas ) with zenith angles within 45@xmath13 are used in the present analysis to select eas of good quality in energy and arrival direction determination .",
    "the arrival directions are determined by the arrival time of the shower front at different detectors , resulting in the estimated directional uncertainties evaluated by each experiment as listed in table [ tab : site ] for 40eev events .",
    "the method of energy estimation is different in each experiment . in this report",
    "we use 92 extensive air showers whose energies are estimated to be above 40eev by each experiment and do not normalize the energy between experiments .",
    "the observable sky is different for each experiment and is not uniform in declination . in the case of the ground array experiments listed in table [ tab : site ] ,",
    "the right ascension distribution is almost uniform .",
    "the declination distributions for observed events above 10eev is , however different for each experiment as it depends upon the latitude of the array and detector type , as shown in figure [ fig : decl_ga ] .",
    "since the triggering efficiency of each experiment becomes uniform over their array area above 10eev , the declination distribution of observed events above 40eev in each experiment is similar to that above 10eev .      to study the general arrival direction distribution of 92 events , the latitude distribution in galactic ( g ) and sg coordinates",
    "are shown in figure [ distribution ] .",
    "solid lines show the sum of the expected distributions assuming a uniform incident arrival direction distribution for each experiment ; a uniform distribution in right ascension and the observed declination distributions of figure [ fig : decl_ga ] are used to obtain these curves .",
    "there are no statistically significant deviations from uniformity in g coordinates . in the sg",
    "coordinate system , there is some excess between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but it is not statistically significant .",
    "most ehecr s , then , are found to be uniformly distributed over the observable sky .      in figures",
    "[ sky_map_eqc ] and [ sky_map_glx ] , the arrival directions of each event from the four arrays are plotted in equatorial and galactic coordinates , respectively .",
    "some coincidences of events coming from similar direction are apparent . in the following",
    "we estimate the chance probability of such coincidences arising from a uniform incident arrival direction distribution .",
    "an estimate of the space angle scatter due to errors in the arrival direction determination is obtained by quadrature addition of the uncertainties of table [ tab : error ] and ranges from @xmath17 , depending on the relevant combination of experimental uncertainties .",
    "since 80 % of all events are from agasa and haverah park , it is sufficient to examine clusters within @xmath18 for combined data set .",
    "the number of triplets and doublets within space angles of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are listed in table [ tab : prob ] . in counting doublets in this table ,",
    "each triplet is also decomposed into 3 doublets corresponding to the possible pair combinations with differing space angle separations .",
    "so there are actually 2 triplets and 6 independent doublets within a space angle @xmath19 , but the 2 triplets are also counted as 6 doublets , making a total of 12 doublets as listed in the table . to estimate the probability of obtaining such clusters by chance from a uniform distribution , we simulated the same number of events from each experiment .",
    "1,000,000 data sets , each comprising 92 showers , were simulated under the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the declination distributions of ag , hp and yk events are approximated by smooth functions as shown by the solid lines in figure [ fig : decl_ga ] .",
    "the ag declination distribution is used to simulate the vr data set .",
    "a uniform distribution in right ascension with the observed declination distributions is assumed for all experiments .    in figure",
    "[ fig : prob_clust ] the frequency distributions of the number of doublets found by simulation of 1,000,000 data sets within three different space angles separations are shown .",
    "the arrow shows the observed number of doublets .",
    "the chance probability of observing doublets is calculated as that fraction of the simulated data sets which have equal , or more doublets than observed .",
    "the chance probabilities of observing triplets or doublets within the three space angles separations are listed in table [ tab : prob ] .",
    "the probability is small only for clustering within 3@xmath13 .",
    "the chance probabilities for clustering within 4@xmath13 and 5@xmath13 , are larger than 10 % and hence not statistically significant .",
    "the arrival directions of ehecr of the four ground array experiments are plotted in the sg coordinate system in figure [ fig : skyplot_sg ] .",
    "error circles are also shown ; @xmath22 in the case of ag , and @xmath23 for hp , vr and yk .",
    "note that the two centroid of triplets are in a very narrow region ( within 0.9 degrees ) about the sg plane .",
    "an estimate of the chance probabilities of obtaining this number of doublets within @xmath1 from the sg plane is shown in figure [ fig : prob_sg ] . in this analysis ,",
    "only the number of doublets within @xmath1 region is counted and compared between observed data and simulated data , without taking into account doublets outside this region . in table",
    "[ tab : prob_sg ] the chance probabilities of doublets and triplets within @xmath1 from the sg plane are listed . whilst the choice of a cut at 10 degrees about the sg plane is arbitrary",
    ", we note that the chance probabilities for doublets within all space angle separations , and for triplets within the two smaller space angle cuts , are intriguingly below 1 % .",
    "as figure [ distribution ] indicates , there is about a 20 % excess of events in the latitude band @xmath24 about the sg plane .",
    "though this excess is only a one @xmath25 effect , it may contribute to the apparently significant clustering estimated above , so we have also calculated the chance probability of multiplets , given a uniform distribution within this band but with a total event number excess of 20 % .",
    "the result is listed in table [ tab : prob_excess ] . as expected the statistical evidence for clustering",
    "is reduced somewhat ( the chance probability is raised by approximately a factor 2 ) , but for doublets within 4@xmath13 the chance probability remains below 1 % .    to examine the effect of the choice of coordinates , the analysis is repeated for the g coordinate system .",
    "there are no multiplets found , even for the largest space angles ( within 5@xmath13 ) and within @xmath26 of the g plane .",
    "the average number of doublets expected by chance is 2.8 .",
    "the poisson probability of observing no multiplets is thus 6 % . considering that the number of events within @xmath26 of the g plane is about 30 % less than that expected from uniformity ( see fig.2 ) , this probability is statistically reasonable .",
    "the details of each event which are members of one of the clusters within 4@xmath13 are listed in table [ tab : events ] .",
    "here one hp event is counted twice ( doublet # 5 and # 8) , since it forms a doublet with another hp event , and with a vr event .",
    "clearly some , at least , of these multiplets must arise by chance . in an attempt to select genuinely coincident events from sources at limited distances",
    ", it may be better to only use events above a slightly higher energy threshold , to avoid the systematic differences in energy determination of each experiment . selecting only events above @xmath27 ev , two triplets and one doublet ( # 7 ) remain , from a total number of 51 events .",
    "the chance probability of the triplet is now 1.1 % , falling to 0.1 % if we examine only the restricted region within @xmath1 of the sg plane .",
    "the order of arrival times with respect to energy of the events in triplet#1 are not as expected from a recent , nearby bursting source where cosmic rays are accerelated in a short time @xcite . according to simulations on the propagation of protons through both the intergalactic and galactic magnetic fields by medina tanco @xcite",
    ", the extragalactic magnetic field must be much smaller than the present upper limit of 10@xmath11 g to explain the present clustering within experimental angular resolution .    in the case of triplet # 2 ,",
    "the direction is consistent with the ursa - major ii cluster of galaxies .",
    "the magnetic field strength in this cluster of galaxies is possibly of the order of sub-@xmath28 g , similar to that observed in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "if so , each member of the triplet might be a gamma - ray , because protons may not be collimated within @xmath29 and the mean distance of travel before decay for neutrons is 1 mpc for 10@xmath30 ev .",
    "since the cross - section of pair creation by gamma - rays of this energy and the probability of bremsstrahlung of the resulting electrons are suppressed due to the relativistic contraction of the atmosphere ( lpm effect @xcite ) , the longitudinal development of a gamma - ray shower is greatly depressed and delayed . a ground array , therefore ,",
    "might grossly underestimate the primary energy of such a shower if it is estimated by the local particle density around 600 m from the shower core @xcite .",
    "however , if the geomagnetic field component normal to the arrival direction is large enough , electron - positron pair creation in the geomagnetic field occurs far from the earth and a cascade develops in the stratoshpere@xcite .",
    "therefore in the northern hemisphere we might observe gamma - ray showers in the highest energy region mainly from a northerly direction @xcite .",
    "the terrestrial arrival directions of the three members of triplet # 2 are indeed from the north , which is at least consistent with this conjecture . however , it should be noted that the attenuation length of gamma - rays of energies above @xmath0 ev due to the interaction on radio photons is less than 10 mpc @xcite and hence a source distance limit also applies for gamma - rays .",
    "if each member of the triplets are protons , coming from the same source , then the intervening magnetic field must be so weak that the particles are hardly deflected , or there is magnetic focusing in the magnetic field structure of the local supercluster as demonstrated by lemoine et al .",
    "@xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cfa ] , the directions of triplets ( open squares ) and doublets ( open circles ) are plotted on the cfa galaxy @xcite distribution within 100 mpc .",
    "there are no multiplets from the most crowded region ( virgo cluster ) and there seems no correlation with the density of nearby galaxies . in the following we look for any source candidate for the triplets # 1 and # 2 , and the doublet # 7 .",
    "the ag highest energy event and hp 10@xmath30 ev event are members of the triplet # 1 and this triplet may be related to a nearby source .",
    "mrk 359 ( l= 134.60@xmath13 , b=-42.87@xmath13 ) with z=0.017 ( 68 mpc assuming @xmath31=75 km / s / mpc ) is within 2.3@xmath13 from the direction of the centroid of this triplet .",
    "this direction is also within 3 and 6 degrees of a clusterings of events with energies above 10@xmath32 ev claimed by chi et al .",
    "( l@xmath33 , b@xmath34 ) @xcite and efimov and mikhailov ( ra=27@xmath13 , dec=18@xmath13 or l=143@xmath13 , b=-42@xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "al - dargazelli et al .",
    "@xcite pointed that the colliding galaxy pair vv338 ( l=138@xmath13 , b=-34@xmath13 ) ( n672 and u1249 ) may be related to the clustering around the region l=135@xmath13 and b=-35@xmath13 , where they identified an apparent clustering above 10@xmath32 ev .",
    "though vv338 is very close , 5.7 mpc , the angular separation from triplet # 1 is large ( 9.0@xmath13 ) .",
    "triplet # 2 comprises three ag events of similar energies , ( 5 - 8)@xmath10 ev , and is within 2.4@xmath13 from the direction of the interacting galaxy , vv144 ( mkn40 or arp151 ; l=147.03@xmath13 , b=58.54@xmath13 ) .",
    "this is a seyfert galaxy with z=0.020 , corresponding to about 81 mpc .",
    "triplet # 2 is on top of a maximum in the arrival direction probability simulated by medina tanco @xcite for sources located between 20 and 50 mpc .",
    "these simulations assume that the luminous matter in the nearby universe tracks the distribution of cosmic ray sources and modulates the intensity of igmf .    in the direction of doublet # 7",
    ", there are interacting galaxies vv101 ( l=87.06@xmath13 , b=33.75@xmath13 , 100 mpc ) with a space angle separation of 1.3@xmath13 and vv89 ( l=88.14@xmath13 , b=35.51@xmath13 , 14.5 mpc ) with a separation of 2.7@xmath13 .    from the above discussion ,",
    "if the extragalactic magnetic field is much weaker than the present upper limit of 10@xmath11 g , then triplets # 1 and # 2 and doublet # 7 are possibly correlated with interacting galaxies , as pointed out by al - dargazelli et al @xcite .",
    "clearly , the next generation experiments are needed to confirm such an association .",
    "recently lemoine et al .",
    "@xcite made extensive simulations of the propagation of protons in a large scale magnetic field of strength @xmath35 g in the local supercluster .",
    "they found an 8 - 20 % probability of detecting 5 doublets above 40 eev in the agasa data set of 47 events , due to magnetic focusing .",
    "it is important to examine what kind of conditions are required for the magnetic field configuration in the local supercluster to explain the present results of two triplets along the sg plane .",
    "a number of collimated triplets and doublets within 4@xmath13 ( the approximate angular resolution of combined data set ) are observed .",
    "the chance probability is of the order of 10 % and is not statistically significant .",
    "however , the chance of observing triplets and doublets within @xmath1 of the sg plane is less than 1 % .",
    "it should be noted that the probability of observing the multiplets above 5@xmath36 ev is about 1 % and it is less than 0.1 % if attention is limited to within @xmath1 of the sg plane .",
    "though there is still a possibility of chance coincidence , we should pay more attention on the small angle clustering along the sg plane in the interpretation of ehecr enigma .",
    "we expect detailed investigation with much better angular resolution and much higher statistics from future experiments .",
    "in particular we note that the probabilities given in this paper are a postiori in that hints of clustering have been reported in earlier analysis and these data have been included here .",
    "there are insufficient events for an independent test of our observations .",
