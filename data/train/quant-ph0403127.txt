    "there is a growing belief that quantum computers can solve certain computational problems exponentially faster than any classical computer .",
    "strong evidence for this belief comes in the form of shor s algorithm @xcite for factorisation , and the graph traversal algorithm of childs _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite .",
    "despite the spectacular success of the known quantum algorithms we believe that there is still only a fairly rudimentary understanding of the properties of quantum mechanics which are useful for computational speedups .",
    "we ascribe this poor understanding to at least two causes : ( i ) we are unsure what sorts of problems might be amenable to quantum - computational speed up ; and ( ii ) even if we firmly believed that an efficient quantum algorithm existed for a problem , it is hard to come up with this putative algorithm because it is difficult ( at least for us ) to reason within the traditional quantum computing model  the quantum circuit model .",
    "all quantum algorithms are traditionally expressed in the quantum circuit model ( see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed description of the quantum circuit model ) .",
    "the quantum circuit model assigns a unit cost to certain elementary quantum gates , such as , for example , cnot , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( the @xmath10 phase gate ) .",
    "this is by no means the only way to express quantum algorithms .",
    "three other computing paradigms are polynomially equivalent to the quantum circuit model : the quantum turing machine model @xcite , the one - way quantum computer @xcite , and the adiabatic evolution model ( which has recently been shown to be polynomially equivalent to the quantum circuit model in @xcite )",
    ".    why might one want to consider computational paradigms other than the quantum circuit model ?",
    "the reason is that there are conceptual peculiarities with the quantum circuit model which make it hard to work with when designing algorithms the traditional way .",
    "firstly , there is a back - action that quantum superposition induces in gates like the cnot where there can be a `` backwards '' flow of quantum information for certain initial states .",
    "secondly , the existence of quantum entanglement seriously confuses the causal structure of quantum circuits because we can think of a bell pair as sending a qubit backwards in time ! however , in favour of the quantum circuit model is the fact that exponentially many degrees of freedom can be summarised succinctly .",
    "some of the negative features of the quantum circuit model are amply addressed in the quantum walk model of computation .",
    "quantum walks , or the quantum dynamics of a free particle hopping on a graph , are an exciting new paradigm for quantum computing .",
    "( for a review of quantum walks see @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the attractiveness of quantum walks is that they provide an extremely intuitive way to _ visualise _ exponentially many quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast to the quantum circuit model , in a quantum walk there is a clear physical picture of _ where _ information is flowing and a definite notion of _ cause and effect_. the price we pay for these intuitive features is that the exponentially ( @xmath5 for @xmath11 qubits ) many degrees of freedom of @xmath11 qubits translate to exponentially vertices in the graph .",
    "additionally , there is no clear way to translate a quantum walk efficiently into the quantum circuit model . despite these difficulties we believe that quantum walks provide an attractive methodology in the quantum algorithm designer s toolkit because they appeal to the geometrical intuitions .",
    "the growing number of quantum - walk algorithms might be seen as evidence for the conceptual utility of the quantum walk model .",
    "we mention three recent algorithms : ( i ) the quantum walk search algorithm @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; ( ii ) the graph - traversal algorithm of childs _ et .",
    "_  @xcite ; and ( iii ) the element distinctness algorithm of ambainis @xcite , and relatives @xcite .    what unites the quantum walk algorithms ?",
    "( and , more ambitiously , all quantum algorithms ? ) let s concentrate on the results of @xcite , which are based on the continuous - time quantum walk .",
    "( note that the quantum walks on the hypercube @xcite and the graphs in @xcite do nt provide the speedups for the solution to any algorithmic problem . )",
    "the results in these papers appear to be related phenomena ( they all take advantage of `` column spaces '' ) , however , this relationship has not yet , to the best of our knowledge , been quantified fully . in this paper",
    "we identify and generalise the combinatorial property of these graphs which leads to small hitting times .",
    "we believe this is a key ingredient underlying quantum speedups of hitting times .",
    "the combinatorial property we isolate is that all of the graphs walked on in these papers are covering spaces for much smaller graphs .          what is a covering space ?",
    "suppose that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are arcwise - connected and locally arcwise - connected topological spaces , respectively .",
    "then @xmath12 is said to be a covering space of @xmath1 if @xmath13 is a surjective continuous map with every @xmath14 having an open neighborhood @xmath15 such that every connected component of @xmath16 is mapped homeomorphically onto @xmath15 by @xmath17 .",
    "the preimage of a point in @xmath1 is called a _ fibre _ of @xmath17 .",
    "an example covering space is shown in figure  [ fig : cover ] .    in this paper",
    "we will show that a continuous - time quantum walk on a graph @xmath0 which is a covering space for another graph @xmath1 ( in the natural topology ) is isomorphic to a quantum walk on @xmath1 , under certain specific circumstances .",
    "this equivalence occurs when the walk starts on _ fibre - constant _ quantum states .",
    "additionally , we will argue , and show in some cases , that if there is a tower of covering spaces @xmath18 then there is an efficient gate sequence ( i.e.  using @xmath6 elementary gates ) for the quantisation of @xmath0 .",
    "the idea we exploit is to recursively and hierarchically construct the gate sequence from the `` elementary gate '' @xmath19 and the specification of how @xmath19 lives in @xmath20 .",
    "we believe that these results are not specific to continuous - time quantum walks , but rather _ indicative _ of a general principle .",
    "we formulate this principle in the following way : consider some collection of mathematical objects like the class of simple graphs , or something with more structure , like the class of finite fields .",
    "let @xmath21 be a quantisation scheme for this class of objects , by which we mean a way to associate a unitary matrix @xmath21 acting on a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath22 with any object @xmath1 .",

    "walks we expect that if @xmath18 is a tower of covering spaces obeying some uniformity and growth conditions then there should be an efficient gate sequence for the quantisation @xmath21 .",
    "we retroactively argue that there is an example of where this philosophy has already proven successful . in this example",
    "we take as our space of mathematical objects the category @xmath25 of finite groups .",
    "we take the quantisation scheme to be the contravariant functor which associates the quantum fourier transform with every finite group .",
    "( for an introduction to category theory see @xcite . ) for certain towers of subgroups , i.e.  those which are _ polynomially uniform _",
    "@xcite , there is an efficient hierarchical scheme to construct the quantisation @xmath23 .",
    "here we are taking the `` is a subgroup '' relation to be the covering space relation in this category . to accord this",
    "exactly with the definition of covering space given earlier requires the introduction of an appropriate topology on a finite group .",
    "this is something we will avoid , preferring only this qualitative argument  clearly the analogy is nt perfect .",
    "what sort of problems could these supposed efficient quantisations solve ?",
    "we will argue that they could be used to solve a problem we call the _ hidden covering space _ problem which includes the hidden subgroup problem as a subclass . roughly speaking ,",
    "if there is a function @xmath26 on @xmath0 which is periodic on some object @xmath1 covered by @xmath0 , then a quantum computer should be able to identify the structure @xmath1 efficiently .",
    "the general properties of covering spaces are extremely tantalising and suggestive .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that the results we have found concerning graph covering spaces and continuous - time quantum walks are indicative of a much larger framework .",
    "we believe that many quantum algorithms exhibiting an exponential separation between classical and quantum complexity could exist .",
    "we argue that the properties of quantisations of covering spaces may provide many opportunities to design such new algorithms .",
    "this is not least because covering spaces are pervasive in mathematics , from number fields and algebraic surfaces to geometric group theory , and , of course , galois theory .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : graphquant ] by describing the quantisation scheme we study in the remainder of this paper , the continuous - time quantum walk . in  [ sec : graphcover ] we review the theory of graph covering spaces and the heat kernel for graphs .",
    "we then apply these results in  [ sec : indqw ] to demonstrate that quantum walks which begin on fibre - constant states are isomorphic to quantum walks on smaller graphs .",
    "we illustrate our results in  [ sec : examples ] for the hypercube and cayley graphs . in ",
    "[ sec : efficient ] we utilise the covering - space properties of the @xmath3-torus graph on @xmath5 vertices to construct an efficient gate sequence for their quantisation . motivated by our results we introduce , in ",
    "[ sec : hiddencover ] , a new class of problem , hiddencover , which quantum computers may be able to solve efficiently .",
    "we also solve the hidden cover problem for the @xmath3-torus graph which , incidentally , provides a ( philosophically ) different way to solve the abelian hidden subgroup problem .",
