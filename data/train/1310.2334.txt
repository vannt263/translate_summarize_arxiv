    "since its discovery @xcite the superconductivity in iron - based compounds remains one of the most active research frontiers for the past few years @xcite .",
    "of particular importance is the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity in these materials .",
    "the iron - based scs are multi - band materials with conduction bands derived from iron @xmath4 orbitals and pnictide @xmath5orbitals @xcite .",
    "the fe sublattice has a simple tetragonal form with 1 atom per unit cell , and the corresponding fe - only brillouin zone ( bz ) is a rectangular parallelepiped . throughout the paper",
    "we will refer to fe - only bz as 1febz or , equivalently , unfolded bz . according to both angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite and density functional theory ( dft ) , most of fe - pnictides have a quasi two - dimensional band structure with two hole pockets centered at the @xmath6-point , and two electron pockets at @xmath7 and @xmath8 in 1febz . in some systems",
    ", there is an additional 3d hole fs near @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is widely believed that in most fe - pnictides superconducting order parameter ( op ) has @xmath3 symmetry @xcite .",
    "such an op changes sign between the hole and electron pockets and has a full lattice symmetry .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering experiments done on these systems revealed a spin resonance peak with the largest intensity at the neutron scattering momentum close to @xmath7 in 1febz @xcite . the spin resonance in fescs can be explained naturally within the @xmath3 scenario , because @xmath7 and @xmath8 are momenta separating electron and hole pockets at which @xmath3 gap has opposite signs  @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on superconductivity in recently discovered iron selenides a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( afe@xmath2se@xmath2 ) intercalated by an alkali metal , a = k , rb , cs @xcite .",
    "these superconductors with @xmath11k @xcite are isostructural with 122 family of fe - pnictides .",
    "selenides differ from pnictides by a pronounced normal state transport anomalies and the presence of iron vacancies .",
    "superconductivity in afe@xmath2se@xmath2 is present simultaneously with local spin magnetism @xcite , but the two are very likely separated into spatially distinct domains .",
    "several studies suggest that the superconductivity exists in stoichiometric domains without magnetic moments@xcite , while iron - vacancies are concentrated in magnetic domains where they order  @xcite .",
    "although the exact relationship between the magnetism and superconductivity is not yet settled , we believe there is enough evidence to separate superconductivity from local magnetism and consider superconductivity within an effective itinerant low - energy model , without fe vacancies .    unlike in pnictides , where the fermi surface has both electron and hole pockets , in selenides only electron pockets are present , according to arpes @xcite .",
    "the two largest fermi pockets are centered at @xmath7 and @xmath8 in xy plane , and evolve as functions of @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) .",
    "hole pockets are lifted by about @xmath13 from the fs@xcite .",
    "arpes studies  @xcite found an additional 3d electron pocket centered at @xmath9 and at @xmath14 .",
    "because hole pockets are absent , the conventional scenario for @xmath3 superconductivity due to interaction between low - energy fermions near electron and hole pockets is questionable .",
    "it has been listed as possible explanation of the data@xcite ( and termed as the `` incipient '' @xmath3 order ) , however because hole states are gapped , @xmath15 for such oder comes out noticeably lower than in fe - pnictides @xcite , in disagreement with the data .",
    "several alternative scenarios have been proposed , with the emphasize on the interaction between electron pockets , potentially enhanced by magnetic fluctuations at momentum separating the two electron pockets ( i.e. , at momentum @xmath16 in 1febz ) .",
    "strong inter - pocket interaction is necessary to overcome intra - pocket repulsion .",
    "two scenarios propose a conventional pairing of fermions with momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 on one electron pocket due to interaction with fermions near the other pocket .",
    "one proposal@xcite is that inter - pocket interaction is strong and repulsive . in this case , the system develops a superconducting order in which the gap changes sign between the two electron pockets .",
    "such a gap necessarily has @xmath19wave symmetry because it changes sign under the rotation from @xmath20 to @xmath21 axis .",
    "another proposal  @xcite is that inter - pocket interaction is strong and attractive .",
    "this happens when , e.g. , the underlying microscopic model is taken as the itinerant version of @xmath22 model with spin - spin interaction .",
    "then a superconducting gap does not change sign between electron pockets , i.e. , superconducting state is a conventional @xmath23wave .",
    "each of the two scenarios agrees with some experiments and disagrees with the others .",
    "a near - constant gap has been observed on a small 3d electron pocket centered at z -point",
    "( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) . taken at a face value ( i.e. , assuming that this is not a surface effect ) ,",
    "this result is consistent with @xmath23wave gap and rules out @xmath19wave . on the other hand",
    ", a spin resonance has been observed below @xmath15 in inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "if the resonance mode is a spin - exciton , as it is believed to be the case in fe - pnictides and other unconventional superconductors  @xcite , it requires a sign change of the gap .",
    "the observation of the resonance then rules out a conventional sign - preserving @xmath23wave and was interpreted as an argument for a d - wave gap  @xcite .",
    "there exists , however , another problem with the @xmath19wave state , even if we forget momentarily about arpes measurements on the @xmath26-pocket .",
    "namely , specific heat and other data on afe@xmath2se@xmath2 show  @xcite that there are no nodes in the superconducting gap . in a given 2d cross - section , @xmath19wave state due to repulsion between electron pockets",
    "yields a `` plus - minus '' gap , which is seemingly nodeless .",

    "the folding without hybridization results in the two fermi pockets in the corners of folded bz , which overlap either only at a particular @xmath36 , in the case of strong dispersion ( panel a ) , or along vertical lines in the case of weak dispersion ( panel c ) . for strong dispersion ,",
    "the two fermi surfaces in each cross - section at a given @xmath12 are elliptical , except for @xmath36 , where they are near - circular ( more precisely , @xmath37 symmetric ) .",

    "there exists a third scenario  @xcite , which alleviates the contradiction between arpes and neutron scattering data and is consistent with the measurements which show a no - nodal gap .",
    "namely , the same interaction which gives rise to a `` plus - minus '' d - wave state in which cooper pairs are made out of fermions on the same pocket also gives rise to an s - wave state in which pairing at least partly involves pairing between fermions belonging to different pockets .",
    "this `` other '' s - wave state is best understood once one converts to the actual ( physical ) bz with two fe atoms in the unit cell ( 2febz ) and includes the hybridization between the pockets , which splits them into bonding and anti - bonding fermi pockets which we will label as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the `` other '' s - wave gap remains roughly constant along each pocket after hybridization , but changes sign between them , @xmath43 .",
    "we recall that the hybridization in 122 compounds can be traced to the checkerboard arrangement of pnictogen / chalcogene atoms staggered above and below the iron planes , @xcite .",

    "we first discuss , as a warm - up , the artificial limit of zero hybridization and then discuss the actual case when the hybridization is finite ( and strong enough to favor the @xmath3 state over the @xmath19wave state ) .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "naively , the spin resonance is inevitable in the presence of the sign - changing op .",
    "the reasoning is that for sign - changing op , superconductivity simultaneously gives rise to two features in the spin response : ( i ) it gives rise to a gap @xmath77 in the spin excitations spectrum and ( ii ) spin component of the residual interaction between fermions is attractive .",
    "the combination of these two conditions gives rise to the excitonic resonance below @xmath77 .",
    "the residue of the resonance peak at momentum between bonding and anti - bonding fermi surfaces is proportional to the spin coherence factor , @xmath78 , and the latter is non - zero if the op has opposite sign on bonding ( @xmath41 ) and anti - bonding ( @xmath42 ) bands .",
    "however , this condition is _ necessary _ but not _",
    "sufficient_. to see this , neglect momentarily the ellipticity of electron pockets and the @xmath12 dispersion , i.e. , approximate each pocket by a circular cylinder .",
    "bonding and anti - bonding states are then the sum and the difference of the states of the original ( non - hybridized fermions ) . in operator notations , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and subindices @xmath83 and @xmath84 label electron pockets .",
    "one can easily verify@xcite that in real space bonding and anti - bonding states reside on even and odd fe - sublattices respectively , and do not overlap .",
    "for that reason , the spin operator has zero matrix elements between them , hence the residue of the resonance vanishes .",
    "another way to understand this argument is to note that the spin operator does not discriminate between the two original pockets before the hybridization , i.e. , it is symmetric under the exchange @xmath85 .",
    "since bonding and anti - bonding states have opposite parity under this operation , the symmetric spin operator can not induce transitions between them .",
    "the above argument , however , applies only to fermi pockets in the form of circular cylinders . in reality , the original pockets are not circular for a generic @xmath12 , and moreover hybridization and folding in 122 materials is a complex process in a three - dimensional bz , fig .",
    "[ f1_fold],[fig_insert ] .",
    "we show that the proper folding procedure by a vector , @xmath30 combined with the full three - dimensional band dispersion leads to @xmath3 state on bonding and anti - bonding fermi surfaces , for which the residue of the spin resonance is non - zero .",
    "one particular reason for the existence of the resonance is that the structure of the two fermi surfaces in 2febz is such that they strongly overlap only in a subset of points along @xmath12 axis .",
    "inside this range ( framed by rectangles in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) ) hybridization separates bonding and anti - bonding states into even and odd sublattice states with near - zero overlap and hence near - zero contribution to the resonance .",
    "however , in other regions of @xmath12 , the two pockets appear split already before hybridization . for these @xmath12 ,",
    "the effect of hybridization is minimal ( if , as we assume , hybridization is not too strong to exceed the energy difference between two split bands ) , and in real space each state resides on even and odd sublattices .",
    "the overlapping between the two states is then strong and the condition that the gap changes sign between the two fermi surfaces becomes not only necessary but also sufficient for the resonance .",
    "the same reasoning also holds for the case of cylindrical fss in 1febz ( no @xmath12 dependence ) , but with ellipses rather than circles in the cross - section .",
    "then again , the two electron pockets overlap only near particular @xmath86 , and in this @xmath70 range hybridization generates bonding and anti - bonding states residing on different sublattices .",
    "however , away from the overlapping region the original states from two electron pockets are already well separated , and hybridization does not constrain the states to either even or odd sublattices . in this situation , again , the sign change of the gap between the two fermi surfaces becomes not only necessary but also sufficient condition for the resonance .      in the next two sections we present a detailed account of our calculation of the dynamical structure factor @xmath87 . here",
    "we give a brief summary of our result for a reader not interested in technical details .",
    "we verified that in the limit of weak dispersion , the ellipticity of electron pockets in 1febz is necessary for the existence of resonance , as cylindrical pockets are strongly hybridized into bonding and anti - bonding states , which are not connected by the spin operator .",
    "as a result the residue of the resonance peak vanishes .",
    "in contrast , for finite ellipticity , a finite portion of the fermi surface remains unaffected by hybridization .",
