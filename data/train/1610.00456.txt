    "the second equation describes the production and ( instantaneous ) diffusion of the chemo - attractant .",
    "pks and related variants have received considerable mathematical attention over the years , for example , see the review @xcite or some of the following representative works @xcite .",
    "the equation is @xmath6 critical in dimension d , hence it is mass or @xmath7 critical in dimension 2 , namely : if @xmath8 is a solution to then for all @xmath9 , so is @xmath10 moreover , if @xmath11 then the second moment is also conserved .",
    "this justifies the terminology doubly critical if @xmath11 and yields very inetresting dynamical properties .",

    "another important property of that plays a decisive role in our work is the existence ( and uniqueness ) of self - similar spreading solutions for all mass @xmath14 .",
    "these are known to be global attractors for the dynamics if the total mass is less than @xmath0 @xcite and for the purposes of our analysis .",
    "the mass is conserved in : @xmath15 then we set @xmath16 notice that the center of mass is also conserved @xmath17 since the solution of the poisson equation @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 hence , the system becomes : @xmath20\\times{\\mathbb{r}}^2\\\\ u(0 ) & = u_0\\geq0 .",

    "the problem is locally well - posed in the finite borel measures space @xcite , but the question of global existence requires more conditions .",
    "indeed , we can formally compute a virial indentity for a solution of @xmath23    so that all solutions with finite second moment and mass bigger than @xmath0 can not be global in time , and we also have an estimation on the maximal existence time @xmath24 if the second moment of the initial data @xmath25 is finite , @xmath26 thus , this virial computation is a heuristic explanation of the following trichotomy :    * if @xmath27 solutions are global in time , and the solutions are spreading @xcite , and the density converges to a self - similar profile in rescaled variables . * if @xmath28 solutions blow up in finite time , and we have aggregation in finite time@xcite . * and",

    "however , there is another important one in @xcite where they proved the stablity of the blowup in addition to the description of the dynamic , but all of these results are for radial solutions .",
    "indeed , in @xcite they proved    * universality of the blow - up profile : for all @xmath40 @xmath41 with @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 * stability of the dynamic under small perturbation in @xmath45 .",
    "their proof is based on the modulation theory which is a strong method for critical problems .",
    "for example , it allows people to prove the stability and to describe the dynamic of the flow for the nonlinear schrodinger equation when the mass is critical @xcite , for the schrodinger map when the energy is critical @xcite . and also for the 1-corotational harmonic heat flow map when the energy is critical @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the critical mass case namely @xmath46 .",

    "the infinite speed of propagation of the heat semi group will send some mass to infinity almost instantly , and the concentration will occur only when all the mass @xmath0 is present again in the center of mass . while all the mass concentrate at the origin when @xmath50 , the second moment is ejected to infinity in space .",
    "the goal of the paper is to describe the dynamic in @xmath55 when the mass is critical @xmath46 and to prove the stability of that dynamic under pertubations of the initial data .",

    "the proof of the corollary is given in section 8 .",
    "let s explain the main ideas of the proof that we think could be applicable to many other critical problems .",
    "the main idea of the proof is to pass by the subcritical case to reach the critical one .",
    "indeed , the blowup profile of the solution @xmath4 of is the unique stationary solution @xmath82 , but we can not use the linearisation around that stationary solution because we need the second moment of @xmath4 to be finite and the mass to be @xmath0 . since , @xmath33 has an infinite second moment and @xmath0 mass , it seems natural to multiply @xmath33 by a cutoff function @xmath83 .",
    "however , @xmath84 does nt satisfy a good equation and has an uncontrollable error .",
    "the idea is to notice that the stationary solution of the subcritical case after rescaling converge uniformly to @xmath33 . indeed",
    ", if we rescale with the self similar variables when the mass @xmath85 is subcritical there exists for that @xmath85 a unique stationary solution @xmath86 which depends on @xmath85 and decays exponentially at infinity . actually , after another rescaling we prove that @xmath86 converges uniformly to @xmath33 when @xmath87 .    actually , we prove that @xmath86 after a certain rescaling behaves as @xmath33 multiplied by a cutoff function , but the advantage is that @xmath86 is a stationary solution of some related equation .",
    "the main difficulty now is that everything depends on the mass , i.e. the linearized operator and its spectrum , the energy and the norms that we are controlling . and since the mass is not fixed , we need that all the inequalities are uniform with respect to the mass .",
    "then , it appears a big difficulty in this problem , the energy that we are controlling is coercive but not uniformly with respect to the mass . to overcome this problem",
    ", we discovered an other bound on the energy coming from a property of the nonlinear term ( see proposition [ proposition : boundonphieps ] ) .",
    "classically , to describe the dynamic of the blowup we need to rescale the solution , and the best rescaling is the blowup speed @xmath88 .",
    "then we renormalize the previous equation with the following change of variable @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , where @xmath88 is an unknown of our problem and will be determined later",
    ". then we obtain @xmath92 where @xmath93 actually , we do nt rescale by @xmath88 directly , but we arrive to in 2 steps . in a first step we rescale by the self - similar variables to make the stationnary solution appear of the subcritical case . and in a second step we rescale by a certain parameter @xmath94 that will be defined later such that the combination of these two rescalings leads to .",
    "we first start in the second section to set the equations and the bootstrap argument . in the third section",
    "we prove the spectral gap estimate . in the fourth section",
    "we construct an approximate solution and in the fifth section we do the derivation of the blowup speed @xmath88 . in the sixth section",
    "we derive a uniform bound on the potential and in the last section we proof the rigorous control of the error @xmath95 .",
    "we think that the new method we present here that is solving the critical problem by passing to the limit in the subcritical problem is applicable to many others critical problems .",
    "our result is true for non radial solution under a spectral gap assumption , but in the radial case the spectral gap has been proved in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the speed of concentration that we derive rigorously from the conservation of the second moment is the one found formally by the physicist ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3.3 ) .",
