    "among the agb stars , a small fraction of carbon rich stars show an extreme variability reminiscent of the hotter rcrb supergiants , e.g. @xcite . erratic optical variability with large amplitude and dramatic spectral changes",
    "are the main signatures of these stars : the fast decline of several magnitudes in luminosity is interpreted as caused by enhanced mass loss events .",
    "the very extended atmospheres produce the ejection of clouds ( puffs ) where carbon rich dust condense in grains .",
    "the extinction events are attributed to these dust clouds in our line of sight : either a dust cloud is passing between the photosphere and us , or a sudden very strong ejection of dust by the star itself takes place .",
    "colour changes also occur , being the object redder when fainter .",
    "the photometric changes have spectacular spectroscopic fallout : molecular and atomic lines develop in emission during the fading to turn back in absorption when the star recovers the bright state @xcite .",
    "besides the optical variations , the infrared excess is a well known characteristics of the rcb and of their cooler counterpart , the dy per stars , showing a spectrum more similar to that of an ordinary n agb type supergiant ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the advent of several infrared satellites improved the wavelength coverage of the energy distribution and stimulated the use of mid infrared colour - colour diagrams to select new candidates , @xcite .",
    "differences and similarities have been extensively discussed and categorized although the behaviour of strongly variable agb stars makes them difficult to be identified unless located in well monitored fields , while scattered observations can yield to misclassification of possibly interesting objects .",
    "the case of v381lac ( also known as fbs 2213 + 421 ) is paradigmatic . over the years",
    "the star has been subject to periods of high luminosity and of rapid , severe obscuration episodes .",
    "classified as a dwarf nova by @xcite and by @xcite on the basis of the photometric variability , then as an m5-m6 star by @xcite from a low dispersion objective - prism plate of the first byurakan survey @xcite , it was finally recognised as a carbon star by @xcite . to clarify its nature we started since 2012 a photometric and spectroscopic campaign and collected the available data from literature and public catalogs .",
    "this paper is organised inthe following way : in section [ obs ] we describe the observational material . in section [ da ]",
    "we analyse the flux variability , the spectroscopic changes and the position of v381 lac in several infrared colour - colour plots . in section [ theo ]",
    "we present a possible interpretation of the spectral energy distribution on the basis of our evolutionary models for dusty carbon rich stars . in section [ concl ]",

    "one photometric point was also obtained with the roma university telescope ( tacor ) and one was kindly obtained for us by the ara association with the 37 cm telescope in frasso sabino .",
    "the data were reduced by means of standard iraf procedures .    to study the photometric history of v381 lac we have downloaded from mast and analysed the digitised images available from possi , possii and quick - v surveys in the @xmath8  and @xmath9   bandpasses .",
    "well sampled light curves were obtained from the nsvs- rotse telescope @xcite and the aavso archive . in the archives of asiago observatory we examined the plates of the field , obtained between 1967 and 1969 ; only an upper limit of @xmath10=17.7 mag could be derived .",

    "the star was in a relatively bright phase : only absorption features with sign of veiling were visible in the spectrum , while the evolution of the photometry from june to july indicated a new brightness decline .    besides the emission of na d and [ n ii ] during the fading phases , we remark the lack of hydrogen lines either in emission or absorption in all the new spectra , while in 2008 h@xmath22 was clearly present in absorption simultaneously with the na d doublet @xcite .",

    "is reported in red ( not reliable ) , the other magnitudes also changed , while the colours remain similar ; taking into account the large uncertainties in the new release too , we consider the above reported colours still acceptable , that locate the star in the zone populated by known rcb stars in figure 6 of @xcite .",

    "models of smaller mass can be ruled out by the present analysis , because they never reach the observed degree of obscuration .",

    "the formation of solid carbon increases the emission in the continuum .",
    "the presence of a significant percentage of sic , evident from the feature at @xmath49 in both models , is confirmed by the slight increase in the flux of the [ 12 ] band with respect to the other wise bands .    to interpret the 2012 observations ,",
    "when the sed exhibits a smaller degree of obscuration , we assume that the star experienced a phase of smaller mass loss , during which dust formation was suppressed .",
    "in this situation the radiation emitted from the central object is reprocessed by the dust layer formed during a previous phase of stronger mass loss , pushed outwards by effects of radiation pressure . in this configuration ( model 1 in fig .",

    "the spectral variations of v381 lac are strongly correlated with the optical flux , showing a behaviour reminiscent of rcb stars . at maximum ,",
    "continuum and spectral features are those of a typical n carbon giant . during decline , the photospheric absorptions are progressively diluted by the veiling due to repeated scattering of the light crossing the soot clouds that eclipse the photosphere .",
    "nad and [ nii ] doublets go in emission , with increasing intensity as stellar luminosity decreases .",
    "these lines , formed in the circumstellar envelope , are likely present with constant flux at all times , but are not visible during maxima , overwhelmed by the bright central object .",
    "extensive descriptions and explanations of these phenomena may be found e.g. in @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",

    "based on the fit of our theoretical models with the sed , v 381 lac is a carbon star with an initial mass @xmath53 during the last pulses of the agb phase . the central object with a luminosity around @xmath54 and effective temperature @xmath55 , is loosing the external envelope with a high rate ( @xmath56 ) producing a dense carbon - enriched wind .",

    "the dusty layers enshroud the star , obscuring the stellar radiation in the optical bands .",
    "phases of lower mass loss rate are followed by a decrease in the dust production and a consequent increase of the optical emission .",
    "we can not exclude the possible presence of a companion of v381 lac , capable to trigger strong mass loss events like in the case of v hya , where the obscuration phases do not occur with regular timing @xcite .",
    "we still do not have enough observing material to settle this issue : again , a long term spectroscopic ( at high resolution ) and photometric monitoring would be necessary to this purpose .",

    "<S> we have performed new medium resolution spectroscopy , optical and near infrared photometry to monitor the variability of the agb carbon star v 381 lac . </S>",
    "<S> our observations revealed rapid and deep changes in the spectrum and extreme variability in the optical and near infrared bands . </S>",
    "<S> most notably we observed the change of nai d lines from deep absorption to emission , and the progressive growing of the [ nii ] doublet 6548 - 6584  emission , strongly related to the simultaneous photometric fading . </S>",
    "<S> v381 lac occupies regions of 2mass and wise colour - colour diagrams typical of stars with dust formation in the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the general framework emerging from the observations of v381 lac is that of a cool agb carbon star undergoing episodes of high mass ejection and severe occultation of the stellar photosphere reminiscent of those characterising the rcb phenomenon .    comparing the spectral energy distribution obtained with the theoretical model for agb evolution with dust in the circumstellar envelope </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify v381 lac as the descendant of a star of initial mass @xmath02m@xmath1 , in the final agb phases , evolved into a carbon star by repeated third dredge up episodes . according to our model </S>",
    "<S> the star is moderately obscured ( @xmath2 ) by dust , mainly formed by amorphous carbon ( @xmath3 ) and sic ( @xmath4 ) , with dust grain dimensions around @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .    </S>",
