    "is complexity ? a great deal of research has been performed on the question in what sense some objects are `` more complicated '' than others , and how this fact and its consequences can be analyzed mathematically .",
    "one of the most well - known complexity measures is _ kolmogorov complexity _",
    "@xcite , also called _ algorithmic complexity _ or _ algorithmic information content_. in short , the kolmogorov complexity of some finite binary string @xmath0 is the length of the shortest computer program that produces @xmath0 on a universal computer .",
    "so kolmogorov complexity quantifies how well a string can in principle be compressed .",
    "this notion of complexity has found various interesting applications in mathematics and computer science .    despite its usefulness , kolmogorov complexity",
    "does not capture the intuitive notion of complexity very well .",
    "for example , random strings without any regularities , say strings that are constructed bitwise by repeated tosses of a fair coin , have very large kolmogorov complexity .",
    "but those strings are not `` complex '' from an intuitive point of view  those strings are completely random and do not carry any interesting structure at all .    _",
    "effective complexity _ is an attempt by m. gell - mann and s. lloyd  @xcite,@xcite to define some complexity measure that is closer to the intuitive notion of complexity and overcomes the difficulties of kolmogorov complexity .",
    "the main idea of effective complexity is to split the algorithmic information content of some string @xmath0 into two parts , its random features and its regularities .",
    "then , the effective complexity of @xmath0 is defined as the algorithmic information content of the regularities alone .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the basic properties of effective complexity , and how it relates to other complexity measures .",
    "in particular , we give a more precise formal definition of effective complexity than has been done previously .",
    "we use this formal framework to give detailed proofs of the properties of effective complexity , and we use it to show an unexpected relation between effective complexity and bennett s logical depth  @xcite .    since there are now so many different complexity measures  @xcite , our result contributes to the clarification of the interrelations within this `` zoo '' of complexity measures .",
    "moreover , we hope that our more formal approach helps to find applications of effective complexity within mathematics , in a similar manner as this has been done for kolmogorov complexity .",
    "we now describe our main results and give a synopsis of this paper :    * after some notational preliminaries in section  [ secpreliminaries ] , we motivate and state the main definition of effective complexity in section  [ seceffectivecomplexity ] . * in section  [",
    "sec : basicproperties ] , we analyze the basic properties of effective complexity . in particular , we show in theorem  [ thesimple ] that effective complexity indeed avoids the disadvantage of kolmogorov complexity that we have explained above : random strings are effectively simple .",
    "+ although the existence of effectively complex strings has been mentioned in @xcite , it has not been conjectured explicitly . based on the notion of algorithmic statistics as studied by gcs at al .",
    "@xcite we provide a formal existence proof , see theorem  [ thecomplex ] .",
    "* section  [ secdepth ] contains our main result ( theorem  [ theeffdepth ] and theorem  [ theeffdepth2 ] ) , the relation between effective complexity and logical depth . in short",
    ", it states that if the effective complexity of some string exceeds a certain explicit threshold , then the time it takes to compute that string from a short description must be astronomically large .",
    "this threshold is in some sense very sharp , such that the behavior of logical depth with respect to effective complexity is comparable to that of a phase transition ( cf . fig .",
    "[ figphasetransition ] on page  ) . * in section [ sec : ec - and - kmss ] we show how effective complexity is related to the notion of kolmogorov minimal sufficient statistics . * finally ,",
    "in the appendix , we give an explicit example of a computable ensemble on the binary strings that has non - computable entropy .",
    "this illustrates the necessity of the details of our definition in section  [ seceffectivecomplexity ] .",
    "we start by introducing notation .",
    "we denote the finite binary strings @xmath1 by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the empty string , and we write @xmath4 for the length of a binary string @xmath5 .",
    "an _ ensemble _",
    "@xmath6 is a probability distribution on @xmath2 .",
    "all logarithms are in base @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of kolmogorov complexity ; a good reference is the book by li and vitnyi @xcite .",
    "there is a `` plain '' and a `` prefix '' version of kolmogorov complexity , and we will use both of them in this paper . the plain kolmogorov complexity @xmath8 of some string @xmath0 is defined as the length of the shortest computer program that outputs @xmath0 if it is given as input to a universal computer @xmath9 , @xmath10 prefix kolmogorov complexity is defined analogously , but with respect to a universal _ prefix computer _ @xmath11 .",
    "a prefix computer @xmath11 has the property that if @xmath12 is defined for some string @xmath13 , then @xmath14 is undefined for every string @xmath15 that is not the empty string .",
    "so @xmath16 there are different possible choices of @xmath11 and @xmath9 ; we fix one of them for the rest of the paper .",
    "several variations of kolmogorov complexity can be easily defined and will be used in this paper , for example , the complexity of a finite list of strings , or the complexity of an integer or a real number . with a few exceptions below , we will not discuss the details of the definitions here and instead refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first exception that deserves a more detailed discussion is _",
    "conditional complexity_. there are two versions of conditional complexity , a `` naive '' one and a more sophisticated one .",
    "the naive definition is @xmath17 that is , the complexity of producing string @xmath0 , given string @xmath18 as additional `` free '' information . a more sophisticated version due to chaitin  @xcite reads @xmath19 that is",
    ", the complexity of producing @xmath0 , given a minimal program @xmath20 for @xmath18 .",
    "the advantage of @xmath21 compared with @xmath22 is the validity of a chain rule @xmath23 for all strings @xmath0 and @xmath18 . here",
    "we make use of a well - known notation  @xcite which helps to suppress additive constants : suppose that @xmath24 are functions on the binary strings , and there is some @xmath25 independent of the argument value @xmath13 such that @xmath26 for every @xmath27 , i.e. the inequality holds _ uniformly _ for @xmath27 .",
    "then we write @xmath28 we use the notation @xmath29 if both @xmath30 and @xmath31 hold .",
    "note that the `` naive '' form of conditional complexity as defined in ( [ eqdefnaiveconditional ] ) does not satisfy the chain rule ( [ chain - rule ] ) .",
    "only the weaker identity @xmath32 holds in general .",
    "we will often use obvious identities like @xmath33 or @xmath34 without explaining in detail where they come from ; we again refer the reader to the book by li and vitnyi  @xcite .",
    "another important prerequisite for this paper is the definition of the prefix kolmogorov complexity @xmath35 of some ensemble @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to bit strings , there are several inequivalent notions of a `` description '' , and we can learn from ref .",
    "@xcite the lesson that it is very important to exactly specify which of them we will use .",
    "our definition of @xmath35 for ensembles @xmath6 is as follows .",
    "first , a _ program that computes @xmath6 _ is a computer program that expects two inputs , namely a string @xmath27 and an integer @xmath36 , and that outputs ( the binary digits of ) an approximation of @xmath37 with accuracy of at least @xmath38 .",
    "then , our preliminary definition of @xmath35 is the length of the shortest program for the universal prefix computer @xmath11 that computes @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , not every ensemble @xmath6 is computable  there is a continuum of string ensembles , but there are only countably many algorithms that compute ensembles .",
    "another unexpected difficulty concerns the entropy of a computable ensemble , defined as @xmath39 .",
    "contrary to a first naive guess , the entropy of a computable ensemble does not need to be computable ; all we know for sure is that it is enumerable from below . to illustrate this",
    ", we give an explicit example of a computable ensemble with a non - computable entropy in example  [ exnonentropy ] in appendix  [ secappendix ] .",
    "thus , for the rest of the paper , * we assume that all ensembles are computable and have computable and finite entropy @xmath40 * , unless stated otherwise .    even when one restricts to the set of ensembles with computable entropy , the map @xmath41 is not necessarily a computable function .",
    "hence the approximate equality @xmath42 is not necessarily true uniformly in @xmath6 .",
    "thus , from now on we replace the preliminary definition @xmath35 by @xmath43 * i.e. we assume that computer programs for ensembles @xmath6 carry additionally a subprogram that computes the entropy @xmath40*.",
    "to define the notion of effective complexity , we follow the steps described in one of the original manuscripts by m. gell - mann and s. lloyd @xcite .",
    "first , they define the _ total information _ of an ensemble as the sum of the ensemble s entropy and complexity .    to understand the motivation behind this definition , suppose we are given some data @xmath0 ( a finite binary string ) which has been generated by an unknown stochastic process .",
    "we would like to make a good guess on the process that generated @xmath0 , even if we only have one sample of the process .",
    "this is similar to a scientist that tries to find a ( probabilistic ) theory of physics , given only the present state of the universe . to make a good guess on the probability distribution or ensemble @xmath6 that produced @xmath0 , we make two natural assumptions :    * the explanation should be simple . in terms of kolmogorov complexity , this means that @xmath35 should be small .",
    "* the explanation should not allow all possible outcomes , but should prefer some outcomes ( including @xmath0 ) over others .",
    "for example , the uniform distribution on a billion different possible physical theories is `` simple '' ( i.e. @xmath35 is small ) , but it is not a `` good explanation '' of our physical world because it contains a huge amount of arbitrariness .",
    "this arbitrariness can be identified with the `` measure of ignorance '' , the entropy of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , it is natural to demand that the entropy @xmath40 shall be small .    putting both assumptions together",
    ", it is natural to consider the sum @xmath44 which is called the `` total information '' @xmath45 .",
    "a `` good theory '' is then an ensemble @xmath6 with small @xmath45 .    ' '' ''    for every ensemble @xmath6 with entropy @xmath46 , we define the _ total information _ @xmath45 of @xmath6 as @xmath47    note that the total information is a real number larger than or equal to @xmath48 . if @xmath6 is computable and has finite entropy , as always assumed in this paper , then @xmath45 is finite .    in the subsequent work @xcite by m. gell - mann and s. lloyd ,",
    "it has been pointed out that @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that @xmath50 this has a nice interpretation : the total information gives the average complexity of computing a string with the detour of computing the ensemble .",
    "the next step in  @xcite is to explain what is meant by a string being `` typical '' for an ensemble .",
    "going back to the analogy of a scientist trying to find a theory @xmath6 explaining his data @xmath0 , a good theory should in fact predict that the appearance of @xmath0 has non - zero probability .",
    "even more , the probability @xmath51 should not be too small ; it should be at least as large as that of `` typical '' outcomes of the corresponding process .",
    "what is the probability of a `` typical '' outcome of a random experiment ?",
    "suppose we toss a biased coin with probability @xmath52 for heads and @xmath53 for tails @xmath54 times , and call the resulting probability distribution @xmath6 .",
    "then it turns out that typical outcomes @xmath0 have probability @xmath51 close to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the entropy of @xmath6 . in fact , the probability that @xmath51 lies in between @xmath58 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 tends to one as @xmath54 gets large . in information theory , this is called the `` asymptotic equipartition property '' ( cf .",
    "an appropriately extended version of this result holds for a large class of stochastic processes , including ergodic processes .",
    "this motivates to define that a string @xmath0 is _ typical _ for an ensemble @xmath6 if its probability is not much smaller than @xmath60 .    ' '' ''    let @xmath6 be an ensemble , @xmath5 a string and @xmath61 .",
    "we say that _ @xmath0 is @xmath62-typical for @xmath6 _ , if @xmath63    we return to the scenario of the scientist who looks for good theories ( ensembles @xmath6 ) explaining his data @xmath0 . as discussed above , it is natural to look for theories with small total information @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the theory should predict @xmath0 as a `` typical '' outcome of the corresponding random experiment , that is , @xmath0 should be @xmath62-typical for @xmath6 for some small constant @xmath62 .",
    "how small can the total information of such a theory be ?",
    "the next lemma shows that the answer is `` not too small '' .",
    "[ lemmintotalinfo ]    ' '' ''    it uniformly holds for @xmath5 and @xmath64 that @xmath65    * remark . *",
    "the upper bound @xmath66 and the computability of @xmath6 show that the set is finite , and the infimum is indeed a minimum .    fix some @xmath64 and some @xmath67 .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 is @xmath62-typical for the singlet distribution @xmath68 , given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 for every @xmath71 .",
    "this ensemble has entropy @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the total information @xmath73 equals the complexity @xmath74 .",
    "we also have @xmath75 as describing the ensemble @xmath68 boils down to describing the string @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding additive constant does not depend on @xmath0 or @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 .    to prove the converse , suppose @xmath6 is any ensemble such that @xmath0 is @xmath62-typical for @xmath6 .",
    "then we have the chain of inequalities @xmath77 the first two inequalities follow from general properties of prefix kolmogorov complexity , while the third inequality is due to the upper bound @xmath78 which follows from coding every string @xmath0 with @xmath79 into a prefix code word of length @xmath80 ( such a code exists due to the kraft inequality ) .",
    "moreover , ( [ ineq : typ_ensemble_estimate ] ) is a consequence of @xmath62-typicality of @xmath13 for @xmath6 , and ( [ ineq : eff_compl_def ] ) uses the definition of the total information @xmath81 .    ' '' ''    @xmath82    the ultimate goal of effective complexity is to assign a useful complexity measure @xmath83 to strings @xmath0 . in our analogy , this means that the scientist wants to assign a natural number to his data @xmath0 saying how `` complex '' @xmath0 is . simply taking the kolmogorov complexity @xmath66 as this value has important drawbacks : it does not at all capture the intuition that `` complexity '' should measure the `` amount of structure '' of an object .",
    "in fact , if @xmath0 is uniformly random ( i.e. the result of fair coin tossing ) , then @xmath66 is large , while the string possesses almost no structure at all .",
    "the strategy of s. lloyd and m. gell - mann  @xcite is instead to take that complexity @xmath35 of `` the best '' theory @xmath6 that explains the data @xmath0 .",
    "what is `` the best '' theory ?",
    "as already discussed , a good theory should have small total information @xmath45 , and the data @xmath0 should be `` typical '' for @xmath6 in the sense that the probability @xmath51 is not much smaller than @xmath60 .    given some data @xmath0 , there are always many `` good theories '' which satisfy these requirements .",

    "the convincing suggestion by m. gell - mann and s. lloyd is that the best theory is the simplest theory ; that is , the ensemble @xmath6 with the minimal kolmogorov complexity @xmath35 .",
    "the complexity @xmath35 of this minimizing ensemble is then defined as the effective complexity of @xmath0 . in other words , the effective complexity of @xmath0",
    "is defined as the smallest possible kolmogorov complexity of any `` good theory '' ( satisfying the two requirements ) for @xmath0 .",

    "it is often useful to extend this definition of effective complexity by imposing additional conditions ( `` constraints '' ) on the ensembles that are allowed in the minimization domain .",
    "there are basically two intuitive reasons why this is useful . to understand those reasons , we go back to the scenario of a scientist looking for good theories to explain his data @xmath0 . recall the interpretation of the minimization domain of effective complexity as the set of `` good theories '' for @xmath0 .",
    "reasons for considering constraints on the ensembles are :    * given the string @xmath0 , there might be _ certain properties _ of @xmath0 that the scientist _ judges to be important_. those properties should be explained by the theories in the sense that the properties are not just simple random coincidences , but necessary or highly probable properties of each outcome of the corresponding process .",

    "effective complexity is the kolmogorov complexity of the regularities of @xmath0 , thus , this scientist tends to find a larger value of effective complexity than other scientists who consider the fine structure constant as unimportant and random .",

    "this situation is often encountered in thermodynamics .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 encodes some microscopic properties of a gas in a container that a scientist has measured .",
    "in addition to these measurement results , the scientist typically also has information on several _ macroscopic observables _ like the temperature or the total energy in the box  at least , crude upper bounds are usually given by basic properties of the laboratory physics .",
    "then , a `` good theory '' consistent with the actual physical process within the lab must obey the additional constraints given by the macroscopic observables . + in terms of effective complexity , the macroscopic observables respectively the additional information contributes to the regularities of @xmath0 and enlarges its effective complexity .",
    "[ def : effcompl ]    ' '' ''    given parameters @xmath104 , the _ effective complexity _ @xmath105 of a string @xmath0 constrained to a subset @xmath106 of all ensembles is @xmath107 or as @xmath98 if this set is empty .",
    "the set on the right - hand side is called the _ constrained minimization domain _ of @xmath0 for effective complexity and equals @xmath108 according to the notation of definition  [ def : effcompli ] .",
    "thus , @xmath109 .",
    "note that we allow that @xmath106 depends on @xmath0 .",

    "in general restricting the set of ensembles will increase the value of effective complexity , i.e. @xmath112 this is in agreement with our intuition .",
    "indeed such restrictions give a way to demand explicitly that some regularities of the considered string @xmath0 appear as a consequence of regularities of the generating process .",
    "as such , they contribute to the effective complexity .    if the constrained set @xmath106 or the constant @xmath113 are too small such that the ( constrained ) minimization domain @xmath114 is empty , then effective complexity is infinite , according to definition [ def : effcompl ] .",

    "the only modification is that the set @xmath337 has to be replaced by a set @xmath359",

    "originally , the kolmogorov structure function as well as kolmogorov minimal sufficient statistics were defined by using plain kolmogorov conditional complexity @xmath372 in ( [ def : entropy - of - suffstat ] ) and ( [ def : length - of - kolmminsuffstat * ] ) instead of chaitin s prefix version @xmath373 .",
    "it holds @xmath374 moreover , @xmath375 can equivalently be written as @xmath376 this formula looks very similar to the definition of ( unconstrained ) effective complexity , as given in definition  [ defeffectivecomplexity ] .",

    "we have given a formal definition of effective complexity and rigorous proofs of its basic properties .",
    "in particular , we have shown that there is an interesting relation between effective complexity and logical depth : the depth of a string @xmath0 is astronomically large if the effective complexity exceeds @xmath325 ; otherwise , it can be arbitrarily small .",
    "this statement is true up to a few technical conditions and up to certain additive constants .",
    "these constants become less and less important for longer and longer strings  this is comparable to the `` thermodynamic limit '' in statistical mechanics , and the behavior can be compared to that of a phase transition .",
    "so how useful is effective complexity for the study of natural systems ?",
    "we do not yet know the answer to this question , but we hope that our mathematically rigorous approach gives the first steps towards possible applications within mathematics or theoretical computer science .",
    "at least , we have shown that effective complexity has interesting properties , for example there are strings that have effective complexity close to their lengths .",
    "those strings are rare events only  `` most '' strings are in fact effectively simple ; this follows from theorem  [ thesimple ] .",
    "but this property is unavoidable : recall that a major motivation for the definition of effective complexity was that random strings should be simple ( in contrast to kolmogorov complexity ) . now",
    "since almost all strings are random , it follows that almost all strings must be effectively simple .",
    "most of our results concerning the constrained version of effective complexity @xmath105 were derived under the assumption that the dirac measure @xmath84 is an element of @xmath106 .",
    "although this is a natural assumption , the behavior of effective complexity might as well be completely different if it is dropped .",
    "investigating such situations in more detail could be useful in order to get better insight into the concept of effective complexity and its limitations .",
    "finally , a possible field of application of effective complexity might be statistical mechanics , where the notion of entropy and algorithmic complexity have both already led to interesting conclusions .",
    "after all , the constraints given by the set @xmath106 can be interpreted as macroscopic observables as discussed in section  [ seceffectivecomplexity ] , and we have already compared our result on logical depth with certain notions of statistical mechanics .",
    "as promised in the introduction , we give an explicit construction of a computable ensemble @xmath6 with the property that the entropy @xmath40 is finite but not computable :    [ exnonentropy ]    ' '' ''    for every @xmath36 , let @xmath395 be the set of strings that start with exactly @xmath396 zeroes , such that the @xmath54-th bit either does not exists or is a one . that is , @xmath397 and so on . clearly , this is a computable partition of @xmath2 into countably - infinite , mutually disjoint subsets : @xmath398 , @xmath399 if @xmath400 .",
    "we now construct an ensemble @xmath6 such that every set @xmath395 has weight @xmath38 , that is @xmath401 .",
    "we distribute the weight @xmath38 among the members of @xmath395 in a way , such that the resulting ensemble @xmath6 is computable , but has non - computable entropy .",
    "this is done as follows : let @xmath402 be a real number which is not computable , but enumerable from below .",
    "that is , there exists a computable sequence @xmath403 with @xmath404 which is increasing , i.e. @xmath405 , and which converges to @xmath406 , i.e. @xmath407 . for example , we may use chaitin s omega number@xcite @xmath408 where the sum is over all strings @xmath5 such that the universal prefix computer @xmath11 halts on input @xmath0 .",
    "the number @xmath406 gives the probability that the computer @xmath11 halts on randomly chosen input .",
    "it is a real number between zero and one , and it is obviously enumerable from below , but it is not computable .    given some weight @xmath409 $ ] and finitely many positive real numbers @xmath410 such that @xmath411 , the resulting entropy sum @xmath412 will always be larger than or equal to @xmath413 .",
    "the converse is also true : given some fixed entropy value @xmath414 , we can always find finitely many positive real numbers @xmath410 with @xmath411 such that @xmath415 .",
    "such a list of real numbers can be found in an obvious systematic way that can be implemented as a computer program .",
    "thus , to every @xmath36 , we may systematically distribute the weight @xmath38 to finitely many strings in @xmath416 such that the corresponding probabilities @xmath417 have entropy sum @xmath418 , i.e. @xmath419 the resulting ensemble is obviously computable , and the entropy is @xmath420 this is not a computable number .",
