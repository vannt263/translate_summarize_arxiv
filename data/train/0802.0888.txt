    "the cmb has not yet yielded all its secrets , particularly from its polarization .",
    "although the outlines of the power spectrum of the positive - parity @xmath2-modes have emerged since their first detection five years ago @xcite , its details have not , and the negative - parity @xmath3-modes remain entirely elusive .",
    "the principle sources of @xmath2-modes are the same perturbations in the primeval plasma that gave rise to temperature anisotropies .",
    "since the latter are well - measured , robust predictions exist for the cosmological @xmath10 spectrum on most angular scales .    to date",
    ", @xmath10 data from some seven collaborations are in agreement with predictions .",
    "nonetheless , more detailed characterization of the @xmath10 spectrum , one of the very few probes of the early universe , is important and may reveal surprises .",
    "additionally , these efforts lay groundwork for future detection of @xmath3-modes , which are compelling targets . at the subdegree angular scales studied by capmap",
    ", @xmath3-modes should arise from gravitational lensing of @xmath2-modes , and thus provide a new channel for examining the intervening energy content of the universe . at large angular scales",
    "their sole extragalactic sources are gravitational waves from the earliest instants of time ; detection of those primordial @xmath3-modes would give a measure of the energy scale of inflation itself .    here",
    "we report further measurements of the @xmath10 spectrum and new constraints on the @xmath3-mode power from the final season of capmap .",
    "these data derive from a unique combination of observing frequencies and angular resolution , and in particular extend to larger multipoles than previous work .",
    "capmap measured the cmb polarization at 40  ghz and 90  ghz simultaneously , two frequencies chosen to bracket the foreground frequency minimum observed by wmap and to permit new constraints on foreground contaminants . moreover , the measurements were made at very small angular scales using correlation polarimeters rather than bolometers or interferometers .",
    "thus , we report here data complementary to that from recent work ( including our own ) : @xcite .",
    "the reported power spectra , drawn from two complementary analysis pipelines , are robust , as evidenced by results from a suite of 72 null tests on the polarization maps , and from extensive simulations of possible systematic effects .",
    "we begin with description of the experimental configuration (  [ sec : instrument ] ) , the cmb observations (  [ sec : cmbobs ] ) , and the methods of calibration (  [ sec : calib ] ) , before moving on to explanation of the data analysis (  [ sec : analysis ] ) . ",
    "[ sec : results ] presents the polarization power spectra and the results of the null tests , while  [ sec : systematics ] and  [ sec : foregrounds ] discuss evaluation of systematic errors and foreground limits .",

    "capmap array configuration and the ring scan . the instantaneous locations of the 16 radiometers are shown with black ( gray ) circles for w - band ( q - band ) .",
    "the circle diameters show the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) beams .",
    "the telescope moved so that the center of the array continuously traced a constant - declination circle about the ncp .",
    "dashed circles indicate sky coverage : each is the path followed by one radiometer during a single 21  s cycle .",
    "each radiometer timestream is considered to be a function of the variable @xmath13.,width=325 ]    the capmap instrument is described in @xcite and summarized in @xcite .",
    "below we outline the final configuration used for the observations reported herein , highlighting improvements compared to the first season .",
    "the capmap instrument was optimized to measure the @xmath10 and @xmath7 power spectra , sacrificing sensitivity to @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "capmap comprised 16 heterodyne correlation polarimeters coupled via corrugated feed horns and high - density polyethylene lenses to the 7  m cassegrain antenna @xcite in crawford hill , nj ( w@xmath16 , n@xmath17 .",
    "12 receivers operated at w - band ( 84100  ghz ) with beam fwhm @xmath11 , while the other four operated at q - band ( 3546  ghz ) with beam fwhm @xmath12 .",
    "the receivers were organized into four groups ( numbered 0 to 3 ) , each including one q - band and three w - band receivers ( labeled b , c and d ) housed in a cryostat , which cooled the high - electron - mobility transistor low - noise amplifers ( lnas ) and feedhorns to 25  k , and the lenses to 80  k.    for each radiometer , the circular feed coupled two orthogonal components of the incident electric field via an orthomode transducer into lnas in each arm .",
    "the lnas , provided by jpl , were based on monolithic microwave integrated circuits ( mmics ) and had typical noise temperatures of 65  k for w - band and 35  k for q - band .",
    "after amplification and bandpass filtering , mixers downconverted the radio frequency signals to intermediate frequencies ( if ) in the range 218  ghz with local oscillators ( los ) operating at 82 ghz or 30.5 ghz . the lo signal for one arm of each polarimeter was phase - switched at 4  khz to suppress 1/@xmath18 noise .",
    "the three w - band radiometers in each cryostat shared a single lo .",
    "after if amplification , the w - band ( q - band ) signals were divided into three ( two ) frequency subbands per polarimeter , for a total of 44 channels . for each , signals from the two arms were combined in an analog multiplier and then preamplified before digitization .",
    "thus each polarimeter timestream was proportional to the product of the two orthogonal modes of the incoming electric field .",
    "at a given parallactic angle @xmath19 , each capmap polarimeter measured one linear combination of the stokes parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 + u \\sin \\bigl[2(\\psi + \\eta)\\bigr],\\ ] ] where the angle @xmath23 , the _ detector polarization angle _ , varied for each channel but was nominally @xmath24 .",
    "the subbands were labeled s0 , s1 and ( for w - band ) s2 .",
    "the two orthogonally - polarized total power signals were tapped off each arm of a polarimeter prior to the frequency subdivision , and recorded with detector diodes .",
    "because they were not phase - switched , these total power channels were too noisy to provide cmb data , but they were useful for assessing radiometer health , monitoring the atmospheric noise for data selection , measuring the properties of the beams , and determining the atmospheric opacity .    the active components ( the cold lnas , the warm los , the if amplifiers and the pre - amplifiers ) were temperature - controlled to stabilize the responses of the radiometers .",
    "these servo systems did not perform consistently , however . in particular , their temperature set - points had to be increased multiple times , resulting in changes of 1020  k from the start to the end of the observing season .",
    "moreover , the temperatures occasionally drifted for 510 hour stretches in response to large swings in the ambient temperature .",
    "these drifts were typically at the level of 0.3 k  hr@xmath25 but reached as high as 12 k  hr@xmath25 in some cases . as described in ",
    "[ sec : systematics ] , these temperature instabilities led to a systematic error in the experiment , but it was considerably smaller than the statistical error .",
    "both the polarization and total power channels were sampled at 100 khz by a commercial sigma - delta adc board , as described in @xcite . in lieu of recording high - speed data as in the first observing season of capmap",
    ", the polarization channels were digitally demodulated both in phase and @xmath26 out of phase with the 4  khz phase switch clock .",
    "the out - of - phase ( quadrature ) data lacked signal from the sky , but had the same white noise properties as the in - phase data and so were used for systematic checks .",
    "a small amount of signal ( typically @xmath27 ) did leak into the quadrature data , due to phase shifts in the data relative to the digitized clock used for demodulation , but this led to a negligible sensitivity reduction for the in - phase data .",
    "the data rate was 2.9  gb per day .     parallactic angle coverage .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines show the paths of the 12 w - band ( 4 q - band ) radiometers during a single 21  s cycle .",
    "pixels at each declination were observed at a variety of parallactic angles , overconstraining the @xmath20 and @xmath21 stokes parameters everywhere in the map.,width=325 ]    the array configuration and scan strategy , illustrated in figure  [ fig : scan ] , were designed to have high symmetry , provide highly cross - linked maps , and constrain @xmath20 and @xmath21 tightly with uniform parallactic angle coverage . for cmb observations ,",
    "the telescope s optical axis described a circle around the north celestial pole ( ncp ) with a radius @xmath28 and a period of 21  s. the observed position is parameterized by the ring variable @xmath13 shown in figure  [ fig : scan ] .",
    "this scanning method surveyed a @xmath29 disc centered on the ncp , covering the entire region every six hours with good noise uniformity ( @xmath30 ) and an even parallactic angle distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coverage ] ) .",
    "the 7  m antenna provided a large and uniform focal plane so that even the outermost receivers had essentially gaussian main beam profiles .",
    "the fact that the elevation varied continuously throughout the scan provided several side benefits .",
    "the ring motion produced a @xmath31 modulation in the total power channels with amplitude given by @xcite @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the opacity of the atmosphere , @xmath34 is its temperature , @xmath35 is the central elevation of the ring scan , and @xmath36 its radius . the total power channels thus continuously monitored the opacity and the stability of the atmosphere . since the atmospheric signal is an unpolarized intensity @xmath37 ,",
    "sinusoidal responses in the polarimetry channels measured the small leakage of @xmath37 into polarization , which we refer to as @xmath38 leakage . as discussed further in  [ sec : data_selection ] and  [ sec : mapmaking ] , the atmospheric signal can be cleanly removed from the polarization channels ( with a 15% loss of sensitivity ) .",
    "we note here the significant improvements in the final instrument configuration for capmap since the first season ( reported in @xcite ) .",
    "the original four w - band receivers have been supplemented by an additional eight w - band and four q - band receivers .",
    "data were collected with the ring scan strategy described above , rather than with a constant - elevation scan .",
    "the lenses were upgraded to reduce @xmath39 leakage , primarily by improving their anti - reflection ( ar ) coating .",
    "the original coatings comprised birefringent grooves , which were replaced with a polarization - symmetric square grid of round holes ; the resulting improvement is reported in  [ sec : iqleak ] . finally , an order - of - magnitude reduction of scan synchronous signals from telescope sidelobes was accomplished in a four - pronged approach @xcite : 1 ) a co - moving ground screen was added between the receivers and the secondary mirror ; 2 ) a baffle was added covering the edges of the secondary mirror , redirecting rays otherwise headed for the ground back onto the primary and thence to the sky ; 3 ) gaps between panels of the primary mirror were sealed with copper tape , measurably reducing diffractive sidelobes from those gaps ; and 4 ) several nearby trees that had previously illuminated sidelobes were removed .",
    "these modifications reduced the linear dependence of the polarimeter response on azimuth by an order of magnitude , from 500  @xmath8k  deg@xmath25 to 50  @xmath8k  deg@xmath25 . moreover , whereas these slopes showed variations of @xmath40  @xmath8k  deg@xmath25  day@xmath25 during the first season , any remaining variations were no longer measurable . concluding remarks on the efficacy of this sidelobe - reduction effort are given in  [ sec : data_selection ] and  [ sec : results ] .",
    "between 13 december 2004 and 28 april 2005 , capmap recorded 1658 hours of cmb data : a 53% livetime .",
    "another 3% of the time was devoted to calibration data .",
    "the majority of the downtime was due to snow , rain , and heavy clouds , but power outages , telescope repair , and other gross failures prevented observations about 10% of the time .",
    "we downselected the cmb data as described in ",
    "[ sec : data_selection ] , primarily removing more periods of bad weather . the final sample comprised data from 29% of the time in the interval above .",
    "we divided the data into three periods ( i , ii , and iii ) of roughly equal length and sensitivity , separated by power outages .",
    "these periods are visible in figures  [ fig : tau ]  and  [ fig : gains ] . for the purposes of data",
    "selection and quality inspection , we further subdivided the data into nine subperiods .",
    "we also designated one long continuous segment of one of the subperiods as the reference period ( rp ) , used for initial exploration of the data .",
    "in addition to cmb data , calibration data were taken before , during , and after the season . these data measured parameters necessary for translating the cmb timestreams into polarization power spectra , including the coefficients in the pointing model , the beam sizes and shapes , the detector polarization angles , and the calibration coefficients @xmath41 relating the detector voltage outputs to thermal cmb fluctuations .",
    "these last require measurement of both the atmospheric opacity @xmath33 and the detector responsivities @xmath42 ( with units v  k@xmath25 ) to thermal sources below the atmosphere : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the elevation of the observation .",
    "we refer to the denominator in equation   as the _ absorption correction_. the primary calibration method for @xmath45 required evaluation of telescope beam efficiencies .",
    "we also used the calibration measurements to determine the level of @xmath38 leakage .",
    "below we describe the measurements of all these quantities .",
    "we conclude with a description of the detector responsivity measurements , and the model used to extrapolate those measurements to all times during the observing season .",
    "the impact of uncertainties in determining all these parameters is assessed in  [ sec : systematics ] .      to determine where the receivers were pointed during cmb and calibration observations , we undertook measurements of both the global pointing of the array center , and the relative offsets of each radiometer from a fixed position in the focal plane .",
    "the global pointing relied on a 10-parameter pointing model @xcite , constrained by two sets of radio data : one obtained on 31 dec 2003 with 154 source observations , and another over 2627 nov 2004 with 50 observations . in each session , a single q - band receiver was repeatedly rastered over a succession of five sources ( cas  a , cyg  a , tau  a , omc  1 , and jupiter ) as the sky rotated .",
    "each source map was fit to a gaussian beam shape , and the recovered center in telescope coordinates was compared to the known source position .",
    "the resulting pointing offsets were used to fit the pointing model parameters .",
    "the residuals from the best fit had an rms of @xmath46 in elevation and @xmath47 in cross - elevation .",
    "the results from both data sets were statistically consistent , showing the pointing solution to be stable in time .",
    "the relative offsets of the radiometers were determined from 11 observations on 2627 nov 2004 , in which the full array was rastered across jupiter .",
    "again , source maps were fit to gaussian beams .",
    "the measured offsets agreed well with optical simulations , to within the known alignment tolerances .",
    "the uncertainties in the offsets were typically @xmath48 and always smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "the beam size and shape for each radiometer were measured with observations of jupiter in the total power channels .",
    "two scan strategies were used , both optimized for efficiency by concentrating integration time on single receivers . the first strategy consisted of a tight raster scan with a @xmath50 width and a @xmath51 elevation step . the second , a _ point and",
    "integrate _ scan , used discrete steps spaced on a @xmath52 grid with a 2  s integration time at each point , bracketed in time by 2  s off - source measurements .",
    "for both scan types , the resulting maps were fit to two - dimensional gaussians to extract the beam parameters .",
    "the two scan strategies produced consistent estimates of the mean beam fwhm in each frequency channel : @xmath11 and @xmath12 for w- and q - band respectively . the standard deviation of the beam size measurements of all w - band ( q - band ) radiometers was 2% ( 3% ) ; all were within @xmath53 of the mean in each case .",
    "we note that the 2q beam  the highest in the focal plane  was slightly truncated as it left the vertex cab , which elongated it and increased its beam size by about 6% compared to those from the other three q radiometers .    since the center frequencies of the polarimeter subbands differed from those of the broadband total power channels , and since the optics were near diffraction - limited , the beam sizes of the high and low subbands differed by about @xmath54 from the measured total power values @xcite .",
    "the beams were all quite close to circular , with elongations less than 8% .",
    "elongation is defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the beam radii along the principal axes .",
    "jupiter measurements also constrained the @xmath38 leakage parameters of each receiver ; the point and integrate scan was optimized specifically for this purpose .",
    "since the @xmath58 noise of the polarization channels was negligible over the four seconds per point in the map , it was possible to integrate down to measure the very small polarized signals due to optical and radiometric @xmath38 .",
    "these measurements showed that the monopole , dipole , and quadrupole terms ( see @xcite or @xcite for the definitions ) were below @xmath59 db , @xmath60 db , and @xmath61 db respectively .",
    "these levels are small enough to neglect , as discussed in  [ sec : systematics ] .",
    "the new lens ar coatings described in  [ sec : instrument ] improved the quadrupole suppression by a factor of ten compared to the original grooved coatings used during capmap s first season .",
    "the monopole leakage terms were also measured by comparing each polarimeter s response to the atmospheric @xmath31 variation in the cmb ring scan to the response from the total power channels , as mentioned in  [ sec : instrument ] .",
    "these measurements were consistent with those from jupiter .",
    "polarized map of the moon from channel 2bs0 .",
    "the dashed contours indicate negative signal levels .",
    "the polarization angle for this channel was fitted to be @xmath62 .",
    "the moon was not full , as can be seen by the envelope on the quadrupole pattern , which features deeper lobes on the left side ; this effect was taken into account when determining the detector polarization angles.,width=230 ]    observations of the moon were used to determine the detector polarization angles @xmath23 .",
    "thermal radiation from the moon is polarized according to its propagation direction relative to the normal to the surface ( see  [ sec : gains ] for a related discussion ) .",
    "thus , the polarization pattern of the moon is oriented radially and peaks in amplitude near the edge of the moon s disc .",
    "projected onto the sensitivity axes of a capmap polarimeter , the radial pattern was seen as a quadrupole , which we fitted to find the angle @xmath23 as illustrated in figure  [ fig : moon ] .",
    "the measurement error on @xmath23 ranged from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ; the resulting systematic uncertainty in the final power spectra was small , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : systematics ] .",
    "these measurements of @xmath23 also revealed that one radiometer was installed nearly @xmath65 rotated from its design orientation , which was confirmed during decommissioning .",
    "this affected the parallactic angle coverage but was taken into account in the analysis .",
    "observations of tau a at multiple parallactic angles were also fitted for @xmath23 and gave consistent results .",
    "the ring scan permitted continuous monitoring of the opacity during cmb observations .",
    "ten times during the season , the opacity was independently measured from jupiter scans followed by sky dips , in which the telescope was scanned in elevation from the zenith to near the horizon and back . the combination of the jupiter and sky dip data were analyzed to yield both total power responsivity estimates and opacity estimates .",
    "these opacity measurements confirmed the continuous monitoring results , as shown in figure  [ fig : tau ] .",
    "the clear sky brightness temperature data from the geostationary operational environmental satellite were used to estimate @xmath34 , which varied from 255295  k over the course of the season .",
    "the amplitude @xmath66 ( eq .  ) was averaged each hour across the 7 ( 6 ) most stable w - band ( q - band ) total power channels .",
    "numerical evaluation of equation   resulted in the hourly estimates of @xmath33 plotted in figure  [ fig : tau ] , which were splined to the 21  s intervals on which the calibration was applied .",
    "the average value for @xmath33 after data selection was 0.135 ( 0.092 ) for w - band ( q - band ) , corresponding to an absorption correction of 1.23 ( 1.15 ) .",
    "measurements of @xmath33 were limited to 10% accuracy by uncertainties in the total power responsivities used to convert @xmath66 to temperature units . the resulting uncertainty in the absorption correction depended on @xmath33 , but was in the worst case 5% ( 2% ) for w - band ( q - band ) .",
    "the season average was a 1.7% ( 1.6% ) uncertainty in the absolute calibration for w - band ( q - band ) ; the impact of this uncertainty is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : systematics ] .    these @xmath33 measurements agreed with the jupiter plus sky dip measurements at the 5% ( 7% ) rms level for w - band ( q - band ) , consistent with errors in the latter .      as in the capmap first season",
    ", the primary measurement of the responsivity @xmath67 in v  k@xmath25 for each polarimeter was made using a nutating aluminum flat ( the chopper plate ) installed in front of the secondary mirror @xcite .",
    "when radiation from the sky is reflected obliquely by the plate , the non - zero resistivity of aluminum leads to different reflection coefficients for the transverse electric and transverse magnetic boundary conditions , producing a polarized signal from initially unpolarized radiation .",
    "the same effect also causes the thermal radiation emitted from the plate to be polarized ; the net signal incident on a polarimeter is given in temperature units by @xmath684\\sqrt{\\pi\\epsilon_0\\rho\\nu}\\,y(t_{\\text{sky}}-t_{\\text{plate}})\\alpha,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the nutation angle of the plate , @xmath70 is the central ( band - averaged ) frequency , @xmath71 is the resistivity of the plate , @xmath72 is a geometrical factor of order unity , @xmath73 is the temperature of the aluminum , and @xmath74 is the sum of the atmospheric temperature and the cmb temperature , @xmath75 .",
    "the quantity in brackets involving @xmath76 is the _ thermodynamic correction _ , which puts the responsivity into temperature units appropriate for fluctuations in a blackbody source at @xmath75 .",
    "the full nutation range is @xmath77 , producing a modulated signal with peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath78 approximately 90  mk for typical sky and plate temperatures .",
    "the responsivity is found from @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the beam efficiency @xcite , described in the following paragraphs , and @xmath81 is the measured amplitude from the polarimeter in volts .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath78 is @xmath82 , dominated by a 5% uncertainty on the value of @xmath83 , and @xmath84 uncertainties on each of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    because the chopper plate intercepted the beam before the primary and secondary mirrors , each responsivity measurement from it had to be corrected to account for the telescope beam efficiency @xmath80 .",
    "a random surface error rms of @xmath87 decreases the responsivity to a beam - filling thermal source by the ruze factor @xcite at the wavelength @xmath88 : @xmath89.\\ ] ] we estimated @xmath80 and an associated uncertainty for each frequency channel using simulations constrained by measurements .",
    "the measurements included observations of the moon with the capmap receivers , and original surface measurements from @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite reported the range of measured rms on the individual panels of the primary mirror before installation ( @xmath90 ) and the existence of a 150200  @xmath8 m step ( @xmath91 ) between the top and bottom halves of the mirror .",
    "furthermore , they measured @xmath80 at 100  ghz with a prime - focus feed system and inferred @xmath92 m with a @xmath93 error of 30  @xmath8 m .",
    "the secondary mirror surface errors were negligible .",
    "the simulations treated the phase error on a @xmath94 grid covering the telescope aperture .",
    "each simulation drew @xmath90 for each panel from a gaussian distribution @xmath95 m , and @xmath91 from @xmath96 m .",
    "moreover , each panel was considered to have an additional fourth - order polynomial distortion , consistent with its having an adjuster in each corner ; these distortions were constrained by the requirement that the overall surface rms for all the gridded points be drawn from a flat distribution between 70130  @xmath8 m . in  [ sec : systematics ] we describe a method , using the sidelobes from these simulations , to estimate the systematic effect from ignoring them in the analysis .",
    "the simulations produced beam patterns consistent with the 100-ghz one plotted in @xcite when the appropriate feed pattern was used ; that feed resulted in a 3  db illumination contour that encompassed the central eight of the 27 panels on the mirror .",
    "by contrast , the capmap w - band receivers each illuminated approximately two panels at that level . for each w - band receiver",
    ", many realizations of the simulated beam patterns were each convolved with a @xmath97 thermal source and compared to the moon data , which comprised measurements of the total power response out to @xmath63 from the moon center .",
    "good qualitative agreement was obtained , but only for simulations which conformed to the requirement that @xmath87 was contained in @xmath98~\\mu$]m . from consideration of simulations of all the w - band receivers , we estimated @xmath99 .",
    "we note that this estimate is in good agreement with the value @xmath100 obtained from inserting @xmath101 m into equation  .    for q - band ,",
    "similar simulations were made but studied in less detail since the final estimated beam efficiency was near unity : @xmath102 .",
    "the final absolute calibration errors from combining the @xmath78 and @xmath80 uncertainties in quadrature were 9.4% ( 7.6% ) for w - band ( q - band ) .",
    "the responsivity for each of the 44 polarization channels was determined from chopper plate observations at 10 separate times , spaced approximately evenly throughout the observing season . in each of the 10 measurements ,",
    "the chopper plate was run for approximately 30 min and the amplitude was fit in 6  s intervals containing @xmath103 nutation periods each , determining the responsivities with better than @xmath104 statistical precision .",
    "the responsivity of each channel was also measured through 67 observations of the polarized source tau  a during and after the season .",
    "the absolute accuracy of these measurements was limited to 25% ( 14% ) in w - band ( q - band ) by the uncertainty in the polarized flux from tau a , measured most accurately by wmap @xcite .",
    "the tau a measurements were noisier than the chopper plate results and were made at different times , but they did confirm the long timescale features discussed in  [",
    "sec : gains ] .        as described in ",
    "[ sec : beams ] , the beam from radiometer 2q was slightly truncated by the receiver cabin window , and so did not illuminate the chopper plate uniformly , which led to overestimation of the 2q responsivities ( since @xmath72 in equation   was decreased by an unknown amount ) .",
    "in fact , the 2q responsivities inferred from the chopper plate measurements implied a much better sensitivity than measurements of the lna noise temperatures allowed .",
    "thus , the responsivities for 2qs0 and 2qs1 were adjusted to match the tau a measurements .",
    "since the temperatures of the active polarimeter components were known to have varied throughout the observing season , additional chopper plate observations were undertaken at the end of the season to measure the linear variation of the responsivity of each polarimetry channel to each of the three germane servoed temperatures described in ",
    "[ sec : instrument ] . in each case , the responsivity decreased with increasing temperature .",
    "the temperature coefficients varied for different channels but were typically 1  % /k for the lna and if amplifier temperatures and 0.5  % /k for the lo temperatures .      the chopper plate measurements revealed that the detector responsivities were not constant with time , with typical channels varying by @xmath105 relative to their initial values , and the worst channels varying by as much as @xmath106 .",
    "we describe here the time - dependent detector responsivity model used for calibration of the capmap timestreams .    figure  [ fig : gains ] shows the 10 chopper plate measurements for two representative channels . since the temperatures of the active polarimeter components were seen to increase throughout the season , the approximately steady decrease of the responsivities with time was not unexpected .",
    "in fact , considering the effects of all the temperature coefficients led to a typical prediction of a 20% change across the full season , in good agreement with observations for most ( @xmath107 ) channels .",
    "however , complete recovery of the responsivity variations on shorter timescales was prevented both by occasional periods of grounding problems in the readout thermometry , and by phase lags due to the poor placement of some thermometers relative to the active components .",
    "the panel on the right in figure  [ fig : gains ] demonstrates an anomalous shift in the measured responsivity during period ii .",
    "such shifts affected about a quarter of the channels at the 10% level or greater and were not forecast .",
    "we suspect the shifts , for which the worst case was 80% , were related to the power outages at the boundaries of period ii .",
    "the sensitivity of each affected radiometer in mk@xmath108 did not vary measurably across the periods  the shift was only a change in the v  k@xmath25 responsivity .",
    "finally , one radiometer , 1d , showed a season - long responsivity decrease in all three of its subbands three times larger than predicted from its temperature coefficients measured at the end of the season .",
    "the radiometer otherwise performed normally ; this decrease was also only a change in the v  k@xmath25 responsivity .    to properly track the time dependence of the responsivities of the channels throughout the run ( and to gauge our uncertainties in the understanding of said time dependence ) , we evaluated two different models for fitting the 10 chopper plate measurements and interpolating to each 21  s ring cycle .    for each channel , model",
    "1 s fit used the three measured temperature coefficients ( @xmath109 ) and known housekeeping temperatures ( @xmath110 ) to constrain two parameters@xmath111 , an overall constant , and @xmath112 , a possible offset for period ii only : @xmath113    model 2 , now with three parameters per channel , replaced the last term in equation   with a simple linear term : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a single negative slope ( again different for each channel ) , characterizing the overall responsivity decrease with time , and @xmath41 and @xmath116 are constants analogous to @xmath111 and @xmath112 in model 1 .",
    "both models were similar in that they accounted for the period ii anomaly and for the gradual decrease of the responsivity throughout the observing season .",
    "because model 1 applied the temperature coefficients to each ring cycle , it also addressed shorter - timescale changes in the responsivities .",
    "however , as mentioned above , use of the temperature coefficients did not faithfully reproduce those changes in all instances .",
    "for this reason , we used the simplified model 2 , illustrated for two channels in figure  [ fig : gains ] , as our baseline model .",
    "the model accounted for the main features of the responsivity variations , with an rms of 6.5% for the 440 residuals from 44 channels and 10 chopper plate measurements .",
    "the systematic implications of its uncertainties are discussed in  [ sec : systematics ] .",
    "this section describes the steps in the data analysis culminating in polarization power spectra .",
    "we discuss first how the data were selected for processing , then their reduction into maps , and the subsequent estimation of power spectra .",
    "two separate analysis pipelines ( arbitrarily named 1 and 2 ) were developed ; at each step we discuss the approach of each . throughout the analysis , we relied on simulations and consistency checks to evaluate data quality , immunity to systematic effects , and internal consistency of the pipelines .",
    "we conclude the section with descriptions of the simulation tools and the null test methodology .      since capmap collected data from near sea level in the garden state , it was critical to cull data contaminated by large spatial and temporal fluctuations in the atmosphere during poor weather . in this subsection",
    ", we describe all cuts made on the data and conclude with some observations about properties of the final data set .",
    "we list here several preliminary cuts , indicating parenthetically the fraction of the 1658 hours of cmb data discarded by each .",
    "data selection began by dividing the raw timestreams from each channel into 21 s ring scan cycles .",
    "only complete cycles were selected for inclusion in the final data set .",
    "cycles exhibiting irregular telescope motion were discarded ( 3.8% ) , as were those during periods when the cryostats were warm or thermally unstable ( 6.9% ) , or when known electrical or receiver malfunctions existed ( 2.4% ) . only for the q - band receivers , the sun passing through narrow , constant far sidelobes at specific times appeared as a several - mk signal in the polarimeters ; cycles were cut according to the solar position ( 7.1% of the q - band data only ) .",
    "the remaining selection criteria were all derived from the receiver data , and were initially developed independently for the two pipelines .",
    "each used different estimators of the data quality . in cutting , pipeline 1",
    "rejected all polarimeters from individual cycles , while pipeline 2 made cuts on contiguous sets of 11 cycles and allowed for channel - specific cuts . in the end , both pipelines converged to a common technique described below : pipeline 1 s quality estimator applied on both timescales , with channel - specific cuts where appropriate . in distinguishing among differing techniques ,",
    "we were guided by the results from the null test suite described in ",
    "[ sec : null_tests ] and  [ sec : results ] , not by the power spectra of the cmb maps .",
    "to further characterize each cycle , for each total power ( tp ) or polarimetry channel we averaged the data into @xmath117 angular bins and fitted to the following five - parameter model : @xmath118 for data selection , we used @xmath119 .",
    "( in subsequent analysis steps , the data were binned into 200 or more angular bins , depending on the pipeline . )",
    "the first two terms in this fourier mode expansion dominated the response of every channel : @xmath120 describes the tp system temperature ( or the polarimeter offset ) , and @xmath66 the channel s first - order response to elevation changes , and thus to @xmath34 as in equation  .",
    "their values for tp channels were typically 100  k and 500  mk respectively ; for the polarization channels they were @xmath121  mk and @xmath122  mk , governed by the size of the @xmath39 leakage . for a single cycle ,",
    "the remaining three terms were typically consistent with zero .",
    "of these , @xmath123 and @xmath124 characterize an azimuthal dependence , while @xmath125 is the second - order term in the elevation dependence .",
    "all subsequent cuts were based on these fits for each cycle , most often on their @xmath126 goodness - of - fit statistics .",
    "the primary cut variable used to reject bad weather was obtained from @xmath126 values from a subset of the tp channels , comprising the nine w - band channels with the lowest @xmath58 noise , constrained so that at least one such channel was in every cryostat .",
    "( since all tp channels had @xmath58 noise in excess of white noise , their mean @xmath126 values were all in excess of 13 , the number of degrees of freedom . ) for each subperiod , the nine @xmath126 distributions were renormalized to have their peaks at the same values , and then the renormalized @xmath126 statistics were averaged to provide the cut variable for each cycle , a variable we call the tp-@xmath126 . atmospheric contamination in the q- and w - band tp channels",

    "[ fig : tp_weathercutstat ] . the distribution drawn in red was obtained from the entire rp distribution after applying just the 11-cycle cut ( see text ) ; it approximates the best - weather distribution .",

    "was studied with many combinations of parameters defining the single - cycle cut and the longer timescale cuts .",
    "the chosen parameter set was : any 11 cycles were removed if at least seven of them had a tp-@xmath126 @xmath127 ; and any single cycle was cut if its tp-@xmath126 exceeded 2 .",
    "these cuts were applied uniformly to all polarimetry channels , discarding 19.4% of the full data set .",
    "the five - ring - mode fits to the polarization channels were also used for the final cuts on the data . for any candidate cycle ,",
    "the sum of the @xmath126 values for all functioning w - band ( and , separately , q - band ) polarimeters was formed , and if either of these sums was @xmath128 high , that cycle was cut for _ all _ polarimeters .",
    "similar cuts were made on the maximum residual to the five - parameter fit for all functioning w - band ( and separately q - band ) polarimeters in a given cycle .",
    "for these two cuts , the idea was to use the overall goodness of fit for the ensemble of polarimeters in a given cycle to keep either all or none of them .",
    "a further 1.6% of the data was so removed .",
    "the next cut was based upon the fact that the noise of a properly functioning polarimetry channel should depend linearly on the total power level .",
    "this relationship was examined for each polarimeter , for each of the nine subperiods .",
    "the linear relationships were dominant , but for some isolated periods , cycles were found to deviate significantly from the expected behavior . as these deviations indicated receiver malfunctioning ,",
    "those cycles were discarded ( 3.5% ) .",
    "a final cut was invoked to remove glitches by eliminating cycles for individual polarimeters with a residual deviant at more than 3@xmath129 , removing 1.7% of the q - band and 0.3% of the w - band data .",
    "we close this subsection with some observations about the data quality of the polarimeters derived from examination of their five - ring - mode fits . in particular , we define two measures that were not used in data selection but were used to classify data in the null test suite (  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the tp channels , the @xmath126 distributions from the fits to most polarimeter channels did closely follow the expected @xmath126 distribution for 13 degrees of freedom , verifying at the same time our noise model ( white noise ) and that five parameters described the data well .",
    "one such channel s distribution is shown in the top panel on the left in figure  [ fig:5m_csq ] .",
    "a few channels , however  including the one depicted on the right in figure  [ fig:5m_csq]exhibited @xmath126 distributions shifted slightly high .",
    "given the large number of cycles entering these distributions , even a @xmath126 shift of less than 1.0 was significant at more than 10 standard deviations .",
    "it was found , not surprisingly , that such channels were the ones that showed the worst ( highest ) @xmath58 knees ; and that such channels were the same in every one of the 9 subperiods . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig:5m_csq ] shows a noise spectrum for each of the two channels in the lower panels .",
    "we defined a polarimeter s _ grand @xmath126 _ as the mean value of its @xmath126 distribution ; we tested for contamination associated with high grand @xmath126 in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we also simulated the effects of @xmath58 noise directly , as described in ",
    "[ sec : systematics ] .    for each polarimeter channel , and again for each subperiod",
    ", we constructed the 18-element _ ground - synchronous structure _ vector from an appropriate average of the residuals in each @xmath13 bin of the ring scan .",
    "we evaluated the @xmath126 for the model of zero ground - synchronous structure for each polarimeter ; the w - band channels were consistent with no such signal , but two of the eight q - band channels were not .",
    "those two channels showed no evidence , however , for time - variability in their ground - synchronous structure .",
    "scan - synchronous pickup from telescope sidelobes would be manifest as nonzero ground - synchronous structure , so these results are further evidence that the telescope sidelobe reduction efforts (  [ sec : instrument ] ) were largely successful . nonetheless , as described in ",
    "[ sec : mapmaking ] , the ground - synchronous structure mode was projected out of the data before power spectrum analysis .",
    "the timestream of a given capmap channel can be decomposed into signal plus noise as follows : @xmath130 here , @xmath131  denotes the timestream values , represented as a vector of length @xmath132 .",
    "the celestial signal in the map space is represented as a vector @xmath133  with @xmath134 components @xmath135 , where the index @xmath136 denotes a combination of a pixel and a choice of stokes parameter .",
    "the @xmath137 pointing matrix is denoted @xmath138 . the coordinate system in which @xmath133  is defined and",
    "the corresponding form of the pointing matrix were different for the two pipelines , as discussed below .",
    "the objective of mapmaking is to invert equation   statistically , arriving at an estimator @xmath139 for the cmb signal @xmath133 , with associated noise covariance matrix @xmath140 .",
    "the estimated signal @xmath139 is called a _",
    "map vector_. it is well known that there is an optimal choice of unbiased estimator ( e.g. , @xcite ) , defined by the pair of equations @xmath141 assuming that the detector noise @xmath142  can be modeled as gaussian with covariance matrix @xmath143 .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath41 needed in equation   was derived from a noise model that assumed white noise .",
    "then , certain modes in the data that were to be marginalized in the mapmaking were assigned large variance as follows : @xmath144 where @xmath145 was diagonal , @xmath146 was a small regulating constant , and each row of the matrices @xmath147 contained one timestream mode to be projected out .",
    "the assumption that @xmath145 was diagonal  that is , that the receiver noise was uncorrelated at different times  was verified by data quality studies .",
    "the white noise level used in @xmath145 was independently estimated in each cycle to allow for time dependence .",
    "the noise estimation method was tested extensively in simulations and found to reconstruct the true white noise level with acceptable accuracy .",
    "the matrix @xmath148 contained ring modes : the lowest five fourier modes in the ring variable @xmath13 in each cycle .",
    "the matrix @xmath149 contained ground - synchronous structure modes : one mode for each of @xmath117 bins around the ring scan .    assigning a large variance to the ring and",
    "ground - synchronous modes was merely a device for projecting them out when making @xmath150-weighted maps ( eq .  ) .",
    "those modes would be removed completely in the limit @xmath151 .",
    "it was preferable to keep the noise matrix invertible , however , by assigning a small nonzero value to @xmath146 , chosen to be large enough to avoid numerical difficulties but still insignificant compared to typical elements of @xmath41 .",
    "we verified that changing this parameter over three orders of magnitude did not affect the results of either pipeline .",
    "ring mode removal was necessary to project out the contaminating atmosphere signal from @xmath39 leakage , but it also served to highpass filter the timestream , so that the remaining noise could be treated as white .",
    "the mode removal led to an increase of the statistical error on the final result in the full range @xmath152 by 15% .",
    "most @xmath5 bands were affected only by 510% , but the sensitivity of the lowest band , @xmath153 , was reduced by 70% , and the sensitivity for @xmath154 was essentially eliminated .    the noise was verified to be uncorrelated between different channels , including different subbands of each polarimeter , and consequently we estimated a net data vector @xmath139  for a given subset of w- or q - band channels by summing the individual noise - weighted maps ( eq .  ) and adding the inverse noise covariance matrices .",
    "we also combined w- and q - band channels in an enlarged pixel space ( _ q@xmath155w analysis _ ) as described in  [ sec : ps ] .    in pipeline 1 ,",
    "the pixel space was a standard pixelization in declination and right ascension ( ra ) , using healpix with @xmath156 .",
    "at this resolution there were @xmath157 pixels in our field , each of diameter @xmath158 or roughly one - half the w - band beam fwhm .",
    "mapmaking by brute force application of equation   would require @xmath159 matrix operations and therefore be prohibitively expensive .",
    "however , we found a mathematically equivalent algorithm @xcite , based on repeated application of the sherman - woodbury formula @xcite , that was computationally efficient .    in pipeline 2 ,",
    "the underlying pixel space was an azimuthal pixelization about the ncp as described by @xcite , with @xmath160 bins in declination ( @xmath161 ) and @xmath162 bins in ra .",
    "then , the largest pixels were at the outer edge of the survey region , with diameter @xmath163 or one - third of the w - band beam . however , estimation of @xmath139 was obtained in the half - fourier space ( @xmath161 , @xmath164 ) , where here and below the symbol @xmath165 represents the fourier transform variable for a coordinate @xmath166 .",
    "prior to construction of the pointing matrix @xmath138 , the timestream data from each polarimetry channel were binned into ( @xmath13 , lst ) coordinates .",
    "data at fixed @xmath13 were fourier transformed in lst , resulting in a _ receiver map _ in ( @xmath167 ) , used as @xmath168 in equation  .",
    "each @xmath13 corresponded to a fixed declination , hour angle , and parallactic angle , so @xmath164 only differed from @xmath169 by a fixed phase for each @xmath13 , and @xmath138 was straightforward to compute .",
    "ring mode removal was performed as in pipeline 1 , using equation  , though without the term @xmath170 .",
    "ground - synchronous structure corresponds to an lst - independent signal , which was removed in these coordinates by discarding the dc mode @xmath171 .",
    "the use of the fourier transform greatly accelerated the mapmaking process , with evaluation scaling as @xmath172 rather than @xmath173 .",
    "this acceleration came about because in this basis the noise covariance matrix was block diagonal  it did not connect pixels with different values of @xmath174in the limit that the noise in each channel and each @xmath13 bin was independent of lst .",
    "in fact the noise was only lst - invariant at the @xmath175 level , but extensive simulations showed that the approximation of invariant noise resulted in a negligible systematic error , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : systematics ] .",
    "the half - fourier coordinate system also diagonalized the theory covariance matrix , yielding a similar speed increase for the power spectrum analysis .",
    "the power spectrum estimation thus broke down into @xmath176 separate subproblems , one for each unique value of @xmath174 .",
    "further acceleration by a factor of three was obtained by discarding fourier modes with @xmath177 , which only probe angular scales beyond @xmath178 .",

    "results for the parameters @xmath183 are reported in  [ sec : results ] for several different choices of the number of bands @xmath184 and the trial power spectra .    to estimate the overall sensitivity and to evaluate the agreement of the data with the concordance model for @xmath10 defined in @xcite and evaluated using camb",
    ", we performed two - band fits with one @xmath10 and one @xmath7 band in the range @xmath187 $ ] .",
    "for these , the @xmath10 parameter was a dimensionless multiplier to the concordance model , while the @xmath7 parameter was a flat bandpower in @xmath8k@xmath9 . for evaluating null maps ( see  [ sec : null_tests ] and  [ sec : results ] ) , we made similar two - band fits , but with both the @xmath10 and @xmath7 parameters taken as flat bandpowers .",
    "to estimate spectral features for the final analysis , we formed seven bins in @xmath5 with width @xmath188 , except we expanded the lowest bin ( @xmath153 ) to account for mode removal , and we extended the highest bin out to @xmath178 to provide a check for unexpected power ( perhaps from point sources ) on small angular scales .",
    "the choice @xmath188 resulted in small correlations between adjacent bandpowers ( typically 5% , and 20% for the worst case ) ; the correlations rose sharply for narrower bins because of mode - coupling from the finite size of the survey region .",
    "we estimated @xmath10 and @xmath7 for each bin as flat bandpowers , resulting in 14 bands in total .",
    "for the q@xmath155w analysis , the pixel space was expanded by a factor of two , so that each map pixel appeared once for each of the two different beam sizes .",
    "the noise was taken , as usual , to be uncorrelated among all polarimetry channels , but the theory matrix was constrained to represent the same underlying cmb sky at both frequencies ( properly accounting for the beam window function for cross - correlating two beams with gaussian widths @xmath189 : @xmath190 $ ] ) .    from the @xmath184-dimensional joint likelihood function @xmath191 , we calculated the @xmath184 one - dimensional marginalized functions @xmath192 , from which all statistical inferences followed .",
    "each result is quoted as the maximum likelihood value with an asymmetric @xmath193 confidence interval calculated as the 68% interval of highest density . for @xmath7 bands we also calculated 95% confidence upper limits ; the limits were derived using only the portion of the likelihood curves in the physical region of positive bandpower .",
    "the calculation of the joint likelihood was accelerated by the method of signal - to - noise eigenmodes @xcite , which transforms equation   into a simple algebraic expression that determines the likelihood on any dense one - dimensional subset of the @xmath184-dimensional parameter space with only two expensive matrix operations .",
    "for the two - band analysis , we calculated the joint likelihood on a 60-element grid of such subspaces and obtained the marginalized likelihoods by numerical integration . for larger @xmath184 ,",
    "a useful procedure was to use the signal - to - noise eigenmode method to obtain @xmath184 _ conditional likelihoods _",
    "@xmath194 , in which the likelihood for the @xmath195th band was calculated as a one - dimensional function with the other @xmath196 bands fixed to the maximum likelihood location .",
    "these were only approximations to the true marginal distributions , but in practice they were not much different and could be computed with significantly less effort ; they were valuable both as diagnostic tools and as components of more complicated analyses .",
    "we found that the marginalized likelihoods in the two - band @xmath197 case were not significantly different from the conditional likelihoods , which was expected from the orthogonality of @xmath10 and @xmath7 due to the uniform parallactic angle coverage of the scan strategy .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath10 and @xmath7 bands was less than @xmath53 .",
    "we assigned errors to @xmath186 bandpowers by fixing @xmath10 and @xmath7 to their maximum likelihood values ( computed assuming @xmath198 ) and then computing conditional likelihoods in @xmath186 , rather than marginalizing over @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "the reason is that we found @xmath186 bandpowers to be correlated significantly with the others , but there was a strong prior belief that @xmath198 . likewise ,",
    "when we assigned errors to @xmath10 and @xmath7 bandpowers , we did not include additional uncertainty from marginalizing over @xmath186 .",
    "for the 14-band analysis , we sampled the marginal distribution using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) .",
    "the specifics differed for the two pipelines and are discussed briefly in the following ; further details are given in @xcite and @xcite .      since the signal and noise covariance matrices were dense matrices of size @xmath199 , and",
    "likelihood operations typically involve @xmath200 matrix operations , several optimizations were required to make the mcmc analysis computationally feasible .",
    "the first optimization was the use of signal - to - noise eigenmodes to reduce the effective matrix size ; after a few @xmath200 operations to pre - compute the eigenmodes and signal covariance matrices , subsequent likelihood operations could be performed using matrices of smaller size @xmath201 . for capmap",
    ", we found that no information was lost by choosing @xmath202 , reducing the dimensionality by more than a factor of @xmath203 .",
    "the efficient calculation of conditional likelihoods enabled a fast mcmc technique using gibbs sampling .",
    "the joint likelihood @xmath204 was sampled by sampling the conditional likelihoods repeatedly .",
    "after the @xmath205th iteration , we had a new mcmc sample @xmath206 from the joint likelihood , and we saved the conditional likelihoods @xmath207 .",
    "one can show that the conditional likelihood averaged over mcmc samples , @xmath208 converges to the marginalized likelihood @xmath209 . by generating a full conditional likelihood in each iteration , rather than just generating samples ,",
    "the rate of convergence was dramatically improved .",
    "we found that only @xmath210 mcmc samples were needed to obtain convergence .",
    "we used the standard metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite with a gaussian proposal density .",
    "we matched the proposal density closely to the actual marginal distributions by first calculating the conditional likelihoods , obtaining acceptance probabilities as high as 70% .",
    "we used 350000 mcmc samples to obtain the final results , although convergence was typically achieved with 35 times fewer samples .    because of the fourier space optimization , it was also feasible to calculate the joint likelihood by a brute force evaluation of equation   on a @xmath211-element grid for @xmath212 .",
    "this enabled us to verify that our mcmc implementation correctly reconstructed the marginalized likelihoods .",
    "all aspects of both pipelines were tested extensively on simulated data sets . to create a _",
    "full - season simulation _ , we processed the complete data set , replacing each 100-hz sample for all 44 channels and all 280000 cycles with a data point drawn at the same ra , declination and parallactic angle from a simulated cmb realization of the capmap field , with gaussian noise added at the same level present in the real data at that time",
    ". the simulated timestreams were then processed into simulated map vectors by the binning and mapmaking codes , applying the same data selection used for the real data .",
    "the resulting map vector had the same white noise properties as the actual data set , but a known underlying cmb signal , which could be set to have any desired power spectrum , typically the concordance model for @xmath10 and zero power for @xmath7 .",

    "the maximum likelihood estimator algorithms were verified to be unbiased at the subpercent level ( much smaller than the statistical error bars ) , and the asymmetric confidence intervals were verified to have the expected statistical properties , in all @xmath5 bands .",
    "timestream simulations were exchanged between the two pipelines , verifying that they were consistent with each other as well as internally .    for pipeline 2 , it was also convenient to generate simulated receiver maps in the ( @xmath13 , lst ) binning space directly for many studies .",
    "each such simulation could be generated in only a few minutes , and the mapmaking and power spectrum estimation proceeded with similar speed in the half - fourier space .",
    "the pipelines were designed to allow a suite of _",
    "null tests_statistics that explored a large set of possible sources of contamination and systematic uncertainty .",
    "the first step was to make separate maps @xmath213 and @xmath214 for two disjoint subsets of the data ( where @xmath215 denote the noise covariance matrices and @xmath216 denote the map vectors ) .",
    "we then constructed a null map @xmath217 as : @xmath218 and we performed a two - band power spectrum analysis on the null map , fitting both @xmath10 and @xmath7 as flat bandpowers .",
    "the null maps were constructed to have no contribution from the cmb and thus be consistent with zero signal .",
    "this procedure tested for systematic contamination associated with the way in which the data were divided into subsets , e.g.  sun contamination in the case of a day / night split .",
    "furthermore , the null maps could be examined at early stages of the analysis without biasing the final results .",
    "the differencing procedure defined by equation   is appropriate when the two maps have the same spatial resolution .",
    "this was the case for almost all of our null maps , but there was one important exception : the _ q@xmath219w null map _ , which tests for overall agreement between the two frequency bands . in this case",
    ", we handled the distinct beam sizes by degrading the w - band map to the coarser q - band beam size before differencing using equation  .",
    "the degrading operation was performed directly in map space and applied consistently to the noise covariance matrix as well as the map vector .",
    "since the null map was limited already by the coarser resolution , no information was lost in this procedure .",
    "map differencing with distinct beam sizes was only implemented in pipeline 1 , because this procedure mixes @xmath164 fourier modes .",
    "we summarized likelihoods resulting from null maps with an _",

    "pipeline 2 required the noise for each polarimeter to be approximately independent of lst . although the noise condition was satisfied for the full - season data set and was also adequately satisfied for the three periods , this limitation prevented pipeline 2 from performing such tests as the day / night null test and the foreground study in which several possible point sources were excised .",
    "pipeline 2 ran routinely with @xmath163 pixels and determined 14-band conditional likelihoods in 48 cpu hours ; pipeline 1 , running with @xmath158 pixels , took about 175 cpu hours for the same task ( @xmath158 pixels were small enough , given the noise levels ) .",

    "we detect polarization at @xmath6 , and our highest @xmath5 bandpowers , while not of sufficient precision for a detection at the expected level , nevertheless extend the community data set into these scales .",
    "our results , like all those already published , are in good agreement with the concordance model .",
    "figure  [ fig : bblimits ] presents our @xmath7 results , interpreted as 95% cl exclusions , again in comparison to previous work . while no experiment is yet sufficiently close to detection of gravitational lensing , our sensitivity is among the best .",
    "we mention again our result on the q@xmath219w map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results3 ] ) . unlike the suite of 72 null tests described in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , this one did not have to pass ; that it did pass constitutes an additional science result  we find that maps from both frequencies are consistent with the same underlying cmb realization and hence limit foreground contamination .",
    "our @xmath20/@xmath21 coverage was very uniform , owing to the ring scan strategy , so that our @xmath10 and @xmath7 bandpowers were largely uncorrelated .",
    "the scan strategy provided other benefits , including continuous monitoring of the opacity and data quality .",
    "we exploited the symmetry of the survey region to explore the speed advantages of analysis in a half - fourier space .",
    "our two complementary pipelines were fully tested with end - to - end simulations , and a variety of systematic uncertainties were estimated from detailed simulations .",
    "we emphasize here that our approach was conservative : our selection criteria , in particular , were ( in part ) based on the performance of the suite of null tests .",
    "we note that while the null tests might have passed or failed depending on choices of cuts , the final results themselves were quite insensitive to cutting parameters .",
    "the situation was the same with ground - synchronous structure (  [ sec : data_selection ] ) : we projected out such a mode in the analysis , and reported results with the associated loss in sensitivity , but in fact not doing so made no significant change to the recovered central values .",
    "similarly , we projected out five modes associated with the ring scan , but analyzing with only three modes removed left the results statistically unchanged ( but with smaller errors ) .",
    "it might seem surprising that the polarization results from capmap , which took data for just a few months and observed from not a particularly ideal location , compare to those from other experiments operating with comparable numbers of detectors and observing for longer times from sites regarded as the best on the planet .",
    "there are a few factors that contributed to this : our noise was sufficiently well understood that we were able to use auto- ( rather than only cross- ) correlation power spectra ; the stability of our residual ground - synchronous structure allowed us to remove ground contamination with a smaller number of modes than experiments that use field differencing ; and the 7  m telescope allowed us to center our sensitivity in multipole space where the expected signal , for both @xmath2- and @xmath3-modes , is maximal .",
    "the next target at fine angular scales is the detection of @xmath7 power from lensing ; reaching this goal will be a challenge , requiring more detectors and even better immunity from systematic uncertainty .",
