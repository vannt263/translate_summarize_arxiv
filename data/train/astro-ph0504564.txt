    "a general feature of degenerate fermi systems is that they become unstable if there exist any attractive interaction at the fermi surface .",
    "as recognized by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite this instability leads to the formation of a condensate of cooper pairs and the appearance of superconductivity . in qcd any attractive quark - quark interaction will lead to pairing and color superconductivity , a subject already addressed in the late 1970s and early 1980s @xcite which came back a few years ago since the realization that the typical superconducting gaps in quark matter may be larger than those predicted in these early works ( @xmath2 as high as @xmath5 mev ) @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of qcd has been analyzed in the light of color superconductivity and model calculations suggest that the phase structure is very rich at high densities . depending on the number of flavors , the quark masses , the interaction channels , and other variables many possible @xmath1-stable color superconducting phases of quark matter are possible @xcite .",
    "there is at present some indication that the quark gluon plasma might have been produced in laboratory @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet established whether deconfinement happens in nature in the high density , low temperature regime that is relevant for neutron stars .",
    "unfortunately , first principle calculations are not available in this region of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "in turn we shall base our analysis on phenomenological considerations which could delineate at least a broad brush picture of the physics involved .",
    "matter in compact stars should be electrically neutral and colorless in bulk .",
    "also , any equilibrium configuration of such matter should remain in @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "satisfying these requirements impose nontrivial relations between the chemical potentials of different quarks .",
    "moreover , such relations substantially influence the pairing dynamics between quarks , for instance , by suppressing some color superconducting phases and by favoring others @xcite .    at not very large densities ,",
    "the appearance of strange quarks is suppressed because of their finite mass and quark matter is composed almost completely by quarks @xmath6 and @xmath7 . pairing between them",
    "would be possible if their fermi momenta are not very different .",
    "the resulting pairing pattern is the so - called two - flavor color superconductor ( 2sc ) in which the up and down quarks form cooper pairs in the color - antitriplet , flavor - singlet , spin - zero channel . in the conventional picture of the 2sc phase it is assumed that pairs are formed by up - red ( @xmath8 ) and down - green ( @xmath9 ) quarks , as well as by up - green ( @xmath10 ) and down - red ( @xmath11 ) quarks . the other two quarks ( @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 ) do not participate in pairing .",
    "a more recent analysis shows that the ground state of dense up - and - down quark matter under local and global charge neutrality conditions with @xmath1-equilibrium has at least four possibilities : normal , regular 2sc , gapless 2sc phases , and mixed phase composed of 2sc phase and normal components @xcite .",
    "a new interesting feature of some of these phases is that pairing is allowed between particles even in the case @xmath14 @xcite .    at sufficiently large densities the value of the chemical potential exceeds the mass of the strange quark @xmath15 .",
    "strange quarks appear in the mixture , and cooper pairing can happen between up , down and strange quarks . pairing involving strange quarks is expected to exist if the resulting gaps ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) are larger than @xmath18 , the difference between the @xmath6 and @xmath19 fermi momenta in the absence of pairing . depending on the value of the strange quark mass , as well as other parameters in the theory , many different paired configurations are possible . at very high densities",
    "it seems clear that the color - flavor locked phase ( cfl ) is the ground state .",
    "however , at not very large densities , it is possible that up and down quarks form 2sc matter , while the strange quarks do not participate in pairing , eventually forming a @xmath20 condensate with a much smaller gap .",
    "finally , even more exotic crystalline phases of 1sc quark matter have been analyzed .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all previous works about color superconductivity in compact stars have dealt with matter in @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "this is the situation expected to appear in strange stars or hybrid stars as soon as they settle in a stable configuration .",
    "however , during the deconfinement transition in neutron stars , matter is transitorily out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions .",
    "in fact , the transition from @xmath1-stable hadron matter to quark matter in cold neutron stars should occur trough a quantum nucleation process @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations could form both virtual drops of unpaired quark matter ( hereafter the @xmath21 phase ) or virtual drops of color - superconducting quark matter ( @xmath22 phase ) . in both cases , the flavor content of the quark matter",
    "virtual drop must be equal to that of the confined @xmath1-stable hadronic phase at the same pressure ( the central pressure of the hadronic star ) .",
    "in fact , since quark deconfinement and quark - quark pairing are due to the strong interaction , the oscillation time @xmath23 of a virtual quark droplet in the potential energy barrier separating the hadronic from the quark phase , is of the same order of the strong interaction characteristic time ( @xmath24 s ) .",
    "the latter is many orders of magnitude smaller than the weak interaction characteristic time ( @xmath25 s ) .",
    "thus , quark flavor must be conserved forming a virtual drop of quark matter @xcite . which one of the two kind of droplets ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) will nucleate depends on the value of the corresponding gibbs free energy per baryon ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "in fact , the latter quantity enters in the expression of the volume term of the energy barrier separating the confined and deconfined phases ( see e.g. eq . ( 7 ) in @xcite , where the gibbs free energy per baryon is denoted by @xmath28 ) .",
    "clearly , when @xmath29 the nucleation of a @xmath22 drop will be realized .",
    "the direct formation by quantum fluctuations of a drop of @xmath1-stable quark matter ( q phase ) is also possible in principle .",
    "however , it is strongly suppressed with respect to the formation of the non @xmath1-stable drop by a factor @xmath30 being @xmath31 the number of particles in the critical size quark drop . this is so because the formation of a @xmath1-stable drop will imply the almost simultaneous conversion of @xmath32 up and down quarks into strange quarks . for a critical size @xmath1-stable nugget at the center of a neutron star",
    "it is found @xmath33 , and therefore the factor is actually tiny .",
    "this is the same reason that impedes that an iron nucleus converts into a drop of strange quark matter , even in the case in which strange quark matter had a lower energy per baryon ( bodmer - witten - terazawa hypothesis ) .",
    "because of this reason it is assumed that a direct transition to @xmath1-stable quark matter is not possible . therefore , the @xmath1-stable state @xmath34 could be reached only after the @xmath1-decay of the intermediate state @xmath35 .",
    "this is in agreement with many other previous works , see e.g. @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "one question addressed by the present work is whether the system settles in a paired or in an unpaired state just after the deconfinement .",
    "on the other hand , notice that although the above mentioned non-@xmath1-stable quark phase is very short - lived , it constitutes an unavoidable intermediate state that must be reached before arriving to the final @xmath1-stable configuration , e.g. cfl quark matter ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . the second question we shall address is whether this intermediate phase can eventually preclude the transition to the final @xmath1-stable state in spite of the latter having a lower energy .",
    "this is because the @xmath34-phase can be formed only after the nucleation of a real ( i.e critical size ) drop of @xmath21 or @xmath22 matter , and its subsequent `` long term '' ( @xmath36s ) weak decay process .    ) , non-@xmath1-stable `` just - deconfined '' matter ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath1-stable quark matter ( @xmath34 ) for different cases . in the case of panel",
    "a ) the transition can never occur inside neutron stars in spite of the final state ( q ) having a lower energy per baryon .",
    "as explained in the text , a direct transition to q is strongly suppressed . since @xmath35 has a larger energy per baryon than @xmath37 for all pressures below the central pressure of the maximum mass hadronic star ( @xmath38 )",
    ", deconfinement can not occur even if the @xmath34 phase has a lower energy . in panels",
    "b ) and c ) the phase @xmath35 has a lower energy per baryon than @xmath37 for some pressures below ( @xmath38 ) . therefore , deconfinement is possible if pressures between @xmath39 and @xmath38 are reached inside a given neutron star .",
    "the difference between panels b ) and c ) is the energy per particle at zero pressure ( indicated with a dot for @xmath34 and with an asterisk for @xmath37 ) . in b ) quark stars are the so called strange stars , because they can be made up of quark matter from the center up to the surface ( p=0 ) . in case",
    "c ) they are hybrid stars , because at zero pressure @xmath37 has a lower energy than @xmath34 . for a fixed hadronic equation of state",
    ", these possibilities correspond to different values of the parameters of the quark model ( the vacuum energy density @xmath3 and the superconducting gap @xmath2).,width=264 ]",
    "given the uncertainties in the nature of matter at high densities , the analysis is based on the extrapolation to higher densities of an hadronic model valid around the nuclear saturation density @xmath40 , and the extrapolation to @xmath40 of a quark model that is expected to be valid only for @xmath41 . within this kind of analysis the ( in general ) different functional form of both eoss , induces the phase transition to be first order .",
    "notice that from lattice qcd calculations there are indications that the transition is actually first order in the high - density and low - temperature regime , although this calculations involve temperatures that are still larger than those in neutron stars , and do not include the effect of color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "deconfinement is analyzed here as a first order phase transition that conserves the flavor abundances in both phases .",
    "therefore , it gives a transitory colorless - quark - phase that is _ not _ in @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "for describing the just deconfined quark phase we shall model it as a free fermi mixture of quarks and leptons and we will subtract the pairing and the vacuum energy .",

    "therefore , we shall set @xmath54 along this work .",
    "note that for color - flavor - locked quark matter it is @xmath55 .",
    "as already emphasized by rajagopal and wilczeck @xcite , the exact nature of the interaction that generates @xmath2 is not relevant to the order we are working .",
    "this means that @xmath56 is given by the above prescription regardless of whether the pairing is due to a point like four - fermi interaction , as in nambu - jona - lasinio models @xcite , or due to the exchange of a gluon , as in qcd at asymptotically high energies .",
    "of course , the strength and form of the interaction determine the value of @xmath2 , and also its dependence with the density .",
    "lacking of an accurate calculation for @xmath2 , which may as large as @xmath57 100 mev ( and even larger in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite ) , we shall keep it as a free constant parameter .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities are straightforwardly derived from the standard expressions : the pressure is @xmath58 and the energy density at zero temperature is given by @xmath59 , where the sum is to be carried over all quarks and leptons .",
    "in particular , the particle number densities @xmath60 are given by    @xmath61    for the quarks that participate in pairing , and by    @xmath62    for quarks that do not pair .",
    "the number density of each flavor in the quark phase is given by @xmath63 and the baryon number density @xmath64 by @xmath65    in order to close the above equations we need to impose additional physical conditions describing the composition of the mixture ( e.g. a set of conditions on the chemical potentials ) .",
    "one possibility , extensively employed in the literature , is @xmath1-equilibrium of the quark phase .",
    "this condition describes matter a sufficiently large time after deconfinement ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , for studying deconfinement , the relevant timescale is @xmath67 .",
    "as already emphasized in @xcite the appropriate condition for @xmath67 is flavor conservation between hadronic and deconfined quark matter .",
    "this can be written as    @xmath68    being @xmath69 and @xmath70 the abundances of each particle in the hadron and quark phase respectively ( we shall omit the super - indexes @xmath37 and @xmath34 in the following ) .",
    "in other words , the just deconfined quark phase must have the same `` flavor '' composition than the @xmath1-stable hadronic phase from which it originated .",
    "additionally , the deconfined phase must be locally colorless ; therefore , it must be composed by an equal number or red , green and blue quarks :    @xmath71    being @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 the number densities of red , green and blue quarks respectively , given by : @xmath75 color neutrality can be automatically fulfilled by imposing that each flavor must be colorless separately , i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "but in general this configuration will not allow pairing with a significant gap .",
    "as already stated , for quarks having different color and flavor the pairing gap may be as large as @xmath79 mev , while for particles having the same flavor the gap is found to be about two orders of magnitude smaller ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "pairing is allowed even in the case @xmath14 but the corresponding gaps are small @xcite",
    ". therefore , in order to allow pairing between quarks with a non negligible gap , the fermi momenta of at least @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks must be equal ( the choice of these two particular colors and flavors is just a convention ) .",
    "this implies the equality of the corresponding number densities    @xmath80    the above condition represents a state that fulfills all the physical requirements of the deconfined phase ( e.g. is color and electrically neutral ) , and should be the actual state ( for @xmath67 ) if it has the lowest free energy per baryon .",
    "energy must be paid in order to equal at least two fermi seas , but in compensation the pairing energy is recovered .",
    "the gained energy depends on the value of the pairing gap @xmath2 and , at least for sufficiently large @xmath2 , is expected to be larger than the energy invested to force a pairing pattern .",
    "also , notice that color conversion of quarks allows the adjustment of the fermi seas within a given flavor in a very short timescale ( @xmath81 ) , i.e. several orders of magnitude faster than @xmath1-equilibration ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we emphasize that this phase is _ not _ in flavor equilibrium .",
    "after a weak interaction timescale this transitory pairing pattern will be abandoned by the system in favor of the lowest - energy @xmath1-stable configuration .",
    "depending on the density , the lowest energy state may be loff , gapless 2sc , gapless cfl , standard cfl , ( to name just some possibilities ) as extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "[ gibbs1 ]    a simple solution can be found in the case of the deconfinement of pure neutron matter , since strange quarks and electrons are not present in the hadronic gas .",

    "it is also worth noting that since we are comparing the gibbs energy per baryon of different phases at equal pressures ( alternatively , we could compare the pressure at fixed gibbs energy per baryon ) , the results depend on the bag constant @xmath3 .",
    "this dependence is not found in the comparisons for @xmath1-stable quark matter made in @xcite because the bag constant @xmath3 cancels out when comparing @xmath107 at fixed @xmath108 .",

    "we have deduced the equations governing deconfinement when quark pairing is allowed and , employing a realistic equation of state for hadronic matter , we have found the regions of the parameter space @xmath3 versus @xmath2 where the deconfinement transition is possible inside neutron stars .",
    "the main results are shown in figs .",
    "[ pstar1 ] and [ pstar2 ] and were explained in the last section . in the following",
    "we discuss some implications for neutron star structure .",
    "stars containing quark phases fall into two main classes : hybrid stars ( where quark matter is restricted to the core ) and strange stars ( made up completely by quark matter ) .",
    "this structural characteristic depends on whether the energy per baryon of @xmath1-equilibrated quark matter at zero pressure and zero temperature is less than the neutron mass ( the so called `` absolute stability '' condition ) . in the absence of pairing ,",
    "quark matter in @xmath1-equilibrium has an energy per baryon ( at @xmath182 ) smaller than the neutron mass only if @xmath3 is in the range @xmath183 mev @xmath184 @xmath185 90 mev @xmath184 . within this range of @xmath3 ,",
    "unpaired @xmath1-stable quark matter is the so called strange quark matter , and it is possible the existence of stars made up entirely by the quark phase . for @xmath186 mev",
    "@xmath184 unpaired @xmath1-stable quark matter at @xmath182 and @xmath93 decays into hadrons , and",
    "therefore it can be present only in the core of neutron stars .",
    "the size of the core ( if any ) depends on the value of @xmath3 : the larger the value of @xmath3 , the smaller the size of the quark matter core ( for a given neutron star mass ) .    pairing enlarges substantially the region of the parameter space where @xmath1-stable quark matter has an energy per baryon smaller than the neutron mass @xcite .",
    "although the gap effect does not dominate the energetics , being of the order ( @xmath187 a few percent , the effect is substantially large near the zero - pressure point ( which determines the stability and also the properties of the outer layers and surface of the star ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a `` cfl strange matter '' is allowed for the same parameters that would otherwise produce unbound strange matter without pairing @xcite . the line separating strange matter from non - absolutely stable quark matter",
    "is shown in dotted line in figs .",
    "[ pstar1 ] and [ pstar2 ] , according to @xcite .    concerning just deconfined quark matter ( i.e. not in @xmath1-equilibrium )",
    "it has been already shown that the transition to _ unpaired _ quark matter is not possible in a 1.6 @xmath179 neutron star if the bag constant is @xmath188 mev @xmath184 , because the transition pressure is never reached inside the star , even in the proto - neutron star phase @xcite .",
    "the results when pairing is allowed have been shown in the previous section , where we have shown the `` deconfinement '' parameter space for the maximum mass neutron star with the gm1 eos ( 1.8 @xmath179 ) , and for a 1.6 @xmath179 neutron star . as it is evident from figs .",
    "[ pstar1 ] and [ pstar2 ] , deconfinement is facilitated for large @xmath2 ( i.e. it is possible for a larger range of @xmath3 ) .",
    "this result can be roughly understood if we think paired matter as unpaired matter with an effective bag constant depending on the chemical potential ( or on density ) : @xmath189 .",
    "the minus sign of the condensation term in the previous expression allows deconfinement for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , notice that this simple interpretation is not strictly correct because the chemical equilibrium is different in paired and unpaired phases .",
    "in fact , due to the more convenient chemical equilibrium , the unpaired phase is energetically preferred for small @xmath2 .    for a large part of the deconfined parameter - space @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 , @xmath1-stable quark matter has ( at any pressure ) an energy per baryon smaller than the neutron mass .",
    "the situation corresponds to the one sketched in fig",
    "therefore , if quark stars are formed , they would be made up of quark matter from the center up to the surface . in figs .",
    "[ pstar1 ] and [ pstar2 ] this corresponds to the part of the grey and the white regions to the left of the dotted line .    to the right of the dotted line of figs .",
    "[ pstar1 ] and [ pstar2 ] stars containing quark phases are hybrid .",
    "the situation corresponds to the one sketched in fig .",
    "1c , i.e. the hadronic phase is preferred at low pressures . from the point of view of the structural properties ,",
    "stable hybrid stars have been found to be possible in a wide region of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , notice that these configurations could not form in practice if they fall in the region where deconfinement is forbidden ( dashed region of figs .",
    "[ pstar1 ] and [ pstar2 ] ) .",
    "that is , for a given hadronic star , there exist a stable hybrid star with the same baryonic mass that has a lower energy ( gravitational mass ) .",
    "nevertheless , the hadronic star can not deconfine because the here studied non-@xmath1-stable _ intermediate _ state has a larger energy per baryon , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "this is the case , for example , if @xmath3 = 153 mev @xmath184 ( @xmath190 mev ) as can be seen by comparing with the results of fig .",
    "5 of the paper by alford and reddy @xcite : for @xmath181 mev , @xmath3 = 153 mev @xmath184 and any reasonable value of @xmath2 , stable hybrid configurations with maximum masses up to 1.6 @xmath179 are found in @xcite .",
    "however , in these cases the pairs ( @xmath4 ) fall comfortably inside the dashed region of fig .",
    "[ pstar2 ] where deconfinement is not allowed . for",
    "the same value of @xmath3 , heavier stars ( @xmath57 1.8 @xmath179 ) could deconfine , since ( @xmath4 ) would be inside the grey region of fig .",

    "although the eoss are different in @xcite and in the present work , this should not affect this generic trend .",
    "notice that qualitatively similar results have been found in @xcite for unpaired quark matter .",
    "a stated in the introduction , the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter proceeds by bubble nucleation .",
    "however , notice that for large @xmath3 the results with typical surface tension @xmath191 do not differ much from the case in bulk @xcite .",
    "this means that we do nt expect that the dashed region of figs .",
    "[ pstar1 ] and [ pstar2 ] will change significantly when including surface effects . anyway , even if the surface tension were very large , the here presented bulk case is still relevant because it gives a lower limit for the transition : i.e. , if deconfinement is not possible in bulk , it will be even more difficult when including surface effects . in other words , the dashed line of figs .",
