    "k(t ) = _ k(t ) _ k(t ) . prior to describing the proposed technique , we comment on two common adiabatic techniques , first intended for complete population transfer but later applied to the preparation of superposition states .",

    "essentially the evolution is adiabatically stopped just when half of the population is transferred .",
    "we refer to this as fractional stirap ( f - stirap ) .",
    "the basic stirap procedure is based on a lambda linkage in which @xmath53 , i.e. a stimulated raman process ( see fig .",

    "it works also in a ladder linkage if the lifetime of the uppermost state is much longer than the interaction time , i.e. the pulse duration  which we will assume in the following .",
    "the process relies on interaction of the system with two laser pulses , termed stokes and pump , which produce overlapping but not coincident interactions , parameterized by rabi frequencies , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the stokes pulse , linking states 2 and 3 , precedes the pump pulse , linking states 1 and 2 .",

    "stirap proceeds to completion when the pump field is strong and the stokes field is negligible , i.e. at the end of the interaction .",
    "the adiabatic state @xmath59 is then aligned with @xmath20 , and complete population transfer has occurred .    by contrast , in f - stirap the pulses need to be terminated simultaneously ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme_comparison]b ) .",

    "two - photon excitations in ladder systems , involving absorption of two photons from one radiation field , permit population transfer to high - lying excited states without the need for lasers with very short wavelength .",
    "however , because such two - photon interactions involve nonresonant couplings to intermediate states ( which can be summarized in a virtual state ) , strong two - photon excitation is inevitably accompanied by dynamic stark shifts .",

    "four - wave mixing , and other nonlinear optics processes , are enhanced by preparing the nonlinear medium in a maximally coherent quantum state , thereby maximizing the induced polarization field . for such purposes",
    "it is necessary to create superpositions of nondegenerate quantum states .",
    "we have introduced an alternative adiabatic technique , sacs , for the preparation of coherent superpositions of two nondegenerate states , 1 and 3 , coupled by a two - photon process .",
