    "the study of galaxies at the highest infrared luminosities , i.e. , luminous @xmath1 ) and ultra - luminous ( @xmath2 ) infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , respectively ) is relevant for many reasons :    * u / lirgs account for about 10% of the total radiant energy production and @xmath0 20% of all the high - mass star - formation in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) . *",
    "the bulk of the energy radiated by ulirgs is infrared emission from warm dust grains heated by a central power source , or sources , whose nature ( agn , starburst , or both ) is often unknown , but whose evolution is likely to be related .",
    "* essentially all lirgs above @xmath3 appear to be interacting galaxies , and all ulirgs seem to be advanced merger systems .",
    "thus they may represent an important stage in the formation of quasi - stellar objects .",
    "* u / lirgs are also of cosmological relevance , as they bear many similarities with star - forming galaxies at high-@xmath4 ( e.g. local uv - bright starbursts are good analogs to lyman break galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . * finally",
    ", u / lirgs are ideal laboratories to study the complex ecosystems of stars , gas , black holes , the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and test massive star and black - hole / starburst evolution , or probe the initial mass function ( imf ) of the high - mass stars .",
    "the critical question concerning u / lirgs is whether the dust in the central regions ( @xmath51  kpc ) is heated by a starburst or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , or a combination of both .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopic studies on samples of ulirgs suggested that the vast majority of these galaxies were powered predominantly by recently formed massive stars , with a significant heating from the agn only in the most luminous objects @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that at least half of ulirgs are probably powered by both an agn and a starburst in a circumnuclear disk or ring .",
    "these circumnuclear regions are typically located at radii @xmath6700  pc from the nucleus of the galaxy , and also contain large quantities of dust .",
    "those facts ( compactness of the emission and dusty environments ) prevent to gain much insight into the nature of the central source , either from optical , or infrared observations .    _",
    "why radio observations ? _ the largely dusty environments of u / lirgs imply huge extinctions in the optical , and even in the infrared , which prevents the direct detection of recent starburst activity , e.g. , via supernova explosions .",
    "the advantage of observing in radio is that these wavelengths are not affected by dust obscuration , thus allowing to see the activity within those deeply buried regions .    _",
    "why high - angular resolution ?",
    "_ at a typical distance of 100 mpc to a local u / lirg , 1  corresponds to a linear size of about 500 pc .",
    "therefore , if one aims at spatially resolving the circumnuclear regions of u / lirgs to understand in detail the ongoing processes in the central regions of those monsters , sub - arcsecond resolution is a must .",
    "this makes an excellent case for high - angular resolution radio observations of u / lirgs , since current radio interferometric arrays provide sub - arcsecond angular resolution ( evla , merlin ) or even milliarsecond resolution , using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "_ how do u / lirgs look in radio ?",
    "_ the central kiloparsec region of many nearby u / lirgs shows a distribution of their radio emission typically consisting of a compact ( @xmath7 200 pc ) , high surface brightness , central radio source corresponding to an active nuclear region ( whether powered by an agn , or a nuclear starburst ) , immersed in a low surface brightness circumnuclear , extended ( @xmath8 1 kpc ) halo @xcite .    as an example , i show in figure [ fig1 ] an 8.46 ghz vla image of the lirg mrk 331 . at a distance of d=75",
    "mpc to mrk  331 , 1  corresponds to a linear size of 357 pc .",
    "note that all radio emission is concentrated in a region whose angular size is less that 3  in diameter , or less than 1  kpc .",
    "the total 8.5 ghz flux density is of @xmath8 29.3  mjy , corresponding to a monochromatic radio luminosity of @xmath9 .    often , the high - surface brightness is not within the central @xmath0200 pc region , but on a prominent circumnuclear ring where a burst of recent star formation is ongoing .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows an 8.46 ghz vla image of the lirg ngc  1614 . at the distance of d=65.6",
    "mpc to ngc  1614 , 1  corresponds to a linear size of 320 pc . as with mrk 331",
    ", all radio emission is concentrated in a region less than 1  kpc in size .",
    "the total 8.5 ghz flux density is of @xmath8 32.9  mjy , corresponding to a monochromatic radio luminosity of @xmath10 , and i note that unlike the case of mrk 331 , where the circumnuclear ring is very faint , about 90% of the radio luminosity from ngc 1614 comes from a prominent circumnuclear ring which is at a distance of @xmath0250 pc from the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "based on those high - angular radio observations , it is evident that , contrary to what we could have thought from a look at a low - angular resolution image , most of the starburst activity happening in ngc  1614 is actually taking place in this ring . by converting the measured flux density into a brightness temperature , @xmath11",
    ", we would find out that this temperature is , in most regions of the ring , much higher than the thermal temperature of the plasma around the massive stars , implying a non - thermal ( synchrotron ) origin for the radio emission .",
    "the natural explanation for this non - thermal emission is that it is due to recent explosions of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which implies that most of the starburst activity is still ongoing ( @xmath12 myr ) in the ring of ngc  1614 .",

    "a large fraction of the massive star - formation at both low- and high-@xmath4 has taken place in u / lirgs @xcite . indeed , by applying evolutionary stellar models to bursts of age 10 - 100 myr , and adopting a standard imf , one can obtain the sfr as a function of @xmath18 @xcite :    @xmath19    while the compact , centrally located radio emission in these galaxies might be generated by a point - like source ( agn ) , or by the combined effect of multiple rsne and supernova remnants ( snrs ) , e.g. , the evolved nuclear starburst in arp  220 ( parra et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) and m  82 ( e.g. muxlow et al .",
    "1994 ) , it seems now well established that in the circumnuclear regions of those objects there is an ongoing burst of star formation producing core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne , type ib / c and type ii sne ) at a high rate ( e.g. ngc 7469 , colina et al .",
    "2001a , b ; arp 299 , neff et al . 2004 ; ngc 6240 , gallimore & beswick 2004 ; arp 220 , parra et al . 2007 ;",

    "therefore , a powerful tracer for ( recent ) starburst activity in u / lirgs is the detection of ccsne .    since stars more massive than m @xmath208 m@xmath21 explode as ccsne , the observed rate at which those stars die ( ) can be used as a direct measurement of the current star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies , and may provide unique information about the initial mass function ( imf ) of the high - mass stars . indeed ,",
    "if for the sake of simplicity we assume a constant star - formation rate for a starburst , it can be shown that ( e.g. @xcite )    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the constant star formation rate in , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the lower and upper mass limits of the initial mass function ( imf , @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 is the minimum mass of stars that yield supernovae , assumed to be 8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the rate at which stars die in normal galaxies is rather low ( e.g. , one sn is expected to explode in the milky way every @xmath050 yr , ) , the ccsn rate in u / lirgs is expected to be at least one to two orders of magnitude higher than in normal galaxies , and hence detections of sne in u / lirgs offer a promising way of determining the current star formation rate in nearby galaxies .",
    "in fact , from equation [ eq : sfr ] , and assuming a salpeter imf ( @xmath28 ) with @xmath25=100 and @xmath24=0.2 , we obtain that a lirg ( ulirg ) is expected to yield about 0.26 ( 2.6 ) sn / yr , or more .",
    "thus , equations [ eq : sfr ] and [ eq : ccsnrate ] imply that u / lirgs are prolific star - forming factories , with lirgs having typical values of sfrs and core - collapse supernova rates of @xmath0(17 - 170 ) and @xmath29(0.3 - 3.0 ) yr@xmath16 , respectively , with ulirgs exceeding those upper ends .",
    "however , the direct detection of ccsne in the extreme densities of the central few hundred pc of u / lirgs is , as pointed out earlier , extremely difficult since emission in the visual band suffers very significant extinction in those regions , which contain large amounts of dust , and can at best yield only a lower limit to the true value of .",
    "fortunately , radio is not affected by dust absorption . moreover ,",
    "significant radio emission from ccsne is expected as opposed to thermonuclear sne as the interaction of the sn ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) gives rise to a high - energy density shell , which is rayleigh - taylor unstable and drives turbulent motions that amplify the existing magnetic field in the presupernova wind , and efficiently accelerate relativistic electrons , thus enhancing the emission of synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "thus , starburst activity in the circumnuclear regions of lirgs ensures both the presence of a high number of massive stars and a dense surrounding medium , so bright radio sne are expected to occur .",
    "those sne can be detected , even in the innermost regions of u / lirgs , by means of high angular resolution ( @xmath30 arcsec ) , high - sensitivity ( @xmath310.05 mjy ) radio searches of ccsne , as radio emission is unaffected by dust extinction , and the angular resolution yielded by current very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) arrays , of the order of a few milliarcsec at cm - wavelengths , is able to unveil nuclear starbursts and detect individual radio supernovae at large distances in the local universe ( e.g. arp  220 , @xcite;arp 299 , @xcite ; see also figure [ fig3 ] ; ic  883 @xcite ) .",

    "is a challenging task , and direct imaging of the innermost few pc can only be accomplished at radio wavelengths , using very high - angular resolution observations .",
    "my team and i started to monitor the a - nucleus of the interacting starburst galaxy arp 299 , using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) radio observations at 1.7 and 5.0 ghz @xcite .",
    "our aim was to characterize the compact sources in the innermost few pc region of arp 299-a , as well as to detect recently exploded core - collapse supernovae .",
    "we imaged with milliarcsecond resolution the inner eight parsecs of the nuclear region in arp 299-a , using contemporaneous evn observations at 1.7 and 5.0 ghz @xcite , and the summary of those results is shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "the morphology , spectral index , radio luminosity , and radio - to - x ray luminosity ratio of the a1-a5 complex are consistent with that of an llagn , and rules out the possibility that it consists of a chain of young rsne and snrs in a young ssc .",
    "we therefore concluded that a1 is the long - sought agn in arp 299-a . since arp 299-a",
    "had long been thought of as a pure starburst , our finding of a buried , low - luminosity agn in its central region , coexisting with a recent burst of starformation , suggests that both a starburst and agn are frequently associated phenomena in mergers . in this case",
    ", our result is likely to have an impact on evolutionary scenarios proposed for agn and the triggering mechanism of activity in general .",
    "we note that component a0 , previously identified as a young rsn by @xcite , is not seen at our low - frequency observations , which implies there must be a foreground absorbing h  ii region , which precludes its detections at frequencies @xmath71.7 ghz .",
    "it is remarkable that this rsn exploded at the mere ( deprojected ) distance of two parsecs from the putative agn in arp 299-a , which makes this supernova one of the closest to a central supermassive black hole ever detected .",
    "this result may also be relevant to accreting models in the central regions of galaxies , since it is not easy to explain the existence of very massive , supernova progenitor stars so close to an agn .",
    "while seemingly contradictory , this could explain the low - luminosity of the agn we see in arp 299-a .",
    "in fact , since massive stars shed large amounts of mechanical energy into their surrounding medium , thereby significantly increasing its temperature , those massive stars would hinder the accretion of material to the central black hole , which could in turn result in a less powerful agn than usual .",
    "( see also @xcite and the contribution of herrero - illana et al . to these proceedings . )",
    "since essentially all of the observed radio emission in the central regions of u / lirgs is of synchrotron origin ( see section 2.1 ) , we can estimate a minimum total energy in magnetic fields , electrons , and heavy particles and a minimum magnetic field for them .",
    "in fact , if we assume equipartition ( magnetic field energy is approximately equal to the total particle energy ) , then the minimum total energy is @xcite    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the radio luminosity of the source between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a characteristic size , @xmath40 is a slowly - dependent function of the observed radio spectral index , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the fraction of the supernova s volume occupied by the magnetic field and by the relativistic particles ( filling factor ) , and @xmath43 is the ratio of the ( total ) heavy particle energy to the electron energy .",
    "this ratio depends on the mechanism that generates the relativistic electrons , ranging from @xmath44 up to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the proton and electron mass , respectively .",
    "a value of @xmath48 seems appropriate for most galaxies @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",

    "the value of the function @xmath40 is @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 , @xmath52 mhz and @xmath5330 ghz ) .",
    "the characteristic size of the synchrotron emitting region in u / lirgs varies from case to case , although the most compact starbursts , typically residing in ulirgs , i.e. , advanced mergers , have sizes of @xmath0100 - 200 pc , and for the sake of simplicity we will use here a nominal value of @xmath54 pc , and a filling factor value , @xmath55 . the total ( synchrotron ) radio luminosity between @xmath52 mhz and @xmath5330 ghz ( for @xmath49 ) can be written as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the flux density , in mjy , at a reference frequency . with these values ,",
    "the minimum total energy and its associated magnetic field  enclosed in a 100 pc region of a u / lirg at a nominal distance of 100 mpc with @xmath57=10 mjy are    @xmath58    @xmath59    where we have set @xmath60 in the above equation , for simplicity .",
    "since @xmath61 , @xmath62 is then between @xmath63 erg and @xmath64 erg , and equals @xmath65 erg for our nominal value of @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding values of the equipartition magnetic field lie then between @xmath67 g ( electrons dominate ) and @xmath68 ( heavy particles dominate ) , and equals @xmath69 mg for our nominal value of @xmath66 .",
    "we see that the energy contained in the central , compact regions ( size @xmath7 100 pc ) of u / lirgs are huge , and the magnetic fields in those ambients are expected to be significant , since the above estimates are lower limits to the real values of the magnetic fields .",
    "values of several hundreds of @xmath70 g , or larger , have been obtained for the central regions of the ulirgs iras  23365 + 3604 @xcite and iras 17208 - 0014 @xcite , in agreement with the advanced - merger scenarios proposed for those ulirgs .",
    "we have just seen that the minimum equipartition total energy in the form of particles and magnetic field emitting by synchrotron radio emission within the central @xmath0100 pc of a u / lirg is huge . in particular ,",
    "the magnetic field is expected to be significantly larger than in normal galaxies , where on average has a value of @xmath71 g , and hence is expected to play a significant role in the physics of those objects .",
    "similarly , since the bolometric luminosity of those beasts is dominated by radiative emission at ir wavelengths , it is also expected that the radiative field plays a significant role . _ but which is the main player here : the radio synchrotron , or the radiative field ? _ in the previous section , we obtained that a typical magnetic field for the central @xmath0100 pc of a u / lirg is @xmath72 g ( assuming @xmath73 ) .",
    "therefore , we can write the energy density of the magnetic field as    @xmath74    since the bolometric luminosity of u / lirgs is dominated by the emission at infrared wavelengths , the energy density of the radiation field can then be written as    @xmath75    thus , _",
    "ic losses are likely to dominate the central @xmath0100 pc regions of u / lirgs , if magnetic fields are close to minimum equipartition estimates_. we note , though , that it may well be that equipartition does not hold in those compact regions .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that minimum equipartition estimates are not reliable , if the nuclear disks in the central regions of u / lirgs are magnetic field supported . in the former case ,",
    "i.e. , when the pressure of the magnetic field is large enough to compete with that of the gas in the nuclear disk , the implied magnetic fields would be high enough so that synchrotron losses would dominate over ic losses .",
    "u / lirgs are embedded in extremely dusty environments , which imply huge extinctions in the optical , and even in the infrared , thus preventing the direct detection of recent starburst activity , e.g. , via supernova explosions .",
    "radio is not affected by dust obscuration , thus allowing to see the activity within those deeply buried regions .",
    "in addition , at the typical distances of @xmath0100 mpc to a local u / lirg , sub - arcsecond angular resolution is mandatory to spatially resolve the circumnuclear regions of u / lirgs , so as to understand in detail the ongoing processes in their central regions .",
    "current radio interferometric arrays provide sub - arcsecond angular resolution ( evla , merlin ) or even milliarsecond resolution , using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , and thus they become a very powerful tool to study u / lirgs .    here , i have presented some of the results obtained by our team , making use of high - angular resolution radio observations , including the impressive discovery of an extremely prolific supernova factory in the central @xmath0150 pc of the galaxy arp 299-a ( d=45 mpc ) and the monitoring of a large number of very compact radio sources in it , or the detection and precise location of the long - sought agn in arp 299-a . in addition , vlbi observations of distant ulirgs in the local universe have allowed us to estimate the energetics in magnetic fields and particles .",
    "the magnetic field estimates , of a few hundred @xmath70 g within the @xmath0200 pc or so , are in agreement with evolutionary scenarios that suggest those ulirgs are advanced mergers .",
    "more recently , we also used vlbi observations of to show evidence for the existence of nuclear disks ( @xmath7100 pc in size ) in starburst galaxies from their radial distribution of supernovae .",

    "<S> a movie summarizing those results can be found in http://www.iaa.es/~torres/research/arp299a.html . </S>",
    "<S> all those results demonstrate that very - high angular resolution studies of nearby u / lirgs are of high relevance for the comprehension of both local and high - z starbursting galaxies . </S>"
