    "presolar silicon carbide ( sic ) is the abundant and well studied dust species among presolar grains extracted from meteorites .",
    "based on the isotopic compositins of c , n , si and al , presolar sic grains are classified into six categories named `` mainstream '' , a , b , x , y and z grains ( e.g. , see @xcite for a review ) . among them , the mainstream grains populating about 90 % of presolar sic grains have been considered to be originated in carbon  rich asymptotic giant branch ( c  rich agb ) stars from the isotopic compositions of c , n , and si @xcite and the s ",
    "process signatures in the noble gases as well as in the heavy elements @xcite .",
    "@xcite have reported that sic grains extracted from the murchison meteorite have a log  normal distribution with the peak at @xmath8 0.4 @xmath12 in diameter , and 70 % of them by number are in the grains whose diameter ranges from 0.3 to 0.7 @xmath12 @xcite . although it was reported that sic grains are more fine grained in other meteorites than in murchison ( see @xcite ) , a significant fraction of presolar sic grains are larger than 0.3 @xmath12 in diameter ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , submicron ",
    "sized sic grains are expected to form around c  rich agb stars .",
    "the presence of sic grains in c  rich agb stars was confirmed from the emission feature around 11.3 @xmath12 @xcite , prior to the discovery of presolar sic grains @xcite .",
    "also , the absorption feature attributed to sic grains was observed in several extreme carbon stars @xcite .",
    "the radiative transfer models fitting the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) including the spectral feature attributed to sic grains have estimated the mass ratio of sic to carbon grains to be in the range of 0.010.3 @xcite .",
    "the variation of the mass ratio of sic to carbon derived from the radiative transfer models arises from the grain models used , and the value could be also influenced by the optical constants of sic used in the radiative transfer models ( see the discussion in section 6 ) .",
    "although the isotopic signatures of presolar sic grains and the observed spectral feature around 11.3 @xmath12 support the formation of sic grains in circumstellar envelopes of c  rich agb stars , the formation process as well as the formation conditions remain unknown and debatable : thermodynamic equilibrium calculations have been applied to investigate the formation condition of dust grains in c  rich agb stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the calculations have claimed that high gas pressure ( 0.3300 dyne @xmath13 ) and low c / o ratio ( 1.0 @xmath14 c / o @xmath15 1.1 ) is necessary for reproducing the condensation sequence of presolar tic , graphite , and sic grains in this order inferred from the presence of graphitic spherules containing a tic core @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite suggested the formation of sic grains earlier than carbon grains , considering the inverse greenhouse effect that the temperature of sic grains which is transparent in the optical to near infrared ( nir ) region @xcite is lower than the temperature of carbon grains in circumstellar envelopes of c  rich agb stars .",
    "in addition , the interferometric observation of irc+10216 at 11 @xmath12 has suggested the presence of dust species more transparent than carbon grains in the inner circumstellar envelope close to the photosphere @xcite .",
    "although thermodynamic equilibrium calculations can tell us the physical conditions in which a condensate exists stably , the calculations as well as the astronomical observations provide directly no information on the number and size of grains that are essential to clarify the physical conditions prevailing in the formation sites of grains and the physical and chemical processing suffering in the interstellar space . also , it should be pointed out here that the c / o ratio in c  rich agb stars is not restricted to be less than 1.1 , and tends to increase with decreasing the effective temperature @xmath6 ; the low c / o ratio observed in stars with @xmath6 @xmath15 2500 k is considered to be caused by the neglect of formation of dust in the model atmosphere @xcite .    so far dust formation around c  rich agb stars has been investigated in the framework of pulsation  enhanced dust  driven wind models since the study by @xcite , and it has been believed that the hydrodynamical models including only the formation of carbon grains well reproduce the observed dynamical behavior of c  rich agb stars whose mass loss rates exceed 10@xmath16 @xmath2 yr@xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the formation of sic grains has not yet pursued in the hydrodynamical models .",
    "on the other hand , formation of a variety of dust species including sic grains has been studied in the steady state dust  driven wind models around agb stars in order to investigate the evolution of dust in the interstellar space ( see @xcite ) . however , in the models , the number of seed nuclei is assumed in the formation process .",
    "although the models may predict the mass of dust species supplied from agb stars , no information is available for the size distribution . taking into account the nucleation process and including the",
    "so  called inverse greenhouse effect , @xcite have investigated the formation of sic grains in an outflowing gas with constant velocity around c  rich agb stars and shown that sic grains condense prior to carbon grains for the mass  loss rate smaller than @xmath8 1.5 @xmath18 10@xmath19 @xmath2 yr@xmath17 ; otherwise composite grains consisting of carbon and sic form",
    ". the calculated radius of @xmath8 0.01 @xmath12 is too small to reproduce the size of presolar sic grains and the proposed grains consisting of a sic core and a carbon mantle have not been discovered except for one in presolar grains @xcite .",
    "thus the investigation of formation of sic grains in a more realistic hydrodynamical model remains an important subject to be explored which will reveal the formation process and condition around c  rich agb stars .",
    "the knowledge of not only the amount but also the size distribution of dust grains is crucial for investigating the role of dust in the universe as shown by @xcite . in particular , the size distribution of sic grains formed around c  rich agb stars is vital to get insight into the evolution and processing during the journey from the formation sites to the incorporation into meteorites from the analysis of presolar sic grains .    in this paper , we aim at exploring the formation process of sic grains and investigating the amount as well as the size distribution in the framework of pulsation  enhanced dust  driven wind from c  rich agb stars .",
    "we develop the hydrodynamical model including formation of carbon and sic grains as well as a non  grey radiative transfer .",
    "the formulation by @xcite is applied for the nucleation and growth processes of carbon grains .",
    "we assert that sic grains nucleate and grow homogeneously starting from sic molecule because all presolar sic grains whose internal structure has thus far been analyzed do not contain any seed nuclei at their centers @xcite .",
    "furthermore there is no evidence in presolar graphite grains for a sic seed nuclei except for one grain @xcite .",
    "the two cases are considered for the formation process of sic grains ; one is the lte case where the vibration temperature @xmath0 of sic cluster is the same as the gas temperature as usual .",
    "another is the non  lte case taking into account the inverse greenhouse effect on the formation , in which @xmath0 is assumed to be the same as the temperature of small sic grains .",
    "we will show that the mass ratio of sic to carbon grains and the radius of sic grains are at most 10@xmath16 and 0.1 @xmath12 , respectively , in the lte case , while the mass ratio ranges from 0.098 to 0.23 and the typical radius ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 @xmath12 for the sticking probability @xmath10 of 0.11.0 in the non  lte case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; the chemical reactions and gas species relevant to the formation of sic grains are examined and the formation process of sic grains is formulated in section 2 , and the numerical scheme for calculation of grain formation is presented in section 3 , including the method for tracing the size distribution . section 4 describes the hydrodynamical model and the modeling procedure for pulsation  enhanced dust ",

    "in the hydrodynamical models of pulsation  enhanced dust  driven wind from c  rich agb stars so far developed since the work of @xcite , the formation of carbon grains has been processed according to the recipe developed by @xcite ; the abundances of gas species responsible for the nucleation and growth of carbon grains are assumed to be in chemical equilibrium in the gas whose elemental abundance is solar except for carbon . in the recipe based on @xcite , the formation of clusters with number of constituent molecules ( size ) up to @xmath20=1000 is evaluated from the steady  state nucleation rate , and the growth and evaporation of grains with size @xmath21 is treated as macroscopic grains .",
    "the formation of carbon grains are considered to proceed through the two body reactions of c@xmath22h@xmath22 and c@xmath22h molecules with carbon clusters , starting from atomic carbon or diatomic carbon molecule .    in this section",
    ", we shall explore the formation process of sic grains around c  rich agb stars , following the formulation for the formation of carbon grains @xcite .",
    "first we examine the gas species responsible for the nucleation and the growth processes of sic grains from chemical equilibrium calculations . in the same way as the formation of carbon grains",
    ", we consider that the nucleation process proceeds through the two body reactions of cluster with gas species , starting from the molecules whose stoichiometric composition is the same as sic grains . on the other hand , we allow three or more body reactions on the surface for the growth process . then , the basic equations describing the nucleation and growth processes of sic grains are presented .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of relative abundances of si  bearing molecules ( left ) and c  bearing molecules ( right ) in chemical equilibrium in the gas with the density @xmath23 10@xmath24 g @xmath25 and c / o = 1.4 , which is calculated by the method of the minimization of the gibbs free energies .",

    "also , it should be noted that @xmath0 is not affected so much by the backwarming due to the thermal emission from the outer carbon dust shell compared with the gas temperature .",
    "thus , the temperature difference @xmath182 is magnified in the less dense region inner than the opaque carbon dust shell ( e.g. , see around 2.5 @xmath150 at @xmath94=167.3 @xmath7 ) .",
    "as the gas density decreases , the supersaturation ratio of sic grains quickly exceeds unity with increasing @xmath183 as well as decreasing @xmath0 .",

    "thus , the si  depletion region forms once every two pulsation periods . also , even in the other regions , the resulting value of @xmath162 often exceeds 0.1 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the very small value of at most 10@xmath16 in lte case , a large amount of sic grains can condense through the inverse greenhouse effect in the non  lte case .",
    "figure 6 presents the radial variations of gas and grains at @xmath94=176.3 @xmath7 .",
    "it seems that sic grains are concentrated around the outer boundaries of 1st type cdss in the density distribution ( see the top row ) because the shock associated with the formation of carbon dust shell sweeps up the gas .",
    "reflecting the variation of gas density , the radial distribution of @xmath175 does not always corresponds to the si ",
    "depletion region shown in the 2nd row .",
    "it should be noted that the extended si  depletion region does not develop without the 2nd type cds , which can be demonstrated from an example of the failure of alternating formation of both types of carbon dust shells located at 18 @xmath150 where si  depletion region restricted in a narrow region resides just ahead of the 1st type cds formed about 1 cycle after from the formation of the si  depletion region ( see the 2nd row ) .",
    "apart from the 1st type cds located at 18 @xmath150 , the extended sic dust shell corresponding to the si  depletion region between 1st and 2nd type cdss can be clearly recognized in the radial distribution of @xmath188 ( see the 3rd row where @xmath188=8.46@xmath1810@xmath189 corresponding to @xmath162 = 1.0 ) .",
    "the radial distribution of @xmath162 shows that the si  depletion region stretched over by the slower moving 2nd type cds narrows with moving outwardly , being compressed by the faster moving 1st type cds .",
    "thus , in the outer circumstellar envelope , the radial width tends to be of the order of the stellar radius ( see @xmath162 around 24 @xmath150 where the 2nd type cds almost merges with the 1st type cds ) and the narrower si  depletion region seems to reside around the outer boundary of the 1st type cds .",
    "the radial distribution of the mass ratio sic / c has a sharp peak in the region just ahead of the outer boundary of 1st type cds , and decrease by 0.1 ( 10@xmath189 ) toward the outer boundary of precedent 2nd ( 1st ) type cds ( see the bottom row ) .",
    "the peak value exceeds ten in the inner circumstellar envelope , and decreases with increasing @xmath119 because of the subsequent growth of carbon grains .",

    "80 % of sic grains by mass populate in the radii between 0.2 and 1.0 @xmath12 : the distribution well covers the size range of presolar sic grains found in the murchison meteorite . thus the hydrodynamical model with the non  lte case for the formation of sic grains that the vibration temperature of sic cluster is assumed to be the same as the temperature of small sic grains reasonably reproduces the amount of sic grains inferred from astronomical observations and the size of presolar sic grains extracted from the murchison meteorite .",

    "the nucleation process starting from the two  body reaction of si@xmath29c@xmath29 molecules dominates the nucleation rate in the region around 68 @xmath150 whose gas temperature ranges from 600 to 800 k. however the gas density in the region of @xmath19110@xmath192 g @xmath25 is too low to increase the amount of sic grains ; even if this process is included in the calculation , the resulting values of both @xmath162 and sic / c are limited to 10@xmath189 although the nucleation rate is much larger than that starting from sic molecule .",
    "in addition , this nucleation process produces the population of grains whose radii are much smaller than 6.0 @xmath18 10@xmath172 @xmath12 , and make the modal radius smaller than 3.0 @xmath18 10@xmath172 @xmath12 .",
    "thus the nucleation process starting from two  body reaction of si@xmath29c@xmath29 molecules does not change the conclusion that the hydrodynamical models with the lte  case can not reproduce the amount of sic grains around c  rich agb stars inferred from the astronomical observation and the size range derived from the analysis of presolar grains .    in the non  lte case , this nucleation process dominates the formation of sic grains in the region of @xmath1744 @xmath150 , and is activated particularly in the outer part of the carbon dust shell .",
    "although the number of sic grains produced through this process reaches about 10 times that produced through the nucleation starting from sic molecule , the typical radius of sic grains formed in the region with low gas density is limited to 3@xmath1810@xmath1686@xmath1810@xmath193 .",

    "the formation of sic grains around c  rich agb stars is investigated for the first time in the framework of hydrodynamical model for the pulsation  enhanced dust  driven wind .",
    "we formulate the nucleation and growth processes of sic grains , considering that sic grains nucleate and grow homogeneously starting from sic molecule . in the calculations ,",
    "the two cases are considered for the nucleation process of sic grains ; the lte case in which the vibration temperature @xmath0 of sic cluster is equal to the gas temperature and the non  lte case in which @xmath0 is assumed to be the same as the temperature of small sic grain whose radius is 10@xmath168 @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the vibration temperature of carbon cluster is considered to be the same as the gas temperature as is usually assumed in the hydrodynamical models for c  rich agb stars .",
    "the results of calculations for the model parameters @xmath1=1.0 @xmath2 , @xmath3=10@xmath4 @xmath5 , @xmath6=2600 k , c / o ratio=1.4 , @xmath7=650 days , and @xmath149=2.0 km s@xmath17 are summarized as follows : in the lte case , sic grains form in the accelerated and low  density outflowing gas after the formation of carbon grains .",
    "the resulting time averaged number fraction of si atoms locked into sic grains ( condensation efficiency @xmath162 ) of at most 10@xmath9 is too small to reproduce the amount of sic grains inferred from the astronomical observations and the radius is limited to less than 0.1 @xmath12 . on the other hand , in the non  lte case , the time averaged mass ratio of sic to carbon grains ranges from 0.098 to 0.23 for the sticking probability @xmath10=0.11.0 , which is not in conflict with the value of 0.010.3 inferred from the radiative transfer models .",
    "the time averaged size distribution of sic grains by mass with the peak at radius of 0.20.3 @xmath12 well covers the size range of presolar sic grains extracted from the murchison meteorite .",
    "thus we conclude that the so called inverse greenhouse effect plays a crucial role in the formation process of sic grains in the pulsation  enhanced dust  driven winds from c  rich agb stars , apart from the validity of the underlying assumption made in the non  lte case .",
    "the non  lte effect should be explored for the formation process of dust grains in astrophysical environments .",
    "the hydrodynamical model provides the two types of carbon dust shells ; the 1st ( 2nd ) type cds with the peak value of @xmath1640.9 ( 0.3 @xmath167 0.7 ) .",
    "the formation region and the resulting radial distribution of sic grains in the hydrodynamical model with non  lte case is closely related with the formation and dynamics of carbon dust shell , especially through the density enhancement and the backwarming effect . in the inner circumstellar envelope , the sic dust shell can be discriminated from the 1st type cds through the extended si ",
    "depletion region caused by the 2nd cds formed in the outer part of active sic formation region .",
    "however , in the outer circumstellar envelope of @xmath17420 @xmath150 , the sic dust shell is localized around the outer boundary of 1st type cds .",
    "not only the formation region and the radial distribution but also the amount and the size distribution of sic grains could heavily depend on the c / o ratio as well as the other model parameters ; for instance , in the non  lte case with @xmath1=2.0 @xmath2 , the mass ratio of sic to gas and the size of sic are almost the same as those with @xmath1=1.0 @xmath2 while the mass loss rate decreases by a factor 5 .",
    "anyway more comprehensive study covering a wide range of model parameters is necessary for revealing the amount and the size distribution of sic grains formed around c  rich agb stars . also , the difference between the radial distributions of carbon and sic grains could greatly influence the appearance of the spectral feature attributed to sic grains .",
    "these aspects will be investigated in the forthcoming papers .",
