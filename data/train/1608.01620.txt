    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is that the disordered lattice networks fail to capture important structural features of real networks at the scale of the cell , such as the random positions of the vertices .    to generate a model network that better matches the structural features of the experimental networks , we begin by distributing vertices randomly throughout a volume .",

    "we briefly review how the overall connectivity of a network affects its macroscopic mechanical properties ( 20 , 22 ) .    for high values of @xmath21 , the bulk elastic moduli of fiber networks",
    "are dominated by the stretching of fibers .",
    "as @xmath21 is lowered , the macroscopic response eventually undergoes a crossover from a stretching - dominated to a bending - dominated response , as the network can be deformed without stretching fibers but not without bending them .",
    "as @xmath21 is further lowered , another elastic transition occurs when the network ultimately loses macroscopic rigidity . over the whole range ,",
    "the macroscopic response depends strongly and nonlinearly on the network connectivity , with the strongest dependence near the two elastic transitions .",
    "we expect this sensitivity of the macroscopic stiffness to overall network connectivity to be reflected in a corresponding sensitive dependence of local stiffness on local network connectivity .    to determine how the rapid scaling of the macroscopic response with connectivity manifests locally , we varied the average coordination number @xmath21 of modeled networks for a fixed ratio of the bending modulus @xmath3 to the stretching modulus @xmath2 ( with @xmath37 , fig .",

    "s2__c _ _ ) . at high connectivities ,",
    "the entire local stiffness response is dominated by stretching interactions and scales with the stretching modulus @xmath2 . as the connectivity is lowered , the entire local stiffness distribution shifts to lower values .",
    "specifically , the median stiffness decreases rapidly and nonlinearly with the average coordination @xmath21 . near the stretching - bending crossover",
    ", the local stiffness distribution becomes bimodal with the emergence of a subset of probes for which the measured stiffness scales with the bending modulus @xmath3 .",
    "below the stretching - bending crossover , the number of stretch - dominated probes becomes negligible , and the local stiffness response enters a bending - dominated regime . within this regime ,",
    "the median stiffness resumes rapid decay .",
    "finally , as the connectivity is brought below the rigidity transition , an increasing fraction of measurements yields zero stiffness as portions of the network become floppy .",
    "we thus find that the elastic transitions of the macroscopic response manifest locally as crossovers between stretch - dominated , bending - dominated , and zero - stiffness measurements . at these crossovers , the median",
    "stiffness decreases most rapidly , and the local stiffness distribution becomes bimodal , yielding a maximum in the geometric standard deviation .",
    "the low connectivity of the experimental collagen and fibrin networks suggests that they are situated in the bending - dominated regime . at these particular connectivities ,",
    "the rgg network is poised approximately halfway between the elastic transitions . here , the median stiffness scales least rapidly , and we therefore expect the proximity to the transitions to play a minimal role in governing the width of the rgg stiffness distribution . to verify this , we systematically varied the ratio of the bending modulus to the stretching modulus for these rgg networks ( fig .",
    "s1__b__,_d _ ) .",
    "we found that the local stiffness measured by each individual probe is nonzero and scales with the bending modulus .",
    "this implies that the experimental networks are far from both elastic crossovers , implicating a different source for the broad local stiffness distributions .",
    "a very broad distribution of local stiffnesses appears to be a generic feature of disordered fiber networks .",
    "what is the origin of this large variance in local stiffness measurements ? to investigate how a local stiffness measurement depends on the surrounding network structure , we calculated the stiffness loss @xmath38 upon removing a single fiber ( _ supporting information _ ) .",
    "intuitively , removal of fibers that are more proximal to the stiffness probe should have a greater effect on @xmath6 , which suggests that on average , the stiffness loss should decay as a function of the distance @xmath9 from the probe center to the center of the removed fiber .",
    "indeed , for all types of networks we studied , we found that the average stiffness loss is consistent with @xmath39 decay ( fig .",
    "1__c__,_d _ , fig . s1__f _ _ , and fig",
    ". s2__b _ _ , _ insets _ ) .",
    "this apparent universality of the scaling of the stiffness loss suggests that the @xmath39 power - law decay should be calculable within continuum elasticity theory .",
    "we therefore calculated the effect of removing a single fiber in the vicinity of a local stiffness probe for the case of a uniform lattice network ( _ supporting information _ ) .",
    "the defect created by removing a fiber at a distance @xmath9 from the probe perturbs the dipole strain field induced by the probe .",
    "we can treat this perturbation as an additional dipole strain field originating from the defect , with a magnitude proportional to the initial strain in the removed fiber .",
    "since both this initial strain , and the consequent additional strain `` reflected '' back to the probe , decay as the strain field of a force - dipole , i.e. as @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the dimension ) , the combined effect is an increase in the strain at the location of the probe @xmath42 .",
    "the rapid @xmath39 decay of the stiffness loss due to fiber removal in three dimensions suggests that the local stiffness is largely determined by the network structure in the immediate vicinity of the probe . within this small local region ,",
    "all quantities are subject to large fluctuations ; for example , since a small region typically contains a small number of fibers , the variance of fiber density will be large .",
    "the universal , rapid @xmath28 decay implies that the mechanically relevant local structure will always be _ very _ local , with consequently large fluctuations .    to quantify the dependence of local stiffness on the surrounding network structure , we considered the number of local fibers @xmath43 , defined as the sum of fibers each weighted by a @xmath39-decaying function of its distance @xmath9 from the probe center ( see above and _ supporting information _ ) .",
    "we find that @xmath6 and @xmath25 are well correlated for all types of networks studied , as shown in fig .",
    "2__b__,_c_. importantly , @xmath6 has a strong , nonlinear dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "specifically , the center of the marginal distribution of local stiffnesses at fixed @xmath25 increases more rapidly than linearly with @xmath25 .",
    "this indicates that local fibers influence local stiffness in a highly cooperative manner , i.e. combining multiple fibers typically results in much larger than additive changes to local stiffness .    to estimate the geometric standard deviation of local stiffness ,",
    "we must account for these cooperative effects among fibers .",
    "we first note that the scaling of the _ median _ local stiffness with @xmath25 is consistent with that of the macroscopic shear modulus for all types of networks we studied ( fig .",
    ", s5__d__-_f _ , _ insets _ ) .",
    "this suggests that much of the broad width of the stiffness distribution can be accounted for by the large variations in the local fiber density taken together with the strong , nonlinear dependence of the macroscopic shear modulus on overall fiber density . to test this notion ,",
    "we estimated the distribution of local stiffnesses by taking @xmath25 transformed by the functional dependence of the macroscopic shear modulus , @xmath44 , where the modulus @xmath45 is that of a macroscopic network with an average number of local fibers given by @xmath46 . upon accounting for the strong collective effects of fiber density in this manner , we found that the geometric standard deviation of @xmath44 provides a very good estimate for the actual , observed geometric standard deviation of local stiffness ( fig .",

    "consequently , the estimator correctly predicts the relative differences in the geometric standard deviation for the different types of networks , including the observation that the stiffness distributions for the experimental and rgg networks are much broader than for the disordered lattice networks .",
    "our prediction of the width of stiffness distributions is not sensitive to the particular form of the weighting function , provided the decay is rapid enough .",
    "for instance , a hard cutoff at twice the mesh size captures a majority of the broad width for the fcc network ( fig .",
    "s4__e _ _ ) .",
    "however , a less rapidly decaying estimator includes a larger number of fibers in the local structure , and consequently the variance in fiber density is smaller .",
    "thus , by comparison , an estimator with weights that decay as @xmath47 yields a smaller , much poorer estimate of the width of the stiffness distribution ( fig .",

    "above , we demonstrated how local structure impacts local stiffness for a fixed distance between probed vertices .",
    "biologically , this distance corresponds to the scale over which cells measure stiffness .",
    "since cells can adopt various sizes and shapes , this means that a cell might measure on different scales depending on the length of its `` arms , '' i.e. the distance between focal adhesions .",
    "we therefore consider the local stiffness as a function of the length of the force - dipole probe in our model .    for long probes , the geometric mean and geometric standard deviation of stiffness approach constant values ( fig .",
    "3__a__,_b _ ) .",
    "this asymptotic saturation occurs because for very long probes , the measured deformation is simply the sum of the deformations of two independent _ monopole _ probes , namely the deformation at a vertex in response to a force applied at that vertex . as the probe length",
    "is decreased , however , the measured stiffness increases by more than a decade before the probe length reaches the average mesh size , which is a much larger increase than predicted by continuum theory ( _ supporting information _ ) .",
    "surprisingly , the measured stiffening deviates noticeably from the continuum prediction even for probe lengths that are several times larger than the mesh size .    for the experimental and rgg networks , this anomalously large fold - stiffening",
    "is present for all values of @xmath21 and larger near the elastic transitions ( fig .",
    "s8 ) . in contrast , for the fcc network , the stiffness distribution has almost no dependence on probe length away from the elastic transitions ( fig .",
    "s7__d _ _ ) .",
    "this implies that the dramatic fold - stiffening of the experimental and rgg networks largely results from intrinsic features of these networks that are not present for the fcc network .",
    "one relevant feature that distinguishes the different types of networks is the distribution of fiber lengths .",
    "that is , the experimental and rgg networks both contain long fibers connecting vertices several times more distant than the mesh size , whereas for the fcc networks , the typical fiber length ( given by the number of consecutive , coaxial bonds uninterrupted by non - coaxial crosslinking bonds ) is equal to the mesh size , i.e. the lattice spacing . indeed , a simple extension of continuum elasticity that includes structural heterogeneity on the scale of the fiber length can quantitatively capture the majority of the large fold - stiffening observed for the experimental and rgg networks ( _ supporting information _ ) .",
    "thus , our results indicate that the polydispersity of fiber length in biopolymer networks can increase the fold - stiffening as a function of probe length .",

    "error bars show geometric standard deviation of local stiffness ; solid curves ( blue ) from continuum theory ( _ supporting information _ ) . ]",
    "the intrinsic heterogeneity of fiber networks presents a challenge for cells attempting to glean information from stiffness cues .",
    "that is , tissues with different _ global _ stiffness properties may have significant overlap of their _ local _ stiffness distributions . in this case , a single local stiffness measurement would provide only a poor estimate of the global stiffness and identity of the tissue . in view of our conclusion that local stiffness distributions are generically broad ,",
    "how accurately can cells infer the global stiffness of their surroundings from samples of local stiffness ?",
    "one possible strategy for cells to increase their inference accuracy is by averaging multiple stiffness measurements . with enough samples of local stiffness",

    "these spatial correlations of local stiffness arise because nearby stiffness measurements depend on shared local structure . since correlations reduce the effective number of independent samples , we expect less accurate global inference if stiffness measurements are made closer together in space .    to quantitatively study the reduction in accuracy of cellular mechanosensing due to spatial correlations , we modeled cell inference as an idealized sampling and averaging . to be concrete , we considered the sampled stiffness to be the geometric mean of a random sample of three probes whose centers are contained within prolate spheroids of varying volume and aspect ratio ( fig .",

    ", we asked how this intrinsic heterogeneity impacts mechanosensing .",
    "interestingly , we found that within macroscopically homogeneous but locally disordered collagen and fibrin networks , local probes yield a very broad range of stiffnesses , spanning roughly two decades ( similar to the relative difference in the bulk stiffness of brain and bone ) .",
    "moreover , the average measured stiffness is anomalously sensitive to probe length .",
    "we quantitatively captured these striking features of the experimental networks with modeled networks , which enabled us to elucidate their physical origins using a combination of simulations and scaling arguments .",
    "we first established that the very broad range of local stiffnesses is universal across network types and spans a wide range of connectivities , including multiple elastic regimes .",
    "we then traced the origin of this pervasive broad distribution to variations in local structure .",
    "specifically , stiffness probes are primarily sensitive to a very small region of local fibers , and these privileged fibers contribute to the measured response in a highly cooperative fashion .",
    "finally , we found that the distribution of stiffnesses can be further broadened by tuning specific network features , including proximity to elastic transitions and geometrical disorder .",

    "explain why the range of stiffnesses is larger for the experimental and random geometric graph ( rgg ) networks than for lattice - based networks .",
    "the geometrical disorder of the experimental and rgg networks also introduces an anomalous fold - stiffening , i.e. a dependence of stiffness on probe length that exceeds that predicted by continuum elasticity .",
    "our `` ideal - mechanosensor '' model does not address the internal mechanics of cells .",
    "any internal noise in sensing or downstream signaling can only increase overall measurement uncertainty .",
    "there is evidence that cells can fix and thus regulate the relative uncertainty in measured stiffness by linearly modulating their applied stress to maintain a constant deformation ( 8) . notwithstanding , we have shown that even if cells sense nearly optimally , any single stiffness measurement is poorly informative of global tissue properties .",
    "this suggests that cells can benefit more from integrating the results of multiple stiffness measurements than from optimizing individual measurements , which may explain why some cells display more than a hundred focal adhesions ( 33 ) . yet",
    "even this strategy has diminishing returns , because nearby stiffness measurements probe the same underlying local structure and are therefore correlated . to extract useful information",
    ", cells must spread their measurements over extended regions of space , either by moving or by extending their shape .",
    "the benefits of an elongated shape are twofold , since measurements on larger scales are both more accurate and less spatially correlated .",
    "the biological relevance of this strategy is supported by the observation of highly polarized cells over five times longer than wide , including fibroblasts , mesenchymal stem cells , and cancer cells ( 5 , 13 , 33 , 34 ) .",
    "since cells and the ecm evolved together , the latter may also be tuned to facilitate mechanical inference .",
    "we uncovered two design principles for tuning the mechanical response : proximity to an elastic transition and the presence of long fibers .",
    "both features result in an enhanced fold - stiffening for shorter probes , which may be harnessed to provide specialized signals to different cell types that measure over different scales , albeit the fold - stiffening comes at the cost of increased variance of the local stiffness . with regard to this variance , while we have only considered isotropic networks , actual tissues can have aligned fibers ( 12 ) , which may yield a narrower stiffness distribution when probed along a fixed direction .",
    "this may explain why the alignment of the ecm has been observed to coordinate with cell polarization to promote migration ( 35 ) .",
    "+ finally , probing stiffness beyond linear response could provide cells with additional information .",
    "how hard would a cell need to pull to access the nonlinear regime ?",

    "we compute the local stiffness distribution numerically using the procedure described above in section 1.3 ; however , rather than considering an ensemble of individual probes over many network realizations , we sample many probes throughout the volume of a single network .",
    "these procedures are equivalent when the sample volumes are large compared to the scale over which local stiffness measurements are correlated , i.e. networks which are large enough to represent the ensemble via self - averaging .",

    "here , we provide the first numerical analysis of the microscopic response of three - dimensional disordered lattice networks and demonstrate that such models fail to quantitatively capture the broad width we observed for the experimental collagen and fibrin networks .",

    "this suggests that the broad width we observed for all types of networks we studied arises from intrinsic features common to all types of disordered networks .",
    "indeed , as we observed for the rgg network ( see _ results _ ) , we found that for the disordered lattice networks : ( 1 ) the stiffness loss also obeys universal scaling ( see fig .",
    "s2__b _ _ , _ inset _ for fcc lattice results ) , and ( 2 ) the scaling of the marginal distribution of local stiffnesses with the number of local fibers @xmath25 is captured by the rapid , nonlinear scaling of the macroscopic shear modulus ( fig .",
    "s4__d__-_f _ , _ insets _ ) .",
    "we then estimated the geometric standard deviation for the sc and fcc networks in the same way as for the experimental and rgg networks ( see next section , _ dependence of local stiffness on local structure _ ) .",
    "as before , we estimate the local stiffness distribution as the distribution of the number of local fibers @xmath25 transformed by the macroscopic shear modulus . for both sc and fcc lattice networks , we found that counting the number of local fibers using rapidly - decaying weighting functions results in a good match between the estimated and actual geometric standard deviations ( table s1 , fig .",
    "s4__d__-_f _ ) .",
    "furthermore , we found that the estimate does not depend significantly on the particular form of the weighting function used to calculate the number of local fibers .",
    "specifically , the estimate of the geometric standard deviation for the fcc network does not depend strongly on whether we chose a rapidly decaying power - law or a hard cutoff at two mesh sizes ( fig .",
    "s4__d__,_e _ ) .",
    "this suggests that obtaining a good estimate of the geometric standard deviation based on local structure does not require finely - tuning the details of the weighting function , provided the chosen weights are given by a function that decays sufficiently rapidly with distance .",
    "to gain insight into the variation of local stiffness , we determined how the presence of a single fiber in the vicinity of the stiffness probe impacts the local stiffness .",
    "we quantified the influence of a fiber by the stiffness loss @xmath38 , defined as the relative change in local stiffness upon removing the fiber from the network ( fig .",
    "intuitively , fibers which are more proximal should have a greater effect .",

    "we calculate how the stiffness loss scales with distance @xmath9 for an ordered lattice .",
    "we calculate the stiffness loss scaling by first deriving an exact formula for the change in local stiffness when a single fiber is removed from an ordered , stretching - only network in @xmath41 dimensions , and then studying how the magnitude of the effect depends on the distance to the missing fiber from the center of the probe .",
