    "helioseismology data analysis pipelines are planned for near real - time analyses of the observations in order to provide the analysis results to the helioseismology and solar physics communities . the time ",
    "distance analysis pipeline is one of the pipelines for local helioseismology studies , and other pipelines include ring  diagram analysis and farside active region imaging .",
    "the time  distance pipeline is designed for routine production of nearly full - disk subsurface wave - speed perturbations and horizontal flow fields every eight hours , as well as synoptic flow maps for every carrington rotation .",
    "it can also be used to analyze specific target areas and time periods .",
    "time  distance helioseismology was first introduced by duvall _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 , 1996 ) , and it has developed rapidly since then .",
    "different inversion techniques were introduced and tested .",
    "the lsqr algorithm , introduced by and used later by , solves the inversion problem in a least - squares sense in the spatial domain by an iterative approach .",
    "the multi - channel deconvolution ( mcd ) method , introduced by and widely used in later studies ( _ e.g. _  ) , solves the least - squares problems in the fourier domain .",
    "later , applied a horizontal regularization procedure for this inversion technique .",
    "more recently , an optimally localized averaging ( ola ) inversion scheme was introduced to study the solar subsurface flow fields @xcite .",
    "different types of sensitivity kernels , which describe the relationship between the travel times and interior properties , were also introduced and used in the time - distance inversion problems .",
    "first used ray - path approximation kernels , introduced fresnel - zone kernels ; and , , and investigated born - approximation kernels for both sound - speed structures and flow fields . compared subsurface sound - speed perturbation structures inferred from these different types of kernels , and found that the inversion results obtained with the different kernels were basically consistent .",
    "important results on the solar interior properties have been obtained from the time  distance studies as well as from other local helioseismology techniques . on global scales , poleward meridional flows were found below the photosphere @xcite , and solar - cycle dependent meridional flow variations were also investigated and discussed @xcite . on local scales , subsurface sound - speed perturbations and flow fields were derived for supergranulation @xcite and for sunspots @xcite . additionally , time - distance helioseismology was used to detect the emergence of active regions before their appearances in the photosphere @xcite , to image large active regions on the farside of the sun @xcite , and to measure sound - speed perturbations in the tachocline @xcite .",
    "these results are important for space - weather forecasting and understanding the mechanisms for the generation of solar magnetism . the time ",
    "distance helioseismology pipeline analyses , based on the high spatial - resolution and high temporal - cadence observations from hmi , will greatly advance our knowledge of the interior processes and their connections with solar activity above the photosphere .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the physics of solar oscillations in the turbulent magnetized plasma is very complicated , and that the helioseismic techniques are still in the process of being developed .",
    "because of limited knowledge of the wave physics and complexity of the mhd turbulence , there may be systematic uncertainties in the local helioseismology inferences , particularly in strong magnetic - field regions of sunspots .",
    "for example , lindsey and braun ( 2005a , 2005b ) argued that the outgoing and ingoing travel time asymmetries observed in sunspot areas might be caused by a  shower - glass effect \" .",
    "found that the inclined magnetic field in sunspot penumbrae might cause variations of measured acoustic travel times . found that this inclined magnetic field dependent effect",
    "does not exist in the measurements obtained from the mdi intensity observations .",
    "later , found that the non - uniform acoustic power distribution in the photosphere also contributed to measured travel - time shifts in active regions if a phase - speed filtering procedure was applied .",
    "this effect was then studied by and numerically , and also by analytically .",
    "more recently , derived a sunspot s subsurface flow fields after applying ridge filtering , and their inferred results did not agree with the previously inverted results with a use of phase - speed filtering . using high spatial - resolution observations from _ hinode _ , showed that the principal results on sunspot structure did not depend on the use of phase - speed filtering .",
    "however , significant systematic uncertainties in sunspot seismology remain and need to be understood , and these are being actively studied by the use of numerical simulations . for a recent review of the sunspot seismology and uncertainties see .    despite the ongoing discussions of accuracy of time  distance measurements and interpretation of inversion results , it is useful to provide the measured travel times and the inversion results for investigations of structures and flows below the visible surface of the sun .",
    "as the flow chart of the pipeline in figure  [ flow_chart ] shows , we apply phase - speed filtering to the hmi data , compute cross - covariances of the oscillations , and use two different travel - time fitting procedures to derive the acoustic travel times .",
    "we then perform inversions using two different sets of travel - time sensitivity kernels , based on the ray - path and born approximations , to infer subsurface wave - speed perturbations and flow fields , using the mcd inversion method .",
    "we provide online access to the measured travel times , full - disk subsurface wave - speed perturbations and flow maps calculated every eight hours .",
    "in addition , we provide synoptic flow maps for each carrington rotation . in this article , we describe details of the acoustic travel time measurement procedure in section  [ s2 ] , and the inversion procedure in section  [ s3 ] .",
    "we describe the pipeline data products and present initial hmi results in section  [ s4 ] , and summarize our work in section  [ s5 ] .",
    "the sdo / hmi continuously observes the full - disk sun , providing doppler velocity , continuum intensity , line - depth , line - width , and magnetic field maps with a 45-second cadence , and also vector magnetic field measurements with a cadence of 12 minutes .",

    "the doppler observations are primarily used for helioseismic studies .",
    "the observing sequences , algorithms for deriving doppler velocity and magnetic field , and other instrument calibration issues are discussed by .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ flow_chart ] , the primary input for the pipeline is dopplergrams , although in principle , the hmi intensitygrams and line - depth data can also be analyzed in the same manner .",
    "users of the pipeline can select specific areas for analysis , preferably within @xmath2 from the solar disk center . in practice ,",
    "the users provide the carrington longitude and latitude of the center of the selected area , and the mid - time of the selected time period , then the pipeline code selects an area of roughly @xmath3 centered at the given coordinate , and for a time interval of eight hours with the given time as the middle point . the data for this selected area and the time period are then tracked to remove solar rotation , and remapped into the heliographic coordinates using postel s projection ( also known as azimuthal equidistant projection ) relative to the given area center . normally , the tracked area consists of @xmath4 pixels with a spatial sampling of @xmath5 pixel@xmath1 ; and the temporal sampling is the same as the observational cadence .",
