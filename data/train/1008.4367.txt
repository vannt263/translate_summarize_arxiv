    "although there have been many theoretical and observational advances in understanding cosmic - ray acceleration by supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks over the last decade , it is still not yet clear whether snrs are capable of putting more than 5% of their energy into cosmic rays .",
    "this number is necessary in order to explain the cosmic - ray energy density in the galaxy , given the size of the galaxy , the supernova rate , and the cosmic - ray escape time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for an early discussion ) .",
    "the theoretical advances consist , among others , of a better understanding of magnetic field amplification by cosmic - ray streaming ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and major improvements in the self - consistent modeling of efficient cosmic - ray acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these simulations show that snr shocks can transfer up to @xmath1% of the kinetic energy flux entering the shock to cosmic rays",
    ".    on the observational side progress has been made through x - ray observations which show that many young snrs are actively accelerating electrons up to 10 - 100 tev , and they show that the magnetic fields must indeed be amplified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "another major source of progress has been the coming of age of tev gamma - ray astronomy .",

    "this proves that snrs are capable of accelerating particles up to at least 100  tev .",
    "unfortunately , a correct interpretation of the emission mechanism , i.e. pion - decay or inverse compton scattering , is necessary for understanding the fraction of energy contained by accelerated particles ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "recent gev gamma - ray observations with the fermi - lat even show that , whatever the emission mechanism , a bright young snr like cassiopeia a ( cas a ) has only transferred @xmath2% of its explosion energy to accelerated particles .",
    "the interpretation is not yet clear : are cas a and other young snrs beyond their peak in acceleration power , and did most of the highest energy particles escape ? or did they not yet reach their full potential as sources of cosmic rays ? or are young snrs not the dominant sources of galactic cosmic rays ?",
    "recently , another method of measuring cosmic - ray acceleration efficiency has drawn attention .",
    "it consists of measuring the proton temperature behind snr shocks that are suspected of being efficient cosmic - ray accelerators , in view of their high velocity or multi - wavelength properties . without cosmic - ray acceleration",
    "there exists a simple relationship between the post - shock plasma temperature and shock velocity .",
    "however , when a shock accelerates cosmic rays , less energy is available for plasma heating .",
    "the proton temperature can be deduced from thermal doppler broadening of h@xmath3 line emission from behind fast shocks @xcite .",
    "note that , unlike the electron temperature , the proton temperature is for cosmic abundance close to or equal to the mean plasma temperature .",
    "this method was used by @xcite for an x - ray synchrotron emitting shock in the snr rcw 86 .",
    "the x - ray synchrotron emission indicates that the shock is actively accelerating particles to @xmath4 tev energies .",
    "moreover , rcw 86 is detected by h.e.s.s . as a tev gamma - ray source @xcite .",
    "indeed @xcite found that the plasma temperature is a factor of at least three lower than expected given the measured shock velocity .",
    "however , this value could not be directly translated into a fractional cosmic - ray pressure behind the shock , but was translated into a lower limit of fractional cosmic - ray pressure of @xmath5% .",

    "we explore the rankine - hugoniot relations for a two - fluid shock further .",
    "we show that for a given fractional cosmic - ray pressure @xmath6 , there is a unique cosmic - ray energy escape flux , @xmath7 , associated with it that only depends on the overall mach number of the shock .    in the next section we present the derivation of the relation between @xmath8 , @xmath9 and post - shock plasma temperature . in sect .  [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss this relation and its limitations in the context of two - fluid models , and cosmic - ray acceleration models , and we use the relations to derive the cosmic - ray pressure content for the northeastern region of rcw 86 and for the newly measured plasma temperature of the young large magellanic cloud snr 0509 - 67.5 @xcite .",

    "in addition we introduce the compression ratios across the different regions 0,1 , and 2 : @xmath18    we now use the assumption that the thermal pressure in the precursor is only due to adiabatic heating in the precursor , i.e. @xmath19 ( c.f . * ? ? ?",

    "the cosmic - ray terms therefore cancel each other in equation  ( [ eq : momentum ] ) , when considering the momentum flux from region 1 to 2 . in other words",

    "* ) : @xmath32 with @xmath33 the internal energy , and @xmath34 the escaping cosmic - ray energy flux , normalized to the total kinetic energy flux of the shock .",

    "following @xcite we introduce for convenience @xmath37 reordering the terms and using equation  ( [ eq : p2 ] ) gives : @xmath38 this equation completes the thermodynamic relation between the precursor compression ratio @xmath39 and downstream non - thermal pressure and overall energy flux escape .",

    "there is a critical mach number , @xmath44 below which cosmic - ray acceleration can not be thermodynamically supported for @xmath0 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : epsilon ] . for @xmath40 ( figure  [ fig : epsilon2 ] )",
    "cosmic - ray acceleration can be supported for lower mach numbers , but there is still a limit , since @xmath45 for @xmath46 .    to summarize : taking @xmath39 as the principal variable , and @xmath15 as an input parameter , one can calculate the subshock mach number @xmath31 ( equation  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) ) , from which the subshock compression ratio follows ( equation  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) , and therewith the overall compression ratio @xmath47 .",
    "this can then be used to calculate @xmath8 ( equation  ( [ eq : w ] ) ) and @xmath9 ( equation  ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) ) .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : epsilon ] .      note that although for a given @xmath8 the escape flux @xmath9 can be calculated , the opposite is not true .",
    "the reason is that @xmath9 has a maximum .",
    "in fact , mathematically the curves beyond the maximum declines further then indicated in figure  [ fig : epsilon ] ( left ) , but this would correspond to an unphysical compression factor of @xmath48 at the subshock",

    "it is useful to define the ratio , @xmath63 between the downstream temperature in the presence of cosmic - ray acceleration and the expected temperature for a pure gas shock , as this is a quantity that can be related to existing measurements ( c.f .",

    "in addition we show in figure  [ fig : mach2 ] the downstream mach number @xmath69 .",
    "this shows that for high @xmath8 the dowstream mach number rapidly approaches @xmath70 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "i.e. a continuous shock , we have @xmath70 , which leads to an unstable situation , as was already established by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there is now observational evidence for magnetic field amplification by shocks in young snrs . in our two - fluid approach",
    "we ignore the effects of magnetic fields on the flow parameters , although we hope to come to this issue in the near future .",
    "for now we offer an assessment of the magnitude of magnetic amplification on the cosmic - ray dominated shocks .",
    "we start by noting that the downstream magnetic field in several young snrs is consistent with @xmath72  % @xcite .",
    "the question now is , what is the perpendicular magnetic field pressure on the subshock compared to the ram pressure , i.e. what is @xmath73 ) ?",
    "this can be calculated using the fact that @xmath74 : @xmath75 since @xmath76 we can say that observations of young snrs indicate that @xmath77 from figure  [ fig : epsilon ] ( right ) we can see that for a large range of @xmath8 the factor @xmath78 is smaller than one . around the maximum of @xmath52 we have @xmath79 .",
    "so in order to have @xmath80% one needs @xmath81 , which is larger than for any of the models depicted in figure  [ fig : epsilon ] .",
    "however , there has been a debate whether @xmath82 @xcite , or @xmath83 @xcite . for",
    "the young snrs the precise proportionality does not change our conclusion very much , but in very young snrs and/or for radio supernovae this may be relevant",
    ". in particular for sn 1993j , which was bright radio supernova , magnetic fields as high as 50  g have been inferred , and @xmath84 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "at such a level the magnetic fields may start to become dynamically important .",
    "apart from amplifying the magnetic field upstream of the shock , cosmic rays in the precursor may also give rise to non - adiabatic gas heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of non - adiabatic heating will be similar to having a lower mach number shock , i.e. non - adiabatic heating in the precursor limits the maximum overall compression ratio and limits the maximum possible fractional cosmic - ray pressure in the downstream region .",
    "the entropy jump across a shock is given by the relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath85 this neglects the entropy increase associated with the accelerated particles .",
    "@xcite calculated the entropy of non - thermal distributions , which , not surprisingly , always have entropy values below a thermal distribution . moreover ,",
    "they normalize the distribution to the number of particles involved .",
    "however , in reality the cosmic - ray component may contribute a dominant fraction of the pressure , but the number of particles is always much smaller than the number of thermal particles .",
    "so neglecting the entropy of the cosmic rays is a good approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig : entropy ] ( left ) shows that , when the fractional cosmic - ray pressure @xmath8 increases , the jump in entropy decreases . the right hand panel is more interesting as it shows that for certain values of the escaping energy flux @xmath9 there are two possibilities for the jump in entropy .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath9 as a function of entropy change @xmath86 again occurs for the value for which @xmath52 has a maximum .",
    "one can speculate that whenever there are possible solutions to obtain a certain value for @xmath9 the nature chooses the one that offers the highest entropy jump .",
    "on the other hand the escape has to be facilitated by the details of the acceleration process and particle spectrum , so one should not discount the low entropy branch too easily .",
    "the solutions that we presented here for the two - fluid approach to shock with a cosmic - ray component give us a handle on estimating the effects of cosmic - ray acceleration on the post - shock plasma temperature , and in addition allow us to estimate the cosmic - ray escape .",
    "it may not be too surprising that there is a thermodynamic relation between fractional cosmic - ray pressure @xmath8 and escape .",
    "the reason is that in order to have a shock jump one needs either viscous shock , or one needs to lose energy from the system .",
    "the problem with a cosmic - ray component is that the accelerated particles do not cause a jump in entropy .",
    "therefore , the increased overall shock compression has to be facilitated by energy escape .",
    "this situation will change once additional heating in the precursor caused by cosmic - ray heating is introduced .",
    "this heating is presumably the result of dissipation of large - amplitude magnetohydrodynamic waves in the cosmic - ray precursor ( alfvnic heating ) ; these waves are the result of cosmic - ray streaming @xcite .",
    "the most important effect of heating in the precursor will be that the mach number at the subshock @xmath31 will be decreased .",
    "so we expect that including precursor heating will resemble the solutions for lower mach number shocks",
    ". however , the physical details of cosmic - ray heating are not well known , and an in depth study of cosmic - ray heating is beyond the scope of this paper . note that in principal additional heating can be incorporated in the equations , by parameterizing it in relation to the upstream mach number and @xmath8 .",
    "another limitation of the two - fluid approach is that it assumes a steady state situation and a plane parallel geometry . in a non - steady state situation",
    "the shock relations may be influenced by shock acceleration in the past @xcite .",
    "energy flux conservation ( equation  [ eq : energy ] ) may therefore be violated .",
    "moreover , the highest energy particles may take such a long time between two consecutive shock crossings that the shock velocity has appreciably slowed down .",
    "an early discussion of time dependent effects , as well as the influence of spherical expansion , can be found in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "recently non - steady situations were investigated by @xcite , using a kinetic approach , and @xcite , using monte - carlo simulations of test particles coupled to hydrodynamic simulations of spherically expanding snrs .    in non - steady situations high compression ratios can be reached , even in the absence of escape of cosmic rays from the system , because in the precursor there is a larger energy flux associated with particles diffusing in the upstream direction than in the downstream direction . in a steady state situation",
    ", this asymmetry is caused by escape of the highest energy particles . in a non - steady state situation ,",
    "in which the cosmic - ray particle population is building up @xcite , this asymmetry is caused by the fact that the flow in the upstream direction is from a more energetic particle population that left the sub - shock more recently .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether one can model non - steady state shock acceleration in the two fluid approach by broadening the definition of @xmath9 so that it includes this flux asymmetry .",
    "note that pressure equilibrium ( equation  [ eq : momentum ] ) is probably a good approximation even in non - steady state situations . as a result",
    ", the relation between @xmath87 and @xmath8 is expected to be valid even in non - steady state situations .      in the present model",
    "the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath52 , @xmath8 , @xmath64 , and @xmath89 are independent on @xmath65 , and encompass the solutions for particle acceleration based on nonlinear kinetic models @xcite , in which the same equations of the mass flux and the momentum flux conservation are adopted .",
    "typically the kinetic models depend on two free parameters : the injection efficiency and the maximum momentum , beyond which particles will escape from the system .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : blasi ] our formalism agrees with the results of @xcite , but the solutions by @xcite all cluster around @xmath90 and @xmath52 around the maximum possible compression factor . the two - fluid approach , however , allows for a broader range of solutions",
    ".    in the two - fluid model @xmath9 depends on @xmath65 , which is essentially a free parameter . in the kinetic models",
    "@xmath9 is determined self - consistently by the overall hydrodynamic structure of the shock , including the dynamical effects of the accelerated particles .",
    "the energy distribution of the accelerated particles determines then @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the cosmic - ray pressure and @xmath93 the cosmic - ray energy density .",
    "hence the kinematic models predict that the @xmath94 diagram should deviate from ours with @xmath0 , and should lie between our curves of @xmath0 and @xmath95 . in practice",
    ", however , the cosmic - ray adiabatic index as obtained by the kinetic models is very close to @xmath0 for @xmath96 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : blasi ] .",
    "for @xmath97 we found that a modest increase to @xmath98 resulted in a good match between the two - fluid solutions and the kinetic model of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the two - fluid solutions presented here indicate that a higher energy flux escape is necessary for @xmath99 , but from the point of view of the spectral energy distribution the energy escape flux is more difficult to achieve for spectra with spectral energy indices @xmath100 ( @xmath101 , corresponding to @xmath99 .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath100 most of the cosmic - ray energy is contained by mildly relativistic particles , whereas most of the escaping particles will be near the maximum of the energy distribution ( @xmath102 in the blasi model ) .",
    "hence , the escaping particles carry away only a small fraction of the internal energy . for @xmath103 most energy",
    "is indeed concentrated around @xmath102 and the necessary escape flux is easily generated .",
    "so from a thermodynamic point of view , a high fractional cosmic - ray pressure @xmath8 , requires large values of @xmath9 , which in turn is best achieved with @xmath104 .",
    "one of the motivations for this work has been the measurements of the downstream temperature of snrs with reasonably well known velocities @xcite .",
    "these temperatures were measured using the broad component of the h@xmath3 line .",
    "this component is due to charge exchange between neutral hydrogen atoms entering the shock and the downstream population of shock heated protons .",
    "hence , the width of the line is caused by thermal doppler broadening and reflects the downstream proton temperature .",
    "there is some ambiguity as to how to relate the proton temperature to the overall downstream plasma temperature , as the different plasma constituents ( electrons , protons , helium , other ions ) may not be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , the proton temperature is always expected to be within a factor of 2 of the mean plasma temperature .    using equation  ( [ eq : beta ] ) ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : beta ] ) one can easily estimate from a measured temperature and shock velocity what the downstream fractional cosmic - ray pressure is and what the required escape flux is .",
    "the only ambiguity that is left for estimating @xmath9 is what the effective cosmic - ray adiabatic index is .",
    "however , @xmath65 is not important for determining @xmath8 . for the snrs under consideration",
    "the shock velocities are well in excess of 1000  kms@xmath105 . for a typical sound speed in the interstellar medium of 10  kms@xmath105",
    ", we have @xmath106 .",
    "this means that the high mach number approximation is valid as long as @xmath107 .",
    "this appears to be the case for the snrs considered below .",
    "for the northeastern region of the tev gamma - ray emitting remnant rcw 86 @xcite measured a downstream temperature of @xmath108  kev for a measured shock velocity of @xmath109  kms@xmath105 .",
    "nominally this corresponds to @xmath110 ( see equation  ( [ eq : beta ] ) ) , but given the systematic uncertainties and the ambiguity due to non - equilibration of temperatures @xmath64 could be as high @xmath111 .",
    "using now equations  ( [ eq : w ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) in the limit for high mach numbers the measured values of @xmath64 correspond to downstream fractional cosmic - ray pressures and escape fractions of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , for @xmath0 and @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively .",
    "for @xmath40 this is @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively , with @xmath8 unchanged .    for the young large magellanic cloud remnant 0509 - 67.5 @xcite",

    "the most constraining measurement was for the southwestern region for which @xmath118  kev , for a conservative velocity estimate of @xmath119  kms@xmath105 , corresponding to @xmath120 .",
    "this translates into a downstream fractional cosmic - ray pressure of @xmath121 for @xmath0 or @xmath122 for @xmath40 .",
    "interestingly , these new estimates of @xmath8 based on equations  ( [ eq : w ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) are not far from the lower limits given by @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the less constraining relations used by @xcite allow in principle for a higher fractional cosmic - ray pressure by reducing the cosmic - ray escape flux .",
    "the relations derived here do not allow for this possibility .",
    "moreover the relation that was used to determine the lower limit by @xcite is a limiting case of the shock relations presented here ( see equation  ( [ eq : epsw ] ) ) .",
    "this brings us back to one of the principle issues currently discussed in cosmic - ray physics ,",
    "namely do very efficiently accelerating shock exist ?",
    "the post - shock temperatures measured by @xcite indicate high values for the cosmic - ray pressure , but not as high as usually found by particle acceleration models , where the efficiency is often found to be close to 90% , with total compression factors as high as @xmath123 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has been argued by @xcite that such extreme conditions may exist in the prominent tev gamma - ray source snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite .",
    "apart from high gamma - ray luminosity this idea is based on the lack of detectable thermal x - ray emission .",
    "according to @xcite this could be due to a very low post - shock plasma temperature , possibly as low as low as six times the upstream .",
    "alternatively , rx j1713.7 - 3946 may evolve in a low density medium , resulting in a low thermal luminosity , as the thermal luminosity scales with the square of the density .",
    "the equations derived here allow for very low downstream temperatures .",
    "however , the claim by @xcite that the downstream temperature may only be six times the upstream temperature seems unrealistic , as equation  ( [ eq : w ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) show that this is only true for unrealistically low mach numbers . for more realistic mach numbers for young snrs ,",
    "say @xmath124 , the downstream temperature is at least 80 times the upstream temperature .",
    "it could be that the young snrs that we observe are already past their prime as cosmic - ray accelerators , although the cosmic - ray escape in rcw 86 appears still high enough to explain the cosmic - ray energy production of snrs . specifically it has been argued that in the very early snr phase / supernova phase cosmic - ray acceleration may be very efficient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "note that a steady escape of cosmic rays during the evolution of a snr is favored over a more sudden release of cosmic - rays at the end of the snr evolution , as in the latter case adiabatic losses have lowered the energy of the cosmic - rays @xcite . if one wants to explain the cosmic - ray energy density in the galaxy by cosmic - ray escaping from young snr shocks ( i.e. @xmath125% , see introduction ) then on average over the lifetime of the snr a fractional cosmic - ray pressure is necessary of at least @xmath126% for @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that for a two - fluid steady state shock consisting of a thermal gas plus a cosmic - ray component there exist a unique relation between the downstream fraction of pressure provide by cosmic rays ( @xmath8 ) on the one hand , and the energy escape flux normalized to the incoming free energy flux ( @xmath9 ) on the other hand .",

    "@xmath127 no cosmic - ray pressure is allowed .",
    "this could be of interest for particle acceleration in clusters of galaxies , since internal cluster shocks tend to be low mach number shocks , whereas the accretion shocks or cluster formation shock are high mach number shocks .",
    "this relation can be used to determine @xmath8 and @xmath9 based on measurements of the downstream temperature of the plasma for a known shock velocity . using this relation",
    "we show that the _ lower limits _ on @xmath8 inferred for shock regions in the supernova remnants rcw 86 and snr 0509 - 675 by @xcite are in fact very close to the actual value for @xmath8 , but we can now determine also @xmath9 , which is at least @xmath128 for the northeastern region of rcw 86 , but only 0.067 for snr 0509 - 675 ( but it may be 0.19 in the unlikely case that the cosmic rays have an effective adiabtaic index of @xmath40 ) .    in order to explain the cosmic - ray energy density in the galaxy by cosmic - rays escaping directly from snr shocks , instead of released at the end of the snr life , one needs an escape flux of @xmath129% , which requires that on average 30% of the downstream snr pressure should be supplied by cosmic rays .",
