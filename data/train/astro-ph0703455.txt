    "the simplest models of inflation involve only a single scalar field , the inflaton @xcite . with a suitably chosen potential , such a model can provide a simple explanation of the temperature fluctuations in the cmb at all angular scales @xcite .",
    "there are however a number of possible anomalies in the cmb power spectrum that have attracted the attention of many researchers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( however see also @xcite . )",
    "none of these anomalies is by itself statistically compelling ; however , taken together they provide a hint that these features may be significant .",
    "much discussion of anomalies involves the power spectrum at low @xmath1 , @xmath8 at large scales , where several anomalies indicate a possible spatial asymmetry in the power spectrum , most often roughly a north - south galactic coordinate asymmetry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    the possibility that there may be an asymmetry in the observed cmb power spectrum",
    "was first raised by eriksen @xmath9 @xcite and hansen @xmath9 @xcite using the first year wmap data .",
    "their data analysis suggested a difference in power of roughly 20% for low @xmath1 maximized in the direction of galactic coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly no effect was seen above @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the analysis of the power spectrum in the vicinity of the first acoustic peak @xcite showed no evidence of a spatial asymmetry . at low values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the cosmic variance provides an intrinsic scatter in the power spectrum data , so that even though the signal is rather large , the statistical significance of their result was below 3 standard deviations .    in their three year data",
    "release @xcite , the wmap team addressed the isotropy of the power spectrum , finding a small asymmetry in a direction consistent with eriksen @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the method introduced by the wmap team to investigate asymmetries in the cmb spectrum is to multiply an isotropic gaussian cmb field by a large scale modulation function .",
    "they test both a dipole and a quadrupole modulation and find that the significance of the signal is not statistically compelling .",
    "their analysis uses a pixel size of @xmath12 which makes their analysis sensitive up to @xmath13 .",
    "the original eriksen team has also revisited the wmap 3 year data @xcite using a statistical framework similar to the wmap team s with a modulation function .",
    "they choose a higher resolution with a pixel size of @xmath14 including multipoles up to @xmath11 in their analysis and confirm the asymmetry with a higher statistical significance than the wmap team and in consistency with their previous analysis of the first year wmap data .",
    "hansen @xmath15 @xcite and maino @xmath15 @xcite explored two different approaches to extract the cmb spectrum where wmap data itself is used for foreground removal , and both find an asymmetry of the power spectrum at largest scales consistent with previous analysis and with each other . the fact that the asymmetry does not vary when different foreground subtraction procedures are applied constitutes a strong argument against a galactic origin for the asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the asymmetry was also found in cobe data @xcite which indicates that systematics may not be the correct explanation for a large scale asymmetry in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "rth @xmath9 @xcite have also found the asymmetry in the wmap 3 year data using statistical techniques different from the ones used in previous analyses .",
    "recent analyses of wmap 5 year data show a similar anisotropy of power between the two hemispheres , but with the asymmetry possibly reaching to higher multipoles @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the nature of the asymmetry and the maximum asymmetry direction remains almost the same , and it will be interesting to see what results from planck will have to say about an asymmetry at small scales .",
    "these analyses provide motivations for the study of inflationary models that can generate a spatial asymmetry at low @xmath1 while remaining isotropic at larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "if these anomalies prove to be valid indicators of an asymmetry in the power spectrum , they can provide a direct probe of inflationary dynamics .",
    "significant work that attempts to find a solution to these anomalies has already appeared @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the literature .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a simple situation that could lead to a spatial asymmetry in the cmb power spectrum at low values of @xmath1 within single field inflation .",
    "this involves an initial period of fast - roll expansion driven by the inflaton kinetic energy .",
    "the possibility of such an initial fast - roll period has been proposed by contaldi , peloso , kofman and linde ( cpkl ) @xcite as a mechanism to explain the lack of cmb power at low @xmath1 .",
    "this mechanism provides a suppression of the spectrum of primordial perturbations and thus of the cmb at large scales , and it has also been worked on by others @xcite .",
    "we will argue that in situations where the initial kinetic energy is significant in comparison to the potential energy , we should also expect the presence of a spatial gradient in the initial conditions of the inflaton field .",
    "we will show that even a surprisingly small value of an initial gradient  of order a few percent  will leave an observable spatial asymmetry in the cmb power spectrum at low @xmath1 .",
    "essentially , the power suppression in the fast - roll model occurs at scales that depend sensitively on the initial magnitude of the scalar field in the frame where the kinetic energy is uniform and isotropic .",
    "this leads to a characteristic pattern for the spatial dependence of the power spectrum . while we will provide a brief discussion of two - field models below",
    ", we here focus on the single field fast - roll option because of its simplicity and predictive power .",
    "inflation provides an explanation for the isotropy and homogeneity of the present universe . rather than having to postulate extremely smooth initial conditions for the early universe , a long period of inflation will take non - smooth initial conditions and still lead to a highly isotropic and homogeneous observable universe today .",
    "however , if the number of e - foldings of inflation is just barely the minimal number , about 60 , the initial conditions could be relevant and could modify the first few e - foldings .",
    "the cpkl mechanism @xcite postulates an initial period of kinetic energy dominance which then rapidly evolves into the standard slow - roll paradigm where the potential energy dominates and the universe inflates . if the slow - roll phase is many e - foldings longer than the minimum number of e - folds , the effects of the initial kinetic phase will be unobservable since the scales associated to its effects will be stretched far beyond our observable horizon .",
    "however , if the slow - roll phase is close to the minimum number of e - folds , then that initial kinetic phase will modify the first few e - foldings that generate the cmb power spectrum on largest scales , @xmath8 for small values of @xmath1 .    in a universe dominated by a uniform scalar field ,",
    "the equations of motion are the klein - gordon equation on a frw background @xmath16 and the friedman equation . ] @xmath17 and the equation of state parameter is @xmath18    the cpkl assumption is an initial condition in which the inflaton velocity , @xmath19 , is non - zero and the kinetic energy term is dominant over the potential energy , @xmath20 . during this initial phase @xmath21 and the expansion of the universe will be decelerating similar to a matter dominated universe rather than a desitter expansion . in this phase",
    "the kinetic energy rapidly decreases , until eventually the potential energy dominates and we enter the usual slow - roll phase .",
    "there is a short transitional phase when the potential energy already dominates and the universe inflates , but the inflaton velocity has not yet settled to its slow - roll value @xmath22 .",
    "the initial conditions involve specifying both @xmath23 and @xmath19 which have to be chosen appropriately to obtain only about 60 e - folds of inflation so that the effects of the initial fast - roll stage are observable .",
    "cpkl then show that the quantum fluctuations are suppressed during the onset of inflation when the inflaton is fast - rolling  this will be reviewed in the next section .",
    "the picture that emerges then involves suppressed fluctuations at early times followed by standard slow - roll behavior .",
    "since the earliest times correspond to the largest scales , the low @xmath1 multipoles are suppressed while the higher ones are standard .",
    "our extension of cpkl comes from the observation that the initial conditions in @xmath23 and @xmath19 need not be the same at all positions in space . if they are close to uniform , one can expand the values in a multipole expansion .",
    "the first deviation from uniformity would consist of a gradient in the initial conditions across the initial patch .",
    "we will consider only such leading linear deviations from uniformity in this paper .",
    "cpkl invoke a uniform initial condition in @xmath19 .",
    "actually this is not a separate assumption .",
    "because the value of @xmath19 is changing with time , one can always choose a time - slicing such that @xmath19 is uniform across the initial time slice .",
    "that is , if there is a gradient in the initial condition for @xmath19 using one definition of the initial time slice , one can change to another definition such that this variable is uniform .",
    "however , in this frame there is no a priori reason for the initial value of the magnitude of @xmath23 itself to be uniform .",
    "a mechanism that can produce a temporal variation in @xmath23 can in principle also produce a spatial gradient in the field .",
    "we could equally well define a different time frame in which the initial condition of @xmath23 is uniform , but in this frame we would in general not expect that the initial value of @xmath19 is constant in space .",
    "it is an extra assumption to assume that the initial conditions for @xmath23 and @xmath19 are spatially uniform in the same frame .",
    "@xmath24    we can obtain an invariant description of the evolution of the inflaton by considering trajectories in the @xmath25 plane , displayed in fig . [ figurephasespace ] for a chaotic inflation potential @xmath26 .",
    "there are three phases visible in this plot : initially , kinetic energy dominates and due to the rapid decrease in the kinetic energy , the trajectory runs quickly to the slow - roll attractor line where @xmath27 .",
    "all initial trajectories are attracted to this line - this is one of the key features of inflation .",
    "finally at the end of inflation , there is inflaton decay and reheating .",
    "however , different starting points lead to differing amounts of the slow - roll phase ",
    "these are shown as different initial trajectories .",
    "the number of e - folds of slow - roll inflation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the field value when the phase space trajectory hits the slow - roll attractor .",
    "if we start in a frame with a uniform value of @xmath23 , which would be represented by a vertical slice through the initial trajectories , one needs significantly different initial values of @xmath19 in order to end up at different points on the slow - roll attractor .",
    "however , if we use a frame with uniform initial values of @xmath19 , which would be a horizontal slice through the trajectories , only a small difference in the initial values of @xmath23 are required to produce distinct trajectories with differing amounts of slow - roll behavior and thus differing amounts of inflation .",
    "we will see that gradients of order only a few percent are needed for observable effects . because the potential energy is subdominant at the initial time , this is only a very small gradient in the initial energy density .",
    "therefore , an initial slice with constant @xmath30 is the better choice since we want to work with a frw metric that requires a homogeneous and isotropic energy density .    if the inflaton field is not uniform , the klein - gordon equation , eq .",
    "( [ kgeq ] ) , contains an additional term proportional to @xmath31 . for a gradient in the field , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants , @xmath35 so that we can neglect this term and still work with eq .",
    "( [ kgeq ] ) .",
    "the gradient however contributes a term to the energy density of the form @xmath36 , which for a linear gradient in the field @xmath23 amounts to a constant throughout space .",
    "there is also an anisotropic contribution to the pressure proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "however , the gradient s contribution to the energy density and pressure is always subdominant for the small amounts of gradients we require so that we can neglect it .",
    "thus , even in the presence of a small spatial gradient , the inflaton field evolves independently at each spatial position .",
    "that is , in our approximation the trajectories displayed in fig .",
    "1 are not modified by the presence of a spatial gradient",
    ".    in our extension with a gradient in the initial conditions , two points on opposite sides of the universe which started with different initial values of @xmath23 will have undergone different amounts of inflation so that the large scale suppression features in the power spectrum associated to an initial fast - roll stage will appear at different scales today .",
    "a gradient in e - folds of inflation is the leading effect in our model stretching both the cutoff scale and space by a different amount in different parts of the universe .",
    "certainly , it is not strictly correct to use a frw background metric and the standard formulas for a uniform and isotropic cosmology .",
    "however , the expansion is uniform and isotropic both during the fast roll phase when the kinetic energy is dominant , and later during the slow roll phase .",
    "the inhomogeneity only effects the universe during the very short transition region between fast - roll and slow - roll of the inflaton .",
    "we feel that our treatment captures the leading effects of an initial gradient without the need to solve exactly the evolution through the short transition region .",
    "an initial regime of kinetic energy dominance of the inflaton before reaching the slow - roll attractor modifies the spectrum of quantum fluctuations as noted by cpkl . for wavelengths much smaller than the hubble scale at the onset of the accelerated expansion , @xmath38",
    ", the spectrum is the same as the slow - roll spectrum because the small wavelength perturbations are insensitive to the overall background expansion of the universe at this time .",
    "however , for wavelengths comparable to @xmath38 the spectrum is altered and it exhibits a suppression of power for larger wavelengths . intuitively , this suppression can be understood from the relation @xmath39 : if the inflaton rolls faster initially , the spectrum will be suppressed at larger scales .",
    "following cpkl , we use a chaotic inflation model with potential @xmath40 with @xmath41 . as initial conditions ,",
    "we choose @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this particular choice of initial conditions gives us about @xmath44 e - folds of inflation .",
    "the initial kinetic energy is 100 times larger than the initial potential energy so that we start out well in the kinetic energy domination regime .",
    "we use the gauge invariant formalism for cosmological perturbations @xcite and the equations of motion for the perturbation variables read @xmath45 where primes denote differentiation with respect to conformal time @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we solve these perturbation equations using numerical mode by mode integration . as",
    "the system is initially in the kinetic energy domination regime , the vacuum is chosen to be the approximate solution in the kinetic energy domination stage at an initial time @xmath48",
    "@xcite @xmath49 where the mukhanov - sasaki variable is @xmath50 we verified that a different choice of vacuum , the hamiltonian diagonalization vacuum given by @xcite @xmath51 does not change the resulting power spectrum significantly .",
    "@xmath52    in fig .",
    "[ figurespectrumfastroll ] we show the power spectrum of the gravitational potential after the end of inflation .",
    "the cutoff of the spectrum around @xmath53 is the most important feature of the spectrum , but some oscillations at the transition to a pure slow - roll spectrum are visible as well .",
    "the position of the cutoff in the spectrum , @xmath8 the scale associated to the cutoff , actually depends on the complete expansion history of the universe since the onset of inflation until today , which is not exactly known .    instead of computing the spectrum",
    "numerically cpkl have also shown that an approximate analytic solution with an instantaneous transition between the regimes of kinetic energy domination and slow - roll inflation reproduces the exact spectrum extremely well .",
    "this shows that the spectrum does not depend much on the details of the inflaton potential .",

    "a variety of astrophysical processes make this a complicated and highly numerical task which is usually performed with numerical codes @xcite . since the power spectrum in wavenumber",
    "is not modified at large @xmath59 , the cmb spectrum will be the same as the standard slow - roll predictions at high multipoles @xmath1 . at low @xmath1",
    "the leading effects are the sachs wolfe effect and the late time integrated sachs wolfe effect . for the calculation of the cmb spectrum",
    "we have modified the numerical code camb @xcite to include the cpkl primordial power spectrum as the initial spectrum .",
    "the resulting cmb spectrum is shown in fig . [ clspectrumfastroll ] .",
    "one of the main results is the fact that the features in the primordial spectrum get somewhat smoothed in the cmb spectrum but the shape is generally not altered very significantly .",
    "we see the power suppression at low multipoles due to the initial fast - roll stage of the inflaton field , and at high multipoles the spectrum matches the flat slow - roll spectrum .",
    "the effect of the wiggles around the cutoff is also evident in the cmb spectrum .",
    "however , we note that unlike the primordial spectrum of fig .",
    "[ figurespectrumfastroll ] , the cmb spectrum for multipoles smaller than the scale of the cutoff does not approach zero as quickly , but seems to have an offset which depends on the scale of the cutoff , see also fig .",
    "[ cltwospectrafastroll ] .",
    "this offset arises due to the late time integrated sachs - wolfe effect which gives contributions to @xmath60 from a wider range of scales than the sachs - wolfe effect does . in the presence of a cutoff in the spectrum at large scales ,",
    "the late time integrated sachs - wolfe effect is therefore more important than the sachs - wolfe effect at very low @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "@xmath61    the cpkl mechanism is reasonably predictive in that there is only one free parameter , the scale of the feature in the spectrum , which is determined by the number of e - folds @xmath62 of inflation and thus by the relative values of the initial conditions for @xmath23 and @xmath19  see fig .",

    "observationally , this is manifest as the value of @xmath1 below which there is a suppression in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "with a spatial gradient in the initial value of @xmath23 in the frame where @xmath19 is uniform , parts with different initial values undergo different amounts of inflation .",
    "once all portions of the observable universe are in the slow - roll phase , the standard inflationary description holds with cmb fluctuations at these scales and subsequent structure formation being spatially uniform .",
    "the effect of the initial gradient only modifies the transition region between kinetic domination and slow - roll .",
    "this transition yields the cutoff in the spectrum at the scale @xmath59 that will be stretched by different factors in different parts of the sky due to the presence of the gradient .",
    "let us consider two different parts of the universe with slightly different initial field values @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "[ fig_ns_full_sup ] , a significant suppression only arises for the lowest mutipoles @xmath148 .",

    "we additionally discuss two toy models .",
    "the first one uses a step - function primordial spectrum , which allows us to perform parts of the hemisphere averaging analytically without having to approximate the gradient as steps . as a second toy model we consider a primordial spectrum of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ exponentialcutoff ] ) but with a significantly softer cutoff than the cklp spectrum .",
    "such a more gradual cutoff could potentially achieve an asymmetry reaching to higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "the data appears to suggest a spatial modulation in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "however , this asymmetry is unusual in that it may only be present at largest scales or multipoles @xmath152 .",
    "if inflation lasts only about 60 e - folds , this can occur if at the earliest stages of inflation there is an asymmetry which however disappears at later times of inflation .",
    "provided the later stages of inflation are governed by a single slowly rolling field , the power spectrum at high @xmath1 and the universe today will be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "however the quantum fluctuations at the earliest times , and hence the power spectrum at low multipoles , will show evidence of the initial lack of isotropy .",
    "we have provided a model of how this situation could have developed within the framework of single field inflation .",
    "it is based on the cpkl mechanism for large scale power suppression due to an initial fast - roll stage paired with a gradient in the initial values of the inflaton field .",
    "a gradient in the initial conditions is manifest as differing numbers of e - foldings of slow - roll behavior on different sides of the universe .",
    "this amounts to shifts in the @xmath1 values at which the suppression of the cmb power at large angular scales occurs .",
    "this model has a distinctive pattern for the generation of spatial asymmetries which makes it very predictive , and apart from the asymmetry axis , there are only two additional parameters characterizing the position of the cutoff and the amount of gradient within the observable universe .    our simple analysis where we approximated the initial gradient by a series of steps and averaged these over two hemispheres provided a first comparison to wmap data extracted from different hemispheres . while our model reproduces the qualitative features of the data and improves the fit by @xmath146 , we can not claim a preference for our model since it involves the introduction of in total four new parameters . because of the geometric effect on the expansion of space resulting from differing amounts of inflation due to the initial gradient , a much better fit in a hemisphere analysis is hard to achieve with our simple single field model with an initial fast - roll stage and a gradient .",
    "nevertheless , one could improve on our analysis by performing a full covariance analysis of the model including all anisotropic degrees of freedom , such as studied in @xcite .",
    "in this way , one would use the information contained in the general correlations @xmath99 , including off - diagonal terms which vanish in the homogeneous and isotropic limit .",
    "it is also possible to generate spatial asymmetries in the power spectrum through the use of two or more fields . in this case , it is possible to assume that one field has a spatial gradient in the frame in which the other field is uniform .",
    "here there is a lot more freedom . with two fields ,",
    "each field has its own potential with the possibility of a cross coupling between the fields .",
    "these possibilities enable one to modify the shape of the inflaton potential in different ways either enhancing or suppressing the rolling of the inflaton field and also modifying the amount of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the resulting possibilities for generating asymmetries deserve further study .",
    "such models are more flexible , but are inherently less predictive than the single field model studied in this paper . however",
    ", at least some of these theories could have a similar phenomenology . by providing an initial faster evolution",
    ", one can suppress the curvature fluctuations providing a cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum , and a gradient in this initial condition would survive for only a few e - foldings . with the additional freedom in multi field models ,",
    "one may be able to find a model where the geometric effect which limits our single field model s capability to obtain a significant asymmetry between hemispheres extending beyond @xmath153 is absent or less restrictive .",
    "we note also that our model , and possible generalizations , have the potential to impact the analyses of other anomalies .",
    "for example , the cold spot uncovered in @xcite occurs along the same axis as the power spectrum modulation . in our model",
    "the primary effect is the lack of power in some direction .",
    "our hemisphere fit suggested that one hemisphere is close to the pure slow - roll while the other hemisphere shows the suppression .",
    "this could be similar in effect to the existence of a cold spot .",
    "likewise , it is possible that this mechanism can modify the analysis of the unusual quadrupole - octopole alignments . when attempting a partial wave decomposition , an overall dipole shifts the underlying power from one multipole to neighboring ones with @xmath154 .",
    "our modulation in the spectrum is not exactly a dipole , but could nevertheless shift the apparent power from one multipole to nearby ones",
    ".    it would be interesting to see if the addition of this form of spatial gradient to the studies that fit the cmb spectrum can provide further understanding of the proposed anomalies that are discussed in the literature .",
    "for that a more involved comparison to data than ours is needed .",
