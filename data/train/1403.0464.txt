    "it is known that cortical neurons _ in vivo _ present a high discharge variability , even if stimulated by current injection , in comparison with neurons _ in vitro _  @xcite . in particular , these differences are peculiar of pyramidal neurons , while inter - neurons reveal a high neuronal firing variability in both settings  @xcite .",
    "this variability is usually measured in terms of the coefficient of variation @xmath0 of the single neuron inter - spike interval ( isi ) , defined as the normalized standard deviation of the isi , i.e , @xmath1 @xcite . for cortical pyramidal neurons @xmath2 _ in vivo _",

    "@xcite , while for cortical inter - neurons @xmath4",
    "@xcite in both settings .",
    "the variability of the spike emissions _ in vivo _ resembles a stochastic ( poissonian ) process ( where @xmath5 ) , however the neural dynamics features can not be accounted by simple stochastic models @xcite .",
    "these phenomena can be instead modelized by considering a deterministically balanced network , where inhibitory and excitatory activity on average compensate one another  @xcite . despite the many papers devoted in the last two decades to this subject ,",
    "is still unclear which is the dynamical phenomenon responsible for the observed irregular dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a few authors pointed out the possibility that _ stable chaos _",
    "@xcite could be intimately related to the dynamical behavior of balanced states  @xcite .",
    "stable chaos is a dynamical regime characterized by linear stability ( i.e. the maximal lyapunov exponent is negative ) , yet displaying an erratic behavior over time scales diverging exponentially with the system size .",
    "stable chaos has been discovered in arrays of diffusively coupled discontinuous maps  @xcite and later observed also in inhibitory neural networks  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the prevalence of nonlinear instabilities over the linear ( stable ) evolution of the system .",
    "this leads in diffusively coupled systems to propagation of information ( driven by nonlinear effects ) and in diluted inhibitory networks to abrupt changes in the firing order of the neurons  @xcite .",
    "clear evidences of stable chaos have been reported in inhibitory @xmath6coupled networks by considering conductance based models  @xcite as well as current based models with time delay  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these analysis focused on the characterization of the time needed for the transient irregular dynamics to relax to the final stable state , the authors convincingly show that these transients diverge exponentially with the system size , a key feature of stable chaos .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite it has been shown that , by considering time extended post - synaptic pulses leads to a transition from stable to regular chaos , where fluctuation driven dynamics is apparently maintained  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to compare the dynamics of a balanced network , whose dynamics is driven by fluctuations in the synaptic inputs , with neural networks composed of tonically firing neurons .",
    "similar comparisons have been performed in several previous studies  @xcite , however here we would like to focus on the role of nonlinear instabilities and in particular on indicators capable to measure finite amplitude instabilities in such networks .",
    "the effect of finite perturbations is relevant from the point of view of neuroscience , where the analysis is usually performed at the level of spike trains , and a _ minimal _ perturbation corresponds to the removal or addition of a spike .",
    "this kind of perturbations can produce a detectable modification of the firing rate _ in vivo _ in the rat barrel cortex  @xcite .",
    "this has been reported as the first experimental demonstration of the sensitivity of an intact network to perturbations _ in vivo _ , or equivalently of an erratic behavior in neural circuits .",
    "it is however unclear if this sensitivity should be associated to linear or nonlinear effects .",
    "in particular the authors in  @xcite considered a network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons , where an extra spike in the excitatory network is soon compensated by an extra spike in the inhibitory network , indicating a sort of balance in the activity of the studied neural circuit .",
    "the ability of a perturbed balanced network to restore rapidly the steady firing rate has been discussed also in  @xcite for a minimal model . furthermore , zillmer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that a finite perturbation in a stable regime can cause a divergence of the trajectories .",
    "these further studies , together with the fact that the addition of an extra spike is clearly a finite perturbation from the point of view of dynamical systems , suggest that the results reported in  @xcite can represent an experimental verification of stable chaos .",
    "even though all these findings are congruent with the nature of stable chaos @xcite , a careful characterization of this regime in neural networks in terms of finite amplitude indicators is still lacking . the only previous study examining this aspect in some details concerns a purely inhibitory recurrent leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neural network with an external excitatory drive , which can sustain balanced activity  @xcite . starting from this analysis , which was limited to @xmath6-pulses ,",
    "we have considered an extension the model to finite width pulses .",
    "furthermore , we have characterized the linearized evolution via usual lyapunov exponents and the nonlinear effects in terms of the response of the system to finite perturbations .",
    "this analysis has been performed by employing previously introduced indicators , like finite size lyapunov exponents ( fsles )  @xcite or the probability that a finite perturbation can be ( exponentially ) expanded  @xcite , and new indicators capable to capture nonlinear instabilities .    the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : model ] is devoted to the introduction of the neural network model used through this paper , together with the indicators able to characterize linear and nonlinear instabilities .",

    "the elements of the @xmath23 connectivity matrix @xmath24 are one ( zero ) in presence ( absence ) of a connection from the pre - synaptic @xmath25-th neuron to the post - synaptic @xmath9-th one . in this paper",
    "we limit our analysis to random sparse networks , where each neuron receives exactly @xmath22 pre - synaptic connections and this number remains fixed for any system size @xmath7 . the model appearing in eqs .",

    "our analysis will be devoted to the study of sparse networks , by considering a constant number @xmath22 of afferent synapses for each neuron , namely @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the normalization factor @xmath47 appearing in the definition of the pulse amplitude is somehow irrelevant , since here we limit to study a specific value of the in - degree connectivity , without varying @xmath22 .",
    "however , to compare with previous studies , we set @xmath48 for purely excitatory neurons , where @xmath49 , similarly to what done in @xcite , and @xmath50 for purely inhibitory networks , where @xmath51 , following the normalization employed in @xcite .",
    "the reasons for these different scalings rely on the fact that in the excitatory case , the dynamics of the system are _ current driven _",
    "( i.e. all neurons are tonically firing even in absence of coupling , being supra - threshold ) , therefore the synaptic input should be normalized with the number of afferent neurons to maintain an average homeostatic synaptic input  @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in presence of inhibitory coupling , here the supra - threshold excitability of the single neuron can be _ balanced _ by the inhibitory synaptic currents , thus maintaining the neurons in proximity of the firing threshold . in this case , the network dynamics is _ fluctuation driven _ , because the fluctuations in the synaptic inputs are responsible of the neuronal firing . in order to keep the amplitude of the fluctuations of the synaptic current constant ,",
    "the normalization is now assumed proportional to the square root of the number of the synaptic inputs  @xcite . in the present analysis",
    "we have tuned the model parameters in order to be in a fluctuation driven regime whenever the inhibitory coupling is considered . in particular , we will study , not only the dependence of the dynamics on the pulse shape , but also on the system size , by maintaining a constant number of incoming connections @xmath22 .",
    "however , we will not assume that the excitatory external drive ( in our case represented by the neuronal excitability @xmath52 ) will diverge proportionally to @xmath53 , as done in  @xcite , since we are not interested in the emergence of a _ self - tuned _ balanced state in the limit @xmath54 , for @xmath55  @xcite .      to perform the linear stability analysis of the system",

    "the expression of @xmath58 can be computed by differentiating and @xmath59 where @xmath60    in this paper , we will limit to measure the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath61 to characterize the linear stability of the studied models .",
    "this is defined as the the average growth rate of the infinitesimal perturbation @xmath62 through the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the initial perturbation at time zero .",
    "the evolution of the perturbation @xmath65 has been followed by performing at regular time intervals the rescaling of its amplitude to avoid numerical artifacts , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since our system is time continuous one would expect to have always a zero lyapunov exponent , which in fact is the maximal lyapunov if the system is not chaotic .",
    "however , this does not apply to the event driven map because the evolution is based on a discrete time dynamics , where the motion along the orbit between two successive spikes is no more present due to the performed poincar section .",
    "besides the characterization of the stability of infinitesimal perturbations , we are also interested in analyzing how a perturbation grows according to its amplitude . to perform this task several indicators have been introduced in the last years , ranging from _ finite size lyapunov exponents _ ( fsle )  @xcite to the propagation velocity of finite perturbations  @xcite .",
    "fsles have been mainly employed to charaterize _ stable chaos _ in spatially extended systems @xcite and collective chaos in globally coupled systems @xcite .",
    "we have performed several tests by employing the usual fsle definition @xcite . in particular fsle",
    "can be defined by considering an unperturbed trajectory @xmath66 and a perturbed trajectory @xmath67 , obtained by randomly perturbing all the coordinates ( both the fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 as well as the membrane potentials ) of the generic configuration @xmath70 on the attractor .",
    "then we follow the two trajectories in time by measuring their distance @xmath71 , by employing the absolute value norm . whenever @xmath72 crosses ( for the first time ) a series of exponentially spaced thresholds @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , the crossing times @xmath75 are registered .",
    "by averaging the time separation between consecutive crossings over different pairs of trajectories , one obtains the fsle @xcite @xmath76 for small enough thresholds , one recovers the usual maximal lyapunov exponent , while for large amplitudes , fsle saturates to zero , since a perturbation can not be larger than the size of the accessible phase - space . in the intermediate range ,",
    "@xmath77 tells us how the growth of a perturbation is affected by nonlinearities .",
    "however , as a general remark , we have noticed that it is extremely difficult to get reliable results from the fsle analysis , probably because the estimation of @xmath77 relies on measurements based on single trajectory realizations , which presents huge fluctuations . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "the single trajectory should be smoothed before estimating the passage times from one threshold to the next one and we observed that the results strongly depend on the adopted smoothing procedure , in particular for the fluctuation driven case .    therefore , in order to investigate the growth rate of finite amplitude perturbations we have decided to adopt different indicators rather than the fsle .",
    "in particular , an estimation of finite size stability can be obtained by defining the following indicator @xmath78 where the average @xmath79 is performed over many different initial conditions . in the limit @xmath80",
    "we expect to recover the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath61 . in order to ensure that the dynamics of the perturbed trajectory will also occur on the attractor associated to the studied dynamics , we have considered extremely small initial perturbations @xmath81 . as we will show , after a transient needed for the perturbed trajectory @xmath82 to relax to the attractor , @xmath83 measures effectively the maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "however , if nonlinear mechanisms are present @xmath83 can become larger than @xmath61 for finite amplitude perturbations . anyway , analogously to the fsle , for perturbations of the size of the attractor the indicator @xmath83 decays towards zero due to the trajectory folding .",
    "the studied models present discontinuities of @xmath84 in the membrane potentials @xmath8 , due to the reset mechanisms , and of @xmath85 in the fields @xmath86 , due to the pulse arrival . in order to reveal , without any ambiguity , the presence of nonlinear instabilities at finite amplitudes , for the estimation of the fsle and of the indicator @xmath87 we mainly limit our analysis to the continuous fields @xmath88 . in particular , to characterize the finite amplitude instabilities , we consider the following distance between the perturbed and unperturbed orbits @xmath89 in some cases we have also analyzed the distance @xmath90 between all the variables associated to the unperturbed and perturbed state with a clear meaning of the adopted symbol .    unfortunately , the indicator @xmath83 as well as the fsle can not be employed in the case of stable chaos , when @xmath91 , because in this case small perturbations are quickly damped and one can not explore the effect of perturbation of growing amplitude by following the dynamics on the attractor . in this situation",
    ", one should employ different indicators , as done in @xcite for coupled map lattices .",
    "in particular , we proceed as follow , we consider two orbits at an initial distance @xmath92 and we follow them for a time interval @xmath93 , then we measure the amplitude of the perturbation at the final time , namely @xmath94 .",
    "we rescale one of the two orbits to a distance @xmath92 from the other one , keeping the direction of the perturbation unchanged , and we repeat the procedure several times and for several values of @xmath92 .",
    "then , we estimate the finite amplitude growth rate , as @xmath95 where the angular brackets denote the average over a sufficiently large number of repetitions . to allow the perturbed orbit to relax on the attractor , we initially perform @xmath96 rescalings , which are not included in the final average .",
    "however , also this procedure does not guarantee that the attractor is always reached , in particular for very large perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the perturbed dynamics is no more constrained to evolve along the tangent space associated to the event driven map . as a matter of fact ,",
    "whenever @xmath91 the indicator @xmath97 converges to zero and not to the lyapunov exponent associated to the discrete time map evolution .    finally ,",
    "following the analysis reported in  @xcite , we consider the probability @xmath98 that a perturbation of amplitude @xmath92 induces an exponential separation between the reference and perturbed trajectory .",
    "in particular , we perturb the reference orbit with an initial perturbation @xmath92 and we follow the evolution of the trajectories for a time span @xmath93 . whenever @xmath99 is larger than a certain threshold @xmath100 this trial contributes to the number of expanding initial perturbations @xmath101 , otherwise is not counted .",
    "we repeat this procedure @xmath102 times for each perturbation of amplitude @xmath92 , then @xmath103 . for the two latter indicators , namely @xmath104 and @xmath105 ,",
    "we have always employed the total distance @xmath90 , to confront our findings with the results reported in  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , we will compare a current driven excitatory network and a fluctuation driven inhibitory network . in particular , the excitatory network is studied in a regime where it presents a collective non trivial _ partial synchronization _",
    "this state is characterized by quasi - synchronous firing events , as revealed by the raster plot reported in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : raster_insieme ] , and almost periodic oscillations of the effective current @xmath106 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vtrace_insieme ] , upper panel ) . in this particular case",
    "@xmath107 therefore the neurons are always supra - threshold .",
    "in this situation the measure of the @xmath0 gives quite low values , namely for the studied case ( with @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) @xmath111 , similar to pyramidal neurons in _",
    "vitro_. despite this low level of variability in the neuronal dynamics , the sparseness in the matrix connectivity induces chaotic dynamics in the network , which persists even in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite . at variance with diluted networks , where the average connectivity scales proportionally to the system size ( @xmath112 , with @xmath113 ) . in this latter case , in the limit @xmath114 the system will recover a regular evolution , similarly to fully coupled networks  @xcite .",
    "for the inhibitory network , we observe radically different dynamics , this because now @xmath115 oscillates around one , therefore the neurons fire in a quite irregular manner , driven by the fluctuations of the fields @xmath28 , as shown in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : rasters ] ( a ) and ( b ) . in this case",
    "we have examined the dynamics of the model for @xmath108 , @xmath116 and different pulse - widths @xmath117 . for @xmath118 $ ]",
    "the neuronal dynamics are always quite erratic , being characterized by @xmath119 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cv_vs_alpha ] ) .",
    "narrower pulses ( larger @xmath26 values ) are associated to somehow more regular dynamics and smaller isi , however we have verified that the isi and cv saturates to some finite value in the thermodynamic limit ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv_isisvssize ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this suggests that fluctuations will not vanish for @xmath114 and that the system will remain fluctuation driven even in such a limit .",
    "furthermore , the two @xmath26-values examined in figs . [ fig : cv_vs_n ] and [ fig : isi_vs_n ] correspond to two different dynamical regimes , further discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : lyapunov_results ] , namely , a chaotic ( @xmath120 ) and a non - chaotic ( @xmath121 ) state .",
    "as previously shown , the fluctuation driven regime is observable for the inhibitory network for all the considered pulse widths . in this subsection",
    "we would like to investigate whether such variability is related to a linear instability of infinitesimal perturbations ( measured by the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath61 ) or to other ( nonlinear ) instabilities present in the system .",
    "let us start examining the lyapunov exponent for such systems , as a first result we observe a strong dependence of @xmath61 on the pulse - width ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_vs_alpha ] ) : the system is chaotic for wide pulses and becomes stable for sufficiently narrow ones .",
    "these results are in agreement with previously reported results in  @xcite for an inhibitory network of lif neurons with delayed synapses . in these papers",
    "the authors show that chaos can arise only for sufficiently broad pulses , conversely for @xmath6-pulses the system is always stable .",
    "it is worth to notice that the critical @xmath26-value at which occurs the transition to chaos becomes larger as the system size increases , pointing to the question whether the stable regime still exists for finite pulses in the thermodynamic limit or if it is merely a finite size property  @xcite .",
    "extensive simulations for sizes of the network up to @xmath122 have shown that the stable regime is present even for such a large size ( see fig.[fig : lambda_vs_n ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we have found an empirical scaling law describing the increase of @xmath61 with @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath123 where @xmath124 denotes the asymptotic value in the thermodynamic limit and @xmath125 is the scaling exponent .",
    "for the two representative cases here studied , the exponent was quite similar , namely @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) for @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , thus suggesting an universal scaling law for this model when fluctuation driven , with an exponent @xmath130 . this exponent is different from the one measured for the current driven case , in such situation for sparse connectivity @xmath61 converged to its asymptotic value as @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "an exponent @xmath132 has been previously measured for coupled map lattices exhibiting spatio - temporal chaos and theoretically justified in the framework of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation  @xcite .",
    "the scalings we are reporting in this paper are associated to random networks , therefore they demand for a new theoretical analysis . furthermore , the asymptotic values @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) indicate that a critical threshold separating stable from chaotic dynamics persists in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "stable chaos in spatially extended systems is due to the propagation of finite amplitude perturbations , while infinitesimal ones are damped . in inhibitory neural networks ,",
    "the origin of stable chaos has been ascribed to abrupt changes in the firing order of neurons induced by a discontinuity in the dynamical law , while infinitesimal perturbations leave the order unchanged  @xcite . in particular , by examining a conductance based model , in  @xcite it has been shown that a spike was able to induce a finite perturbation in the evolution of two ( not - symmetrically ) connected neurons , given that the inhibitory effect of a spike was related to the actual value of the membrane potential of the receiving neuron .",
    "therefore two ingredients are needed to observe stable chaos in neural models , a non symmetric coupling among neurons , together with the fact that the amplitude of transmitted pulses should depend on the neuron state .",
    "these requirements are fulfilled also in the present model , despite being current based , since any current based model can be easily transformed in a conductance based one via a nonlinear transformation  @xcite . however , the problem is to quantify this effect in terms of some indicator , similarly to what done in spatially extended systems , where stable chaos has been characterized in terms of the fsle and of the velocity of propagation of information @xcite .     for the fluctuation driven ( black circles ) and current driven ( red squares ) chaotic set - ups .",

    "fig : ddd3 ] ) .",
    "the peak broadens for increasing @xmath7 extending to larger amplitudes and also its height increases .",
    "the presence of more neurons in the network renders stronger the finite amplitude effects , while nonlinear instabilities are present at larger and larger perturbation amplitudes .",
    "so far we have considered only chaotic regimes , both in the fluctuation driven and in the current driven case . however , even in linearly stable cases the dynamics can be erratic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rasters ] for the fluctuation driven case corresponding to @xmath121 for which the maximal lyapunov is negative at any system size ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lyapunov ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this kind of erratic behavior , known as stable chaos @xcite , is one the most striking examples of dynamics driven by nonlinear effects , since the linear instabilities are asymptotically damped . in this situation",
    "neither the fsle nor the indicator @xmath83 can be measured .",
    "the reason is that , in order to ensure that the dynamics will take place on the associated attractor , finite amplitude perturbations are reached only by starting from very small initial perturbations , which in this case are damped .",
    "therefore , we should employ different indicators , namely the finite amplitude growth rate @xmath154 and the probability @xmath98 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lk_alpha5 ] , for the linearly stable fluctuation driven case corresponding to @xmath121 , @xmath155 for sufficiently small perturbations , as expected .",

    "[ fig : peaksvsn ] a linear decrease of @xmath157 with @xmath7 is clearly observable , while @xmath156 reveals a logarithmic increase with @xmath7 . thus suggesting that this indicator will diverge to infinity in the thermodynamic limit , similarly to the results previously reported in  @xcite .",
    "however , at variance with these latter studies , in the present context the connectivity remains finite even in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath98 , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : probtrans ] , reveals that the curve can be well fitted as @xmath158 analogously to what done in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath159 can be considered as a critical amplitude , setting the scale over which nonlinear instabilities take place .",
    "at variance with the results reported by monteforte & wolf in  @xcite , we observe a linear decrease with @xmath7 of the critical amplitude @xmath159 ( see fig . [",

    "furthermore , we have verified for various continuous @xmath26 pulses , with @xmath163 $ ] , that the measured exponent @xmath164 does not particularly depend on @xmath26 .",
    "the model here studied differs for the shape of the post - synaptic currents from the one examined in  @xcite , where @xmath6-pulses have been considered .    in our opinion , these two latter indicators , @xmath104 and @xmath105 bear essentially the same information : they measure the propensity of a perturbation @xmath92 to be amplified on a short time scale @xmath93 .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionparams ] ) the values of @xmath157 and @xmath159 , which set the relevant amplitude scales for the two indicators , both decrease with the same scaling law ( namely , @xmath131 ) with the system size .",
    "a possible explanation for this scaling could be found by assuming that the main source of nonlinear amplification is associated to a spike removal ( addition ) in the perturbed orbit . a missing ( extra )",
    "spike will perturb , to the leading order , the distance @xmath165 by an amount @xmath166 , since the lost ( added ) post - synaptic pulses are @xmath22 each of amplitude @xmath167 .",
    "this argument explains as well the logarithmic increase of @xmath156 with the system size .",
    "furthermore , the decrease of @xmath157 and @xmath159 with @xmath7 seems to indicate that in the thermodynamic limit any perturbation , even infinitesimal , will be amplified .",
    "this is clearly in contradiction with the fact that the system is linearly stable and it appears to remain stable by increasing @xmath7 ( as shown in fig .",

    ", it seems that a different non commutativity between the thermodynamic limit and the limit of vanishingly small perturbations is present , similar conclusions have been inferred also in  @xcite . therefore , we can apparently conclude that a fluctuation driven system , which is linearly stable , but presents nonlinear instabilities , will become unstable at any amplitude and time scales in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , one should be extremely careful in deriving any conclusion from these indicators , since they are not dynamical invariant and their values depend not only on the considered variables but also on the employed norm .",
    "furthermore , in the present context there is an additional problem related to the meaningful definition of the norm in an infinite space , as that achieved in the thermodynamic limit .    to understand the limit of applicability of @xmath104",
    ", we have examined this indicator also in the chaotic fluctuation driven case , namely for @xmath120 .",
    "also in this case we observe that @xmath157 will vanish for diverging system size , but with a different scaling law , namely @xmath168 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath156 increases with @xmath7 , but this time it appears to saturate in the thermodynamic limit with a scaling law similar to the one reported in ( [ eq : fitting ] ) for the maximal lyapunov exponent , more details are reported in the caption of fig . [",
    "fig : transitionparams ] . unlike the stable regime , in the chaotic one we can not justify with the simple spike addition ( removal ) argument the scaling with @xmath7 neither for @xmath157 nor for @xmath156 .",
    "it is high probable that in this regime the interactions of the linear and nonlinear instabilities leads to more complicated mechanisms .",
    "the evolution of the indicator @xmath104 suggests that for increasing @xmath7 its peak will move down to smaller and smaller amplitude scale .",
    "however , this result is in contradiction with the behavior of @xmath143 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddd3 ] , for this latter indicator the position of the peak is not particularly affected by @xmath7 . in particular , finite amplitude instabilities affect larger and larger scales , contrary to what seen for @xmath104 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lk_alpha5 ] ) .",
    "the same behavior is observable for @xmath150 , data not shown .",
    "these contradictory results point out the limits of indicators like @xmath104 and @xmath105 relying on dynamical evolutions not taking place on the attractor of the system .",
    "finally , in order to study the effect of the pulse shape on the finite amplitude behavior as measured by @xmath104 , we proceeded to calculate this indicator for various @xmath26-values .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peaklocation ] , for increasing @xmath26 ( corresponding to narrower peaks ) the position of the maximum @xmath157 moves towards larger amplitudes .",
    "this effect can be explained by the fact that the maximal lyapunov exponent decreases with @xmath26 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_vs_alpha ] ) and therefore perturbations of bigger and bigger amplitudes are required to destabilize the system for vanishingly pulse width .",
    "consistently also the parameter @xmath159 associated to @xmath105 increases for increasing @xmath26-values , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionparams ] ( b ) .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics and stability of current and fluctuation driven neural networks , the former ( latter ) have been realized as a purely excitatory ( inhibitory ) pulse coupled network of leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neurons with a sparse architecture . in particular , we considered random networks with a constant in - degree @xmath46 for any examined size .",
    "the excitatory network , despite being chaotic , reveals a low spiking variability . on the other hand , in the fluctuation driven case",
    "the variability is high for any considered pulse width and system size ( cv @xmath169 ) .",
    "however , a different picture arises when studying the stability of infinitesimal perturbations : the system is chaotic for slow synapses and it becomes stable for sufficiently fast synaptic times ( @xmath170 ms ) .",
    "furthermore , a chaotic state for the inhibitory network is observable already at small connectivity @xmath171 contradicting what reported in  @xcite , where the authors affirmed that a large connectivity is a prerequisite to observe chaotic motion in these models .",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath61 tends towards an asymptotic value for increasing system sizes with a power - law scaling . the exponent @xmath125 associated to this scaling is different in the current ( fluctuation ) driven case , in particular @xmath172 ( @xmath173 )  @xcite . in the fluctuation driven",
    "situation the exponent is the same in the chaotic and stable phases .",
    "the origin of the observed scaling demands for new theoretical analysis , similar to the one developed for spatio - temporal chaotic systems  @xcite .",
    "quite astonishingly even in the linearly stable regime an erratic evolution of the network is observable .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been already observed in several systems ranging from diffusively coupled chaotic maps to neural networks , and it has been identified as stable chaos  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "finite amplitude perturbations are responsible for the erratic behavior observed in the system . in diffusively coupled systems",
    "this nonlinear instabilities has been characterized in terms of the propagation velocity of the information and of suitable finite size lyapunov exponents ( fsles )  @xcite .",
    "fsles have been previously employed in the context of fully coupled neural networks , where they revealed that the origin of the chaotic motion observed in two symmetrical coupled neural populations was due to collective chaos in the mean - field variables driving the single lif neurons  @xcite . in the context of randomly coupled systems",
    "the concept of propagation velocity on a lattice looses his sense , while fsles reveal serious problems in their numerical implementation .",
    "however , fsles clearly show also in our case that in the current driven case the observed instabilities have a purely linear origin , while in the fluctuation driven situation nonlinear mechanisms are present even when the system is chaotic .",
    "this analysis is confirmed by a novel indicator we have introduced , namely the local derivative @xmath83 of the averaged logarithmic distance @xmath174 between the reference and the perturbed trajectory .",
    "this quantity suffers less than the fsle the trial to trial fluctuations , since it is based on an averaged profile . for the fluctuation driven case",
    "this indicator is larger than the maximal lyapunov exponent at finite amplitudes and this effect is present for all the examined system sizes .",
    "the position of the peak in @xmath83 seems not to be particularly influenced by the system size , while the peak itself broadens towards larger amplitudes for increasing @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , all these indications can not tell us if the nonlinear mechanisms are prevailing on the linear ones , but just that the nonlinear effects are present . to measure the influence of linear versus nonlinear effects on the system dynamics , novel indicators are required , similar to linear and nonlinear information velocities for diffusively coupled systems  @xcite .    as a final point",
    "we have studied nonlinear instabilities in linearly stable systems emerging in fluctuation driven inhibitory networks for sufficiently narrow postsynaptic currents . for the characterization of these instabilities",
    "we have employed the average finite amplitude growth rate @xmath97 , measured after a finite time interval @xmath93 , analogously to what what done in  @xcite , and the probability @xmath98 that an initial perturbation induces an exponential separation between the perturbed and the reference orbits , previoulsy introduced in  @xcite .",
    "both these indicators reveal the existence of instabilities associated to finite perturbations , in particular the characteristic amplitude scales associated to these indicators vanish in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath131 . thus suggesting that instabilities in these systems can occur even for infinitesimal perturbations in clear contradiction with the fact that these systems are linearly stable at any system size , as revealed by the lyapunov analysis .",
    "this contradiction has lead monteforte & wolf to conjecture in  @xcite that the thermodynamic limit and the limit of of vanishingly small perturbations do not commute in these models .",
    "furtermore , we measure a logarithmic divergence with the system size of the peak height of @xmath97 , suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit the value of these indicator will become infinite , similarly to what found in the high connectivity limit for a binary neuronal model in the balanced state  @xcite and for lif with @xmath6-pulses in  @xcite .",
    "however , in our study the connectivity remains finite and small in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "our opinion , based on the comparison of the indicators @xmath83 and @xmath97 performed in a fluctuation driven chaotic situation , is that the above results can be due to the fact that the dynamics considered for the estimation of @xmath97 and @xmath98 do not take place on the attractor of the system .",
    "this because the indicators are estimated at short times , without allowing the perturbed dynamics to relax onto the attractor .",
