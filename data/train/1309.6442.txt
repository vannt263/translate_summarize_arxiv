    "the outstanding research results , from the recent years , in the field of heusler compounds , made the spintronics one of the emerging disciplines , which revolutionized the thriving field of information technology , especially in the context of magnetic recording @xcite . proposed by de groot et al . in 1983 , @xcite the half metallic ferromagnetism characterizes heusler materials used nowadays for spin injection devices @xcite which behave like semiconductor for one spin direction and like metal for the other spin direction , leading to a @xmath1 spin polarization of electrons , at the fermi level .",
    "apart from spintronics , heusler compounds with high spin polarization , high curie temperature and simultaneously a low saturation magnetization are suitable for ultrahigh density magnetic memory storage devices @xcite .",
    "these remarkable materials have been discovered in 1903 when fritz heusler had shown that @xmath2 alloy behaves ferromagnetically even though none of its constituent elements is magnetic @xcite .",
    "three decades later , the general crystal structure of these exciting materials was explained to be a face centered cubic structure @xcite .",
    "often described as ternary intermetallics , the family of heusler compounds includes two variants : half - heusler materials @xmath3 , with 1:1:1 composition , crystallizing in the non - centrosymmetric cubic structure @xmath4 , with @xmath5 space group and full - heusler compounds @xmath6 with 2:1:1 stoichiometry which typically crystallize in the cubic space group @xmath7 , having @xmath2 ( @xmath8 ) structure as prototype . in the particular case",
    "when the @xmath9 element is more electronegative than @xmath10 , the crystal structure observed for full - heusler compounds , has @xmath11 prototype and @xmath5 space group , often named inverse heusler structure , with @xmath10 atoms occupying the non - equivalent 4a ( 0,0,0 ) and 4c ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) wychoff positions , while @xmath9 and @xmath12 atoms being placed in 4b ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) and 4d ( 3/4,3/4,3/4 ) position , respectively @xcite .    today ,",
    "many heusler compounds @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17-based are investigated for future spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 heusler compound was observed in experimental investigations ( sem and x - ray diffraction ) , as distinct phase in the phase equilibria of ti - fe - sn ternary system @xcite , however no further studies had been performed on this compound . in the present paper , first principle calculations of the magnetic moments , density of states and bandstructure based on density functional theory",
    "are performed for the heusler compound of interest studied here , @xmath18 .",
    "the obtained results are compared with electronic structures and magnetic properties of other @xmath17 - heusler compounds analyzed in literature .",
    "self - consistent band structure calculations were performed using full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method from wien2k code @xcite .",
    "the perdew burke ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was employed for the exchange and correlation interaction .",
    "the muffin - tin radii ( @xmath19 ) considered for ti , fe and sn were 2.35 a.u .",
    ", 2.35 a.u . and 2.3 a.u .",
    "an energy threshold of -6 ry was set between the core and valence states .",
    "the number of plane waves selected was determined by the cut - off condition @xmath20 ( @xmath21 represents the maximum modulus of the reciprocal lattice vector ) . for brillouin zone ( bz ) integration",
    "a 46x46x46 mesh , containing 2456k irreducible k points was used within the modified tetrahedron method @xcite .",
    "the energy convergence criterion was @xmath22 ev and the integrated charge difference less than @xmath23 , between two successive iteration .",
    "the enthalpy of formation , calculated by subtracting the sum of the calculated equilibrium total energies for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with hcp , bcc and diamond cubic structure respectively , from the minimum of the total energy of @xmath18 compound , obtained at the equilibrium lattice parameter , is -0.76 ev / atom .",
    "this negative enthalpy of formation agrees with the successful preparation of @xmath18 phase within experimental investigations @xcite . in the phase equilibria of ti - fe - sn ternary system",
    ", the @xmath18 compound was observed in mixture with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "other identified phases were @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "decompositions of this compound , into binary or other ternary phases are possible escape routes which must be considered . therefore , the following changes in enthalpy were calculated : + @xmath34 , + @xmath35 + @xmath36 + and the positive values obtained reflect unfavorable decomposition conditions .",
    "more complicated cases could have negative changes in enthalpy , though the preparing methods can influence the arrangement of the atoms in the various sites or the persistence of metastable stoichiometries .",
    "the primitive cell of @xmath18 compound is assumed to be the cubic face centered @xmath11 prototype structure , because @xmath24 atoms are more electropositive than @xmath25 atoms @xcite . in this crystal structure ,",
    "all atoms have tetrahedral symmetry @xmath37 and no octahedral symmetry @xmath38 is adopted ( note that @xmath37 is a subgroup of @xmath38 ) .",
    "@xmath24 atoms are present in two different wyckoff positions , @xmath24 - 4c being located in ( 0.25 0.25 0.25 ) while @xmath24 - 4a in ( 0 0 0 ) , respectively , as exhibited in fig.[fig : ti2fesn ] .",
    "this is consistent with some other heusler compounds studied in literature , with @xmath10 atoms more electropositive than @xmath9 , which had been reported to exhibit inverse heusler structure ( @xmath11 prototype)@xcite .",
    "compound with @xmath11 - prototype structure . ]    the lattice parameter of @xmath18 compound is not reported in any experiment , therefore a structural optimization , within flapw scheme was performed with non - magnetic , antiferromagnetic and spin polarized ferromagnetic configurations .",
    "the unit cell of @xmath18 used for these calculations consists in a supercell resulted from spreading the crystal along the axis of @xmath39 lattice parameter .",
    "the construction of this structure was essential for antiferromagnetic configuration , in order to contain an even number of @xmath25 atoms with nearest - neighbor spins , placed at 4.483@xmath40 and oriented in opposite directions .    ]",
    "the minimum of the total energy for spin polarized configuration is lower than that for non - magnetic and antiferromagnetic cases , therefore the ferromagnetic state is further used to analyze the @xmath18 compound .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constant obtained for spin - polarized setup is 6.342 @xmath40 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : optimizareti2fesn2cel ] ) .    , @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 magnetic moments as function of lattice constant for @xmath18 compound . ]",
    "the calculated total spin magnetic moment and site resolved magnetic moments as function of lattice parameter are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magneticmomentti2fesn ] .",
    "the calculated total magnetic moment obtained is 2 @xmath41 and decreases when the lattice parameter decreases below 6.038 @xmath40 .",
    "the magnetic moment follows the new slater - pauling rule for the half - metallic ti - based , full - heusler alloys , with inverse heusler structure , recently reported by @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total spin magnetic moment per unit cell , @xmath44 , the total number of valence electrons and 18 represents the number of occupied states in the spin bands . in terms of two - orbital two - electron stabilizing interactions , within the framework of density functional theory ,",
    "the states from spin channels are occupied according to several aspects concerning ionic arguments , crystal structure of primitive cell , lattice parameter , approximations made for the exchange and correlation interaction , energy threshold set between the core and valence states and also brillouin zone integration mesh . based on ionic arguments ,",
    "the most electropositive element transfers the valence electrons to the more electronegative element .",
    "the purpose is to obtain stable closed shell ions .",
    "since @xmath24 has 1.54 pauling electronegativity , its valence atomic orbitals , formally should be depleted to fill the states of the more electronegative elements , i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( 1.83 and 1.96 pauling units ) .",
    "strongly dependent by the atomic arrangement of atoms and environment , hybridization occurs whenever the sum of metallic radii ( 12-coordinated ) of two first - neighbors exceeds the interatomic distance .",
    "considering aforementioned description of chemical bondings , the number of uncompensated electron spins is 2 , which gives the calculated total magnetic moment of @xmath18 compound .",
    "the site resolved magnetic moments calculated at the equilibrium lattice parameter are 0.718 and 1.258 @xmath41 for @xmath244c and @xmath244a atoms while -0.486 and -0.0014 @xmath41 for fe and sn , respectively . in the interstitial region ,",
    "the resulted magnetic moment is 0.509 ev .",
    "similar results were found for the @xmath45-based compounds @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the different bonding interactions between first - neighbors play a crucial role in determining the side magnetic moments of ti atoms .",
    "for example , in the semiconductor @xmath28 , the magnetic moment of ti atoms is 0 @xmath41 , while in the half metallic full - heusler @xmath46 is -0.46 @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "an inspection of the atom resolved magnetic moments reveals that the magnetic moments of @xmath24 atoms from both positions increase as the lattice expands . in spite of @xmath24 element by itself is nt magnetic , in the compound under study here , @xmath24 atoms from both positions , possess high spin magnetic moments at the optimized lattice parameter , being antiferromagnetically coupled with @xmath25 atoms .",
    "these results lead to the conclusion , that a @xmath45 heusler compound with @xmath26 yields a well - ordered and stable half - metallic ferrimagnet , similar to all full - heusler compounds , known as @xmath45 -based reported and described as ferrimagnet half - metals @xcite .",
    "other @xmath26 containing full heusler compound , @xmath17-based , which has @xmath47 atoms instead of @xmath25 as @xmath9 element , also present a band gap in the minority spin channel , but it is half - metallic ferromagnet(@xmath24 and @xmath47 atoms are ferromagnetically coupled ) , despite the nature of the first neighboring shells of @xmath9 element are similar@xcite .    the calculated total and partial density of states performed at equilibrium lattice constant",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : totaldosti2fesn ] .",
    "the majority spin channel exhibits a typical metallic behavior , while the minority spin channel , a semiconducting character with a band gap around fermi level , leading to a @xmath1 spin polarization . in both spin channels ,",
    "the significant contribution to energy between -5.5 ev and -2.5 ev comes not only from @xmath48 electrons of sn but also from @xmath49 electrons of fe atoms which have a substantial contribution also between -2.5 ev and -0.8 ev .        as fig .",
    "[ fig : gapti2fesn ] shows , the size of the gap almost no changes but the fermi level is shifted from the conduction band minimum to the center of the gap , while the lattice parameter increases .",
    "the transition from half - metallic to metallic character , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapti2fesn ] and called critical transition point , occurs at 6.038 @xmath40 when fermi level is located at the bottom of conduction band .",
    "as function of lattice parameter . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : bandti2fesn ] displays the bandstructures of @xmath18 compound illustrating the metallic behavior from majority spin channel ( spin - up band ) and the semiconducting character from minority spin channel ( spin - down band ) with the indirect band gap around the fermi level . at the equilibrium lattice",
    "constant the band gap from minority spin channel given by calculations is 0.489 ev .",
    "this value is determined by the difference in energy between the top of the valence band located at 0.329 ev below the fermi level , at @xmath50 - point , and the bottom of the conduction band , placed at 0.160 ev above the @xmath51 at @xmath52 point .     for majority spin channel ( spin - up band -left panel ) and minority spin channel ( spin - down band - right panel ) electrons for optimized structure .",
    "]    the band gap is formed not only as result of @xmath24(4a ) - @xmath24(4c ) hybridization but also due to @xmath24(4a ) - fe interaction .",
    "the double degenerated @xmath53 orbitals of @xmath24(4a ) atoms with energy values in the region corresponding to the anti - bonding states of the conduction band , couple with @xmath53 orbitals of @xmath24(4c)and @xmath25 atoms , from valence band , corresponding to the bonding states .",
    "the interaction between @xmath24(4a ) and @xmath25 is strong as well , although it is determined by the antiferromagnetic coupling between atoms .",
    "additionally , it should be mentioned that the shortest distances from the unit cell are @xmath24(4a)-@xmath24(4c ) and @xmath24(4c)-fe , with close values near to 2.745 @xmath40 .",
    "the origin of the band gap in the compound under study here is similar to the band gap calculated for @xmath54 with ( @xmath55 ) @xcite , which reported that the semiconducting gap appears as result of hybridization of the @xmath49 states between @xmath24(4a)-@xmath24(4c ) coupling and @xmath9 atoms , but somewhat different than the origin of the minority spin channel band gap from @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) @xcite where , only the covalent hybridization between low valent and high valent atoms leads to the band gap formation .",
    "this result mismatch may be due to the different calculation method used or the approximations considered .",
    "the main group element has a crucial role to influence the size of the band gap and the structural stability .",
    "hence , for @xmath18 , the energy gap from minority spin channel is larger than the one for @xmath58 ( 0.45 ev @xcite and smaller than the semiconducting gap of @xmath59 ( 0.84 ev @xcite ) . comparing with the @xmath45 compounds containing main group elements with less p- states than @xmath26 ( i.e @xmath60 , @xmath61 or @xmath62 @xcite ) ,",
    "the band gap of @xmath18 is smaller . with respect to @xmath63",
    ", further studies have to be done because two distinct gap values were reported : 0.53 ev @xcite and 0.33 ev @xcite .",
    "a novel heusler compound , @xmath18 has been studied by using first - principles fplapw calculation method .",
    "the analysis of electronic structure and magnetic properties in the bulk , confirms that @xmath18 follows the new slater - pauling rule for the half - ferromagnetic full heusler alloys , with inverse heusler structure .",
    "the calculated total magnetic moment found is 2 @xmath41 and decreases for a lattice parameter lower than 6.038 @xmath40 .",
    "the majority spin channel presents metallic character , while the minority spin channel is semiconducting with a band gap of 0.489 ev , at the equilibrium lattice constant 6.342 @xmath40 .",
    "overall , the relative low magnetic moment and high spin polarization make @xmath18 heusler compound attractive in spin torque transfer magnetic random access memory devices .",
