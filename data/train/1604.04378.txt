    "semantic matching is a critical task for many applications in natural language processing , including information retrieval , question answering and paraphrase identification @xcite .",
    "the target of semantic matching is to determine a matching score for two given texts .",
    "taking the task of question answering as an example , given a pair of question and answer , a matching function is created to determine the matching degree between these two texts .",
    "traditional methods such as bm25 and feature based learning models usually rely on exact matching patterns to determine the degree , and thus suffer from the vocabulary mismatching problem @xcite .",
    "recently , deep learning approach has been applied to this area and well tackled the vocabulary mismatching problem . some existing work focus on representing each text as one or several dense vectors , and",
    "then calculate the matching score based on the similarity between these vectors .",
    "examples include rae @xcite , dssm  @xcite , cdssm  @xcite , arc - i  @xcite , cntn  @xcite , lstm - rnn  @xcite , multigrancnn  @xcite and mv - lstm  @xcite . however , it is usually difficult for these methods to model the complicated interaction relationship between two texts @xcite because the representations are calculated independently . to address the problem ,",
    "some other deep methods have been proposed to directly learn the interaction relationship between the two texts , including deepmatch  @xcite , arc - ii  @xcite , and matchpyramid  @xcite etc .",
    "all these models conducts the matching through a hierarchical matching structure : the global interaction between two texts is a composition of different levels of the local interactions , such as word level and phrase level interactions .    in all of these methods ,",
    "the mechanism on the generation of the complicated interaction relationship between two texts is not clear , and thus lack of interpretability . in this paper",
    ", we propose to tackle the problem in a recursive manner .",
    "specifically , we view the generation of the global interactions as a recursive process . given two texts @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the interaction at each position @xmath2 ( i.e.  interaction between @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] ) is a composition of the interactions between their prefixes ( i.e.  three interactions , @xmath5\\!{\\sim}\\ !",
    "s_2[1{:}j]$ ] , @xmath3\\!{\\sim}\\ ! s_2[1{:}j{-}1]$ ] , @xmath5{\\sim } s_2[1{:}j{-}1]$ ] ) , and the word level interaction at this position ( i.e.  the interaction between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 $ ] stands for the prefix consisting of the previous @xmath9 words of text @xmath10 . compared with previous hierarchical matching structure , the recursive matching structure can not only capture the interactions between nearby words , but also take the long distant interactions into account .",
    "based on the above idea , we propose a novel deep architecture , namely match - srnn , to model the recursive matching structure .",
    "firstly , a similarity tensor is constructed to capture the word level interactions between two texts , where each element @xmath11 stands for a similarity vector between two words from different texts . then a spatial ( 2d ) recurrent neural network ( spatial rnn ) with gated recurrent units",
    "is applied to the tensor .",
    "specifically , the representation at each position @xmath12 can be viewed as the interactions between the two prefixes , i.e.  @xmath13}$ ] and @xmath14}$ ] .",
    "it is determined by four factors : @xmath15 and the input word level interaction @xmath11 , depending on the corresponding gates , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "finally , the matching score is produced by a linear scoring function on the representation of the global interaction @xmath18 , obtained by the aforementioned spatial rnn .",
    "we show that match - srnn can well approximate the dynamic programming process of longest common subsequence ( lcs ) problem  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our simulation experiments show that a clear matching path can be obtained by backtracking the maximum gates at each position , similar to that in lcs .",
    "thus , there is a clear interpretation on how the global interaction is generated in match - srnn .",
    "we conducted experiments on question answering and paper citation tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our model .",
    "the experimental results showed that match - srnn can significantly outperform existing deep models .",
    "moreover , to visualize the learned matching structure , we showed the matching path of two texts sampled from the real data .",
    "the contributions of this paper can be summarized as :    * the idea of modeling the mechanism of semantic matching recursively , i.e.  the recursive matching structure . * the proposal of a new deep architecture , namely match - srnn , to model the recursive matching structure .",
    "experimental results showed that match - srnn can significantly improve the performances of semantic matching , compared with existing deep models . * the reveal of the relationship between match - srnn and the lcs , i.e.  match - srnn can reproduce the matching path of lcs in an exact matching scenario .",
    "existing deep learning methods for semantic matching can be categorized into two groups .",
    "one paradigm focuses on representing each text to a dense vector , and then compute the matching score based on the similarity between these two vectors .",
    "for example , dssm  @xcite uses a multi - layer fully connected neural network to encode a query ( or a document ) as a vector .",
    "cdssm  @xcite and arc - i  @xcite utilize convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , while lstm - rnn  @xcite adopts recurrent neural network with long short term memory ( lstm ) units to better represent a sentence .",
    "different from above work , cntn  @xcite uses a neural tensor network to model the interaction between two sentences instead of using the cosine function . with this way , it can capture more complex matching relations .",
    "some methods even try to match two sentences with multiple representations , such as words , phrases , and sentences level representations .",
    "examples include rae  @xcite , bicnn  @xcite , multigrancnn  @xcite , and mv - lstm  @xcite . in general ,",
    "the idea behind the approach is consistent with users experience that the matching degree between two sentences can be determined once the meanings of them being well captured .",
    "however , it is usually difficult for these methods to model the complicated interaction relationship between two texts , especially when they have already been represented as a compact vector  @xcite .",
    "the other paradigm turns to directly model the interaction relationship of two texts .",
    "specifically , the interaction is represented as a dense vector , and then the matching score can be produced by integrating such interaction .",
    "most existing work of this paradigm create a hierarchical matching structure , i.e.  the global interaction between two texts is generated by compositing the local interactions hierarchically .",
    "for example , deepmatch  @xcite models the generation of the global interaction between two texts as integrating local interactions based on hierarchies of the topics . matchpyramid  @xcite uses a cnn to model the generation of the global interaction as an abstraction of the word level and phrase level interactions .",
    "defining the matching structure hierarchically has limitations , since hierarchical matching structure usually relies on a fixed window size for composition , the long distant dependency between the local interactions can not be well captured in this kind of models .",
    "in all existing methods , the mechanism of semantic matching is complicated and hard to interpret . in mathematics and computer science ,",
    "when facing a complicated object , a common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type , and try to solve the problems recursively .",
    "this is the well - known thinking of recursion . in this paper",
    ", we propose to tackle the semantic matching problem recursively .",
    "the recursive rule is defined as follows .",
    "given two texts @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the interaction between prefixes @xmath3{=}\\{w_1,\\cdots , w_i\\}$ ] and @xmath4{=}\\{v_1,\\cdots , v_j\\}$ ] ( denoted as @xmath12 ) is composited by the interactions between the sub - prefixes as well as the word level interaction of the current position , as shown by the following equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the interaction between words @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] illustrates an example of the recursive matching structure for sentences @xmath23 and @xmath24 . considering the interaction between @xmath25{=}\\{\\text{\\em the cat sat}\\}}$ ] and",
    "@xmath26{=}\\{\\text{\\em the dog played balls}\\}}$ ] ( i.e.  @xmath27 ) , the recursive matching structure defined above indicates that it is the composition of the interactions between their prefixes ( i.e.  @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) and the word level interaction between ` _ sat _ ' and ` _ balls _ ' , where @xmath28 stands for the interaction between @xmath31{=}\\{\\text{\\em the cat}\\}$ ] and @xmath32{=}\\{\\text{\\em the dog played balls}\\}$ ] , @xmath29 denotes the interaction between @xmath25{=}\\{\\text{\\em the cat sat}\\}}$ ] and @xmath33{=}\\{\\text{\\em the dog played}\\}}$ ] , and @xmath30 denotes the interaction between @xmath34{=}\\{\\text{\\em the cat}\\}}$ ] and @xmath33{=}\\{\\text{\\em the dog played}\\}}$ ] .",
    "we can see that the most important interaction , i.e. the interaction between @xmath35{=}\\{\\text{\\em the cat sat}\\}$ ] and @xmath36{=}\\{\\text{\\em the dog played}\\}$ ] , has been utilized for representing @xmath27 , which consists well with the human understanding .",
    "therefore , it is expected that this recursive matching structure can well capture the complicated interaction relationship between two texts because all of the interactions between prefixes have been taken into consideration .",
    "compared with the hierarchical one , the recursive matching structure is able to capture long - distant dependency among interactions .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new deep architecture , namely match - srnn , to model the recursive matching structure . as shown in figure  [ fig : architecture ] , match - srnn consists of three components : ( 1 ) a neural tensor network to capture the word level interactions ; ( 2 ) a spatial rnn applied on the word interaction tensor to obtain the global interaction ; ( 3 ) a linear scoring function to obtain the final matching score .      in match - srnn",
    ", a neural tensor network is first utilized to capture the basic interactions between two texts , i.e.  word level interactions .",
    "specifically , each word is first represented as a distributed vector .",
    "given any two words @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and their vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the interaction between them can be represented as a vector : @xmath39}u(v_j)+w\\begin{bmatrix }          u(w_i)\\\\          u(v_j )      \\end{bmatrix}+\\vec{b}),\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] is one slice of the tensor parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are parameters of the linear part .",
    "@xmath43 is a non - linear function , and we use rectifier @xmath44 in this paper .    the interaction can also be represented as a similarity score , such as cosine .",
    "we adopt neural tensor network here because it can capture more complicated interactions @xcite .",
    "the second step of match - srnn is to apply a spatial rnn to the word level interaction tensor .",
    "spatial rnn , also referred to as two dimensional rnn ( 2d - rnn ) , is a special case of multi - dimensional rnn @xcite . according to spatial rnn , given the representations of interactions between prefixes @xmath5\\!{\\sim}\\ !",
    "s_2[1{:}j]$ ] , @xmath3\\!{\\sim}\\ !",
    "s_2[1{:}j{-}1]$ ] and @xmath5\\!{\\sim}\\ ! s_2[1{:}j{-}1]$ ] , denoted as @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively , the interaction between prefixes @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] can be represented as follows : @xmath47 therefore we can see that spatial rnn can naturally model the recursive matching structure defined in equation  ( [ eq : recursivematchstruct ] ) .    for function @xmath48 , we have different choices .",
    "the basic rnn usually uses a non - linear full connection layer as @xmath48 .",
    "this type of function is easy for computing while often suffers from the gradient vanishing and exploding problem  @xcite .",
    "therefore , many variants of rnn has been proposed , such as long short term memory ( lstm ) @xcite , gated recurrent units ( gru )  @xcite and grid lstm  @xcite . here , we adopt gru since it is easy to implement and has close relationship with lcs as discussed in the following sections .",
    "gru is proposed to utilize several gates to tackle the aforementioned problems of basic rnn , and has shown excellent performance for tasks such as machine translation @xcite . in this paper , we extend traditional gru for sequences ( 1d - gru ) to spatial gru .",
    "figure  [ fig : gru ] describes clearly about the extensions .    for 1d - gru ,",
    "given a sentence @xmath49 , where @xmath50 stands for the embedding of the @xmath51-th words , the representation of position @xmath51 , i.e.  @xmath52 , can be computed as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the representation of position @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the parameters , @xmath58 is the updating gate which tries to control whether to propagate the old information to the new states or to write the new generated information to the states , and @xmath59 is the reset gate which tries to reset the information stored in the cells when generating new candidate hidden states .    when extending to spatial gru , context information will come from three directions for a given position @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath60 and @xmath61 , therefore , we will have four updating gates @xmath58 , denoted as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and three reset gates @xmath59 , denoted as @xmath64",

    "<S> semantic matching , which aims to determine the matching degree between two texts , is a fundamental problem for many nlp applications . </S>",
    "<S> recently , deep learning approach has been applied to this problem and significant improvements have been achieved . in this paper , we propose to view the generation of the global interaction between two texts as a recursive process : i.e.  the interaction of two texts at each position is a composition of the interactions between their prefixes as well as the word level interaction at the current position . </S>",
    "<S> based on this idea , we propose a novel deep architecture , namely match - srnn , to model the recursive matching structure . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a tensor is constructed to capture the word level interactions . </S>",
    "<S> then a spatial rnn is applied to integrate the local interactions recursively , with importance determined by four types of gates . finally , the matching score is calculated based on the global interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , after degenerated to the exact matching scenario , match - srnn can approximate the dynamic programming process of longest common subsequence . thus , there exists a clear interpretation for match - srnn . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments on two semantic matching tasks showed the effectiveness of match - srnn , and its ability of visualizing the learned matching structure . </S>"
