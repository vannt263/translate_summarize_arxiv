    "quantum field theory , while being extremely successful from a phenomenological point of view , still has profound fundamental issues with its mathematical definition . it is well known @xcite that the interaction picture is inexorably ill - defined for an interacting quantum field theory , since no unitarily equivalent mapping between a `` free theory '' and an `` interacting theory '' can exist . hence , what is called a `` free particle '' in an interacting theory differs from a real `` free particle '' to an extent that any matrix elements between these two theories generally vary by infinite amounts , even in the perturbative limit .",
    "an effective way to deal with this problem is renormalization .",
    "`` fast '' degrees of freedom , with momenta @xmath1 bigger than some `` fundamental '' scale @xmath0 much larger than the typical momentum exchange between particles in a given experiment , are integrated over . for renormalizeable terms , the shifts , of order @xmath2 ,",
    "can be absorbed into parameters of a lagrangian written solely in terms of `` slow '' terms , so @xmath0 becomes physically irrelevant until such high energies that @xmath3 are reached . for non - renormalizeable theories , this can not be done .",
    "however , an effective theory power series can be defined in which @xmath4 is a small parameter .",
    "such an `` effective lagrangian '' will hopefully have only a few leading terms incorporating all the relevant quantum fluctuations .",
    "while renormalization was initially considered to be a dubious `` sweeping infinities under the carpet '' , it is now understood to be a conceptually elegant implementation of the fact that nature seems to separate energy scales ( you do not need quantum gravity to calculate the trajectory of an apple falling from a tree ! ) and therefore a consistent theory should exist where only `` relevant '' degrees of freedom are considered . while we have to live with the fact that observables at low energy can not uniquely specify the theory at high energy , the fundamental problems of qft become `` harmless '' for low energies .",
    "we can therefore hope they will be fixed a uv quantum theory of gravity@xcite which lives at @xmath5gev , safely out of reach of our current experiments .    in elementary particle experiments ,",
    "this approach is particularly effective because our observables are definite @xmath6particle scattering matrices , @xmath7 .",
    "the detector can distinguish events such as @xmath8 from , say , @xmath9 , and measure relative probabilities of such events occurring given a controlled flux of @xmath10 at definite @xmath11 .",
    "events with `` too many particles '' are forbidden by kinematics .",
    "this is not the situation for a `` macroscopic object '' , with `` many '' particles , even if the typical energy of each particle is comparatively low . a plasma ( whether in the early universe , or in heavy ion collisions )",
    ", a strong `` classical field '' , and most likely a macroscopic black hole are examples of such systems .    here , the power expansion described earlier breaks down : while each momentum @xmath12 , it is not true that @xmath13 .",
    "some care therefore is needed in applying the concepts of renormalization theory to many - particle systems .",
    "this theoretical uncertainity gives rise to some `` phenomenological puzzles '' under active investigation : perhaps the most well - known is the `` black hole information problem '' @xcite , the apparent violation of unitarity in the process of converting a `` quantum pure state '' into hawking radiation via the creation of a black hole .",
    "what makes this seem like a paradox is that , while we do not know much about the regime valid at @xmath14 , the effective field theories `` long before '' a black hole s formation and `` long after '' its evaporation , as well as on the horizon , are very well known ( they are to a good approximation , free field theories in flat space ) .",
    "while of course this problem can not be experimentally investigated , analogues of it might be accessible to experiment @xcite : hadronic collisions give rise to a `` fireball '' whose dynamics are regulated by strongly coupled qcd , whose dynamics are not understood at the quantitative level .",
    "we think , however , that the final state at @xmath15 , is very well understood as a quasi - free gas of pions and protons .",
    "indeed , entropy and other thermal concepts are readily linked to observational counting of such free degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the increase of entropy at deconfinement was thought to be a qgp signature @xcite .",
    "but this is also a unitary quantum process , whose uv theory ( qcd ) is known to be an `` ordinary '' quantum field theory .",
    "where is the negentropy@xcite canceling out the particle entropy hiding ? and does this provide a key to the more abstract black hole puzzle , as , for example , gauge / gravity duality @xcite makes us believe ? while several proposals were advanced recently to resolve these issues , no consensus exists as to in what limits does a unitary quantum process exhibit thermal - like behavior ( see for example @xcite , or the difference in interpretation between @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these notes are intended to clarify some of these issues , and discuss their implication to some problems of current research interest .",
    "we examine the general problem of describing multi - particle systems , first the well - known classical analogue , and then in a quantum field theory .",
    "we show where the scale separation problem might break down , and what effects it will have on observables , particularly the `` entropy '' , observed and modeled in the infrared regime .",
    "we finish by discussing the relevance of this discussion to concrete problems .",
    "classically , the analogue of entropy conservation is liouville s theorem @xcite : a system of @xmath16 degrees of freedom can be represented as a point in @xmath17dimensional phase space . if we start , at a certain point in time , with an `` ensemble of systems '' covering a phase space volume with a probability density function @xmath18 , this volume will be unchanged as the systems evolve in time .",
    "consider a system of @xmath16 classical particles , something that arises in situations like `` shock heating '' in hydrodynamics , or first order phase transitions in the classical limit@xcite .",
    "these are most likely irrelevant to the current work , as both in this and the next sections the effective @xmath16 is large but finite ] , interacting with a 2-particle translation invariant conservative potential @xmath19 . it can be shown @xcite that the classical s - particle liouville equation for a system of @xmath16 particles is equivalent to the equation @xmath20 @xmath21 this equation , easily generalizable to more than 2-particle potentials ( provided translational symmetry and the conservative nature of the potential is preserved ) , encodes all the evolution of an @xmath22particle distribution function defined on the ensemble of @xmath23-dimensional phase space",
    ". its exact evolution will therefore respect liouville s theorem on that space .",
    "however , for more than @xmath24 degrees of freedom , and for pretty much any bounded hamiltonian allowing for topological mixing in phase space ( i.e. , a hamiltonian free of issues like those discussed in @xcite ) , this equation s evolution will be highly chaotic : any `` neatly defined '' shape in phase space becomes more and more `` fractal '' with time ( fig .",
    "[ fractal ] ) .",
    "what this means is that more and more of the conserved phase space area becomes encoded in correlations between many particles : if one particle had a `` very small '' deviation , after a logarithmically small time another particle will get a comparable deviation . in this regime , equations such as eq .",
    "[ bbgky ] are inherently intractable@xcite .",
    "they are also useless for all practical purposes , since in any case classical mechanics is thought to be at best an approximation of quantum mechanics , where phase space can only be known by a resolution set through the uncertainity principle , @xmath25 .",
    "when `` most of the area of phase space '' is encoded in details whose characteristic structure is smaller than this measure , the exact liouville equation becomes useless to describe physical data .",
    "paradoxically , in this regime a _",
    "truncation _ of the bbgky series would do much better .",
    "the virtue of equation [ bbgky ] is that it can be thought of as an expansion in ever - decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "if cumulants and correlations above a critical @xmath27 are thought to be irrelevant ( i.e. , if we do not care about correlations between more fundamental degrees of freedom than @xmath28 ) , eq .",
    "[ bbgky ] can be truncated into a system of @xmath27 non - linear differential equations .",
    "if at @xmath29 one assumes @xmath30 ( or some more complicated factorization in terms of @xmath31 with @xmath32 ) .",
    "the `` noise coefficient '' @xmath33 can be shown to be related , in a semi - classical picture , to the quantum mechanical scattering cross - sections @xcite . for instance , in the boltzmann equation @xmath34 .",
    "the kadanoff - baym equation @xcite can also be viewed as a higher - order extension of this approach .",
    "one does not , however , expect such a system to obey liouville s theorem and conserve phase space in its classical evolution . indeed , molecular chaos ( truncating the bbgky hierarchy at @xmath35 ) straight - forwardly leads to the boltzmann h - theorem , showing entropy to be increasing @xcite .",
    "while the exact derivation of such equations from quantum mechanics is still subject to some dispute , no one talks about the generation of entropy in truncated bbgky systems as a paradox .",
    "the increase of entropy is an artifact of the fact that any bbgky truncation destroys inter - particle correlations .",
    "the observability of such correlations , certainly in practice and even in principle , is dubious to impossible .",
    "hence , for `` all practical purposes '' liouville s theorem ceases to apply and systems of many interacting particles generally thermalize .",
    "classical physics is now considered to be an `` effective theory '' of quantum theory , valid for when the `` total action '' @xmath36 .",
    "yet it is in exactly this limit , when the number of degrees of freedom @xmath37 , that unitarity theorems that are exact both at the classical and quantum level ( liouville s theorem , quantum mechanically , is represented by unitarity ) are violated .",
    "a natural conclusion is that , in this limit , the effective expansion breaks down , even when the scale separation between the effective and fundamental theories is large . in the rest of this work we shall argue this is indeed the case .",
    "the discussion in the previous section becomes a bit more subtle when a _",
    "relativistic quantum field theory _ rather than a simple _ many particle system _ is considered .",
    "in such a theory _ any system _ is a system of infinitely many off - shell particles , with the fock space taking place of a hilbert space .    given a lagrangian @xcite , for example a @xmath38 lagrangian , ( the simplest lagrangian of scalar particles , not carrying any conserved quantum numbers )",
    ", one can define a `` bare '' action , @xmath39 when this action is inserted into the quantum partition function of the theory @xmath40\\ ] ] and correlation functions @xmath41 are calculated beyond tree level , one finds that for @xmath38 theory and for all interacting quantum field theories in four dimensions yields divergences appear .",
    "the reason is that arbitrarily high momentum quantum fluctuations are allowed . ultimately , these divergences express the fact that arbitrary small differences between free and interacting theories yield infinite differences in observables @xcite .",
    "the infrared behavior of this theory can however be regularized against some ultraviolet cutoff scale , by performing truncations of some sort .",
    "what this means in practice is that the quantum partition function of the theory is only sampled `` on a lattice '' of resolution below critical value @xmath42 .",

    "in addition , in renormalizeable interactions ( such as the @xmath38 example ) all residual dependence on @xmath0 can be hidden in a redefinition of parameters @xmath50 ( in fact the exact form of the scale separator in eq .",
    "[ separation ] becomes irrelevant ) .",
    "the exact form of the equation describing the dependence of the lagrangian parameters on the scale can be rigorously calculated in perturbation theory @xcite and non - perturbatively @xcite by , essentially , turning eq .",
    "[ zj ] around into a differential equation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath0 . in general , for an action @xmath51 of many fields @xmath52 valid for a scale @xmath0 , this equation will be of the form @xcite @xmath53 while correlation functions , @xmath7 , in turn , obey their local evolution equation which can be derived by differentiating eq .",
    "[ zj ] @xmath54 the parameters for these evolution equations are @xmath55 , some smearing function encoding the renormalization scheme @xcite ( it must vanish at @xmath56 and diverge at @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 are , respectively , the running of the coupling constant and scaling exponent .",
    "the latter are related to the change in the effective action , and the number of degrees of freedom lost when an interval @xmath59 is traced over .",
    "what distinguishes renormalizable from non - renormalizable interactions is their asymptotic behavior as @xmath60 . while renormalizeable interactions can exhibit a fixed point ( which can be used to define an infrared theory independent of @xmath0 )",
    ", non - renormalizeable interactions ( for example @xmath61 ) will typically come with factors of @xmath62 ( this is clear from dimensional reasons ) , and hence will be invisible in the far infra - red .",
    "if @xmath0 is a large but finite number ( we expect the planck energy @xmath14 to function as a physical @xmath0 for all quantum field theories ) , then , while renormalizeable terms dominate , we can not automatically neglect non - renormalizeable `` irrelevant '' terms .",
    "however , if the average momentum exchange @xmath63 , @xmath64 continues to be a good expansion parameter which will allow us to define an `` effective lagrangian '' to a desired order in @xmath0 .",
    "hadronic theory with @xmath65 , and gravity at @xmath66 can be thought of as effective theories of this kind .",
    "the distinction between renormalizeable and non - renormalizeable theories will play a secondary importance in the rest of this work , for we shall assume there is a physical cutoff scale , much higher than @xmath67 , distinguishing the `` fundamental '' and the `` effective '' theory .",
    "the above approach is useful if we have boundary conditions where the `` initial and final particle numbers '' are well - defined , and initial and final states can be prepared to be asymptotically well - defined .",
    "an example are the textbook scattering problems . more generally , due to energy conservation ,",
    "any system where the total energy @xmath49 can be expanded into a tractable sum of matrix coefficients @xmath7 , which can be calculated by systematically differentiating eq .",
    "[ zj ] ( the shift @xmath68 will not matter in derivatives ) .",
    "let us , however , consider a system with a `` large number '' @xmath16 of particles , each with energy @xmath12 , but where @xmath69 , and an experiment which can not distinguish all particle final states with infinite precision ( because , for example , it has no access to the required number of `` identically prepared systems '' ) .",
    "an example of such a system is a thermalizing qgp started by the collision of a large nucleus .",
    "another example , most likely , is a macroscopic black hole that forms and evaporates according to semiclassical emission of hawking radiation .",
    "unless we consider a dilute system in a perturbative theory , sequential scattering can not be a priori assumed , and degrees of freedom are not on - shell momentum eigenstates of a well - defined number of particles .    in this regime",
    ", we can not anymore automatically assume that the @xmath70 will produce a hierarchy of scales between the fundamental and the effective theory .",
    "in the infinite volume thermodynamic limit @xmath71 , indeed , we can not automatically assume that the renormalizeable terms dominate over the irrelevant ones .",
    "we can , however , still use @xmath7 to construct a _",
    "density matrix _ for the system and see how it evolves .",
    "of course , we are talking about a fock space , where every degree of freedom is bounded by the `` microscopic scale '' @xmath0 .",
    "the total energy is however @xmath72 .",
    "the density matrix is , therefore , @xmath73 and the standard functional integral and , for a perturbative theory , feynman diagrams techniques can be used to calculate the matrix elements @xmath74 ( they are related to the appropriate scattering matrix elements ) .",
    "note that the density matrix contains information about all the degrees of freedom of the system , _ and their quantum correlations _",
    ", each of which has its own evolution equation of type eq .",
    "[ evolreno ] .",
    "consider , furthermore , a situation where our experiment can only measure final state momentum eigsenstates and s - matrices ( all experiments discussed in section [ secdiscussion ] are of this kind ) . because of the infinities pointed out in @xcite",
    "such detectors will therefore be very lousy density matrix measurers , because the number of correlations they can pick up is maximum @xmath75 ( for realistic experiments @xcite , it is really @xmath76 , something we will elaborate in section [ secdiscussion ] ) , and , for an eft with a `` high '' cutoff @xmath77 , they will miss all correlations where virtuality plays a part ( as final state particles with sizeable virtuality corrections will be moving at near lightspeed ) .    for a system with total energy @xmath78 , therefore ,",
    "even an `` ideal experiment '' , capable of measuring correlations of an arbitrary high number of particles , will only measure as many @xmath79 in eq .",
    "[ densmat ] as kinematics allows given the total system energy , an infinitesimal fraction of the possible ones .",
    "`` collective observables '' , such as entropy .",
    "a `` state '' can likewise be interpreted in a `` frequentist '' and `` bayesian '' way , and the density matrix is the quantum analogue of the phase space distribution function mentioned in section [ secclassical ] ] @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the probability coefficients for the system to be in each eigenstate , will likewise be incompletely sampled , so even the entropy of a `` pure state '' will not be found to be zero .",

    "[ entropydef ] even for infinite multiplicity events sampled through infinite ensembles of identically prepared systems , where an @xmath84 limit is experimentally realistic .",
    "this experimental ambiguity is complemented by a problem of describing @xmath85 within effective theory : since an effective field theory does not describe _ every _ correlation of the uv theory , it will not describe the entropy well . in this case , even ideal experiments will not yield results that the `` effective theorist '' can interpret as a pure density matrix ( carrying zero entropy ) , because , as shown in @xcite , the density matrices of the two theories are incommensurable .",
    "the ambiguity of the definition of entropy can be naturally understood from the fact that , in quantum mechanics , entropy conservation follows from unitarity @xcite .",
    "for both normalizeable and non - renormalizeable theories , eqs [ evolrenoaction ] and [ evolreno ] do not specify unitarity , which must be fixed , order by order in perturbation theory , via field strength renormalization @xcite .",
    "we should not expect , therefore , eq . [ entropydef ] to be a conserved quantity for a theory where degrees of freedom are truncated and traced over .",

    "[ densmat ] will give an entropy of @xmath87 .",
    "as we will argue , as the number of correlations goes up the ability of effective field theories to describe them rapidly decreases .",
    "we can make these considerations a bit more quantitative using the subadditivity constraints @xcite : if we denote the entropy of `` slow degrees of freedom '' by @xmath88 and the entropy of the `` fast degrees of freedom '' by @xmath89 , then in general correlations between the slow degrees of freedom and the fast degrees of freedom account for a negentropy @xmath90 , always bounded by @xmath91 let us assume the `` fundamental '' theory is in a pure state , so @xmath92 , but the correlations are hidden predominantly in the `` fast degrees of freedom '' , @xmath93 .",

    "furthermore , in a basis where eq .",
    "[ rhofree ] is diagonal , eq .",
    "[ rhoint ] will not be , since interactions mix terms of different momentum ( @xmath113 in eq .",

    "the crucial question is , how important are the interactions not captured by the effective theory , i.e. what fraction of the @xmath121 terms are actually relevant ?",
    "if the fundamental theory at @xmath0 is strongly coupled , we can reasonably suppose that the classical analogue of the system at @xmath0 is chaotic .",
    "we can then further our insight by applying the berry conjecture @xcite , stating _ wavefunctions of high - lying energy levels of classically chaotic systems are pseudo - random functions_. while this conjecture has never been extended beyond quantum mechanics , we feel confident using it because of the truncation in @xmath0 . in this case",

    "in other words , if only the terms in eq . [ rhofree ]",

    "the condition for interactions mixing ir and uv degrees of freedom `` in the infrared '' is simply that such interactions are kinematically allowed , i.e. that the total size of the system is of the order as the ultraviolet scale .",
    "the above reasoning is based on the density matrix , and hence is valid independently from whether the system in question starts out in a pure state with zero entropy , or is close to equilibrium . in the next section ,",

    "the condensed - matter systems in question , however , have to important differences w.r.t .",
    "the generic setups described in the previous section : the first difference is the fact that such systems are very close to the ground state , with @xmath176 and most of the relativistic energy stored in mass density rather than in excitations . as berry s conjecture only applies to `` highly excited '' states @xcite , where effects of the energy gap are negligible , we can not assume the density matrices of such systems are `` random '' rather than dominated by low - level excitations . if , in addition to the vacuum , one has excited only `` a few '' degrees of freedom , and one keeps track of both incoming and outgoing goldstones , then the energy gaps ( as well as the fermi surface , in the fermionic system ) protects the unitarity of the excited degrees of freedom s evolution . in this case , the situation is similar to the `` elementary scattering '' with @xmath143 , where no `` extensive scale '' @xmath78 exists and the density matrix only has a few elements , all `` slow '' .",
    "what happens , however , when `` many '' phonons or magnons , forming a `` large system '' of total energy @xmath78 ( which , for a condensed matter system , might be the inverse of the molecular size ) are excited ?    in this case , it must also be kept in mind that the typical condensed matter system described well by such an effective quantum theory @xcite is characterized by the presence of a condensate ( generically denoted here by @xmath177 , spontaneusly breaking a symmetry of the system ( respectively , the global phase of the condensate in a superfluid , electromagnetic @xmath178 for cooper pairs and rotational invariance for magnetized materials ) .",
    "the effective theory which works so well is , indeed , a theory of goldstone bosons ( phonons and magnons ) for the broken symmetry .    in this case",
    ", the basic hyerarchy of scales described in section [ secdensmat ] becomes more complicated , as the condensate enters as an additional scale , both intensive and extensive , to be dealth with . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a theory with a condensate @xmath179 , carrying energy density @xmath180 and admitting goldstone excitations @xmath181 .",
    "let us , as in sections [ secdensmat ] and [ secdyn ] put this sytem in a volume @xmath182 , and energy density @xmath183 ( mean momentum exchange @xmath184 ) .",
    "the spectral density of such a generic theory is shown in fig .",
    "[ goldstone ] .    while it is tempting to treat @xmath185 as the @xmath0 discussed in sections [ secdensmat ] and [ secdyn ] , destroying the condensate over a large volume @xmath182 requires an energy @xmath186 . for",

    "if we only see a subset of excitations of an entire system up to an energy @xmath0 , so a hyerarchy @xmath188 holds , we might well see a `` plasma of goldstone bosons '' ( a liquid of phonons within a superfluid ) , thermalizing within the condensate in a timescale as a function of @xmath189 , as described by section [ secdyn ] . in this case , if the goldstones are `` strongly interacting enough '' , the coefficients of the density matrix @xmath85 will indeed be close to random , but the basis vectors characterizing the density matrix will be eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian , as the condensate will ensure the `` uv '' degrees of freedom are unoccupied .    to summarize , the density matrices in different regimes will be @xmath190 where the @xmath191 are the uv symmetry - restored degrees of freedom . as long as @xmath192 , mixings between symmetry - broken and symmetry restored states are kinematically not allowed , and hence the ir theory will appear unitary .",
    "the `` tracing over '' of goldstone degrees of freedom @xmath193 , and randomization of @xmath194 through reactions such as those in section [ secdyn ] is however possible .",
    "thus , while it is plausible that bringing @xmath0 close to @xmath195 will make the theory more strongly interacting as the symmetry is being restored , thermalization should not uniquely signal a change in degrees of freedom within the system .",
    "looking at eqs [ rhoint ] and [ rhofree ] , one can see that an alternative way to improve the performance of eft in entropy calculation , without raising @xmath0 , is to increase the microscopically distinguishable number of degrees of freedom , while , at the same time , decreasing the probability of two distinguishable degrees of freedom entangling . in this limit , the entropy content in eq .",

    "thus , we expect that the effects described here can not be captured in `` planar expansions '' , where the classical approximation continues to describe the evolution of the density function well .",
    "in addition , specifically for the ads / cft correspondence @xcite it is worth noting that in ads space the @xmath205 scale invoked previously for freezeout is actually infinite : black holes in ads are stable @xcite , so , by the arguments described here , density matrices in a black hole background are `` as random as they can be '' for any value of the coupling . in the dual picture ,",
    "the effect of running of any renormalizeable parameters vanishes ( terms such as fig .",

    "strong hints that the planar limit @xmath206 sym is integrable @xcite , yet , unlike classical integrable systems @xcite , exhibits a finite viscosity@xcite - matrix does not capture _ all _ dynamics of operators , but only its asymptotic part .",
    "it is therefore not so clear that , analogously to classical systems , `` integrable '' quantum systems do not thermalize ; semiclassically , the molecular chaos assumption is only valid at distances parametrically larger than the microscopic scale @xcite ] and thermalization time @xcite , reinforce this supposition .",
    "it is at first sight puzzling that an `` integrable '' zero temperature theory can thermalize , the process dual to the formation of a black hole from an initial distribution in ads space of a large ( w.r.t .",

    ", these operators will manifest themselves as a loss of unitarity , to reflect the flow of information across the cutoff . in the concluding section we examine possible `` phenomenological '' consequences of these effects .",
    "let us consider a `` scattering '' where a strongly interacting and dense system ( intensive scale @xmath2 , with a global energy @xmath78 ) is produced from a pure state , but then expands and decays into a `` many''-particle system of typical momenta @xmath70 ( hence , there will be @xmath208 particles at the end ) .",
    "a good example of this is an expanding and hadronizing quark - gluon plasma , but any `` large bag of particles '' will do .",
    "crucially , a black hole of mass @xmath209 gev formed from a `` pure '' quantum state and evaporating should also fall into this category .",
    "the crucial question is : to what extent can an eft , valid for @xmath49 , be used to describe the final state of the system .",
    "as the previous sections argued , if the system is strongly interacting ( as in quantum gravity at momentum scales @xmath210 gev , or qcd with momentum scales @xmath211 mev ) , or even a weakly coupled theory where the typical state occupancy number @xmath212 ( of the type studied in @xcite ) , it is natural to assume that en evolution described by eq .",

    "[ eftcoarse ] ) .",
    "such reactions are kinematically allowed , but strongly suppressed , since they require @xmath214 .    if , however , such a precision is not available , then the `` realistic detector '' will find that the original pure state produced a large amount of entropy in its evolution : the number of particles most likely increased , as the initial kinetic energy went into particle production , and the correlations which balance the increased number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath215 negative entropy @xmath90 terms in eq .",
    "[ ineq ] ) are invisible to the detector .",
    "this increase in entropy will be interpreted by the `` effective theorist '' , with only the effective field theory at their disposal , as a violation of unitarity , for such a theorist can only calculate correlations of up to @xmath216 particles reliably .",
    "the `` fundamental theorist '' , with access to the full strongly interacting fundamental theory will be able to predict , from fundamental theory and particle averages , the necessary @xmath22particle correlations which will , to a good approximation , restore unitarity .",
    "an `` ideal detector '' , capable of measuring correlations between @xmath213 produced particles , will however be necessary to verify these predictions .",
    "the near - thermal particle distributions observed so far in _ all _ hadronic collisions are therefore natural , for realistic experiments are very far away from the `` ideal detector '' limit described above .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that , as known for a long time , thermal model describe very well a closed quantum system such as a hadronic collision , even for systems much smaller than those where kinetic thermalization is required  @xcite , as long as the observables considered are final - state particle averages .",
    "the distinction between `` fake thermalization '' and `` real thermalization '' , if such a thing is meaningful , however , requires measuring higher and higher particle momentum distribution cumulants and comparing them to statistical mechanics expectations .",
    "we do not know how realistic is such a program .",
    "measurements of this type have been performed for other reasons in the past @xcite , but for obvious reasons they fall far short of the `` ideal detector '' standard described above .",
    "note that to reach the conclusions above we just needed to assume that the final state is described by an eft ( the typical momentum is @xmath49 ) , but the system itself is `` large '' w.r.t . @xmath0 and exhibits a `` strongly interacting '' phase .",
    "the above discussion , from an eft point of view , is therefore similar to the `` scattering '' of a pure quantum system into a black hole , which eventually evaporates into hawking radiation : general relativity , coupled to quantum field theory , can be considered as an effective field theory to a hitherto unknown uv - complete quantum theory of gravity , which is relevant for momentum exchanges of order @xmath14 gev .",
    "the black hole evaporation process , similar to its sonic counterpart @xcite and the schwinger pair production mechanism in a strong field @xcite , is a semiclassical but non - perturbative process involving an `` infinite '' ( @xmath217 ) number of ingoing and outgoing states .",
    "infinite , here , simply means that backreaction of evaporated particles on the parent system can safely be neglected .",
    "semiclassical means that quantum fluctuations around the action extremum can be neglected .",

    "[ bhdiagram ] top panel summarizes the situation of a black hole formed by a coherent quantum state which evaporates into a `` many '' particle system .",
    "we are bothered by a `` black hole information paradox '' due to our conviction that , even though we lack a uv - complete theory of quantum gravity , the _ effective theory _ of quantum gravity relevant to an evaporating black hole is quantum field theory on a schwarzchild background .",
    "the effective theory before and after the black hole exists is , of course , the same quantum field theory on a flat background .",
    "corrections to these efts will necessarily come in factors of @xmath222 and lower .",
    "the essence of the `` black hole information problem '' is that we believe that we can calculate all observables using only the eft .",

    "if the theory of gravity that holds close to the singularity is strongly coupled , as dimensional analysis suggests , the overwhelming fraction of the entropy needs terms at order @xmath225 to be calculated .",
    "even if this theory is not strongly coupled , the time required for the black hole to emit most of its entropy @xmath226 , so plenty of time should be available for correlations between many many hawking radiation particles to form .",

    "for average occupation numbers such terms are suppressed , but not for high - order correlations . asking `` where the entropy is '' with only the effective theory at our disposal , therefore , is somewhat analogous to asking why the coupling constant of qed runs without having computed a single qed loop diagram , or to take a more everyday example , cooling hot vapor down to ice , and asking why one can not describe the entropy of the system by an effective theory of phonons propagating in ice . in all these cases , we simply are not using the tools capable of addressing the problem .",

    ", the resolution of the firewall paradox pointed out in @xcite might well be that assumption ( ii ) ( as in the abstract of @xcite ) is invalid .",
    "an eft of n - particle correlations is not expected to conserve unitarity in the ir because entanglement of many final - state particles is only visible beyond the 1-particle eft currently at our disposal .",
    "these particles could have been emitted at any time during the black hole evaporation , before or after the absorption of an entangled pair , and still contribute to the correlations balancing the negentropy measured `` long after '' the black hole in question evaporated @xcite .",
    "an infalling `` classical '' observer will most likely not see anything special happening at the horizon because , by definition , such a `` classical observer '' does not contain many entangled quantum particles ; as the previous section shows , a correlated quantum pair , of the type examined in works such as @xcite might well get its entanglement entropy transferred into very complicated correlations of @xmath75 particles .",
    "conversely , if the observer is some sort of quantum computer with @xmath229 entangled particles , and is governed by dynamics where such many - particle correlations quickly cascade into 1-particle correlations , they might be able to observe effects similar to what @xcite call a firewall .",
    "such carefully prepared , or highly non - linear systems , however , are very far from what we usually consider to be `` an observer '' .",
    "indeed , at present , it is difficult to see , even at the gedankenlevel , what kind of system would be needed to see the effects required to resolve `` firewall effect '' .",
    "our conclusion is , therefore , very similar to the one suggested in @xcite : the black hole entropy is almost entirely an entropy of entanglement , which will be encoded in complicated inter - particle correlations .",
    "this conclusion ( which , as argued by @xcite , also preserves the equivalence principle ) , is unavoidable when the problem is considered from an eft point of view .",
    "the analysis contained in this work was , by necessity , qualitative and general .",
    "we have made no attempt to describe how `` slow '' quantum dynamics and coarse - graining combine into an effective dynamics which incorporates both unitary and dissipative effects .",
    "in particular , our arguments can not as yet be used to isolate the regime where `` fast local thermalization '' can be developed into an effective coarse grained theory of thermalized `` small '' volume elements , i.e. hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "we have just guessed what the results might look like in certain limits .",
    "however , as already noted @xcite , the macroscopic gradient expansions usually used to generate effective theories ( such as hydrodynamics ) from fundamental theories have not one expansion parameter but two : one , well explored , is the `` knudsen number '' , the ratio of the mean free path to the system size .",
    "the other , the `` microscopic scale '' @xcite ( the mean particle separation @xmath230 in the boltzmann equation , @xmath231 in systems with classical gravity duals such as those described in section [ secplanar ] ) is supposed to be parametrically smaller than the mean free path , something which ensures the convergence of the bbgky expansion .",
    "the conclusions of this work are similar : the number of expansion parameters here is also not one but two : the is the coarse - graining scale , @xmath4 and the state quantum occupancy number @xmath232 , where @xmath182 is the total system volume and @xmath233 the microscopic degeneracy .",
    "if we interpret @xmath0 as the inverse mean free path , we can understand the above two scales in terms of the density matrix picture .",
    "only when @xmath234 does the effective theory converge to a boltzmann equation . if @xmath235 , as we saw , the quantum analogue of the bggky hierarchy diverges and non - trivial correlations cascade between `` microscopic '' and `` macroscopic '' degrees of freedom .",
    "a `` quantum turbulent '' fluid @xcite , or a weakly coupled plasma of the type studied in @xcite , might be examples of such systems .",
    "these phenomena are much less studied than the gradient expansion , as we are very far from having analytical tools capable of describing them .",
    "they might , however , be more appropriate for systems with a comparatively small number of degrees of freedom ( hadronic collisions , ultracold atoms ) than approaches based on either the boltzmann equation or large @xmath199 expansions .    in conclusion",
    ", we have argued that effective field theories are inadequate for describing multi - particle correlations even when the `` fundamental scale '' is well - separated from the probed scale .",

    "<S> we discuss the treatment , in an effective field theory , of multi - particle correlations within a `` large '' system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the act of coarse - graining necessarily introduces violations of unitarity in the evolution of states where the particle number is not defined . for an interacting system , such unitarity violations can cascade from the ultraviolet scale to the infrared in a `` short '' time . </S>",
    "<S> hence , an effective field theory will be grossly inadequate for describing multi - particle correlations and related observables , even far away from the fundamental scale @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore argue that if the system is strongly coupled at @xmath0 , than its final state _ in the effective field theory _ ( eft ) will appear as the highest entropy state if only low cumulants and correlations of the eft degrees of freedom are measured . </S>",
    "<S> heuristically , this can serve as an explanation of how `` entropy '' is created in a microscopically unitary evolution of a quantum field theory ( qft ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by discussing how these considerations might provide a clue to the apparent thermalization in a hadronic collision even in comparatively small systems , as well as the so - called black hole information paradox ; we argue the `` paradoxes '' are likely to be artifacts of using an effective theory beyond its domain of validity . </S>"
