    "the development of tools to prepare , manipulate and measure the quantum state of a physical system represents one of the great challenges of modern science and , in particular , it is essential for applications in quantum information processing such as quantum computing . at present",
    "a few systems have been identified that should permit quantum computation : molecules in the context of nmr @xcite , ion - traps @xcite , cavity qed with photons and atoms @xcite , solid state devices such as quantum dots @xcite , and trapped neutral atoms @xcite . for rydberg atoms in high q cavities",
    "the engineering of entangled states and the implementation of quantum logic have been demonstrated @xcite , furthermore a quantum gate has been performed between the internal and external degrees of freedom of an ion in a trap @xcite . in nmr systems , quantum algorithms on a few qubits , e.g. , shor s factoring algorithm , have been reported @xcite .",
    "neutral atoms are promising candidates for quantum computing for at least two reasons : ( i ) techniques of cooling and trapping atoms are by now very well established @xcite ; and ( ii ) they are comparatively less sensitive to decoherence , e.g. , interaction with the ` classical ' environment .",
    "neutral atoms can be stored and manipulated in optical lattices @xcite , standard dipole traps @xcite , and microtraps @xcite . in particular ,",
    "magnetic @xcite and optical microtraps @xcite offer an interesting perspective for storing and manipulating arrays of atoms with the eventual possibility to scale , parallelize , and miniaturize the atom optics devices needed in quantum information processing .",
    "moreover , optical microtraps can take advantage of the fact that most of the current techniques used in atom optics and laser cooling are based on the optical manipulation of atoms @xcite .",
    "many of the requirements for the implementation of quantum computation @xcite have been recently demonstrated in optical microtraps containing @xmath0 atoms per site @xcite , e.g. , selective addressing of single trap sites , and initializing and reading - out of quantum states in each site .",
    "in addition , the possibility to store and detect single atoms in optical dipole traps has been reported @xcite .    with the demonstration of single - qubit gates being straight forward ,",
    "what remains to be experimentally demonstrated is the capability of these optical microtraps to perform two - qubit quantum gates .",
    "the most prominent examples of such gates include the cnot gate , the phase gate and the @xmath1  gate @xcite .",
    "the latter transforms states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , written in the computational basis , to maximally entangled states , while leaving @xmath4 and @xmath5 unaffected , in such a way that after the successive application of two @xmath1  gates the states of the qubits are interchanged .",
    "each one of these two - qubit gates , together with arbitrary single qubit operations , is universal , i.e. , allows to perform any quantum algorithm . in practice ,",
    "the particular two - qubit gate to be implemented will depend on the physical system under consideration .",
    "with respect to neutral atoms , several different physical mechanisms to perform two - qubit gates have been proposed , ranging from cold controlled collisions @xcite and dipole - dipole interactions @xcite to purely geometric quantum evolution @xcite . in the cold collisional case ,",
    "a two - qubit phase gate was proposed by adiabatically approaching two traps @xcite or by instantaneous state - selective switching of the trapping potentials @xcite . in both cases",
    "the qubit was encoded in some internal degrees of freedom of the atoms , e.g. , spin , zeeman or hyperfine levels . for cold collisions to take place the atoms have to be brought to close distances , such that their quantum statistical nature has to be taken into account .",
    "a detailed study of the role of the bosonic or fermionic character of particles in the context of quantum information in atomic waveguide structures has been done by e.  andersson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "here we address the problem of implementing a quantum gate by adiabatically approaching two bosonic atoms , each stored in a different microtrap .",
    "in contrast to the proposals mentioned above , we assume the qubit to be implemented in the motional states of the atoms , i.e.  an atom in the ground or the first vibrational state of the trap represents @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "note that , as for the ion - trap case , the observation of neutral atoms cooled down to the ground and first vibrational states as well as superposition states in one - dimensional traps has been achieved @xcite . to perform the gate operation ,",
    "we apply the steps outlined in fig .  1 .",
    "initially , the two microtraps are far apart such that the interaction between the two atoms is negligible .",
    "then we adiabatically move both traps close together such that tunneling and cold controlled collisions become important .",
    "the dynamics of this process strongly depend on the particular motional state of the atoms and we can make use of this fact to control the interaction such that , after the eventual separation of the traps , the desired gate operation is realized with each trap again containing only one atom .    to be more specific we consider here laser - cooled rubidium atoms stored in optical microtraps @xcite , assuming that each trap contains initially only one atom .",
    "we will show that the _",
    "@xmath1  gate _ is the most natural quantum gate to be implemented when the qubit is encoded in the motional states of the atoms and interaction takes place through tunneling and cold collisions .",
    "this result applies to both , @xmath8rb and @xmath9rb , although they have negative and positive scattering length , respectively . in particular",
    ", we will demonstrate that a quantum gate of @xmath10 milliseconds duration can be performed in state - of - the - art optical microtraps .",
    "very recently , e.  charron _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed the implementation of a _ phase gate _ in an optical lattice with , as it is done also here , the qubit encoded in the motional states . in this case , a controlled interference set - up was proposed to perform a high - fidelity gate with operation time of @xmath11  ms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the physical model .",
    "section iii is devoted to the implementation of the @xmath1  gate . in section",
    "iv  we discuss some practical considerations . and , finally , section v summarizes the results and presents the conclusions .",
    "in this section we will first write down the hamiltonian for the two atoms stored in the microtraps and discuss the interaction mechanism . we will introduce a time - dependent orthonormal set of single - particle states for each trap that is also orthogonal to the states of the other trap for arbitrary distances between the two traps .",
    "these single - particle states will make it possible to expand the wavefunction in a set of two - particle orthonormal states .",
    "this representation has two important advantages : ( i ) it allows to compute entanglement throughout the whole gate process ; and ( ii ) it strongly reduces the computational time required to simulate a quantum gate operation with respect to a direct numerical integration of the schrdinger equation for the two - particle spatial wavefunction .",
    "finally , we will discuss the physical implementation of the qubits and its implications for the quantum gate operations .",
    "the hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the two atoms in a time - varying particle - independent trapping potential @xmath12 can be written as @xmath13 + u\\left ( \\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2}\\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the mass of the atoms , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the ( three - dimensional ) position and momentum operators for atoms @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 accounts for the interaction between the two atoms .    to simplify the problem , we take the trapping potential shape to be time - independent along @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions : @xmath22 and assume much stronger confinement in @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions than in @xmath23 , such that transverse excitations can be neglected . in fact , we will consider that both atoms are cooled down to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 vibrational ground states and remain there during all the interaction process .",
    "explicitly , we take the following one - dimensional potential to describe the two microtraps separated by a distance @xmath24 : @xmath25   \\label{trapx}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the trapping frequency in the @xmath23 direction , and @xmath27 is the step function",
    ".    the temporary variation of the trap distance is sketched in fig .  1 .",
    "initially the traps are separated by a distance @xmath28 .",
    "the process of slowly approaching them to a minimum separation @xmath29 takes a time @xmath30 and is modeled by the first quarter of a period of a cosine .",
    "then we let the atoms interact for a time @xmath31 and , finally , we slowly separate the traps .     and @xmath31 are the approaching / separating and interaction times , respectively . at @xmath32 atoms located in different traps",
    "do not interact while at @xmath33 tunneling and cold collisions take place . ]",
    "[ time ]    for cold bosonic atoms , the dominant collisional interaction is due to @xmath34-wave scattering @xcite , which can be described by a contact potential of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath34-wave scattering length of the rubidium atoms , e.g. , in the spin triplet @xmath37  @xmath38 for @xmath8rb and @xmath39  @xmath38 for @xmath9rb with @xmath38 being the bohr radius .",
    "as long as both atoms remain in the transverse vibrational ground states , we can integrate out the corresponding degrees of freedom and obtain an effective one - dimensional interaction potential @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the transverse trapping frequency .",
    "( [ trapx ] ) and ( [ scat ] ) allow us to reduce the complexity of the problem to one dimension .",
    "we will implement the qubits into the ground and first excited vibrational states of each trap , i.e. , we will use the motional states of the atoms",
    ". when the two traps are far apart , i.e. , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the position uncertainty of the ground state , these states are the energy eigenstates of two displaced one - dimensional harmonic oscillators :    @xmath44    with @xmath45 and @xmath46 labeling the left and right trap , respectively . as we approach the two traps , these single - particle states overlap and are no longer orthogonal . to numerically integrate the schrdinger equation and to compute entanglement throughout the gate process",
    ", we construct an orthonormal single - particle basis for arbitrary distances of the two traps by applying the gram - schmidt method ( see appendix a ) .",
    "if we denote these new single - particle states by @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 then it holds @xmath50 .",
    "the four states that for large distances correspond to the two lowest states of each trap read    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given in eqs .",
    "( a5 ) . for large separation of the traps ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 for all @xmath56 and thus the @xmath57 become the eigenstates of a single harmonic trap centered at @xmath58 .",
    "notice that the @xmath57 states have the following symmetry under parity transformation : @xmath59 .",
    "the general proof is given in appendix a. this property obviously holds for the @xmath60 , and the @xmath57 are constructed such that this symmetry is maintained .",
    "although above we have written only four states , for all simulations using these orthogonalized states we will include all states up to @xmath61 .",
    "let us motivate the two - particle basis which we will use .",
    "on the one hand , it must satisfy bosonic statistics , i.e.  the basis states have to be symmetric under the permutation of the particles .",
    "on the other hand the hamiltonian of this system is symmetric with respect to parity transformation , i.e.  @xmath62 , and therefore does not couple states of opposite parity .",
    "for this reason we will introduce basis states with well - defined parity . if for this description we limit ourselves again to the four lowest single - particle states , then the bosonic two - particle sector forms a ten - dimensional hilbert space . here",
    ", we use the following notation @xmath63 with 1 and 2 labeling the atoms and @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the bosonic two - particle basis reads :    [ 01s ] @xmath65 @xmath66 ) and ( [ 01as ] ) means the following : superscripts @xmath67 or @xmath68 indicate that the two - particle state has positive or negative parity , respectively , while the tilde accounts for states where , for @xmath69 , both atoms are in the same trap , i.e. , double - occupancy states .",
    "it is easy to check the symmetry of these two - particle states under the exchange of the atoms by making use of the parity property of states @xmath70 discussed after eqs .",
    "in addition it is worth to mention that in our simulations we will consider up to eight single - particle states which gives rise to a bosonic two - particle hilbert space of 36 states ( 20 states having positive parity from which 10 correspond to double occupancy ; and 16 states having negative parity with 10 accounting for double occupancy ) .",
    "finally note that the fact that we are able to expand the wave - function into this finite number of two - particle orthogonal states has also an important advantage with respect to the time needed for the simulation of a gate operation .",
    "we have checked the accuracy of the restriction of the simulation to this subspace by comparing the results of the simulations to a direct numerical integration of the schrdinger equation for the two - particle spatial wavefunction which is about four orders of magnitude slower .",
    "we start from two well separated traps , each containing one atom . in this situation",
    "we can neglect the bosonic nature of the particles and forget about the symmetrization @xcite .",
    "only then it is possible to speak about well - defined qubits and we choose to introduce labels @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the two qubits by labeling the atom found in the left trap by @xmath71 and the atom in the right trap by @xmath72 .    with the two traps far apart , single qubit operations , e.g. , a hadamard gate , can be realized by using two laser pulses in a raman configuration focused solely on one of the traps .",
    "the quantum gate operation between two qubits is much more involved .",
    "as we approach the traps , due to tunneling there will be a non - vanishing probability to find both atoms in the same trap .",
    "thus we can no longer distinguish the atoms such that bosonic statistics become important and the qubits are no longer well defined . if , however , we approach and separate the traps in such a way that finally there is again one atom in each of the well separated traps then we can attribute ( new ) labels @xmath71 and @xmath72 to them in the same way as before .",
    "these considerations suggest the following mapping of the states of the computational basis into the two - particle basis states of eqs .",
    "( [ 01s ] ) and ( [ 01as ] ) :    [ 9 ] @xmath73 ) have a trivial evolution at the trapping frequency ( or multiples of it ) that can be removed by including this phase in the definition of the single particle states .",
    "we will take states ( 10 ) as the starting set for the gate operation and , after setting the initial state , we will adiabatically realize the gate . in this adiabatic regime , if we start in an energy eigenstate the system will follow this time - dependent energy eigenstate during the whole gate process .",
    "the only allowed transitions are those corresponding to states that ( i ) are initially degenerate in energy , and , at short distances , ( ii ) become coupled via tunneling and/or cold collisions . therefore , in order to find the most suitable gate to be implemented in this system , we have to identify these resonant couplings .    for this aim we will first discuss the ideal case for which there is no interaction between the atoms , i.e.  the case where @xmath74 in ( [ scat ] ) .",
    "we then have the following resonant couplings :    [ 10 ] @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , there is a non - negligible probability ( even if we move the two traps adiabatically ) to have both atoms in the same trap after the gate operation .",
    "note that the kinetic and trapping terms of the hamiltonian do not directly couple @xmath78 with @xmath79 since they are single particle hamiltonians and , therefore , they do not allow for the simultaneously change of the motional states of both atoms .",
    "the coupling between @xmath78 and @xmath80 is mediated through the double occupancy states @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "clearly , in the non - interacting case , a quantum gate operation always has to face with double - occuppancy which makes the problem hard to handle .    figures 2(a ) and ( b ) show , for a particular parameter set , the final state of the system after the whole process of approaching and separating the traps as a function of the scattering length . in ( a )",
    "the initial state is @xmath83 and in ( b ) @xmath84 .",
    "although the scattering length has a constant value that depends on the atom under consideration , it is used in this plot as a free parameter to illustrate the double - occupancy problem .",
    "notice that by changing @xmath85 it is possible to tune the strength of the effective interaction potential , cf .",
    "( [ scat ] ) . figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) clearly show that , for @xmath86 , double - occupancy is indeed very important in the final state of the system .     and",
    "( b ) @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the parameter setting is : @xmath88 s@xmath89 , @xmath90 s@xmath89 , @xmath91  nm , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 . , width=332 ]    [ scattering ]    the problem of double - occupancy is naturally suppressed when one takes into account the interaction between the atoms . in this case , double - occupancy states are no longer degenerate with single - occupancy states and we can neglect the probability to find double occupation in the final state by adiabatically moving the traps .",
    "thus , in the presence of interaction , the resonant couplings read    [ 11 ] @xmath96 where @xmath97 @xmath98 notice that now the collisional interaction term ( [ scat ] ) allows for the simultaneous change of the motional states of both atoms .",
    "the role of these couplings is clearly shown in fig .  2 .",
    "2(a ) , where the initial state is @xmath99 , double - occupancy populations in the final state start to decrease and eventually vanish as soon as the scattering length is increased .",
    "when the initial state is @xmath87 , fig .",
    "2(b ) , double - occupancy also vanishes as the scattering length increases , but then the population of state @xmath100 becomes important .",
    "therefore , the coupling given in eq .",
    "( 12a ) suggests the implementation of a @xmath1  gate , as long as we are able to suppress / control coupling ( [ unwanted ] ) .",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath101 and @xmath102 can be broken , for instance , by taking an anharmonic trapping potential such that the vibrational frequencies are no longer equally spaced .",
    "in addition , it is possible to adjust the interaction time in such a way that , at the end of the gate operation , state @xmath102 is not populated . in",
    "what follows , we will focus on this last possibility .",
    "the @xmath1  gate has the following effect on the states of the computational basis :    [ table ] @xmath103    it is straightforward to check that the successive application of two @xmath1  gates exchanges the states of the qubits , i.e. , @xmath104 . as it has been mentioned before , the @xmath1  gate together with single qubit operations",
    "suffices to realize any quantum algorithm @xcite which is not the case for the swap gate itself . a simple way to prove this ,",

    "7 shows that in the limit of large spatial separation of the particles neither the slater rank nor the bosonic von neumann entropy from @xcite coincide with the notion of schmidt rank and von neumann entropy for distinguishable particles .",
    "there are two reasons for this obvious difference : ( i ) slater rank and bosonic von neumann entropy are invariants under arbitrary transformations of the single particle space , while in our case the partition of the full single - particle space into the space spanned by @xmath158 on the one hand and @xmath159 on the other is rather fixed ; ( ii ) they do not take into account that here we want to avoid double - occupation in the final state .    in @xcite p. zanardi follows a different approach to calculate an entropy for indistinguishable particles which consists of mapping the bosonic ( or fermionic ) state to an occupation number basis and calculating the von neumann entropy in this basis .",
    "if this is applied here then the entropy raises from @xmath154 for @xmath99 to @xmath17 for @xmath144 but in between it has a maximum of @xmath162 .",
    "as can be seen from the analysis in @xcite this is due to the presence of spatial entanglement during the operation .",
    "it is however not clear whether this type of entanglement is useful in this context where the two qubits are explicitely implemented in the vibrational states of each trap .",
    "these results thus call for further investigation of the problem of quantum correlations in bosonic states .",
    "scalable systems of optical microtraps based on the dipole force can be realized by focusing a single red - detuned laser beam with a microlens array @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the trap separation as shown in fig .",
    "1 can be realized ( i ) by using two parallel laser beams focused in such a way that the trapping potentials are longitudinally shifted along the common laser beam direction or ( ii ) by illuminating the microlens array with two laser beams under slightly different angles with the possible inclusion of an additional two - dimensional confining potential perpendicular to the direction of the trap displacement @xcite . for the parameters we used in the gate simulations , the minimum distance of @xmath163 corresponds to a separation of the traps of @xmath17  @xmath164 m which is achievable in the present optical microtraps @xcite . with laser powers of @xmath17-@xmath165",
    "@xmath166 per trap , rubidium atoms can be trapped with typical trapping frequencies along the laser beam direction of @xmath167-@xmath168  @xmath169 while the transverse trapping frequencies can be one or two orders of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "additionally , sideband cooling could be applied to cool the atoms to the ground state of each trap in all dimensions .    in the optical microtrap experiments ,",
    "the trapping potential is gaussian - shaped with typical depths of 1 - 10 mk  @xmath170  @xmath171 @xcite . for a single trap",
    "it is thus a good approximation to assume a harmonic potential for the lower lying states . for",
    "two traps being close together the actual potentials will deviate from the form assumed in ( [ trapx ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to generalize the methods applied here to these particular potentials . to allow for single site addressing , typical initial distances between the traps have to be about 5 - 20  @xmath164 m which for rubidium means @xmath172 instead of @xmath173 which we used in our previous calculations . in this case",
    ", it is straightforward to estimate that the process of adiabatically approaching the traps to the interaction distance and eventually separating them again requires another @xmath174 ms .",
    "therefore , the whole gate process could be realized in a few tens of milliseconds which is enough for a proof - of - principle experiment .",
    "in fact , the lifetime of the atoms in the traps is about @xmath175 ms while spontaneous scattering occurs in @xmath176 ms .",
    "however for strongly confining trapping potentials only a small fraction of the occurring spontaneous scattering processes leads to a change in the vibrational state @xcite .    in a recent paper , e.  charron _",

    "@xcite proposed the realization of a phase gate in an optical lattice where the qubits were also implemented in the motional states .",
    "two linear counterpropagating beams from the fundamental and first harmonic of a co@xmath177 laser were used to produce an intensity gradient optical lattice .",
    "the barrier between two neighboring traps could be raised or lowered by changing the intensity ratio between the two beams .",
    "we notice that the realization of a @xmath1  gate as discussed here should also be possible in this setup although the implementation in optical microtraps presents some advantages such as being not sensitive to the phase fluctuations of the lasers .",
    "we have investigated quantum computation in optical microtraps with the qubits implemented in the motional states of neutral atoms , and tunneling and cold controlled collisions accounting for the interaction between two different qubits .",
    "a time - dependent two - particle orthogonal basis has been introduced to simulate the gate operation and to compute entanglement throughout the whole gate process .",
    "the bosonic statistic nature of the particles and its role in entanglement has been discussed in detail .",
    "we have demonstrated the capability of optical microtraps to realize a high - fidelity @xmath1  gate operation in the few tens of milliseconds range . finally , some practical considerations for the physical implementation of this quantum gate have been discussed .",

    "in this appendix we will show how to construct the time - dependent orthonormal single - particle states , denoted by @xmath178 and @xmath179 , from the harmonic oscillator energy eigenstates @xmath180 and @xmath181 for the left and the right trap , respectively .",

    "this set contains states that are neither orthogonal nor normalized . to perform the orthonormalization",
    ", we use the gram - schmidt ( gm ) method starting with the following normalized function : @xmath185 then , we define the first linearly independent function @xmath186 as : @xmath187 where @xmath188 which guaranties @xmath189 .",
    "we repeat this procedure to obtain the rest of the linearly independent functions @xmath190 with positive parity . in an analogous way",
    ", we determine from @xmath191 the set of linearly independent functions @xmath192 . an important feature of the gm method when applied to a set of states with the same parity is that the constructed orthonormal states retain the parity of the original set of states .",
    "thus states from @xmath193 and @xmath193 have positive and negative parity , respectively and , therefore , the whole set @xmath194 is orthonormal .",
    "explicitly , the first four orthonormalized functions read    @xmath195{4\\pi } } e^{-a^{2}\\alpha ^{2}}\\left\\langle x\\right . \\left| 0\\right\\rangle ^{\\mp } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    [ a5 ] @xmath196 for the sake of brevity , we do not explicitly show the analytical expressions for the rest of the @xmath197 .",
    "once we have obtained the orthonormal set @xmath198 , it is straightforward to write down the single - particle basis that we will use :    [ spbasisstates ] @xmath199    these states are orthonormal due to the orthonormality of the @xmath200 and in the limit @xmath42 become the corresponding harmonic oscillator energy eigenstates for each trap .",
    "these new orthonormal states do not have in general a well defined parity with respect to the center of the corresponding trap but it is straightforward to check from eqs .",
    "( [ spbasisstates ] ) that they satisfy the following property under parity transformation with respect to the middle of the traps : @xmath201",
    "our goal here is to write down the sequence of steps required to build the cnot gate , which , in the computational basis @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , reads @xmath206 from the @xmath1  gate @xmath207 the single qubit operations we need are on one hand the hadamard gate @xmath208 and on the other hand the following combination of identity and pauli @xmath209 matrices :      let us call @xmath211 and @xmath107 the corresponding single - qubit operations for qubit a or b. now it is easy to check that the following combination of single - qubit operations and @xmath1  gates yields the phase gate : @xmath212 this sequence is not unique , and more sophisticated sequences involving single - qubit operations on only one of the qubits can be implemented @xcite . finally , to obtain the cnot gate it is enough to apply a hadamard gate on the qubit a at both sides of eq .",
