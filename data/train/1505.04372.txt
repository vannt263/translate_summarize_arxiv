    "quantum entanglement is an intriguing property of composite systems .",
    "the generation of entangled states for two or more particles is not only fundamental for demonstrating quantum nonlocality @xcite , but also useful in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite . for three - qubit entanglement , there are two main kinds of entangled states , the @xmath0 states @xcite and the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite .",
    "these two kinds of entangled states can not be converted to each other by local operations and classical communications . in recent years ,",
    "the @xmath0 states attract more attentions because of its robustness against qubit loss and advantages in quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "so far , lots of theoretical schemes have been proposed to generate @xmath0 states in different systems via different techniques @xcite .",
    "there are two techniques famous for their robustness against decoherence in proper conditions and have been widely used in qip : one is named stimulated raman scattering involving adiabatic passage ( stirap ) including their variants @xcite , and the other one is quantum zeno dynamics ( qzd ) @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the adiabatic passage technique is robust against variations in the experimental parameters and atomic spontaneous emission . to restrain the influence of photon leakage on the fidelity ,",
    "a widely used way is choosing parameters to reduce populations of the intermediate excited states .",
    "however , such operation inevitably increase the operation time . as is known to all , using adiabatic technique ( we name it `` adiabatic scheme '' for short in this paper )",
    "asks for an adiabatic condition that the change of a system s hamiltonian in time is managed to be slow to make sure each of the eigenstates of the system evolves along itself .",
    "using qzd method , by contrast , might be faster than using adiabatic passage .",
    "but that depends , especially in multiparticle systems . usually , in a scheme based on qzd ( we name it `` zeno scheme '' for short in this paper ) , we consider the system s hamiltonian as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the quantum system investigated , @xmath3 is the coupling constant , and @xmath4 is viewed as an additional interaction hamiltonian performing the measurement . when @xmath5 , the system s effective hamiltonian is approximated as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the @xmath8th eigenvalue projection of @xmath4 with eigenvalue @xmath9 .",
    "similar to the adiabatic passage , there is also a limited condition in a zeno scheme that limits the system s speed : the zeno condition @xmath5 .",
    "it has been confirmed by lots of schemes that using qzd for qip is usually robust against photon leakage but sensitive to the atomic spontaneous emission .",
    "therefore , in order to restrain the influence of atomic spontaneous emission , some researchers introduced detunings between the atomic transitions to decrease the population of atomic excited states .",
    "that also inevitably increases the operation time .",
    "in addition , the operation time required in a scheme via qzd always needs to be controlled accurately , which increases the difficulty to realize the scheme in experiment .",
    "as we know , the operation time for a method is the shorter the better , otherwise , the method may be useless because the dissipation caused by decoherence , noise , and losses on the target state increases with the increasing of the interaction time .",
    "many experiments also desire fast and robust theoretical methods because high repetition rates contribute to the achievement of better signal - to - noise ratios and better accuracy .",
    "therefore , fast and noise - resistant generation of entangled states becomes a research hotspot in recent years , especially , after the technique named `` shortcuts to adiabatic passage '' ( stap ) @xcite was proposed .",
    "this technique is related to adiabatic passage but successfully breaks the time limit in an adiabatic process .",
    "it describes a fast adiabatic - like process which is not really adiabatic but leading to the same final populations with adiabatic process .",
    "newly , stap has shown its charm in theory and experiment @xcite . in 2014 , by using transitionless tracking algorithm under large detuning condition , lu _",
    "et al . _ proposed an effective scheme to implement fast populations transfer and fast maximum entanglement preparation between two atoms in a cavity @xcite .",
    "the idea inspires that using some traditional methods to approximate a complicated hamiltonian into an effective and simple one first , then constructing shortcuts for the effective hamiltonian might be a promising method to speed up a system .",
    "soon after that , chen _ et al .",
    "_ first combined invariant - based inverse engineering with zeno subspaces to construct shortcuts to perform fast and noise - resistant populations transfer for multiparticle systems @xcite . in their method , they demonstrated that besides constructing stap , slightly broking down the zeno condition under certain conditions is another simple way to speed up the evolution .",
    "soon after that , similar ideas with slightly breaking the zeno condition down are rapidly used to perform fast and noise - resistant qip @xcite .    motivated by the above analysis , we discuss how to construct stap to rapidly generate @xmath0 states by using the approach of `` transitionless tracking algorithm '' in cavity qed systems .",
    "different from ref .",
    "@xcite which proposed a method through combining lewis - riesenfeld theory and zeno subspaces to generate a @xmath10-atom @xmath0 state by @xmath11 atoms , we do not need to abandon any atoms .",
    "an @xmath10-atom @xmath0 is fast generated directly by @xmath10 atoms in one step . in order to explain the charm by using stap to generate @xmath0 states , we first give a brief description about generation of @xmath0 states via two traditional methods ( stirap and qzd ) .",
    "then , we propose the scheme by using transitionless tracking algorithm in detail .",
    "the comparison among these three schemes demonstrates that the shortcut scheme is not only faster than the adiabatic one , and more robust against operational imperfection than the zeno one .",
    "what is more , this method might be promising when it comes to generation of multi - level and multi - qubit entangled states , i.e. , the singlet states .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section , we give the model of atom - cavity system and introduce two schemes to generate @xmath0 states via traditional adiabatic method and zeno method .",
    "then in section , we use the transitionless - based shortcuts method to propose a fast and noise - resistant scheme to generate @xmath0 states .",
    "the conclusion is derived in section .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that three @xmath12-type atoms ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are trapped in a cavity ( @xmath16 ) as shown in figs .",
    "[ model ] ( a ) and ( b ) , each atom has an excited state @xmath17 and two ground states @xmath18 and @xmath19 . atomic transition @xmath20 is resonantly driven by classical field @xmath21 , and the transition @xmath22 is coupled resonantly to the cavity with coupling @xmath23 . under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , the interaction hamiltonian for this system reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the annihilation operator of the cavity .",
    "we assume the initial state of the system is @xmath26 , the system will evolve within a single - excitation subspace @xmath27 spanned by : @xmath28 in this subspace , the interaction hamiltonian is simplified as ( we set @xmath29 ) @xmath30 for the sake of clearness , we will describe two traditional different methods ( stirap and qzd ) to generate @xmath0 states in brief .      for the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 - 3 ] ) in the single - excitation subspace , we easily find a dark state @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the normalization coefficient .",
    "if we choose @xmath33 at first and make sure that the adiabatic condition @xmath34 is satisfied , where @xmath35 is the @xmath8th eigenstate with nonzero eigenvalue @xmath9 , the initial state @xmath36 will follow @xmath37 closely . then",
    ", we slowly decrease @xmath38 and @xmath39 while increase @xmath40 until @xmath41 at time @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , the dark state becomes @xmath43 which is the @xmath0 state .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ o1o2 ] , to complete this process , we choose the rabi frequencies as ( we set @xmath44 ) @xmath45 , \\cr\\cr     \\omega_{s}&=&\\omega_{0}\\exp[\\frac{-(t+t_{0}-t_{f}/2)^{2}}{t_{c}^{2 } } ]               \\cr\\cr                    & & + \\cos{\\alpha}\\omega_{0}\\exp[\\frac{-(t - t_{0}-t_{f}/2)^{2}}{t_{c}^{2}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the amplitude and @xmath47 are related parameters . to meet the conditions mentioned above , we choose @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "generally speaking , the adiabatic condition is satisfied better with a relatively large @xmath46 because the nonzero eigenvalue @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "[ adicon ] shows the fidelity of the @xmath0 state in adiabatic scheme versus the interaction time @xmath42 and @xmath46 .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ adicon ] , the fidelity is getting higher with both the increases of @xmath46 and @xmath42 .",
    "it seems that when @xmath56 , a high - fidelity @xmath0 state is achievable .",
    "that means when @xmath46 is large enough , we also can create a @xmath0 state in a short interaction time via adiabatic passage . but",
    "further investigation tells us that the system s evolution is far different from adiabatic dark - state evolution with a relatively large @xmath46 and a short interaction time @xmath42 .",
    "[ p1357adi ] ( a ) shows the time - dependent populations for states \\{@xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 } when @xmath61 and @xmath62 , fig .",

    "[ p1357adi ] ( c ) shows time - dependent evolution of the dark state @xmath37 .",
    "the comparison of these three figures draws a result that even with a large @xmath46 , a relatively long interaction time is still necessary to make sure the controlling parameters change slowly enough to allow adiabatic passage from an initial state to a target state .",
    "in addition , because a relatively large @xmath46 might cause that the rwa is no longer effective for the system , and it also means a great population of state @xmath60 including a cavity - excited state that makes the system sensitive to the cavity photon leakage , it is better to choose a relatively small @xmath46 and a long interaction time @xmath42 for an adiabatic process .",
    "before we start using qzd to create a three - atom @xmath0 state , we set @xmath44 and use two orthogonal vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 to rewrite the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 - 3 ] ) as @xmath66 it is obvious that when the initial state is @xmath57 , the terms containing @xmath67 are negligible because they are decoupled to the time evolution of initial state .",
    "then , under the condition @xmath68 ( zeno condition ) , the subspace @xmath27 is split into three zeno subspaces according to the degeneracy of eigenvalues of @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 corresponding eigenvalues @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . under the zeno condition , we obtain the effective hamiltonian governing the evolution @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",

    "the final state becomes @xmath82 .",
    "in general , the interaction time required in a zeno scheme is shorter than that in an adiabatic scheme .",
    "for example , in the present scheme , when we choose relatively large laser pulses , i.e. , @xmath83 , the interaction time in the zeno scheme is only about @xmath84 .",
    "however , it is well known that the interaction time should be controlled accurately in a scheme via qzd .",
    "we plot the fidelity of the @xmath0 state in zeno scheme versus the variation in @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ zenodeltat ] . here",
    "we define @xmath85 as the deviation of any parameter @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the actual value and @xmath86 is the ideal value .",
    "it is clear that a deviation @xmath88 causes a reduction about @xmath89 in the fidelity , which shows the scheme is sensitive to the variation of the interaction time . in experiment , if we choose a related parameter @xmath90ghz , the required interaction time is @xmath91s .",
    "that means , the experimental researchers should accurately control the interaction time to ensure the deviation in @xmath42 is less than @xmath92s .",
    "that is really a challenge in the current experimental technology .",
    "moreover , known from eq .",
    "( [ eq1b-5 ] ) , the intermediate state @xmath93 including atomic - excited states would be greatly populated during the evolution if @xmath40 is too large , and that might make the system sensitive to the spontaneous emission .",
    "different from the two methods ( adiabatic scheme and zeno scheme ) mentioned above , we start from finding a hamiltonian @xmath94 which is related to @xmath95 to fast generate a @xmath0 state via stap .",
    "the key point to construct shortcuts for a system governed by @xmath95 is to find out a hamiltonian @xmath94 which drives the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) of @xmath95 exactly .",
    "known from berry s general transitionless tracking algorithm @xcite , the hamiltonian @xmath94 can be reverse engineered from @xmath95 . and disregarding the effect of phases , the simplest hamiltonian @xmath94 is derived in form of @xmath98 however , it seems impossible to directly design such hamiltonian from @xmath95 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 - 3 ] ) because mathematically solving eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) seems an outstanding challenge .",
    "therefore , in light of qzd , we first simplify the whole system in to an effective subsystem whose hamiltonian is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq1b-4 ] ) . but different from the zeno method , in this section , @xmath40 and @xmath99 are two time - dependent parameters . then the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath100 is @xmath101 corresponding eigenvalues @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , here @xmath104 it is obvious that when @xmath105 , the instantaneous eigenstate @xmath106 is nearly equivalent to @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1a-1 ] ) .",
    "so we can use transitionless tracking algorithm to construct the hamiltonian that exactly drives the eigenstates of @xmath100 , @xmath108 to realize such a hamiltonian , we find out an alternative physically feasible ( apf ) system whose effective hamiltonian is equivalent to @xmath109 .",

    "similar to the transformation from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 - 3 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq1b-1 ] ) , the interaction hamiltonian in the subspace @xmath27 ( the single - excitation subspace for this model is also spanned by eq .",

    "that means , as long as @xmath128 and @xmath129 ; the hamiltonian for speeding up the adiabatic dark - state evolution governed by @xmath130 under condition @xmath131 has been constructed . as we mentioned above , to create a three - atom @xmath0 state by adiabatic dark - state evolution , the riba frequencies @xmath40 and @xmath99 can be chosen in the form in eq .",

    "a brief analysis of @xmath138 tells us that the amplitude of @xmath138 is close to @xmath139 .",
    "that is , the amplitude of @xmath125 is mainly dominated by @xmath140 . according to the limited conditions above",
    ", we have @xmath141 when @xmath23 is a constant value , under the premise that the interaction time @xmath42 is short , to meet the first condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 13 ] ) , it is better to choose a smaller @xmath112 , while to meet the second condition , a larger @xmath112 is required . this",
    "is also demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ deltatf ] which shows the fidelity of the @xmath0 state in the shortcut scheme versus parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "we can find , too small or too large @xmath112 cause a long operation time for the scheme .",
    "then , we choose a set of suitable parameters \\{@xmath144 } for the scheme . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ft ] ( a ) , with these parameters , we can achieve a perfect populations transfer after very slightly correcting a related parameter ( @xmath145 ) by numerical simulation .",
    "the parameter should be slightly corrected because speeding up the evolution needs to slightly broke the zeno condition , and that cause a slight failure of the approximation .",
    "we plot the time evolution of the populations in intermediate states @xmath60 and @xmath93 in fig .",
    "[ ft ] ( b ) to prove this operation is necessary . in the figure , the state @xmath60 should have been neglected is slightly populated ( the zeno condition is slightly broken ) while the state @xmath93 is negligible ( the second condition in eq . ( [ eq2 - 13 ] ) is fulfilled ) .",
    "we give a comparison of the fidelities via these three different methods in fig .",
    "[ ft ] ( c ) . contrasting with the zeno method ,",
    "the advantage of the present shortcut method is obvious : the shortcut scheme is more robust against operational imperfection than the zeno one , especially , it is not necessary to control the interaction time accurately . as demonstrated in fig . [ deltatz ] , the fidelity almost keeps unchanging with the variation @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the total operation time chosen to complete the scheme , and a deviation @xmath148 which means the variation in the amplitude of @xmath125 only causes a reduction about 1% in the fidelity .",
    "now , we will check the robustness of the shortcut scheme against possible mechanisms of decoherence .",
    "the evolution of the system can be modeled by a master equation in lindblad form when the decoherence is considered , @xmath149+\\sum_{k}[l_{k}\\rho l_{k}^{\\dag}-\\frac{1}{2}(l_{k}^{\\dag}l_{k}\\rho+\\rho l_{k}^{\\dag}l_{k})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the density operator for the whole system and @xmath150 are the lindblad operators . for the shortcut scheme , there are seven lindblad operators governing the dissipation : @xmath151 where @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) are the atomic spontaneous emissions and @xmath154 is the cavity decay .",
    "we set @xmath155 for simplicity . then by numerically solving the master equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 15 ] ) , we plot the fidelity of the @xmath0 state in the shortcut scheme versus @xmath156 and @xmath157 in fig .",
    "[ fkr ] ( a ) .",
    "we can find that the shortcut scheme is more sensitive to the cavity decay than atomic spontaneous emissions with parameters \\{@xmath158}. the reason has been mentioned above that with this set of parameters , the zeno condition is not satisfied faultlessly .",
    "so the states @xmath159 and @xmath160 containing cavity - excited state @xmath60 are populated in a certain extent during the evolution .",
    "furthermore , the parameters can be selected properly to restrain the cavity decay in the experiment according to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 13 ] ) .",
    "for example , when we choose \\{@xmath161 , @xmath162 } , the zeno condition can be satisfied well .",

    "however , it is without doubt that the scheme is robust because the fidelity decreases slowly and even when @xmath163 , we still can create a @xmath0 state with a high fidelity @xmath164 .",
    "this scheme can be easily generalized to generate @xmath10-atom @xmath0 states .",

    "<S> we propose a scheme to generate @xmath0 states based on transitionless - based shortcuts technique in cavity quantum electronic dynamics ( qed ) system . in light of quantum zeno dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> we first effectively design a system whose effective hamiltonian is equivalent to the counter - diabatic driving hamiltonian constructed by transitionless quantum driving , then , realize the @xmath0 states generation within this framework . for the sake of clearness , </S>",
    "<S> we describe two stale schemes for @xmath0 states generation via traditional methods : the adiabatic dark - state evolution and the quantum zeno dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison among these three schemes shows the shortcut scheme is closely related to the other two but better than them . </S>",
    "<S> that is , numerical investigation demonstrates that the shortcut scheme is faster than the adiabatic one , and more robust against operational imperfection than the zeno one . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , the present scheme is also robust against decoherence caused by spontaneous emission and photon loss . </S>"
