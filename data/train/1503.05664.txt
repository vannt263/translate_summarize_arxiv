    "we have verified this claim in another shunted wl device , with same @xmath18 value and smaller @xmath1 , showing a @xmath56 below 4.2 k. in any case , the shunt - resistor has to be kept close enough to the wl , so as to avoid relaxation oscillations , but not too close to cause heat or electron sharing between wl and the shunt , which can affect the wl superconductivity .",
