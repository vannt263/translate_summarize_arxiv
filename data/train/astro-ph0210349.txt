    "the biggest challenge facing studies of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) is that their distances and masses are almost completely unknown .",
    "we attack this problem by using the upgraded arecibo telescope to completely map a large area ( @xmath5 ) around the local group dwarf galaxy lgs  3 and a newly identified hvc .",
    "if the hvc and the dwarf galaxy are interacting , as we will argue , then this system presents a unique opportunity to constrain the distance and mass of an hvc .",
    "the  cloud next to lgs  3 appears to have been first detected by hulsbosch in 1982 using the dwingeloo 25  m telescope @xcite .",
    "@xcite listed the cloud in three entries in their hvc survey , at @xmath6 ) = ( 127\\degr,-41\\degr,-331)$ ] , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , all of which they consider to be part of lgs  3 , which is located at @xmath6 ) = ( 126\\fdg75,-40\\fdg89,-287)$ ] .",
    "the original  observations of lgs  3 by @xcite , made using arecibo , did not detect the cloud because they were directed at the optical position of the galaxy rather than 30  away .",
    "@xcite noted the clear velocity gradient across the cloud , but they were unable to draw any conclusions about the nature of the cloud from the 36-resolution observations .",
    "the cloud was also seen in the leiden / dwingeloo survey ( lds ) of galactic neutral hydrogen @xcite and was found by @xcite to be substantially larger in both area and  mass ( if at the same distance as the galaxy ) than lgs  3 itself .",
    "@xcite further noticed that the velocity of the cloud was different from that of the dwarf galaxy by @xmath9 and postulated that the cloud could have been removed from lgs  3 by ram - pressure stripping .",
    "however , they also argued that the hvc should have a less negative velocity than the dwarf galaxy in the case of ram - pressure stripping , making this interpretation doubtful .    in  [ sec :",
    "obs ] , we describe our observations and discuss the data reduction .",
    "our analysis of the data is presented along with our map of the hvc and its rotation curve in ",
    "[ sec : results ] . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results and evidence for a possible interaction between the hvc and lgs  3 .",
    "the observations were conducted over five nights in 2000 november using the upgraded arecibo telescope .",
    "we employed the l - band narrow receiver and the 9-level , dual - polarization correlator configuration to yield spectra with a velocity resolution of 0.644 . at the frequency of  observations , the telescope has a half - power beam width of 34 , a main beam efficiency of 0.48 , and a gain of 7.2  k / jy @xcite .",
    "the data we present in this paper include 3 nights of on - the - fly ( otf ) maps , nyquist sampled in right ascension and declination , and 2 nights of drift scans .",
    "the otf maps cover a 93  @xmath10 93region and the drift scans add sensitivity in a 40  @xmath10 40  area between and including the hvc and lgs  3 .",
    "the integration time was @xmath1122 s beam@xmath12 for most of the map and @xmath1192 s beam@xmath12 in the area covered by the drift scans .",
    "we reached rms sensitivity levels at the full velocity resolution of 75 mk beam@xmath12 and 34 mk beam@xmath12 in those regions , respectively .",
    "each night we observed a single off - source position , which we used to remove the bandpass shape for all of the spectra from that night .",
    "gain calibration was provided by the injection of a known signal into the correlator once per strip .",
    "we fitted and removed a linear baseline from each spectrum .",
    "we developed a new algorithm to remove spectral standing waves that were present in the data .",
    "the drift scans were resampled to match the sampling of the otf maps , and we then coadded each night s observations to form a single data cube .",
    "the reduction will be described in more detail in a future paper presenting the results of our survey of 27 hvcs and local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "our map ( figure [ fig : map ] ) reveals considerable detail that was not apparent in previous observations . the  associated with lgs  3 is visible in the upper right ( northwest ) as the small red blob at @xmath13 .",
    "the emission is marginally resolved spatially and has an intensity - weighted mean lsr velocity of @xmath14 .",
    "we measure an integrated  flux of @xmath15  jy , in agreement with the value of @xmath16  jymeasured by @xcite . for a distance of 700  kpc ,  kpc . we adopt an intermediate distance of 700  kpc for all calculations . ]",
    "the  mass of lgs  3 is @xmath17 .",
    "the extended emission seen previously @xcite now appears as a large , double - lobed  cloud in the center of the map with a systemic velocity of @xmath18 , an integrated flux of @xmath19  jy , and a mean linewidth of 24 .",
    "this cloud is completely separate from lgs  3 , located 30  away with a velocity difference of @xmath20 .",
    "if the cloud is at the distance of lgs  3 , it contains 10 times as much , making it unlikely that it originated in lgs  3 .",
    "therefore , this cloud qualifies as an hvc .",
    "although lgs  3 and the hvc may not share a common origin , their apparent proximity demands that we investigate the possibility of an interaction betweeen them . to the east of the hvc , at @xmath21 ,",
    "a faint vertical strip of  extends for @xmath1120  along the edge of the map .",
    "a similar feature is also visible running horizontally in the southwest at @xmath22 .",
    "the symmetrical placement of this gas relative to the line connecting lgs  3 and the hvc is suggestive of a tidal interaction , with the two faint clouds representing leading and trailing tidal arms .",
    "we consider this idea further in  4 .",
    "the most striking feature of the hvc is the velocity gradient across it .",
    "we examined the gradient by averaging spectra perpendicular to the major axis .",
    "we fitted a gaussian profile to the averaged spectrum at each point along the major axis to create a rotation curve , which is displayed in figure [ fig : rc]_a_. the rotation curve contains a roughly linear gradient over its central 20  and then turns over .",
    "the turnover and the overall symmetry of the rotation curve suggest that the hvc is a single , rotating , gravitationally - bound object , and is not composed of two physically distinct clouds that happen to coincide along the line of sight . in order to measure a symmetric rotation curve from two separate clouds",
    ", they would have to : have the same extent ; have the same large aspect ratio ; be aligned along their major axes ; have their velocity fields vary with radius in just such a way as to mimic the appearance of a single rotating cloud .",
    "we consider this , although not impossible , very unlikely .",
    "we further point out that if the hvc were composed of two overlapping clouds then the linewidths would be largest at the center of the hvc .",
    "since we observe exactly the opposite , we conclude that the hvc must be a single cloud .",
    "we can therefore use the rotation curve to compare the dynamical mass of the hvc to its luminous mass , which we assume consists only of and a cosmic abundance of he , such that @xmath23 .",
    "the dynamical mass ( ) is the mass required to account for the rotational velocity of the hvc at the last measured point ( see figure [ fig : rc]_b _ ) .",
    "the  mass scales as the square of the distance to the hvc , @xmath24 , which is @xmath25 for a distance of 700  kpc .",
    "the dynamical mass , however , scales linearly with distance , @xmath26 , yielding @xmath27 at 700 kpc .",
    "( note that we assume that the rotation is seen edge - on ; if this is not the case , then the actual dynamical mass will be larger by a factor of @xmath28 . )",
    "therefore , if the hvc is indeed self - gravitating , as is suggested by its rotation curve , and it is located at the distance of lgs  3 , _ it must be composed mostly of dark matter _ ( 82% ) .",
    "furthermore , if the cloud is assumed to be any closer than lgs  3 ( and is self - gravitating ) , its dynamical - mass - to - luminous - mass ratio ( @xmath29 ) must be even larger ; if the cloud is further than lgs  3 , it remains dark - matter dominated out to a distance of 1.9  mpc . since the darkest known galaxy - sized objects have @xmath30 ( see *",
    "* and references therein ) , we can place a firm lower limit on the distance to the hvc of 39  kpc .",
    "is the hvc indeed interacting with lgs  3 ? we can approach this question by considering the likelihood that these two objects are completely unrelated .",
    "@xcite find that compact hvcs cover @xmath311% of the southern sky .",
    "@xcite use an automated analysis of the lds to measure a similar covering fraction for @xmath32 .",
    "there are indications in the @xcite catalog of a factor of @xmath112 overdensity of compact hvcs within 20  of lgs  3 , which is not surprising because m31 and the local group barycenter are located in the same direction as lgs  3 .",
    "we estimate the probability of a spatial coincidence between a dwarf galaxy and a compact hvc by considering the number of compact hvcs and dwarf galaxies near lgs  3 .",
    "for example , within 20  of lgs  3 there are 5 dwarf spheroidal galaxies and 14 compact hvcs from the @xcite catalog .",
    "the hvc discussed in this paper is located @xmath1130  away from lgs  3 , so we take a circle of radius 30  around each of the nearby dwarfs .",
    "now , the probability that at least one of the compact hvcs lies within one of these circles is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of compact hvcs contained in the region , @xmath35 is the solid angle subtended by the circles around the five dwarf galaxies , and @xmath36 is the solid angle subtended by the region within 20  of lgs  3 .",
    "this probability is 4.4% .",
    "if we increase the region under consideration to within 60  of lgs  3 , there are 10 dwarf spheroidals ( including the small dwarf irregulars wlm and pegasus ) and 46 compact hvcs , and the probability of a chance coincidence is 3.5% . including the probability of the velocities coinciding within 50  will make the overall probability of such a configuration even lower .",
    "however , since these values are not negligibly small , we can not dismiss the possibility of a chance superposition entirely .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude the hvc is probably at the same distance as lgs  3 .",
    "another piece of evidence that the hvc is not associated with the milky way is its extremely large velocity with respect to the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) of @xmath37 .",
    "an object originally associated with the galaxy ( e.g. , in a galactic fountain ) would have difficulty acquiring such a high velocity .",
    "this velocity also renders a distance beyond the local group implausible .",
    "could this object be another dwarf galaxy interacting with lgs  3 , rather than an hvc ?",
    "@xcite searched most of the compact hvcs in the northern hemisphere and concluded that they do not contain stellar counterparts similar to the known local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "there is no obvious counterpart to this hvc on the second palomar observatory sky survey plates .",
    "we used the techniques of @xcite to search more carefully and found a very faint low - surface brightness feature nearby .",
    "however , follow - up imaging with the lick 3  m telescope revealed that there is no distant stellar population here . therefore this cloud , like all other compact hvcs , appears to be a pure gas cloud .",
    "based on our data , we suggest that the faint features to the east and south of the hvc are remnants of a tidal interaction between the hvc and lgs  3 .",
    "we now consider the consequences of such a situation .",
    "the total mass of lgs  3 ( derived from its central velocity dispersion ) is @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "hence , its tidal field becomes comparable to the surface gravity of the hvc if the hvc orbit has a minimum approach of @xmath114  kpc .",
    "if the faint features are tidal in origin , the orbit of the hvc is strongly constrained . since the gravity of lgs  3 is not enough to bind the system  the escape velocity of lgs  3 is @xmath1119 , while the relative velocity between lgs  3 and the hvc is @xmath3950the encounter between them must be a one - time event .",
    "the existence of the tidal tails implies that they have already made their closest approach .",
    "given their relative velocity and their projected separation of 5.8  kpc , such an approach would have taken place @xmath40 years ago .",
    "we have presented high - resolution  observations of a 2.4 deg@xmath41 area including the local group dwarf galaxy lgs  3 and a previously unresolved cloud of gas adjacent to the galaxy .",
    "our data show that the  cloud is 30  away from the galaxy , with a velocity difference of @xmath20 , and that they do not appear to be connected .",
    "if they are at the same distance , the cloud contains 10 times as much  and twice as much total mass as lgs  3 .",
    "optical imaging of the cloud revealed no stellar counterparts .",
    "we therefore argue that the cloud is an hvc , and should not be considered part of the component of lgs  3 .",
    "however , the  morphology does suggest that an interaction is occurring .",
    "we propose that the faint thin strips of gas on either side of the hvc are tidal arms produced by a close encounter with lgs  3 .",
    "we note that the probability of a line - of - sight coincidence between the two objects , if they are at different distances , is @xmath114% .",
    "we therefore suggest that the most likely interpretation of this system is that lgs  3 and the hvc are at the same distance and have recently undergone a tidal interaction .",
    "we also examine the rotation curve of the hvc , which exhibits a linear increase with radius out to 10  and then begins to decrease . under the assumption that the hvc is self - gravitating , which is supported by the rotation curve s symmetry and turnover at large radii",
    ", we use the dynamical mass and the  mass to derive a lower distance limit for the hvc . for @xmath29 to be @xmath42 , the hvc must be at least 39  kpc away if it is self - gravitating .",
    "the extremely negative  of the hvc constrains it to be within the local group .",
    "this hvc is thus unique in that there is evidence that it is both dark - matter dominated and physically associated with an object at a known distance .",
    "we thank phil perillat , karen oneil , mike nolan , & arun venkataraman for their support during our observations and carl heiles for his indispensable guidance .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grant ast 99 - 81308 ."
