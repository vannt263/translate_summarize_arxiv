    "oil supply and increasing environmental concerns strongly motivate research efforts toward the electrification of transportation , and technological advances have fostered a rapid arrival of electric vehicles ( evs ) in the market . however , the charging of evs has a tremendous impact on the stakeholders in both the electricity and transportation domains , such as electricity producers , power grid operators , policy makers , retailers , and customers  @xcite .",
    "the ev load can drive electricity prices up  @xcite , and alter the producers generation portfolios , resulting in an increase of co@xmath0 emission  @xcite .",
    "additionally , high penetration with uncontrolled charging threatens the sustainability of distribution networks  @xcite .",
    "for example , for an ev penetration of 25% , almost 30% of network facilities would need to be upgraded , while this ratio drops to 5% if the charging load can be shifted to less crowded time periods  @xcite .",
    "these research works reach a consensus that ev charging should be controlled to avoid distribution congestion and higher peak - to - average ratios ( i.e. , demand sporadicity ) .    at the same time",
    ", the power grid is witnessing one of its major evolutions since its conception at the beginning of the past century .",
    "the classical structure of electricity being produced in a small number of big , centralized , power plants , and flowing through the transmission and distribution networks to be consumed by end users is being challenged by the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources . the possibility to communicate bidirectionally with all elements of the grid  and as a consequence to achieve unprecedented levels of monitoring and control  serves as a major technological enabler of the new smart grid , allowing to accommodate new types of demand and production sources as illustrated in figure  [ fig : smartgrid ] .        in this context ,",
    "evs impose new burdens due to the extra demands they constitute , but also open opportunities thanks to the fact that their demands are relatively flexible , and that their batteries can be temporarily used to support the power grid : evs can be active contributors in the smart grid instead of passive consumers .",
    "the important aspect stressed in this paper is that evs can not be assumed to be directly coordinated by a central entity controlling all charging processes . indeed , evs belong to individuals with specific preferences and constraints , who would not relinquish control of the charging process without being properly compensated .",
    "instead , it is reasonable to assume that they react selfishly to management schemes : only when sufficient incentives are offered may ev owners coordinate their charging time and power , i.e. , reschedule ( directly or by giving some control to an external entity ) the charging process rather than recharging their batteries within the shortest delay , which is convenient for them but problematic in the grid operator perspective .",
    "those incentives can take several forms , from fixed rewards for letting the grid control the charging , to auctions for energy , or through time - varying prices set by grid operators .",
    "therefore , we think ev charging must be managed using market mechanisms , where participants are assumed to have different objectives .",
    "hence an appropriate framework to study the ev management schemes is that of economy , and more precisely game theory  @xcite which provides specific tools to model and analyze the interactions among self - interested actors .",
    "this paper reviews the economy - driven schemes for ev charging management proposed in the literature . while the research on that topic is quite flourishing in the last years , there is to our knowledge no work presenting a comprehensive overview of the different approaches considered .",
    "this paper classifies the existing models , highlights their main assumptions and results , in order to compare them and identify the most promising types of mechanisms together with the directions that deserve further research .",
    "ev charging management requires the support of a corresponding communication structure . in some algorithms",
    ", information is broadcasted from grid operators to evs ; bidirectional unicast is sometimes needed to coordinate the charging behaviors of specific evs ; finally evs multicasting to charging stations ( with or without station relaying ) and stations responding ( by unicast , multicast or broadcast ) are necessary in reservation - based systems .",
    "the importance of information and communication technologies on the implementation of a so - called smart grid can never be overemphasized  @xcite , and specially designed communication systems for vehicles  @xcite are also relevant for better scheduling the charging of evs . hence charging algorithms and the corresponding communication systems should be considered simultaneously to make the best of their economical and environmental potentials .",
    "existing works in the literature provide general overviews of the requirements and challenges ; here we further investigate the economic properties of the charging algorithms , but keep track of their prerequisites on communication systems in terms of the volume and the frequency of information exchanges .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : evssystems ] briefly discusses the technical environment of the charging problem , introduces the economic vocabulary and the desirable properties of an ev management scheme .",
    "the next two sections present and classify the charging schemes proposed in the literature to exploit the benefits and avoid undesirable outcomes from evs entering the grid ecosystem : section  [ sec : unidirectional charging ] focuses on _ unidirectional charging _",
    "( energy only goes from the grid to the ev batteries ) while section  [ sec : bidirectional energy trading ] allows _ bidirectional energy trading _ ( the grid can also take energy from the on - board ev batteries ) .",
    "section  [ sec : communication ] summarizes the communication aspects of the schemes ( type of exchanges , volume and frequency ) , while section  [ sec : mechanism ] provides a general classification of all models and approaches , stressing their limitations to highlight the need for further research in specific directions .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the term  electric vehicle \" can refer to a broad range of technologies . generally speaking",
    ", the extension of this concept covers all vehicles using electric motor(s ) for propulsion , including road and rail vehicles , surface and underwater vessels , even electric aircrafts . since our paper concerns the charging management schemes and their impacts on the grid as well as on their owners from an economic perspective ,",
    "we narrow the use of  electric vehicle \" to mention a passenger car with a battery that needs refills of electricity from external sources . battery electric vehicles ( bev ) and plug - in hybrid electric vehicles ( phev ) are two types of plug - in electric vehicles ( pev ) ; phevs differ from bevs in that the former have a gasoline or diesel engine coexisting with an electric motor",
    ".    the economic mechanisms evoked in this paper mainly differ in the way prices are defined , in the mobility models ( if any ) of evs , in the time scale considered , and in the directions for power flows ( from the grid to evs , or both ways ) .",
    "the specificities of evs  being bevs or phevs  do not play a major role with regard to the economic aspects , and often schemes are proposed that can be indifferently applicable to each type of ev . hence in this survey we present mechanisms without always specifying the ev type ; we do it when it has an influence on the performance or applicability of the scheme .",
    "note that charging can be performed in diverse ways : evs can use an on - board or off - board charger  @xcite , or use inductive charging while parked , thanks to inductive power transmission ( ipt ) technology  @xcite . the ultimate experience of ipt is charging while in motion , of which a prototype named on - line electric vehicle ( _ olev _ ) has been designed in the korea advanced institute of science & technology  @xcite . those cases being rare",
    ", we can consider in this paper that the charging is done via a physical connection with an on - board plug . to insure safe electricity delivery to an ev from the source , some particular ev supply equipment ( evse )",
    "is needed , which puts tight constraints on how evs can be recharged ( or discharged if possible ) . the charging rate limit , battery capacity and ac / dc conversion efficiency vary among the different charging facilities and patterns .",
    "two levels for ac charging and three levels for dc charging are approved by the sae j1772 standard , as shown in table  [ fig : sae_j1772 ] , giving the estimated time @xmath1 needed to fully recharge a battery with @xmath2kwh usable pack size , starting from an initial state of charge ( soc ) of @xmath3 .",
    "c|c|c| & level 1&level 2 +  ac & @xmath4kw & @xmath5kw + & @xmath6h&@xmath7h +     +    c|p.17|c|c| & level 1&level 2&level 3 +  dc&@xmath8kw & @xmath9kw & @xmath10kw + & @xmath11h&@xmath12min&@xmath13min +    there are other charging standard proposals , which roughly correspond to the categories in table  [ fig : sae_j1772 ] . for example",
    "chademo falls into dc level 2 , and tesla supercharger overlaps with dc level 3 .    at the other end of the wire stretching out from an ev socket is a charging station . figure  [ fig : charging_facilities ] summarizes the main categories in which we can divide the charging stations .        _ individual stations _ capable of charging a single ev refer to those located in individual homes . _",
    "parking lots _ for evs are yet to be developed to their full potential : they contain many individual evses in physical proximity , belonging to the same entity .",
    "public ev parkings are open to any ev , while private ev parkings provide access only to a specific fleet of evs , e.g. , owned by a single company . _ on - road stations _ are relays for evs on long journeys , they can generally charge evs at the highest possible rate to minimize the delay",
    ".    _ roadbed infrastructures _ for evs are based on ipt technology  @xcite .",
    "we already witness roadbed infrastructures that charge evs at traffic intersections  @xcite or even without stopping  @xcite . as some evs",
    "can use other types of energy sources , they can be replenished in _ refueling station _",
    ", e.g. classical petrol stations , compressed air stations , or _ battery - swapping stations_. those charging solutions are out of the scope of this paper due to the fact that they are either to some extent overlapping with refueling problems for conventional cars , or still in experimental stage .",
    "the smart grid is an evolution of the power grid which is expected to lead to a more efficient use of the grid resources , for example with a reduced peak - to - average power consumption ratio , faster repairs , self - healing and self - optimizing possibilities , and full integration of renewable energy sources .",
    "demand response ( dr ) is the possibility for the power grid to alter the consumption patterns of end users ; it can be implemented through various mechanisms .",
    "dr was initially used primarily toward large electricity consumers , but the transition to the smart grid provides a paradigm shift , where every load , no matter how small , can participate in a dr program .",
    "energy storage is a key technology for the integration of renewable energy sources to the grid .",
    "pumped - storage hydroelectricity ( psh ) accounts for 99% of the world bulk storage capacity , but there are physical limitations to the quantity of energy that these types of storage can hold .",
    "electric vehicles can both participate in dr and serve as energy storage facilities .",
    "they can respond to dr signals , such as price variations or direct control messages by modulating their power consumption , thus providing necessary flexibility to the grid operator . in some cases",
    ", evs can also inject electricity back to the grid , thus serving as distributed energy sources .",
    "these can be leveraged by the network operators to improve renewable energy integration , to help self - healing or to provide ancillary services , so as to reduce the dependency on specialized equipments like diesel generators .",
    "figure  [ fig : evactors ] shows the major entities related to ev charging .",
    "a transmission system operator  @xcite ( tso , in europe)or in some contexts ( in north america ) an independent system operator  @xcite ( iso)is responsible for operating , ensuring the maintenance of and , if necessary , developing the transmission system in a given area .",
    "consumers equipped with energy sources that can deliver electricity to the distribution network are called prosumers .    in a classical electricity market ,",
    "end - users have contracts with an electricity _ retailer _ , who buys the electricity produced by _ generators_.",
    "the transaction can be brokered via a bilateral agreement or on a wholesale market . as the aggregated energy consumption of a big region",
    "can be known with satisfactory precision well in advance , contracts for buying the bulk of the necessary electricity can be done a year or a month ahead on the _ futures market_. however , electricity consumption is heavily dependent on the weather , thus requires a significant amount of energy to be traded @xmath14 hours in advance on the _ day - ahead market_. finally , fine adjustments can be made up to an hour ahead , which are traded on the _ intra - day market_. to match supply and demand for electricity instantaneously , iso / tsos operate ancillary services markets ( generally using auctions ) where they purchase ancillary services from generators and/or consumers who have the ability to vary their generation or consumption powers .",
    "iso / tsos also keep a close watch on the efficiency and effectiveness of those markets .      as elaborated before , ev charging involves many smart grid actors , whose objectives are not necessarily aligned : ev owners want to store enough energy as quickly as possible , and at the lowest cost , whatever the impact on other evs or on generation costs ; electricity producers and retailers are mainly driven by net benefits ; while isos generally aim to ensure the most efficient use of resources and to maintain the supply - demand balance .",
    "therefore , when designing mechanisms to decide allocations and prices paid , one has to anticipate that the actors may try to play the system at their advantage .",
    "for example , if decisions are made based on signals from users such as their willingness - to - pay , the rules should ensure that reporting untruthful values does not bring any gain to the corresponding actors : such a property is called _ incentive compatibility_.    more generally , an appropriate framework to study the interactions among several decision - makers is that of game theory  @xcite .",
    "a key notion is the nash equilibrium , that is an outcome ( a decision made by each actor ) such that no actor can improve his individual payoff ( utility ) through an unilateral move . as stable situations ,",
    "nash equilibria are often considered to be the expected outcomes from interactions .",
    "hence many of the mechanisms described in this paper rely on that notion .",
    "nash equilibria can be attained when all actors have perfect knowledge of their opponents , their decision sets , and their preferences .",
    "but those strong ( and often unrealistic ) conditions are not necessary : in several cases the nash equilibria can be reached or approached via some limited information exchanges among actors , or even without such exchanges but just by trying out decisions and _ learning _ the best ones  @xcite .    to summarize the ev charging problem setting , we recall the relevant actors and set up the vocabulary as below :    * ev : a physical electric vehicle or its owner who will generally be assumed to have a _ utility function _ ( or benefit ) , that represents his preferences .",
    "we will mostly use the classical _ quasi - linear utility _",
    "model  @xcite : for a given price and energy allocation , the ev owner utility will be the difference between the owner s _ willingness - to - pay _ ( or _ valuation _ , i.e. , the value of energy for him , expressed in monetary units ) and the price actually paid . *",
    "aggregator : an entity acting as an intermediary between the demand ( retailers / users ) and supply ( generators , iso / tso or charging stations in some scenarios ) sides of the electricity market @xcite . when an aggregator is designed to be a representative of a group of ev owners",
    ", its utility will be the aggregated user utility .",
    "otherwise , when it acts in its own interest as an intermediate energy supplier , the measure of utility will similarly be the difference between _ revenues _ ( the monetary gains from their clients ) and _ costs_. that difference is often called _ benefit_. * ev charging station : the owner and/or operator of one or several evses in physical proximity , who allows ev recharging and/or discharging with the aim of maximizing revenue , but always under some physical constraints such as local transformer capacity and standard recharging power level . * iso ( or tso ) : an entity in charge of operating and maintaining the transmission system in a given area .",
    "it sets a constraint for the aggregated ev load according to the transformer capacity , and purchases ancillary services when necessary , in order to maintain the supply - demand balance .",
    "the aggregated utility of all users ( here , evs ) is called _ user welfare _ , and",
    "the aggregated utility of all suppliers ( ev charging stations or aggregator ) is the _ supplier welfare_. _ social welfare _ ( = user welfare+supplier welfare ) quantifies the global value of the system for the society , and is computed as the sum of all users valuations minus all costs ( production , transportation , if any ) .",
    "note that money exchanges do not appear in that measure , since they stay within the society .    to provide a guideline for future proposals , we list in table  [ tab : criteria ] the main questions raised by ev charging , and summarize from our point of view , the criteria that make a good charging management scheme .",
    "also , we indicate in which sections of this paper those points are addressed .",
    "[ tab : criteria ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     &  @xcite(a plan for a whole day is made on priori knowledge of price or consumption ) ; +",
    "we summarize in table  [ tab : aggregator ] the economic approaches described in section  [ sec : unidirectional charging ] and section  [ sec : bidirectional energy trading ] .",
    "firstly the models are classified into two categories , namely _",
    "static _ and _ dynamic _ ones , defined in subsection  [ subsubsec : sharingfuture ] .",
    "static models deal with an isolated time interval in which the performance is determined by actions taken during this time , and optimal actions can be found based on current state information .",
    "contrarily , in a dynamic model where system information varies over time , actions should be updated based on state perturbations caused by such sequential revelations , leading to dynamic optimization methods  @xcite as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mdp ] . as such",
    ", the static setting could be seen as a special case where the state is constant ( but still depends on the action taken ) .",

    "ideally , such a central controller has access to all the information needed , thus the management problem reduces to a classical optimization problem : the room for research is therefore    * for static models , in improving the optimization methods in terms of computational efficiency and/or approximation of the optimum ; * for dynamic models , in increasing the prediction accuracy and designing algorithms that are robust to unpredictable residuals .",
    "in contrast , _ game - theoretic approaches _ refer to the cases where interactions among several rational actors are considered : even if resources are still dispatched by a central controller , the allocations are affected by other actors selfish behaviors ( e.g. , bids sent by evs ) . here",
    ", static problems already lead to complex models , and even for those approaches , analytical proofs of incentive - compatibility are only valid for some very specific utility functions .",
    "while the need seems to be for incentive compatible mechanisms in dynamic settings , designing such schemes is still an open research question in many cases .",
    "the difficulty often lies in the evolution of knowledge and beliefs ( and thus actions ) of actors over time , since the actions taken partly reveal one s private information ; analyzing the equilibria of such games is extremely complex .",
    "the last main criterion is related to the implementation type of the schemes : _ revelation schemes _ imply that actors have to exchange information ( such as the willingness - to - pay ) , and can choose strategically what to reveal , hence the importance of properties such as incentive compatibility . on the opposite ,",
    "_ ttonnement schemes _ involve a convergence of allocations ( and often prices ) through iterative methods .",
    "a key aspect in several ttonnement - based mechanisms is the convergence of the method : here the limits we found are in the convergence speed ( especially in dynamic settings : do prices and allocations have time to converge before the setting changes , say , before another ev arrives ? ) .",
    "this is barely addressed in the literature , where in addition convergence is only established for some specific types of utility functions , which need validation .",
    "the classification highlights the need for game - theoretic models in dynamic settings .",
    "while it is extremely difficult to design incentive - compatible schemes in dynamic settings , it seems capital to us to develop game - theoretic approaches , even if based on ttonnement schemes .",

    "electric vehicles , in addition to the prospect of being wholly driven by renewable energy , are not only energy - efficient but also cost - efficient  @xcite , and emit less greenhouse gas than fossil - fuel based transportation .",
    "the main risk they incur comes from the negative impacts they may have on the grid , mostly caused by uncontrolled recharging superimposing on other loads , which exacerbates the grid aging . coordinating recharging and/or discharging not only alleviates those negative effects , but can also help improve the grid by participating to services such as frequency regulation and energy storage for ( intermittent ) renewable energy generation .",
    "these opportunities can be realized in the smart grid realm , so evs and smart grid are mutually reinforcing . from the ev owner s point of view ,",
    "organized recharging and discharging offer the possibility to reduce energy costs or even generate profits .",
    "this paper surveys the charging managements schemes of the literature , with a focus on economy - driven mechanisms .",
    "the proposed models , often based on optimization and/or game - theory tools , range from the simple sharing of a given energy amount among several customers ( a classical problem ) to more complex settings covering aspects such as uncertainty about future events , user mobility constraints , charging station positions , and new grid services like regulation .",
    "while some interesting mechanisms have been proposed , and perform well on simulation scenarios , we observed a quite limited amount of analytical results due to the increasing complexity of the settings ( large number of actors , specific constraints of distribution networks and ev batteries ) and the economic constraints ( nonalignment of actors objectives ) .",
    "hence we think that further research is needed to better understand the key principles to apply when designing charging management schemes .",
    "the present survey highlights the potential of v2 g technology to benefit both ev owners and the grid operator , but also the difficulty of distributing those gains to ev owners to incentivize them to cooperate with the grid operator . from the literature review",
    ", we witness that management of ev charging processes in smart grids has attracted researchers from diverse domains , and we envision more effort will be devoted to this topic .",
    "several research perspectives are promising from our point of view .",
    "firstly , we consider the trend is pointing at microgrids  @xcite , which are systems with multiple distributed generators and consumers that can switch between island mode and connected mode : the presence of evs is likely to increase the autonomy of such systems .",
    "another research perspective regards the charging management of fleets of evs , from a fleet owner perspective .",
    "for example , with the technology of driverless cars getting matured , driverless taxi fleet may emerge , offering new possibilities for charging ( and service providing ) management .    electric vehicles",
    "is an extremely fast - developing field .",
    "technology innovations can reform charging management schemes , for example the roadbed infrastructure would enable charging in motion , which would greatly reduce the reliance on battery capacity and change the understanding ( and modeling ) of  plug - in \" time .",

    "<S> electric vehicles ( evs ) , as their penetration increases , are not only challenging the sustainability of the power grid , but also stimulating and promoting its upgrading . indeed , evs can actively reinforce the development of the smart grid if their charging processes are properly coordinated through two - way communications , possibly benefiting all types of actors .    because grid systems involve a large number of actors with nonaligned objectives , we focus on the economic and incentive aspects , where each actor behaves in its own interest . we indeed believe that the market structure will directly impact the actors behaviors , and as a result the total benefits that the presence of evs can earn the society , hence the need for a careful design . </S>",
    "<S> this survey provides an overview of economic models considering unidirectional energy flows , but also bidirectional energy flows , i.e. , with evs temporarily providing energy to the grid . </S>",
    "<S> we describe and compare the main approaches , summarize the requirements on the supporting communication systems , and propose a classification to highlight the most important results and lacks . </S>"
