    "at the origin of the mathematical theory of distributions ( generalized functions ) which result from the fundamental works of l. schwartz , and also of gelfand and shilov , the so - called `` schrdinger problem '' , or the `` schrdinger conjecture '' , arose in mathematics . in the famous memoir in which schrdinger introduced his equation , he gave definitions of eigenfunctions for the discrete and the continuous spectrum .",
    "he defined the eigenfunctions of the discrete spectrum correctly , whereas the definition of functions corresponding to the continuous spectrum contained an inessential error .",
    "namely , schrdinger assumed that the functions corresponding to the points of continuous spectrum are bounded at infinity .",
    "however , in fact , these functions can have a growth which can not exceed that of some power of @xmath2 , where @xmath2 stands for the radius , as @xmath3 .",
    "i published the related counterexample in 1968 @xcite .",
    "the mathematical proofs of the above conjecture ( such proofs were presented by maurin , kostyuchenko , gelfand , and shilov ) contained errors , which the authors had found themselves when studying my counterexample .",
    "a counterexample in the case of an absolutely continuous spectrum was given in 1993 by the author of the present paper and s.  molchanov and was reported in a plenary talk at the congress on mathematical physics .",
    "the so - called steklov problem for polynomials was solved simultaneously ( in the negative ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "certainly , i had no doubt that schrdinger s definition of eigenfunctions is inexact ; however , i presented the counterexample only after the problem in question passed to the area of mathematics .",
    "the point is that there are many well - known paradoxes in physics . on the contrary",
    ", there must be no paradoxes in mathematics ( in mathematical physics ) .",
    "the well - known gibbs paradox was regarded as a physical paradox , and fifteen nobel prize laureates tried to solve it . however , two famous mathematicians , von neumann and poincar , also tried to solve this paradox . after the exhausting paper by v.  v.  kozlov @xcite , the gibbs paradox finally moved to the mathematical area .",
    "kozlov proved the following fact  @xcite : it follows from the poincar model concerning the dynamics of collisionless gas in a rectangular parallelepiped with mirror walls that , if an interior wall between two parts of the vessel disappears , then the entropy increases stepwise .",
    "however , it is clear that , if we evaluate the density , i.e. , the number of particles in a unit volume , then the entropy , both as the logarithm of the number of possible variants and as the kolmogorov complexity , is preserved .",
    "the problem of correctly defining the notion of ideal gas became now mature in mathematics as well .",
    "it should be noted that the microcanonical gibbs distribution holds ( see theorem  2 ) .",
    "a completely different approach not connected with the microcanonical gibbs distribution was proposed simultaneously by green , kirkwood , and others .",
    "this approach was studied in great detail by n.  n.  bogolyubov .",
    "however , in his construction , bogolyubov used the conjecture of chaos preservation stated by mark kac .",
    "a counterexample to this conjecture was constructed by the author of the present paper and o.  shvedov in @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the bose ",
    "einstein distribution and number theory was studied , in particular , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "let us consider two examples .",
    "as an example of a simple model of bose condensate , consider koroviev s trick ( well known from m.  bulgakov s novel `` master and margarita '' ) of scattering money bills in a variety theater s audience . according to number theory and kolmogorov complexity ,",
    "if koroviev had one million bills and the number of spectators were ten thousand , then only one thousand of them would get bills ( see  @xcite ) . the other nine thousand would not get a single bill ( and presumably would die of hunger ) .",
    "this is exactly a model of bose condensate .",
    "but if the spectators united into groups of ten and agreed to divide the bills between themselves , then , figuratively speaking , no one would die , i.e. , the number of spectators ( or particles ) would be preserved .",
    "but the association of the spectators into groups would mean a constraint on their degrees of freedom , just as the association of particles into clusters .",
    "this leads to two conclusions .",
    "first , from the mathematical point of view , this example is equivalent to the existence of a two - dimensional bose condensate , but this refutes the physicists postulate ( dating back to einstein ) that no two - dimensional condensate does exists .",
    "it turns out that , in the bose ",
    "einstein distribution , it is necessary to add a special term taking into account the fact that the number of particles is finite .",
    "simultaneously , it provides the asymptotic distribution function ( previously not known ) for the number of bills obtained by groups of spectators .",
    "second , the bose condensate can be regarded as an association of dimers , trimers , and clusters , not only of `` frozen ''  particles precipitating to the bose condensate . and this applies to a classical gas , not a quantum , one . thus , under the condition @xmath4 , the bose ",
    "einstein distribution can be regarded as a distribution for a classical gas and the degeneracy temperature as the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "* example 1 .",
    "* by way of an example , similar to approach of molecular dynamics , let us consider a set of unnumbered billiard balls of unit mass and the same color .",
    "first , consider one billiard ball and launch it from some ( arbitrary ) point with velocity not exceeding a certain sufficiently large value @xmath5 , i.e. , with energy not exceeding @xmath6 .",
    "however , since the computer has certain accuracy , it follows that the energy of the ball will take a finite integer number @xmath7 of values in the interval @xmath8 $ ] : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , of energies where @xmath11 corresponds to this accuracy .",
    "thus , we obtain the spectrum of energy values which can be regarded as a self - adjoint diagonal matrix of order @xmath7 , where @xmath12 .    by assigning such a discrete set of energies to a ball , we obtain the wave  particle correspondence in classical mechanics , because the resulting matrix is unitarily equivalent to any operator @xmath13 with such a spectrum in a hilbert space  @xmath14 .",
    "how many balls must be launched so that the computer is not able to determine their initial data ?    the spectrum corresponding to @xmath15 balls can be obtained by considering the tensor product of @xmath15 hilbert spaces @xmath14 and the corresponding spectrum of operator @xmath16 the eigenvalues of this operator are of the form @xmath17 if we only consider the eigenfunctions , symmetric with respect to the permutation of the particles , of this operator , which corresponds to the identity of the balls , then the eigenvalue @xmath18 is of multiplicity equal to the number of all possible variants of the solution of the problem @xmath19    if @xmath20 is the topological dimension , then @xmath21 the binary logarithm of solutions of these diophantine equations is called hartley entropy .",
    "let us consider a problem @xmath22 the entropy of problems   and   coincide up to @xmath23 ( the accuracy up to which we solve these problems ) .",
    "this consideration allows to extrapolate the above theory of integers to non - integral dimensions .",
    "we shall consider relations of the form @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27-function , and the number of solutions satisfying inequality   and equality   for non - integer @xmath20 ( `` fractial dimension '' ) .",
    "since the initial set of energies is `` without preferences '' , i.e. , is in a general position , then all the multiplicities corresponding to ( [ jf_1 ] ) are equiprobable . the computer calculation time is related to the computer accuracy @xmath11 with respect to energy .",
    "the problem is how to determine the number @xmath15 for which , at a particular instant of time , the computer can not recover the initial data in view of inaccuracy of the classical pattern or that of the quantum mechanical pattern ( which is more accurate , but more cumbersome ) ; the latter pattern , in turn , is not accurately described by an interaction of lennard - jones type .",
    "thus , we can draw the following conclusion .",
    "the initial data in classical and quantum mechanical problems are discarded due to external noise . as a result",
    ", the problem is reduced to the distribution of @xmath28 in ( [ jf_1 ] ) . in this problem , we assume _ a priori _ that the initial data are discarded and , therefore , so is the numbering of classical particles .",
    "although the textbook @xcite falsely interpreted the difference between the quantum mechanical pattern and the classical one , it , nevertheless , gave a valid interpretation of the numbering of identical balls .",
    "therefore , we can take symmetric eigenfunctions for @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , it only remains to obtain the distribution of number @xmath30 of particles using relations  ( [ jf_1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath31 , then relation  ( [ jf_1 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath32 these relations coincide with those in the classical number - theoretic problem under the condition that @xmath33 is an integer , which , of course , is of no importance in the asymptotics in @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , since the noise component has prevented us to recover the initial data and the number of particles is preserved and so is the total energy  @xmath36 ( at least , the latter is not increased ) , without giving any preference we assume all the variants satisfying the relation @xmath37 to be equiprobable .    under this approach , we can also take into account collision of billiard balls .",
    "indeed , the initial energy of all balls can only decrease due to friction and the passage of kinetic energy into thermal energy during collisions .",
    "the number of balls will remain the same and the total energy will not exceed the initial energy  @xmath38 .    there is a similar problem in number theory .",
    "let @xmath39 be a positive integer . by a partition of @xmath39 we mean a way to represent a natural number @xmath39 as a sum of natural numbers .",
    "let @xmath40 be the total number of partitions of @xmath39 , where the order of the summands is not taken into account , i.e. , partitions that differ only in the order of summands are assumed to be the same .",
    "the number @xmath41 of partitions of a positive integer @xmath39 into @xmath42 positive integer summands is one of the fundamental objects of investigation in number theory ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    for a given partition , denote a number of summands ( in the sum ) equal to @xmath43 by @xmath44 , the number of summands equal to 2 by @xmath45 , etc . , and",
    "the number of summands equal to @xmath46 by @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 is the number of summands , and the sum @xmath49 is obviously equal to the partitioned positive integer .",
    "thus , we have @xmath50 where @xmath47 are natural numbers not exceeding @xmath42 .",
    "these formulas can readily be verified for the above example . here ,",
    "all families @xmath28 are equiprobable .",
    "a new global distribution for @xmath51 and @xmath48 is determined from the relations @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constants defined from ( [ nt_2 ] ) , @xmath55 is sufficiently large , numbers @xmath39 and @xmath42 are also large , and , by using the euler ",
    "maclaurin summation formula , we can pass to the integrals ( for the estimates of this passage , see  @xcite ) : @xmath56    it can be proved that @xmath57 gives number @xmath58 with satisfactory accuracy .",
    "hence , @xmath59    consider the integral ( with the same integrand as in ( [ kor ] ) ) taken from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and perform the change of variables @xmath62 in the first term and @xmath63 in the second term .",
    "passing to the limit as @xmath64 we derive : @xmath65    on the other hand , making the change @xmath62 in ( [ nt_4 ] ) , we have : @xmath66 relations ( [ nt_5 ] ) and ( [ nt_5 ] )  imply @xmath67    let us now find the next term of the asymptotics by setting @xmath68 using the formula @xmath69 and expanding @xmath70 in @xmath71 we derive @xmath72 thus , we have obtained the erds formula @xcite .",
    "we note that , in the koroviev s trick mentioned above , the problem is put not quite similar to that in number theory on partitions of a positive integer @xmath39 into @xmath42 positive integer summands .",
    "namely , the problem is put in the following way - for a given positive integer number @xmath73 find @xmath74 for which the number @xmath41 of partition variants is maximal .",
    "we have : ( i ) if @xmath75 then the maximal number of variants corresponds to @xmath76 ; ( ii ) if @xmath77 , then the maximal number of variants is achieved for @xmath78 .",
    "this is precisely the bose - condensate ( see @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "* example 2 . *",
    "the above case corresponds to the consideration of the topological dimension @xmath79 consider now the one - dimensional case of a bose condensate , which is important in physical problems . in the notation used in statistical physics",
    ", @xmath36 is the energy , @xmath80 are energy levels , @xmath42 corresponds to a number @xmath15 of particles and @xmath39 corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "define constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 from the following relations : @xmath84 just as in example 1 , we take @xmath85 @xmath15 and @xmath86 to be sufficiently large , @xmath87    first , since @xmath88 we have : @xmath89 for @xmath90 ( corresponding to @xmath57 ) , we obtain the following relation : @xmath91 subtracting @xmath92 from both terms in ( [ nt12 ] ) : @xmath93 and using relations @xmath94 @xmath95 we come to the quadratic equation @xmath96 with respect to @xmath97 , where @xmath98 solving this equation , we obtain : @xmath99 this implies that , for large @xmath39 , @xmath100 where @xmath101    we stress that @xmath90 determines the transition to the bose condensate and plays the same role as @xmath58 ( see ( [ kor ] ) ) in number theory . this problem in number theory",
    "is connected with the waring problem .    *      in statistical calculations of the number of inhabitants in a town ,",
    "the permutation between a child and an old man does not change the total number of inhabitants .",
    "hence , from the point of view of the statistics of the given calculation , they are indistinguishable . from the point of view of the experimenter who observes the molecules of a homogeneous gas using an atomic microscope , they are indistinguishable .",
    "he counts the number of molecules ( monomers ) and , for example , of dimers in a given volume .",
    "dimers constitute 7% in the total volume of the gas ( according to j.m.calo ) .",
    "this means that the experimenter does not distinguish individual monomers just as dimers and counts their separate numbers .",
    "his answer does not depend on the method of numbering the molecules .",
    "these obvious considerations are given for the benefit of those physicists who relate the fact that quantum particles are indistinguishable with the impossibility of knowing the world .",
    "i do not intend to argue with this philosophical fact , but wish to dwell only on mathematics and statistics and distributions related to the number of objects ( compare  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of the @xmath102point in helium-4 is not a quantum effect . according to the experimental data , the compressibility factor @xmath103 decreases to @xmath104 , and hence the fractal dimension decreases to almost 2 ( see below ) .",
    "the derivative of energy with respect to @xmath0 contains the derivative with respect to the chemical potential as a summand .",
    "this term yields a logarithmic singularity as @xmath105 ( just as in  @xcite ) . moreover , if the pressure is equal to approximately @xmath106 atm .",
    ", then there is no singularity in the density of the gas .",
    "an example of a nonholonomic constraint ( cluster ) is a sphere containing another sphere gliding on two parallel - oriented skates fastened to its diameter .",
    "such a collection of gliding spheres inscribed in each other is an example of a nonholonomic cluster . here",
    "the larger sphere must coincide with all the spherical volume of a drop ( see below ) , and the number of spheres must correspond to the number of constraints . as temperature decreases below @xmath107 , there will be an increase in nonholonomic constraint and decrease in the number of degrees of freedom according to the first parameter .    in author",
    "s papers  @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite it is shown that superfluidity is not a pure quantum effect , but a semiclassical one .    by the feynman scheme (",
    "as is well known , he treated a positron as an electron moving back with respect to time ) , a particle which reflected when moving back with respect to time collided at the boundary with a particle which moved directly with respect to time .",
    "these two particles annihilated and gave a part of energy to the boundary .",
    "one can readily imagine what does it mean after processing some film inversely ( back with respect to time ) .",
    "the tangential component , under this understanding of reflection , corresponds to the flow of the `` pair '' along the boundary .",
    "therefore , to take the boundary of the vessel into account ( especially if we consider a gas in which the convection phenomenon takes place ) , we must take the above considerations into account .    from the experiment",
    "it is well known that if the radius of the capillary is increased , then the superfluidity disappears .",
    "namely , it disappears because collisions with the wall lead to a loss of energy .",
    "however , the narrower is the capillary , the higher the first transversal mode occurs in a narrow capillary .",
    "thus , the energy criterion for which the superfluidity disappears depends on the radius of the capillary .",
    "therefore , to explain superfluidity in a vessel , we must proceed with the ultrasecond quantization , and introduce the operators of creation and annihilation of dimers @xcite .",
    "the van de waals law of corresponding states establishes the correspondence between different gases .",
    "the most accurate calculations can be performed using the methods of molecular dynamics , which required a large amount of computer time . moreover , in these methods , it is necessary to know the potential of interaction between particles .",
    "here we use the classical scattering problem to establish the law of correspondence between the given interaction potential and the diagram @xmath108@xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the density and @xmath0 is the temperature .",
    "this was shown heuristically in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the isotropy principle ( of symmetry in all directions ) is one of the key principles of molecular physics .",
    "it must also be formulated rigorously in mathematical terms as the isotropy principle in the theory of kolmogorov turbulence or the born  karman conditions in the theory of crystals ( the problem of the crystal volume finiteness problem ) , especially because of rapid development of the computer molecular dynamics similar to the computer anisotropic turbulence @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the usual argument in molecular physics involves the symmetry of the average motion of the molecules in all six directions .",
    "therefore , @xmath109 of all particles move toward one another . since there are three axes",
    ", it follows that @xmath110 of all molecules collide .    in the two - body scattering problem ,",
    "the lennard - jones interaction potential @xmath111 is usually considered .",
    "here , @xmath60 is an energy of a depth of the well , @xmath112 is an effective radius and @xmath113 is the distance between two particles with radius vectors @xmath114 . in the absence of an external potential",
    ", the two - particle problem reduces to the one - dimensional radial - symmetric one .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , in this problem , two quantities ( energy @xmath115 and momentum @xmath116 are conserved . in the scattering problem , it is convenient to consider , instead of the momentum @xmath117 , another preserved constant , namely , the impact parameter @xmath118 , so that @xmath119 .",
    "the scattering of two particles of equal mass may lead sometimes to the formation of a pair .",
    "if , simultaneously , slight friction or viscosity occurs and a small part of the energy is dissipated to radiation ( of photons ) , to noise ( of phonons ) , then , in this formation , it is natural to preserve the original preserved ( up to infinitely small losses ) quantities : the impact parameter @xmath118 and the energy @xmath115 .",
    "these heuristic considerations led me to the correspondence principle presented below .    at each point",
    "@xmath120 the dressed ( or `` thermal '' ) potential @xmath121 is attractive .",
    "in addition , because the volume @xmath122 is a large parameter , it follows that if @xmath123 is expanded in terms of @xmath124 , then @xmath125 since @xmath126 we can , just as in  @xcite , separate the variables in the two - particle problem and obtain the scattering problem for pairs of particles and the problem of their cooperative motion for @xmath127 .",
    "then , in the two - body scattering problem , an attractive quadratic potential ( inverted parabola ) is added to the lennard - jones interaction potential and the hamiltonian of the scattering problem has the form : @xmath128 where @xmath129 @xmath130 are momenta of two particles with radius vectors @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the effective potential ( for short , we denote @xmath134 . here , @xmath60 is the energy of the well depth , @xmath112 is the effective radius and @xmath135 .    since hamiltonian @xmath14 is equal to the total energy , we have @xmath136 where @xmath118 is the impact parameter . from ( [ jf_9 ] )",
    "we derive : @xmath137 thus , the hamiltonian splits into two parts : @xmath138 and @xmath139 divided by barrier @xmath140 one of them ( for @xmath138 ) is attractive and the other one is repulsive ( for @xmath139 ) . as the repulsive barrier , we can consider precisely that noise which creates infinitely small viscosity or friction",
    ".    for @xmath141 the first term in ( [ ki ] ) is negative while the second term is positive whenever @xmath142 the greater the velocity , the less is the energy .",
    "the mean velocity is the temperature .",
    "however , to study the penetration through the barrier of the incident particle , we must plot @xmath115 along the @xmath143 axis and turn the wells upside down .",
    "then the minimum becomes the barrier and the maximum becomes the depth of the well .",
    "in addition to the attraction problem , there is also the reflection problem for @xmath144 @xmath145 .",
    "it is separated by barrier @xmath146 and creates repulsive particles .",
    "the repulsive particles obstruct the motion of the particles with @xmath147 this is an analog of the reflection that creates `` viscosity '' in a collisionless plasma .    in the two - body scattering problem",
    "considered above , let us analyse the potential energy @xmath148 in the attractive case ( i.e. for @xmath149 here , @xmath60 is the depth of the well , @xmath112 is the effective radius and @xmath118 is the impact parameter . by replacing @xmath150",
    "we get rid of @xmath112 . in what follows ,",
    "both the wave and the prime will be omitted .    for a given @xmath118 and the given potential",

    "further , for a fixed @xmath1 , which is proportional to @xmath166 , we obtain the asymptotic behavior @xmath167 where @xmath118 is the impact parameter , and also the ratio of the difference of the maximal and minimal points of @xmath153 to the maximal point . by our correspondence principle",

    "therefore , it is interesting to compare the data obtained on the basis of the correspondence principle with the corresponding values for gases .    the value of @xmath195 was experimentally determined with a high degree of accuracy and it is @xmath201 for inert gases , nitrogen , oxygen , and propane .    in the correspondence principle given by the author , the value of @xmath202 ( the ratio of the critical @xmath1 to @xmath203 , i.e. , to the whole length of the interval of @xmath1 values , where the zeno line `` cuts off '' the abscissa axis on the graph in fig .  2 coincides with the corresponding values for water , argon , xenon , krypton , ethylene , and a number of other gases .",
    "since the physicists ( with the exception of v.  l.  ginzburg ) did not believe the heuristic considerations that led to this rule of correspondence , let me present detailed calculations to determine the compressibility factor and the analog of the zeno line for an interaction potential @xmath204 of either of the following types - generalized lennard - jones , buckingham , kohara , morse , schommers , barker .    the potential energy has the form @xmath205 the first derivative is @xmath206 the second derivative is @xmath207.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first derivative @xmath208 is equal to zero if @xmath209 the second derivative @xmath210 is equal to zero for @xmath211 in order to define the zeno line , we equate @xmath166 standing in relation ( [ ch4 ] ) , ( [ ch5 ] ) : @xmath212 this results in the following equation : @xmath213 substituting the solution of this equation into relations ( [ ch1 ] ) and ( [ ch4 ] ) , we obtain ( in the parametric form ) curve @xmath214 that , in case of the lennard - jones potential , is represented by the analog of the zeno line .",
    "further , setting @xmath208 to be equal to zero and taking @xmath118 to be sufficiently large ( @xmath193 ) , we get two values of @xmath215 denote by @xmath152 and @xmath151 , where @xmath152 @xmath216 , the values of @xmath153 corresponding to these @xmath2 and consider @xmath217 .",
    "we determine @xmath218 in reduced coordinates by using graphs in fig .  1 for @xmath219 at the point of maximum of the binodal @xmath220 and for @xmath221 .",
    "van der waals wrote his remarkable equation of state with two defining constants @xmath112 and @xmath82 .",
    "however , the lennard - jones potential describing the interaction between particles ( 612 ) and also containing two defining constants does not lead to the van der waals equation either in theoretical calculations  @xcite or in experimental data even for noble ( inert ) gases .    following our ideas based on the analogy with economic laws",
    ", we shall construct equations of state with reference to _ three _ fixed points .",
    "first , consider the irving fisher economic law for assets @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the amount of merchandise in its money equivalent , ( @xmath224 is the merchandise and @xmath223 is its money equivalent ) , @xmath117 is the money supply , and @xmath5 is the velocity of circulation .",
    "suppose that @xmath225 is some original money supply .",
    "( if the fisher law is considered historically , then it is expressed via its gold equivalent . )",
    "let us consider constraints on formula ( [ 87_5_1 ] ) related to the overproduction of merchandise in the form of the following statement .",
    "there exist constants  @xmath112 and  @xmath82 such that , for @xmath226 there is no money supply  @xmath117 satisfying relation ( [ 87_5_1 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , the money supply  @xmath117 satisfying relation  ( [ 87_5_1 ] ) exists only under two conditions : @xmath227 the constraint  ( [ 87_5_2 ] ) is similar to the restriction on the velocity of particles in mechanics .",
    "as is well known , it led to the revision of the newton  galileo mechanics .",
    "now consider the equation of an ideal gas @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the pressure , @xmath122 is the volume , @xmath15 is the number of particles , and @xmath0 is the temperature .",
    "suppose that @xmath230 is the number of particles as @xmath231 , @xmath232 .",
    "then a similar statement is of the form : relation ( [ 87_5_3 ] ) holds only under the condition @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath82 are some constants .",
    "relation ( [ 87_5_3 ] ) for an ideal gas can be represented as @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the density of the gas .",
    "then our constraint can be written as follows :    _ for a given gas , there exist constants @xmath234 and @xmath82 such that if @xmath237 or @xmath238 , then there is no density @xmath1 satisfying relation _ ( [ 87_5_3 ] ) .",
    "this question can be stated differently .",
    "suppose that the pressure @xmath229 and the temperature @xmath0 are given . does there exist a density  @xmath1 satisfying relation ( [ 87_5_4 ] ) for a given imperfect gas ( or a mixture of gases ) ?",
    "in modern theory of imperfect gases , it is usual to consider the plane @xmath239 and , in this plane , condition ( [ 87_5_3 ] ) corresponds to the so - called zeno - line , which , as given by experiment , is a segment of the straight line @xmath240 where @xmath241 , @xmath200 are constants ( the constant @xmath200 is called the `` boyle temperature '' ) .",
    "this dependence was first noticed by bachinskii , who justified it empirically .",
    "let us present the modern general scheme for an imperfect gas in the plane @xmath242 .    as was already pointed out by the author @xcite , the thermodynamic equations of state containing the quantities : @xmath229 , the pressure , @xmath0 , the temperature , @xmath243 , the chemical potential and , respectively , @xmath122 , the volume , @xmath244 , the entropy , @xmath15 , the number of particles , constitute a three - dimensional lagrangian manifold in the six - dimensional phase space ; moreover , @xmath245 @xmath246 @xmath243 play the role of coordinates , while @xmath122 , @xmath244 , @xmath15 , respectively , play the role of the corresponding momenta .",
    "therefore , for a fixed number of particles @xmath15 , the diagram on the plane @xmath247 given in fig .  1 is the projection on one of the planes of the phase space .",
    "under such a projection , focal and caustic points appear .    the slanting line issuing from the boyle point in fig .",
    "1 is called the zeno line and is of the form ( [ 87_5_5 ] ) .    in studying the pressure as a function of the density @xmath1 ,",
    "an ambiguity arises on the zeno line : @xmath248 hence the quantity @xmath249 takes two values for @xmath250 and becomes complex for @xmath238 , a typical simple caustic ( or the turning point in the one - dimensional quantum schrdinger equation ) .",
    "first , let us describe the distribution for @xmath252 .",
    "our distribution contains multiplication by a function of @xmath122 , i.e. , the following change occurs in the bose ",
    "einstein distribution : @xmath257 the index @xmath258 is sometimes omitted , and hence here it is constant .",
    "this function is constant for a given dimension .",
    "therefore , @xmath259 obtained for @xmath260 has the form @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the riemann function .              on the zeno line  , substituting   and , we obtain the second relation for @xmath279 under the additional initial condition that @xmath280 as @xmath281 .",
    "the first - order differential equation is obtained in parametric form ( here @xmath83 is a parameter ) .",
    "the function @xmath277 allows us to determine the critical dimension @xmath20 , and hence @xmath282 as follows from   with @xmath283 .",
    "therefore , @xmath284 gives us the solid curve in fig .",
    "5 , which is in a good agreement with experimental values for the argon gas component ( for @xmath285 ) .",
    "the formula for imperfect gas is @xmath291 where @xmath292 is determined by the equation @xmath293 the results of computations by the last formula coincide with experimental graph in fig .  6 for @xmath286 up to the point @xmath294 .      , @xmath161",
    ", @xmath0 is the temperature in kelvin degrees , @xmath297 is the volume in @xmath298 , @xmath299 is the gas constant , and @xmath300 is the compressibility factor .",
    "the isochores @xmath301 are shown by dotted lines.,width=419,height=295 ]      the compressibility factor @xmath103 in this distribution is determined as the following relation @xmath302 where @xmath303 , @xmath304 .",
    "hence , the fractal dimension @xmath20 is uniquely determined for @xmath305 .",
    "if we assume that the parameters @xmath306 , @xmath243 , @xmath307 , and @xmath258 are mutually related by the condition that the number @xmath308 of versions of the solution of the diophantine equations for @xmath38 and @xmath15 must increase maximally , then this means that the `` specific entropy '' @xmath244 , i.e. , the entropy used in number theory , takes the maximum values . since @xmath309 where @xmath310 is a polylogarithm .",
    "the condition that there is a relation between @xmath243 and @xmath258 completely determines the curve @xmath286 in fig .",
    "the same holds for the curves @xmath311 .",
    "we write the system of equations @xmath312 the limit point is determined by the condition @xmath313 : @xmath314 and the constant is determined by the relations on the zeno line ( see fig .  8) .",
    "the other boundary conditions are determined by the curve in fig .  3 for @xmath315 .",
    "using the dependence @xmath316 ( @xmath317 ) on the thin curve for @xmath318 ( we mean that , on this curve , @xmath83 is zero ) and the dependence on the zeno line , we obtain that for @xmath319 the variables @xmath277 depend on @xmath258 without a boundary condition of the type   ( for @xmath320 the variables @xmath277 do not depend on @xmath258 ) .",
    "the boundary condition is adjusted so that the above relations and the continuity condition are satisfied .",
    "since it turns out that @xmath327 is close to unity , we present a figure , where @xmath258 linearly depends on @xmath122 , and compare it with the experimental values on the plane @xmath328 .",
    "the character of the behavior of @xmath329 and the fluid incompressibility effect as @xmath330 ( the jamming effect ) can already be seen in this approximation ( fig .",
    "7 ) .    for @xmath331 ,",
    "the jamming effect already takes place , and this permits improve the binodal , i.e. , the phase equilibrium curve . for @xmath332 , the function @xmath284 is obtained , and hence all quantities determined by the potential @xmath253 , can also be determined .      on the phase equilibrium curve , we know the gas pressure and temperature .",
    "they are equal to the pressure and temperature of the liquid phase . for @xmath334 , the picture shown in fig .",
    "8 takes place , where @xmath1 and @xmath0 do not vary along the rays and are determined on the zeno line .    ,",
    "formula degenerates , and the rays @xmath335 stick into the zeno line according to formula  . it follows from condition that , for @xmath336 , the relation between @xmath243 and @xmath258 are such that @xmath337 for a fixed  @xmath0 .",
    "condition with ( 11 ) for @xmath338 taken into account implies a shift in @xmath243 of order @xmath339 .",
    "this transition on an enlarged scale can be obtained from and ( 11 ) . ]    since , for the gas branch , we determined the value of  @xmath0 in the triple point , the corresponding value of @xmath1 for the liquid phase we obtain from the equilibrium condition . thus , we obtain @xmath340 , @xmath341 , @xmath342 .",
    "this allows us to introduce one more critical point for the liquid phase and to find @xmath343 , just as this was done in the case of gas phase , which means that a new potential @xmath344 can be introduced in the liquid phase .",
    "this is an important fact , useful in liquid dynamics ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "since , in this domain , @xmath1 and @xmath345 are related by @xmath346 , where @xmath347 , it follows that the decrease in the fractal dimension is determined by the increase in the value of density  @xmath1 , and hence also by the increase in the pressure .",
    "the constant  @xmath234 is determined by the condition @xmath348 .",
    "the increase in the pressure can be calculated by the successive approximation method .",
    "in addition , our distribution must be consistent with the zeno line , which is valid , according to experiments , for a wide range of spectra of different gases .",
    "let us show this using an example ( given below ) .",
    "however , the main thing is that , in our distribution , the dimension is a given function of the density @xmath1 .    below the condensate point , for @xmath349 ,",
    "the angle of rotation depends on @xmath350 for @xmath351 .",
    "this is a fairly complicated transformation . nevertheless ,",
    "since it occurs in the plane @xmath352 @xmath353 , it does not involve the coordinates @xmath246 @xmath354 and preserves the lagrange property , because , in the two - dimensional phase space , any smooth transformation preserves the lagrange property and the coordinates @xmath246 @xmath354 remain unchanged .",
    "it is important that @xmath244 is still the logarithm of the number of possible variants .",
    "let us now pass to the projection of the two - dimensional manifold ( obtained above ) in the six - dimensional space on the four - dimensional phase space .",
    "the equality @xmath4 cuts a two - dimensional surface out of the three - dimensional lagrangian manifold .",
    "the following group property holds : as @xmath15 is changed @xmath42-fold , so are the quantities  @xmath122 and  @xmath244 .",
    "this implies that this manifold is cylindrical .",
    "therefore , it can be projected along  @xmath243 and  @xmath15 from the six - dimensional phase space on the four - dimensional space , where the explicit action determining the lagrangian manifold is the gibbs potential @xmath355 .",
    "since we have @xmath356 , this equality cuts out a two - dimensional cylindrical ( by the group property ) manifold depending on the parameter @xmath357 . projecting it along  @xmath15 and  @xmath243",
    ", we obtain a two - dimensional manifold in the four - dimensional phase space  @xmath358 .",
    "first , consider this projection using @xmath359 as an example .      from ( [ jf_20 ] )",
    "expressing @xmath243 as a function of  @xmath229 and @xmath0 : @xmath364 , we obtain the potential @xmath365 and relations @xmath366 this gives rise to a potential of the type of the gibbs potential @xmath367 determining the lagrangian manifold non - uniquely projected onto the plane @xmath245 @xmath0 .",
    "the usual rule is used for the selection of points at which different branches of the projections are joined .",
    "the `` quantization '' of thermodynamics is carried out by the tunnel canonical operator , as was described in @xcite .",
    "just as above , we can project the lagrangian manifold ( after the rotation ) in transformed ( with respect to @xmath122 and @xmath229 ) coordinates along @xmath243 and @xmath15 on the four - dimensional phase space . since the projection does not depend on the order of transformation of the coordinates @xmath229 and @xmath122",
    ", it follows that the same transformation can be performed after the projection .",
    "the fact that the potential `` mixed '' from the free energy and the thermodynamic potential arises can easily be explained ; see the heuristic example given in @xcite .",
    "the phase transition in liquids is treated there as the creation of `` three - dimensional '' clusters or domains , as the author called them , in which there exists a particle surrounded on all sides by other particles ( constituting a small coordination sphere ) .",
    "since , as is well known , @xmath103 begins on the @xmath368 coordinates , we can use the dependence ( given above ) up to @xmath182 and then include the thermic potential , because we must also take into account the influence of a third particle . as was already stated in previous papers ,",
    "the dressed , or `` thermic , '' potential  @xmath369 is attractive .",
    "the `` mixture '' of statistics allowed us to solve the famous problem of gibbs paradox as a contradictory example in the system of phenomenological axioms of thermodynamics .",
    "as poincare noted , we turned to `` arithmetics '' to solve this problem and used the mixture of the statistic from the number theory and the usual statistic .",
    "in numerous attempts to solve this problem were base on the use of a mixture of particles  @xcite and their internal structure .",
    "the fact that there are foci at the critical point and the zeno line is stable ( i.e. , the compressibility factor is equal to unity ) allowed us to do this .",
