    "heat conduction in low dimensional systems has attracted increasing attention @xcite in recent years . after two decades analytic and numerical studies in 1d model , much progress has been achieved . on the one hand ,",
    "the study has enriched our understanding about the underlying physical mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "the study has made it possible to seek the practical application of heat control and management .",
    "indeed , in 2002 , terraneo et al @xcite proposed a thermal device which can rectify the heat current through it when reversing the temperature gradient .",
    "the model proposed by terraneo et al is a 1d anharmonic lattice consisting of three segments with the morse on - site potential of different parameters . as the first attempt of controlling heat current ,",
    "the ratio of the thermal current changes is less than two .",
    "more recently , li et al .",
    "@xcite construct a thermal diode model in which two frenkel - kontoroval ( fk ) chains with different nonlinear strengths are connected by a harmonic spring .",
    "the most successful improvement of the model by li et al @xcite lies in three facts : first , the configuration is more simple , it consists of only two different segments ; second , the ratio of heat current from two different directions is increased drastically about 100 times ; third , the underlying mechanism of thermal rectifying effect is explained by illustrating the phonon bands of the particles in different segments .",
    "following li et al s work , we further improve the rectifying efficiency from 100 to 2000 by substituting the weak fk chain with a fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) chain @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the rectifying effect ( asymmetric heat flow ) is closely related to asymmetric interface thermal resistance ( also called kapitza resistance ) .",
    "moreover , a specific relationship between the ratio of heat current and the overlap of the phonon spectra is demonstrated numerically .",
    "the rectifying effect can also be achieved by modulating the periodicity of the on - site potential of the fk lattice @xcite .",
    "the above works demonstrate the possibility of controlling heat current by changing structures / parameters of anharmonic lattices .",
    "these might find potential application in energy saving material .",
    "however , almost all works so far are focused on 1d system of finite size .",
    "obviously , much progress has been achieved , but the final purpose is to put these ideas to application .",
    "it is thus a nature step forward to seek effective thermal devices to control heat current in higher dimension .",
    "the open questions are : whether the heat control mechanism in 1d is still valid for the high dimension(s ) and whether the extra dimension(s ) reduces the rectifying efficiency ?",
    "the answer might not be trivial , as in higher dimension the lattice vibration includes not only the longitudinal one but also the transverse ones .",
    "the longitudinal modes will couple to the transverse modes @xcite , which might affect the rectifying efficiency .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate our study on a 2d rectifier model",
    ". we will demonstrate with numerical evidence that a 2d rectifier can be built up and it works in a very wide temperature range .",
    "the 2d thermal rectifier shows similar behaviors with 1d thermal rectifier under similar parameters regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as the follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe our model and numerical method used for the computer simulation . in section iii ,",
    "we demonstrate and discuss the dependence of the thermal rectifying efficiency on the temperature and the temperature gradient .",
    "section iv is devoted to the interface thermal resistance which is the key point to understand the thermal rectifying effect . in section",
    "v , we give physical understanding of the rectifying effect in terms of the lattice vibration spectra ( also called phonon band . )",

    "when the vibration spectra overlap with each other , the system behaves like a thermal conductor , while the system behaves like a thermal insulator when the vibration spectra are separated .    physically , whether an excitation of a given frequency can be transported through a mechanical system depends on whether the system has a corresponding eigenfrequency .",
    "if the frequency matches , the energy can easily go through the system , otherwise , the excitation will be reflected . in our system",

    "if the vibrational spectra of two parts are separated , then the excitation at any part can not be transported to another part , because there exists no such corresponding frequency in another part .    the change from overlap to separation",
    "is induced by the different temperature dependence of the vibration spectra of the two segments , which is a general feature of any anharmonic lattice .    in fig[fig : spectra ] , we show the vibration spectra of the fk part and the fpu part under different temperatures .",
    "we can see that the vibration spectra of the fk part broaden from high frequency to low frequency when increasing the system temperature .",
    "this is because at low temperature , the atoms of the fk model is confined at the valley of the on - site potential , thus the atoms oscillate in very high frequency , however , when the temperature is increased , more and more low frequency modes can be excited . in the limiting case ,",
    "when the temperature is larger enough that the kinetic energy of the atom is much larger than the on - site potential , then the fk model becomes a chain of harmonic oscillators which has frequency @xmath150 $ ] .    on the contrary ,",

    "in fact , we have shown @xcite that the highest oscillation frequency of the fpu model depends on temperature , @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , in some settings , the vibration spectra of the fk part and the fpu part will overlap with each other , while in other temperature settings , they will separate with each other .",

    "the comparison of vibration spectra of the fk part at two different temperature ranges and the fpu part at the full temperature range from 0.01 to 0.12 are shown in fig[fig : overlap ] a and fig[fig : overlap ] b separately .",
    "we can see that the vibration spectra of the fk part and the fpu part are matched with each other when the temperature of the fk part is from 0.05 to 0.12 ( see fig[fig : overlap ] a ) .",
    "the vibration spectra of the two parts are separated from each other when the temperature of the fk part is from 0.01 to 0.03 ( see fig[fig : overlap ] b ) .",
    "this indicates that when the temperature of the fk part is below a certain value , which we call @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) , the system will behave like a thermal insulator since the separated vibration spectra of the interface particles make the heat conduction almost impossible .",
    "when the temperature of the fk part is above the critical point @xmath152 , the system will be a good thermal conductor since the matched vibration spectra allow the heat flow .",

    "the op is affected by the boundary condition and the number of particles , @xmath73 , along @xmath25 direction .",
    "the op shifts to lower temperature when increasing @xmath73 or changing the periodic boundary condition to the free boundary condition along @xmath25 direction .",
    "the 2d thermal rectifier has a good rectifying efficiency in a very wide temperature range .",
    "another important factor that affects the performance of the thermal rectifier is the temperature difference between the two ends .",
    "we find the rectifying efficiency increases approximately as an exponential law in certain temperature range with the temperature difference .",
    "the rectifying efficiency is mainly determined by the asymmetrical itr .",
    "the study on the itr shows the similar behavior with heat current .",
    "the behaviors of the itr and heat current of the system are strongly correlated with vibration spectra of the particles beside the interface .",
    "the asymmetry behavior of itr and heat current is induced by the different temperature dependence of the vibration spectra of the two parts beside the interface .",
    "we find the vibration spectra of the fk part broaden from high frequency to low frequency , conversely , the vibration spectra of the fpu part broaden from low frequency to high frequency as the temperature increases .",
    "the different temperature dependence of vibration spectra makes the system transition from a thermal conductor to an insulator possible by setting the system temperature and temperature difference properly .",
    "moreover a specific relationship between the performance of the system and the convolution of the vibration spectra of the two parts is found numerically as power law .",
    "our study on 2d thermal rectifier gives a very clear picture about how the system responds to the environment changes .",
    "the results should be useful for further experimental investigation .",
    "the thermal diode constructed by a monolayer thin film or a tube like structure might have many practical applications .",
    "we would like to thank wang lei for helpful discussions .",
