    "the recent development in database technology has allowed researchers to extract very large data sets of human interaction sequences .",
    "these large data sets are suitable to the methods and modeling techniques of statistical physics , and thus , the last years has witnessed the appearance of an interdisciplinary field between physics and sociology  @xcite .",
    "more specifically these studies have focused on network structure  in what ways the networks of social interaction deviates from completely random networks , and how this structure can emerge from individual behavior .",
    "most of these recent large - scale social network studies have focused on networks of accumulated relationships . in many cases ,",
    "the social network of interest is rather the network of ongoing social relationships : the dynamics of the spreading of diseases  @xcite , opinion formation  @xcite , and fads  @xcite are often rather fast compared to the evolution of the network  in such cases inactive relationships have no relevance . in social search processes",
    "@xcite , distant acquaintances can be helpful , but not all acquaintances a person has ever had .",
    "we also believe the network of ongoing contacts lies conceptually closer to the colloquial idea of a network of friends , than what the network of actors and their accumulated contacts do .",
    "furthermore , traditional social network studies ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) based on interviews or field surveys has mapped out ongoing contacts . the complication , and probably the reason earlier studies have focused on the network of accumulated contacts , is that the time of a tie s cessation is less clear - cut than its beginning .",
    "however , if the sampling time of the data set is very large compared to the network dynamics ; then one can , at a time @xmath0 in the interior of the sampling time span , approximate the network of ongoing relationships by the network of contacts that has occurred and will occur again . in the present paper",
    "we use this method to study the structure and structural fluctuations of networks of ongoing relationships . to justify that the sampling time is long enough compared to the time evolution of the network , we investigate the temporal structure of the relationships .",
    "the data sets we use are obtained from scientific collaborations  @xcite , email exchange  @xcite and interaction within an internet community  @xcite .",
    "all our data sets take the form of lists of triples , or _ contacts _ , @xmath1 meaning that @xmath2 and @xmath3 has interacted at time @xmath0 . for the scientific collaboration networks the two first arguments are unordered , for the other two networks the interaction is directed .",
    "we call the set of contacts with the same two first elements ( neglecting the order ) a _ relationship _ between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . our approximation of the graph of ongoing contacts at time @xmath0 is then defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the set of vertices ( or actors ) that occur in a contact at a time earlier than @xmath0 , and @xmath6 is the set of unordered pairs of vertices @xmath7 where there exist contacts between @xmath2 and @xmath3 at times @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .

    "@xcite ( but sampled one year longer ) .",
    "this data is extracted from the preprint repository arxiv.org where scientists themselves can upload manuscripts .",
    "an edge between @xmath2 and @xmath3 means that @xmath2 has appeared as a coauthor of a preprint together with @xmath3 .",
    "the time the manuscript is uploaded is the time we say the collaboration has occurred .    the email network is the same data set as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and consists of all in- and out - going email traffic to a server handling undergraduate students email accounts in kiel , germany .    the internet community network is constructed from the same data set as in ref .",
    "here an edge represents any of four different ways of contacts between users of the swedish internet community pussokram.com .",
    "this community is intended for romantic communication among adolescents and young adults .    for the email and pussokram.com networks",
    "one can define a direction for the contacts . in the study of network structure , however , we will consider the contacts as bidirectional .",
    "statistics for the networks are presented in table  [ tab : stat ] .",
    "before we investigate the approximate network of ongoing contacts , as defined above , we discuss the speed of interaction and the validity of the approximation .",
    "first , we focus on the distribution of response times @xmath11times between consecutive contacts of different direction within a relationship . for the undirected e - print data we simply define @xmath11 as the time between consecutive uploads of e - prints within a relationship .",
    "we measure the @xmath11-distribution of the data sets , @xmath12 , and also a quantity @xmath13 where the effects of the finite size effects are compensated for .",
    "an earlier study  @xcite has found a power - law like @xmath11-distribution . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resp](a ) this picture is confirmed in the large scale .",
    "this stretched functional form makes the finite sampling time a problem as it imposes a cut - off on the recorded distribution @xmath12 . to compensate for this and construct a better approximation @xmath13 to the real distribution",
    ", we use the formula @xmath14 $ ] also ends within @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the statement that the response time is @xmath11 .",
    "now @xmath17 is just the frequency distribution of interval length as measured during the sampling . to find @xmath18 we note that , if we assume that contacts occurs with a constant rate ( which is reasonable in a long term perspective for a system of a relatively constant number of actors ) , then a response interval ends within @xmath15 with probability @xmath19 however , the sizes of the communities need not to be time independent . for response intervals involving an actor that enters the system at time @xmath0 eq .",
    "( [ eq : pr1 ] ) becomes @xmath20 .",
    "now we approximate the time an actor @xmath21 enters the system with the first time @xmath22 that @xmath21 is involved in a contact , and get the formula : @xmath23    \\label{eq : prcond}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the heaviside function , and @xmath25 is a normalizing constant .",
    "@xmath13 is plotted , along with the @xmath12 values that differs most from @xmath13 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : resp](a ) ( here @xmath25 is chosen to make @xmath13 coincide with @xmath12 for small @xmath11 values rather than to normalize @xmath13 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath13 is straighter than @xmath12 in the log - log scale ( for at least the e - mail and pussokram.com curves ) , which suggests a power - law like behavior over a considerable range .",
    "( of course there is eventually a cut - off  from the human life time , if nothing else . )",
    "the e - print curve has a peculiar bend as it seems to shift exponent around @xmath26 , an observation we hope future studies can explain .",
    "there is a conspicuous irregularity around @xmath27 for the e - mail and pussokram.com curves .",
    "this was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite and explained as an effect of people s everyday routines ",
    "the kiel students read and reply their e - mails at the same hour as the day before , the pussokram.com members log in after school or work , and so on .",
    "this effect is more visible in a linear scale , see figs .",
    "[ fig : resp](b ) and ( c ) . for the e - mail curve",
    "the peak at seven days is larger than the surrounding peaks , indicating that some emails are associated with weekly routines among the kiel students and their contacts .",
    "this one - week - peak can not be seen in the pussokram.com curve ; possibly reflecting that business ( or university studies ) has more weekly scheduled routines than leisure do .",
    "now we turn to the more central question about the speed of relationship cessation .",
    "our central quantity is the number of relationships existing at time @xmath28 that still remains at time @xmath0 ( we assume @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 .",
    "this quantity can crudely be approximated with the number of relationships at @xmath0 that existed at @xmath28 that will occur again before @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the error in the approximation will be rather large for @xmath0 close to @xmath31 .",
    "but , just as above , one can improve the approximation considerably . if one assumes that the response time distribution @xmath33 applies to all relationships regardless if the relationship is new or old ; then , during a time interval @xmath34 , the change of @xmath35 can be written : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the probability that a relationship , that has its last recorded contact at time @xmath0 , actually continues after @xmath31 : @xmath38 where the sum is over the bins of the @xmath33 histogram .",
    "a change of variables gives : @xmath39 and finally a formula for integrating @xmath35 : @xmath40 we also need the factor @xmath25 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : prcond ] ) which is hard to estimate since we do nt exactly know @xmath33 s long term behavior",
    ". however , we note that for certain @xmath25 the @xmath41 curves are rather straight in a lin - log plot , see fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] ( as opposed to the e - mail and pussokram.com curves the e - print curve decays so slowly that a power - law form of @xmath41 can not be ruled out ) .",
    "this means that the characteristic duration time is well - defined  fitting to an exponential @xmath42 ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the two degrees of freedom ) gives the characteristic durations @xmath44 of relationships displayed in table  [ tab : stat ] . to be able to approximate",
    "the network of ongoing contacts with the network of contacts that have happened and will happen again one would like @xmath45 to hold .",
    "we see that for the pussokram.com data @xmath31 is about four times as large as @xmath44 which enables us to draw some conclusions using this approximation .",
    "the effective sampling times of the e - print and e - mail data are , however , so short that we exclude these for the latter section of this paper .",
    "now we take a brief look at the time evolution of the network sizes@xmath46 , the number of active actors at time @xmath0 , and @xmath47 , the number of edges in our approximate network of ongoing relationships . if the number of active users increases during the sampling period , the time evolution of @xmath46 and @xmath47 should be right - skewed , and this is indeed true for the e - print data ( as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : size](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the e - mail and pussokram.com curves are more symmetric ( the pussokram.com curve is indeed slightly left - skewed ) .",
    "we note that for pussokram.com , @xmath47 is much less than @xmath48 .",
    "the kinks of the e - mail curves are due to group or spam e - mails , the other quantities @xmath47 , @xmath13 and so on , are not affected by this .",
    "now we turn to the structure of the network of ongoing contacts , and the fluctuations of the structural measures . in this section",
    "we only use the pussokram.com data ( due to , as mentioned above , the large effective sampling time for this data set ) .",
    "we focus on three quantities that recently have received much attention : the first structural measure is the distribution of degree ( number of edges to a vertex ) .",
    "the first quantity is the clustering coefficient @xmath49 where we use the traditional sociological definition @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of representations of every 3-cycle ( triangle ) of @xmath52 is a triangle , then @xmath53 another representation of the same triangle .",
    "so the number of distinct triangles is @xmath54 . ] and @xmath55 is the number of representations of 3-paths .",
    "the second quantity is the assortative mixing coefficient  @xcite @xmath56 where averages are taken over @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the degrees of an edge s first and second arguments as they appear in @xmath57 .    the cumulative degree distribution of our approximate network of ongoing relationships , along with the corresponding data for the network of accumulated contacts is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : s](a ) . just as for the accumulated network ,",
    "our approximate network of ongoing relationships has a fat tailed degree distribution ; but the network of ongoing relationships fits better to a single power - law with . the stronger downward bend of @xmath60 for accumulated social contacts has been observed earlier  @xcite ; maybe this larger correction to a power - law form is due to inactive edges .",
    "we note that even if the degree distribution fits very well to that of the barabsi - albert model  @xcite , the central ingredient in the barabsi - albert model ( the `` preferential attachment '' ) does not apply directly to the pussokram.com community .",
    "preferential attachment means that a vertex acquires new edges with a rate proportional to its degree , but in the pussokram.com community the degree of a member is invisible to others  @xcite .",
    "next we turn to the time evolution of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : s](b ) and ( c ) these are displayed for the whole sampling time .",
    "the earliest and latest times can , of course , be affected by the proximity to the borders of the sampling time frame  for our discussion we focus on the interval @xmath63\\approx [ 129,383]\\:\\mathrm{days}$ ] .",
    "we see that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are of the same order of magnitude for the networks of ongoing and accumulated contacts .",
    "these values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are rather neutral in the sense that they can be expected from a random network with a skewed degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations are rather large , especially for the clustering coefficient ( with a standard deviation of around half the average value ) .",
    "an intriguing question for future studies is how dynamical systems on the networks are affected by strong structural fluctuations . slightly outside our interval , at @xmath64 there is an upward jump in both @xmath61 ( from @xmath65 to @xmath66 ) and @xmath62 ( from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ) that is the result of a new contact between two of the most central actors .",
    "such a new edge introduces a new triangle for every common neighbor of the two vertices , and can thus increase @xmath61 substantially as two high - degree actors may have many neighbors in common .",
    "such an event will , by definition , also give a large positive contribution to the assortative mixing .",
    "we can expect sudden jumps in many structural quantities for networks of ongoing relationships with fat tailed degree distributions , as the rare event of an edge appearing or disappearing between two of the most connected vertices will affect many structural measures ( various kinds of centrality measures  @xcite are probably even more sensitive to such events ) .",
    "unfortunately the sampling time is too short , despite the fast pussokram.com dynamics , to get good statistics for the autocorrelation function of @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( it is consistent with a characteristic time of decay similar to @xmath44 ) .",
    "in this paper we investigate networks of ongoing contacts from three large sets of social interaction data .",
    "we study the response time distribution and distribution of relationship duration .",
    "we reanalyze these quantities to compensate for the finite sampling time by supposing that the response time distribution is the same for all relationships , and the same throughout the duration of the relationship .",
    "we find a response time distribution that has a power - law like shape in the large scale , but has an informative small - scale structure reflecting the daily and weekly routines .",
    "the distribution of relationship duration is consistent with an exponential decay .",
    "this indicates that there is a well - defined characteristic duration time of a relationship , @xmath44 ; and that if @xmath44 is much less than the sampling time @xmath31 the network of ongoing contacts can be reasonably well approximated by the network of contacts that have happened and will happen again . for one of our data sets  that of the internet community pussokram.comwe have @xmath71 . for this data set",
    "we compare the approximate network of ongoing contacts with networks of accumulated contacts  the common way of constructing social networks from interaction data .",
    "we find a degree distribution that fits much better to a power - law for the network of ongoing contacts than the network of accumulated contacts .",
    "the clustering coefficient and assortative mixing coefficients are of the same order ; which , to some extent , justifies the use of network of accumulated contacts as a proxy for networks of ongoing contacts .",
    "the fluctuations in these quantities are , however , rather large . a fact that may have important consequences for dynamical systems .",
    "we hope these results will inspire more extensive longitudinal studies of interaction networks with fast dynamics , as well - converged data for relationship duration distribution and autocorrelation functions of structural quantities are within reach .",
    "we also point out the interplay between dynamical systems on the networks and the structural fluctuations as an interesting area of future studies .",
