    "binary mixtures of small and large particles with sufficiently large size disparity , at low or moderate concentrations of the small particles , exhibit a large separation in the time scales for both components .",
    "recent computational investigations in polymeric and non - polymeric mixtures of soft spheres @xcite in such conditions have reported anomalous relaxation features at intermediate intervals of more than three time decades between the short - time ballistic and long - time diffusive regimes .",
    "these anomalous features are : i ) sublinear power law behaviour for mean squared displacements , with decreasing exponent by decreasing temperature , ii ) logarithmic relaxation in dynamic correlators , iii ) concave - to - convex crossover in dynamic correlators by tuning the relevant control parameter .",
    "these results exhibit striking analogies with predictions of the mode coupling theory ( mct ) for state points close to higher - order mct transitions @xcite , which arise in regions of the control parameter space where competition between different mechanisms for dynamic arrest takes place . for the fast component in binary mixtures",
    "we have suggested a competition between confinement and bulk - like caging @xcite , respectively induced by the host matrix formed by the slow component , and by the surrounding particles belonging to the fast component .",
    "this view is supported by the observed non - trivial analogies @xcite with a recent mct theory for fluids confined in matrixes with interconnected voids @xcite , for which a higher - order point has been explicitly derived .",
    "striking analogies with anomalous relaxation features in short - ranged attractive colloids are also observed . for these latter systems",
    "a higher - order mct transition has been derived as the result of a competition between steric repulsion and reversible bond formation for dynamic arrest @xcite .",
    "kinetically constrained models @xcite are used as coarse - grained pictures for relaxation in supercooled liquids . in these models",
    ", the liquid structure is substituted by an array of cells .",
    "the cell size roughly corresponds to a density correlation length .",
    "a spin variable is assigned to each cell , with values 0 or 1 denoting respectively unexcited and excited local states in a mobility field .",
    "changes in local mobility ( spin flips ) for a given cell are permitted according to kinetic constraints determined by the mobilities of the neighbouring cells .",
    "propagation of mobility , which yields structural relaxation , occurs via dynamic facilitation : microscopic regions become temporarily mobile only if neighbouring regions are mobile .",
    "kinetically constrained models provide in a simple way an important feature exhibited by glass - forming liquids : the growing of dynamic correlation lengths by decreasing temperature , leading to dynamic heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "some of the anomalous dynamic features exhibited by short - ranged attractive colloids , and associated with a higher - order point within the framework of mct , as logarithmic relaxation or reentrant behaviour of the diffusivity @xcite , have been recently reproduced by a simple model based on dynamic facilitation @xcite .",
    "motivated by this fact and by the mentioned dynamic analogies with binary mixtures , we investigate a simple kinetically constrained model aimed to reproduce qualitative relaxation features for such mixtures . in section 2 we introduce the model and give computational details .",
    "simulation results are presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "we have carried out monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on a variation @xcite ( see below ) of the north - or - east - or - front ( nef ) model recently investigated by berthier and garrahan @xcite . in these three - dimensional model directionality in the kinetic constraints",
    "is imposed to mimic fragile liquid behaviour @xcite .",
    "spin flip of a given cell is only permitted if there is at least one excited neighbouring cell in the north - or - east - or - front direction . more specifically , if the cell is denoted by its position vector @xmath0 ( @xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 )",
    ", spin flip is permitted according to the following rules :    \\i ) at least one of the neighbouring cells in the north ( @xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath4 ) , or east ( @xmath1,@xmath5,@xmath3 ) , or front ( @xmath6,@xmath2,@xmath3 ) direction is excited , i.e. , it has spin 1 .",
    "\\ii ) if i ) is fulfilled , spin flip is accepted according to the metropolis rule @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath7 is always accepted , while @xmath8 is accepted with a thermal probability @xmath9^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the temperature .    in the present work",
    "we investigate a binary mixture of cells with the same population of excitations , @xmath9^{-1}$ ] , but different rates for excitation , @xmath11^{-1}$ ] , and decay , @xmath12 , of the cell mobility .",
    "this choice fulfills detailed balance .",
    "we use the activation energies @xmath13 0 and 3 for the different components , which are respectively denoted as `` fast '' and `` slow '' cells . hence , spin flip rules for the fast component are the same as in the original nef model , aimed to reproduce bulk - like dynamics .",
    "the probability of spin flip for the slow cells is decreased by a factor @xmath14 as compared to that of the fast cells , providing a large time scale separation for relaxation of both components ( see below ) .",
    "the mixture composition , @xmath15 , is defined as the fraction of fast cells .",
    "we investigate a wide range of composition and temperature as control parameters .",
    "a square box of side @xmath16 cells is used .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are implemented .",
    "slow and fast cells are randomly distributed according to the selected value of @xmath15 .",
    "time is given in mc steps .",
    "within each mc step a total of @xmath17 trials ( one trial for each cell ) is performed .",
    "the configuration of the mobility field at times @xmath18 and @xmath19 is defined as that respectively before and after the @xmath17 trials .",
    "we have evaluated the mean squared displacement according to the definition given in ref .",
    "a `` probe molecule '' placed in a given cell @xmath20 at time @xmath18 is permitted to perform a jump @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , to an adjacent cell @xmath23 provided that _ both _ @xmath20 and @xmath24 are instantaneously ( i.e. , at the same time @xmath18 ) in an excited state . otherwise the jump is not permitted .",
    "if in the former case there are several candidates between the adjacent cells , one of them is randomly selected .",
    "the mean squared displacement is computed from an average over the trajectories of different ( non - interacting ) probes initially placed in different cells . in the case of the binary mixture investigated in this work , only jumps between cells of a same component ( `` fast '' @xmath25 `` fast '' or `` slow '' @xmath25 `` slow '' ) are permitted . in this way the motion of a probe initially placed in a cell of a given component remains coupled to the mobility field of that component .",
    "1 shows , at a fixed composition @xmath26 , results for the mean squared displacement computed according to this procedure .",
    "the short - time ballistic regime exhibited by real systems is obviously absent due to the coarse - grained character of the model .",
    "a large time scale separation is induced between both components at low temperatures . in analogy with the behaviour displayed by binary mixtures with large size disparity @xcite ,",
    "an intermediate sublinear power law behaviour is observed for the fast component , and the corresponding exponent decreases by decreasing temperature .",
    "the latter takes a value of about 0.6 at the lowest investigated temperature .    .",

    "dashed lines correspond to slow cells ( same temperatures as for the former ones , decreasing from top to bottom ) .",
    "solid straight lines indicate linear or sublinear power law behaviour ( exponents are given ) . ]",
    "[ fig1 ]    we have also computed the mean persistence function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the persistence function of the cell @xmath20 at time @xmath18 . the latter takes the value 1 if no spin flip has occurred for that cell in the interval [ 0,@xmath18 ] .",
    "if one or more spin flips have occurred , it takes the value 0 . according to the picture of dynamic facilitation ,",
    "the decay of @xmath30 is a signature of structural relaxation @xcite . fig .",
    "2 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath30 at composition @xmath26 .",
    "the first decay usually observed for any correlator in real systems corresponding to the transient regime at microscopic times is again absent due to coarse - graining .",
    "as for the mean squared displacement , the introduction of very different rates for cell spin flip yields very different relaxation times for fast and slow cells .",
    "while slow cells display standard relaxation , fast cells exhibit rather different relaxation features . in full analogy with results for dynamic correlators of the fast component in binary mixtures @xcite , @xmath30 shows a concave - to - convex crossover by decreasing temperature . at an intermediate temperature , pure logarithmic relaxation",

    "[ fig3 ]    it is worthy of remark that the features displayed in figs .",
    "2 and 3 are not specific of @xmath30 .",

    "the fact that recent work within this approach @xcite also reproduces unusual relaxation features for short - ranged attractive colloids suggests that dynamic facilitation is a relevant ingredient for relaxation in systems with several competing mechanisms for dynamic arrest .",
    "results reported here provide a new step to extend the picture of dynamic facilitation , which had been used basically for describing bulk - like relaxation , to more complex situations .",
