    "the high degree of tunability and control associated with cold - atomic gases  @xcite has motivated an explosion of theoretical activity involving the study of dynamics of interacting quantum systems .",
    "several interesting problems could be studied in these systems such as quantum quenches ( see ref .   and references therein ) and other classes of steady - state nonequilibrium phenomena such as systems subjected to a time dependent noise .",
    "@xcite in all these situations one of the fundamental questions is what is the steady - state of the system , and in particular whether the system can thermalize .",
    "not surprisingly in such a difficult problem , exactly solvable models and integrable systems have proven to be a good playground to address these issues .",
    "the study of quench dynamics in many integrable systems reveal that the large number of conserved quantities in the system prevents the system from thermalizing . instead",
    "the long time behavior of the system is characterized by time - dependent or time - independent nonequilibrium states .",
    "@xcite often after a time - averaging , the resultant steady - state can be described by a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) constructed from identifying the conserved quantities of the system .",
    "@xcite however the generality and applicability of the gge remains under debate since not all observables can be described by it .",
    "@xcite    besides a lack of complete understanding of the long time behavior of integrable and even some exactly solvable models after a quench , the more complex question of how the presence of non - trivial interactions that cause scattering and/or break integrability affect the behavior is largely open . numerical studies on finite systems show that for large enough breaking of integrability , thermalization is associated with a change of the level statistics from poisson to wigner - dyson ,  @xcite with the onset of thermalization occurring via a two - step process , where in the first step the system is trapped for a long time in a nonequilibrium prethermalized state .",
    "@xcite at the same time , fluctuations in a finite - size system also play an important role  @xcite so that generalization of numerical results to systems in the thermodynamic limit may not be straightforward .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to address some of these questions in precisely this limit of long times and infinite system size where numerical studies are hard .",
    "in particular we study an exactly solvable model which is in a nonequilibrium steady - state due to an initial quench , and explore the stability of the resulting athermal state to non - trivial interactions that generate mode - coupling .",
    "the effects of mode - coupling will be treated within a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",
    "while there are many candidate models to study this physics , due to experimental relevance , and its relative simplicity , we choose to study a one dimensional system of interacting bosons , leading to the so called luttinger liquid physics .",
    "@xcite the excitations of such a system can be represented by density modes , which are essentially independent .",
    "on such a system , quenches corresponding to a change of the interaction reveal a steady - state which still has independent modes , but these are now characterized by a nonequilibrium distribution that does not relax to a thermal state .",
    "@xcite note that we use the term `` steady - state '' to reflect the fact that averages of various physical observables reach a time - independent value at long times after the quench .",
    "we study the effect of a mode coupling term , such as one generated by a periodic potential , on this steady - state .",
    "we assume that the periodic potential has been switched on very slowly , so that in the absence of the initial quench , the system reaches the ground state in the presence of the periodic potential .",
    "the results are presented in the parameter regime where the periodic potential is ( dangerously ) `` irrelevant '' so that a perturbative rg approach remains valid at arbitrary length - scales .",
    "we find that infinitesimally weak potentials or mode - coupling can generate an effective - temperature and cause the system to _ asymptotically _ thermalize .",
    "in addition , and somewhat unexpectedly a dissipation is also generated .",
    "thus we find that the effective low energy theory at long times after the quench is a quadratic theory of thermal bosons with a finite lifetime .",
    "this asymptotic thermalization and dissipation occurs because the low frequency and momentum modes can transfer energy to the higher energy modes ( which are gradually eliminated in the rg procedure ) .",
    "these high energy modes thus act as a bath , providing thermalization and dissipation .",
    "the dissipation thus shares features with landau damping where plasmons acquire a finite lifetime .",
    "@xcite it also shares similarities with turbulent systems that are known to exhibit the well known kolmogorov cascades where energy is passed down from large scale structures to small scale structures .",
    "@xcite we believe that this type of behavior and mechanism for thermalization , unraveled in a controlled way on the particular system we study , is quite general .",
    "a short account of some of these results was given in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper we give a detailed derivation of the above results and in particular discuss the general derivation of the rg equations using the keldysh approach which may be adapted to study other types of out of equilibrium bosonic systems .",
    "we build on the results of ref .   to derive new results .",
    "in particular we show that the rg flow can be significantly modified by different quench protocols .",
    "we also examine the behavior close to the critical point where the external potential becomes relevant . in this limit various peculiarities such as singular behavior of the expansion in spatial and temporal gradients of the bosonic field are encountered .",
    "in addition we present a detailed discussion of the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem of the post - quench system by studying the frequency dependence of two point correlation functions showing that even though the system appears `` thermal '' in low energy scales , the crossover from low to high energies is still complicated .",
    "it should be noted that some rg based approaches to study quenches already exist in the literature .",
    "for example the flow equation method was used to study quenches in a fermi liquid  @xcite and in the quantum sine - gordon model ,  @xcite where for both cases a long - lived prethermalized regime was found .",
    "rg was also used to study the a classical two - dimensional sine - gordon model after a quench .",
    "@xcite here the effective temperature due to the quench was found to generate a dynamical vortex binding - unbinding transition , but unlike the quantum 1d problem studied in ref .   and this paper ,",
    "no dissipation was generated .",
    "furthermore , the system that we study also shares many common features with a luttinger liquid subjected to a nonequilibrium noise source ,  @xcite where the particular form of the noise in our system arises due to the out of equilibrium occupation of the bosonic modes after the quench .",
    "it is thus interesting to make a connection between the quench problem where in the asymptotic the system is free , and systems where an external noise source is constantly imposed on the system , and is found to exhibit similar properties.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] the basic model and notation is introduced and the equilibrium properties of the relevant response and correlation functions are discussed . in section",

    "the solution of the rg equations are presented , and in section  [ action ] the resultant low energy theory near the fixed point is discussed . finally in section  [ summ ]",
    "we present our conclusions and discuss open questions .",
    "the hamiltonian for interacting bosons in a periodic potential is @xmath0   \\label{hsg}\\\\ & & v_{sg } = - \\frac{gu}{\\alpha^2}\\int dx \\cos\\left(\\gamma \\phi(x)\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the quadratic part which describes the luttinger liquid or long lived sound modes .",

    "( [ phfp ] ) shows that the equal - time two - point function @xmath249 decays exponentially in position , with a decay rate given by the effective - temperature , @xmath250 @xmath251    an interesting question concerns the relation between the generated dissipation and the effective - temperature . for a fermi - liquid for example @xmath252 .",
    "it is interesting to explore to what extent our system mimics such a behavior .",
    "[ fermi ] shows the plot of @xmath235 as a function of @xmath236 where @xmath253 , the latter being the appropriate energy scale that determines the decay of the two - point functions .",
    "the @xmath254 indicates that the values at the fixed point have been taken .",
    "[ fermi ] corresponds to @xmath68 and a quench from @xmath189 to @xmath255 .",
    "notice the coincidence of the plots for two different values of @xmath19 indicating that the dissipation scales as @xmath256 .",
    "however , for small quenches , the behavior is not fermi - liquid like as the dissipation increases as @xmath257 with @xmath258 . for larger quenches ,",
    "the relation between @xmath109 and @xmath21 becomes non - monotonic ( not shown ) as @xmath21 always increases with @xmath58,whereas @xmath109 eventually decreases as @xmath19 becomes more and more irrelevant .",
    "in this paper we have explored how out of equilibrium quantum systems can thermalize in the presence of mode - coupling terms .",
    "we have analyzed in detail a situation in which a system of interacting bosons is set out of equilibrium by a sudden interaction quench . in ref .   and the current paper we have shown , using a controlled rg procedure , how mode - coupling or interactions which give rise to nontrivial scattering between modes affect this nonequilibrium state .",
    "the main result is that even when the mode - coupling is `` irrelevant '' , it generates an effective - temperature and a dissipation .",
    "the generation of a dissipation indicates that thermalization eventually sets in by the exchange of energy between low energy modes and high energy modes .",
    "the flow of energy across different length scales is also found in nonequilibrium classical systems such as turbulence  @xcite and the classic fermi - pasta - ulam problem .",
    "@xcite such a flow of energy can lead to cascades and universal power - law behavior in the distribution function , a result which has also been recovered in recent studies involving nonequilibrium bose - einstein condensates .  @xcite it is clear that exploring further the connection between these systems should prove to be a very fruitful line of study .",
    "this also points to quite a general mechanism for thermalization in which mode coupling allows the system itself to act as a reservoir for the low energy part of the degrees of freedom ( see fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "this subpart thus acquires a classical behavior in the sense that it is characterized by a finite dissipation and a finite temperature .",
    "it is important to contrast this to a standard equilibrium quantum system for which the temperature is the same irrespective of the energy of the mode considered , here the temperature can only be defined if the limit @xmath212 is taken . the frequency dependence will in general be complicated and",
    "will correspond to a crossover between the athermal and the ( low energy ) thermal state .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the approach we have employed with more traditional methods to study dynamics .",
    "when studying fermions , a natural route is to write a kinetic equation that systematically takes into account two and if needed three particle scattering processes .",
    "however for the luttinger liquid which has a linearized spectrum , a description in terms of a kinetic theory fails . in particular a naive perturbation theory about",
    "the luttinger liquid fixed point leads to divergent results .",
    "this has been attempted in the past ( see ref .   for a discussion on this point ) . while our approach is perturbative in the periodic potential , since the basic unit of our perturbation theory involves the correlators @xmath259 , we have explictly taken into account multiple scattering between bosons .",
    "there are of course many open problems .",
    "it is in particular important to extend the analysis of the present paper close to the critical point and also to the region in which the mode coupling term is perturbatively relevant .",
    "although we could obtain in the present paper some results close to the critical point , the whole rg procedure has to be made fully consistent by taking into account the temperature and dissipation to obtain a more complete description .",
    "treating these effects in a self - consistent way is hard .",
    "once such a scheme is developed , it would be interesting to study the strong - coupling part of the phase diagram .",
    "it is clear that numerical studies of these questions would also be extremely helpful in this regime .    given the close analogies between fermions and bosons in 1d , exploring the above physics in fermionic systems is an important direction .",
    "a first step was undertaken in ref .   where an rpa study of a system of fermions that are out of equilibrium due to an initial quench was done , and overdamped collective modes were recovered .",
    "however , a more complete study is needed that takes into account backscattering interactions ( which are not included in the rpa ) .",
    "further , we have assumed that the term that generates mode - coupling was switched on very slowly .",
    "how the physics is affected by the rate at which the mode - coupling is turned on is also interesting to explore .    finally checking the generality of this mechanism , by introducing other non - linear terms , such as those arising due to band - curvature , is of course a very interesting question",
    "this is also directly relevant for a test of the present mechanism either in numerical simulations or in experiments . on a practical point",
    "there is also the question of time - scales and which non - linear couplings are more efficient than others . in experiments in david weiss s group ,",
    "@xcite where there is currently no optical potential , a prethermalized gge type state is found to persist for long times despite non - linearities arising due to effects such as band - curvature .",
    "this might be because the time - scales for the onset of dissipative and thermal effects due to these couplings are too long for experimental relevance .",
    "however we expect that application of a periodic potential will induce these effects more efficiently as a periodic potential is ( dangerously ) irrelevant .",
    "once an experiment with an optical lattice is realized , a probe of the density - density response functions which directly correspond to the correlators @xmath260 that we have evaluated , should exhibit dissipative and thermal effects .",
