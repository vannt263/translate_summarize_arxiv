    "as is well - known , power spectra of voltage fluctuations in all conducting media exhibit a universal low - frequency behavior  for sufficiently small frequencies @xmath5 they scale as @xmath6 with the frequency exponent @xmath1 about unity .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is a manifestation of the so - called flicker noise present in any system containing free - like charged particle states @xcite .",
    "although the value of @xmath1 and an overall proportionality factor in this power law depend on many factors such as sample material and sample geometry , system temperature , etc . , there are some important characteristic properties possessed by all flicker noise power spectra .",
    "namely , it is well established experimentally that the noise produced by a biased sample is proportional to the voltage bias squared , and roughly inversely proportional to its volume .",
    "the enigmatic property of the @xmath7-spectrum is its unboundedness .",
    "flicker noise is present in the whole measured frequency band covering more than twelve decades .",
    "experiments show no flattening of the spectrum for frequencies as low as @xmath8 although on the opposite side of the spectrum the @xmath7-component is dominated by other types of noise ( it compares with thermal noise usually at @xmath9 ) , it has been detected at frequencies as high as @xmath10    despite numerous models suggested since its discovery eighty years ago @xcite , the origin of flicker noise still remains an open issue .",
    "there is a widespread opinion that this noise arises from resistance fluctuations , which is quite natural taking into account its dependence on the applied bias .",
    "it has been proposed that the resistance fluctuations possessing the other properties of flicker noise might result from temperature fluctuations @xcite , fluctuations of the charge carrier mobility @xcite , or of the number of charge carriers @xcite .",
    "all these models , however , have restricted validity , because they involve one or another assumption specific to the problem under consideration .",
    "for instance , assuming that the resistance fluctuations arise from temperature fluctuations , one has to choose an appropriate spatial correlation of these fluctuations in order to obtain the desired profile of the power spectrum .",
    "in addition to that , some models involve artificial normalization of the power spectrum , needed to come up with the observed noise level .",
    "perhaps the main difficulty for theoretical explanation is the unboundedness of flicker noise spectrum .",
    "there are many physical mechanisms that generate noise whose power spectrum has the @xmath7-profile in some frequency domain .",
    "but these domains are so narrow in comparison with the whole measured band that the corresponding mechanisms can not be considered as the general mechanisms of flicker noise generation .",
    "for instance , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , defect motion in carbon conductors generates noise with power spectrum close to the inverse frequency dependence in the frequency range @xmath11 to @xmath12 while outside this interval it switches to @xmath13 at the same time , the omnipresence of flicker noise and high universality of its properties suggest that there must exist an equally universal reason for its occurrence .",
    "this source is naturally expected to have a quantum origin .",
    "although some of the models suggested so far do consider various quantum effects as underlying mechanisms of flicker noise ( such as , for instance , trapping of charge carriers ) , it may well be that its origin is to be sought at the most fundamental level .",
    "namely , it is plausible that the phenomenon of flicker noise has its roots in the very quantum nature of interaction of elementary charges with electromagnetic field . from this point of view",
    ", the problem has been attacked by handel @xcite , who suggested that flicker noise is the result of low - energy photon emission accompanying any scattering process , and is related to the infrared divergence of the cross - section considered as a function of the energy loss .",
    "later , the argument was modified and the so - called coherent quantum @xmath7 effect described @xcite , which is connected with the infrared properties of the dressed electron propagator .",
    "although handel s theory has been severely criticized in many respects @xcite , it has found support in independent investigations of refs .",
    ".    an essentially different quantum approach to the problem was proposed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "flicker noise is treated as originating from quantum fluctuations of individual electric fields of charge carriers . as was shown in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , spectral density of the two - point correlation function of the coulomb field produced by a charge carrier exhibits the above - mentioned characteristic properties of flicker noise .",
    "namely , the low - frequency asymptotic of the spectral density is @xmath14 the noise intensity induced by external electric field is proportional to the field strength squared , and inversely proportional to the spatial separation between the field producing particle and the observation point . in application to the case of a conducting sample",
    ", the low - frequency asymptotic of the voltage fluctuation power spectrum is found to be @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the voltage bias , @xmath17 the system temperature , @xmath18 the fine structure constant , @xmath19 the charge carrier mobility , @xmath20 the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath21 a geometrical factor which is roughly inversely proportional to the sample size .",
    "the range of validity of this result turns out to be notably wide : the term `` low - frequency asymptotic '' means that for a given @xmath22 eq .  ( [ mainhomr ] ) is valid for frequencies satisfying @xmath23 with @xmath17 expressed in @xmath24 covering well the whole band where flicker noise has ever been observed , this condition in particular sets no low - frequency cutoff , implying that the @xmath7-spectrum extends down to zero .",
    "the fact that the found asymptotic does not require a low - frequency cutoff is the consequence of its oddness with respect to frequency . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , appearance of such contributions to the spectral density is related to the inhomogeneity in time of fluctuations produced by individual charge carriers , and provides a natural resolution to the problem of divergence of the total noise power .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that eq .",
    "( [ mainhomr ] ) is in agreement with the experimental results of @xmath7-noise measurements in metals .",
    "naturally , in this comparison only genuine @xmath7 noise data were used , i.e. , the data that fit the law @xmath0 in which @xmath25 within experimental error .",
    "experiments show , however , that generally power spectra follow the one - over - f law only in sufficiently thick samples , while in thin samples ( films , whiskers ) large deviations of @xmath1 ( up to @xmath26 ) are often observed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that these deviations can be described within the developed theory by taking into account backreaction of the conducting medium on the fluctuating electric field produced by a charged carrier .",
    "staying within the one - particle picture of flicker noise generation , developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , this backreaction can be described as an effective reduction of the momentum space dimensionality .",
    "it turns out that this reduction can be naturally realized using the well - known techniques of dimensional continuation @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the power spectrum of electromagnetic fluctuations , continued in this way to @xmath27 adequately describes the observed properties of flicker noise spectra in metal films .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the effect of the backreaction on photon propagation in a conducting film is discussed in sec .",
    "[ exchangeint ] . in sec .",
    "[ heatbath ] , the influence of the heat bath on quantum propagation of electromagnetic and charged field quanta is considered , and the contributions relevant in the low - frequency regime are identified .",
    "the power spectral functions of the coulomb field and voltage fluctuations are defined in sec .",
    "[ prelim2 ] , and written down in the form convenient for explicit calculations .",
    "power spectrum of electromagnetic fluctuations in the presence of external electric field is evaluated in sec .",
    "[ calcul ] .",
    "the low - frequency asymptotic of the voltage power spectrum is found to obey the @xmath0-law with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the effective dimensionality of momentum space .",
    "application of the obtained result to solids and comparison with experimental data is given in sec .",
    "[ applications ] . some important auxiliary material used in the main text",
    "is collected in two appendices .",
    "appendix  a contains the proof of gauge independence of the voltage correlation function .",
    "derivation of the dimensionally reduced photon propagator in the axial gauge is given in appendix  b.    units in which @xmath30 are used throughout this paper except the end of sec .",
    "[ calcul ] and sec .  [ applications ] .",
    "the spacetime metric @xmath31 is defined mostly negative , i.e. , @xmath32",
    "consider a conducting film , i.e. , a sample which is thin in one , say , @xmath33-direction .",
    "the film will be assumed homogeneous in @xmath34-plane , but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "let the film be in a constant homogeneous electric field parallel to the @xmath34-plane , and denote @xmath35 the voltage measured between two leads attached to the film at the distance @xmath36 which is much larger than the film thickness @xmath37 we are interested in quantum properties of the electromagnetic field produced by a charge carrier moving in the film at finite temperature @xmath38 specifically , finite - temperature correlations in the values of the particle s coulomb field in the presence of external electric field will be investigated .",
    "as long as backreaction of the conducting medium on the fluctuating field of the charged particle is neglected , these correlations are a single - particle effect , in the sense that to the leading order in the electromagnetic coupling , only fields produced by one and the same particle correlate . however , this is no longer the case upon account of the backreaction .",
    "the point is that under usual conditions of flicker noise measurements , the backreaction is to be considered as an effect of zero order in the electromagnetic coupling . indeed , since the characteristic time of the charge density response to the field fluctuation is much smaller ( normally , by ten orders of magnitude at least ) than the time @xmath7 of the field measurement , this response can be considered quasi - stationary , leading to one and the same charge density redistribution independently of the value of charge carried by elementary medium constituents .",
    "since these redistributions tend to compensate the field fluctuation , the backreaction leads to damping of the electric field fluctuation .",
    "concerning their effect on quantum propagation of the particle s field , significance of these redistributions depends on the mechanism governing the response . from this standpoint ,",
    "response of the medium through the ordinary electric conduction is inconsequential because this is a classical effect , in the sense that it relates quantities averaged over many decoherent particles  the mean electric field and mean electric charge density .",
    "things differ , however , upon account of specifically quantum mechanisms such as the exchange interaction between charge carriers .",
    "since this interaction is independent of the particle charge , it changes the structure of electromagnetic correlations already at the lowest order .",
    "this interaction leads to correlations of changes in the charge density distribution , induced by the fluctuating electric field of the given particle .",
    "being related to the symmetry properties of the charged particles state , the exchange interaction leads to density correlations which are coherent , and therefore so is the response of the medium on the fluctuating field .",
    "it is important that the charge carriers correlated this way react coherently on each single photon propagating in the medium , thus changing quantum properties of this propagation .",
    "in other words , the exchange charge density correlations modify the form of the electromagnetic field propagator .    for definiteness , in the rest of this section we consider metal conductors .",
    "since electronic component in metals is degenerate at ordinary temperatures , for a rough estimate of the exchange effect it will be sufficient to use the simplest model of ideal degenerate fermi - gas of neutral particles .",
    "it is known @xcite that the exchange correlations of density fluctuations in this case are destroyed by the thermal effects at distances @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath41 the particle mass ( for distances @xmath42 density correlations fall off exponentially as @xmath43 ) . for electrons in a metal",
    ", @xmath40 can be estimated as @xmath44 @xmath45 being the lattice spacing , and hence @xmath46 at shorter distances , the correlation function of density fluctuations scales as @xmath47 and at @xmath48 fluctuations become completely correlated .",
    "thus , one can expect that the propagation of photons polarized in the @xmath33-direction will be partially suppressed by the exchange effects in films with thickness @xmath49 and damped almost completely in the case @xmath50 this applies to the real transversely polarized photons as well as to the longitudinal `` photons '' describing coulomb fields of charged particles .",
    "let us turn to the consequences of this damping regarding the form of the electromagnetic field propagator , @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the usual time ordering of field operators , and averaging is over the given photon state ( equilibrium distribution at temperature @xmath17 ) .",
    "the quantum suppression of the @xmath33-component of the electric field means that the electromagnetic field operator @xmath53 is constrained by the condition @xmath54 at the same time , it is well known that the form of the photon propagator is to a certain extent arbitrary .",
    "this arbitrariness reflects the freedom in choosing gauge conditions used to fix the gradient invariance . on the other hand ,",
    "it is proved in appendix  a that the voltage correlation function is gauge - independent , so the choice of the gauge is at our disposal . in the present case ,",
    "it is convenient to choose the axial gauge @xmath55then the above operator constraint simplifies to @xmath56this condition means that the normal mode decomposition of the scalar potential does not contain wave vectors with nonzero @xmath33-component . thus , in this particular gauge , the suppression of @xmath57 implies that the `` temporal '' photons do not propagate in the @xmath33-direction .",
    "in other words , the momentum space propagator of these photons becomes effectively two - dimensional .",
    "it is important , furthermore , that the complete photon propagator turns out to be diagonal in the axial gauge under the condition ( [ azero ] ) .",
    "namely , the zero - temperature photon propagator is found in appendix  b to have the following form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the unit vector in the @xmath33-direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the finite - temperature propagator is also diagonal ( see the next section ) . in view of this fact",
    ", @xmath60 turns out to be the only component of the photon propagator that determines the power spectrum of voltage fluctuations produced by nonrelativistic charge carriers .",
    "this is because whenever @xmath61 is contracted with the electromagnetic current @xmath62 contribution of the components with @xmath63 is suppressed by the factor @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the charged particle momentum , so that @xmath66 in what follows , therefore , we will be dealing only with this component of the photon propagator , and drop the lower lorentz indices , for brevity .",
    "our choice of units @xmath30 still leaves freedom in choosing the unit of length .",
    "it proves to be convenient to fix it by setting @xmath67 which will be assumed until the end of sec .",
    "[ calcul ] .",
    "let us now consider the influence of the heat bath on the photon and charged particle propagation . as long as the mean electric potential produced by an elementary charged particle",
    "is considered , the photon heat bath has no effect .",
    "this is because the 4-vector of momentum transfer to a free massive particle , @xmath68 is always spacelike , @xmath69 so the distribution of real photons appearing in the definition of the photon propagator is irrelevant .",
    "the consequence of this is that the quantities built from the mean field , such as the disconnected part of the correlation function , are not affected by the photon heat bath .",
    "things change , however , when the connected part of the two - point correlation function of electric potential is considered .",
    "it is defined by the following symmetric expression @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the spacetime coordinates of two observation points , @xmath73 is the scalar potential operator in the heisenberg picture , and @xmath74 denotes the given _ in _ state of the system `` charged particle + electromagnetic field . ''",
    "in the two - photon processes , photon momenta are allowed to take on lightlike directions , and hence the photon heat bath does contribute to the function @xmath75    as is well - known , the ordinary feynman rules of the s - matrix theory are not generally applicable for the calculation of _ in - in _ expectation values , and must be modified , e.g. , according to schwinger and keldysh @xcite .",
    "this complication was overcome in @xcite by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) in the form @xmath76 which allows the use of the s - matrix rules .",
    "this transformation uses equivalence of the one - particle _ in _ and _ out _ states ( and the hermiticity of the electromagnetic field operator ) .",
    "thus , in order to calculate the _ in - in _ expectation value ( [ corr ] ) taking into account the heat bath effect , the standard finite - temperature - field - theory techniques can be used @xcite .",
    "below we employ a version of the real time formalism , developed in @xcite , which is especially convenient in actual calculations since the momentum space propagators in this formulation do not involve the step function .",
    "the real time formulation involves doubling of all fields , which will be specified by a two - valued lower index . according to the diagrammatic rules derived in @xcite ,",
    "the photon propagator at finite temperature can be obtained in momentum space ( of arbitrary dimensionality ) by replacing the quantity @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ zerotphotonpr ] ) by the following matrix @xmath78 where @xmath79 in applications to the problem of @xmath7-noise considered below , the value of the product @xmath80 turns out to be very small .",
    "for instance , even for frequencies as large as @xmath81 and temperatures as small as @xmath82 it does not exceed @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is the boltzmann constant ) , so the denominators in the above expressions can be replaced by @xmath85 implying that the second term in @xmath86 dominates . on the other hand , the temperature effect on the propagation of massive particles is much less prominent .",
    "for instance , in the case of conduction electrons in a crystal ( this case will be used throughout as a standard example ) , the particle energy is of the order @xmath87 setting @xmath88 we find that @xmath89 with @xmath17 expressed in @xmath24 hence , the temperature contribution can be completely neglected ( for fermions as well as for bosons ) , and the propagator taken in the simple diagonal form @xmath90 this is for a scalar particle described by the action @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the particle charge .",
    "account of particle spin , though adds some extra algebra , does not change the long - range properties of its field , so that following ref .",
    "@xcite we work with the simplest case of zero - spin particles .",
    "the matrix propagators are multiplied in the interaction vertices , generated by the triple and higher order terms in the lagrangian , with an additional minus sign for the product of 2-components , as in the schwinger - keldysh techniques .",
    "the arguments of the green functions are treated as 1-component fields .",
    "finally , external particle lines represent normalized particle amplitudes or their conjugates , according to whether the particle is incoming or outgoing , just like in the conventional techniques .",
    "as was mentioned above , the photon propagator is dominated by the temperature contribution ( as long as the range of momentum integration contains lightlike directions , see discussion in sec .",
    "[ calcul ] ) , while in the massive particle propagator this contribution is negligible .",
    "it is important , on the other hand , that the heat bath affects significantly the real particle propagation , i.e. , external matter lines in the diagrams .",
    "bilinears of the particle amplitudes representing these lines are expressed eventually via statistical distribution function ( see sec .",
    "[ calcul ] for details ) .",
    "thus , apart from explicit @xmath17-dependence coming from the photon propagator , the correlation function also depends on temperature implicitly through the particle statistical distribution .",
    "connected contribution to the power spectral density of electric potential fluctuations is obtained by fourier transforming eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) with respect to the difference of the time instants @xmath93 : @xmath94 the upper and lower indices in the notation of the correlation function are suppressed in the left hand side , for brevity .",

    "( [ corr2 ] ) , ( [ corrf ] ) , it is convenient to perform the fourier transformation under the sign `` re '' in eq .",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce fourier transform of the two - point green function : @xmath110 with the help of which the power spectrum of potential fluctuations can be written as @xmath111 we see that contributions to the function @xmath112 and hence to the voltage power spectrum , can be either real even , or imaginary odd functions of frequency .",
    "in this section , spectral density of the voltage correlation function will be evaluated in the low - frequency limit taking into account the finite - temperature effect and the influence of constant homogeneous external electric field .",
    "let us first discuss the role of the particle collisions in this calculation .",
    "it was mentioned in sec .",
    "[ exchangeint ] that , barring the exchange interaction , correlations in the values of the electromagnetic fields produced by the charge carriers is a one - particle effect within the leading order in the electromagnetic coupling , in that only fields produced by one and the same particle correlate .",
    "at the same time , in the presence of the external electric field the direct particle interactions can not be neglected completely . indeed , although this field leads to a relatively small corrections to the charge carrier wave function and its propagator in all practically relevant cases , the effect of constant homogeneous field on the free - like particles can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "the role of the particle collisions is to prevent the charge carrier from gaining too much momentum from the field , thus cutting down its effect .",
    "this is pictured schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the particle collisions are symbolized by a virtual photon interchange between the particles . the external field and",
    "the collisions affect both the particle wave function and its propagator . as to the former , account of these two factors",
    "is accomplished by replacing the particle momentum probability distribution by the statistical distribution function , obtained as a solution of the kinetic equation in the presence of external electric field ( this point will be discussed in more detail later in this section ) . regarding the particle propagator , however , the issue is not that simple , because in order to extract the low - frequency asymptotic of the power spectrum one needs an explicit expression for the propagator , incorporating both effects , which is unknown .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by the following trick . as was mentioned above",
    ", the external field gives rise only to a relatively small correction to the particle propagator .",
    "it is , therefore , sufficient to determine this correction in the linear approximation , i.e. , to the first order with respect to the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "we now make an assumption ( confirmed by the result of the calculation ) that the low - frequency asymptotic of the power spectrum is independent of the charge carrier mass .",
    "then this asymptotic can be found formally in the large mass limit . for a given frequency @xmath113",
    "one can always take the mass large enough so as to justify perturbative treatment of the external field effect .",
    "to the first order in the electromagnetic coupling , corrections to the particle propagator due to external electric field and particle collisions are well - separated from each other because they are superimposed linearly . on the other hand ,",
    "since the characteristic time of particle collisions is very small , their contribution to the particle propagator is inconsequential in calculating the low - frequency asymptotic of the power spectrum .",
    "thus , the lowest order contribution to the correlation function is represented by diagrams with a single insertion of the vertex describing interaction of the charged particle with external electric field .",

    "it is important , on the other hand , that time homogeneity is not necessarily exhibited by individual contributions to the total voltage fluctuation , whatever mechanism of flicker noise generation be . in particular",

    "however , this summation is not the only way to obtain a stationary correlation function symmetric in @xmath285 another possibility , which is realized in the present paper , is that flicker noise may be a one - particle phenomenon , in the sense that the entire effect can be ascribed to elementary fluctuations produced by single charge carriers . in this case",
    "the function @xmath281 does not have to depend solely on @xmath284 and as the explicit calculations of sec .",

    "as was mentioned above , elementary processes are inhomogeneous in time , and hence the symmetry with respect to @xmath286 imposes no restriction on the @xmath208-dependence of the correlation function .",
    "the only remaining requirement , namely reality of the correlation function , implies that contributions to the spectral density must be real even , _ or _ imaginary odd functions of frequency [ cf .",

    "[ heatbath ] ] , or in the ordinary units , @xmath290 with @xmath17 expressed in @xmath24 we see that from the practical point of view , the obtained spectrum has no upper cutoff either .",
    "let us continue verification of the obtained result and show that eq .",
    "( [ mainhom ] ) is in agreement with the other experimentally established properties of flicker noise .",
    "we will first discuss some general qualitative properties of flicker power spectra , predicted by eq .",
    "( [ mainhom ] ) , and then give a detailed quantitative comparison of these predictions with experimental data .",
    "first of all , the power spectrum of quantum electromagnetic fluctuations , given by eq .",
    "( [ mainhom ] ) , is quadratic in the applied bias .",
    "this is perhaps the most solidly established property of flicker noise .",
    "second , the noise level is generally inversely proportional to the sample size .",
    "namely , the @xmath21-factor describing dependence of the noise intensity on the sample dimensions increases roughly as a power of decreasing sample length or thickness , the exponent depending on the sample geometry as well as on the effective sample dimensionality @xmath29 ( which itself depends on the sample thickness . ) as to the dependence of flicker noise amplitude on sample dimensions , agreement in the literature is not that good .",
    "experiments are usually arranged so as to prove one of the two main competing points of view on the flicker noise origin , namely wether it is a bulk or surface effect .",
    "although this issue is far from being resolved , there is no doubt that the noise level increases with decreasing sample size . to be more specific",
    ", we note that if @xmath291 then eqs .  ( [ mainhom ] ) , ( [ gfactorapprox1 ] )",
    "tell us that the noise produced by an elongated sample is proportional to @xmath292 for experimental verification of this prediction we refer to @xcite which report the results of flicker noise measurements in various copper films with @xmath293@xmath294 , and @xmath295 according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the frequency exponent for samples on a silicon substrate exceeds noticeably that for equally sized samples on a sapphire substrate ( the ratio of @xmath265 s for the two cases is about @xmath296 ) .",
    "it follows then from the above formulas that the slope of the noise amplitude considered as a function of the film thickness is larger for samples on the silicon substrate .",
    "this is indeed the case as is clearly seen from fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . furthermore , since @xmath265 increases for decreasing @xmath297 the slope of the noise amplitude considered as a function of the sample length is expected to be larger for thicker samples , but with a less noticeable difference in the slopes since the length exponent @xmath298 is less sensitive to variations in @xmath265 than the thickness exponent @xmath299 ( @xmath265 is about some tenths in both cases ) .",
    "this is again in agreement with the observations as is evident from fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite where the amplitude curve for a @xmath300 - thick film is somewhat steeper than that for a @xmath301 - thick film ( both on a silicon substrate ) .",
    "next , it is generally agreed that , with other things being equal , flicker noise is more intensive in semiconductors than in metals , and this is again in conformity with eq .",
    "( [ mainhom ] ) , because charge carrier mobility is higher in semiconductors than in metals , usually by several orders .",
    "unfortunately , determination of mobility in semiconductors ( or semimetals ) is a difficult problem , both theoretically and experimentally , and different experiments often give significantly different results .",
    "by this reason , the subsequent consideration will be carried out for metals only . even in this case",
    "careful estimation of the noise level takes some effort .",
    "this is because electron mobilities in thin metal films commonly used in flicker noise measurements differ essentially from the corresponding bulk values , varying non - monotonically with the film thickness , and exhibiting complicated temperature dependence .",
    "thus , the thicker the film , the more reliable comparison of theoretical and experimental results .",
    "fortunately , the modern instrumentation allows measurements in sufficiently thick samples , electrical transport in which has bulk properties ( usually , effects related to film thickness become important for @xmath302 less than a few hundred nanometers ) .",
    "as is well known , temperature dependence of the electron mobility in this case is well approximated by the @xmath303 law . theoretically , this approximation is valid for @xmath17 higher than the debay characteristic temperature , but in most cases it is practically applicable already for @xmath304 furthermore , the effective dimensionality @xmath305 in thick samples .",
    "therefore , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ mainhom ] ) that in sufficiently thick samples the frequency exponent @xmath306 and the flicker noise level is temperature independent .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed , e.g. , by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath7 noise was measured in @xmath307 thick metal films , which is quite sufficient for bulk treatment of the sample conduction .",
    "according to fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the flicker noise level is constant for @xmath308 indeed , and @xmath1 is found to be about @xmath309 for most samples .",
    "the samples undergone structural defects resulting in somewhat higher values of @xmath310 unfortunately , the authors of @xcite did not specify the metals used in their experiments , which makes quantitative comparison with eq .",
    "( [ mainhom ] ) impossible . ] in the opposite case of extremely thin films , conductivity is approximately independent of temperature .",
    "for instance , resistivity of a @xmath311 thick gold film varies from the value @xmath312 at @xmath313 to @xmath314 at @xmath315 i.e. , only by about @xmath316 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 were constant , this would mean that the noise magnitude is a linear function of temperature in this case .",
    "however , @xmath265 is itself temperature dependent in thin films , namely , it is expected to decrease with increasing temperature , because thermal effects destroy the exchange correlations , thus raising the effective dimensionality of the sample .",
    "finally , it was found in @xcite that the frequency exponent in some cases depends also on the sample length , though much more weakly than on the sample thickness .",
    "this dependence can not be explained from the point of view of the developed theory , so its appearance can serve as an indication on the limits of applicability of the theory .      in order to compare the absolute value of the noise spectral density given by eq .",
    "( [ mainhom ] ) with experimental data , we refer to the results of flicker noise measurements performed by wong , cheng and ruan @xcite , which were used already in the above qualitative analysis , and by voss and clarke @xcite . before going into detailed comparison ,",

    "[ unbound ] , the obtained results explain the observed unboundedness of the flicker noise spectra , resolving naturally the problem of divergence of the total noise power . together with the demonstrated qualitative and quantitative agreement of the results with experimental data , this suggests that quantum electromagnetic fluctuations is the source of flicker noise in metal films .",

    "the only difference with the green function we considered in sec .",
    "[ calcul ] is that the external scalar lines in eq .",
    "( [ wardc1 ] ) are the particle propagators . to promote them into particle amplitudes , according to the standard rules , eq .",
    "( [ wardc1 ] ) is to be fourier transformed with respect to the variables @xmath407 and then multiplied by @xmath408 where the arguments @xmath409 of the fourier transformations with respect to @xmath410 are to be taken eventually on the mass shell .",
    "but these operations give zero identically when applied to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ wardc1 ] ) , because each of the factors @xmath411 @xmath412 makes the corresponding particle propagator nonsingular on the mass shell .",
    "for instance , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ wardc1 ] ) gives rise to the contribution of the form @xmath413 times terms nonsingular on the mass shell .",
    "for @xmath414 the function @xmath415 is also nonsingular at @xmath416 and hence this contribution vanishes on the mass shell .",
    "thus , the correlation function is invariant under gauge transformations of the external field , which are part of the gauge freedom in the theory .",
    "the other part is related to the explicit dependence of the photon propagator on the choice of the gauge conditions used to fix the gauge invariance of the action . as is well known , it is longitudinal part of the propagator that depends on the gauge .",
    "let us first consider the simples case of lorentz - invariant gauges .",
    "then the most general form of the longitudinal part is given by eq .",
    "( [ long ] ) in which @xmath18 is to be regarded as an arbitrary function of @xmath417 it is not difficult to see that variations of @xmath418 do not affect the observable quantities .",
    "recall , first of all , that we are interested ultimately in the fluctuations of gauge - invariant quantities such as the electric field strength .",
    "the @xmath18-independence of these quantities is a direct consequence of their gauge invariance , because variations of @xmath418 give rise to terms that are pure gradients with respect to the spacetime arguments @xmath419 as is easily verified by substituting the expression ( [ long ] ) in place of one or two photon propagators in eq .",
    "( [ diagen ] ) . then",
    ", if the vector potential contribution to the field strength is negligible , as is the case in our nonrelativistic calculation ( recall the condition @xmath420 used throughout ) , the voltage correlation function can be found by integrating the correlation function for the field strength with respect to @xmath96 using the relation @xmath421    more generally , the longitudinal part of the photon propagator in a lorentz non - invariant gauge has the form , in coordinate space , @xmath422 where @xmath423 is an arbitrary function of spacetime coordinates . if the lorentz index of the spacetime derivative in @xmath424 is left free after combining the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , then this term leads to a gradient contribution to the two - point function of electromagnetic field , and , as before , does not contribute to the voltage correlation function . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spacetime derivative is contracted with the interaction vertex , then the contribution of @xmath424 to the two - point function is not pure gradient , so the above argument does not work .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that all such terms cancel each other in the complete expression for the correlation function .",
    "however , this requires examination of the complete set of feynman diagrams , which complicates the proof . to avoid this complication",
    ", we will prove gauge independence of the low - frequency asymptotic of the power spectrum only , which is quite sufficient for our purposes . to this end , we use the following identity expressing invariance of the particle action under the transformation ( [ gaugetransform ] ) @xmath425 differentiating this identity twice with respect to @xmath426 @xmath427 and setting @xmath428 afterwards yields @xmath429 the left hand side here is just the interaction vertex contracted with the derivative coming from the term @xmath430 it follows that the result of this contraction is expressed through the inverse charged particle propagator . when built into the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the latter is integrated with either the function @xmath431 ( the external line ) , or the particle propagator . in the first case it gives zero by virtue of the definition of free particle states , while in the second it cancels the particle propagator .",
    "at the same time , as we saw in sec .",
    "[ calcul ] , it is singularity of the particle propagator that is responsible for the occurrence of @xmath432 contribution to the function @xmath433 hence , longitudinal part of the photon propagator does not contribute to the leading low - frequency term of the power spectrum of electromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "thus , gauge - independence of our results expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ main ] ) , ( [ mainhom ] ) is proved completely .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we keep track of the factor @xmath435 in the formulas of the present section . as was mentioned in sec .",
