    "taking a look at the last decade , a lot of attention has been drawn to brane - world models . these are mainly string inspired models",

    "all matter fields are trapped on the brane and only gravity can propagate to the bulk .",
    "if we have n dimensions perpendicular to the brane , then we have a codimension - n brane - world @xcite,@xcite .    of special interest , in the context of brane - worlds ,",
    "is the study of black holes residing on the brane , mainly in the set up of codimension-1 models .",
    "the issue was first addressed by chamblin et.al .",
    "a four - dimensional black hole on a 3-brane can be stretched to the extra dimension , forming something like a black cigar due to gregory - laflame instability @xcite , while at the same time solving the five - dimensional einstein equations .",
    "still instabilities can occur @xcite .",
    "furthermore one can look into the effective four - dimensional einstein equations on the brane @xcite , and try to solve them @xcite .",
    "also recently there has been an investigation of brane - world black holes in the context of heterotic brane - world scenario @xcite .",
    "investigating the case of a 2-brane in a four - dimensional universe there is a way out .",
    "based on the form for an accelerating four - dimensional black hole ( c - metric ) @xcite , emparan et.al .",
    "@xcite found a btz black hole @xcite residing on a 2-brane , which can be extended into the bulk , forming a btz black string .",
    "their thermodynamic analysis showed that there is an instability similar to the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite .    expanding the number of extra dimensions ,",
    "one can investigate higher codimension models .",
    "the first attempt of course is to examine codimension-2 brane - worlds .",
    "just like in three - dimensional gravity , where a point particle can induce a deficit angle , @xcite , @xcite , the same can happen if we imbed a 3-brane into a six - dimensional space time .",
    "the vacuum energy of the brane , instead of curving the brane - wolrd volume , induces a deficit angle in the bulk solution around the brane @xcite .",
    "this property was the driving force , in order to solve the cosmological problem as was done by many authors @xcite . still due to near",
    "brane singularities , the brane s energy - momentum has to be proportional to its induced metric , if one wants to find nonsingular solutions @xcite . in order to avoid this obstacle",
    "one has to introduce some thickness to the brane @xcite , or modify the gravitational action in the thin brane limit , introducing either a gauss - bonnet term  @xcite or an induced gravity term on the brane  @xcite , recovering in this way four - dimensional gravity on the brane .",
    "unlike the situation in codimension-1 brane - world models , there is no clear understanding of time - dependent cosmological solutions in codimension-2 set ups . in the thin brane limit",
    "the brane equation of state and energy density are tuned , due to a relation between the energy - momentum tensors on the brane and in the bulk , giving this way a non - standard cosmology on the brane  @xcite . in order to resolve this problem",
    "one has to regularize the codimension-2 branes by introducing some thickness and then consider matter on them @xcite . to have a cosmological evolution on the regularized branes the brane world - volume should be expanding and in general the bulk space",
    "should also evolve in time .",
    "alternatively  @xcite one has to consider a codimension-1 brane moving in the regularized static background .",
    "the resulting cosmology , however , is unrealistic having a negative newton s constant ( for a review on the cosmology in six dimensions see  @xcite ) .",
    "deficit angles can also appear in the context of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "for example , if a black hole is pierced by a cosmic string , a deficit angle appears in the space outside the string @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of that property , and adjusting it , a six - dimensional black hole localized on a 3-brane of codimension-2  @xcite was constructed , with a conical structure in the bulk and deformations accommodating the deficit angle . still due to near",
    "brane instabilities we mentioned earlier ,",
    "it is not easy to realize these solutions in the thin brane limit , where high curvature terms are needed to accommodate matter on the brane . finally application of rotation @xcite and perturbative analysis was performed  @xcite .    in  @xcite black holes on an infinitely thin conical 2-brane and their extension into a five - dimensional bulk with a gauss - bonnet term",
    "were studied .",
    "two classes of solutions were found .",
    "the first class consists of the familiar btz black hole which solves the junction conditions on a conical 2-brane in vacuum .",
    "these solutions in the bulk are btz string - like objects with regular horizons and no pathologies .",
    "the warping to five - dimensions depends on the length @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gauss - bonnet coupling , and this length scale defines the shape of the horizon .",
    "consistency of the bulk solutions requires a fine - tuned relation between the gauss - bonnet coupling and the five - dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "the second class of solutions consists of btz black holes with short distance corrections .",
    "these solutions correspond to a btz black hole conformally dressed with a scalar field  @xcite .",
    "localization of these black holes on the 2-brane leads to the interesting result that the energy - momentum tensor required to support such solutions on the brane corresponds to the energy - momentum tensor of a scalar field in the limit @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length scale of the three - dimensional ads space and @xmath4 the radial distance on the brane .",
    "also these solutions have black string - like extensions into the bulk .    in these notes we will present an extension of the work done in  @xcite .",
    "now insted of having a 2-brane in a five - dimensional space , we will have a 3-brane into a six - dimensional space - time  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that four - dimensional schwarzschild - ads black holes on the brane can have an extension into the bulk with a warp factor .",
    "these look like black string - like objects with regular horizons .",
    "the warping to the extra dimensions , again depends on the gauss - bonnet coupling which is again fine - tuned to the six - dimensional cosmological constant . keeping the deficit angle constant",
    ", the presence of a four dimensional black holes on the brane , requires matter in the two extra dimensions .    in the following",
    ", first we will present briefly the btz string - like solutions of the five - dimensional case . in section 3",
    "we discuss the black holes on a 3-brane in a six - dimensional space - time and in section 4 we discuss the special r@xmath5le played by the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "finally , in section 5 we conclude .",

    "capital @xmath13 ,  @xmath14 indices will take values in the five - dimensional space .",
    "the einstein equations resulting from the variation of the action  ( [ 5daction ] ) are g^(5)n_m + r_c^2 g^(3)_g_m^g^n_-h_m^n =  , [ einsequat3 ] where h_m^n&= &  .",

    "<S> in this talk we discuss black hole solutions in six - dimensional gravity with a gauss- bonnet term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on a thin 3-brane of codimension-2 . it is shown that these black holes can be localized on the 3-brane , and they can further be extended into the bulk by a warp function . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions have regular horizons and no other curvature singularities appear apart from the string - like ones . </S>",
    "<S> the projection of the gauss - bonnet term on the brane imposes a constraint relation which requires the presence of matter in the extra dimensions , in order to sustain our solutions . </S>"
