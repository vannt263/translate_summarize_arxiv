    "ultra - peripheral collisions occur when two ions pass by each other with an impact parameter ( @xmath2 ) large enough so that they do not interact hadronically , but small enough so that electromagnetic interactions occur @xcite .",
    "the photon flux comes from the electromagnetic fields of the colliding ions .",
    "both @xmath3 and photonuclear interactions are possible .",
    "@xmath3 interactions probe quantum electrodynamics in strong fields , while photonuclear interactions are sensitive to the structure of the target nucleus .",
    "the latter topic is a key focus of the initial state 2014 conference .",
    "there are several reasons to study upcs at heavy ion colliders .",
    "the photon flux scales as @xmath4 , so interaction rates can be very high , and it is possible to exchange more than one photon in a single ion - ion encounter . the maximum photon energy is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lorentz boost of the ion ( in the target frame ) . at rhic ,",
    "the maximum target - frame photon energy is about 600 gev .",
    "multi - photon interactions are an important experimental tool for studying upcs .",
    "photoproduction ( or @xmath3 interactions ) accompanied by mutual coulomb excitation is of particular interest .",
    "one photon produces a vector meson or other final state , while the two nuclei exchange two additional photons , each of which excites the other nucleus .",
    "when the two excited nuclei decay , they emit neutrons which provide a convenient experimental trigger @xcite .",
    "each photon is emitted independently , linked only by a common impact parameter @xcite , and the cross - sections can be computed by integrating over the impact parameter @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability for reaction 1 to occur at impact parameter @xmath2 and @xmath9 is the probability not to have a hadronic interaction , which would obscure the upc .",
    "away from the kinematic limits , @xmath10 . for coulomb excitation , these probabilities may be large , and so may require unitarization : @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the non - unitarized probability .",
    "besides allowing a simple trigger , multi - photon interactions occur at considerably smaller average impact parameters than single - photon exchange , leading to a considerably harder photon spectrum .",
    "also , as we will see below , the common @xmath13 introduces correlations between the final states .",
    "although the cross - sections for most @xmath3 interactions are lower than for photonuclear interactions @xcite , lepton pairs are copiously produced .",
    "the total cross - section for @xmath14 pairs with gold beams at rhic is 100,000 barns !",
    "most of these leptons have very low transverse momentum , @xmath15 , so they are not observed in a central detector .",
    "however , enough of them have enough @xmath16 so that they can be a significant background in vertex detectors .",
    "both star and phenix have studied production of @xmath14 pairs , although they only detect leptons with considerably higher @xmath16 .",
    "star studied pairs with lepton @xmath17 mev / c accompanied by mutual coulomb excitation @xcite .",
    "the star analysis found that the cross - section was compatible with the predictions of lowest order quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "a later study using a newer theoretical calculation found that the result was more compatible with an all - order calculation , incorporating coulomb corrections @xcite .",
    "phenix studied high - mass @xmath14 production as part of their analysis of @xmath18 photoproduction , and found results that were consistent with qed @xcite .",
    "another important @xmath3 interaction is bound - free pair production , which happens when an @xmath14 pair is produced with the electron bound to one of the ions .",
    "the resulting single - electron ions have a reduced charge to mass ratio , but an unchanged momentum , so their trajectories gradually diverge from the beam of bare ions @xcite . for gold ,",
    "the beam of single - electron ions spreads out before hitting the beampipe .",
    "however , for copper , the single - electron beam remains focused , striking the beampipe about 136 m downstream from the interaction region .",
    "the resulting showers have been observed using a series of pin diodes ( part of the rhic radiation monitoring system ) , at about the expected cross - section @xcite .",
    "this process is important at higher energy colliders , where the single - electron ion beam may carry enough energy to quench superconducting magnets .",
    "the most commonly studied photonuclear interaction is vector meson photoproduction .",
    "one nucleus emits a photon , which fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath19 ) , which then scatters elastically ( but hadronically ) emerging as a real vector meson ; the cross - section depends on the size of the @xmath19 dipole .",
    "this occurs via meson ( at low energies ) and pomeron ( in modern terms , a gluon ladder ) exchange . in perturbative qcd ,",
    "the cross - section depends on the gluon density @xmath20 of the target nucleus , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the quark mass @xcite .",
    "the bjorken-@xmath23 of the gluon is determined by the kinematics , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the proton mass , @xmath26 is the vector meson mass , and @xmath27 is its rapidity . here , @xmath28 is the lorentz boost of one nucleus , in the lab frame .",
    "the @xmath29 is because of the ambiguity as to which nucleus emitted the photon and which is the target .",
    "the cross - section for coherent @xmath30 interactions may be calculated using a glauber calculation @xcite , using the results of a @xmath31 calculation , or using data as input .",
    "the glauber calculation accounts for the possibility for a @xmath19 dipole to interact multiple times within the nucleus . for small dipoles ,",
    "the coherent cross - section ( with @xmath32 mev / c ) is enhanced as @xmath33 , while for larger dipoles , multiple interactions reduce the cross - sections . for the @xmath0 , the cross - section scales very roughly as @xmath34 .",
    "hera has accurate data on vector meson photoproduction in the energy range relevant to rhic @xcite .",
    "this data can be used to check calculations of @xmath31 or as direct input to a glauber calculation . by comparing rhic data with ion targets to the hera data",
    ", one can measure nuclear effects , such as shadowing , which reduce the cross - section compared with a model where each nucleon is independent @xcite .",
    "saturation models also predict significant nuclear dependence @xcite .",
    "star has studied vector meson photoproduction in gold - gold collisions at energies of 62 @xcite , 130 @xcite and 200 gev @xcite ; the 200 gev data is the most precise .",
    "the mid - rapidity @xmath35 is about half that predicted by a quantum glauber calculation @xcite , but is consistent with the predictions of a classical glauber calculation @xcite .",
    "recent alice data on @xmath35 for @xmath36 photoproduction in lead - lead collisions exhibits a similar factor of two suppression below the quantum glauber calculation , and is also consistent with a classical glauber approach @xcite .",
    "one likely explanation is that the @xmath36 production is reduced because of gluon shadowing or other nuclear effects .",
    "normally , one does not expect perturbative qcd phenomena such as shadowing to apply for vector mesons as light as the @xmath36 , but that possibility needs to be considered .    [ tb ]    the latest star study found about 650,000 @xmath0 events in 37 million triggers collected during the 2010 run @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 invariant mass plot , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhomass ] , was fit to a breit - wigner resonance ( for the @xmath36 ) , a constant contribution ( for direct @xmath37 production ) , an interference term , and a background term .",
    "the fit returns a mass and width consistent with the known values for the @xmath36 , and the ratio of @xmath0 to direct pions is similar to that observed in @xmath1 collisions at hera .",
    "star has also studied coherent photo - production of excited @xmath36 states @xcite , decaying to four charged pions .",
    "this should occur mostly through the @xmath38 and/or the @xmath39 .",
    "star observed a coherent enhancement at low @xmath16 , consistent with a mixture of the two resonances .",
    "the cross - section seems consistent with predictions based on generalized vector meson dominance @xcite .",
    "phenix has studied @xmath18 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "they find a cross - section consistent with the quantum glauber model .",
    "the @xmath16 spectrum exhibits a mixture of coherent and incoherent production .",
    "they have also observed photoproduction of @xmath40 in the forward region ( @xmath41 ) , with higher statistics , but , as of yet , no cross - section determination @xcite .",
    "star has also studied @xmath18 photoproduction , and sees a signal of about 100 events in the 2010 data @xcite .",
    "they have also not released a cross - section , but the ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath36 production is slightly higher than theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "[ tb ]    vector mesons may be produced via coherent or incoherent photoproduction .",
    "in coherent production , the nucleus remains intact , while with incoherent production , it breaks up .",
    "however , in upcs , the situation is complicated by the presence of additional photons , which can also cause the nucleus to break up .",
    "neutrons emitted by the nuclear breakup may provide a convenient signature to trigger a detector .",
    "the star collaboration finessed this problem by selecting events with a single neutron in each zero degree calorimeter , under the expectation that most incoherent production generates more than one neutron . the resulting @xmath36 @xmath42 spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhopt ] , along with a comparison with the sartre monte carlo @xcite . here ,",
    "the longitudinal component of @xmath43 is small , so @xmath44 .",
    "the spectrum is characteristic of diffraction , with at least two peaks visible , separated by a minima .",
    "sartre predicts the position of the peaks correctly , but this version overestimates their depth , likely because it did not account for the @xmath16 of the emitted photon .",
    "it is possible to fourier transform the @xmath16 spectrum to determine the nuclear density profile , modulated by the effect of the glauber superposition .",
    "the geometry of upc photonuclear collisions introduces interesting correlations between the particles produced in multi - photon interactions .",
    "the electric field vectors point away from the emitting nucleus . at the target nucleus , the electric field vectors of all of the photons",
    "are aligned with @xmath13 , so the photons share a common linear polarization .",
    "if the two photons are both emitted from the same nucleus , then the electric fields point in the same direction , while if they are emitted by different nuclei , then the fields point in opposite directions .",
    "the linear alignment has experimental consequences , even for single particle production . at mid - rapidity , each nucleus is equally likely to be a photon emitter or absorber .",
    "the electric fields for the two possibilities are anti - aligned , so the two production amplitudes can cancel out . at @xmath45 , production is suppressed . at finite @xmath16 ,",
    "the propagator @xmath46 comes into play and the cross - section scales as @xmath47 , so for @xmath48 , production is suppressed . for @xmath36 photoproduction accompanied by mutual coulomb excitation at rhic ,",
    "@xmath49 fm , and significant suppression has been observed for @xmath50 mev / c @xcite .",
    "the alignment also causes azimuthal angular correlations between different particles produced in the same ion - ion interaction .",
    "these correlations are visible in the azimuthal angular distributions of the decay products .",
    "the decay products of a linearly polarized spin-1 particle ( like a vector meson or giant dipole resonances ) form a @xmath51 azimuthal distribution with respect to the photon polarization .",
    "classically , the two linear polarizations follow @xmath13 , and the azimuthal angular distribution between the @xmath16 of the particles produced in the two decays is @xcite @xmath52 this neglects the @xmath16 of the spin-1 vector mesons or excited nuclei , a very small correction",
    ". these correlations should already be observable at rhic , in cases like mutual coulomb excitation to a giant dipole resonance , where both nuclei are excited and decay by single neutron emission ; the direction of the @xmath16 of the neutrons can be determined using segmented zero degree calorimeters .    when two identical vector mesons ( _ e . g. _",
    "@xmath53 ) are produced , there will also be bosonic enhancements . since each ion can be produced at either nuclear target , there are four diagrams to produce two @xmath0 mesons in a single ion - ion encounter @xcite . in the simplest case ,",
    "production at large rapidities , the dominant diagram for double - meson production has both mesons coming from the same nucleus .",
    "then , the double-@xmath36 production amplitude @xmath54 is @xmath55 the probability to produce two identical vector mesons with a small @xmath56 is enhanced .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath53 pair production @xcite is large enough that this enhancement should be observable with existing rhic data .",
    "a more detailed calculation of @xmath53 photoproduction is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one notable goal for future rhic upc studies is to measure the gpd - e helicity - flip parton distribution , which is related to the angular momentum carried by the quarks in a nucleus @xcite .",
    "the experimental channels is @xmath18 photoproduction on polarized proton targets .",
    "this is most feasible using @xmath57 interactions where the ion emits the photon @xcite .",
    "this is one of the few ways to measure the gpd - e parton distribution .",
    "it may also be possible to use other final states to study other photoproduction spin effects .",
    "[ tb ]    star has recently installed two sets of roman pots to detect protons that are slightly scattered from the beam .",
    "the initial purpose was to study @xmath58 elastic scattering , but they are also used to study @xmath58 central diffraction events , whereby the @xmath58 collision produces a central state in the detector , with rapidity gaps between that central state and the protons on both sides @xcite . in previous",
    "running , the roman pot locations were optimized to study elastic scattering , but a small sample of exclusive events was observed ; they were selected by requiring that the @xmath16 of the event be balanced within 20 mev / c , including the proton @xmath16 measured in the roman pots ; this led to a clean selection of exclusive events , with almost no background ( as determined from like - sign events ) .",
    "figure [ fig : romanpots ] shows the @xmath16 distribution of the events ; the large peak for @xmath59 mev / c is from fully reconstructed interactions .",
    "the right panel shows the invariant mass distribution , compared with two simulations based on double - pomeron interactions . there is a hint of @xmath60 production , as expected in double - pomeron interactions .",
    "no @xmath36 peak is visible , showing that photon - pomeron interactions do not play a major role .",
    "however , other photoproduction reactions may still be of interest ; @xmath18 photoproduction has been observed in @xmath58 collisons at the lhc , and in and @xmath61 collisions at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the major physics goal of an @xmath62 program at an electron ion collider is to study the internal structure of heavy nuclei , including by studying how the quarks and gluons in nucleons are altered when the nucleons are placed into a heavy nucleus @xcite . in @xmath62 collisions ,",
    "the electron emits a virtual photon , which flutuates to a @xmath19 pair which then interacts with the nucleus ; vector meson photoproduction is one of the main reactions being studied @xcite . as with upcs ,",
    "@xmath62 interactions are sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution .",
    "the main advantage of @xmath62 collisions is that one can detect the scattered electron and determine the @xmath63 of the photon , independent of the hadronic final state .",
    "it is possible to study the gluon distributions at a variety of @xmath63 , in contrast to upcs , where the @xmath63 is fixed by the mass of the final state quarks .",
    "ultra - peripheral collisions have been used to explore a number of key physics topics at rhic .",
    "@xmath14 production has been used to study higher order qed and to measure bound - free pair production .",
    "vector meson photoproduction has been used to study nuclear structure and , particularly shadowing .",
    "rhic and lhc data on @xmath36 photoproduction show evidence for significant nuclear suppression .",
    "future data should probe nuclear shadowing in @xmath36 and @xmath18 in consideably greater detail . in the longer term",
