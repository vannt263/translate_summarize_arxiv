    "the puzzling questions posed by the observations of climate changes @xcite have recently provided further motivations to the investigation of extreme events and dynamics @xcite . in particular , the statistics of the return times ( rts ) of extreme values is one of the subjects that have recently attracted the attentions of many authors @xcite .",
    "return times ( or intervals ) @xmath0 , of the extreme values of a fluctuating quantity @xmath1 , associated with the overcoming of a given threshold @xmath2 , can be defined @xcite as the time intervals between two consecutive occurrences of the condition @xmath3 . in the case of uncorrelated events",
    "it is easy to show that the rts are exponentially distributed @xcite .",
    "exponential distributions describe the statistics of return intervals of prices in financial markets , wind speed data or daily precipitations in a given place for the same time windows @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in recent years it has been realized that several other important examples of time series display long - term correlations @xcite .",
    "this is the case of physiological data ( heartbeats @xcite and neuron spikes @xcite ) , hydro - meteorological records ( daily temperatures @xcite ) , geophysical or astrophysical data ( occurrence of earthquakes @xcite or solar flares @xcite ) , internet traffic @xcite and stock market volatility @xcite records . long - term correlated time series are characterized by an auto - correlation function , @xmath4 , decaying as a power - law : @xmath5 where the correlation exponent @xmath6 ranges between 0 and 1 ( normalized series @xmath7 with zero average and unit variance are considered ) .",
    "therefore , in these conditions , the mean correlation time @xmath8 diverges ( @xmath8 is defined as the integral over @xmath9 of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the effect of long - terms correlations on the rt statistics has been recently studied by bunde et al .",
    "@xcite and by altmann and kantz @xcite .",
    "both these studies were performed on the ground of numerical calculations on gaussian and long - term correlated time series generated by the fourier transform technique and by imposing a power - law decay of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of bunde at al . were the following .",
    "i ) the mean return interval @xmath11 is unchanged by the presence of long - terms correlations .",
    "ii ) the distribution of the rts becomes stretched exponential : @xmath12   \\label{stretch}\\ ] ] where the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath6 were found to be equal .",
    "iii ) the rts themselves are long - term correlated with a correlation exponent @xmath14 . actually ,",
    "as noted by altmann and kantz @xcite , the statement i ) is true in general and can be identified with kac s lemma @xcite introduced in the context of dynamical systems while the statement iii ) is true only in very special conditions @xcite .",
    "moreover , it must be noted that the results ii ) and iii ) only apply to linear time series ( i.e. to series whose properties are completely defined by the power spectrum and by the probability density ) @xcite .",
    "however , apart from this restriction , the stretched exponential distribution of the rts can be considered a general feature in presence of long - term correlations in a time series @xcite .",
    "this feature has important consequences on the observation of extreme events : indeed it implies a strong enhancement of the probability of having return intervals well below and well above @xmath11 , in comparison with the occurrence of extreme events in an uncorrelated time series .",
    "furthermore , it must be noted @xcite that the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ stretch ] ) only depends on the parameter @xmath13 , being @xmath15 and @xmath16 function of @xmath13 .    here",
    "it will be considered the effect on the distribution of the rts of the presence of finite - term correlations with non - exponential decay , a situation which can occur in systems which are approaching criticality , where intermediate behaviors with non - exponential and non - power - law decay of correlations can emerge @xcite .",
    "thus , in the next section it will be analyzed the rt statistics of extreme values of the resistance ad defect - fraction fluctuations displayed by a resistor with granular structure in a nonequilibrium stationary state @xcite .",
    "the time series analyzed consist in the fluctuations of resistance and defect - fraction of a thin resistor with granular structure , biased by an external current @xmath17 and in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the resistance values are calculated by using the multi - species resistor network ( msn ) model @xcite .",
    "the msn model describes a conducting film with granular structure as a resistor network made by different species of elementary resistors .",
    "precisely , the resistor species are distinguished by their resistances and by their energies associated with thermally activated stochastic processes of breaking and recovery of the elementary resistors .",
    "the broken elementary resistors , named defects , correspond to resistors of resistance about @xmath19 higher than that of normal resistors . as a result of the competition between pairs of breaking and recovery processes for each species ,",
    "the network can reach a stationary state whose properties will be dependent on the external conditions .",
    "the resistance and the defect fraction of the network are calculated by monte carlo simulations as a function of the time for different temperatures @xcite .",
    "all the details about the msn model and its results can be found in ref . .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this model provides a correlation time of the resistance fluctuations dependent on the temperature : @xmath20 with @xmath21 , thus diverging for @xmath22 . as a result ,",
    "the power spectral density of the resistance fluctuations shows a @xmath23 dependence of frequency , with @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "it should be also noted that the msn model represents an extension to systems characterized by @xmath26 noise of a previous model existing in the literature , the stationary and biased resistor network ( sbrn ) model @xcite . in any case",
    ", it must be underlined that , apart from the specific system described by the msn model , the method used here for generating the time series can be also viewed as a pure numerical algorithm for generating numerical series with different and tunable correlation properties .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     now , let us consider the rt distribution of extreme values for time series with finite correlation time and slow , non - exponential decay of correlations : a situation that can be called of `` intermediate - term correlations '' . as shown by figs . 2 and 3 ,",
    "the auto - correlation functions of the resistance fluctuations at @xmath27 and @xmath28 k ( i.e. at @xmath29 ) and of the defect - fraction fluctuations at @xmath30 k are well described by eq .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) .",
    "thus , these series just exhibit this intermediate behavior of the time correlations .",
    "figures 6 and 7 display double - logarithmic plots of the normalized probability density of the @xmath0 values calculated for the fluctuations at @xmath27 k respectively of the resistance and of the defect - fraction .",
    "different thresholds @xmath2 ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 are considered in both cases .",
    "the slope of the solid line is 0.26 and 0.23 , respectively for the case of figs .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show that the distribution of the return intervals of extreme values of these series is well described by a stretched exponential and that the value of the exponent @xmath13 is independent of the threshold @xmath2 in a large range of @xmath2-values .",
    "this occurs even in absence of long - term correlations and in presence of a finite correlation time .",
    "the distribution of return intervals of extreme values has been studied in several time series with different correlation properties : long - term and finite - term correlations .",
    "precisely , it has been analyzed the return interval distribution of the fluctuations of resistance and defect - fraction displayed by a resistor with granular structure in nonequilibrium stationary states at different temperatures t. the resistance fluctuations were calculated by using the msn model which is based on a resistor network approach @xcite .",
    "it has been found that when the auto - correlation function displays a non - exponential and a non - power - law decay , the distribution of the return intervals is well described by a stretched exponential with exponent @xmath13 largely independent of the threshold @xmath2 .",
    "this result shows that the stretched exponential distribution describes the distribution of the return intervals of extreme values not only when long - term correlations are present in the time series @xcite , but even when finite - term correlations with non - exponential decay exist among the records , a situation typical of many systems which are approaching criticality .",
