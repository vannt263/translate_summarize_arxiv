    "<S> a search for high - energy neutrinos interacting within the icecube detector between 2010 and 2012 provided the first evidence for a high - energy neutrino flux of extraterrestrial origin . </S>",
    "<S> results from an analysis using the same methods with a third year ( 2012 - 2013 ) of data from the complete icecube detector are consistent with the previously reported astrophysical flux in the 100 tev - pev range at the level of @xmath0 per flavor and reject a purely atmospheric explanation for the combined 3-year data at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with expectations for equal fluxes of all three neutrino flavors and with isotropic arrival directions , suggesting either numerous or spatially extended sources . </S>",
    "<S> the three - year data set , with a livetime of 988 days , contains a total of 37 neutrino candidate events with deposited energies ranging from 30 to 2000 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the 2000 tev event is the highest - energy neutrino interaction ever observed .                </S>",
    "<S> high energy neutrinos are expected to be produced in astrophysical objects by the decays of charged pions made in cosmic ray interactions with radiation or gas @xcite . as these pions decay </S>",
    "<S> , they produce neutrinos with typical energies of 5% those of the cosmic ray nucleons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these neutrinos can travel long distances undisturbed by either the absorption experienced by high - energy photons or the magnetic deflection experienced by charged particles , making them a unique tracer of cosmic ray acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> observations since 2008 using the antarctic gigaton icecube detector @xcite while it was under construction provided several indications of such neutrinos in a variety of channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two years of data from the full detector , from may 2010 - may 2012 , then provided the first strong evidence for the detection of these astrophysical neutrinos @xcite using an all - flavor all - direction sample of neutrinos interacting within the detector volume . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis focused on neutrinos above 100 tev , at which the expected atmospheric neutrino background falls to the level of one event per year , allowing any harder astrophysical flux to be seen clearly . here , following the same techniques , we add a third year of data supporting this result and begin to probe the properties of the observed astrophysical neutrino flux .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrinos are detected in icecube by observing the cherenkov light produced in ice by charged particles created when neutrinos interact . </S>",
    "<S> these particles generally travel distances too small to be resolved individually and the particle shower is observed only in aggregate . in @xmath2 charged - current ( cc ) interactions , however , as well as a minority of @xmath3 cc , a high - energy muon is produced that leaves a visible track ( unless produced on the detector boundary heading outward ) . </S>",
    "<S> although deposited energy resolution is similar for all events , angular resolution for events containing visible muon tracks is much better ( @xmath4 , 50% cl ) than for those that do not ( @xmath5 , 50% cl ) @xcite . for equal neutrino fluxes of all flavors ( 1:1:1 ) , </S>",

    "<S> neutrinos produced in the same interactions @xcite enter icecube from above and below , and are seen at a much lower rate due to the low neutrino interaction cross - section . because @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons decay overwhelmingly to muons rather than electrons , these neutrinos are predominantly @xmath2 and usually have track - type topologies in the detector @xcite . as the parent meson s energy rises , its lifetime increases , making it increasingly likely to interact before decaying . </S>",
    "<S> both the atmospheric muon and neutrino fluxes thus become suppressed at high energy , with a spectrum one power steeper than the primary cosmic rays that produced them @xcite . at energies above @xmath8 tev , an analogous flux of muons and neutrinos from the decay of charmed mesons </S>",
    "<S> is expected to dominate , as the shorter lifetime of these particles allows this flux to avoid suppression from interaction before decay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this flux has not yet been observed , however , and both its overall rate and cross - over energy with the @xmath9 flux are at present poorly constrained @xcite . as before @xcite , we estimate all atmospheric neutrino background rates using measurements of the northern - hemisphere @xmath2 spectrum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> event selection identifies neutrino interactions in icecube by rejecting those events with cherenkov - radiating particles , principally cosmic ray muons , entering from outside the detector . as before </S>",
    "<S> , we used a simple anticoincidence muon veto in the outer layers of the detector @xcite , requiring that fewer than 3 of the first 250 detected photoelectrons ( pe ) be on the detector boundary . to ensure sufficient numbers of photons to reliably trigger this veto , we additionally required at least 6000 pe overall , corresponding to deposited energies of approximately 30 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this rejects all but one part in @xmath10 of the cosmic ray muon background above 6000 pe while providing a direction and topology - neutral neutrino sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use a data - driven method to estimate this background by using one region of icecube to tag muons and then measuring their detection rate in a separate layer of pmts equivalent to our veto ; this predicts a total muon background in three years of @xmath11 events . </S>",
    "<S> rejection of events containing entering muons also significantly reduces downgoing atmospheric neutrinos ( the southern hemisphere ) by detecting and vetoing muons produced in the neutrinos parent air showers @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this event , like event 28 , had sub - threshold early hits in the icetop surface array and our veto region , and is likely part of the expected muon background . </S>",
    "<S> three additional downgoing track events are ambiguous ; the remainder are uniformly distributed through the detector and appear to be neutrino interactions .    a purely atmospheric explanation for these events is strongly disfavored by their properties . </S>",

    "<S> while a harder spectrum is expected from atmospheric neutrinos produced in charmed meson decay , this possibility is constrained by the observed angular distribution . </S>",
    "<S> although such neutrinos are produced isotropically , approximately half @xcite of those in the southern hemisphere are produced with muons of high enough energy to reach icecube and trigger our muon veto . </S>",

    "<S> comparatively bright sources can not be ruled out , however , especially in the southern hemisphere , where the sensitivity of icecube to point sources in uncontained @xmath2 is reduced by the large muon background and small target mass above the detector .    the neutrino spectrum ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , neutrinos would be produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with either radiation or gas . </S>",
    "<S> interactions with radiation ( @xmath34 ) typically produce a peaked spectrum , reflecting the energy spectrum of the photons ; those with gas ( @xmath35 ) produce a smooth power law @xcite . while @xmath34 models satisfactorily explain some aspects of the data such as the possible drop - off at high energies , many involve a central plateau smaller than our observed energy range , placing them in weak tension with the data . as an example , the @xmath34 agn spectrum in @xcite peaks at several pev with much lower predictions at 100 tev ; thus , while able to explain the highest energy events , it fits poorly at lower energies and is disfavored as the sole source at the @xmath36 level with respect to our simple @xmath15 test flux </S>",
    "<S> . gamma - ray burst @xmath34 models such as @xcite have energy ranges better aligned with our data , with central plateaus from around 100 tev to a few pev , although existing limits from searches for correlations with observed grbs are more than an order of magnitude below the observed flux @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cosmic ray interactions with gas , such as predicted around supernova remnants in our and other galaxies , particularly those with high star - forming rates , produce smooth spectra with slopes reflecting post - diffusion cosmic rays ( e.g. @xmath37 in @xcite ) and seem to describe the data well . </S>",
    "<S> large uncertainties on both the measured neutrino spectrum and all models prevent any conclusions , however .    </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit flux level in our central energy range ( @xmath0 per flavor ) is similar to the waxman - bahcall bound @xcite , the aggregate neutrino flux from charged pion decay in all extragalactic cosmic ray accelerators if they are optically thin . </S>",
    "<S> this bound is derived from the cosmic ray spectrum above @xmath38 ev ( 1000 pev ) . </S>",
    "<S> our neutrinos , however , are likely associated with protons at much lower energies , on the order of 1 to 10 pev @xcite , at which the bound may be quite different @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> along with large uncertainties in the neutrino spectrum ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] ) , this makes correspondence with the waxman - bahcall bound , or @xmath38 ev cosmic ray sources , unclear .    </S>",
    "<S> further observations with the present or upgraded icecube detector and the planned km3net @xcite telescope are required to answer many questions about the sources of this astrophysical flux @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> gamma - ray , optical , and x - ray observations of the directions of individual high - energy neutrinos , which point directly to their origins , may also be able to identify these sources even for those with neutrino luminosities too low for identification from neutrino measurements alone .    </S>",
