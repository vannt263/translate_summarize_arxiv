    "a central question that is been debated in the _ fermi _ era regards the location of the blazar @xmath0-ray emission site : is the @xmath0 - ray emission of powerful blazars produced inside the sub - pc size broad line region ( blr ) or further out at scales of @xmath1 - few pc ( fig .",
    "1 ) where the ir photon field of the dusty molecular torus ( mt ) dominates over that of the uv field of the blr ? in the first case the @xmath0 - ray emission is most probably external compton ( ec ) scattering of the @xmath2 10 ev blr photons @xcite , while in the second the seed photons for the ec emission are the @xmath3 ev photons emitted by the dust @xcite in the mt @xcite .",
    "the issue of the energy dissipation location is connected to the jet formation and collimation process @xcite and , as we propose , can be approached through a sed diagnostic we introduce .",
    "- few pc , comparable to the size of the molecular torus ?",
    "this is an ongoing debate with strong cases presented by both camps .",
    "here we introduce a diagnostic based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and we show how it can be used to locate the blazar emission site.,width=355 ]      _ fermi _ has detected flares with decay time down to @xmath4 hours , comparable to the telescope sky scanning period .",
    "such variations have been seen in 3c 454.3 @xcite , pks 1454 - 354 @xcite , 3c 273 @xcite , pks 1502 + 106 @xcite , pks b1222 + 216 @xcite .",
    "the short variability timescale has been used to argue that the emission is produced within the blr ( e.g. @xcite ) : for a jet with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the bulk lorentz factor of the flow and @xmath7 the corresponding doppler factor , variability times of @xmath8 s ( @xmath2 3 hours ) , correspond to a maximum source size of @xmath9 cm . assuming a jet half - angle @xmath10 @xcite , an upper limit on the distance of the blazar from the central engine is @xmath11 cm .",
    "this distance is comparable to the blr size @xmath12 cm@xcite and , therefore , it is plausible that the gev emission is produced inside the blr .",
    "essentially this argument is based on the assumption that the entire cross section of the jet is emitting .",
    "if however one allows smaller parts of the jet to produce the @xmath0-ray emission ( e.g. @xcite ) such short variations can take place further out .",
    "the sub - pc scale energy dissipation is challenged by observations that put the emission at few pc distance from the black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) . in several cases ,",
    "optical polarimetry during an optical - @xmath0-ray flare showed a polarization behavior similar to that observed in simultaneous high frequency vlbi coming from the 43 ghz core , several pc away from the central engine .",
    "because of the similar optical and vlbi polarization behavior , the optical emission is constrained to emerge from the vlbi core and because the optical and @xmath0-ray variations are seen to be simultaneous , the @xmath0-ray emission is also constrained to emerge from the vlbi core at a distance of few to several pc from the black hole .",
    "additional arguments placing some of the @xmath0-ray flares at @xmath13 pc have been advanced for 3c 454.3 @xcite .",
    "these arguments are based on the similar behavior of optical and millimeter light curves and explain the gev emission as ec scattering of photons emitted from the dust of the mt .",
    "although at distances of @xmath13 pc from the central engine variability events are expected to be of the order of @xmath14 days , significantly shorter variations ( day long or even down to a few hours ) are seen ( e.g. pks 1510 - 089 @xcite ) .",
    "these can be explained if the observed variations come from a fraction of the jet cross section .",
    "recently , a diagnostic has been proposed @xcite for the location of the blazar gev emission that is based on the energy dependence of fermi flux variations .",
    "this diagnostic makes use of the fact that if the blazar emission takes place inside the brl the cooling is done on the @xmath15 ev blr photons , while if it takes place outside the blr , the most abundant seed photons are ir photons ( @xmath3 ev of the mt . in the first case cooling takes place at the onset of the klein - nishina cross section and gev variability is achromatic , while in the second case cooling takes place in the thomson regime and variability is faster at higher energies .",
    "although this is a powerful diagnostic , it can only be applied to a small number of bright _ fermi _ flares .",
    "in powerful blazars , the emission consists of two spectral components .",
    "the low frequency one peaks at @xmath16 hz @xcite and is attributed to synchrotron radiation ; the high frequency one peaks at @xmath17 hz @xcite and is usually attributed to inverse compton emission from external photons that are produced in the broad line region or in the mt .",
    "if @xmath6 is the bulk lorentz factor and @xmath7 the usual doppler factor of the jet flow , and @xmath18 is the lorentz factor of the electrons responsible for the synchrotron and ec sed peaks , then , @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the synchrotron peak energy , @xmath22 is the ec peak energy , @xmath23 is the characteristic energy of the external photon field , all in units of the electron rest mass , @xmath24 is the magnetic field permeating the emission region and @xmath25 g is the critical magnetic field .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : ec ] ) is valid only if the scattering of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath18 takes place in the thomson regime .",
    "the condition for this , @xmath26 can be written with the help of equation ( [ eq : ec ] ) as @xmath27 .",
    "the highest possible energy external seed photons are uv line photons with @xmath28 , which means that the scattering is indeed in the thomson regime as long as @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to an energy of @xmath30 gev or @xmath31 hz .",
    "given that in most cases powerful blazars peak at lower @xmath32 , with @xmath33 hz @xcite , the scattering of the electrons producing the ec peak is well within the thomson regime .",
    "taking the ratio of the two peak energies we obtain : @xmath34 the same ratio @xmath35 can be obtained from the expression for the compton dominance @xmath36 , the ratio @xmath37 of ec to synchrotron luminosity : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the external photon field energy density in the galaxy frame , @xmath40 is the external photon field energy density in the jet comoving frame and @xmath41 is the magnetic field energy density @xcite . solving equation ( [ eq : k ] ) for @xmath35 and equating to equation ( [ eq : eratio ] ) , we obtain our final expression @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the compton dominance in units of 10 , @xmath44 is @xmath32 in units of @xmath45 hz , and @xmath46 is @xmath47 in units of @xmath48 hz . _ note that the rhs contains only observables .",
    "it is the rhs that informs us about the ratio of the square root of the energy density over the peak energy of the seed photons ( seed factor , sf , in gauss ) available at the location of the @xmath0-ray emission.it is this information that we can use for understanding where the emission comes from . _",
    "reverberation mapping finds that @xmath49 cm where @xmath50 is the accretion disk luminosity @xmath51 in units of @xmath52 erg s@xmath53 , and that a fraction @xmath54 of @xmath51 is reprocessed by the blr @xcite .",
    "the energy density for the blr is then @xmath55 erg @xmath56 @xcite . because @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the same for sources of different luminosities .",
    "the blr sed in the galaxy frame can be approximated by a blackbody peaking at @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xcite ) . using these we obtain @xmath61 g.    because of the larger distance of the mt from the central engine , reverberation mapping has only been performed for seyferts ( e.g. @xcite ) , lower luminosity and therefore smaller mt size sources .",
    "these studies , along with ir interferometric studies ( e.g. @xcite ) are also in agreement with an @xmath57 scaling , suggesting that @xmath39 is the same for sources of different luminosities . adopting the results of @xcite for the blazar 4c 21.35 , a blackbody of temperature @xmath62 k ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 erg s@xmath53 emitted from a radius of @xmath65 pc , we obtain @xmath66 . with these",
    "we obtain @xmath67 g. a comparison of these indicative ranges is shown in figures 2 and 3 .     as a function of the sf for a number of sources , color - coded for redshift , for which @xmath47 , @xmath32 and @xmath36 are found from their seds .",
    "the solid line is the average from @xcite , the areas marked by dotted lines correspond to the @xmath0-ray emission site being inside the blr ( left ) or the mt ( right).,width=297 ]      in the previous discussion we considered only external photons . here",
    "we briefly discuss under what conditions synchrotron photons would be the dominant seed photons . a lower limit for he synchrotron photon density @xmath68 in the comoving frame ( assuming @xmath69 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the observed variability timescale and @xmath72 the luminosity of the synchrotron component . for this to dominate over @xmath73 , the comoving external photon field energy density , we require @xmath74 for our adopted blr range , @xmath75 erg @xmath56 , this is equivalent to @xmath76 similarly for our adopted mt range , @xmath77 this is equivalent to @xmath78 .",
    "vlbi studies of superluminal speeds in fsrqs ( e.g. see figure 24 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that for most fsrqs , @xmath79 , with values reaching up to @xmath80 .",
    "this raises the possibility that our diagnostic is relevant for sources that have relatively high @xmath6 , and that for the slower sources ssc may dominate .",
    "some preliminary results using the sample of @xcite with detections in the 2fgl or bat are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the average values of @xmath81few , @xmath82 hz , and @xmath83 found for powerful blazars @xcite correspond to a sf ( solid line ) that is closer to the mt range than that of the blr .",
    "the fact that the two bands corresponding to the sf we estimated for the blr and the mt occupy the central part of the observed sf range is encouraging and indicates that fsrqs experience a seed photon environment that is within the range of what is expected from our simple blr and mt considerations .",
    "we note that estimating @xmath47 and @xmath32 requires good multi - wavelength coverage , and errors of a factor up to @xmath13 are possible , particularly in the current estimates of @xmath32 .",
    "this suggests that the actual range of sf is significantly more narrow than the current data suggest , likely giving closer agreement with the range denoted by the bands in figures 2 and 3 once we have completed our sed analysis on very well sampled sources .    in future work",
    ", we plan to use all available data , including archival data from sources like ned with newer catalogues from wise , planck , swift , bat , lat to produce seds with simultaneous or contemporaneous data for as many sources as possible and derive their @xmath47 , @xmath32 and @xmath36 following @xcite , along with error estimates for these quantities .",
    "we anticipate that this work will significantly expand the sample in @xcite which was restricted to coverage of the synchrotron component only .",
    "to estimate the actual range of the sf in the blr and the mt , we need to know how the quantity @xmath84 is expected to vary radially .",
    "this requires information on the blr and the mt stratification , something that is not yet well constrained @xcite ) yet . for the modeling component of the project",
    ", we plan to explore how the sf range widens if one considers the stratification of different line photons in the blr ( e.g. @xcite and the fact that powerful ir components with @xmath85 down to @xmath86 k have been detected in radio - loud agn @xcite ."
