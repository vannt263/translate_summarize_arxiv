    "flares are explosions on the stellar surface , and are thought to occur by intense release of magnetic energy stored near starspots ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "+   + @xcite found 9 candidates of superflares on slowly rotating stars like the sun .",
    "superflares are the flares whose total energy is @xmath9 times larger ( @xmath10 erg ) than that of the most energetic flare on the sun ( @xmath11 erg ) .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered 365 superflare events on 148 solar - type stars that have effective temperature of 5100k @xmath12 @xmath13 6000k , and surface gravity of @xmath14 @xmath15 4.0 by analyzing the data of the kepler spacecraft ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite discovered 1547 superflares on 279 solar - type stars .",
    "the kepler spacecraft is particularly suitable for the detection of flares of small intensity , against the integrated star disk brightness , because of the combination of high photometric accuracy ( @xmath16 mag ) and continuous time - series data of a lot of stars over a long period ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+   + @xcite and @xcite suggested that superflares releasing a total energy in the range @xmath17 erg can occur once in @xmath18 years on sun - like stars that have effective temperature of 5600k @xmath12 @xmath13 6000k , surface gravity of @xmath14 @xmath15 4.0 , and the rotational period of @xmath19 @xmath15 10 days .",
    "many of solar - type stars having superflares show quasi - periodic brightness variations with a typical period from one day to a few tens of days .",
    "the amplitude of the brightness variations is in the range 0.1@xmath710@xmath20 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such brightness variations can be explained by the rotation of the star having starspots ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+   + @xcite found that the brightness variations of superflare - generating stars can be well explained by the rotation of the star with fairly large starspots , taking into account the effects of inclination angle and spot latitude .",
    "they also confirmed the correlation between the starspot coverage and the maximum energy of superflares .",
    "these results indicate that the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy stored around the starspots .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested from theoretical estimates that the sun can generate large magnetic flux which is enough for causing superflares with energy of @xmath21 erg within one solar cycle period ( @xmath7 11 years ) .",
    "+   + if such large starspots exist on a star , the activity level of its chromosphere becomes high and large plages occur near the starspots ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the lines of ca ii infrared triplet ( ca ii irt , @xmath22 = 8498 , 8542 , 8662 ) indicate the chromospheric activity of g - type stars .",
    "this is because these are collision - dominated lines and their cores are formed in the chromosphere , reflecting the temperature rise in their profiles which go from filled - in to pure emission , depending on the activity level .",
    "the fluxes in these lines are known to correlate well with the ca ii h+k emission index ( log@xmath23 ) and emission flux , which has been used as the indicator of chromospheric activity more traditionally ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "solar imaging spectroscopy in these lines is also conducted to investigate chromospheric structures , such as plages and fibrils ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+   + in addition , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggested that the h@xmath3 line also indicates the chromospheric activity of the sun and g - type stars .",
    "this is because the optical depth in the line core is large , and because the line formation becomes more and more dominated by collisions in very active stars or in plage regions .",
    "therefore , it is very important to conduct high - resolution spectroscopic observations to investigate the chromospheric activity of stars generating superflares , which is related to their photospheric starspots .",
    "+   + in this research , we analyze the high - resolution spectrum of a g - type superflare star ( kic6934317 ) , and investigate the chromospheric activity and the presence of starspots .",
    "we also estimate stellar parameters of the star , such as @xmath24 , @xmath14 , metallicity represented by the fe abundance relative to the sun ( [ fe / h ] ) , projected rotational velocity ( @xmath25 ) and the radial velocity ( rv ) , and discuss some features of this star .",

    "thus , one hypothesis that explains the large rotational velocity and high level of activity would be that this star is a binary which has maintained a high rotation rate thanks to the tidal interaction that has coupled spin and orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "+   + first , we checked the slit viewer images of subaru / hds for this star taken simultaneously with the spectra , and we can not find companions for this star as far as we looked this images .",

    "<S> we conducted the high - resolution spectroscopic observation with subaru / hds for a g - type star ( kic6934317 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we selected this star from the data of the kepler spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> this star produces a lot of superflares , and the total energy of the largest superflare on this star is @xmath0 times larger ( @xmath1 erg ) than that of the most energetic flare on the sun ( @xmath2 erg ) . the core depth and emission flux of ca ii infrared triplet lines and h@xmath3 line show high chromospheric activity in this star , in spite of its low lithium abundance and the small amplitude of the rotational modulation . using the empirical relations between emission flux of chromospheric lines and x - ray flux , this star is considered to show much higher coronal activity than that of the sun . </S>",
    "<S> it probably has large starspots which can store a large amount of magnetic energy enough to give rise to superflares . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimated the stellar parameters , such as effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , projected rotational velocity ( @xmath4 ) , and radial velocity . </S>",
    "<S> kic6934317 is then confirmed to be an early g - type main sequence star . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath4 is estimated to be @xmath5 km @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the rotational velocity is calculated to be @xmath720 km @xmath6 by using the period of the brightness variation as the rotation period . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be explained by its small inclination angle ( nearly pole - on ) . </S>",
    "<S> the small inclination angle is also supported by the contrast between the large superflare amplitude and the small stellar brightness variation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the lithium abundance and isochrones implies that the age of this star is more than about a few gyr , though a problem why this star with such an age has a strong activity remains unsolved . </S>"
