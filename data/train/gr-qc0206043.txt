    "many modern theories of the universe assume the existence of various types of scalar fields .",
    "such fields could explain the recently discovered acceleration of the expansion of the universe ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or the formation of clustered systems leading to gravitational walls for galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "if such fields really exist , the universe could contain many compact star - like configurations of large total mass , called scalar stars .    among the many possible scalar fields , the dilaton field has a special theoretical appeal .",
    "it couples in a unique minimal way to electromagnetism to make the maxwell action dimensionless . this coupling leads to star - like objects which are composed of scalar and electromagnetic fields . that such objects can exist",
    "was pointed out by many authors  @xcite .",
    "we argue that such electro - dilaton stars may be responsible for the strong gamma - ray bursts observed in the universe .    at present there exists no simple conventional explanation for the origin of these events reaching us isotropically from all directions of the universe . for an comprehensive discussion of the subject ,",
    "in particular for the failures of most theories , see the article by ruffini @xcite . at the same time , there exist models for the early universe where an initial state of large volume of relativistic plasma quickly expands as a spherical wave , like a critical bubble in an overheated liquid , causing a decay of a false vacuum , and creating the universe from such a bubble  @xcite .",
    "the electro - dilaton stars can supply such an explanation .",
    "we assume that the dark matter in the universe contains a multitude of such objects , whose total mass exceeds by far the total mass of luminous matter and is responsible for the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the luminous matter concentrates in the gravitational potential wells of the scalar fields .",
    "let us imagine that collision of relativistic particles produce a fireball of critical size .",
    "such bubbles have been investigated as possible triggers of phase transitions in the early universe @xcite . in the context of gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "similar assumptions have been made in ref .",
    "the critical bubble forms the seed for transferring effectively scalar fields into pairs of elementary particles and their antiparticles .",
    "the transfer may be initiated by fast oscillation of a field on the outer boundary of the fireball .",
    "the process causes a relativistic detonation . in a conventional detonation",
    ", chemical energy is converted into kinetic energy . in a relativistic detonation of an electro - dilaton star , it is the energy of the electric and scalar fields which is rapidly converted in particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "the resulting fireball expands with relativistic velocity and will therefore not depend on the weak gravitational fields of a newtonian configuration",
    ". we may thus study the process within special relativity .",
    "we begin by deducing the self - similar solutions for a spherical relativistic detonation which goes over to the well - known zeldovich solution in the limit of small velocities  @xcite .",
    "the set of equations of relativistic hydrodynamics is conveniently described in a spherical coordinate system @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath1 denotes the radial velocity of the plasma in three - dimensions  @xcite and @xmath2 is energy density , @xmath3 - pressure , the equation of motion reads @xmath4 while energy conservation requires that @xmath5 + \\frac{1}{\\gamma ^{2}}\\left ( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r}+v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\tau } \\right ) + \\frac{2v}{r}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  and @xmath8 . as in the nonrelativistic case ,",
    "the motion of the plasma behind the detonation front is considered as isentropic , such that ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are the only relevant equations .    the pairs of relativistic particles and antiparticles created behind the wave front generate a high - temperature plasma with the equation of state : @xmath9 where @xmath10  is the sound velocity . as in an ordinary spherical detonation problem , we search for a solution depending on the self - similar variable @xmath11 in which the differential equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) reduce to ordinary differential equations , which can be combined to the equation for @xmath1 : @xmath12 = \\frac{2v}{\\xi } \\frac{\\gamma ^{2}}{1-v\\xi } .\\ ] ] in the nonrelativistic limit where @xmath13 , this equation reduces to a textbook equation  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative analysis of the relativistic equation ( [ eq5 ] ) is similar to the one in the textbook : the solutions for @xmath1  and @xmath14  have a diverging derivative at the wave front .",
    "such singularity of a derivative is defined by the following : the expression in parentheses is velocity of current of plasma in relation to the wave front . according to the theory of detonation , this velocity is equal to sound velocity @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , at approaching to the wave front the expression in brackets tends to zero .",
    "the coordinate of the wave front @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is a velocity of detonation wave in central frame ) and the velocity of gas behind the wave in laboratory frame @xmath18 is uniquely determined from conservation laws at the wave front .",
    "+ fig1.tps    the discussion of possible mechanisms of `` recycling '' of the field behind the wave front into relativistic plasma is considered below .",
    "let us specify here the following estimates of the value of @xmath19  and energy density behind the detonation wave .",

    "we now turn to the mechanism of transition of the field energy into a relativistic plasma .",
    "so far , the description of the conversion of the energy of a scalar field into relativistic plasma at the front of  detonation \" wave is purely phenomenological .",
    "the physical properties of the front of the detonation wave are completely determined by the conservation laws for a general energy - momentum tensor @xmath30 .",
    "one specific mechanism of such a conversion was considered in  @xcite based on an analogy with a laser . here",
    "we shall consider an alternative possibility where the relativistic plasma and radiation are obtained from the energy of a dilaton field .",
    "the star - like configurations for such field with strong and weak ( newtonian ) gravitational field have been considered before  @xcite . as in section [ sec1 ]",
    ", we shall discuss only the case of a weak gravitational field and treat the problem within special relativity .",

    "the transverse magnetic wave is focused in a band of width @xmath89 . outside of this",
    ", the energy density lies mainly in the gradient part of the dilaton field . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn14 ] ) it follows that energy flux density is independent of @xmath90 : @xmath91 this can be interpreted as follows : the conversion of the energy of the dilaton field from the gradient to the potential part implies a conversion of the gradient energy of the dilaton field to the energy of electromagnetic field .",
    "certainly , this conversion is completely reversible .",
    "the above electro - dilaton soliton appears at the front of the detonation wave .",
    "if we use the plasma behind the front as a frame of reference , then this soliton will be move with a velocity @xmath92 in the positive @xmath39-direction .",

    "thus electro - dilaton solitons with dissipation become asymmetric with a steeper front part .",

    "the limiting value for @xmath106 in this example is @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that the whole energy of the dilaton field transforms to the heat energy of plasma .",

    "( [ eqn19 ] ) it is convenient to introduce the new variable @xmath113 which is unity in the absence of dissipation .",
