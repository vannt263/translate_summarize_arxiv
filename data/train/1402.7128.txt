    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been the focus of intense study in the past few decades as they exhibit remarkable properties that make them good candidates for molecular electronic devices.@xmath2 lately cnts spintronics , by combining electronics with spintronics to inject , detect , and manipulate the electron spin in cnts systems , has been gradually regarded as one of the most promising research fields.@xmath3 _ _  _ _ meanwhile their application as building blocks in spintronics has been also addressed.@xmath4 nonetheless , the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) has been customarily underestimated in cnts,@xmath5 due to the low atomic number of carbon @xmath6 .",
    "only recently was it proven experimentally@xmath7 that in the spectrum of ultraclean straight carbon nanotubes ( scnts ) , the effects of this coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom are clearly visible .",
    "this observation is in agreement with previous theoretical predictions,@xmath8 which argued that soi could be significant in scnts due to their curvature .",
    "understanding the effects of this coupling is essential for the successful manipulation of the different degrees of freedom of these systems , thereby affecting the transport properties of electrons , so it s a crucial issue in condensed matter physics and spintronics . to date",
    ", the spin manipulation via soi has been extensively studied in scnts.@xmath9    motivated by this , we further explore the soi effects in the curved cnts .",
    "in fact , some curved cnts ( i.e. ring closure and coil - shaped cnts , etc ) have already been founded in experiment.@xmath10 particularly , the helically coiled carbon nanotubes ( hccnts ) firstly predicted by ihara , itoh , and kitakami,@xmath11  possess nonzero curvature and torsion with two kinds of disclinations ( 5-membered rings and 7-membered rings ) , but they are absent in the simple scnts.@xmath12 because of their potential applications for nano - electronic devices and nano - electromechanical systems , the hccnts have been attracting extensive interest.@xmath13 regrettably , these researches have just focused on the electronic properties without involving the spintronic properties . especially , the law of additional soi induced by the distortion of hccnts and its influence on the movement of electron , _ _  _ _ remain poorly understood .",
    "some other critical problems should be also thoroughly investigated , such as the chirality how to affect the soi ?",
    "does the soi revised by the torsion have any of the new physical effect ?",
    "the most interesting target raised for us is to clarify the role of soi in such nanostructures .",
    "however , because of its complicated configuration , _ _",
    "_ _ the analytical calculations for soi becomes an extremely challenging issue .",
    "these researches have important academic significance on the design of new mesoscopic spin electronic device .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the soi in hccnts by employing the perturbation theory and the tight binding approximation for nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "these methods have been well applied to an infinite graphene and a carbon nanotube , etc.@xmath14 in ref .",

    "_ take two atoms of equal height along the axis of the tube ( i.e. the armchair - scnt ) as the model , and obtain the soi with the angle @xmath16 , in the limit when the radius of curvature is much longer than the interatomic spacing , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 . here",
    "we start from a more general case as two atoms of different height ( i.e. the chiral - scnt ) , and recover the angle @xmath16 including the chiral angle @xmath19 without the limit condition above , and on this basis , we can further clarify the chiral effect on the hccnt s soi . to accomplish this , we introduce an unitary matrix @xmath20 , which has bridged the coordinates between scnt and hccnt . by virtue of the @xmath20 matrix , we derive the analytical solution @xmath21 of soi , and find the @xmath21 for the @xmath0 bands is first order in the atomic carbon soi strength @xmath22",

    "the calculated soi values reach the order of @xmath28ev . to check the validity of @xmath29 , we specially compute five different _ ab initio _ energies of soi for five different hccnts of coiled pitch @xmath30 , and verify the theoretical estimated sois , qualitatively and quantitatively , agree well with realistic _ ab initio _ calculation values .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath31 ,",
    "a brief introduction is given to the details of calculation methods .",
    "finally , we derive the analytic solution of soi . in section",
    "@xmath32 , _ ab initio _ calculations are described , and the results compared with analytic solutions are discussed .",
    "in the last section , we present brief summary and conclusions .",
    "in graphene , the carbon atoms are arranged into a hexagonal lattice connected by strong covalent bonds of @xmath1-orbitals derived from the @xmath33 hybridization of the atomic orbitals .",
    "the remaining @xmath34 orbital ( normal to the atomic plane ) has a weak overlap and forms a narrow band of @xmath0-orbitals states .",
    "to a first approximation , the @xmath0-electron system can be modeled as a tight - binding hamiltonian characterized by a single hopping matrix element between neighboring atoms , and the energy offset of the @xmath35-electron states .",
    "considering the arbitrary atom of pentagon  heptagon pairs in hccnts is still surrounded by three nearest neighbor atoms similar to the hexagon case , we reasonably choose the tight - binding model with a two - center slater - koster approximation@xmath36 for nearest - neighbor hopping in our calculations .",
    "the tight - binding representation of hamiltonian is defined by the combination of the contributions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39here , the spin - independent noninteracting hamiltonian reads @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a shorthand used to denote neighboring atomic sites , @xmath42 refers to the @xmath43 and @xmath34 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 atomic orbitals on each site , and @xmath46 the electronic spin . the term @xmath47 stands for the on - siteatomic energies of 2@xmath43 and 2@xmath35 orbitals , i.e. the site - diagonal matrix elements @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with the latter one @xmath50 . besides , the wannier representation of @xmath37 describes electrons hopping from @xmath51 atomto another , _ _",
    "_ _ @xmath52 .",
    "the strength of the hopping matrix element @xmath53 is controlled by the effective overlap of neighboring atoms .",
    "the tight - binding representation becomes useful when the @xmath53 is non - vanishing , but the orbital overlap is so weak that only nearest - neighbor hopping effectively contributes .",
    "here we use one parameter @xmath54 for the nearest - neighbor hopping between the @xmath55 orbitals of the @xmath0 band , and other parameters of @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the rest of the intra - atomic hoppings between the atomic orbitals @xmath43 , @xmath34 , @xmath44 of the @xmath1 band .",
    "the soi arises @xmath59 @xmath60**,**@xmath61 with the intra - atomic soi constant @xmath22 , the total atomic angular momentum operator @xmath62 , and the total electronic spin operator @xmath63 .    following the approach of ando@xmath64 and guinea@xmath14 _ et al .",
