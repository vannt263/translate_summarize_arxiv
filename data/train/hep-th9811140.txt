    "the amplitudes that we investigate in this paper are ultraviolet finite in four dimensions , and should match the low - energy limit of any corresponding fundamental gravity theory .    the relation between gravity and gauge theory amplitudes",

    "this relation was explicitly verified for @xmath21 . in",

    "in order to go beyond the explicit graviton amplitude calculations for @xmath2 , we use the analytic properties of the two series of amplitudes as the @xmath0-point kinematics approaches special regions .",
    "in particular , we study the soft limits noted above , as well as the limits where two gravitons become collinear . both of these limits for gravity can be understood at tree - level from the corresponding limits in gauge theory , by exploiting the klt relations , as we show in .",
    "we also show that there are no loop corrections to the structure of these limits in the case of gravity ( unlike gauge theory ) . in",

    "furthermore , if we now set @xmath123 , then to @xmath124 the pentagon contributions may be neglected , because the scalar pentagon integrals in @xmath125 have no poles as @xmath126 ( they are infrared and ultraviolet finite in @xmath127 ) , and because they are generated in the integral reduction procedure with a manifest @xmath128 prefactor  @xcite .    for an amplitude in a generic theory , after applying these reductions the box integrals may have powers of the loop momentum @xmath129 inserted in the numerator of the integrand , in addition to the four scalar propagators which make up the denominator . the amplitude may also contain triangle and bubble integrals arising from the corresponding feynman diagrams . the all - plus helicity and @xmath3 supersymmetric cases which we discuss below are special , however , and do not contain the full set of possible scalar integrals .",

    "<S> by exploiting relations between gravity and gauge theories , we present two infinite sequences of one - loop @xmath0-graviton scattering amplitudes : the ` maximally helicity - violating ' amplitudes in @xmath1 supergravity , and the ` all - plus ' helicity amplitudes in gravity with any minimally coupled massless matter content . </S>",
    "<S> the all - plus amplitudes correspond to self - dual field configurations and vanish in supersymmetric theories . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of the tree - level kawai - lewellen - tye ( klt ) relations between open and closed string theory amplitudes , which in the low - energy limit imply relations between gravity and gauge theory tree amplitudes . for @xmath2 , we determine the all - plus amplitudes explicitly from their unitarity cuts . </S>",
    "<S> the klt relations , applied to the cuts , allow us to extend to gravity a previously found ` dimension - shifting ' relation between ( the cuts of ) the all - plus amplitudes in gauge theory and the maximally helicity - violating amplitudes in @xmath3 super - yang - mills theory . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational version of the relation lets us determine the @xmath4 @xmath1 supergravity amplitudes from the all - plus gravity amplitudes . </S>",
