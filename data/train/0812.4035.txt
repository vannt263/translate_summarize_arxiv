    "in treatment planning of radiotherapy with protons and heavier ions , the pencil - beam ( pb ) algorithm is commonly used ( hong 1996 , kanematsu 1998 , 2006 , schaffner 1999 , krmer 2000 ) , where a radiation field is approximately decomposed into two - dimensionally arranged gaussian beams that receive energy loss and multiple scattering in matter . in the presence of heterogeneity",
    ", these beams grow differently to reproduce realistic fluctuation in the superposed dose distribution .",
    "comparisons with measurements and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , however , revealed difficulty of the pb algorithm at places with severe lateral heterogeneity such as steep areas of a range compensator and lateral interfaces among air , tissue , and bone in a patient body ( goitein 1978 , petti 1992 , kohno 2004 , ciangaru 2005 ) .",
    "one reason for the difficulty is that particles in a pencil beam are assumed to receive the same interactions , whereas they may be spatially overreaching beyond the density interface .",
    "the other reason is that only straight paths radiating from a point source are considered in beam transport , whereas actual particles may detour randomly by multiple scattering .",
    "schneider ( 1998 ) showed that a phase - space analysis could address the overreach and detour effects for a simple lateral structure .",
    "schaffner ( 1999 ) and soukup ( 2005 ) subdivided a physical spot beam virtually into smaller beams to naturally reduce overreaches .",
    "pflugfelder ( 2007 ) quantified lateral heterogeneity , with which subdivision and arrangement could be optimized .",
    "unfortunately , those techniques are ineffective against beam - size growth during transport .    for electrons ,",
    "the overreach and detour effects are intrinsically much severer .",
    "shiu and hogstrom ( 1991 ) developed a solution , the pb - redefinition algorithm , where minimal pencil beams are occasionally regenerated , considering electron flows rigorously .",
    "the same idea was in fact partly applied to heavy particles for beam customization ( kanematsu 2008b ) , but the poly - energetic beam model to deal with heterogeneity could be seriously inefficient in high - resolution calculations necessary for bragg peaks .    in this study ,",
    "we develop an alternative method to similarly address the overreach and detour effects . in the following sections , we incorporate our findings on the gaussian distribution into the pb algorithm , test the new method in a carbon - ion beam experiment , and discuss the results and practicality for clinical applications .",
    "the pb algorithm in this study basically follows our former works ( kanematsu 1998 , 2006 , 2008b ) .",

    "the pencil beams are examined at every transport step in a patient .",

    "subdivision of a radiation field into virtual pencil beams is an arbitrary process in the pb algorithm although the beam sizes and intervals should be limited by lateral heterogeneity of a given system . in the pb - redefinition algorithm ( siu and hogstrom 1991 ) ,",
    "beams are defined in uniform rectilinear grids and hence regeneration in areas with little heterogeneity may be potentially wasteful . in the beam - splitting method",
    ", beams are automatically optimized in accordance with local heterogeneity . in other words ,",
    "the field will be covered by minimum number of beams in a density - modulated manner as a result of individual independent self - similar splitting .",
    "relative errors in similarity , @xmath166 ( @xmath31 ) , are maximum at @xmath152 with values @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 .",
    "the resultant dose errors would be smaller , due to contributions of other beams , and may be tolerable .",
    "effectiveness of the splitting method was demonstrated in the experiment .",
    "the most prominent detour effect was the loss of range - compensated main - peak component in ( c ) , which amounted to about 10% in dose and approximately as large as the distortion due to lateral particle disequilibrium .",
    "the splitting calculation and the measurement generally agreed well , considering that the experimental errors in device alignment could have been 1 mm or more .",
    "the potential sub peak for particles detouring around both pmma plates was not detected , which may be natural because detouring itself requires scattering .",
    "the dose resolution of the mcic system of about 1% of the maximum should have also limited the detectability .    in the applications to the heterogeneous phantom model , although we do nt have reference data to compare the results with , it is natural that the splitting calculation with finer beams resulted in finer structures in the dose distributions .",
    "computational time is always a concern in practice . in our example , the slowing factor for beam splitting with respect to non - splitting calculation was almost common to carbon ions and protons and the speed performance , a minute for 2-l volume in 1-mm grids , may be already acceptable for clinical applications .    in principle , the total path length determines the computational amount for path integrals  and the total effective volume determines that for dose convolution . their influences on the actual computational time will depend on algorithmic implementations ( kanematsu 2008a ) .",
    "in fact , the slowing factor for splitting was less than 5 , which is even better than either estimation .",
    "in addition to common overhead that should have superficially reduced the factor , our code optimization with algorithmic techniques , which will be reported elsewhere , could have contributed to the performance .",
    "accuracy and speed also depend strongly on the cutoff parameters and logical conditions in the implemented algorithm , size and heterogeneity of a patient model , and resolution clinically needed for a dose distribution .",
    "the automatic multiplication of tracking elements resembles a shower process in physical particle interactions usually calculated in mc simulations .",
    "in fact , mc simulations for dose calculation share many things in common .",
    "transport and stacking of the elements are essentially the same and the probability for scattering may be equivalent to the distribution in the gaussian approximation . as far as efficiency is concerned ,",
    "the essential differences from the mc method are that the pb method deals with much less number of elements and that it does not rely on stochastic behavior of random numbers .",
    "the beam - splitting method is based on a simple principle of self - similarity and can be applied to any gaussian beam model of any particle type to fill the gap between monte carlo particle simulations and conventional beam calculations in terms of accuracy and efficiency .",
    "however , it is difficult for beam splitting or any beam model in general to deal with interactions that deteriorate particle uniformity , such as nuclear fragmentation processes ( matsufuji 2005 ) .",
    "in this work , we applied our finding of self - similar nature of gaussian distributions to dose calculation of heavy charged particle radiotherapy .",
    "the self - similarity enables dynamic , individual , and independent splitting of gaussian beams that have been grown larger than the limit from lateral heterogeneity of the medium . as a result",
    ", pencil beams will be arranged with optimum and modulated areal density to minimize overreaching and to address detouring with deflecting daughter beams .    in comparison with a conventional calculation and a measurement ,",
    "the splitting calculation was prominently effective in the target region with steep range adjustment by an upstream range compensator .",
    "the detour effect was about 10% for the maximum and of the same order of magnitude with lateral particle disequilibrium effect . in comparison between carbon ions and protons , the effects of splitting were not significantly different because other scattering effects were also larger for protons .",
    "although performances depend strongly on physical beam conditions , clinical requirement , and algorithmic implementation , a typical slowing factor of the order of 10 may be reasonably achievable for involvement of beam splitting .",
    "in fact , factor of 5 has been achieved in our example .",
    "the principle and formulation for beam splitting are general and thus the feature may be added to various implementations of the pb algorithm in a straightforward manner .",
