    "a recent study of observations of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) suggest there are systematic variations where the imf gets flatter , or more top - heavy , in denser regions ( elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "this paper proposes that the high mass part of the imf varies with density as a result of the coalescence of dense pre - stellar condensations ( pscs ) , such as those observed by motte , andr , & neri ( 1998 ) , testi & sargent ( 1998 ) , onishi et al .",

    "this could be a power law if the psc formation process is scale - free , or it could be log - normal if there is a characteristic mass and some type of random multiplicative fragmentation or build - up . to illustrate how apparently power law imfs can result from imfs with a characteristic mass , the model considers a log - normal intrinsic spectrum of psc mass",

    "the total integration time is one dynamical time in the cloud core , @xmath78 .",
    "evidently coalescence in dense clusters can turn a steep intrinsic imf into one that resembles a salpeter function , with a slope of @xmath79 or shallower .",
    "the same spontaneous imf without collisions would have a slope of @xmath80 or steeper , depending on the mass range .",
    "we considered a cluster with nonuniform density profile and known mass and radius , in which pscs can move approximately with virial velocity . considering collisions between pscs and their gravitational collapse ,",
    "a differential equation is presented and solved numerically which gives number density distribution of pscs inside the cloud at each radius , mass interval and time . in order to control the collision and the collapse rates in a phenomenological way",
    ", some input parameters are introduced .",
    "we explored a wide range of input parameters and the results were qualitatively the same as those reported here . in some starburst regions",
    "a high fraction of high mass stars compared to low mass stars has been reported which means a high mass bias ( e.g. , sternberg 1998 ; smith & gallagher 2001 ) .",
    "our results suggest this shift in high mass part of imfs in these starburst clusters may originates from pscs coalescence .",
    "elmegreen ( 2004 ) discussed how various physical processes operating in at least three mass regimes may lead to three components imf .",
    "this point is demonstrated by reviewing the observations of imf variations and using two simple models showing the observed power law distributions do not necessarily imply a single scale free star formation mechanism ( elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "our work in this paper confirms this expectation by presenting a simple model for collisions between psc in clusters and its possible effect on imf .",
    "of course , we did not intend to fit the imf with a particular coalescence model , but showing that the high mass part of imf in a composite model as suggested by elmegreen ( 2004 ) , may change due to interactions between pcs .",
