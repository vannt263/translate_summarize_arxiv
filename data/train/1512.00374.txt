    "importantly , beyond the detection of each passing charge , at higher @xmath9 when the detector can no longer resolve the individual tunneling events , we show that the rarely occurring pumping errors can nevertheless be readily counted , thus taking the first step towards metallic turnstile operation with error accounting .",
    "more generally , our work serves as the first demonstration of pumping error detection at operation frequencies exceeding the detector bandwidth , in a configuration that allows simultaneous measurement of the average pumped current : very accurate error detection with a slow detector is routinely performed with metallic fully normal - state electron pumps  @xcite but only in a @xmath10 shuttling mode  @xcite . on the other hand , with semiconductor quantum dot pumps where directional error counting has already been successfully realized at low repetition rates  @xcite , operation at higher duty cycles has not been reported yet .",

    "direct measurement of the cutoff frequency for missed tunneling constitutes one example .",

    "such a configuration , however , can not directly discriminate cpe events from regular one - electron tunneling . in contrast , in the scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] where the superconducting counting node is now monitored instead , cpe and ar , both changing the charge state by @xmath99 , can be distinguished by their differing dependencies on the bias voltage @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , in a setup with at least three series turnstiles and two monitored counting nodes , these tunneling events can be directly labeled based on the detector signals . for investigating the cpe process , it is advantageous to have a coulomb blockaded island . in the configuration of ref .",

    "<S> we perform in - situ detection of individual electrons pumped through a single - electron turnstile based on ultrasmall normal metal  </S>",
    "<S> insulator  superconductor tunnel junctions . in our setup , limited by the detector bandwidth , at low repetition rates we observe errorless sequential transfer of up to several hundred electrons through the system . at faster pumping speeds up to @xmath0 , we show relative error rates down to @xmath1 , comparable to typical values obtained from measurements of average pumped current in non - optimized individual turnstiles . </S>",
    "<S> the work constitutes an initial step towards a self - referenced current standard realized with metallic single - electron turnstiles , complementing approaches based on semiconductor quantum dot pumps . </S>",
    "<S> it is the first demonstration of on - chip pumping error detection at operation frequencies exceeding the detector bandwidth , in a configuration where the average pumped current can be simultaneously measured . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme in which electrons are counted from the superconducting lead of the turnstile , instead of direct probing of the normal metal island , also enables studies of fundamental higher - order tunneling processes in the hybrid structures , previously not in reach with simpler configurations . </S>"
