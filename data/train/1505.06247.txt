    "indeed , theorem 2.2 is a simple consequence of theorem 3.2 , when @xmath75 for @xmath18 , because in that cases all conditions of theorem 3.2 are fulfilled .",
    "we say that @xmath76 is partition of @xmath4 if @xmath77 .",
    "we say that a real - valued function @xmath29 on @xmath4 is simple function if there exists a partition @xmath76 of @xmath4 and a sequence of real numbers @xmath78 such that @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "we have the following proposition .",

    "suppose that @xmath86 does not remain a zero value on @xmath4 and @xmath87 for @xmath48 and @xmath88 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are defined by ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) .",
    "suppose also that fourier coefficients of the function @xmath29 standing in the right side of the equation ( 3.1 ) satisfy the following condition @xmath89",
    ".    then the function @xmath57 , defined by @xmath90 @xmath91 for @xmath7 , satisfies ( 3.1)(3.2 ) at each point of the set @xmath92 .",

    "let us consider an ordinary differential equation @xmath101    note that for ( 3.8 ) all conditions of theorem 2.2 are fulfilled .",

    "similarly , the equation ( 3.8 ) with ( 3.2 ) coincides with the equation ( 3.1 ) with ( 3.2 ) at all point @xmath105 .",
