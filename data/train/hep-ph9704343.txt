    "anomalous high-@xmath0 events recently observed at hera by the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations have provoked much efforts of their explanation within different theoretical frameworks  @xcite .",
    "the proposed explanations are contact interactions , leptoquarks and signals of @xmath1-parity violation in supersymmetric interactions .",
    "the contact interactions do not give us satisfactory explanation of either the shape of @xmath0 distribution of hera events or the distribution over the @xmath6 invariant mass which has a peak around 200 gev .",
    "we would like to take a fresh look at the possibility of @xmath1-parity violation providing a @xmath7-channel resonance at hera .",
    "the starting point for our analysis is the superpotential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath1-violating terms included @xmath8    the terms with @xmath9 and @xmath10 violate a lepton number while the last term with @xmath11 violates a barion number . @xmath12 and @xmath13 operators ,",
    "if they exist simultaneously , lead to a fast proton decay  @xcite .",
    "thus , only one kind of operators is allowed .",
    "hera events can be explained in the framework of the @xmath1-parity broken susy model only if @xmath14 .",
    "that is why we hereafter consider the case when @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 -terms result in the following lagrangian for component fields :    @xmath16_f + h.c.,\\\\ l_{{\\mbox{$\\rlap{\\kern0.25em/}r_p$}},{\\lambda}'}&=&{\\lambda}'_{ijk}[\\tilde{\\nu}_{il}\\bar{d}_{kr}d_{jl}+ \\tilde{d}_{jl}\\bar{d}_{kr}\\nu_{il}+ { \\tilde{d}^*}_{kl}\\overline{(\\nu_{il})^c}d_{jl } - { \\nonumber}\\\\ & & \\tilde{e}_{il}\\bar{d}_{kr}u_{jl}-\\tilde{u}_{jl}\\bar{d}_{kr}e_{il}- { \\tilde{d}^*}_{kl}\\overline{(e_{il})^c}u_{jl } ]   + h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the present experimental limits on different couplings are presented in table  [ limits ] .    .",
    "[ limits ] the strictest experimental bounds on @xmath1-parity violating couplings .",
    "limits derived from the following processes : a ) charged - current universality , b ) @xmath17 mass ; c ) neutrinoless double beta - decay ; d ) @xmath18 ; e ) atomic parity violation and @xmath19 asymmetry . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     bounds shown in table  [ limits ] scale with the following factors :    a ) , d ) and e )  @xmath20 ;    \\b )  @xmath21 ;    \\c )  @xmath22",
    "the purpose of the present letter is to re - examine the possible explanation of the excess of high @xmath0 neutral current dis events at hera assuming @xmath1-parity violation and discuss its possible check at lep200 and tevatron .",
    "it should be stressed that all analytical and the most part of numerical calculations have been made by the comphep package  @xcite.this package allows one to perform the complete tree level calculations in the framework of any fed model .",
    "we have implemented into this program the part of supersymmetric standard model with r - parity violating terms relevant for our analysis .",
    "to describe hera anomalous events , we used data obtained by these collaborations when 10 events survived after the @xmath23 gev@xmath24 cut , while only 4 events were expected according to standard model predictions .",
    "we also took into account the integrated luminosity zeus+h1 equal to 34.4  pb@xmath25 and an average detector efficiency 0.8 .    in our calculations we used the cteq3 m structure function  @xcite and @xmath0 scale @xmath26 .",
    "the total cross section describing the observed data turned out to be 0.36  pb , while the standard model gives only 0.16  pb . five events observed by the h1 collaboration ( @xmath23  gev@xmath24 ) have a clear peak for @xmath27 gev .",
    "zeus events are more spread over @xmath28 , but also have a mean value around 200 gev .",
    "that is why the natural mass of sparticles describing these events is 200 gev .",
    "we have calculated the complete set of feynman diagrams of the process @xmath29 in the framework of the @xmath1-broken supersymmetric model for hera energy .",
    "the relevant graphs are shown in fig.[diag - hera ] . as is naturally expected",
    "the main contribution comes from diagrams with a resonant squark in the @xmath7-channel ( 99% ) .",
    "contributions from the @xmath30-channel diagrams are negligible ( 1% ) for the case under consideration . however , these diagrams give the same order contribution as a _ nonresonant _ @xmath7-channel diagram with a heavy sparticle , but this is not the subject of our study .",
    "we use values for @xmath1-parity violating yukawa couplings , which satisfy existing limits , see table  [ limits ] .",
    "we assumed all couplings non - zero .",
    "couplings @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 were fixed at their upper bounds coming from the electron neutrino mass limits .",
    "the rest @xmath35s were put equal to each other and varied in the allowed range .",
    "the presence of non - zero couplings implies the branching ratio @xmath36 to be smaller than unity , even if the @xmath1-parity conserving decay channel is suppressed .",
    "for the values of @xmath10 s under consideration we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "due to the smallness of @xmath31 the diagram with the @xmath39 exchange is neglected hereafter .",
    "we obtained the value of @xmath10 equal to 0.047 which describes the event excess in hera data with the 200 gev @xmath7-channel squark resonance .",
    "this value is higher than the 0.024 limit coming from  @xcite .",
    "but the limit on coupling in  @xcite was obtained under the assumption that only one @xmath40 was non - zero , which is not the case of this study , and as it was shown in  @xcite this limit can be relaxed .",
    "figure  [ dist - q ] shows the @xmath0 distribution for the standard model and susy model with broken @xmath1-parity tuned to describe data , and combined zeus+h1 data distribution itself .",
    "one can see that the shape of deviation from sm is perfectly described by the @xmath7-channel squark resonance .",
    "having in mind that processes with @xmath1-parity violation could occur in @xmath41 collisions at lep , we consider the possibility of detecting it in the pair @xmath42 production via sparticle exchange .",
    "comparing to the standard model , some excess in dijet production is expected . for this purpose",
    ", we have calculated the complete set of relevant diagrams presented in fig.[diag - lep ] .",
    "hereafter , we assume that sleptons have mass 200 gev if not mentioned specially .",
    "there is a big difference in the up and down quark production .",
    "there is an additional @xmath7-channel diagram with sneutrino for the down quark production , which makes the total cross section dependent not only on @xmath10 but also on @xmath9 values .",
    "if we put @xmath9 equal to its upper limit ( 0.2 ) , see table  [ limits ] , then we will have @xmath43 deviation @xmath44  pb of the total cross section from the standard model for @xmath45  gev lep . in our calculation",
    "we put the value of @xmath10 to those describing hera data  0.047 .",
    "the dependence of the total @xmath46 cross section on @xmath10 is shown in fig.[lep]a ) . the value of @xmath9 of an order of 0.1 - 0.2 leads to the 15 - 25% excess in the @xmath47 production cross section .",
    "this deviation from the sm @xmath48 prediction can be measured at lep . as for the up quark production ,",
    "@xmath30-channel diagrams bring a very small negative contribution for values of @xmath9 s under consideration .",
    "the dependence of the total @xmath49 cross section as a function of @xmath10 is shown in fig.[lep]b ) .",
    "one could expect some contribution of a 200 gev susy particle to the very accurately measured @xmath48 value for lep90 which is equal to @xmath50 and still has 1.5@xmath51 deviation from theoretical predictions .",
    "but it turned out that for @xmath52  gev the contribution from additional diagrams to the @xmath47 production was only 0.021 pb , while the total production @xmath47 rate was 9040 pb .",
    "thus , this additional susy contribution changes @xmath48 only in the 6-th digit .",
    "( -160,220)a ) ( -140,220)@xmath53 ( -140,210)@xmath45  gev ( 70,220)b ) ( 90,220)@xmath54 ( 90,210)@xmath45  gev    though limits on @xmath9 s are not so strict , it seems unnatural if their values are much higher than @xmath10 .",
    "so we would like to look at the case when @xmath9 is small or equal to 0 and the excess of the @xmath47 production is absent .",
    "for example , for @xmath55 the @xmath47 production deviates from the standard model only by 5% . by a lucky chance we have at present three different colliders with energy of an order of 1 tev : lepton - lepton  lep , lepton - hadron  hera and hadron - hadron  tevatron .",
    "these machines are highly complementary to each other .",
    "we show below that possible failure to find @xmath1-parity broken susy ( if it really exists ) at lep leads to the luck at tevatron in this search and vice versa .    for tevatron one of the the most interesting effects of revealing @xmath1-parity violation can be the resonance single top production via a slepton decay .",
    "the complete set of feynman diagrams for the @xmath56 process of single top production is shown in fig.[diag - tev ] .",
    "( -160,220)a ) ( -140,220)@xmath57 ( -140,210)@xmath58  tev ( 70,220)b ) ( 90,220)@xmath53 ( 90,210)@xmath45  gev    in spite of that the cross section is directly proportional only to @xmath10 , there is also dependence of the cross section on the @xmath9 coupling which is directly related to the width and branching ratios of the selectron decay . for comparatively big @xmath9 ( 0.1 - 0.2 )",
    "the selectron mainly decays leptonically and the single top production is suppressed . in this case , the deviation in the @xmath47 production could be measured at lep . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath9 is small or even equal to 0 , there is a significant contribution to the single top production via the resonant selectron diagram",
    ". this contribution can be as large as 100% of the total single top production rate of sm @xmath59 .",
    "it is clearly illustrated in fig  [ tev ] where the dependence of this deviation versus @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is fixed to 0.047 ) is shown . if we assume the total cross section of the single top @xmath60 @xmath61 production including nlo corrections @xcite ( we use nlo k - factor 1.5 ) to be about 0.9 pb , for @xmath9= 0.0  0.1 the deviation from the sm prediction is 50100% .",
    "the same effect is expected for the @xmath62 fusion single top production process which is a separate subject of study and not discussed here .",
    "we can see that by lucky coincidence lep and tevatron magically complement each other in search for supersymmetry with broken @xmath1-parity , which naturally describes high @xmath0 hera events .",
    "we have demonstrated that hera events can be explained within the supersymmetric standard model with broken @xmath1-parity .",
    "the yukawa couplings responsible for processes under study do not exceed their experimental bounds .",
    "processes with @xmath1-parity breaking can also take place in @xmath41 collisions at lep200 and tevatron , which are complementary to each other .",
    "if @xmath1-parity violation really takes place , as has been shown above , it can be revealed at either tevatron or lep in the near future .",
