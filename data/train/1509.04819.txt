    "we would like to express our appreciation to gustavo da silva ferreira and dani gamerman ( hereafter ,  ) for their paper on bayesian preferential spatial sampling ( @xcite ) and to the editor of _ bayesian analysis _ for the opportunity to contribute to the discussion .",
    "building on the papers by  @xcite and  @xcite , the authors give a bayesian approach to choosing _ new _ sampling locations after initial data are assumed to have been obtained under preferential sampling .",
    "let the initial sample be @xmath0 , obtained at preferential sampling locations @xmath1 ; note that we have emphasised dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 through the notation @xmath3 , but it is exactly the same as what   notate as @xmath2 .",
    "the observation locations @xmath1 and the observations @xmath0 are known by the statistician designing the next phase of the study , and hence all criteria and inferences should depend on both @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "one can see this most clearly in  s definition of the bayesian design criterion @xmath4 , given at the beginning of  -section 4 . however",
    ", the reader should notice that equations  -(3 ) and  -(4 ) do not emphasise conditioning on @xmath1 , along with @xmath0 , something we assume is an oversight on the part of the authors .",
    "it helped us to augment the notation for the utility function from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ; and likewise we suggest that the expected utility be notated : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is considered fixed and the expectation is taken over @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "when there are many `` stakeholders '' ( e.g. , in an environmental study ) , each coming with his / her own utility function , how can a single utility function be constructed ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) opt for one based on entropy .",
    "do the authors have any other suggestions to build `` compromise '' into a utility function ?",
    "notation is really important in these complex situations , so in the case of the utility function defined by  -(4 ) , which involves the latent process ( not the observations ) , we suggest that @xmath10 be rewritten as : @xmath11 that is , @xmath12 replaces @xmath13 in @xmath10 .",
    "depending on the context , @xmath10 could be a function of the new observations , @xmath14 , or of the corresponding latent process , @xmath15 ; recall that   have defined @xmath16 to be a noisy , shifted version of the mean - zero latent process @xmath17 .    in the rest of our discussion , we follow the authors lead and use , albeit with our modified notation that emphasises dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the utility - function approach to optimal design is attractive , but it will only be truly useful when components that quantify `` how much ? '' and `` why ? ''",
    "are specifically included ; see sections  [ section : spatial ] and  [ section : utility ] for further discussion .    as   make clear , the process @xmath17",
    ", the sampling locations @xmath18 , and the observations @xmath19 have a possibly complex joint distribution . following  @xcite , the authors put structure on this joint distribution by assuming  -(1 ) ,  -(2 ) , and a log - gaussian cox process . from the point of view of sample survey design ,",
    "the information in @xmath1 and @xmath0 is comparable to what one would gain from a pilot study , but it requires knowledge of components of @xmath20 in order to make the pilot study operational .",
    "the following suggestion seems compatible with the authors approach to optimal design via preferential sampling .",
    "it is hard to design a study if there is no knowledge from which to draw . in the pre - pilot phase",
    ", one might choose a simple random sample which , in the spatial context , means that observation locations are sampled uniformly from the spatial region of interest , @xmath21 .",
    "we note that this corresponds to a degenerate case of preferential sampling where @xmath22 , the coefficient of @xmath17 in the log - intensity , is equal to @xmath23 , and we also note the presence of randomness in this pre - pilot phase .    after gaining knowledge to make the pilot study operational , @xmath24 and @xmath0",
    "are obtained from preferential sampling , and again we note the presence of randomness in choosing @xmath1 . given @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the next set of locations , @xmath25 , need to be chosen , for which there will be a corresponding ( based on the latent vector @xmath26 ) @xmath13 .",
    "this is the problem considered by  , and their solution follows closely the proposal of  @xcite .",
    "but there is an important difference :  @xcite considers @xmath8 to be a `` design parameter '' that he clearly treats as non - stochastic ( fixed ) .",
    "we would like to ask   the following question : if @xmath1 is considered to be random in the pilot phase , why would @xmath8 be treated as fixed in the main phase of the study ?",
    "the authors follow  @xcite s  @xcite proposal closely but , in our opinion , they lose an opportunity to build a sequential - sampling - design strategy that updates the posterior distribution for @xmath20 and @xmath17 through _ random _ sampling from the distribution @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "this can be obtained from @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29=[\\mathbf{d}|\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot)][\\mathbf{x}|s(\\cdot)]$ ] .",
    "the second factor in the product is a log - gaussian cox process on @xmath21 , and the first factor is presumably a log - gaussian cox process too , but on @xmath30 .",
    "can the authors comment on our suggestion that designed randomness be used to obtain @xmath8 ?",
    "the following section makes strong links between  s proposal and the survey - sampling literature .",
    "it also reinforces the general desire for a component of randomisation in the design .",
    "the development in   ( and in the literature that it refers to ) frames the sampling problem as the selection of a set of points on a grid that `` covers '' the region of interest , @xmath21 . from this perspective",
    ", it is a special case of a finite - population sampling problem , with the @xmath31 grid points defining the population , and with two random quantities defined on these points .",
    "the first is the sample - selection process that results in @xmath1 ( from the pilot study ) and @xmath8 ( from the main survey ) .",
    "the second is the latent process @xmath17 , from which `` noisy '' observations @xmath3 and @xmath13 are taken at @xmath1 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the aim of a spatial sampling design should be to specify a suitable procedure for making a draw from the distribution of @xmath8 given @xmath1 and @xmath0 ; see our discussion in section  [ sect : fixedrandom ] .",
    "what is meant by `` suitable '' depends crucially on the target of inference for the sampling exercise ;   make their target @xmath17 and to a lesser extent @xmath20 , and they assume that `` suitability '' can be characterised through a utility function @xmath10 .",
    "their optimal sample @xmath8 is then the set of ( presumably so far unsampled ) grid points that maximise the expected value of this utility , where recall that the expectation is with respect to the joint distribution of @xmath20 and @xmath12 conditional on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the authors optimal - design procedure is explicitly model - based .",
    "furthermore , the fact that selection of @xmath8 depends on a log - gaussian cox process with intensity function that is a function of @xmath17 means that the sampling design is informative ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.4 ) , which  @xcite and   refer to as preferential sampling .",
    "that is , one can not treat the realised value of @xmath8 as ancillary when using the combined pilot - study and main - survey data to make inferences .",
    "there is a well developed theory in the sample - survey literature for the analysis of a sample collected via informative sampling ; see  @xcite . from this perspective",
    ", the use of a log - gaussian cox process as a model for @xmath1 is equivalent to poisson sampling with inclusion probabilities that depend on the values of @xmath17 over the grid defining the finite population .",
    "we would like to draw attention to an extensive literature on this type of sampling and its implications , including many bayesian approaches ; see  @xcite .",
    "more complex informative - sampling methods have also been investigated , principally in the context of sampling spatially clustered populations ; see  @xcite for a bayesian specification and , in the context of sampling on networks , see  @xcite .",
    "awareness of this closely related literature would seem advantageous for further development of the ideas set out in  s paper .",
    "the main inferential paradigm in survey sampling is design - based inference , which assumes that @xmath16 is fixed , and all inference is relative to the distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the outcome of the pilot study ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) is treated as fixed .",
    "generally , the survey - sampling approach is based on frequentist inference about population summary statistics .",
    "the inference uses weights obtained from the randomisation in the design , along with the population values @xmath16 over the grid . in the simplest case ,",
    "these weights are defined by the inverses of the inclusion probabilities for each of the elements of @xmath8 , but more general `` calibrated '' weights are typically preferred ; see  @xcite . when informative ( i.e. preferential ) sampling is used , design - based inference , although theoretically still applicable , becomes problematic in practice . in order to carry out the survey sampling",
    ", one has to have access to the distribution of @xmath8 , which depends on the latent process @xmath17 .",
    "for design - based inference , one might try replacing @xmath17 in the intensity function of the log - gaussian cox process with @xmath32 , a spatial covariate whose value is known for every point on the grid and which is ( hopefully ) highly correlated with @xmath17 .",
    "this is the model underpinning size - biased sampling ; see  @xcite .",
    "a model - based approach seems therefore necessary under preferential sampling , such as assuming a spatial - statistical model for @xmath17 .",
    "however , this does not mean that the basic design - based notions of randomisation , stratification , and clustering can not be used in a preferential - sampling approach , since they are all useful tools that lead to a better representation of a heterogeneous population .",
    "in particular , what happens when the model  -(1 ) and  -(2 ) does not adequately describe the spatial variability in @xmath16 and @xmath17 ?",
    "the optimality of @xmath33 , and the validity of any consequent inference depends critically on the appropriateness of this model .",
    "this is clearly a weakness , should the design be for a highly scrutinised environmental study where scientists are worried not only about the environment but also about the team of lawyers waiting to litigate ! other problems arise when there are relatively few such choices of @xmath8 , irrespective of the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , all of whose utilities are comparable .",
    "we would like to reiterate that some form of randomisation in a design is always a good idea , because it offers protection against a biased ( unintentional or intentional ) choice of sample sites ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps more importantly , randomisation ensures that an updated fit of an assumed model for @xmath17 can be validly assessed from sample data and that replication - based ideas can be used for this purpose . and",
    "finally , when the parametric model is in doubt , the presence of randomisation allows the possibility that design - based inference could be used .",
    "as far as we are aware , there has been no work on `` robustifying '' inference based on data collected via preferential sampling , in order to make it less sensitive to model misspecification .",
    "perhaps  s paper will stimulate such investigations .",
    "recent research reported in  @xcite may provide an indication of how a robust preferential - sampling approach might work , with these authors developing an approach to sampling design that minimises the maximum prediction error in a _",
    "neighbourhood _ of an assumed model for @xmath17",
    ". a related line of research concerns what could be termed as a composite approach to preferential sampling , where a proportion of the sampling effort is randomly spread over the spatial grid , with the rest allocated to a more targeted preferential sampling design . an important research question here",
    "concerns how this allocation might be determined , based on the information in @xmath1 and @xmath3 ; this is discussed further in section  [ section : utility ] .",
    "we conclude this section by stating some basic elements of a good sampling design , be it spatial or not .",
    "a good design will stratify to ensure sampling over a range of levels of factors or a range of values of covariates .",
    "a good design will specify , in advance , inference thresholds and determine the number of observations per stratum needed to achieve those thresholds .",
    "such designs create a rational basis for the inevitable compromise between the cost of the study and the ability to make scientific inferences from incomplete and noisy data ( e.g. @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , a good design will involve a component of designed randomness , from which non - parametric , design - based inference is also possible , should the model - based assumptions be in doubt .",
    "the process @xmath17 and the behaviour of the observations @xmath3 depend on parameters , which are denoted as @xmath20 . if @xmath20 were known , then @xmath34=\\left[\\mathbf{y_x}|\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot),\\theta\\right]\\left[\\mathbf { x},s(\\cdot)|\\theta\\right]$ ] , and the predictive distribution is @xmath35=\\left[\\mathbf { y_x}|\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot),\\theta\\right]\\left[\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot)|\\theta \\right]/\\left[\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y_x}|\\theta\\right].\\ ] ] using the terminology of  @xcite , an _ empirical hierarchical model ( ehm ) _ results if an estimate @xmath36 is used in place of @xmath20 in ( [ eq : pred - dist ] ) , and inference on @xmath17 is then based on the _ empirical _ predictive distribution , @xmath37=[\\mathbf { y_x}|\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot),\\widehat{\\theta}][\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot)|\\widehat { \\theta}]/[\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y_x}|\\widehat{\\theta}].\\ ] ] this ehm set - up is what  @xcite use , and they address the importance of making @xmath36 a function of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 .    if there is uncertainty in @xmath20 that can be expressed in terms of a prior probability distribution @xmath38 $ ] , then a _ bayesian hierarchical model ( bhm ) _ results .",
    "bayes theorem yields the posterior distribution , @xmath39=\\left[\\mathbf { y_x}|\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot),\\theta\\right]\\left[\\mathbf{x},s(\\cdot)|\\theta \\right]\\left[\\theta\\right]/\\left[\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y_x}\\right].\\ ] ] for a bhm , the _ bayesian _",
    "predictive distribution is the integral of ( [ eq : pd ] ) with respect to @xmath20 , namely @xmath40\\mathrm{d}\\theta$ ] .",
    "the bhm is coherent in the sense that all inferences emanate from a well defined joint probability distribution . on the other hand",
    ", it requires specification of a prior @xmath38 $ ] , and it often consumes a large amount of computing resources .",
    "the ehm represents a compromise that may achieve computational efficiency .",
    "@xcite do _ not _ address optimal spatial design in the way that   do .",
    "if one sets about doing it , analogous to  s approach but within  @xcite s ehm framework , one would modify so that the right - hand side would be the expectation taken over @xmath41 $ ] , and hence one would write the expected utility as @xmath42 . then the _ empirical _ utility is @xmath43 and , analogous to  s approach , one would find the ehm - optimal @xmath8 by maximising @xmath44 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "is there a more principled way to account for @xmath20 ( which is considered fixed but unknown ) in the ehm framework ?",
    "let @xmath45 denote all the unknowns in  s model .",
    "let @xmath46 be one of many possible decisions about @xmath47 based on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "some decisions are better than others , which can be quantified through a very general utility function that is bounded above , and which we denote as @xmath48 ; the utility function , @xmath10 , used by   represents a particular form of the more general @xmath49 considered here .",
    "note that @xmath49 should account for `` how much ? '' and `` why ? '' and could be negative .",
    "obviously , large utilities are preferred , and it is a consequence of decision theory ( e.g.  @xcite ) that the optimal decision is : @xmath50    now suppose that the goal is inference on @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a known , scientifically interpretable , possibly multivariate function of @xmath47 .",
    "the answer to this inference problem is found in the predictive distribution , @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath54 denote a generic predictor of @xmath51 .",
    "mean _ of the predictive distribution of @xmath51 , namely @xmath55 , is a commonly used predictor , but this is just one of many possibly summaries of @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "why use the mean ?",
    "because it is straightforward to show that @xmath56 solves ( [ eq : opt - dec ] ) when the utility function is `` negative squared - error , '' @xmath57 . however , a negative squared - error utility assumes equal consequences for under - estimation as for over - estimation , which is not appropriate when @xmath51 represents extreme events , such as crop failure due to drought .",
    "notice that we have written the utility as a function of all the unknowns , @xmath47 , and a decision about all the unknowns , @xmath58 .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to design for making inference on @xmath33 simultaneously with making inference on @xmath20 , for example .",
    "recall from section  [ section : spatial ] our discussion of the composite approach to optimal design .",
    "one of the components of @xmath20 might be the derivative of the variogram of @xmath17 at the origin ( a critical parameter for kriging ) , which we simultaneously want to infer along with predicting the hidden spatial process @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite give a composite spatial design that distributes sampling locations regularly over @xmath21 ( for inference on @xmath17 ) and , around some of those locations , further locations are chosen very close together ( for inference on @xmath20 ) .",
