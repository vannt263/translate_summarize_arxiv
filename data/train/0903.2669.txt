    "pressure plays an important role for the structure formation in the universe .",
    "pressure determines the jeans scale , @xmath4 , below which the growth of structure slows down , and eventually stops and oscillates : while fluctuations in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) and the pressured component evolve in the same way above the jeans scale , their evolutions are significantly different below the jeans scale .",
    "the dominant source of gravity is cdm , which is cold and its velocity dispersion is negligible before the collapse of halos .",
    "however , the sub - dominant matter components - baryons and neutrinos - have significant velocity dispersions , which should be included in the calculation when precision is required . while the accurate calculations have been done for the linear perturbations , the effects of the pressure on the non - linear evolution of matter fluctuations on cosmological scales ( @xmath5  mpc ) have not been studied very much in the literature .",

    "this enables us to study the effects of the pressure on the non - linear evolution of matter fluctuations in a self - consistent manner .",

    "thus , one implication of our result is that the temperature of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) obtained from the lyman-@xmath3 forests at @xmath187 by @xcite might have been underestimated by a factor of two .",
    "a factor of @xmath186 change in the filtering scale gives a factor of @xmath188 change in the filtering mass .",

    "<S> we calculate the non - linear matter power spectrum using the 3rd - order perturbation theory without ignoring the pressure gradient term . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a semi - realistic system consisting of two matter components with and without pressure , and both are expanded into the 3rd order in perturbations in a self - consistent manner , for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> while the pressured component may be identified with baryons or neutrinos , in this paper we mainly explore the physics of the non - linear pressure effect using a toy model in which the jeans length does not depend on time , i.e. , the sound speed decreases as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> the linear analysis shows that the power spectrum below the so - called filtering scale is suppressed relative to the power spectrum of the cold dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> our non - linear calculation shows that the actual filtering scale for a given sound speed is smaller than the linear filtering scale by a factor depending on the redshift and the jeans length . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath2% change is common , and our results suggest that , when applied to baryons , the temperature of the inter - galactic medium inferred from the filtering scale observed in the flux power spectrum of lyman-@xmath3 forests would be underestimated by a factor of two , if one used the linear filtering scale to interpret the data </S>",
    "<S> . the filtering mass , which is proportional to the filtering scale cubed , can also be significantly smaller than the linear theory prediction especially at low redshift , where the actual filtering mass can be smaller than the linear prediction by a factor of three . </S>",
    "<S> finally , when applied to neutrinos , we find that neutrino perturbations deviate significantly from linear perturbations even below the free - streaming scales , and thus neutrinos can not be treated as linear perturbations . </S>"
