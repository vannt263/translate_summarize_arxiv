    "recently magnetic coupling of a rotating black hole ( bh ) with its surrounding disk has been investigated by some authors ( blandford 1999 ; li 2000 ; li & paczynski 2000 ; li 2002a , 2002b,2002c , hereafter li02a , li02b and li02c , respectively ; wang , xiao & lei 2002 , hereafter wxl ; wang , lei & ma 2003 , hereafter wlm ) , which can be regarded as one of the variants of the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process proposed two decades ago ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "macdonald and thorne ( 1982 , hereafter mt ) reformulated and extended the bz theory in 3 + 1 split of kerr spacetime . in mt the transportation of energy and angular momentum from a rotating bh to a remote astrophysical load",
    "is not only described by the flow of electromagnetic angular momentum and energy but also by a general relativistic version of dc electronic circuit theory based on a stationary , axisymmetric magnetosphere anchored in the bh and its surrounding disk . in the bz process energy and angular momentum",
    "are extracted from a rotating bh , which is connected with the remote astrophysical load by open magnetic field lines .",
    "unfortunately the remote load has been known very few , resulting in some uncertainty in the bz process .    with the closed magnetic field lines connecting a bh with its surrounding disk",
    "the rotating energy of the bh provides an energy source for disk radiation , and henceforth this energy mechanism is referred to as magnetic coupling ( mc ) process .",
    "the load in mc process is accretion disk , which is much better understood than the remote load in the bz process . since the magnetic field on the bh horizon",
    "is brought and held by the surrounding magnetized disk , the magnetic connection between the bh and the disk is natural and reasonable .",
    "as argued in li02b , the magnetic connection can produce a very steep emissivity compared to the standard accretion , and this result is consistent with the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "considering the astrophysical importance of mc process , we are intended to improve our previous model of mc process given in wxl . based on a reasonable consideration on the configuration of the magnetic field connecting a bh with its surrounding disk",
    "we modify the mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the bh horizon and the radial coordinate on the disk given in wxl ( henceforth mrwxl ) , and derive a condition for the coexistence of the bz and mc processes ( henceforth cebzmc ) .",
    "the transfer of energy and angular momentum in mc process and the profile of the current on the horizon are discussed in detail .",
    "in addition , a very steep emissivity arising from mc process is produced in our model , being in accord with the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 mrwxl is modified based on more reasonable consideration of the magnetic field in bh magnetosphere , and the angular boundary between the open and closed field lines on the horizon is determined naturally by the new mapping relation and the assumption of precedence of the magnetic flux penetrating the disk . the condition for cebzmc",
    "is derived and described in the 2-dimension parameter space consisting of the bh spin and the power law index of the variation of the magnetic field on the disk . in section 3 the transfer direction of energy and angular momentum between the bh and the disk",
    "is described equivalently by the co - rotation radius based on our recent work ( wlm ) and by the flow of electromagnetic angular momentum and redshifted energy given in mt .",
    "in addition , the flux of angular momentum and energy is discussed in detail both above and below the equatorial plane of the bh . in section 4 the profile of electric current flowing on the horizon and the profile of current density from the magnetosphere onto the horizon are discussed based on an equivalent circuit for a unified model of the bz and mc processes proposed in wxl . in section 5 the mc effects on the disk radiation are investigated , and a very steep emissivity is worked out to fit the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation by using the new mapping relation .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we summarize our main results .",
    "although load disk in mc process is much better understood than the remote load in the bz process , a good picture of the magnetic connection between the bh and the disk has not been obtained . in order to facilitate the discussion of the mc effects in an analytic way we make the following assumptions :    \\(i ) assumption : the theory of a stationary , axisymmetric magnetosphere anchored in the bh and its surrounding disk is applicable not only to the bz process but also to mc process .",
    "the magnetosphere is assumed to be force - free outside the bh and the disk .",
    "\\(ii ) assumption : the disk is both stable and perfectly conducting , and the closed magnetic field lines are frozen in the disk .",
    "the disk is thin and keplerian , lies in the equatorial plane of the bh with the inner boundary being at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "\\iii ) assumption : the magnetic field is assumed to be constant on the horizon , and to vary as a power law with the radial coordinate of the disc .",
    "\\iv ) assumption : the magnetic flux connecting a bh with its surrounding disk takes precedence over that connecting the bh with the remote load .    assumption ( iv ) is proposed based on two reasons : ( i ) the magnetic field on the horizon is brought and held by the surrounding magnetized disk .",
    "( ii ) the disk is much nearer to the bh than the remote load .    throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath0 are used .",
    "recently a model of bh evolution was proposed in wxl by considering cebzmc , and the configuration of the poloidal magnetic field is shown in figure 1 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the radii of inner and outer boundary of the mc region , respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath3 indicates the angular boundary between the open and closed field lines on the horizon , and @xmath4 is the lower boundary angle for the closed field lines .",
    "mrwxl was derived based on the conservation of magnetic flux between the horizon and the disk with assumptions ( i ) - ( iii ) .",
    "however there are some inconsistencies with mrwxl as follows :    \\(i ) it is impossible for one closed field line to leave and return the horizon at the same angle @xmath5 on the horizon by the symmetry of the magnetic field above and below the equatorial plane of the bh .",
    "\\(ii ) the boundary condition used in mrwxl says that the normal component of the magnetic field on the horizon is equal to that at the inner edge of the disk , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is not consistent with the estimation given by numerical simulation : the strength of the magnetic field at the horizon is likely greater than that in the disk ( ghosh & abramowicz 1997 and the references therein ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the boundary angle @xmath3 should not be given at random without any reason .",
    "in this paper mrwxl is replaced by a new mapping relation by considering a more reasonable configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "firstly , the angular @xmath4 is assumed less than @xmath7 to avoid inconsistency of the closed field line above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "secondly , we replace the previous boundary condition by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are normal components of magnetic field on the horizon and at the inner edge of the disk , respectively . in writing equation ( 1 )",
    "we have assumed that the two neighboring loops near the inner edge of the disk have the same infinitesimal width , resulting in the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath10 varying from 1.8 to 3 for @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the cylindrical radius at the inner edge of the last stable orbit radius @xmath13 and reads    @xmath14    where the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the bh mass and spin , respectively .",
    "thirdly , as shown later , the boundary angle @xmath17 will be determined naturally by the new mapping relation with assumption ( iv ) rather than given at random .",
    "considering the flux tube consisting of two adjacent magnetic surfaces `` @xmath18 '' and `` @xmath19 '' as shown in figure 1 , we have @xmath20 by continuum of magnetic flux , i.e. ,    @xmath21    where we have @xmath22 .",
    "the concerning kerr metric parameters are given as follows ( mt ) :",
    "so we have    @xmath24    @xmath25    following blandford ( 1976 ) we assume that @xmath26 varies as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is defined as a radial parameter in terms of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the power law index indicating the degree of concentration of the magnetic field in the central region of the disk .",
    "incorporating equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) we have    @xmath31\\xi ^ { - n}.\\ ] ]    substituting equations ( [ eq4])([eq8 ] ) into equation ( [ eq3 ] ) we have    @xmath32    where    @xmath33",
    "integrating equation ( [ eq9 ] ) and setting @xmath34 at @xmath4 , we derive the new mapping relation as follows :    @xmath35    considering that the closed field line connects @xmath17 with @xmath36 , we have    @xmath37    however @xmath38 and @xmath3 can not be determined simultaneously by equation ( [ eq12 ] ) , even if the values of @xmath39 , @xmath30 and @xmath4 are given . to determine the boundary angle @xmath3 , we take assumption ( iv ) , stating that the magnetic flux of the closed field lines takes precedence over that due to the open field lines .",
    "thus we have the curves of @xmath40 and @xmath41 versus @xmath42 with @xmath43 and different values of @xmath30 as shown in figure 2 .    from figure 2",
    "we obtain the following results :    \\(i ) as shown in figure 2a , the parameter @xmath3 remains zero for @xmath11 , provided that the power law index @xmath30 is not so great , such as @xmath44 . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath45 remains finite , varying with @xmath46 non - monotonically and attaining a maximum as @xmath46 approaches unity .",
    "\\(ii ) as shown in figure 2b and 2c , the parameter @xmath3 remains zero for the smaller value of @xmath46 , and becomes positive for the greater value of @xmath46 , provided that @xmath30 is great enough , such as @xmath47 * * , * * @xmath48**. * * in this case the parameter @xmath38 approaches infinite as soon as @xmath3 becomes positive .",
    "the above results arise from the conservation of the magnetic flux and the precedence for the magnetic flux connecting the bh with the disk . in our model the magnetic flux @xmath49 sending out from the bh horizon",
    "should be the sum of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are the fluxes connecting the disk and the remote load , respectively .",
    "the maximum magnetic flux penetrating the disk is defined by    @xmath52    where the upper limit in the integral corresponds to @xmath53 . according to assumption ( iv ) , we have the two possibilities .",
    "\\(1 ) the parameter @xmath40 is finite with @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "\\(2 ) the parameter @xmath40 is infinite with @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "it is easily to check that @xmath60 decreases with the increasing @xmath46 and @xmath30 by using equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath3 occurs with infinite @xmath38 as @xmath46 and @xmath30 are greater than some critical values .",
    "the existence of the positive @xmath61 is just the condition for cebzmc , which can be expressed more clearly by the contours of @xmath3 in @xmath62 parameter space as shown in figure 3 .    in figure 3 the value of @xmath3",
    "is labeled beside each contour , increasing along the direction from left - bottom to right - top , and the thick solid line labeled zero is the critical contour with @xmath63 . thus the parameter space is divided by the critical contour into two parts : ( i ) the right - top part for cebzmc , and ( ii ) the left - bottom part for mc process only .",
    "the following conclusions can be obtained from figure 3 :    \\(i ) the state of cebzmc depends on both the bh spin @xmath46 and the index @xmath30 , and it occurs only if @xmath46 and @xmath30 are great enough to fall in the right - top part of the parameter space ;    \\(ii ) the greater is @xmath46 , the less is @xmath30 for the given value of @xmath3 .",
    "the greater are @xmath46 and @xmath30 , the greater is @xmath3 for the given value of the lower boundary angle @xmath4 ;    \\(iii ) the greater is @xmath4 , the greater is the part for cebzmc in the parameter space .",
    "the requirement of cebzmc for a greater @xmath30 implies that the magnetic field is more concentrated in the central region of the disk by equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , although we might have @xmath38 approach infinity in this case .",
    "since the load disk in mc process is much better understood than the remote load in the bz process , we can obtain a better picture of the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the bh and the disk . in this section",
    "we are going to give two equivalent descriptions on the transfer of energy and angular momentum in mc process .      in wlm",
    "the transfer direction of energy and angular momentum in mc process is discussed in detail in terms of co - rotation radius @xmath64 , and it is defined as the radius on the disk , where the angular velocity of the disk , @xmath65 , is equal to the angular velocity of the bh , @xmath66 .",
    "the radius @xmath64 can be determined from the following equation :    @xmath67^ { - 1 } = 1,\\ ] ]    and is expressed by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is a function of @xmath46 .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 decreases monotonically with @xmath71 as shown by the dot - dashed line in figure 4 . by using equation ( [ eq12 ] ) with assumption ( iv )",
    "we have the curves of @xmath45 versus @xmath46 for different values of the index @xmath30 as shown also in figure 4 .",
    "it is found that the mc region is divided into two parts by @xmath72 : the inner mc region ( henceforth imcr ) for @xmath73 and the outer mc region ( henceforth omcr ) for @xmath74 .",
    "therefore energy and angular momentum are always transferred by the closed magnetic field lines from the bh to the disk in omcr with @xmath75 , while the transfer direction reverses in imcr with @xmath76 .",
    "the correlation of the bh spin with the transfer direction is given as follows :    \\(i ) for @xmath77 we have @xmath70 within the inner edge , and the mc region is all in omcr with the transfer direction from bh to disk .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath78 we have @xmath79 , and the transfer is bi - directional , i.e. it is either from bh to omcr or from imcr to bh .",
    "\\(iii ) for @xmath80 we have @xmath81 , and the mc region is all in imcr with the transfer direction from disk to bh .      in mt",
    "the poloidal components of the flow of electromagnetic angular momentum and redshifted energy in the magnetosphere are expressed as follows :    @xmath82    @xmath83    where @xmath84 in equation ( [ eq16 ] ) is the current flowing downward through an * _ m_*-loop , which is related to the toroidal magnetic field @xmath85 by ampere s law :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is a toroidal killing vector as given in mt .",
    "the two terms on rhs of equation ( [ eq18 ] ) are expressed by    @xmath88    where @xmath89 in equation ( [ eq19 ] ) is the poloidal electric field and satisfies    @xmath90    in absolute - space formulation for the bz process all the laws of physics are expressed in terms of physical quantities measured by `` zero - angular - momentum observers '' ( zamos ) ( bardeen , press & teukolsky , 1972 ) , and zamo angular velocity @xmath91 is expressed by    @xmath92    in equation ( [ eq20 ] ) velocity @xmath93 of the magnetic field line relative to zamo is expressed as    @xmath94    incorporating equations ( [ eq17])([eq22 ] ) , we have the expression for @xmath95 as follows :    @xmath96    according to assumption ( i ) equations ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) are also applicable to mc process . inspecting equations ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] )",
    "we have the following results .",
    "\\(i ) there is neither angular momentum flow nor energy flow at all unless poloidal currents are presented @xmath97 .",
    "\\(ii ) both angular momentum flow and energy flow along the magnetic field lines away from the bh to the disk if the current @xmath84 flows downwards through an * _ m_*-loop , i.e. , @xmath98 , while the direction of the two will be reversed , if the current @xmath84 flows upwards through an * _ m_*-loop , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "if the description by @xmath100 and @xmath101 is in accord with that by co - rotation radius @xmath64 , the sign of the current @xmath84 should be dependent on whether the radius @xmath102 is outside or inside @xmath64 .",
    "we shall discuss the sign of the current @xmath84 by using the equivalent circuit in a unified model for the bz and mc processes given in wxl as shown in figure 5 , which is adapted to the configuration of the magnetic field in figure 1 .",
    "in the i - loop of figure 5 segments @xmath103 ( characterized by the flux @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( characterized by the flux @xmath106 represent two adjacent magnetic surfaces , and segments @xmath107 and @xmath108 represent the bh horizon and the load sandwiched by these two surfaces . @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the corresponding resistance of the bh horizon and the load , respectively . @xmath111 and @xmath112 are electromotive forces due to the rotation of the bh and the load , respectively .",
    "the minus sign in the expression of @xmath113 arises from the direction of the flux .",
    "the current in each loop is expressed as    @xmath114    suppose that an * _ m_*-loop is embedded the magnetic surface qr . inspecting figures 1 with 5 , we find that the current @xmath84 flowing downwards through the * _ m_*-loop is simply @xmath115 , i.e. ,    @xmath116    suppose that the magnetic surface qr intersects with the disk at the co - rotation radius @xmath64 , we have @xmath117 at @xmath118 . henceforth the magnetic surface qr is referred to as co - rotation magnetic surface ( crms ) .",
    "incorporating figures 1 and 5 and equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) , we conclude the following results :    \\(i ) the magnetic surface inside crms penetrates omcr with @xmath119 and @xmath98 .",
    "thus @xmath120 and @xmath101 are in the same direction as @xmath121 , i.e. , both angular momentum and energy are transferred from the bh to disk .",
    "\\(ii ) the magnetic surface outside crms penetrates imcr with @xmath122 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus @xmath120 and @xmath101 are opposite to @xmath123 , i.e. , both angular momentum and energy are transferred from the disk to the bh .",
    "thus we have shown that the two descriptions for transfer of angular momentum and energy in mc process are equivalent .",
    "we can also prove that the two descriptions are equivalent both above and below the equatorial plane of the bh by considering the following points .",
    "\\(i ) direction of @xmath124 above and below the equatorial plane of the bh ;    \\(ii ) rotation of the bh with respect to the magnetic field lines frozen in the disk ;    \\(iii ) dragging effect of the rotating bh on the magnetic field lines ;    \\(iv ) equation ( [ eq18 ] ) relating the direction of @xmath85 and the sign of the current @xmath84 through an * _ m_*-loop ( downwards or upwards ) .",
    "we can determine the direction of @xmath85 by points ( ii ) and ( iii ) , and determine the sign of @xmath84 by point ( iv ) . combining the above points with the symmetry above and below the equatorial plane , we summarize the direction of @xmath100 and @xmath125 as shown in table 1 .",
    "it is shown in table 1 the direction of @xmath100 and @xmath101 depends only on the place where the field line penetrates the disk ( in omcr or imcr ) , and the two descriptions are equivalent both above and below the equatorial plane of the bh .      from equation ( [ eq17 ] ) we find that @xmath101 consists of two terms , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where the latter has the same direction as @xmath100 , and the former is related to the directions of @xmath89 and @xmath85 .",

    "unfortunately , the derivation of equation ( [ eq35 ] ) was not given in li02a and li02b , which should be related to the torque exerted on the bh in mc process .",
    "in wxl the torque exerted on the bh is expressed by    @xmath194    where    @xmath195    and @xmath196 is the bh mass in the unit of @xmath197 .",
    "the flux @xmath187 can be derived from @xmath198 by the conservation of angular momentum as follows :    @xmath199    where @xmath200 is related to the new mapping relation ( [ eq11 ] ) by    @xmath201    incorporating equations ( [ eq39 ] ) and ( [ eq40 ] ) , we have    @xmath202    where @xmath203 , and    @xmath204}f_a \\left ( { a _ * , \\xi } \\right ) \\\\",
    "\\\\   f_a \\left ( { a _ * , \\xi } \\right ) = \\frac{\\sqrt { 1 + a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 4 } \\xi ^ { - 2 } + 2a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 6 } \\xi ^ { - 3 } } } { \\sqrt { \\left ( { 1 + a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 4 } + 2a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 6 } } \\right)\\left ( { 1 - 2\\chi _ { ms}^ { - 2 } \\xi ^ { - 1 } + a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 4 } \\xi ^ { - 2 } } \\right ) } } \\\\   \\end{array } } \\right.\\ ] ]    thus we derive the expression ( [ eq41 ] ) for the function @xmath187 , where @xmath205 , and the coefficient @xmath206 is dependent on @xmath46 and @xmath207 rather than a constant given in equation ( [ eq35 ] ) .    incorporating equations ( [ eq34 ] ) , ( [ eq36 ] ) and ( [ eq41 ] ) , we have the curves of the emissivity index @xmath208 versus @xmath209 for the different values of @xmath4 and @xmath30 in figure 8 .",
    "as shown in the shaded region of figure 8 , we find that the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 can be simulated by the new mapping relation ( [ eq11 ] ) with three parameters : ( i ) the bh spin @xmath46 , ( ii ) the power law index @xmath30 , and ( iii ) the lower boundary angle @xmath4 . while the index produced by a standard accretion disc ( sad ) is far below the shaded region as shown by the solid lines in figure 8 .",
    "more parameters suitable to the observation are listed in table 3 , from which we find that the condition for cebzmc is well satisfied by these values of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath30 . according to the condition for cebzmc derived in our model we expect that an jet might be produced nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by the bz process accompanying with mc process .",
    "in this paper the mc effects are discussed based on a stationary , axisymmetric magnetosphere anchored in the bh and its surrounding disk . since we know very few about the magnetic field connecting bh with disk , the discussion is based on some simplified assumptions .",
    "it is known that electromagnetic field is related to electric charge density and current density in bh magnetosphere by a stream equation containing the stream function proposed in mt .",
    "unfortunately it is a rather complicated task to solve analytically the ` stream equation ' with the boundary conditions at horizon and disk surface .",
    "recently the magnetic connection of a kerr bh with disk and the resulting transportation of energy and angular momentum are discussed analytically based on a toy model in li02c , where the poloidal magnetic field connecting the bh with the disk is naturally produced by a single toroidal current flowing around the bh in the equatorial plane .",
    "although the existence of the single toroidal current needs further explanation , it is a step towards the goal of the origin of the magnetic connection .",
    "although the configuration of the magnetic field in li02c is different from that described in our model , the very steep emissivities in the disk are produced in both models .",
    "so we think that the very steep emissivities can be regarded as the main feature of the magnetic connection between the bh and the disk .",
    "the main results of our model are summarized as follows .",
    "( i ) a consistent picture about the configuration of the magnetic field is depicted by figure 1 with the equivalent circuit in figure 5 , and the transfer of energy and angular momentum along the closed field lines in mc process is described clearly and virtually in the two equivalent descriptions .",
    "( ii ) the condition for cebzmc is derived naturally based on some reasonable assumptions , which might be helpful in explaining the high energy radiation from bh - disk systems by combining the two mechanisms .",
    "( iii ) the profile of the current on the horizon is calculated , and its continuity at the boundary angle is discussed based on the equivalent circuit .",
    "( iv ) the mc effects on the disk radiation and the emissivity index are investigated , and the results turn out to be in accord with the observation .    in our model the most important parameters of the system",
    "are the bh spin @xmath42 and the power law index @xmath30 .",
    "the importance of bh spin @xmath42 rests in the two aspects : ( i ) the ratio of the rotating energy to the total energy of a kerr bh is a function of @xmath42 , and it increases monotonically with the increasing @xmath42 ( wald 1984 ) .",
    "( ii ) the extracting powers in the bz and mc processes are all proportional to @xmath210 ( wxl ) .",
    "the power law index @xmath30 plays an important role in adjusting the profile of the magnetic field in the two aspects : ( i ) the more is the value of @xmath30 , the more is the magnetic field concentrated in the central region of the disk ; ( ii ) the more is the value of @xmath30 , the less is the maximum magnetic flux penetrating the disk , and the more is the boundary angle @xmath211 , and the more is the bz power due to the effects of the open field lines on the horizon .    in this paper",
    ", we fail to discuss the mc effects on disk accretion rate by the following consideration : the variation of disk accretion rate due to the transfer of angular momentum is probably a dynamical process rather than a stationary one , which is much more complicated than the case we discuss in this paper .",
    "we shall discuss the mc effects on accretion rate in the future work .",
