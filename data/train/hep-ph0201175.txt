    "the strange content of the nucleon is under particular attention by the high energy physics society recently .",
    "ji and tang@xcite suggested that if a small locality of strange sea in nucleon is confirmed , some phenomenological consequences can be resulted in .",
    "the ccfr data@xcite indicate that @xmath2 .",
    "assuming an asymmetry between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , ji and tang analyzed the ccfr data and concluded that @xmath5 mev and @xmath6 mev@xcite .",
    "so if only considering the central values , @xmath7 mev . in the framework of the standard model @xmath8 , we would like to look for some possible mechanisms which can induce the asymmetry .",
    "the self - energy of strange quark and antiquark @xmath9 occurs via loops where various interactions contribute to @xmath10 through the effective vertices .",
    "obviously , the qcd interaction can not distinguish between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , neither the weak interaction alone in fact .",
    "practical calculation of the self - energy also shows that @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , because of the cpt theorem , @xmath3 and @xmath4 must be of exactly the same mass .    if we evaluate the self - energy @xmath12 and @xmath13 in vacuum , the cpt theorem demands @xmath14",
    ". however , when we evaluate them in an asymmetric environment of nucleons , an asymmetry @xmath15 where the superscript @xmath16 denotes the medium effects , can be expected . in other words",
    ", we suggest that the asymmetry of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quark composition in nucleons leads to an asymmetry of the strange sea .",
    "there exist both short - distance and long - distance medium effects .",
    "the short - distance effects occur at quark - gauge boson level , namely a self - energy loop including a quark - fermion line and a w - boson line or a tadpole loop .",
    "the contributions of @xmath17 and @xmath18-types of quark - antiquark to the asymmetry realize through the kabayashi - maskawa - cabibbo mixing .",
    "the calculations at the parton-@xmath19 level is trustworthy , because it is carried out in the standard framework which has been proved to be correct .",
    "one does not suspect its validity and trusts that this mechanism can cause an asymmetry of the strange sea in nucleons .",
    "however , later we will show that it can only result in a @xmath20 of order of a few kev , much below what we need for phenomenology .    accepting the value of @xmath20 achieved by fitting data as about 40 mev",
    ", one has to look for other mechanisms which can bring up larger @xmath20 .",
    "obviously the smallness of @xmath20 is due to the heavy @xmath21 or @xmath22 bosons in the propagators .",
    "and they are responsible for the weak interaction .",
    "we would ask if the strong interaction can get involved , if yes , it definitely enhances the @xmath20 by orders .",
    "however , the parton - gluon interaction can not lead to the asymmetry , because gluon is flavor - blind .",
    "thus the perturbative qcd where gluons are exchanged between partons does not apply in this case .",
    "a natural extension would be that the long - distance interaction may result in a larger asymmetry .",
    "it is generally believed that the long - distance effects exist at the quark level , but the realm is fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd , so the question is how to evaluate the long - distance effects .",
    "in fact , brodsky and one of us proposed a meson - baryon resonance mechanism and they suggested that the sea quark - antiquark asymmetries are generated by a light - cone model of energetically favored meson - baryon fluctuations@xcite .",
    "we try to re - evaluate the asymmetry from another angle , namely , we consider the interaction of quark(parton)-meson . here",
    "there is a principal problem that the parton picture was introduced for high energy processes where partons are treated massless compared to the involved energy scale .",
    "that is an self - consistent picture where the chiral symmetry is respected .",
    "can the picture enclose the quark - meson interaction is still a puzzle .",
    "but as the phenomenology suggests , the long - distance strong interaction should apply in this case , there can be possibility to treat the quark - meson interaction as for the constituent - quark - meson interaction , even though at this energy scale ( the invariant masses of the mesons ) the chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "there is another reason to believe the picture that the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath23 , @xmath24 etc .",
    "are composite of su(3 ) quarks and antiquarks , but also are the goldstine bosons , so they must satisfy the bethe - salpeter equation and the dyson - schwinger equation simultaneously . the picture may become self - consistent when the non - perturbative qcd effects can be properly regarded . at this stage",
    "we just postulate that we can apply the chiral lagrangian to treat the quark - meson interaction where the sea quark(antiquark ) and valence quarks are all included .",
    "many authors employed this scenario to estimate various flavor asymmetries and spin contents@xcite , where the sea quarks(antiquarks ) make substantial contributions . however , in ref .  4 ,",
    "the constituent quark mass of 340 mev was employed , whereas , in ref .  5 , the current quark mass relation @xmath25 is used where @xmath26 is the mass of the light quarks ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "this discrepancy still comes from lack of solid knowledge on the non - perturbative qcd . in our work",
    ", we vary the quark masses and see how the numerical values change .",
    "our results indicate that the difference for various quark masses is not too remarkable .    for the valence and sea quark picture",
    ", one has to use the quark distribution function which has obvious statistical meaning .",
    "here instead of the commonly used distribution function , we adopt the distribution with finite medium temperature and density .",
    "the temperature involved in the distribution is only a parameter which characterizes the inner motion state of the quarks ( valence and sea ) and has the order of @xmath27 . in practice , we let the temperature vary within a reasonable range @xmath28 mev .",
    "the advantage of using the finite temperature field theory is obvious .",
    "first , the theory is well - established and then the calculations are simple and straightforward .",
    "we are going to employ the familiar formulation of the quantum field theory at finite temperature and density . as well - known , the thermal propagator of quarks can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the four - vector for the medium and @xmath31 denotes the fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the chemical potential .",
    "we notice that the first term of eq .",
    "( [ pro ] ) is just the quark propagator in the vacuum .",
    "its contribution to @xmath35 is of no importance to us because this is related to the wave - function renormalization of the quark in the vacuum .",
    "we focus on the medium effect , which comes from the second term of eq .",
    "( [ pro ] ) . for up and down flavors",
    ", we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 in proton while @xmath38 and @xmath39 in neutron .    for the short - distance contribution ,",
    "the two contributions to the self - energy of @xmath3-quark ( @xmath4 ) ( a ) and ( b ) are due to the charged current ( @xmath40 ) and neutral current respectively , the later is usually called as the tadpole - diagram@xcite .",
    "the contribution due to the charged current is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath43 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "the contribution due to the weak neutral current is @xmath44 where @xmath45 refers to the charge of corresponding quark ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "pal and pham pointed that the axial part of the neutral current does not contribute@xcite .",
    "for the long - distance effects , in the calculations , we need an effective vertex for @xmath46 where @xmath47 can be either @xmath17 or @xmath18-quarks and @xmath16 is a pseudoscalar or vector meson . here",
    "we only retain the lowest lying meson states such as @xmath48 etc .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian for the interaction between quarks and mesons has been derived by many authors@xcite .    in terms of these effective vertices ,",
    "the long - distance medium correction to the mass of strange quark can be evaluated and we obtain @xmath49.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to avoid the pole in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , we use the familiar breit - wigner formulation .      according to the picture of chiral field",
    "theory@xcite , the effective pseudovector coupling implies @xmath53 , where the axial - vector coupling @xmath54 .",
    "the pion decay constant @xmath55 mev , kaon decay constant @xmath56 mev , for our estimation , an approximate su(3 ) symmetry might be valid , so that @xmath57 can be taken as an average of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath60 mev .",
    "one can trust that the order of the effective coupling at the vertices does not deviate too much from this value .",
    "more detailed analysis can be found in ref .  10 . as a summary , we find that an asymmetry of the light quarks in nucleons can induce the expected asymmetry of the strange sea .",
    "the short - distance effects are caused by the fundamental weak interactions of the standard model , so that the corresponding theoretical estimation of the asymmetry is more reliable , but due to the heavy w(z ) bosons in the propagators , such effects can only result in @xmath20 of a few kev .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath20 must come from the long - distance strong interaction , if the phenomenological value of @xmath20 is about 40 mev as determined by data .",
    "how to correctly evaluate such effects is the key point , even though one can be convinced that the long - distance effects should make a substantial contribution to @xmath20 .    in the history ,",
    "there has been a dispute whether the parton picture and the quark - meson interaction compromise with each other , and if they do coincide , how to properly apply the picture to evaluate phenomenological quantities is still an open problem . in this work ,",
    "we just calculate the asymmetry of the strange sea by this picture and obtain an estimate which meets the value range from data fitting .",
    "therefore we may consider that this scenario has certain plausibility and its applicability should be further tested in other calculations .",
    "the studies along this line are worth more attention , because it is of obvious significance for theory and phenomenological applications .",
