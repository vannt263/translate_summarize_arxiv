    "after the discovery of fractional quantum hall effect,@xcite , we realized that new kind of orders beyond landau s symmetry breaking paradigm is possible .",
    "this new kind order is called topological order @xcite for gapped states and quantum order@xcite for general states .",
    "the new orders reflect patterns of long range entanglements in the ground state .    gapped @xmath0 spin liquids have the simplest kind of topological order ",
    "@xmath0 topological order.@xcite those topological ordered states may appear in frustrated spin systems or dimmer models.@xcite physically , the topological orders can be ( partially ) characterized by robust ground - state degeneracy.@xcite the low energy effective theory for those @xmath0 topologically ordered states is a @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "topological order is a property of a many - body ground state that is robust against any perturbations , even those perturbations that break all the symmetries . in this paper , we like to study the interplay between topological order and symmetry .",
    "we like to find out how to characterize topological ordered states that also have certain symmetries .",
    "recently , it was found that for spin liquids with all the lattice symmetries ( such as lattice translation and rotation symmetry ) , there can be hundreds different @xmath0 topological orders.@xcite we will call those topological orders symmetric topological orders .",
    "it is shown that the different symmetric @xmath0 topological orders can be characterized by different project symmetry groups ( psg ) .",
    "so those symmetric topological orders are good examples to study the relation between topological order and symmetry .    here",
    ", we would like to study the low energy effective theories for those different @xmath0 topological orders and ask how different symmetric @xmath0 topological orders are reflected in low energy effective theories .",
    "we find that all different @xmath0 topological orders can be described by the same effective mutual @xmath1 chern - simons ( cs ) theories.@xcite the lattice symmetry is realized projectively in the effective mutual cs theories .",
    "it turns out that different symmetric @xmath0 topological orders have different projective realizations of the lattice symmetries . to confirm our results , the projective construction ( the slave - particle theory ) @xcite",
    "is used to calculate the ground - state degeneracies , the ground - state quantum numbers , and the psgs of quasi - particles .",
    "those results agree with those obtained from the effective mutual cs theories .",
    "furthermore , we also used the effective mutual cs theories to study gapless edge states for some @xmath0 topologically ordered states .",
    "the key to understand topological orders is to construct states that can have long range quantum entanglements .",
    "the projective construction introduced in the study of high @xmath2 superconductors is a powerful way to construct such states.@xcite in this section , we will briefly review the projective construction of @xmath0 topologically ordered states .",
    "a spin-1/2 model can be viewed as a hard - core - boson model , if we identify @xmath3 state as a zero - boson state @xmath4 and @xmath5 state as a one - boson state @xmath6 . in the follow",
    "we will use the boson - picture to describe our model .",
    "we first introduce a `` mean - field '' fermion hamiltonian:@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "we will use @xmath9 and @xmath10 to denote the @xmath11 complex matrices whose elements are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the ground state of the above free fermion hamiltonian ( the lowest energy state obtained by filling all the negative energy levels ) .",
    "then a many - boson wave function can be obtained through @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , label the location of bosons ( up - spins ) . here",
    ", we have assumed that there are @xmath21 up - spins and @xmath22 down - spins .",
    "we may view @xmath23 as variational parameters and the physical spin wave function @xmath24 as a trial wave function .",
    "the trial ground state of a spin hamiltonian can be obtained by minimizing the average energy @xmath25 .",
    "first let us consider the following spin hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the pauli matrices and @xmath28 labels the site of a square lattice .",
    "we find that if we choose the variational parameters to be @xmath29 then the spin wave function minimize the average energy .",
    "in fact the wave function is the exact ground state of hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite it was found that all the excitations above the ground state are gapped and the ground state contains a non - trivial topological order described by a @xmath0 effective gauge theory .",
    "we will call such a state z2e state .    ref .",
    "introduced another many - spin state on square lattice which is described by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , it is not clear what kind of spin hamiltonian gives rise to the spin state described by the above variational parameters . despite of this",
    ", some physical properties of the spin state were obtained under the assumptions that the state is stable for a certain local spin hamiltonian.@xcite again , all excitations above the spin state have finite energy gaps .",
    "the spin state is a spin liquid with no spin order .",
    "but it contains a non - trivial topological order described by an effective @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "so we will call such a spin state z2a state .",
    "naively , one may expect the z2a and the z2e states to be the same state since both have @xmath0 gauge theory as their low energy effective theory . in the following",
    ", we will show that they are different quantum states with different topological orders .",
    "line and the @xmath33 line get an additional minus sign . ]",
    "one way to study a topological order is to study its ground state degeneracy on a torus .",
    "naively , we expect the z2a and the z2e state to have 4 degenerate ground states , as implied by the effective @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "the argument goes as the following .",
    "first , we note that the physical boson wave function @xmath34 is invariant under the following @xmath35 gauge transformations@xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "so the average energy @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39    next we assume @xmath40 give rise to a ( variational ) ground state of a hamiltonian .",
    "we would like to show that the following four ansatz @xmath41 produce four degenerate ground states . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 have values @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 if the link @xmath48 crosses the @xmath49 line ( see fig .  [ xyline ] ) and @xmath50 otherwise . similarly , @xmath51 if the link @xmath48 crosses the @xmath33 line and @xmath52 otherwise .",
    "physically , the degenerate states arise from adding @xmath53 flux through the two holes of the torus .",
    "the values of @xmath42 reflect the presence or the absence of the @xmath53 flux in the two holes .",
    "we note that @xmath54 represents the ground state .",
    "we also note that @xmath55 with different @xmath56 and @xmath57 are _ locally _ gauge equivalent .",
    "this is because , on an infinite system , the change , say , @xmath58 can be generated by an @xmath35 gauge transformation @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 if @xmath64 . as a result , @xmath65 . on the other hand , on a torus , @xmath66 with different @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "are not gauge equivalent in the global sense .",
    "there is no @xmath35 gauge transformation defined on the torus that connects those ansatz .",
    "so the four ansatz give rise to four different degenerate states .",
    "this is how we obtain the four - fold ground state degeneracy for the @xmath0 states .",
    "however , the above argument is valid only for even by even lattice . for odd by odd lattice ,",
    "the argument breaks down . to understand the failure of the above argument , let us construct the mean - field ground state more carefully .",
    "let us start with a simple case of the z2a state .",
    "for the ansatz , the `` mean - field '' hamiltonian in momentum space becomes    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69    here @xmath70 and @xmath71 are diagonalized quasiparticles operators @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the functions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 the mean - field ground state is obtained by filling all the negative levels and is given by @xmath77 where the state @xmath78 is defined through @xmath79 .",
    "( note that all the particles @xmath70 has positive energy and all the particles @xmath71 has negative energy . )",
    "since @xmath80 is linear combination of @xmath81 and @xmath82 and there are @xmath83 different @xmath84-levels , the mean - field state @xmath85 contains @xmath83 number of fermions . here",
    "@xmath86 are sizes of the lattice in the @xmath87- and @xmath33-directions .",
    "clearly , when both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are odd , @xmath85 contains an odd number of fermions .",
    "such a mean - field state does not correspond to any physical spin state since the corresponding spin wave function vanishes .",
    "( note that is a projection to the subspace with 0 or 2 fermions per site . ) to get a non - zero physical spin wave function we need to start with a mean - field state with one extra fermion in the empty @xmath90-band ( or a hole in the filled @xmath91-band ) .",
    "but by choosing different states for the extra fermion ( or the hole ) , we can obtain many different spin wave functions which are nearly degenerate .",
    "so when both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are odd , the excitations in the z2a state are gapless , or we may say that the z2a state has infinite degeneracy .",
    "physically , the z2a state on odd by odd lattice always contains a unpaired spinon .",
    "the different states of the unpaired spinon gives rise to the infinite degeneracy .",
    "when one of @xmath86 is even , the mean - field state @xmath92 gives rise to a non - zero physical spin state .",
    "there is no unpaired spinon and the excitations are gaped .",
    "each ansatz @xmath93 produces a single physical spin state and the z2a state has four - fold degeneracy on a torus with an even number of lattice sites .",
    "because the spin hamiltonian is translation invariant , the ground states carry definite crystal momentum .",
    "to calculate the crystal momentum , we note that in the @xmath94 sector described by the ansatz @xmath95 , the fermion wave function satisfies the periodic boundary condition .",
    "so @xmath96 are quantized as @xmath97 where @xmath98 are integers . and the spin state produced by the ansatz @xmath95 has the following crystal momentum : @xmath99 we would like to point out that the above crystal momentum is actually the crystal momentum of the mean - field state .",
    "however , the even - fermion - per - site projection commutes with the translation operator , and thus the crystal momentum is unchanged by projection .    when @xmath56 and/or @xmath57 are equal to 1 , the fermion wave function is antiperiodic in the @xmath33- and/or @xmath87-directions . in the case , @xmath100 and/or @xmath101 are quantized as @xmath102 and/or @xmath103 .",
    "the crystal momentum of the spin state produce by the ansatz @xmath93 can be calculated in the similar fashion .",
    "for example in the @xmath104 sector , the crystal momentum is given by @xmath105 the results are summarized in the table [ z2acm ] .",
    ".crystal momenta @xmath106 of the four ground states , @xmath107= ( 0,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) , of the z2a spin liquid on three different lattices , @xmath108 ( even , even ) , ( even , odd ) , ( odd , even ) .",

    "in the above sections we have calculated the topological properties for the z2a and the z2e states . due to their different topological properties , we find that the two states have different topological orders .",
    "then an important issue is to find the low energy effective theories that describe the two different topological orders .",
    "we find that a mutual @xmath110 cs theory with different projective realizations of the lattice symmetry can describe the two kind of topological orders .",
    "we reach the conclusion by comparing the topological properties of the mutual @xmath109 cs theory with those of the z2a and the z2e states .",
    "all the topological properties , including topological degeneracy , quantum numbers , and edge states , agree , indicating the equivalence between the @xmath0 topological states on lattice and the mutual @xmath109 cs theory .",
    "first we introduce the lagrangian for the mutual @xmath109 cs theory : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the gauge field strength for gauge field @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the gauge field strength for gauge field @xmath115 .",
    "the excitations are described by the currents which are defined as @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the gauge charges of @xmath118 and @xmath119 are quantized as integers .    from the equation motions for @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    "@xmath122 we find that a charge for gauge field @xmath123 induces flux of gauge field @xmath124 . as a result ,",
    "the charge for gauge field @xmath125 and the charge for gauge field @xmath124 have a semionic mutual statistics .",
    "that is , moving an @xmath123-charge around an @xmath126-charge generates a phase @xmath53 .",
    "this catches the key topological property for the @xmath0 spin liquid .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0 spin liquid states contain @xmath0 vortex and @xmath0 charge excitations .",
    "and the @xmath127 vortex and the @xmath0 charge have semionic mutual statistics between them .",
    "so we will propose that the mutual chern - simons theory [ mcsl ] describes a @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "the @xmath123-charge can be identified as the @xmath0 charge and the @xmath124-charge as the @xmath0 vortex .",
    "furthermore , the energy gap for both of the gauge fields comes from the mutual cs term @xmath128 the mutual @xmath109 cs theory describes a gapped topological state .",
    "this also agrees with the @xmath129 topological states where all excitations are gapped .    however , we have two kinds of @xmath0 topological orders z2a and z2e",
    ". how can the two different @xmath0 topological orders be described by the same @xmath109 cs theory ? in the following",
    "we will show that two different @xmath0 topological orders are described by the same @xmath109 cs theory but with different realizations of the lattice symmetry .    to obtain two different realizations of lattice symmetry",
    ", we note that @xmath0 vortices for the exactly soluble model ( the z2e state ) live on the even plaquettes .",
    "the vortices on the odd plaquettes are actually the @xmath0 charge.@xcite so under a translation by one lattice spacing , a @xmath0 vortex is changed into a @xmath0 charge !",
    "so in the mutual @xmath109 cs theory that describes the z2e state , @xmath124 and @xmath130 must exchange under the translation by one lattice spacing .    also , the z2a state contains @xmath131 flux through each square .",
    "this @xmath131 flux also affects how @xmath118 is transformed under translation . to see this ,",
    "let us consider two wilson loop operators @xmath132 and @xmath133 along two loops @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "both loops wrap around the torus in @xmath33-direction .",
    "however the loop @xmath135 is displaced from the loop @xmath134 by one lattice constant in the @xmath87-direction . in the following , we will assume the lattice constant is @xmath136 .",
    "due to the @xmath131 flux through each square , we see that @xmath137 , where @xmath89 is the length of the torus in the @xmath33-direction .",
    "so under a translation by one lattice constant in the @xmath87-direction , @xmath138 must change to @xmath139 , to account for the change in the wilson loop .",
    "the above discussion motivates us to define two types of mutual @xmath109 cs theories which have different realizations of translation symmetries .",
    "let @xmath140 and @xmath141 be the translations by one lattice spacing in the @xmath87 and @xmath33 directions respectively .",
    "the first type of the mutual @xmath109 cs theory is denoted as z2a type which describes the z2a state .",
    "the @xmath131 flux makes the gauge fields transform non - trivially under translations : @xmath142 since the translation @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) may shift @xmath145 ( @xmath146 by @xmath53 , this reproduces the different patterns of crystal momenta of the degenerate ground states on different lattices .    the other type of the mutual cs theory is denoted as z2e type that describes the z2e state .",
    "it has no flux .",
    "however , the gauge fields still transform non - trivially under translations : @xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 will exchange under a translation operation by one lattice spacing .      in the next a few sections",
    ", we will calculate the topological properties of the above two types of mutual cs theory .",
    "first , we calculate the topological degeneracy for the ground states . in the temporal gauge , @xmath150 and on an even - by - even lattice ,",
    "the fluctuations @xmath148 and @xmath149 are periodic .",
    "we can expand them as @xmath151 where @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath98 are integers .",
    "@xmath154 and @xmath155 are the gauge fields with non - zero momentum and @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the zero modes with zero momentum for the gauge fields @xmath130 and @xmath158 . because the existence of the mass gap , the degree freedoms for gauge fields with non - zero momentum @xmath159and @xmath160 have nothing to do with the low energy physics .",
    "it is the degree freedoms of zero momentum @xmath156 and @xmath157 that determine the low energy physics .",
    "the effective lagrangian eq.([mcs ] ) determines the dynamics of @xmath161 and @xmath162 which corresponds to two particles on a plane with a finite magnetic field .",
    "@xmath163 are the coordinates of the first particle , and @xmath164 are the coordinates of the second particle .",
    "thus we map the original mutual @xmath109 cs theory to a quantum mechanics model of two particles ( see appendix ) .",
    "the energy spectrum for the quantum mechanics model can be solved easily .",
    "the lowest energy levels for above model reveal the topological characters for the ground states .",
    "the degeneracy for @xmath163 degrees of freedom and the degeneracy for @xmath165 degrees of freedom are given as @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "for both the z2a type and the z2e type cs theories , there exist four degenerate ground states @xmath168 however , the above result only applies to even - by - even lattice .",
    "for other cases , even - by - odd , odd - by - even and odd - by - odd , the situations are changed .",
    "we will discuss those more complicated cases in appendix .. we find that for the z2a type mutual cs theory , the ground state degeneracy remain to be @xmath169 for even - by - odd and odd - by - even lattices . for the z2e type mutual cs theory ,",
    "the ground state degeneracy becomes @xmath170 for even - by - odd , odd - by - even , and odd - by - odd lattices .",
    "one way to understand the later result is to note that if @xmath88 is odd then one gauge field will turn into the other one as we go around the lattice along @xmath87-direction .",
    "thus the gauge fields have a twisted boundary condition : @xmath171 this twisted boundary condition means that @xmath115 and @xmath172 can be viewed as a single gauge field on a lattice whose size is doubled in the @xmath87-direction .",
    "there are only two zero modes in the mode expansion . as a result",
    "the ground - state degeneracy on even - by - odd , odd - by - even and odd - by - odd is reduced to @xmath170 .",
    "we can also use the cs theories to calculate the crystal momenta of the ground states ( see appendix ) .",
    "the results agree with those in tables [ z2acm ] and [ z2ecm ] .",
    "we can also use the mutual @xmath109 cs theories to study edge excitations .",
    "first , let us consider the exact soluble model ( [ hexct ] ) on a finite @xmath83 lattice with a periodic boundary condition only along @xmath33-direction .",
    "the lattice has two edges along @xmath33 -direction located at @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "such a lattice model can be obtained from the periodic lattice model ( [ hexct ] ) by setting @xmath175 for a column of plaquettes .",
    "the resulting model is still exactly soluble .",
    "we find that the ground states have @xmath176-fold degeneracy which arise from @xmath177 on the column of plaquettes with @xmath175 .",
    "those degenerate states can be viewed as gapless edge excitations on the two boundaries .",
    "since there are @xmath178 edge sites , we find that there are @xmath179 edge states per edge site , indicating that the gapless edge states are described by majorana fermions . indeed , the gapless edge excitations can be mapped to a majorana fermion system exactly . to obtain the gapless edge states from the mutual cs theories , we introduce @xmath180 and rewrite the mutual @xmath1 cs effective theory",
    "as @xmath181 the charges of @xmath123 and @xmath124 are quantized as integers . converting the @xmath123 and @xmath124 charges to the @xmath182 and @xmath183 charges , we find that the @xmath182 and @xmath183 charges are still quantized as integers .",
    "however , @xmath184 charge for the @xmath182 and @xmath185 field is also allowed .",
    "the mutual cs theory ( [ cspm ] ) has one right - moving and one left - moving branches of edge excitations .",
    "the two branches of the edge excitations are described by the following 1d fermion theory @xcite @xmath186 at low energies , where @xmath187 represent terms that are consistent with the underlying symmetries of the lattice model .",
    "@xmath188 carries a unit of @xmath189 charge and @xmath190 a unit of @xmath191 charge .",
    "we note that the @xmath125 and @xmath124 charges , as the @xmath0 charge and the @xmath0 vortex , are conserved only mod 2 .",
    "so @xmath187 may contain terms that change @xmath192 charge by @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "thus , the following terms @xmath195 are allowed in the low energy effective lagrangian .",
    "the additional terms will open an energy gap for the edge excitations and one may conclude that the z2e state in the exactly soluble model ( [ hexct ] ) has no gapless edge excitations in general .",
    "however , the above conclusion is not quite correct .",
    "we see that although the presence of the edge breaks the translation symmetry in the @xmath87-direction , the finite system still has the translation symmetry in the @xmath33-direction . under the translation in the @xmath33-direction by lattice spacing , @xmath123 and @xmath126 is exchanged , or @xmath196 @xmath197 are changed into @xmath198 @xmath199 .",
    "so the translation in the @xmath33-direction changes the sign of the @xmath191 charge and hence changes @xmath200 to @xmath201 . as a result",
    ", only the following term @xmath202 can be added to the edge effective lagrangian , which do not break the translation symmetry along the edge .",
    "introducing majorana fermions @xmath203 we can rewrite the edge effective lagrangian as @xmath204 the @xmath205 term gaps a pair of majorana fermions and leave the other pair gapless .",
    "so the z2e state has right - moving and left - moving gapless edge excitations described by majorana fermions , provided that the edge is in the @xmath87- or @xmath33-direction .",
    "the presence of the translation symmetry in the @xmath87- or @xmath33-direction is crucial for the existence of the gapless edge excitations for the z2e type mutual @xmath109cs theory and the exact soluble model .    for the z2a state ,",
    "although the low energy effective theory has the same form as the exactly soluble model , the translation does not induce the exchange between @xmath123 and @xmath124 . as a result , in general , there are no gapless edge excitations for the z2a type mutual @xmath109 cs theory and the z2a state .",
    "in this paper , two kinds of @xmath0 topological ordered states for frustrated spin systems , z2a state and z2e state , are studied . using the slave - particle theory",
    ", we calculate their ground - state degeneracy , their ground - state quantum numbers , their gapless edge state , and the projective symmetry group of their quasi - particles .",
    "we propose a mutual @xmath110 chern - simons theory with two different realizations of lattice symmetry as the effective field theories that describe the two types of topological orders .",
    "we show that the effective theories produce the same low energy physics , including the degeneracy of the ground state , the quantum number for the ground state and the edge states .",
    "it turns out that the different @xmath0 topological orders are reflected in different realizations of the lattice symmetry in the same effective mutual chern - simons theory .",
    "we like to mention that the z2a phase appears to be an example of `` weak symmetry breaking in dimension 2 '' , while the z2e phase appears to be an example of `` weak symmetry breaking in dimension 1 '' discussed in ref . .",
    "so these two phases are examples of the two basic ways that lattice symmetries and topological structure can be entangled .",

    "[ h2 ] that , at @xmath221 , @xmath218 has a positive energy @xmath219 has a negative energy .",

    "similarly , we find that the @xmath224 level is occupied by a @xmath225 particle , the @xmath226 level is occupied by a @xmath225 particle and a @xmath227 particle .",
    "therefore , four particles occupy the points @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 .",
    "because the meanfield ground state @xmath230 has even number particles , it survives the even - particle - per - site projection .",
