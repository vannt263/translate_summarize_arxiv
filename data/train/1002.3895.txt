    "a recurring theme in condensed matter physics has been the discovery and classification of distinctive phases of matter .",
    "often , phases can be understood using landau s approach , which characterizes states in terms of underlying symmetries that are spontaneously broken . over the past 30 years",
    ", the study of the quantum hall effect has led to a different classification paradigm , based on the notion of _ topological order _",
    "the state responsible for the quantum hall effect does not break any symmetries , but it defines a topological phase in the sense that certain fundamental properties ( such as the quantized value of the hall conductance , and the number of gapless boundary modes ) are insensitive to smooth changes in materials parameters and can not change unless the system passes through a quantum phase transition .    in the past five years a new field has emerged in condensed matter physics , based on the realization that the spin orbit interaction can lead to topological insulating electronic phases @xcite , and on the prediction and observation of these phases in real materials @xcite .",
    "a topological insulator , like an ordinary insulator , has a bulk energy gap separating the highest occupied electronic band from the lowest empty band .",
    "the surface ( or edge in two dimensions ) of a topological insulator , however , necessarily has gapless states that are protected by time reversal symmetry . the topological insulator is closely related to the two dimensional ( 2d ) integer quantum hall state , which also has unique edge states .",
    "the surface ( or edge ) states of a topological insulator lead to a conducting state with properties unlike any other known 1d or 2d electronic systems .",
    "in addition to their fundamental interest , these states are predicted to have special properties that could be useful for applications ranging from spintronics to quantum computation .    the concept of topological order @xcite is often used to characterize the intricately correlated fractional quantum hall states @xcite , which require an inherently many body approach to understand @xcite .",
    "however , topological considerations also apply to the simpler integer quantum hall states @xcite , for which an adequate description can be formulated in terms of single particle quantum mechanics . in this regard , topological insulators are similar to the integer quantum hall effect . due to the presence of a single particle energy gap ,",
    "electron - electron interactions do not modify the state in an essential way .",
    "topological insulators can be understood within the framework of the band theory of solids @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that after more than 80 years , there are still treasures to be uncovered within band theory .    in this colloquium article",
    "we will review the theoretical and experimental foundations of this rapidly developing field .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : topobandtheory ] with an introduction to topological band theory , in which we will explain the topological order in the quantum hall effect and in topological insulators . we will also give a short introduction to topological superconductors , which can be understood within a similar framework . a unifying feature of these states",
    "is the _ bulk - boundary correspondence _ , which relates the topological structure of bulk crystal to the presence of gapless boundary modes .",
    "section iii will describe the 2d topological insulator , also known as a quantum spin hall insulator and discuss the discovery of this phase in hgcdte quantum wells .",
    "section iv is devoted to 3d topological insulators .",
    "we will review their experimental discovery in bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , as well as more recent work on  second generation \" materials bi@xmath2se@xmath3 and bi@xmath2te@xmath3 .",
    "section v will focus on exotic states that can occur at the surface of a topological insulator due to an induced energy gap .",
    "an energy gap induced by a magnetic field or proximity to a magnetic material leads to a novel quantum hall state , along with a topological magnetoelectric effect .",
    "an energy gap due to proximity with a superconductor leads to a state that supports majorana fermions , and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation . in section vi we will conclude with a discussion of new materials , new experiments and open problems .",
    "some aspects of this subject have been described in other reviews , including the review of the quantum spin hall effect by @xcite and surveys by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the insulating state is the most basic state of matter .",
    "the simplest insulator is an atomic insulator , with electrons bound to atoms in closed shells .",
    "such a material is electrically inert because it takes a finite energy to dislodge an electron .",
    "stronger interaction between atoms in a crystal leads to covalent bonding .",
    "one of the triumphs of quantum mechanics in the 20th century was the development of the band theory of solids , which provides a language for describing the electronic structure of such states .",
    "this theory exploits the translational symmetry of the crystal to classify electronic states in terms of their crystal momentum @xmath4 , defined in a periodic brillouin zone .",
    "the bloch states @xmath5 , defined in a single unit cell of the crystal , are eigenstates of the bloch hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath7 define energy bands that collectively form the band structure . in an insulator",
    "an energy gap separates the occupied valence band states from the empty conduction band states .",
    "though the gap in an atomic insulator , like solid argon , is much larger than that of a semiconductor , there is a sense in which both belong to the same phase .",
    "one can imagine tuning the hamiltonian so as to interpolate continuously between the two without closing the energy gap .",
    "such a process defines a topological equivalence between different insulating states .",
    "if one adopts a slightly coarser  stable \" topological classification scheme , which equates states with different numbers of trivial core bands , then all conventional insulators are equivalent .",
    "indeed , such insulators are equivalent to the _ vacuum _ , which according to dirac s relativistic quantum theory also has an energy gap ( for pair production ) , a conduction band ( electrons ) and a valence band ( positrons ) .",
    "are _ all _ electronic states with an energy gap topologically equivalent to the vacuum ?",
    "the answer is no , and the counterexamples are fascinating states of matter .      .",

    "the chern number @xmath10 that distinguishes the two states is a topological invariant similar to the genus.,width=288 ]    the simplest counterexample is the integer quantum hall state @xcite , which occurs when electrons confined to two dimensions are placed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the quantization of the electrons circular orbits with cyclotron frequency @xmath11 leads to quantized landau levels with energy @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 landau levels are filled and the rest are empty , then an energy gap separates the occupied and empty states just like in an insulator . unlike an insulator ,",
    "though , an electric field causes the cyclotron orbits to drift , leading to a hall current characterized by the quantized hall conductivity @xmath14 the quantization of @xmath15 has been measured to one part in @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this precision is a manifestation of the topological nature of @xmath15 .",
    "landau levels can be viewed as a  band structure \" .",
    "since the generators of translations do not commute with one another in a magnetic field , electronic states can not be labeled with momentum . however , if a unit cell with area @xmath17 enclosing a flux quantum is defined , then _ lattice _",
    "translations _ do _ commute , so bloch s theorem allows states to be labeled by 2d crystal momentum @xmath4 . in the absence of a periodic potential ,",
    "the energy levels are simply the @xmath4 independent landau levels , @xmath18 . in the presence of a periodic potential with the same lattice periodicity",
    ", the energy levels will disperse with @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to a band structure that looks identical to that of an ordinary insulator .      what is the difference between a quantum hall state characterized by and an ordinary insulator ?",
    "the answer , explained in a seminal @xcite paper by thouless , kohmoto , nightingale and den nijs(tknn ) is a matter of topology .",
    "a 2d band structure consists of a mapping from the crystal momentum @xmath4 ( defined on a torus ) to the bloch hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "gapped band structures can be classified topologically by considering the equivalence classes of @xmath6 that can be continuously deformed into one another without closing the energy gap .",
    "these classes are distinguished by a topological invariant @xmath19 ( @xmath20 denotes the integers ) called the chern invariant .",
    "the chern invariant is rooted in the mathematical theory of fiber bundles@xcite , but it can be understood physically in terms of the berry phase@xcite associated with bloch wavefunctions @xmath5 .",
    "provided there are no accidental degeneracies , when @xmath4 is transported around a closed loop , @xmath5 acquires a well defined berry phase given by the line integral of @xmath21 .",
    "this may be expressed as a surface integral of the berry flux , @xmath22 .",
    "the chern invariant is the total berry flux in the brillouin zone , @xmath23 @xmath24 is integer quantized for reasons analogous to the quantization of the dirac magnetic monopole .",
    "the total chern number , summed over all occupied bands , @xmath25 is invariant even if there are degeneracies between occupied bands , provided the gap separating occupied and empty bands remains finite .",
    "tknn showed that @xmath15 , computed using the kubo formula has the same form , so that @xmath13 in is identical to @xmath10 .",
    "the chern number @xmath10 is a topological invariant in the sense that it can not change when the hamiltonian varies smoothly .",
    "this helps to explain the robust quantization of @xmath15 .",
    "the meaning of can be clarified by a simple analogy . rather than maps from the brillioun zone to a hilbert space ,",
    "consider simpler maps from 2d to 3d , which describe surfaces .",
    "2d surfaces can be topologically classified by their genus , @xmath26 , which counts the number of holes .",
    "for instance , a sphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : insulator](c ) ) has @xmath8 , while a donut ( fig .",
    "[ fig : insulator](f ) ) has @xmath9 .",
    "a beautiful theorem in mathematics due to gauss and bonnet @xcite states that the integral of the gaussian curvature over a closed surface is a quantized topological invariant , and its value is related to @xmath26 .",
    "the chern number is an integral of a related curvature .",
    "a simple example of the quantum hall effect in a band theory is provided by a model of graphene in a periodic magnetic field introduced by @xcite .",
    "we will briefly digress here to introduce graphene because it will provide insight into the conception of the 2d quantum spin hall insulator , and because the physics of dirac electrons present in graphene has important parallels at the surface of a 3d topological insulator .",
    "graphene is a 2d form of carbon that is of high current interest @xcite .",
    "what makes graphene interesting electronically is the fact that the conduction band and valence band touch each other at two distinct points in the brillouin zone . near those points",
    "the electronic dispersion resembles the linear dispersion of massless relativistic particles , described by the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the simplest description of graphene employs a two band model for the @xmath27 orbitals on the two equivalent atoms in the unit cell of graphene s honeycomb lattice .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian is then a @xmath28 matrix , @xmath29 where @xmath30 are pauli matrices and @xmath31 . the combination of inversion ( @xmath32 ) and time reversal ( @xmath33 ) symmetry requires @xmath34 because @xmath32 takes @xmath35 to @xmath36 , while @xmath33 takes @xmath35 to @xmath37 .",
    "the dirac points occur because the two component @xmath38 can have point zeros in two dimensions . in graphene",
    "they occur at two points , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , whose locations at the brillouin zone corners are fixed by graphene s rotational symmetry . for small @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a velocity , so @xmath44 has the form of a 2d massless dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the degeneracy at the dirac point is protected by @xmath32 and @xmath33 symmetry . by breaking these symmetries",
    "the degeneracy can be lifted .",
    "for instance , @xmath32 symmetry is violated if the two atoms in the unit cell are inequivalent .",
    "this allows @xmath35 to be non zero .",
    "if @xmath35 is small , then near @xmath39 becomes a massive dirac hamiltonian , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the dispersion @xmath47 has an energy gap @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 symmetry requires the dirac point at @xmath50 has a mass @xmath51 with the same magnitude _ and _ sign , @xmath52 .",
    "this state describes an ordinary insulator .",
    "@xcite imagined lifting the degeneracy by breaking @xmath49 symmetry with a magnetic field that is zero on the average , but has the full symmetry the lattice .",
    "this perturbation allows nonzero @xmath35 and introduces a mass to the dirac points .",
    "however , @xmath32 symmetry requires the masses at @xmath53 and @xmath50 have _ opposite _ sign , @xmath54 .",
    "haldane showed that this gapped state is not an insulator , but rather a quantum hall state with @xmath55 .",
    "this non - zero hall conductivity can be understood in terms of .",
    "for a two level hamiltonian of the form of it is well known that the berry flux@xcite is related to the solid angle subtended by the unit vector @xmath56 , so that takes the form @xmath57 this simply counts the number of times @xmath58 wraps around the unit sphere as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "when the masses @xmath59 @xmath58 is confined to the equator @xmath60 , with a unit ( and opposite ) winding around each of the dirac points where @xmath61 . for small but finite @xmath62 , @xmath63 everywhere , and @xmath64 visits the north or south pole , depending on the sign of @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that each dirac point contributes @xmath65 to @xmath15 . in the insulating state with @xmath66 the two cancel , so @xmath67 . in the quantum hall state",
    "they add .",
    "it is essential that there were an _ even _ number of dirac points , since otherwise the hall conductivity would be quantized to a half integer .",
    "this is in fact guaranteed by the _ fermion doubling theorem _",
    "@xcite , which states that for a @xmath49 invariant system dirac points must come in pairs .",
    "we will return to this issue in section [ sec:3d ] , where the surface of a topological insulator provides a loophole for this theorem .",
    "a fundamental consequence of the topological classification of gapped band structures is the existence of gapless conducting states at interfaces where the topological invariant changes .",
    "such edge states are well known at the interface between the integer quantum hall state and vacuum @xcite .",
    "they may be understood in terms of the skipping motion electrons execute as their cyclotron orbits bounce off the edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qhalledge](a ) ) .",
    "importantly , the electronic states responsible for this motion are _ chiral _ in the sense that they propagate in one direction only along the edge . these states are insensitive to disorder because there are no states available for backscattering  a fact that underlies the perfectly quantized electronic transport in the quantum hall effect .    the existence of such  one way \" edge states is deeply related to the topology of the bulk quantum hall state .",
    "imagine an interface where a crystal slowly interpolates as a function of distance @xmath68 between a quantum hall state ( @xmath69 ) and a trivial insulator ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "somewhere along the way the energy gap has to vanish , because otherwise it is impossible for the topological invariant to change .",
    "there will therefore be low energy electronic states bound to the region where the energy gap passes through zero .",
    "this interplay between topology and gapless modes is ubiquitous in physics , and has appeared in many contexts .",
    "it was originally found by @xcite in their analysis of a 1d field theory .",
    "similar ideas were used by @xcite to describe soliton states in polyacetalene .",
    "a simple theory of the chiral edge states based on @xcite can be developed using the two band dirac model .",
    "consider an interface where the mass @xmath62 at one of the dirac points changes sign as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "we thus let @xmath71 , where @xmath72 gives the insulator for @xmath73 and @xmath74 gives the quantum hall state for @xmath75 .",
    "assume @xmath76 is fixed .",

    "this band of states intersects the fermi energy @xmath81 with a positive group velocity @xmath82 and defines a right moving chiral edge mode .        in the 1980 s related ideas",
    "were applied to narrow gap semiconductors , which can be modeled using a 3d massive dirac hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "an interface where the dirac mass changes sign is associated with gapless 2d dirac fermion states .",
    "these share some similarities with the surface states of a 3d topological insulator , but as we shall see in section [ sec : strongweak ] , there is a fundamental difference . in a separate development , @xcite showed that in lattice quantum chromodynamics 4d chiral fermions could be simulated on a 5d lattice by introducing a similar domain wall .",
    "this provided a method for circumventing the doubling theorem@xcite , which prevented the simulation of chiral fermions on a 4d lattice .",
    "quantum hall edge states and surface states of a topological insulator evade similar doubling theorems .",
    "the chiral edge states in the quantum hall effect can be seen explicitly by solving the haldane model in a semi - infinite geometry with an edge at @xmath83 . fig .",

    "can be modified .",
    "for instance , @xmath85 could develop a kink so that the edge states intersect @xmath81 three times  twice with a positive group velocity and once with a negative group velocity .",
    "the difference @xmath86 between the number of right and left moving modes , however , can not change , and is determined by the topological structure of the bulk states .",
    "this is summarized by the _ bulk - boundary correspondence _ : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the difference in the chern number across the interface .      since the hall conductivity is odd under @xmath49 , the topologically non trivial states described in the preceding section",
    "can only occur when @xmath49 symmetry is broken .",
    "however , the spin orbit interaction allows a _ different _ topological class of insulating band structures when @xmath49 symmetry is unbroken @xcite .",

    "section we will discuss some very recent developments and look toward the future .    in the history of condensed matter physics , the single most important ingredient in the emergence of a new field is the perfection of the techniques for producing high quality materials .",

    "topological insulator materials need to be perfected , so that they actually insulate .",

    "the detailed study of the electronic and spin transport properties of the surface states is called for , complemented by a host of other probes , ranging from optics to tunneling spectroscopy .    another direction for future innovation",
    "will be the study of _ heterostructures _ involving topological insulators and other materials .",
    "in addition to providing a means for protecting and controlling the population of the surface states , such structures could provide a step towards the longer term goal of engineering exotic states , such as majorana fermions , with the surface states .",
    "there are many materials problems to be solved in order to find appropriate magnetic and superconducting materials which exhibit the appropriate proximity effects with the surface states , and detailed experiments will be necessary to characterize those states . an exciting recent development along these lines",

    "one can imagine devices fabricated with techniques of _ modulation doping _ that have proved extremely powerful in semiconductor physics .",
    "one can also imagine other devices that integrate magnetic materials with topological insulators , to take advantage of the special spin properties of the surface states .",

    "have suggested that certain iridium based pyrochlore compounds may be strong topological insulators .",
    "since these materials involve @xmath171 electrons , a crucial issue will be to understand the interplay between strong electron - electron interactions and the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "very recent theoretical work predicts topological insulator behavior in ternary heusler compounds@xcite and other materials @xcite .",
    "these are exciting new directions where further theoretical and experimental work is called for .",
    "topological superconductors present another exciting frontier direction .",
    "in addition to observing the surface majorana modes predicted for @xmath242he b @xcite , it will be very interesting to predict and observe electronic topological superconductors , to characterize their surface modes and to explore their potential utility .",
    "to this end there has been recent progress in developing methods to theoretically identify topological superconductors based on their band structure @xcite .",
    "more generally there may be other interesting correlated states related to topological insulators and superconductors .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that a @xmath49 invariant _ fractional _ quantum spin hall state can be topologically stable .",
    "this points to a general theoretical problem associated with the topological classification of _ interacting _ systems : how do we unify the seemingly different notions of topological order epitomized by @xcite and by @xcite ?",
    "the topological field theories studied by @xcite , as well as tantalizing connections with string theory @xcite provide steps in this direction , but a complete theory remains to be developed .",
    "to conclude , the recent advances in the physics of topological insulators have been driven by a rich interplay between theoretical insight and experimental discoveries .",
