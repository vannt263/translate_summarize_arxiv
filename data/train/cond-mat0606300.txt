    "neutron scattering experiments in the lanthanum family of cuprates .",
    "the above authors have interpreted the resulting four peaks , as coming from two different kinds of stripe domains , each exhibiting a unidirectional spin modulation ( referred to below as 1d ) running along one of the two principal lattice directions .",
    "the 1d spin modulation was to be accompanied by the 1d charge modulation peaked around the antiphase magnetic boundaries , hence the name  stripes \" .",
    "there exists , however , an alternative interpretation sometimes referred to as grid or checkerboard , which stipulates that the four - fold splitting of the @xmath3 neutron peak is caused by a two - dimensional ( 2d ) modulation of the af order shown in fig .",

    "the insight of that work was not completely trivial , since its appearance predated the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) studies of vershinin _",
    "et al_.@xcite , hanaguri _ et al_.@xcite , and the neutron study of hinkov _",
    "et al_.@xcite  all three are the works , that brought the dimensionality of generic spin modulations in cuprates back into the spotlight ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the connection between the inhomogeneous structures in lanthanum cuprates and the generic properties of other high - temperature cuprate superconductors is a delicate issue .",
    "spin and charge modulations observed in this cuprate family may turn out to be a composition - specific feature , or , in the opposite extreme , similar modulations may be universally present in all families of cuprates but observable only in the lanthanum family due to anomalous slowing down . in this context , the difference in the dimensionality of the modulation is not inconsequential .",
    "the apparent message contained in the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter@xcite , the symmetry of the pseudogap@xcite , the sts observations on the surface of bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( bi-2212)@xcite and ca@xmath6na@xmath7cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4@xcite is two - dimensional .",
    "therefore , if the 1d nature of the spin modulations in lanthanum cuprates is established conclusively , then , in the opinion of this author , it will likely imply the composition - specific nature of the phenomenon .",
    "( the authors of refs.@xcite seem to have the opposite expectation . ) in contrast , if the spin modulations in this cuprate family are two - dimensional , then this would be yet another indication that the tendency to form 2d modulations is a general property of cuprates and , therefore , may be essential for the mechanism of superconductivity",
    ". the differences between different geometries of 2d modulations should be much less important . in lanthanum cuprates",
    ", magnetic modulations may develop into a diagonal grid pattern , while , in other cuprates , the system may phase separate into more - af - correlated and less - af - correlated nano - clusters@xcite without forming quasi - static magnetic order and , therefore , not accompanied by antiphase boundaries .    since the argument for the non - universality of the modulations in lanthanum cuprates has merit , it is important to establish the dimensionality of these modulations without invoking the knowledge about other families of cuprates or nickelates .",
    "the discussion in the literature specific to lanthanum cuprates has been limited so far mostly to neutron@xcite and hard x - ray@xcite experiments .",

    "et al_.@xcite has not addressed the dimensionality issue either .",
    "the direct attempts to discriminate between 1d stripe and 2d grid patterns have been made so far only on the basis of the orientation of charge satellites@xcite , which represent the response of the lattice to the periodic charge and/or spin modulations .    in refs.@xcite , the analysis of experiments is based on landau expansion@xcite , which requires small spin and charge modulations .",
    "the resulting charge patterns for the 1d and the 2d cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - patterns](a , b ) . in the framework of landau expansion , leading charge peaks corresponding to 1d stripe and 2d grid pictures do not coincide , and , therefore , the observation of charge satellites expected for the 1d case together with the non - observation of the satellites expected for the 2d case ( notwithstanding the weakness of the charge signal ) do present a clear argument .",
    "( 75 , 210 ) ( -5 , -5 ) = 2.6 in    there are , however , good reasons to expect that the amplitude of the spin modulations is not small . for example , as indicated by @xmath8sr@xcite , the amplitude of the modulated staggered magnetization in la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is large  about half of the staggered moment of the undoped parent compound",
    ". strong modulation of staggered magnetization would induce a deeper local potential for charge carriers thus forcing them to be stronger localized around the antiphase boundaries .",
    "larger amplitude of charge modulation implies stronger interaction between the charge carriers , which would undermine the theoretical basis for the landau expansion and introduce new charge peaks .",
    "one particular problem with the landau expansion is that it gives the maximum of charge density around the nodes of the antiphase grid [ see fig .  [ fig - patterns](b ) ] .",
    "if the charge modulations are large , then the coulomb repulsion between the charge carriers would rather lead to a smaller charge density around the nodes .    in the case of large charge modulations , the leading charge peaks corresponding to the 1d and 2d interpretations of the magnetic @xmath3 peak",
    "splitting can coincide .",
    "if charge density is reasonably localized around the antiphase grid but avoids grid nodes , then a useful insight can be gained from analysing the density profile shown in fig .",

    "this profile was mentioned in ref.@xcite but not elaborated upon .",
    "it corresponds to the same splitting of magnetic @xmath13 peak as the one arising from the 1d stripes spaced by @xmath14 .",
    "the cos@xmath15 factors in eq.([rho ] ) set the grid pattern , while the sin@xmath16 factors suppress the intensity near the grid nodes .",
    "the positions of the resulting charge peaks and their relative intensities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - peaks ] .",
    "( see the appendix for the calculation . )",
    "leading charge peaks corresponding to 1d stripes spaced by @xmath14 and to modulation ( [ rho ] ) coincide with each other and are located at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where charge peaks were detected in refs.@xcite .",
    "modulation ( [ rho ] ) also generates peaks at @xmath19 predicted by landau expansion , but these peaks have only third largest intensity ( about 7 times smaller than the intensities of the leading peaks ) .",
    "the peaks of the second largest intensity ( 4 times smaller than that of the leading peaks ) are located at @xmath20 .",
    "it may appear that the leading peak position for the density profile ( [ rho ] ) is the result of a fine tuning of the powers of sine and cosine .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "the only important aspect of this profile is that the factors sin@xmath16 suppress the charge density near the grid nodes , as required by the coulomb repulsion between charges . as illustrated in the appendix ,",
    "if the sin@xmath16 factors are removed , then the leading peaks are located at the position predicted by the landau expansion , but , if they are left , then the position of the leading peaks at @xmath17 and @xmath18 does not depend on the power of the cosine factors .",
    "the unrealistic aspect of profile ( [ rho ] ) is that the sin@xmath16 factors suppress the charge density near the grid nodes _",
    "completely_. however , even an incomplete coulomb suppression of the charge density near the grid nodes can easily shift the intensity maximum from the landau expansion result to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "( 75 , 75 ) ( 1 , 0 ) = 2.7 in    from the above perspective , it is the non - observation of the weaker @xmath19 and @xmath20 peaks rather than the observation of the @xmath18 peaks that would be the real argument in favor of the 1d interpretation .",
    "however , to the best of this author s knowledge , the open literature contains only one experimental scan across the @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for la@xmath23nd@xmath24sr@xmath25cuo@xmath2 . in that case , the experimental resolution was just not sufficient to claim observation or non - observation of the peaks , which would be 4 or 7 times weaker than the leading peak observed at @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , quite remarkably the scan around @xmath27 shows a promising sign of a peak . repeating that scan with a better resolution would certainly have merit .",
    "another argument frequently cited in support of the 1d stripe picture is that the observability of static spin and charge modulations is correlated with the onset of the `` non - generic '' low temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) crystal phase .",
    "et al_.@xcite have proposed , that the 1d stripes follow the lattice anisotropy of the ltt phase .",
    "this anisotropy alternates between adjacent cuo@xmath4 planes , which would imply , that stripes in two adjacent planes run perpendicular to each other .",
    "empirically , however , the onset of the ltt phase is not a necessary condition for the observability of static modulations , because quasielastic signatures of spin modulations have also been reported for the `` generic '' low temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) phase of la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath2 with and without zn codoping@xcite .",
    "but one can still hope that the presence of the ltt phase is at least a sufficient condition for the observability of static modulations .    although the above proposition of tranquada _",
    "et al_. has visual appeal , the onset of the ltt phase as such does not readily discriminate between the stripe and the grid interpretations .",
    "the general expectation is that the magnetic @xmath3 peak splittings observed by elastic neutron scattering in the ltt phase and by inelastic neutron scattering in the lto phase have the same origin .",
    "if true , this implies that the system has chosen the dimensionality of the modulation pattern ( 1d or 2d ) without the ltt phase being involved , and then the ltt phase only plays a role in slowing the modulations down , to make them observable in elastic experiments@xcite .",
    "therefore , to claim that the symmetry of the ltt phase discriminates between the grid and the stripe pictures is equivalent to claiming that the ltt phase would slow down fluctuating stripes , but would _ not _ slow down fluctuating grid .",
    "this author is not aware of any experimental or theoretical result , which would support the latter part of this claim .",
    "the picture of stripes running in perpendicular directions in the adjacent planes has further difficulty that such a configuration is not most favorable energetically from the viewpoint of interplane coulomb interaction .",
    "the lowest coulomb energy corresponds to stripes running in the same direction in two adjacent planes with pattern in one plane shifted with respect to the other by half a period of charge modulation . since the stripes are unscreened",
    "lines of charge , the interplane coulomb energy should be large .",
    "can the coupling of stripes with the lattice anisotropy outweigh the coulomb coupling between stripes from adjacent planes ?",
    "it does not seem very likely .",
    "recently , robertson et al.@xcite have also argued that , due to the anisotropy of the ltt phase , the incommensurate grid modulation should have slightly different periodicity in the adjacent cuo@xmath4 planes , which should lead to 8-fold splitting of the @xmath3 peak instead of the 4-fold splitting observed experimentally . since the crystal lattice periods can not be detectably different in the adjacent planes ( because of the prohibitive elastic energy cost ) , the argument of roberson et al . is not very direct , as it relies on the additional theoretical assumption , that the mechanism similar to the fermi - surface nesting is behind the formation of the grid superstructure .",
    "this argument has further difficulty , that the mismatch of the charge superstructure periods would lead to the regions , where the maxima of charge modulation density in two adjacent planes lie on the top of each other , which , in turn , leads to a large coulomb energy cost .",
    "the critical discussion so far does not change the fact that the observed positions of the charge peaks , and the involvement of the lto - ltt transition can not be turned into an argument favoring the grid over the stripe pictures , and to this extent , these two observations do support the 1d stripe interpretation . in the present case , however , the the presumption of innocence can be rephrased as follows : a two - dimensional experimental peak pattern should be considered as an evidence for two - dimensional superstructure unless conclusively proven otherwise . in the opinion of this author ,",
    "the above cited facts fall far short of delivering a conclusive proof .",
    "one can , however , start from the  presumption of guilt \" by considering the 2d grid interpretation of the 2d neutron data as  exotic \" , and requiring compelling reasons to choose it over the 1d stripe picture .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to analyse the nqr experiments from this perspective , and to point out that , within the limits of experimental uncertainties , they do constitute a clear indication in favor of the 2d grid interpretation .",
    "a slowly fluctuating spin modulation , 1d or 2d , is expected to freeze at sufficiently low temperatures thus leading to a broad nqr spectrum having shape , which may discriminate between different dimensionalities of the modulation . in ref.[1 ] , hunt _ et al_. have presented , among other findings , the results of their nqr study of la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 aimed at testing the stripe interpretation of neutron scattering experiments . at temperatures below 8k , they have , indeed observed a broad nqr spectrum of @xmath28cu [ shown in fig .  [ fig - hunt](f ) ] , which signified the expected freezing of local hyperfine fields affecting copper nuclear spins .",
    "this study was done in the context of a broader effort to elucidate the dynamics of electronic spins in lanthanum cuprates by the means of nuclear magnetic and quadrupole resonances@xcite    ( 75 , 140 ) ( -5 , 0 ) = 3.3 in    the above nqr spectrum has exhibited one clear feature , the 31  mhz peak , but an important theoretical finding of hunt _",
    "et al_. was that this particular peak should be present for any continuous distribution of hyperfine fields passing the interval 0.5 - 1.5  t , where the minima of two nqr frequency branches are located - both corresponding to frequency 31  mhz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - freq ] ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of the 31  mhz peak could not discriminate between different kinds of modulations .",
    "apart from this peak , the spectrum has exhibited no other structure .",
    "( 75 , 60 ) (-8 , 0 ) = 3.4 in    hunt _ et al_. have attempted to fit the nqr spectrum to the predictions of many possible 1d _ static _ stripe pictures , but have found that all such pictures lead to very structured lineshapes having several peaks not observed experimentally [ see figs .  [ fig - hunt](a - d ) ] .",
    "the origin of the structure in theoretical nqr lineshapes is two - fold .",
    "( i ) for commensurate superstructures , there is only a finite number of distinct nuclear sites .",
    "the traces of this discreetness then appear in the nqr lineshape .",
    "( ii ) for uniform incommensurate 1d modulations , which contain the infinite number of distinct sites , the peaks in the nqr lineshapes result from a van hove singularity in the distribution of 1d - modulated hyperfine fields .",
    "this singularity is located at the maximum in the absolute value of the hyperfine fields [ see the middle panel of fig  [ fig - hunt](d ) ] .    a priori , a 2d grid modulation represents a promising alternative to interpret the rather featureless nqr spectrum of hunt _",
    "et al_. , because , when the grid is commensurate , it contains a larger number of inequivalent nuclear sites , and thus tends to produce more smeared structure in nqr lineshape , and , when the grid is incommensurate , it would _ not _ lead to a van hove singularity at the maximum value of 2d modulated hyperfine fields .",
    "( it would lead to a singularity around the zero value of hyperfine field , but that singularity is less important .",
    "see the next section . )",
    "hunt _ et al_. have considered the possibility of grid modulation , but only the commensurate version with the orientation rotated by 45 degrees in comparison to the one expected from the positions of neutron peaks . in this way",
    ", they have , nevertheless , obtained a much better agreement with experiment in comparison with any of the 1d interpretations [ see fig .  [ fig - hunt](e ) ] , which is not very surprising in view of the preceeding discussion . yet , the grid pattern used by hunt _",
    "et al_. generated too much structure , which led them to abandon the grid interpretation all together and to test another one in terms of the random distribution of hypefine fields .",
    "the latter interpretation gave nearly perfect agreement with the experimental nqr spectrum [ fig .",
    "[ fig - hunt](f ) ] .",
    "the problem with that interpretation is that the random configuration of staggered spin polarizations is inconsistent with the modulations of af spin structure observed by neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "random picture should also lead to a monotonic decay of the @xmath8sr asymmetry signal rather than the oscillations observed in experiment@xcite .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath8sr asymmetry oscillations implies that the modulation amplitude of the staggered polarization is about @xmath29@xcite , where @xmath30 is bohr magneton .",
    "this number imposes a difficult constraint on the interpretations of nqr spectrum .",
    "et al_. , have concluded that any kind of static broadening of the hyperfine field distribution corresponding to the modulation amplitude @xmath29 would fail to reproduce their nqr spectrum , because it would introduce too much spectral weight in the higher frequency interval , where much smaller weight is observed experimentally .",
    "they have found , however , that with the modulation amplitude @xmath31 and a very significant degree of broadening ( 50 - 100 per cent of the modulation amplitude ) , the observed nqr spectra can be reproduced .",
    "hunt _ et al_. have suggested that the above discrepancy may be due to spin fluctuations on the nqr timescale of 20 @xmath8s , which are not seen on the faster @xmath8sr timescale of 0.5@xmath8s .",
    "this suggestion , however , runs into the difficulty , that , in order to change the shape of the effective distribution of hyperfine fields , spins should fluctuate on the time scale of inverse nqr frequency ( @xmath32s ) or faster .",
    "( this , presumably , happens at temperatures higher than 30  k. ) the fluctuations on the scale of 20 @xmath8s can lead to the loss of resonant spins , which , in turn , can reduce the integrated signal intensity but should not change the shape of the spectral line .",
    "this is consistent with the fact , that the nqr spectra of hunt _ et al_. have identical shape but different intensity at 1.7  k and 350  mk .",
    "even if , one insists that the spin fluctuations may affect the observed nqr lineshape despite the above argument , one would have to make a further assumption that these fluctuations remain temperature - independent as the temperature is reduced by a factor of 5 from 1.7  k to 350  k , which is quite unlikely .",
    "the present work has been motivated by the observation that hunt _ et al_. did not consider incommensurate grid modulation , which has promise of describing their experiment without difficult assumptions .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , hunt _ et al_. have considered grid modulation , which had different orientation , in comparison to the one that follows from the neutron experiments .",

    "importantly , the amplitude of spin modulation used for the present calculation ( @xmath92 ) is consistent with the frequency of the @xmath8sr asymmetry oscillations@xcite .",
    "one can further observe that the shape of the distribution of hyperfine fields seen by nuclear spins should not be too different from the shape of the distribution of magnetic fields experienced by muons .",
    "( simulations in ref.@xcite indeed suggest so away from the close vicinity to the zero value of the field . ) therefore , by fourier transforming the distribution of the hyperfine fields , one can obtain a rough estimate of the amplitude of the @xmath8sr asymmetry oscillations .",
    "such a fourier transform is shown in the inset of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig - main](c ) .",
    "it exhibits clear oscillations with the amplitude roughly consistent with but smaller than the @xmath8sr observations .",
    "( the frequency of @xmath8sr asymmetry oscillations should , of course be rescaled with the strength of muon - electron magnetic coupling . )",
    "it should be mentioned though , that , in the absense of nqr data , the the smallness of the oscillation amplitude was considered by kojima _",
    "@xcite as an argument against the grid interpretation .    to summarize , none of the propositions considered by hunt",
    "et al_.@xcite came close to the kind of simultaneous agreement with the nqr and @xmath8sr results obtained in this section for the disordered incommensurate grid modulation .",
    "the significance of the findings presented in the previous section should be viewed in the context of uncertainties of the theoretical framework , within which these findings were obtained .",
    "an important quantitative check of that framework is the fact , that it correctly predicts the experimental position of the 31  mhz peak .",
    "it is the check of the correctness of hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "more specifically , since the value of @xmath57 is known from the high - temperature measurements , the above agreement amounts to a combined consistency check of the assumptions that the hamiltonian is axially symmetric and that local hyperfine fields are parallel to the cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "one uncertainty of the treatment in section  [ computational ] is associated with the assumption of completely random distribution of a- and b - type nuclei in the inhomogeneous background .",
    "one can object , that charged grid lines are attracted to dopant atoms , and hence the nuclei of b - type ( attributed to the vicinity of dopant atoms ) see quite different environment than a - type nuclei@xcite .",
    "it may happen , for example , that small amplitude fluctuations of grid lines wipe out the signal from b - nuclei , while leaving a significant signal coming from a - nuclei .",
    "it turns out , however , that , if only a - type ( majority ) nuclei are included in the calculation for the disorder broadened incommensurate grid then the agreement between the theory and the experiment becomes even better than the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - main](c ) .",
    "a related difficulty is that the charge modulation , as it becomes stabilized , creates extra electric field gradient , which can lead to an extra broadening of the distribution of @xmath57 .",
    "a priori , the relative value of this broadening in comparison with the one due to the intrinsic factors ( such as charged dopants or crystal imperfections ) is difficult to estimate .",
    "however , it is also difficult to see , why the modulation - induced broadening would be much larger than the `` intrinsic '' one , known from the width of the high temperature nqr spectra . if it is not much larger , then the related uncertainty is not very significant .",
    "another important element missing from the description in section  [ computational ] is what happens in the system as a result of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 radio - frequency ( rf ) pulses of the spin echo sequence .",
    "the computational procedure of section  [ computational ] assumes that the @xmath93 and @xmath94 pulse conditions are perfectly satisfied for every transition of every spin . in reality , this can not be done simultaneously for all spins and all transitons , because ( i ) in powder samples ( used in ref.@xcite ) , the polarization of the rf field has a random orientation with respect to the lattice directions ; and ( ii ) even , if it were a single crystal , the rf field at a given frequency affects simultaneously several nqr transitions and couples to those transitions through different values of matrix elements ( which typically vary by a factor of 2 ) .",
    "the difference in the values of matrix elements implies that the pulse conditions can not be fulfilled simultaneously for every transition .    even , if one were able to manipulate each transition individually , the use of weighing factor ( [ pnn ] ) would be doubtful .",
    "such a factor is standard and appropriate , when the resonance is detected by the steady state absorption technique . in the pulsed experiments ,",
    "however , one power of the matrix element @xmath95 is absorbed into the duration of the rf pulses , which means that , if the @xmath93 and @xmath94 conditions are perfectly satisfied , one should expect a weighing factor equal to the above matrix element and not to its square as eq.([pnn ] ) suggests .",
    "when the pulse conditions are not perfectly satisfied , higher powers of that matrix element may contribute to the weighing factor , but even then , the use of the factor ( [ pnn ] ) would likely amount to a drastic oversimplification . expression  ( [ pnn ] ) was used in section  [ computational ] only to make the results directly comparable to the calculations of hunt _",
    "et al_.    yet another uncertainty of this study is the lack of theory describing the wipeout of the nqr signals on the timescale of rf pulses . in experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the duration of the rf pulses was chosen to be the one that maximizes the spin echo response .",
    "the wipeout effect would suppress the intensity of the echo , if the @xmath93 and @xmath94 conditions required too long pulses , and , therefore , could factor into the experimental definition of the pulse conditions .",
    "all unknown factors mentioned above can add up to a quantitatively significant weighing factor on the top of the theoretical calculation described in section .",
    "[ computational ] .",
    "this extra factor , however , is not expected to have strong frequency dependence and , therefore , would not mask the presence of the multiple peaks associated either with discrete or with singular distributions arising from 1d modulations of hyperfine fields .",
    "it is , therefore , the absence of the extra peaks beyond the one at 31  mhz that is the best indication against 1d stripe scenarios .",
    "the non - observation of multiple nqr peaks also constitutes an indication against spin spirals@xcite in 1/8-doped lanthanum cuprates .",
    "if the cu spins are indeed parallel to the cuo@xmath4 plane , and if the nqr tensor is axially symmetric with respect to the @xmath51-axis , then the spiral arrangement of spins implies that all nuclear sites are equivalent , which should lead to sharp multiple nqr lines .",
    "if any of the above two assumptions is incorrect then nqr spectrum should still exhibit van hove singularities similar to those shown in fig.[fig - hunt](d ) .",
    "the main message of this paper is that the absence of multiple peaks in the nqr spectra of hunt et al . can be easily explained on the basis of slightly disordered incommensurate grid modulation .",
    "the degree of disorder required for this interpretation entails approximately 10 per cent broadening of the non - disordered nqr line , which would be consistent with the fact that the signatures of spin modulations are observable by @xmath8sr . at the same time , all alternative interpretations of the above spectra in terms of 1d spin modulations encounter serious difficulties .",
    "it is , therefore , concluded that the combined @xmath8sr / nqr data favor the the 2d grid modulation over the 1d stripe or spiral modulation static or dynamic .",
    "_ note added : _ after the present manuscript was submitted , this author became aware of the preprint by christensen _",
