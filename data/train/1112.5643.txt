    "holographic qcd models are surprisingly successful in their predictions of low - energy qcd observables .",
    "however , it was discovered in earlier work that the pion condensation transition in one version of the hard - wall model has qualitatively different features than the predictions of chiral perturbation theory and other approaches .",
    "we have shown that this disagreement is due to a boundary effect related to the explicit breaking of the gauged chiral symmetry by the non - normalizable background of a 5d scalar field . to restore agreement with the chiral lagrangian we modified the boundary dynamics , either by introducing nonlinear boundary conditions on the fields , or by performing a nonlinear field redefinition which induced an infrared boundary term in the action .",
    "the field redefinition allowed us to relate the system with nonlinear boundary conditions to a standard sturm - liouville system which manifestly maintains the proper symmetry structure , justifying the subsequent kaluza - klein decomposition of the fields .",
    "the chirally improved hard - wall model makes predictions for low - energy qcd observables that agree with the original model to within 1 - 2%",
    ".    it would be useful to further explore the consequences of the modified boundary physics with regard to pion observables .",
    "it would also be interesting to find additional applications of nonlinear boundary conditions to extra - dimensional model building , for example to higgsless models and holographic technicolor models .",
    "finally , the necessity for nonlinear boundary dynamics in the hard - wall model provides motivation for further study of the mathematical problem of differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions .",
