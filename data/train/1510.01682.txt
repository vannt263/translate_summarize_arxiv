    "time - dependent few and many - body methods for driven quantum dynamics beyond linear response are urgently needed both to study fundamental effects and for possible technological applications ( involving strong light fields , for instance ) .",
    "depending on the system studied , the `` exact '' solution would involve the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger , pauli , klein - gordon , or dirac equation , possibly with quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , this is  in full dimensionality and with strong , long - wavelength lasers  even in the simplest case of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) possible only for ( at most ) two particles .",
    "the most widely used and favorably scaling approach to electronic structure problems is density functional theory @xcite . its time - dependent version , time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite , often misses important correlation effects @xcite .",
    "other , more systematic approaches such as multi - configurational time - dependent hartree - fock ( mctdhf ) @xcite and variants of it @xcite or time - dependent configuration interaction ( tdci ) @xcite and related approaches @xcite are ( much ) more demanding but capture correlation effects better @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced time - dependent renormalized - natural - orbital theory ( tdrnot ) @xcite , which is based on equations of motion for the so - called natural orbitals ( nos ) , i.e. , the eigenfunctions of the one - body reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) @xcite . while the proof that the natural orbitals form the best basis is restricted to two electrons @xcite ,",
    "the educated guess ( and hope ) is that tdrnot calculations with a very limited number of nos allow to well surpass tddft with relatively little computational overhead . in recent papers",
    ", we have demonstrated already that tdrnot performs well in treating phenomena where tddft with known exchange - correlation potentials fail , e.g. , autoionization @xcite , rabi flopping @xcite , and nonsequential ionization @xcite . in this work",

    "note that the strength of the lines in the frequency range @xmath82 $ ] is sensitive to the choice of the damping coefficient @xmath84 .",
    "however , for the purpose of benchmarking the tdrnot results that is not important as long as the same @xmath84 is used for both tdse and tdrnot .",
    "while the lines involving singly excited states are present already in the 1rno calculation , the fano lineshapes for @xmath85 $ ] are only reproduced with more than one rno per spin .",
    "this is not surprising , as one rno per spin is equivalent to time - dependent hartree - fock , which is identical to tddft in exact - exchange - only approximation .",
    "the latter is known to miss doubly excited states @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fano ] shows that already the 2rno result reproduces the fano profiles but their position is not yet satisfactory .",
    "we find that by adding more rnos the convergence to the tdse result is `` quasi - monotonous , '' i.e. , it transiently worsens for odd numbers of rnos per spin but then improves for the subsequent even number .",
    "six rnos per spin give reasonable spectra if the lowest series of doubly excited states is relevant .",
    "we found that 14 rnos are required if the next series ( with the lower electron in the second excited level ) is involved .",
    "one might expect that the calculation of hhg spectra is an easy task , even for tddft in the simple exact - exchange - only approximation .",
    "however , apart from possible correlation effects one has to keep in mind that the celebrated hhg cut - off @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 the ionization potential and @xmath88 the ponderomotive energy ) @xcite involves @xmath89 .",
    "hence , a multiple step - like structure may arise because of the different @xmath89 for different charge states in multi - electron systems .",
    "in this hhg part of our work we applied a rather long ( @xmath90 ) , flat - top 800-nm ( @xmath91 ) pulse in order to generate well - defined , sharp harmonic lines .",
    "the up and down ramping was @xmath73-shaped over two cycles .",
    "the peak intensity of the laser pulse was @xmath92 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hhg ] shows the hhg spectra obtained with tdrnot using one , two , three , and six rnos , together with the tdse benchmark . the 1rno result ( i.e. , tdhf or exact - exchange - only tddft ) misses the proper extension of the plateau due to hhg in @xmath93 .",
    "instead , it gives an unphysical second plateau , which is a replica of the first plateau due to the nonlinearities in the eom .",
    "note that the laser parameters are not in the regime where a second plateau due to single - photon double recombination occurs @xcite .",
    "the 2rno spectrum in fig .  [ fig : hhg ] reproduces the @xmath93 cut - off very well .",
    "however , unphysical harmonic peaks emerge on a level of @xmath94 well above even the 100th harmonic .",
    "the situation seems to worsen if more rnos are added .",
    "the reason for these unphysical high harmonics is truncation . by adding more and more rnos ,",
    "tdrnot is able to describe transitions to more and more doubly excited states .",
    "however , the energetic position of each new series of doubly excited states is never correct in the first place .",
    "it only converges to the right position if one adds even more rnos ( which bring new , initially poorly positioned series ) .",
    "these wrong states are responsible for the unphysical harmonics .",
    "nevertheless the quantitative agreement improves with increasing number of rnos because the harmonics up to the @xmath93 cut - off match better the tdse benchmark result .",
    "in fact , for 6 rnos per spin the tdrnot and tdse hhg peaks up to the 63rd harmonic agree very well .",
    "figure  [ fig : error ] shows the error of the tdrnot hhg spectra , i.e. , the square of the difference between the tdrnot and the tdse spectrum , integrated over all frequencies .",
    "it is seen that the error decreases with number of rnos although not strictly monotonously . similarly , the errors in the dipole acceleration @xmath95 ( integrated over the laser pulse duration ) and in the density ( integrated over space and the laser pulse duration ) were calculated and are included in fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] .    , and densities in the tdrnot results for one up to nine rnos per spin . ]",
    "in this work , we tested further the recently introduced time - dependent renormalized - natural - orbital theory ( tdrnot ) .",
    "the method is based on the equations of motion for the renormalized natural orbitals ( rnos ) , i.e. , the time - dependent eigenfunctions of the one - body reduced density matrix , normalized to their eigenvalues .",
    "tdrnot was applied again to a numerically exactly solvable model helium atom with the focus on the absorbed and emitted radiation .",
    "both absorption and high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) spectra are `` simple observables '' in the sense that the single - particle density is sufficient to calculate them .",
    "hence , one could have expected that time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) in exact exchange - only approximation would work well .",
    "however , we showed that tdrnot with just one rno per spin ( which equals tddft in exact exchange - only approximation ) fails to reproduce fano line shapes in absorption spectra due to the absence of doubly excited states . adding more rnos the fano line shapes are captured well by tdrnot .",
    "the 1-rno or tddft result for hhg spectra was qualitatively wrong because it lacked the correct cut - off originating from hhg in he@xmath0 , while predicting an unphysical second plateau .",
    "again , with increasing number of rnos the agreement with the benchmark result from the exact numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation improves .",
    "however , unphysical hhg peaks at high frequencies emerge because of the necessary truncation of the number of rnos .",
    "a tdrnot implementation for helium in full dimensionality is under way . for more than two particles approximations for the two - body reduced density matrix expansion coefficients @xmath96 in",
    "are required .",
    "testing such approximations will be the subject of future work .",
