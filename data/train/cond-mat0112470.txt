    "magnetic and non  magnetic impurities in superconductors always attracted interest and their treatment played the essential role in theories of superconductivity .    since the anderson @xcite and abrikosov , gorkov @xcite works the influence of magnetic and non  magnetic disorder on superconductors have been treated in many ways @xcite .",
    "their arguments , originally applied to classic bcs superconductors , were reexamined for novel , exotic superconductors @xcite with the anisotropic order parameters extended @xmath0wave , @xmath1wave character @xcite and also recently discovered @xcite @xmath2wave ruthenates @xcite    examining the influence of various kinds of magnetic and non  magnetic disorder caused by structural , substitutional , irradiation defects etc . on properties of conventional and unconventional superconductors",
    "has shown that their responses to disorder are quite different .",
    "in contrast to conventional materials where only magnetic impurities affect the superconducting properties , for unconventional superconductors the effect of both magnetic and non - magnetic disorder is usually strong @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not surprising , that the response to disorder become the fundamental criterion of unconventionality of the physical mechanism leading to superconductivity .",
    "moreover , effects of disorder are of interest because the high temperature superconductors have to be doped ( la@xmath5 sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 with strontium @xmath8 , yba@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath11 with oxygen @xmath12 ) to show the optimal critical temperature and doping is always accompanied by disorder .    on the other hand in these quasi two dimensional layered materials the fermi energy has been found in the vicinity of van hove singularities of the electron density of states @xcite .",
    "this has lead to formulation of van hove scenario for high temperature superconductors which says that optimal critical temperature is reached when chemical potential passes through the van hove singularity in the density of states @xcite .",
    "doping with charge carriers does not only change the density in the system but also smear the density of states eliminating its singularities and , specially for anisotropic superconductors , introduce the electron pair  breaking phenomenon @xcite .",
    "thus , one has to investigate the effect of rise and fall of the critical temperature @xmath3 near the van hove singularities very carefully , simultaneously , taking into account the effects of disorder .",
    "clearly disorder reduces the critical temperature @xmath3 by elimination of singularities in the density of states and , at the same time , by braking pairs .",
    "the present paper is the extension of the previous ones @xcite where the electron hopping was introduced only between nearest neighbour lattice sites . here following refs .",
    "we introduce the hopping to next nearest sites @xmath13",
    "( i.e. the ratio of hopping parameters @xmath14 , @xmath13 for ybacuo was suggested to be @xmath15 ) and investigate the effect of disorder on superconducting properties .    in the normal",
    "states the nonzero hopping to the next neighbour sites @xmath13 introduces the distortion of the fermi surface ( fig .",
    "1a ) which results in considerable changes in the electron density of states ( fig 1b ) . note , in case @xmath16 the central van hove singularity produces the stronger enhancement of the density of states ( @xmath17 for @xmath18 ) than for @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "moreover , the other van hove singularity associated with the bottom edge of the band @xmath20 creates the second peak in the density of states @xmath17 .",
    "thus , depending on the band filling , the additional electron hopping @xmath13 should have the effect on critical temperature @xmath3 , rising it to higher value . on the other hand , the distorted fermi surface with the stronger dependence on @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "1a ) seems to be less stable in the presence disorder as @xmath21 is not a good quantum number in disordered system .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the discussion starts with the extended attractive hubbard model defined on the square lattice which has the extended @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 wave order parameter solutions . than we shortly overview and classify various types of van hove singularities in electron density of states of one band model and their influence on the superconducting critical temperature @xmath3 . in section iii",
    "we investigate disordered superconducting systems and apply the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) for attractive hubbard model . the anderson theorem for non - magnetic impurity effect on isotropic @xmath0wave solutions and the pair  breaking effect in case of anisotropic pairing",

    "we do not wish to be very specific about the physical nature of the point defects represented by the site energies @xmath26 .",

    "note that for relatively low temperature van hove singularity is passing at @xmath101 ( figs .",
    "the lack of the particle - hole symmetry results in the shift of maximum value of @xmath3 to higher value of electron densities so in the optimal doping the superconductor is hole superconductor .",

    "its dependence on doping @xmath69 should be described rather by strongly changing function contrasting with the case of a constant density of states ( eq . [ eq14 ] ) where @xmath3 is simply @xmath140 .",
    "however it is also worthwhile to note that depending on the paring symmetry different van hove singularities can matter and because of non symmetric character of densities of states this effect is approximate . due to the this asymmetry we observe the additional shift of the optimal doping toward the center of a band .",
    "interestingly , different van hove singularities and corresponding shifts depend on solution type and the interaction range .",
    "eventually , an extend ed @xmath0wave solution appears to be an electron superconductor while @xmath1wave can be identified as hole one .",
    "the formulae for a critical temperature @xmath3 ( eqs .",
    "[ eq19 ] ) are based on the integral over the appropriate dos which posses van hove singularities .",
    "the effect of shift is stronger for smaller @xmath3 where hyperbolic tangent is smearing the function under integrals .",

    "it can be interpreted as leading to a natural cut - off @xmath142 around the chemical potential @xmath25 .",
    "note that if the temperature @xmath3 is small then the function @xmath143 is non zero in the narrow range of energies around @xmath25 only .",
    "in fact in the limit @xmath144 it tends to the dirac delta function ( @xmath145 ) and the cut - off is limited to the neighbourhood of the @xmath146 point .",

    "the gap equation at @xmath3 takes the simple form ( eq . [ eq34 ] ) .",

    "thus the effect of fermi surface distortion make place both of singularities very close to each other for some of band filling values @xmath269 both of singularities play important roles .",

    "@xmath125-wave symmetry is favored in case of the regions of band fillings @xmath69 with chemical potential @xmath25 near the saddle point singularity @xmath271 while extended @xmath0 wave pairing symmetry is more likely as far as the bottom edge singularity is concerned .",
    "interestingly , on account of the non - symmetricity of electron density of states the van hove scenario is fulfilled only approximately . here",
    "we observe a small interaction dependent , shift of the optimal doping electron concentration @xmath272 towards the center of the band . as a result of the above we",

    "strictly speaking a more realistic model should posses , beside an intersite attraction , a strong coulomb repulsion term . although the approximations we used in the present paper aimed to explain the effect of the van hove singularity in a presence of disorder in a weak coupling regime , the preliminary calculations using simultaneously slave boson technique and cpa @xcite seams to support the general arguments of the van hove singularities significance for superconducting cuprates conjectured here .",
