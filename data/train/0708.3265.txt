    "one of the underlying challenges in computational physics , notably in density functional theory , is the accurate and reliable treatment of many - body interactions in matter .",
    "the typical interaction - type that most electrons in solids experience is the coulomb interaction , and this is a pernicious one owing to its long - ranged nature .",
    "many of the difficulties in providing accurate numeric results for coulomb - interacting systems are the results of the long - range . it would be insightful and beneficial to the development of techniques that explicitly describe many - body systems if the coulomb interaction were instead a more local version .",
    "one such replacement , the contact interaction offers a powerful test case to probe specifically the many - body problem without long - range complications .",
    "this is particularly important in the analysis and formal improvement of practical methods of electronic structure theory such as hubbard theories and density functional ones . in this paper",
    ", we explore a simple model system of fermions that interact via a contact interaction .",
    "remarkably , the interacting quantum problem is shown here to reduce to a solvable system of integral equations . additionally , we extend developments in the density functional modeling of contact - interacting systems to the time - dependent domain .",
    "this work has implications both for the formal development of density - functional theory and for the practical numeric analysis of quasi 1d systems .",
    "the contact interaction can arise as a simplified form of 3d interactions in highly confined quasi-1d systems , experimentally realizable in 1d optical lattices @xcite . in these situations ,",
    "the contact term is a reasonable approximation to the interaction when the ratio of the interaction strength to the transverse well width is large .",
    "an additional approximation made is that the wave - function , although still 3d , factors into transverse and longitudinal components with the interaction only affecting the longitudinal part .",
    "this decomposition is valid when the transverse and longitudinal length scales are drastically different .",
    "we consider only the nontrivial longitudinal part .",
    "thus , the 3d interaction is replaced by a 1d one .",
    "admittedly , a more realistic reduction of the 3d coulomb problem to an effectively 1d one is widely debated , and , here , we have chosen a particular form partially motivated by the advantages it offers computationally .",
    "one of the computational advantages of the @xmath0-function interaction within the dft formalism is that the exchange and hartree density functionals are explicit functionals of the fermion density , a result implying that the local - density approximation ( lda ) to exchange is self - interaction free .",
    "thus , the functionals used for hartree and exchange represent the exact - exchange formalism ( exx ) .",
    "this locality of exx is not true for the long - ranged 3d coulomb interaction , and performing exx in 3d is a significantly more complicated endeavor . for the full lda in the 1d case ,",
    "any inaccuracies are caused by the mismodeling of correlation . in 3d",
    ", the inaccuracies are mixed between exchange and correlation due to the long - ranged nature of the coulomb potential .",
    "a notable example of a long - ranged correlation problem is the inability of the lda to localize single electrons on distant sites .",
    "hubbard theory , on the other hand , preserves this limit but sacrifices accuracy .",
    "for this reason and the clarifying simplicity of 1d models , the @xmath0-function model for 1d fermions has been considered in several recent studies .",
    "in particular , the introduction of a local density correlation functional has provided exceptionally accurate results for the ground - state of finite systems such as the diracium @xcite and the 1d analog of hooke s atom @xcite .",
    "a modified parameterization of the local density approximation ( lda ) has been used to describe interacting fermions in harmonic confining potentials @xcite .",
    "a time - dependent thomas - fermi theory has been used to predict the excited - state properties of a many - fermion system but did not amount to the kohn - sham ( ks ) formulation of dft @xcite .",
    "more general problems involving this contact interaction also have been studied recently @xcite .    in this paper",

    "large @xmath4 is the domain of validity of the hubbard model .",
    "this paper examines 2 of these regimes in detail : the small width double - well , @xmath34 , and the large range hopping scale , @xmath35 , both with @xmath36 .",
    "we note that in the former range , the separation between the wells is large enough to exceed the united atom limit yet still preserves the existence of at least two bound states .",
    "the latter case ( @xmath37 ) is the regime where hubbard theory is designed to be maximally valid .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we assume that @xmath36 .",
    "the two - site hubbard will be compared to the more general density functional and exact solutions .",
    "the hubbard model itself is important for the conceptual picture it provides and its role in the popular lda+u method @xcite .",

    "the hopping term is the projection , on one localized wave - function , of the kinetic energy operator acting on the other localized fermion wave - function : @xmath42 .",
    "note that we defined @xmath38 to be positive .",
    "this definition is chosen to reproduce the proper long range limit .",
    "traditionally , the @xmath38 term is fixed using non - orthogonal localized solutions .",
    "the difference is negligible in the large separation limit .",
    "for the small separation limit , our definition of @xmath38 gives a different result than the traditional hopping term .",

    "physically , the first excited singlet state at large separation , @xmath4 , corresponds to 2 fermions localized on one site .",
    "this is the diracium system and a distant empty site .",

    "the hubbard model is well trusted at large @xmath4 because its computational convenience and its facility with handling long - ranged ground - state correlations .",
    "lda does not handle these correlations , and even the exact solution method must be carefully formulated in this limit .",
    "in this section we generalize work , done by us and others , in ground - state density - functional theory to the time - dependent case .",
    "this extension requires several improvements upon the ground - state theory .",

    "the proposal of a local effective fermion measure based on ks orbitals , and 4 .",
    "the introduction of a new correlation functional that can properly describe spatially separated systems .",
    "the results can be found in equations [ echd ] , [ epsclda ] , [ localparam ] , and [ toggle ] respectively .    a general approach to find the ground - state energy and fermion density of dh2 is to use density functional theory ( dft ) . in ground - state dft , the details of the external potential are kept , but the many - body interaction is transformed to an effective local potential derived from the exchange - correlation density functional @xcite .",
    "given the exact exchange - correlation functional , dft would return the exact results for the total energy and density . in practice , this exchange - correlation contribution is approximated .",
    "an active area of research in the 3d case is to improve the accuracy and reliability of approximations to the exchange - correlation functional .    according to spin - density functional theory @xcite , the ground - state total energy is a functional of the particle density and the local magnetization . in this work ,",

    "the lda functionals in this paper include the exx formalism , so the analysis and results here will be useful in the next development stage of dft where exx - compatible correlation is considered in detail . in particular , since the interaction here is local , certain difficult - to - model long - range aspects of correlation will be isolated .",
    "for example , contact - interacting fermions will still exhibit spin - density waves and long - ranged entanglement , two problems extremely difficult to model using traditional density functional methods .",
