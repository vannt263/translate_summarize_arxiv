    "thanks to the fast experimental progress on cold atoms @xcite , where direct control over the parameters of the effective hamiltonian is available , many theoretical questions about out of equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems have been raised and started to be addressed . among them , we cite the problem of thermalization for an isolated system ( see e.g. @xcite ) the existence of long - lived out of equilibrium states ( see e.g. @xcite ) , dynamical transitions out of equilibrium @xcite , etc .    in this work",
    "we focus on the off - equilibrium dynamics induced by quantum quenches , _",
    "i.e. _ the evolution of an isolated quantum system after a sudden change of a parameter of the hamiltonian .",
    "this problem has been intensively studied these last years .",
    "it provides an useful idealization of the protocols followed in experiments , where the change of parameters takes instead place at finite rates .",
    "the literature on quantum quenches is already quite broad , see for example the reviews @xcite .",
    "one dimensional systems have been intensively studied by exact analytical and numerical methods .",
    "results for higher dimensional systems are instead scarcer ; the previous methods can not be applied and one has to resort to approximations of some kind .",
    "the ones that have been more used are the bogoliubov method @xcite , path integral saddle - point expansions @xcite , the large-@xmath0 limit @xcite and mean - field ( or large dimension ) approximations @xcite .",
    "interestingly , mean - field approaches revealed that quantum quenches may lead to out of equilibrium dynamical transitions .",
    "this was first found in the analysis of the fermionic hubbard model by time dependent dynamical mean field theory ( t - dmft ) in @xcite .",
    "later , a confirmation and explanation of this result was found by using a gutzwiller time - dependent ansatz in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we solved the bose hubbard model on a completely connected lattice and found a very similar dynamical transition at integer fillings .",
    "this was also noticed in the hard - core bose - hubbard model in a superlattice potential @xcite .",
    "finally , clues to argue that these dynamical transitions are generic even beyond mean - field were recently presented in @xcite by mapping the problem to the one of classical phase transitions in films .    in this article",
    "we first describe a generic approach to solve the dynamics of quenches in completely connected quantum models .",
    "then , we apply our method to the bose - hubbard model , the generalized jaynes - cummings model and the ising model in a transverse field .",
    "we find that the dynamical transition , discovered for the hubbard model , is a systematic dynamical effect present in completely connected systems characterized by a quantum phase transition in equilibrium . a shorter version of this work , that focused only on the bose - hubbard model , appeared in @xcite .",
    "in this article , we focus on the out of equilibrium dynamics in several completely connected models : the bose hubbard model ( bhm ) , the transverse field ising model ( i m ) and the jaynes - cumming model ( jcm ) .",
    "the reason for focusing on systems defined on completely connected graphs is that this allows one to study a well defined model and  at the same time  to obtain an approximate solution for finite dimensional lattices .",
    "indeed , such models are related to several approximations used in the literature . among the most known ones",
    ", we cite the limit of infinite dimensions for models defined on a hyper - cubic @xmath1-dimensional lattice and the gutzwiller ansatz , a widespread method to obtain mean field equations .",
    "actually , in the case of completely connected models , the gutzwiller ansatz can be shown to be exact by using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "we shall focus on out of equilibrium dynamics induced by a quantum quench .",
    "this procedure is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be the quantum hamiltonian , which depends on a coupling @xmath3 .",
    "the system is prepared in its ground state @xmath4 at some coupling @xmath5 . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the system is driven out of equilibrium in a controlled fashion , tuning the coupling @xmath7 in time according to a predefined procedure . except for quasistatic procedures ,",
    "often called `` adiabatic '' , the wave function becomes different from the ground state @xmath8 .",
    "we call _ sudden quench _ the procedure in which the coupling is suddenly switched to a final value @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "as we shall show , the quantum dynamics in a completely connected system can be solved by mapping the unitary evolution onto an effective model undergoing newtonian dynamics .",
    "this is a drastic simplification which is possible thanks to the symmetry of the completely connected hamiltonian under any permutation of sites .",
    "we restrict our analysis to cases where @xmath11 is the ground state at some coupling @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is also symmetric under permutation of sites and since both the initial state and the hamiltonian are symmetric , the generic unitary evolution takes place in the sector of symmetric states only . in this subspace",
    ", the states are parametrized using a few local macroscopic observables .",
    "the unitary evolution can then be written as a schrdinger equation in the symmetric space , which involve an effective @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of sites of the system .",
    "thanks to this property , at the thermodynamic limit , the entire dynamics of the system can be encoded in the one of few macroscopic variables , which undergo an effective classical hamiltonian evolution .",
    "we first apply this approach to the bose - hubbard model , our main interest because of its applicability to cold atom experiments . in this case , it is the onsite repulsion @xmath14 that plays the role of the coupling @xmath3 . in a first stage",
    "we make the additional assumption that the number of bosons per site is less or equal to @xmath15 . the average superfluid order after the quench is a non - monotonous function of @xmath16 .",
    "actually , it decays logarithmically to zero at some special values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for these special quenches ,",
    "the superfluid order relaxes exponentially to zero .",
    "we call this peculiar feature a dynamical transition .",
    "surprisingly , the microcanonical equilibrium characterized by same energy , towards which the system would relax on large times if it were able to thermalize .",
    "] , has non - zero superfluid order .",
    "thus , this transition is a purely _ dynamical _ phenomenon , which has nothing to do with the fact that the superfluid order vanishes in the high temperature phase .",
    "we extend our analysis to @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the effective dynamics involves @xmath20 degrees of freedom , and the classical trajectories can be either regular or chaotic .",
    "apart from this difference , the dynamical transition is found to be qualitatively unchanged and the quantitative differences with @xmath15 are small .    finally , we focus on two other systems , for which some out of equilibrium properties have already been studied , a generalized jaynes - cummings model @xcite , and the ising model in a transverse field @xcite .",
    "we apply our formalism to both systems and show that also in these cases there is a dynamical transition for sudden quenches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ models ] , we briefly describe the three considered models . in section [ general ] , we describe how the effective classical dynamics can be derived for an arbitrary hamiltonian .",
    "then in section [ special ] , we derive the classical dynamics for the bose - hubbard model with truncation @xmath15 , and analyze quenches and the dynamical transition in section [ quenches ] .",
    "the general case @xmath21 is considered in section [ more ] . the effective dynamics and quench properties of the generalized jaynes - cummings model are described in section [ jaynes ] , and in section [ ising ] for the ising model .",
    "section [ discussion ] and [ conclusion ] contain discussions and possible extensions of our work .",
    "[ gutzwiller ] is devoted to prove that the same effective dynamics is recovered with a gutzwiller ansatz wave function , and in [ wkb_expansion ] the wkb eigenstates of the completely connected model are discussed .",
    "the bose - hubbard lattice model has regained a lot of interest recently since it can be realized and studied in experiments on cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of its completely connected version , suited to describe the limit @xmath22 of the lattice model , reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators , satisfying @xmath26 = \\delta_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath27 .",
    "the first term is an on - site repulsion between bosons , the second is a tunneling term , of amplitude @xmath28 , and rescaled by the volume @xmath13 ( number of sites ) .",
    "this rescaling is needed to obtain a well - defined thermodynamic limit @xmath29 .",
    "the limit of infinite dimensions that is equivalent to this model is obtained by taking a coupling @xmath30 for a bhm defined on a @xmath1-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice .",
    "this model undergoes a quantum phase transition at _ commensurate _ fillings : @xmath31 with @xmath32 integer .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the phase diagram . notice that since we consider the dynamical behavior , the number of particles is fixed because it corresponds to a quantity conserved by the dynamics . in consequence",
    "we shall discuss the phase diagram in terms of the density and not the chemical potential , as it is instead done usually .",
    "let us focus first on cases where the number of particles per site is an integer . to grasp why",
    "there is a quantum phase transition , it is helpful to compare the ground state in the two limits @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 . in the first case ,",
    "the ground state is diagonal in the occupation number @xmath36 .",
    "it remains the same for all @xmath37 , and is called a mott insulator .",
    "it is incompressible because adding or removing a boson requires an energy of the order of @xmath14 . in the second case , @xmath38 ,",
    "the ground state is akin to corrections . ]",
    "a product of coherent states @xmath39 . for @xmath38 , and also moderate values of @xmath14 , the ground state is superfluid and compressible .",
    "the usual order parameter @xmath40 is zero because the density is fixed , hence the appropriate parameter is the off - diagonal long range order measured by @xmath41 . in the completely connected model , all distances @xmath42 between two different sites",
    "are equal to @xmath43 .",
    "this is the largest distance in the problem . in consequence",
    "one can define ] : @xmath44 , the order parameter @xmath45 vanishes and the ground state becomes a mott insulator .",
    "this is the mott - superfluid quantum phase transition . for non - integer fillings ,",
    "the system is instead always superfluid and compressible as it can be understood considering perturbation around the @xmath46 limit . at non zero temperature",
    ", there is a second order phase transition from the superfluid phase to a bose gas at a critical temperature @xmath47 .      the second model that we consider is the generalized jaynes - cummings model studied in @xcite , which describes @xmath0 distinguishable two - level systems in interaction with a single quantized electromagnetic mode .",
    "it is useful in various contexts , and has been suggested as a qualitative description of the bec / bcs crossover in fermionic condensates , of molecular magnetism and of the formation of dimers by pairing of two bosons .",
    "recently , new experiments in the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite are realizations of the dicke hamiltonian @xcite , which can be mapped onto the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian if the `` rotating wave approximation '' is made .",
    "the dynamics of sweeps , starting from an empty bosonic mode , was studied in @xcite using quasiclassical approximations and the truncated wigner approximation . here , we describe the dynamics of sudden quenches from the broken symmetry phase .",
    "the model is defined as follows .",
    "there is one bosonic @xmath48= 1 $ ] degree of freedom  the electromagnetic mode  and one su(2 ) spin @xmath49 .",
    "the spin degree of freedom keeps track of the number of excited two - level systems , @xmath50 . with @xmath51 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath52 it includes a potential energy for bosons ( @xmath53 ) , for the spin ( @xmath54 ) , and a coupling @xmath55 between the two .",
    "each time a boson is lost , a two - level system is excited , and reciprocally : the quantity @xmath56 is conserved by the dynamics .",
    "it is thus possible to define @xmath57 such that up to a constant term one finds : @xmath58 in the following we take @xmath59 and consider @xmath3 in units of @xmath55 , and the time in units of @xmath60 .",
    "we consider the regime @xmath61 ( which can be reduced to @xmath62 ) , for which there is a quantum phase transition . at @xmath63 ,",
    "the system is in the _ normal _ ground state @xmath64 if @xmath65 and is in the _ super - radiant _ ground state for @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "this is the super - radiance quantum phase transition .",
    "this transition is the consequence of the competition between the two terms in the hamiltonian : the first one favors removing bosons ( if @xmath68 ) , whereas the second plays the role of a kinetic energy and it can lower the energy if the bosons modes are filled , see section [ jaynes ] . as for the bose - hubbard model , there is a finite temperature phase transition at @xmath69 , above which the super - radiant phase disappears .",
    "notice that this phase transition is usually studied in the canonical / microcanonical ensemble , whereas here it is more natural to focus on given value of @xmath70 since this quantity conserved by the dynamics .",
    "the ising model in a transverse field is a paradigm of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of its completely connected version reads @xmath71 where @xmath28 is the ferromagnetic coupling and @xmath72 the transverse field . for simplicity , we set @xmath73 , measure @xmath72 in units of @xmath28 and time in units of @xmath74",
    ". the hamiltonian can be written using a single spin @xmath75 and reads @xmath76 the large @xmath0 limit corresponds to the large spin @xmath49 limit , which is also the classical limit .",
    "the ground state is found , minimizing the corresponding classical hamiltonian @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the minimum is at @xmath78 , and for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , which is a _",
    "ferromagnetic _ ground state , in which the spins align toward the @xmath81-axis . for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the ground state is called _ quantum paramagnet _ , because it is unoriented in the @xmath81-basis @xmath84 , @xmath85 . the quantum phase transition from z - ferromagnet to quantum paramagnet takes place at @xmath86 . starting from the ferromagnetic ground state and increasing the temperature the system undergoes a second - order phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath87 .",
    "in the following , we show how the dynamics induced by quantum quenches , in arbitrary completely connected models , can be mapped onto an effective classical hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "as already stated , any model defined on a completely connected lattice has a hamiltonian which is symmetric under any permutation of sites .",
    "thus , one expects that the ground state of the model is _ also _ site permutation symmetric .",
    "we shall study quenches starting from the ground state of the system .",
    "since the site permutation symmetry is conserved by the unitary evolution , the dynamics only takes place into the subspace of symmetric wave functions .",
    "this is a drastic simplification , because symmetric states can be described using a few variables only .    to clarify this point in a concrete but simple case ,",
    "let us see what these variables are for the bose - hubbard model , with the additional constraint that there are @xmath88 or less bosons per site .",
    "first , remark that given a particular fock state @xmath89 , the linear combination of every possible site permuted fock state is a site permutation symmetric state @xmath90 .",
    "this new state is completely characterized by the fraction @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 of sites with @xmath94 , @xmath43 and @xmath95 bosons respectively , and we call it @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a shorthand for all variables . since the fock states form a basis of generic states , the @xmath98 states form a basis of the symmetric sector . in order to express the schrdinger evolution in this basis",
    ", we have to compute the transitions elements @xmath99 . typically , only few transitions @xmath100 are allowed , with @xmath101 a vector of integers .",
    "for example in the bose - hubbard model , the matrix elements of the hamiltonian connect states that differs by one boson jump .",
    "thus @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 can only differ by @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "for example , after a jump @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this transition is labeled @xmath108 . moreover ,",
    "the reverse move is a transition characterized by @xmath109 , with same amplitude @xmath110 at dominant order in @xmath13 .",
    "thanks to the `` locality '' of transition elements between symmetric states , the schrdinger equation in the symmetric basis @xmath111 takes a simple form .",
    "the schrdinger equation projected on @xmath112 reads @xmath113 . denoting the diagonal transition element @xmath114",
    ", we get @xmath115 where we made use of @xmath116 with an implicit summation over the index @xmath117 .",
    "strikingly , the schrdinger equation involves an effective @xmath118 , thus the regime of interest @xmath29 corresponds to the _",
    "classical regime_. furthermore , for the ground state , the initial wave function is a narrow wave packet of width @xmath119 ( this general property is discussed in more detail for the bose - hubbard model in section [ classical_evolution_of_packet ] ) .",
    "thus , by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , we expect that momentum fluctuations are proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "therefore the evolution of the wave - packet can be fully described in the thermodynamic limit by its average ( or center ) @xmath121 and average momentum @xmath122 .",
    "both quantities evolve following a classical hamiltonian dynamics obtained from the quantum one by replacing @xmath123 and @xmath124 : @xmath125 @xmath126 = d(x ) - 2 \\sum_{m } w_{m}(x ) \\cos(m_i p_i)\\ ] ] the classical hamiltonian evolution of the variables @xmath127 and @xmath128 yields the evolution of the wave packet after the quantum quench , and give access to all observables as a function of time .",
    "a more careful analysis is performed in section [ rigorous ] and fully supports this picture .    as a conclusion ,",
    "the analysis of quench dynamics in connected models is tractable , and takes the form of an effective classical hamiltonian evolution .",
    "the initial condition is provided by the ground state values of @xmath129 at the initial coupling @xmath17 .",
    "the sudden quantum quench dynamics is then described by the classical dynamics of @xmath130 induced by the effective hamiltonian @xmath131 , with initial conditions @xmath129 .",
    "in the following , we study the bose - hubbard model with two or less bosons per site .",
    "we derive explicitly the effective classical hamiltonian in section [ bose - hubbard_hamiltonian ] .",
    "the nature of the ground state , in particular the peaking of the wave packet when @xmath133 and the quantum phase transition , are discussed in section [ classical_evolution_of_packet ] .",
    "a more thorough derivation of the effective hamiltonian dynamics is presented in section [ rigorous ] .",
    "finally , we conclude by describing the phase space of effective trajectories in section [ types ] .      in this section , the method sketched above",
    "is applied to the bose - hubbard model with truncation @xmath134 .",
    "this restriction is well - suited to derive analytical expressions , and preserves the main features of the model , such as the mott insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition .",
    "the case of a larger number of bosons per site is considered in section [ more ] .",
    "the results remain qualitatively the same .",
    "the symmetric states are written under the form @xmath135 . since the total number of sites",
    "@xmath136 is fixed , and the overall density of bosons @xmath137 is conserved by the dynamics , the symmetric states can be labeled by one variable only .",
    "choosing @xmath92 as such a variable , the symmetric normalized wave functions are denoted @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 means the sum over fock states of fixed fraction @xmath92 . in the following for simplicity of notation we drop the subindex one and use @xmath97 instead of @xmath92 . note that contrary to the previous paragraph , @xmath97 is now just a number and not a vector .",

    "let s first expand the eigenvalue equation at lowest order in @xmath102 : @xmath169 since the kinetic term has a factor @xmath170 in front , the ground state corresponds to the minimum of @xmath171 and small quantum fluctuations around it .",

    "the ground state of the quantum hamiltonian corresponds to the global minimum of the effective hamiltonian , given by @xmath180 .",

    "it is easy to check that @xmath183 where @xmath184 ( note that @xmath185 ) . in the thermodynamic limit , the mott insulator ground state is @xmath186 .",

    "@xmath190 is proportional to the intensive kinetic energy , and can be computed using the identity @xmath191 .",
    "it is the order parameter for the transition : it is positive in the superfluid phase and vanishes in the mott insulating one .      in the following",
    "we show in detail how the classical hamiltonian dynamics emerges from the quantum evolution of symmetric states in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity",
    "we consider the situation of section [ special ] , where @xmath192 , but the argument is more general .",
    "the schrdinger equation reads @xmath193 a ground state wave function is a wave packet characterized by a small width of the order of @xmath119 as shown in section [ classical_evolution_of_packet ] .",
    "the width broadens after a long time , which diverges with @xmath13 . on times that do not diverge in the thermodynamic limit",

    "the width of the packet can also be evaluated .",
    "it is related to the separation in time of two classical trajectories initially separated by the width of the packet . when the effective dynamics is one dimensional , the classical hamiltonian is integrable and periodic orbits separate linearly in time . in this case , since trajectories start from an initial distance @xmath119 , the typical time of separation is @xmath222 .",

    "before concluding , two points need to be addressed further : ( 1 ) the possible link between dynamical transitions and equilibrium quantum phase transitions and ( 2 ) the pro and cons of our approach concerning the physics of finite dimensional systems .    * in three examples , we found that dynamical transitions occur in systems characterized by a quantum equilibrium phase transition . therefore , despite the fact that the dynamical transition is not directly related to the equilibrium one , as we stressed before , it is natural to wonder whether instead its _ existence _ is related to it . in support of this , if one studies the completely connected bose - hubbard model in a parameter regime ( non unitary fillings ) where there is no _ equilibrium _ quantum phase transition then one finds that there is no dynamical transition either .",
    "actually , we found the very same phenomenon in all models we studied , and this was also noticed for the fermionic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "we certainly can not address this issue in general , also because it is still far from clear what `` the dynamical transition '' is beyond mean - field theory .",
    "we shall instead endeavor to provide a partial answer at the mean - field level .",
    "generically , we observe that in all models we studied , there is a regime in which the symmetric state ( the mott insulator , the paramagnet , etc . ) is not the ground state but it plays the role of an excited metastable state that can trap the system for an infinite time .",
    "this gives rise to the dynamical transition .",
    "if the effective motion is one dimensional , this state is absorbing and belongs to a separatrix .",
    "if the effective motion has two or more degrees of freedom , this state seems to belong to an unstable manifold .",
    "thus , it appears that the singularity at the dynamical transition is a result of this singular trajectory , which in turn is a consequence of the existence of a quantum phase transition .",
    "a physical argument to support this idea is the following . for a quench from the unbroken symmetry phase to the broken symmetry phase in completely connected model , the dynamical evolution",
    "is expected to be very slow .",
    "the reason is that the symmetry must break up and the order must develop starting from this point .",
    "this , however , is a local phenomenon , for example due to domain growth in finite dimensions , and therefore generically absent in completely connected models , except on times diverging with the system size : indeed , in our examples , we find that the typical time scale to depart from the initial value @xmath406 is of the order of @xmath407 .",
    "the point is that this slow trajectory is precisely the _ time reversal _ of the singular trajectory that is responsible for the dynamical transition .",
    "to summarize , the existence of a quantum phase transition implies the existence of slow trajectories .",
    "they correspond to the escape from the symmetry unbroken state .",

    "* unlike pertubative approaches , it can describe the existence of dynamical transitions * , and phenomena related to global observables .",
    "the general purpose of this article was twofold .",
    "first , we described a method to study the quantum quench dynamics of generic completely connected models , providing a mapping to effective classical dynamics .",
    "there are two reasons for considering completely connected models . in some cases , such as in the generalized jaynes - cummings model , and the dicke model",
    ", they provide the correct physical description . in others , such as the transverse field ising model or the bose - hubbard model ,",
    "they lead to an approximative treatment of finite dimensional systems . in the latter case ,",
    "the range of validity of the approximation is possibly limited to short times only .",
    "our second aim was to study and to reveal the existence of out of equilibrium dynamical transitions induced by quantum quenches . in agreement with other works @xcite we showed that within the mean - field approximation dynamical transitions occur in quenches from the broken symmetry phase to other regions of the broken symmetry phase and that this is a quite generic phenomenon for systems that display a quantum phase transition at equilibrium .    clearly , a main and pressing question is to understand what this transition is really , beyond mean - field theory .",
    "does it become a cross - over in finite dimensions ? if it remains a bona fide transition , what are its critical properties ? in the @xmath408 bhm , a non - monotonic behavior of the propagation velocity as a function of @xmath18 has been found in @xcite by t - dmrg . this could well be a signature of a cross - over related to the dynamical transition found in mean - field .",
    "an exact diagonalization study of hard core bosons in @xmath409 suggests the existence of a cross - over or a singularity of the revival time after a quantum quench @xcite . from the analytic point of view",

    "an argument for the occurrence of dynamical transitions beyond mean field is given in @xcite , within an imaginary time path integral formalism .",

    "g. biroli acknowledges partial financial support from anr famous .",
    "the previous analysis , based on the symmetry between sites , seems to be related to completely connected models only .",
    "it is instead much more robust than it looks , since it is actually equivalent to the time dependent gutzwiller ansatz .",
    "the latter can be formulated as a mean field approximation for a finite dimensional model : it consists in providing a trial wave function dependent on some physical parameters that are chosen through a maximization procedure . in its equilibrium version",
    ", the estimated ground state is simply found minimizing the energy .",
    "the dynamical formulation is a bit more elaborated . for clarity , we show here how to build it for the case @xmath15 only .",
    "the following is an adapted version of the formulation developed in @xcite .",
    "let us define first the `` full state '' @xmath411 , and let @xmath412 be the projector on site @xmath413 on the state @xmath414 , where @xmath415 .",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz wave function is a trial wave function with @xmath416 real , time dependent parameters @xmath417 , @xmath418 : @xmath419 note that for simplicity we dropped the site index .",
    "the @xmath420 are the projector average : @xmath421 .",
    "as we shall see , they will turn out to coincide with the fraction of sites with @xmath32 bosons . obviously , because this is only a trial wave function , it can not satisfy exactly the time evolution : i.e. @xmath422 .",
    "however , one can enforce it in an approximate way .",
    "this allows one to obtain the time evolution of @xmath417 and @xmath418 .",
    "we impose the following constraints :    * the projectors in the heisenberg representation @xmath423 satisfy on average the heisenberg equation of evolution @xmath424 $ ] .",
    "this amounts to computing the average of @xmath425 in the schrdinger picture @xmath426 using @xmath427| \\psi \\rangle\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] * the energy is conserved @xmath428 .",
    "let us call @xmath429 =   \\langle \\psi | \\hat{h } | \\psi \\rangle$ ] the energy as a function of the parameters .",
    "the evolution can also be written , using the explicit form of @xmath430 : @xmath431| \\psi \\rangle = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_l}\\langle \\psi | \\hat{h } | \\psi \\rangle \\\\   & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{h}[x_l , p_l]}{\\partial p_l } \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] this evolution is very reminiscent of the first hamilton equation of motion .",
    "furthermore , the conservation of energy @xmath432}{\\partial p_l } \\dot{p_l } + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{h}[x_l , p_l]}{\\partial x_l } \\dot{x_l}=0 $ ] leads to the second hamilton equation : @xmath433}{\\partial x_l}\\ ] ]    as a consequence , the gutzwiller ansatz wave function is indeed equivalent to an effective classical hamiltonian evolution of the variables @xmath434 and @xmath435 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath429 = \\langle \\psi | \\hat{h } | \\psi \\rangle [ x_l , p_l]$ ] must be computed for the model at hand , and is indeed the same as the one discussed in section [ general ] .",
    "for instance , for the bose - hubbard model with truncation @xmath15 , one recovers .",
    "using a wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation @xcite , eigenstates of the schrdinger equation can be found in the limit of large @xmath13 .",
    "to do so , we write the eigenstates @xmath436 within the wkb approximation .",
    "the derivation is standard , one looks for stationary solutions of the form @xmath437 of the equation , at dominant order in @xmath13 .",
    "one finds @xmath438 where @xmath249 is a normalization constant , @xmath244 is the energy , @xmath439 satisfies the implicit equation @xmath440 , and @xmath91 is the left turning point of the classical trajectory of energy @xmath244 .    using this expression , we can draw a parallel between the eigenstate @xmath436 and the effective classical trajectories of energy @xmath244 .",
    "for an observable @xmath441 , the average reads    @xmath442    in the second line , we refer to the effective classical motion @xmath443 , and the average @xmath444 is the average over the effective classical trajectory of @xmath445 over one peridod . in words , we found that in the semi classical regime , the average over a quantum stationary state of energy @xmath244 is given by the average over one period of the classical trajectory of same energy @xmath244 .",
    "although this result is not often mentioned , this is a direct consequence of the wkb expression of the wave function ."
