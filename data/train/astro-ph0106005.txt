    "as surviving relics from the epoch of galaxy formation , globular clusters ( gcs ) provide important insights into the processes which shaped their present day host galaxies .",
    "the observed properties of gcs in giant elliptical galaxies  such as their total numbers , chemical abundances and spatial distributions  have been used alternatively to argue for a wide diversity of formation processes including dissipative ( monolithic ) collapse , spiral - spiral mergers ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) , multi - modal star formation histories caused by galactic winds ( harris , harris & mclaughlin 1998 ) , and dissipationless hierarchical growth ( ct , marzke & west 1998 ; ct et al . 2000 ) .",
    "there is , however , one important piece of observational evidence which has been almost entirely absent in such discussions  the _ dynamical properties _ of the gcs . due to the faintness of even the most luminous gcs in nearby giant elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the requisite spectroscopic observations are extremely challenging , and it is only recently that radial velocities for significant samples of clusters have been accumulated in a handful of galaxies ( e.g. , cohen & ryzhov 1997 ; sharples et  al . 1998 ; zepf et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "m87 , the incipient cd galaxy near the dynamical center of the virgo cluster , offers an ideal testing ground for the various formation scenarios .",
    "it has by far the most populous globular cluster system ( gcs ) of any nearby galaxy ( e.g. , n@xmath11 @xmath12 13,500 ; mclaughlin et al .",
    "1994 ) , and a wealth of observational data has been accumulated for both the galaxy itself , and the surrounding virgo cluster . such material includes numerous analyses of the photometric properties and spatial distribution of m87 gcs ( @xmath13 . , strom et al . 1981 ; mclaughlin et al . 1994 ; geisler , lee & kim 2001 ) , surface brightness profiles for the galaxy light ( de vaucouleurs & nieto 1978 ; carter & dixon 1978 ) , stellar dynamical studies of the central regions of m87 ( van der marel 1994 ) , photometric and radial velocity surveys of surrounding virgo cluster galaxies ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1985 ; binggeli , popescu & tammann 1993 ; girardi et al .",
    "1996 ) , and x - ray observations of the hot intracluster gas which fills the virgo gravitational potential well ( nulsen & bhringer 1995 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the m87 gcs have been addressed in several previous studies , albeit in varying levels of detail .",
    "early efforts ( huchra & brodie 1987 ; mould , oke & nemec 1987 ; mould et al .",
    "1990 ) were hampered by limited sample sizes : for example , the compilation of mould et al .",
    "( 1990 ) consisted of radial velocities for only 43 clusters .",
    "although these data were sufficient to provide a provisional mass estimate for m87 , and to hint at the presence of rotation in the gcs , it was shown by merritt & tremblay ( 1993 ) that this sample provides only weak constraints on the distribution of dark matter in the m87 halo . moreover , merritt & tremblay ( 1993 ) demonstrated that a measurement of the velocity anisotropy of gcs would require radial velocities for a minimum sample of several hundred clusters .    in a major observational effort ,",
    "cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) used the keck telescope to measure radial velocities for a total of 205 gcs surrounding m87 . using these data ,",
    "cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) found clear evidence for a rising velocity dispersion profile , and derived a total mass of @xmath14 within a volume of radius of @xmath15 kpc centered on m87 .",
    "an independent analysis of these velocities by kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) suggested that the m87 gcs is rotating rapidly at large radii : @xmath16 , @xmath17 km s@xmath3 beyond a projected radius of @xmath18 ( 20 kpc ) .",
    "this rapid rotation was subsequently confirmed by cohen ( 2000 ) who augmented her original radial velocity sample to include 17 additional clusters having @xmath19 .    while the amount of angular momentum implied by these results is large , there is emerging evidence from radial velocity surveys of planetary nebulae that giant elliptical galaxies may , as a class , rotate rapidly at large radii ( e.g. , hui et al .",
    "1995 ; arnaboldi et al . 1996 ; 1998 ) .",
    "an enormous amount of theoretical effort has been devoted to understanding the acquisition of angular momentum during galaxy formation : e.g. , via tidal torques in monolithic collapse scenarios ( peebles 1969 ) , or through the conversion of orbital and spin angular momentum of the progenitor galaxies in major ( heyl , hernquist & spergel 1996 ) and multiple ( weil & hernquist 1996 ) mergers .",
    "the angular momentum content of elliptical galaxies may thus constitute an important clue to their formation ; ultimately , the rotation properties of the chemically distinct gc populations in these galaxies may provide a powerful means of discriminating between the various formation models described above .    in this paper , we present a dynamical analysis of the m87 gcs using an improved and expanded sample of radial velocities . in addition , new washington ct@xmath20 photometry is used to derive metallicities for all program objects , and to investigate correlations between metallicity and dynamics by carrying out separate analyses for both the metal - rich and metal - poor gc populations .",
    "the database used in the analysis presented below is a subset of that which has been described in detail in a companion paper ( hanes et al .",
    "2001 ; hereafter paper i ) , so only a brief summary is given here .",
    "the reader is referred to paper i for a complete description of the sample properties , observational material and data reductions .",
    "one of our goals is to investigate the relationship between gc dynamics and metallicity , so we require homogeneous metallicity estimates for our sample of clusters",
    ". such information is most easily obtained from broadband photometry .",
    "unfortunately , although there have been numerous photometric studies of the m87 gcs , the large areal coverage of our radial velocity survey means that no single existing survey includes all of our program objects .",
    "for instance , the most extensive publsihed photometric survey of the m87 gcs remains that of strom et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , who presented photographic @xmath21 photometry for 1728 candidate gcs surrounding m87 .",
    "yet our sample includes many objects not included in the strom et al .",
    "( 1981 ) catalog : e.g. , objects that are at large radii , beyond the limits of their survey , or close to the galaxy center where crowding and background contamination is severe .",
    "therefore , as described in paper i , we have obtained deep , wide - field ccd images centered on m87 using the ctio and kpno 4 m telescope .",
    "imaging was carried out in washington c and t@xmath20 filters , since the long color baseline of the c@xmath22t@xmath20 index provides exceptional metallicity sensitivity ( see , e.g. , geisler , lee & kim 1996 ) .",
    "the photometric observations , calibrations , and reductions have been described briefly in paper i , while a more comprehensive description of the photometric properties of the m87 gcs based on these data will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( geisler , lee & kim 2001 ) .",
    "the sample of radial velocities we begin with here consists of data for 334 candidate and previously confirmed gcs .",
    "this number includes 145 measurements from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , 87 of which are for targets not observed in any of the previous surveys of huchra & brodie ( 1987 ) , mould , oke & nemec ( 1987 ) , mould et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) , or cohen ( 2000 ) .",
    "the total is down slightly from the full database of 352 objects in paper i , as we have discarded out of hand 12 targets for which we were unable to obtain unambiguous washington photometry ( i d nos .  881 , 5053 , 5055 , 5058 , 5064 , 5065 , 5066 , 5067 , 5071 , 9002 , 9051 , and 9052 from paper i ) ; five which were already identified by cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ; cr97 ) as galactic m stars ( i d nos .  38 , 87 , 782 , 1551 , 8001 ) ; and one object which turns out to be visibly non - stellar ( i d no .",
    "all measurements have been transformed onto common astrometric and radial velocity scales .",
    "we adopt the radial velocity and uncertainty from our own analysis for all targets observed at the cfht and transform all other data to this system as described in paper i. briefly , cluster candidates that were not observed at the cfht , but were observed at keck by cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) , are transformed onto our mos velocity scale according to : @xmath23 and assigned an uncertainty of @xmath24 km s@xmath3 , as recommended by these authors .",
    "objects measured neither by us nor by cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) , but by cohen ( 2000 ) , are transformed as : @xmath25 and given an uncertainty of @xmath26 km s@xmath3 .",
    "finally , to targets with velocities recorded _ only _ by mould et al .",
    "( 1987 ) or mould et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , we apply the correction : @xmath27 and adopt an uncertainty of @xmath28 km s@xmath3 .",
    "= 4.0truein      before proceeding with the dynamical analysis , it is important to first identify a sample of _ bona fide _",
    "m87 gcs . culling galactic field stars from the sample on the basis of radial velocity",
    "is not trivial since the relatively low systemic velocity of m87 ( @xmath29 km s@xmath3 ; van der marel 1994 ) and the high velocity dispersion of the gcs ( i.e. , @xmath30 km s@xmath3 ; see  3 ) make the correct choice of the low velocity cutoff problematical .",
    "we adopted a selection criterion of : @xmath31 this range is roughly symmetric about the mean velocity , @xmath32 km s@xmath3 , of the m87 gcs ( see  3 ) and is expected to exclude the vast majority of foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "we also imposed a selection on c@xmath22t@xmath20 color , discarding all objects which did not have colors within the range : @xmath33 the galactic foreground extinction in the direction of m87 , according to the dirbe maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) , is e(b - v ) = 0.022 mag , which corresponds to e(c@xmath22t@xmath20 ) = 0.045 mag ( secker et al .",
    "the metallicity calibration of geisler & forte ( 1990 ) suggests that this color selection will confine our sample to clusters having metallicities in range @xmath34 } \\le   1.0~{\\rm dex}$ ] , an interval which should encompass virtually all gcs in m87 ( e.g. , cohen , blakeslee & ryzhov 1998 ) .",
    "these selection criteria are illustrated in the upper panels of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the filled histograms in these two panels show the color and velocity distributions for all 334 candidate gcs with measured radial velocities and ( c@xmath22t@xmath20 ) colors .",
    "the dashed vertical lines in each panel show the adopted upper and lower selection limits .",
    "the dotted vertical line in the upper left panel shows our adopted dividing point between the metal - rich and metal - poor cluster populations : c@xmath22t@xmath20 = 1.42 .",
    "this color , which corresponds to a metallicity of @xmath35 } = -1.16 $ ] dex , was chosen based on the observed dip in the ( c@xmath22t@xmath20 ) distribution of the 2744 globular cluster candidates from the photometric catalog of geisler et al .",

    "= 4.0truein    the lower panel of figure  [ fig1 ] is a color - velocity diagram for these same objects .",
    "the dotted region shows the joint selection criteria on color and velocity , which together identify _ a total of 278 _ bona fide _ gcs_. of these , 161 are classified as `` blue '' ( c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath37 1.42 ) , or metal - poor , and 117 are considered `` red '' ( c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath38 1.42 ) , or metal - rich , for purposes of the analysis and modelling in   3 and 4 below .",
    "note that three objects ( i d nos .",
    "161 , 508 , and 1602 ) have radial velocities which are appropriate for m87 gcs , and yet have c@xmath22t@xmath20 colors which are far too red for true clusters ( i.e. , the inferred metallicities are typically several hundred times above solar ) .",
    "a fourth candidate ( i d no .",
    "5002 ) has a radial velocity near the mean of the gc sample , but an anomalously _ blue _ color .",
    "although we have no reason to suspect either the colors or the velocities of these objects , their nature is unclear and additional observations are clearly warranted , first and foremost to confirm our results ( particularly for strom 508 , an unresolved object which has a high radial velocity of @xmath39 km s@xmath3 but a very red color of c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath12 3.0 ) . in any event , all four are omitted from the following analysis .",
    "our innermost gc is projected to a distance of roughly @xmath40 from the center of m87 ( or about 2.6 kpc for our assumed distance of 15 mpc to the galaxy ) , while the outermost member of our sample lies at @xmath41 kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the distribution on the sky of all 278 _ bona fide _ gcs ( i.e. , those objects falling inside the dotted region in the lower panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the solid points on this plot denote 109 clusters which were observed by us at the cfht ; of these , 54 are entirely new measurements and the rest are repeat observations of gcs identified in one of the earlier studies .",
    "the open symbols refer to data taken from these other surveys , as indicated in the legend . the straight line running through the figure represents the photometric major axis of the m87 halo light ( oriented at 155@xmath42 east of north ; carter & dixon 1978 ) , the inner circle marks the effective radius of the galaxy light ( @xmath43 kpc [ de vaucouleurs & nieto 1978 ] ) , and the larger",

    "the azimuthal coverage of the composite radial - velocity database is far from complete , a situation which can significantly compromise any inferences on the kinematics of the gcs at such large galactocentric distances ( see below ) .",
    "in previous analyses of the kinematics of the m87 gcs , investigators have usually proceeded by fitting sine curves to their line - of - sight velocities , @xmath45 , as a function of projected azimuth , @xmath46 , in order to test for the presence of rotation and to measure its amplitude ( see cohen & ryzhov 1997 ; kissler - patig & gebhardt 1998 ; cohen 2000 ) we shall do the same here , but we pause first to clarify precisely what this assumes about the intrinsic velocity field of the gcs .      consider a _ spherical _",
    "gcs rotating about some axis , with an angular velocity @xmath47 that may be any axisymmetric function of position inside the galaxy .",
    "let @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denote the usual spherical coordinate system within the gcs , such that @xmath51 naturally identifies its rotation axis and its volume density @xmath52 is a function only of the galactocentric distance @xmath48 .",
    "also define a projected , circular coordinate system on the plane of the sky by the radial coordinate @xmath53 and the azimuth @xmath46 .",
    "the projected ( surface ) density of the gcs , @xmath54 , is , by the spherical hypothesis , a function of @xmath53 alone : @xmath55 however , its _ projected _ angular velocity , @xmath56 , which is just the average of @xmath47 along the line of sight through the gcs , may be a function of @xmath53 and @xmath46 both .",
    "assuming that the cluster system is viewed so that its rotation axis lies exactly in the plane of the sky and coincides with @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 by simple geometry ( see also fillmore 1986 ) .",
    "in addition to this , the angular velocities @xmath47 and @xmath56 are related to the linear velocities @xmath60  the intrinsic streaming , or rotation , velocity of the gcs  and @xmath61  the averaged component of velocity along the line of sight  in the usual way : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 where @xmath60 may still , in general , be any function of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "equation ( [ eq4 ] ) makes it clear that the apparent angular velocity will be a function of @xmath53 alone , @xmath65 , if @xmath47 is a function only of @xmath48 , i.e. , if the intrinsic angular velocity of the gcs is constant on spherical surfaces .",
    "this is just what is required , as equation ( [ eq5 ] ) shows explicitly , to have @xmath66 , and thus to justify fitting a sinusoid to our radial velocity data as a function of projected azimuth .",
    "it is worth emphasizing this point , even though it is not new ( see , e.g. , fillmore 1986 ) : the projected _ angular _ velocity of a spherical gcs is constant on circles in the plane of the sky  so that its linear velocity @xmath67 varies sinusoidally with projected azimuth @xmath46  if the intrinsic _ angular _ velocity is constant on spheres , such that @xmath68 .",
    "it happens that the variation of @xmath67 with @xmath46 in our sample of m87 gcs is adequately described , at all galactocentric radii , by a simple sine curve ( see below ) , and we interpret this as an indication that the angular velocity field of the gcs is stratified approximately on spherical surfaces : @xmath69 .",
    "this interpretation is somewhat different from that adopted by cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) , and apparently by kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) , who fit sines to their @xmath45 vs.  @xmath46 data and then posit that the intrinsic @xmath60 field of the gcs is stratified on _ cylinders_. the only way that both of these assumptions can be simultaneously true  that is , @xmath70 _ and _ @xmath71 depending on @xmath48 and @xmath49 only through the combination @xmath72  is in the special case of solid - body rotation , @xmath73 . this would , of course , require that @xmath74 .",
    "unfortunately , the data neither rule out this possibility nor present a compelling case for it ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig8 ] below ) .",
    "we shall return to the issue of possible solid - body rotation below , and in  5.7 for the specific case of the metal - poor gcs ( see figure  [ fig19 ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we assume that : ( 1 ) the gcs of m87 can be approximated as spherical [ @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; ( 2 ) its angular velocity field is constant on spheres [ @xmath77 and @xmath65 ] ; and ( 3 ) its rotation axis lies exactly in the plane of the sky and coincides with @xmath57 .",
    "we are then able to investigate the rotation of the gcs by fitting our observed radial velocities with the function @xmath79 where @xmath80 ( measured , as @xmath46 is , in degrees east of north ) , locates the gcs rotation axis , and where the rotation amplitude @xmath81 can in principle be any function of projected galactocentric radius @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the dependence of radial velocity on azimuth for our full sample of 278 gcs in m87 , for our subsample of 161 blue clusters ( defined by 0.80 @xmath36 c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath36 1.42 ) , and for our subsample of 117 red gcs ( 1.42 @xmath36 c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath36 2.35 ) .",
    "overlaid on the data in each case is the best - fit sine . for the full sample",
    ", we find a rotation amplitude of @xmath82 km s@xmath3 , where the quoted errors refer to 90% confidence intervals .",
    "this rotation amplitude is somewhat larger than the value of @xmath83 km s@xmath3 estimated by cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) , although still consistent given the rather large uncertainties .",
    "the best - fit position angle of the rotation axis for the full sample is @xmath84 e of n. the photometric minor axis of the underlying galaxy light is similarly oriented to @xmath85 ( carter & dixon 1978 ) , a correspondence that is consistent with our simplifying assumption that we are viewing the gcs essentially edge - on .",
    "we separately find @xmath86 km s@xmath3 and @xmath87 for the entire sample of metal - poor clusters , and @xmath88 km s@xmath3 and @xmath89 for the metal - rich sample .",
    "the dispersion of velocities about the best - fitting sine is @xmath90 km s@xmath3 for the full sample , @xmath91 km s@xmath3 for the metal - poor clusters , and @xmath92 for the metal - rich clusters .",
    "= 4.0truein    we conclude , therefore , that rotation is present in the m87 gcs and is significant at a high confidence level , for the blue and red subsystems alike .",
    "moreover , the metal - poor and metal - rich clusters in our sample have : ( 1 ) essentially identical rotation amplitudes ; ( 2 ) rotation axes that coincide with one another and with the photometric minor axis of the galaxy ; and ( 3 ) similar fractions of their total kinetic energy stored in rotation [ @xmath93 in each case ] .",
    "thus , within the observational uncertainties , there is no obvious difference between the _ global _ kinematics of the two subsystems .",
    "we caution , however , that this is just a thumbnail sketch of the kinematics , averaged over the full range of galactocentric radii spanned by the gcs in our radial - velocity sample . as was stressed above , the quantity @xmath81 can , in principle , be a function of projected radius  as might be the rotation axis @xmath80 and the dispersion of the line - of - sight velocities . while figure  [ fig3 ] is useful as a rough summary of the situation , it is necessarily limited .",
    "= 4.0truein    thus , we sort our gcs into a number of distinct circular annuli and fit sine curves separately to @xmath45 vs.  @xmath46 in each annulus to investigate possible radial variations in the kinematics of the total , blue , and red cluster systems . table [ tab1 ] lists the results of this exercise and includes full details of the global kinematics discussed just above .",
    "the first column of the table defines the annulus in question ( with @xmath94 kpc for a distance of 15 mpc to m87 ) , the second and third columns gives the median radius ( in arcseconds and kpc ) of the clusters in that radial bin , and the fourth records the number of objects in it .",
    "the fifth and six columns then give the mean line - of - sight velocity of the clusters ( ignoring any rotation that might be present , and estimated using the robust , biweight measure of `` location '' discussed by beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) and the dispersion of their velocities about this mean value ( i.e. , the biweight `` scale '' of beers et al .",
    "the uncertainties on these values , and on all quantities in table [ tab1 ] , define a 90% confidence interval .",
    "they are estimated using a numerical bootstrap procedure in which 1000 artificial datasets are constructed by randomly choosing @xmath54 clusters from among the actual data in an annulus .",
    "the mean and dispersion are computed for each of these 1000 trial datasets , the results are sorted , and the values corresponding to the 5th and 95th percentiles are identified ; uncertainties are then defined as the offsets between these values and the actual @xmath67 and @xmath95 computed from the read data .",
    "columns 7 , 8 , and 9 of table [ tab1 ] give the rotation parameters in each annulus , for each of our gc subsamples .",

    "we slide a bin of fixed radial width @xmath247 kpc through the gcs , centering the bin at the position of each of our measured gcs in turn and computing the kinematics ( including bootstrap estimates of confidence intervals ) for all clusters lying within @xmath248 of that point .",
    "we begin at small projected radii when the number of clusters per bin first exceeds 15 ( so that the fits can be usefully constrained ) and we stop at large @xmath53 when the sample size per bin drops below this limit .",
    "= 4.0truein    = 4.0truein    = 4.0truein    clearly ,",
    "most of the points plotted in these figures are not statistically independent  only points separated by at least the full @xmath249 kpc ( the size of the horizontal bar drawn in each middle panel ) can be  and we do not attempt any sort of formal fits to these profiles . nevertheless , this procedure is useful since it provides a more detailed ( albeit smoothed ) view of radial trends than can be had with a single binning such as that in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is also important to note that this method of smoothing the data is different than that employed by kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) and cohen ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors opt instead to fit the kinematics in a series of annuli that always enclose the same number of data points , and which therefore ( because neither the intrinsic spatial distribution of the gcs nor the observational sampling of it is uniform ) have a _ variable _ radial width ( for an illustration of this point , see figure 2 of cohen 2000 ) .",
    "our approach avoids the nontrivial difficulty of interpreting data that have been smoothed by different amounts from point to point , and it yields a more accurate , though necessarily less precise , depiction of radial variations in kinematics at the low - density , large - radius limits of our gc sample .    the mean velocity in figure  [ fig5 ] , which makes no allowance or corrections for rotation , shows no significant variations with radius until roughly @xmath250 kpc .",
    "the sharp apparent rise in @xmath244 at this radius is due  as figure  [ fig2 ] and the bottom of figure  [ fig4 ] both show , and as romanowsky & kochanek ( 2000 ) also suggested  to sparse sampling of a population that shows significant rotation : the few gcs in our radial - velocity sample at these large radii have been drawn mostly from positions around the photometric major axis of m87 ( at 155@xmath42 east of north ) , where the rotation produces line - of - sight velocities furthest from the true systemic velocity of the galaxy and the gcs . fitting a sine curve to quantify the rotation at every radius takes this effect into account , and a plot of @xmath251 vs.  @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "[ [ eq6 ] ] ) is essentially flat , and consistent with a constant @xmath252 km s@xmath3 .",

    ", the red clusters may be dynamically somewhat `` hotter '' than the blue clusters in m87 , and the situation may be reversed at larger radii . as was mentioned above , however , in connection with table [ tab1 ] , these apparent differences are not statistically significant .",
    "however , in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , cohen & ryzhov 1997 ) , we do see evidence for a rising velocity dispersion towards larger radii  a trend that is more clearly established for our blue clusters than for the red ones .",
    "figures  [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ]  which show the rotation - axis position angle and apparent rotation amplitude as functions of projected radius in the m87 gcs  present the most substantial new result of this empirical part of our analysis and constitute a point of clear departure from earlier studies .",
    "these profiles were obtained by fitting equation ( [ eq6 ] ) to the @xmath243 data in our sliding radial bin , with @xmath252 km s@xmath3 held fixed but with @xmath80 and @xmath81 both allowed to vary .",
    "the most striking point relates to the blue clusters , which appear ( see figure  [ fig7 ] ) to rotate about the projected _ major _ axis of m87 ( @xmath255 e of n ) in the inner regions of the system , @xmath25618 kpc , but then switch to the the more conventional minor - axis rotation ( @xmath257 e of n ) that they show for @xmath258 kpc .",
    "given the smoothing kernel that we have applied to the data ( again , @xmath247 kpc , as illustrated in the middle panel of figure  [ fig7 ] ) , this 90-degree flip in @xmath80 seems to be almost instantaneous .",
    "it is probably no accident that it appears to coincide with the onset , at @xmath259 kpc , of the cd envelope in the starlight ( de vaucouleurs & nieto 1978 ; carter & dixon 1978 ) _ and _ the gcs of m87 ( mclaughlin , harris , & hanes 1993 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] also reveal that the rotation axis of the red clusters seems to show a gradual drift towards the photometric major axis of m87 for @xmath260 kpc before it `` corrects '' to a constant @xmath261 at larger radii .",
    "it is not clear , however , that this apparent difference in the small-@xmath53 behavior of the red and blue gcs is statistically significant  even at the 68% confidence level .",
    "we return to this issue in  5 below , where the two - dimensional rotation fields of the metal - poor and metal - rich gc samples are discussed within the context of the larger virgo cluster environment .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the rotation amplitude corresponding to each fitted value of @xmath80 in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "as was suggested above , it is difficult to discriminate between a flat rotation curve and one which rises with increasing radius .",
    "for instance , there is some evidence for an outward rise in @xmath81 for @xmath262 kpc , for the red and blue gcs alike , but this effect sets in roughly where the azimuthal coverage of our radial - velocity sample begins to decline ( see figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] ) , and it is significant at just the 68% confidence level .",
    "also , note that the dashed curve drawn in all three panels of figure  [ fig8 ] shows the circular velocity of the m87/virgo potential in which the gcs are orbiting [ @xmath263 ; see eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) below for our adopted mass model ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath81 appears to approach this limit at our largest sampled radii suggests that the sparser spatial coverage there may be biasing our results to some extent ; it may also provide some evidence that the m87 gcs is being viewed nearly edge - on , as any inclination correction is likely to be small if the apparent @xmath81 is already so near @xmath264 .",
    "one other point worthy of note in these @xmath81 profiles is the apparent dip to nearly 0 at radii @xmath26518 kpc .",
    "this may simply be an artifact of smoothing the data , rather than an indication of any real feature in the intrinsic velocity field of the gcs .",
    "since @xmath80 appears to change very suddenly by roughly 90@xmath42 at some radius in this range , it is conceivable that the 6.5-kpc wide annular bins centered on points in this part of the gcs are simply combining two distinct samples of clusters , rotating about essentially orthogonal axes , whose sinusoidal @xmath243 dependences interfere destructively and average out to a lower amplitude of apparent rotation .    using the spectroscopic metallicities of cohen , blakeslee , & ryzhov ( 1998 ) ,",
    "kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) attempted to distinguish between metal - poor and metal - rich clusters in their study of the rotation properties of the m87 gcs .",
    "they concluded that the blue clusters showed essentially _ no _ rotation , @xmath266 , for small radii @xmath267 kpc .",
    "however , they fixed @xmath80 at about 30@xmath42 e of n in their analysis , and solved only for the amplitude when fitting sines to their @xmath243 data .",
    "the difference between their result and ours for the blue - gcs rotation amplitude stems from the fact that we have found @xmath80 at small @xmath53 to be far away ( i.e. , approaching 90@xmath42 ) from the position angle adopted by kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) .",
    "the acquisition of still more radial velocities for m87 gcs will be important in confirming our findings and in clarifying and quantifying any dichotomies that might exist in the blue vs.  red kinematics .",
    "meanwhile , the surprisingly complicated rotation field that we have uncovered demands the development of sophisticated dynamical models of the gcs . in particular ,",
    "although we proceed in the next section with a standard , one - dimensional jeans - equation analysis of velocity moments in the m87 gcs , we recognize that we can not hope thereby to account rigorously for the dynamical effects of rotation .",
    "in fact , in this analysis we shall neglect rotation altogether , treating it as a perturbation to be addressed in future studies .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] roughly quantifies the effect this choice may have on our results by comparing the rotation amplitude of the m87 gcs to its line - of - sight velocity dispersion , both about the sample mean ( filled circles ) and about the best - fit sine ( open circles ) , at every projected radius .",
    "the ratio of the two is essentially constant with projected radius , holding at a level of about 0.45 for the gcs as a whole and for the metal - poor and metal - rich subsamples individually .",
    "thus , rotation enters as a correction at the @xmath268 level in the jeans - equation analysis that we shall pursue below and , thus , at this exploratory stage , is a relatively small source of uncertainty .",
    "in the absence of rotation and the approximation of spherical symmetry , the fundamental equation of our dynamical analysis is the spherical jeans equation ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the volume density profile of the gcs , @xmath271 is its velocity dispersion in the radial direction , and @xmath272 is a measure of its velocity anisotropy .",
    "the tendency in previous studies along these lines has been to use the projected velocity dispersions of the gcs to infer the intrinsic @xmath271 and thus to constrain the total , `` background '' gravitating mass profile @xmath273 .",
    "to do so , however , requires some _ a priori _ assumptions on the anisotropy profile , @xmath274 , and typically this has meant adopting the simplest case of isotropic orbits with @xmath275 ( see , e.g. , cohen & ryzhov 1997 ) . by contrast ,",
    "romanowsky & kochanek ( 2000 ) apply a technique in which an _ ad hoc _ functional form of @xmath273 is assumed _ a priori _ , and the observed @xmath276 is used in conjunction with sophisticated orbit modelling to constrain both the normalization of the m87/virgo mass profile and the behavior of @xmath274 in the gcs .",
    "this latter procedure is closer in spirit to ours here , in which we specify both @xmath270 and @xmath273 _ in full _ , and then use the observed @xmath276 profiles of  3 to infer something about the anisotropy of the gc orbits in m87 , both globally  for our entire sample  and separately  for the metal - poor and metal - rich populations .",
    "one way to do this is as an inverse problem ( e.g. merritt & oh 1997 ) . in this approach , the observed function @xmath276",
    "is approximated in some model - independent way ( e.g. , via splines ) .",
    "for an assumed @xmath273 , the two unknown functions @xmath271 and @xmath277 then follow uniquely from the jeans equation and the deprojection integral . but given the limited number of velocities in our sample  to say nothing of our neglect of rotation and our assumption of spherical symmetry ",
    "we opt instead to construct a suite of model @xmath276 profiles by specifying @xmath274 _ a priori _ , and then comparing these models with the data to gain a broad , qualitative view of the orbital properties of the m87 gcs .",

    "we have now also used our new ct@xmath20 photometry to measure the surface density profiles , not only for the complete gc sample , but also for the metal - poor and metal - rich samples separately . to do so , our initial catalog of point sources was first trimmed to exclude all objects having t@xmath20 @xmath36 21 , c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath36 0.8 , and c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath299 2.35 , leaving us with a sample of 2130 candidate gcs .",

    "was then subtracted to give the surface density profile for the entire cluster population .",
    "this background level was chosen based on a comparison of our surface density profile with the calibrated surface density profile of mclaughlin ( 1999b ) , and agrees to @xmath12 5% with that predicted by the galactic star count model of bahcall & soneira ( 1981 ) .",
    "the final , blue - plus - red profile is shown as the open circles in figure  [ fig12 ] , where it has been scaled vertically to match the counts from mclaughlin ( 1999b ) and shows good agreement with that independent measurement of @xmath301 .",
    "= 4.0truein    = 4.0truein    = 4.0truein    for the separate metal - rich and metal - poor samples , we have taken the background surface densities to be exactly half that of the total background in our ct@xmath20 sample .",
    "though somewhat arbitrary , these choices of backgrounds are consistent with the color distribution of foreground stars predicted by ratnatunga & bahcall ( 1985 ) for three galactic gcs having galactic latitudes and longitudes similar to m87 .",
    "this approach is obviously inferior to measuring surface densities directly from background fields , but the precise choice of backgrounds has relatively little effect on the final surface density profiles , except in the outermost bins .",
    "the resulting distributions for the metal - rich and metal - poor cluster populations are indicated by the open squares and circled points in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "this shows quite clearly that the metal - poor clusters in m87 follow a much more shallow radial profile than their metal - rich counterparts , consistent with earlier findings based on _ hst _ imaging in the central regions of the galaxy ( e.g. , neilsen , tsvetanov & ford 1999 ) .",
    "there is no reasonable choice of background that can alter this basic conclusion . even if we were to make the highly implausible assumption that the background consists _",
    "entirely _ of sources having colors of c@xmath22t@xmath20 @xmath36 1.42 , this qualitative contrast between the blue and red gcss would remain .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the spatial distribution of the m87 gcs will be presented in geisler , lee & kim ( 2001 ) ; our purposes only require estimations of the overall shapes of @xmath302 and @xmath303 . to obtain these , we project models similar in form to that in equation ( [ eq12 ] ) and fit to the blue- and red - gcs data points in figure  [ fig12 ] .",

    "thus in hand , we solve equations ( [ eq8])([eq10 ] ) for five different _ spatially constant _ values of the gcs orbital anisotropy @xmath309 @xmath310 figures  [ fig13][fig15 ] show the results of this exercise applied to our three gcs samples . in each figure , the top panel shows the observed @xmath276 profile computed by smoothing the data with a radial kernel of fixed width @xmath311 kpc ( rather than the @xmath312 used for figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "also shown are the 90% confidence bands , obtained by bootstrapping as described in  3 .",

    "overlaid on the data in every case are the model curves predicted by substituting equations ( [ eq11])([eq15 ] ) in equations ( [ eq8])([eq10 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that these theoretical velocity dispersion profiles have not been fit to the data : with @xmath273 , @xmath270 , and @xmath309 all specified _ a priori _ , there are no additional parameters to be adjusted .",
    "note that the rising velocity dispersion profile seen in figure  [ fig6 ] is once again evident here  not only in the _ measured _ @xmath276 and @xmath313 profiles , but also in the _ models_. this predicted rise in @xmath276 and @xmath313 comes about because the background mass density profile given by equation  [ eq11 ] , and shown in figure  [ fig10 ] , is shallower at these radii than that of an isothermal sphere .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig13 ] that the m87 gcs _ as a whole _ has an almost perfectly isotropic velocity ellipsoid .",
    "models with even modest amounts of anisotropy , @xmath314 , produce noticeably inferior matches to observed velocity dispersions , while strongly tangentially biased orbits ( @xmath315 ) can be ruled out with @xmath316 confidence and very radial orbits ( @xmath317 ) are altogether out of the question .",
    "however , if the cluster sample is divided on the basis of metallicity , some interesting differences emerge .",
    "figure  [ fig14 ] suggests a modest tangential bias in the metal - poor clusters , with @xmath318 at small radii ( corresponding to @xmath319 ) , perhaps tending towards isotropy at larger radii @xmath2842030 kpc .",
    "the opposite result is seen for the metal - rich gcs , which have a slight _ radial _ bias of roughly the same magnitude : figure  [ fig15 ] suggests @xmath320 , and thus @xmath321 .",
    "this is just what is needed , of course , to balance the anisotropy in the blue gcs and produce the isotropy indicated for the combined sample in figure  [ fig13 ] . qualitatively speaking , these contrasting anisotropies are also what might have been expected _ a priori _ ,",
    "given the fact that the blue gcs has a much shallower density profile than the red subsystem , even though the two populations are embedded in the same gravitational potential and show no significant differences in their projected kinematics ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "romanowsky & kochanek ( 2000 ) have derived a @xmath274 profile for the _ total _ gcs  i.e. , they did not separate their velocity sample on the basis of metallicity . at small radii ,",
    "the implied @xmath309 is markedly negative , thereby implying a substantial tangential bias for the gcs .",
    "however , this claim ultimately rests on their assumption that the background potential of m87/virgo is distributed as a singular isothermal sphere , @xmath322 , whereas the true @xmath273 in the core of virgo is well constrained ( principally by x - ray data ; see nulsen & bhringer 1995 and mclaughlin 1999a ; see also figure  [ fig10 ] ) to grow substantially more rapidly than this with increasing radius . said another way , the density distribution of the gravitating mass in the core of virgo is significantly shallower than the @xmath323 distribution of an isothermal sphere , and therefore the density distribution of the central gcs does not require so large a tangential bias as romanowsky & kochanek ( 2000 ) found necessary to satisfy the jeans equation .",
    "= 4.25truein    = 4.0truein    finally , we consider the effect on our results if our adopted extrapolation of the gcs density profiles in figure  [ fig12 ] and equations ( [ eq12])([eq14 ] ) is somehow in error .",
    "it seems unlikely that the gc distribution could become shallower than the hot intracluster gas ( and the dark matter ) in virgo , and thus figures  [ fig16 ] and [ fig17 ] explore the implications of an @xmath270 that drops off very steeply towards large radii . rather than requiring @xmath324 at the unobserved @xmath294 kpc , then , we take at face value simple fits to our ct@xmath20 density profiles for @xmath325 kpc and assume @xmath326 and @xmath327 the bold , broken lines in figure  [ fig16 ] compares the projection of these functions to the same data considered in figure  [ fig12 ] . the thin , solid line , which shows the sum of the red and blue projected densities , is again in good agreement with the independently observed density distribution of the full gcs .",
    "we use these new density profiles with the same @xmath273 from equation ( [ eq11 ] ) and the same five constant @xmath309 values from equation ( [ eq15 ] ) to compute new models for the @xmath276 and @xmath328 of the metal - poor and the metal - rich components of the gcs .",
    "figure  [ fig17 ] compares these to the data , which again have been smoothed with a @xmath329-wide sliding radial bin and are shown with bootstrap estimates of their 90% confidence bands . because the large-@xmath48 density gradient of both cluster subsystems has been made steeper by hypothesis without changing any other aspect of the dynamical models",
    ", the data would appear now to suggest a move towards substantial radial bias in orbits of both blue and red clusters at the largest radii covered here .",
    "we stress , however , that we regard this particular scenario as a very extreme possibility , as the gcs density profiles postulated earlier are certainly closer to the truth . for instance , if @xmath270 indeed behaves as in figure  [ fig16 ] rather than as in figure  [ fig12 ] , then we must conclude that the gc - to - baryon mass ratio of 0.0026 is only _ coincidentally _ realized , and then over a limited range of radius , in m87  even though this ",

    "before turning our attention to the various models which have been proposed for the formation of gcss and their host galaxies , we pause first to compare our findings for the gcs of m87 with those of other elliptical galaxies . perhaps the most natural comparison is that of m49 , the most luminous member of the virgo cluster , whose gcs has been studied recently by sharples et  al .",

    "thus , at this early stage , no obvious pattern in the dynamical properties of the gcss of elliptical galaxies has yet emerged .",
    "radial velocity surveys of pne represent an alternative , and complementary , method of studying the halo dynamics of giant elliptical galaxies . while there have been no dynamical studies of the pne population of m87 itself , some comparisons are possible for the three luminous early - type galaxies having large numbers of measured pne radial velocities : ngc 5128 ( hui et al .  1995 ) , ngc 4406 ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1996 ) and ngc 1316 ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "the pne in all three galaxies show evidence for significant rotation , @xmath335 - 1 , in their outer regions . in this respect , these galaxies resemble m87 which has @xmath336 from its gcs , with some evidence for slightly lower values in the inner regions of the galaxy and an outward increase in @xmath337 .",
    "moreover , integrated - light spectroscopy in the inner regions of these galaxies reveals little or no rotation in each case , similar to the situation for luminous elliptical galaxies , and for m87 in particular ( e.g. , @xmath338 according to davies & birkinshaw 1988 ) . on the other hand",
    ", none of these galaxies has the generally round and smooth photometric appearance of m87 : ngc 5128 and ngc 1316 are clear examples of recent gas - rich mergers or accretions ( e.g. , schweizer 1980 ) , and ngc 4406 is probably best classified as an s0 galaxy ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1996 ) . while firm conclusions must await the measurement of radial velocities for pne in the vicinity of m87 , our results for the m87 gcs appear consistent with the claim of arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that giant elliptical galaxies , by virtue of their relatively rapid rotation at large radii , may contain roughly as much angular momentum per unit mass as do spiral galaxies _ assuming that the gc and pne kinematics are representative of the kinematics of the underlying galaxy mass . _",
    "it has been known for some time that the surface density profile of the gcs surrounding m87 exhibits a  core \" of radius @xmath339 4 - 5 kpc ( lauer & kormendy 1985 ; mclaughlin 1995 ) .",
    "the possibility that this core developed as a result of gc destruction through tidal shocks from a central bulge or black - hole , or from an underlying triaxial potential , has been explored by many investigators ( e.g. , ostriker , binney & saha 1989 ; pesce , capuzzo - dolcetta & vietri 1992 ) .",
    "these authors also noted that such processes are expected to lead to a preponderance of tube orbits among the surviving gcs relative to the initial sample .",
    "moreover , in the specific case of the galactic gcs , murali & weinberg ( 1997 ) have shown that gcs on eccentric orbits will undergo the most rapid relaxation and evaporation due to enhanced tidal heating ; the preferential destruction of such clusters will therefore lead to an orbital distribution which becomes more tangentially biased with time .",
    "thus , depending of course on the _ initial _ shape of the gcs velocity ellipsoid , the tangential bias which we find for the gcs at small galactocentric radii  especially within an effective radius ( see figures  [ fig13][fig15 ] )  may provide evidence that these dynamical processes have played a role in shaping the presently observed gcs .",
    "fabian , nulsen & canizares ( 1984 ) were the first to propose that the populous gcss associated with some cd galaxies might be the signature of gc formation through cooling flows from their x - ray halos .",
    "a number of difficulties with this scenario have been raised over the years : e.g. , most  high - s@xmath340 \" and/or cooling - flow galaxies show no evidence for young clusters , the gcs are generally more metal - deficient than the intracluster gas , and it is unclear how the cooling gas might condense into clumps of mass @xmath341 . for m87 , which is both an incipient cd galaxy and the prototypical  high  s@xmath340 \" system",
    ", we may now add another difficulty to this list : as described in  4 , the orbits of the surrounding gcs are closely isotropic , _ not the radial orbits expected if the gcs have condensed out of the infalling gas .",
    "_ as figures  [ fig13][fig15 ] demonstrate , purely radial orbits are ruled out at very high significance by our observations .",
    "thus , it appears highly unlikely that a large fraction of m87 s gcs could have formed by mass drop - out from a cooling flow .",
    "can the relatively rapid rotation of the m87 gcs be accommodated within the context of formation models which argue for the monolithic collapse of a single protogalactic gas cloud ?",
    "like those of most other giant elliptical galaxies , the m87 gcs is disjoint in terms of its chemical properties ( i.e. , the gc metallicity distribution function is decidedly bimodal ; whitmore et  al .",
    "1995 ; geisler et  al .",
    "2001 ; see also figure  [ fig1 ] ) , and this observation alone provides a compelling argument against the monolithic collapse picture .",
    "figures  [ fig7][fig9 ] may provide additional evidence against this model : both the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subsamples exhibit significant rotation , with @xmath342 km s@xmath3 and @xmath343 = 0.45 . in monolithic collapse scenarios ,",
    "the angular momentum of galaxies can only arise from tidal torques from companions ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "a common measure of a galaxy s angular momentum content is the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath344 , where @xmath345 , @xmath346 and @xmath347 are the angular momentum , binding energy and mass of the collapsed galaxy .",
    "fall ( 1979 ) showed that , for an elliptical galaxy in gravitational equilibrium , @xmath348 .",
    "thus , the inferred spin parameter of the m87 gcs is @xmath349  lower than , but still consistent with , the value of @xmath350 found by kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) from a smaller sample of gcs .",
    "this spin parameter is roughly twice that expected from analytical and numerical simulations of the collapse of a single , isolated protogalactic cloud ( peebles 1969 ; efstathiou & jones 1979 ) .",
    "it is , however , worth bearing in mind that m87 is by no means an isolated system .",
    "perhaps a more severe obstacle for such models is the abrupt shift in the orientation of the rotation axis for the metal - poor gc subsample at @xmath351 16 - 18 kpc . if real , this feature would be difficult to explain in models where m87 and its gcs formed via the collapse and spin - up of a single protogalactic cloud .",
    "two variations on the general theme of mergers and accretions have been proposed for the formation of globular cluster systems : ( 1 ) _ major mergers _ involving a pair of gas - rich disk galaxies ( each containing only metal - poor gcs ) which results in the formation of new , metal - rich gcs ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) ; and ( 2 ) _ hierarchical growth _ of a pre - existing  seed \" galaxy ( containing its own metal - rich gcs ) through the accretion of numerous smaller galaxies or protogalactic fragments which harbor predominantly metal - poor gcs ( ct , marzke & west 1998 ) .",
    "we discuss the viability of these two models in light of the dynamical evidence presented above .",
    "we begin by reiterating the well established result that mergers of _ purely stellar disks _ are a highly unlikely mechanism for the production of giant elliptical galaxies . both n - body simulations",
    "( @xmath352 , barnes 1992 ; hernquist 1992 ) and simple arguments regarding central phase - space densities ( carlberg 1986 ) have demonstrated that the end - products of such mergers have cores which are far more diffuse than the centers of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "in addition , luminous elliptical galaxies typically have hubble types of e2 ( franx , illingworth & de zeeuw 1991 ) , whereas the end - products of pairs of stellar disks are frequently more elongated , with hubble types of e3-e7 ( hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "finally , the merger end - products often show large misalignments between their rotation and minor axes ( barnes 1992 ; weil & hernquist 1994 ; heyl , hernquist & spergel 1996 ; weil & hernquist 1996 ) . from an observational perspective ,",
    "such large misalignments are rare : franx , illingworth & de zeeuw ( 1991 ) find much smaller misalignments for the majority of giant elliptical galaxies based on long - slit spectroscopy of their integrated light .",
    "there are various ways to surmount some or all of these difficulties within the context of the merger hypothesis : ( 1 ) the stellar disks may initially harbor compact bulges with high phase - space densities ( hernquist 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) the disks may contain significant amounts of gas ( barnes & hernquist 1996 ) ; or ( 3 ) ellipticals may be the result of multiple , dissipationless mergers ( weil & hernquist 1994 ; 1996 ) . from a purely philosophical perspective , the first option is obviously unsatisfactory given that the initial conditions for spiral - spiral mergers require a significant fraction of the initial mass to reside in compact , dynamically hot components . in the words of hernquist ( 1993 ) ,  it seems likely that even the most strident critics of the merger hypothesis would admit the possibility that mergers of small ellipticals will yield big ellipticals . \"",
    "the second alternative  that giant ellipticals form during dissipative mergers of pairs of stellar disks , each of which contain significant gas components  is closely related to the ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) model for the formation of gcss in giant elliptical galaxies . in the specific case of m87 ,",
    "the most compelling piece of evidence for a past major merger is the possible flip in the position angle of the rotation axis for the metal - poor gcs ; we caution , however , that this interpretation of the observed discontinuity is not unique ( see  5.7 ) . as a further complication ,",
    "the uncertainties involved in correctly modeling the effects of gas cooling , feedback and star formation in dissipational spiral - spiral simulations are formidable . to date",
    ", the most detailed study of merging galaxies to include gas - dynamical effects is that of barnes & hernquist ( 1996 ) , who approximated the interstellar medium as an incompressible fluid .",
    "they found that the inclusion of a gaseous component has a dramatic effect on the properties of the merger end - products , and may alleviate some of the problems described above for the case of purely stellar mergers : i.e. , including gas leads to merger remnants which have somewhat higher central densities , and may also produce closer alignments between the angular momenta and minor axes .",
    "these conclusions , however , are highly dependent on how the gas is assumed to cool ( see , e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1994 , and especially  4.3 of barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .    simulations of merging stellar disks have shown that the angular momentum axes of the merger remnants often show large misalignments with the minor axes . at large radii , metal - poor and metal - rich gcss in m87",
    "both rotate around axes which are closely aligned with the minor axis .",
    "if the gcs are accurately tracing the kinematics of the underlying galaxy mass , this alignment may constitute a difficulty for the major merger model ; that is to say , such a small misalignment in the merger remnant is by no means implausible in the major merger model , but neither is it predicted . in their simulations of gas - free mergers of equal - mass disks ,",
    "heyl , hernquist & spergel ( 1996 ) find the distribution of misalignment angles to be nearly flat , with occasional misalignments of 75@xmath353 or 80@xmath353 although , as mentioned above , gas may play a role in ameliorating these large misalignments .",
    "it is clear that additional research into the influence of gas on the non - axisymmetry of merger remnants is needed urgently .",
    "moreover , it is important to quantify the expected angular momentum content and rotational properties of any stars or gcs which might form during dissipational mergers . in the case of m87 ,",
    "both the metal - poor and metal - rich samples show significant rotation , with @xmath354 0.45 .",
    "this value is intermediate to the disparate values of @xmath354 1 ( ct 1999 ) and @xmath355 0.1 ( zepf et  al . 2000 ) observed for the metal - rich gcs belonging to the milky way and ngc 4472 , respectively . yet",
    "the metal - rich gcs in both of these galaxies have been identified as the end - products of gas - rich mergers ( i.e. , ashman & zepf 1992 and zepf & ashman 1993 for the milky way ; and zepf et  al . 2000 for ngc 4472 ) .    in the dissipationless hierarchical growth scenario ,",
    "the simulations of weil & hernquist ( 1994 ; 1996 ) indicate that the rotation axis of the merger remnant is expected to be more closely aligned with the photometric minor axis . strictly speaking , these simulations",
    " which do not include gas  apply to merger remnants of small virialized groups of galaxies , although the generic kinematic properties of the end - products are similar to those found in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation through the hierarchical agglomeration of smaller galaxies and protogalactic fragments ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; frenk et al .",

    "there is also some evidence that the inferred rotation of the m87 gcs ( particularly that of the metal - poor component ) may include a contribution from large - scale streaming motions along the virgo principal axis ( see below ) . and while the simulations of weil & hernquist ( 1996 ) produce end - products with low triaxialities and roughly oblate shapes ( consistent with the results of dynamical modeling of the line - of - sight velocity profile in the inner regions of m87",

    "( 1998 ) who , from keck spectroscopy of the brightest clusters in m87 , found the metal - rich and metal - poor gc populations to be both old and coeval ( i.e. , @xmath358 gyr ) .",
    "the principal obstacle to understanding the merger / accretion history of m87 remains the uncertain role played by gas . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "improved numerical simulations that include gas - dynamical effects and star formation are needed urgently . on the observational front , it is important to measure the star formation history of the gcs _ directly _ , through improved age estimates for the chemically distinct gc populations ( e.g. , jordan et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "3.5truein    = 6.0truein      it has long been known that the brightest of virgo s giant elliptical galaxies define a remarkably linear pattern on the plane of the sky ( arp 1968 ) .",
    "it was recently shown that this extended arrangement , which passes through the cluster core at a position angle of 110 - 125@xmath353 and is roughly centered on m87 , is the projection of a highly collinear , three - dimensional filament  the so - called `` principal axis '' of the virgo cluster ( west & blakeslee 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the rotation axis of the m87 globular cluster system not only coincides with the galaxy s minor axis at large galactocentric radii , but is also roughly aligned with the minor axis of the surrounding cluster .",

    "1998 , 2000 )  that formed normal complements of ( generally metal - poor ) globular clusters , but were then destroyed before much further star formation occurred , perhaps as a result of galactic winds driven at least in part by the gc formation itself ( harris et al . 1998",
    "; mclaughlin 2000 ) . whether or not the numbers of any such clouds were enhanced in virgo through cold - dark - matter biasing of either the gcs ( west 1993 ) or their host protogalactic fragments ( see ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , the plausible result could have been an addition to the intracluster medium of _ globular clusters and hot gas _ that eventually settled naturally to the bottom of the cluster s potential well , i.e. , directly around m87 .",
    "the evidence in support of such a connection between the m87 gcs and the virgo cluster can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , like all cd galaxies , m87 possesses an extended , low - surface - brightness envelope , and much evidence exists that such envelopes are entities quite _ distinct _ from cd galaxy cores . for instance , these galaxies obey the @xmath359-@xmath360 relation defined by normal ellipticals only after the luminosity excess above an @xmath361-law fit to the surface brightness profile of the interior is excluded ( tonry 1987 ) ; the total luminosity of cd envelopes correlates with several cluster properties including cluster richness and x - ray luminosity ; the surface brightness profiles of the envelopes obey density profiles that roughly match that of the galaxies in their parent clusters ( schombert 1988 ) ; and the ellipticity and position angle of the galaxy isophotes often show dramatic discontinuities at the radius where the envelope begins to dominate the surface brightness profile .",
    "this latter issue is particularly germane in the case of m87 .",
    "mclaughlin , harris & hanes ( 1993 , 1994 ) showed that the gcs _ itself _ exhibits a sharp jump in surface density which coincides with the onset of the stellar cd envelope , and that the ellipticity and orientation of the gcs roughly matches that of the underlying envelope .",
    "moreover , as was described in  4 , the so - called `` excess '' of globular clusters at large radii in m87 is now recognized to be _ not _ a genuine surfeit , but a consequence of the fact that the gcs - to - baryon mass ratio there has the same value , @xmath362 = 0.0026 $ ] , that is exhibited by nearly one hundred other galaxies ( mclaughlin 1999b ) . since the stellar component of m87 dies out relatively rapidly beyond @xmath363 kpc ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) , the natural interpretation is that the distant gcs are associated with the x - ray gas around m87  and that gas is itself at the virial temperature of the virgo _ cluster _",
    "dark matter halo ( see , e.g. , mclaughlin 1999a ) .",
    "the dynamical analysis presented in this paper adds to this line of argument .",
    "in particular , it is noteworthy that the position angle of the rotation axis of the metal - poor gcs shows an apparent discontinuity close to the onset of the cd envelope . to aid in the visualization of this discontinuity , figure",
    "[ fig18 ] shows the orientation of the angular momenta axes of metal - poor and metal - rich gcs surrounding m87 overlaid on an image from the palomar digital sky survey .",
    "the blue and red arrows refer to the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs , respectively .",
    "the length of each arrow is proportional to the amplitude @xmath364 of the best - fit sine curve in radial bins of fixed width @xmath365 6.5 kpc ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the dotted yellow curves show the best - fit ellipses to the surface brightness profile of the galaxy , taken from carter and dixon ( 1978 ) .",
    "the ellipse nearest the onset of the cd envelope is shown by the bold , dashed curve .",
    "recall from  4 that in the limit of @xmath366 , @xmath367 .",
    "thus , the metal - poor component dominates the gcs at these radii , although _ both _ components ( i.e. , the metal - rich _ and _ the metal - poor cluster systems ) appear to rotate around an axis which is roughly aligned with the minor axis of the large - scale structure in virgo . at the largest observed radii ,",
    "the rotation curve of the gcs approaches the circular velocity of virgo itself ( although the uncertainties in the fitted values of @xmath368 are large at these distances ) .    to examine the apparent rotation of the m87 gcs in more detail , and to explore the possible connections with bulk motions in the virgo cluster , we have generated two - dimensional maps of the gc velocity fields using the non - parametric techniques described in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and merritt , meylan & mayor ( 1997 ) . in this approach , the cluster - by - cluster velocity residuals about a mean",
    ", line - of - sight velocity are smoothed with a  thin - plate smoothing spline \" which is chosen on the basis of a generalized cross validation technique ( wahba 1990 ) .",
    "the results of this exercise are presented in figure  [ fig19 ] .",
    "panels ( a - c ) in this figure show smoothed velocity fields for the full sample of gcs , the metal - rich subsample and the metal - poor subsample , respectively .",
    "a striking feature of this figure ( panel b ) is the form of the rotational field for the metal - rich gcs : i.e. , it appears non - cylindrical in nature , consistent with the discussion around equations ( [ eq3])-([eq5 ] ) in  3 .",
    "rather , the rotation field shows a  double - lobed \" pattern with maxima at @xmath4 3.5 - 4@xmath5 ( 25 - 30 kpc ) along the approximate photometric major axis of the galaxy , although additional radial velocities may be needed to fully characterize the true two - dimensional rotation field .",
    "panel ( c ) suggests that the rotation field of the metal - poor gcs may more closely resemble that of a solid body ; or , alternatively , it may show evidence for a `` shear '' in the line - of - sight velocity . the magnitude and orientation of this putative shear is apparent in panel ( d ) of this figure , which shows the plane of best - fit to the velocity residuals for the metal - poor gcs .",
    "interestingly , the sharp flip in the rotation axis of the metal - poor clusters seen in the previous figure is not obvious in this ( smoothed ) representation of the two - dimensional velocity field , although there does appear to be a local minimum in the rotation velocity due south of the galaxy s center at a distance of @xmath369 ( 7 kpc ) .",
    "based on the kinematics of dwarf galaxies and x - ray imaging , binggeli ( 1999 ) has argued that the virgo cluster , and particularly its dwarf galaxies , are not yet in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "rather , material appears to be infalling onto m87 along the principal axis of the virgo cluster .",
    "it is notable that this axis passes though both m87 and m86  each of these supergiant elliptical galaxies is embedded in a swarm of dwarf elliptical galaxies and thereby defines a major virgo subcluster .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if the kinematics of the gcs surrounding m87 is related to that of the more distant virgo _",
    "galaxies_. such a comparison is especially relevant to the notion that some fraction of the m87 gcs might be composed of the accreted and/or infalling remains of `` failed dwarfs '' .",
    "= 4.0truein    in order to compare the large - scale kinematics of virgo directly to that of the m87 gcs , we have carried out the same smoothing procedure described above for the virgo cluster galaxies . using the nasa extragalactic database",
    ", we identified a sample of 117 galaxies which are located within 2@xmath353 ( 525 kpc ) of m87 and have measured radial velocities in the range @xmath370 km s@xmath3 . the two - dimensional rotation field for this sample is shown in panel ( e ) of figure  [ fig19 ] ; the corresponding plane of best - fit to the observed velocity residuals is shown in panel ( f ) .",
    "although the limited sample size makes firm conclusions impossible , it does appear that the virgo galaxies show evidence for a gradient in their line - of - sight velocity which is roughly in the same direction as that observed for the distant metal - poor gcs surrounding m87  broadly consistent with the infall picture .",
    "finally , we consider the _ one - dimensional _ velocity dispersion profile of the m87 gcs in the larger context of the surrounding virgo cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig20 ] shows the measured and predicted gc aperture dispersion profiles from figures  [ fig13]-[fig15 ] , placed now on an expanded radial scale that also includes data for 246 early - type ( mostly de ) virgo _ galaxies _ from girardi et  al .",
    "error bars on the latter measurements refer to 95% confidence limits .",
    "the three curves show the predicted @xmath371 profiles corresponding to the gc subsystems and orbital anisotropies indicated in the lower right corner of the figure .",
    "cases of purely radial orbits , @xmath372 = 1 , are not shown since all such models are ruled out at high confidence ( see figures  [ fig13][fig15 ] ) .",
    "given that the early - type galaxies in virgo trace the cluster s dark - matter density profile ( mclaughlin 1999a ) , the striking match seen here between the kinematics of the gcs and the galaxies lends support to our earlier assertion ( recall eqs .",
    "[ [ eq12]][[eq14 ] ] and fig .  [ fig12 ] )",
    "that , in the limit of large galactocentric radius , the m87 gcs also traces the virgo dark matter .",
    "thus , the properties of the globular clusters surrounding m87 are consistent with their being an ensemble of test particles  identical in this regard to the virgo _ galaxies _  which happen to be orbiting in the potential well defined by _ both _ the galaxy _ and _ its parent cluster .",
    "we have presented a dynamical analysis of the gc system surrounding m87 , the cd galaxy at the dynamical center of the virgo cluster .",
    "our database consists of new wide - field imaging in the washington c and t@xmath20 filters , and radial velocities for 278 gcs taken from the literature or obtained during a dedicated spectroscopic survey conducted with the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "this constitutes the largest sample of radial velocities for pure population ii tracers yet assembled for any galaxy . a complete description of the database is presented in a companion paper ( hanes et al . 2001 ) .",
    "surface density profiles measured from our ct@xmath20 images reveals the metal - poor gcs to be more spatially extended than the metal - rich population , consistent with earlier findings based on _ hst _ imaging in the central regions of the galaxy . beyond a radius of @xmath0 ( 10 kpc ) ,",
    "the metal - poor clusters dominate the total gcs .",
    "the combined , metal - poor and metal - rich samples all show significant rotation of mean amplitude @xmath342 km s@xmath3 about axes whose position angles are indistinguishable from that of the photometric minor axis , @xmath1 .",
    "the metal - rich gcs shows a roughly flat rotation curve of mean amplitude @xmath373 km s@xmath3 .",
    "apart from a possible drift in position angle of the rotation axis at @xmath4 2@xmath5 , the metal - rich clusters appear to be rotating everywhere about the photometric minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the rotation field , however , appears non - cylindrical  a two - dimensional map of the rotation field for the metal - rich gcs shows a  double - lobed \" pattern , with maxima at @xmath4 3.5 - 4@xmath5 ( 25 - 30 kpc ) along the approximate photometric major axis of the galaxy .",
    "while the mean rotation velocity of the metal - poor gcs , @xmath374 km s@xmath3 , is indistinguishable from that of its metal - rich counterpart , a two - dimensional map of the rotation field suggests that this system may rotate as a solid - body or , alternatively , it may exhibit a  shear \" in the line - of - sight velocity .",
    "this putative shear is similar to that observed for virgo _ galaxies _ within two degrees of m87  broadly consistent with a scenario in which some , or all , of the distant , metal - poor gcs are gradually infalling onto m87 along virgo s principal axis . inside @xmath375",
    "( 18 kpc ) , the approximate onset of the galaxy s cd envelope , the metal - poor gcs appears to rotate around the photometric _ major _ axis .",
    "the surface brightness profile of m87 has been combined with rosat observations of the surrounding x - ray gas to construct a mass model for the virgo cluster .",
    "a comparison of the observed and predicted gc velocity dispersion profiles based on this model , and on the measured gc density profiles , suggests that the velocity ellipsoid of the composite gcs is almost perfectly isotropic . dividing",
    "the sample on the basis of metallicity reveals the metal - poor clusters to be slightly biased to tangential orbits , with @xmath376 , while the metal - rich cluster system shows a radial bias of the roughly the same magnitude : @xmath377 .",
    "we note that a simple mass model for m87 and virgo provides a remarkably accurate match to the observed gc kinematics , suggesting that the gcs , as a whole , belong to both m87 and the surrounding virgo cluster .",
    "more detailed conclusions concerning the formation of m87 and its gcs must await the measurement of precise _ ages _ for the metal - poor and metal - rich gc systems  the most outstanding observational constraints bearing on this issue .",

    "<S> * when considered in their entirety , each of the combined , metal - poor and metal - rich globular cluster samples ( 278 , 161 and 117 clusters , respectively ) appear to rotate , with similar rotation amplitudes , about axes whose position angles are indistinguishable from that of the photometric minor axis , @xmath1 . * </S>",
    "<S> the one - dimensional rotation curve ( i.e. , binned in circular annuli ) for the metal - rich cluster system has a roughly constant mean amplitude of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the metal - rich clusters appear to be rotating , at all radii , about the photometric minor axis of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> however , a smoothed , two - dimensional map of the line - of - sight velocity residuals suggests that the rotation field for the metal - rich clusters is non - cylindrical in nature . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it exhibits a  </S>",
    "<S> double - lobed \" pattern , with maxima at @xmath4 3.5 - 4@xmath5 ( 25 - 30 kpc ) along the approximate photometric major axis of the galaxy . * </S>",
    "<S> the one - dimensional rotation curve of the metal - poor cluster system has mean amplitude of @xmath6 km s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional map of the rotation field for the metal - poor clusters shows some evidence for solid - body rotation or , alternatively , for a  shear \" in the line - of - sight velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this shear is similar in size and orientation to that observed for virgo _ galaxies _ within two degrees of m87 , and is consistent with a scenario , previously suggested on the basis of dwarf galaxy kinematics and x - ray imaging , in which material is gradually infalling onto m87 along the so - called  principal axis \" of the virgo cluster . * beyond a radius of @xmath7 ( 15 kpc ) , the approximate onset of the galaxy s cd envelope , the metal - poor globular cluster system rotates about the photometric minor axis  similar to its metal - rich counterpart . inside this radius , however , the metal - poor clusters appear to rotate around the photometric _ major _ axis . * </S>",
    "<S> the complete sample of 278 globular clusters has an almost perfectly isotropic velocity ellipsoid , with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> * when considered separately , the metal - poor cluster system shows a modest but significant _ tangential _ bias of @xmath9 , while the velocity ellipsoid of the metal - rich cluster system is _ radially _ biased , with @xmath10 .    taken together , </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that the dual nature of the m87 globular cluster system  first identified on the basis of its bimodal metallicity distribution  also extends to its dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these findings for the various formation scenarios proposed for giant elliptical galaxies and their globular cluster systems . </S>"
