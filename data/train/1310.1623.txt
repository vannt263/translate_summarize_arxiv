    "mergers of compact binaries such as binary neutron stars  ( ns - nss ) and black hole - neutron star binaries  ( bh - nss ) are the candidates for progenitors of short - hard gamma - ray bursts  ( grbs )  @xcite . as an observable consequence of compact binary mergers , an electromagnetic transient powered by radioactive decay of the heavy elements produced in their ejecta ( so - called kilonova / macronova ) was proposed by @xcite .",
    "recently , a strong evidence of the electromagnetic transient associated with the short grb 130603b was observed by _ hubble space telescope _",
    "the observed near - infrared excess is largely consistent with the radioactively powered emission models of ns - ns merger ejecta  @xcite .",
    "this could be a direct evidence for the compact binary merger scenario of short grbs .",

    "r_-process elements heats the ejecta and gives rise to an electromagnetic transient emission  @xcite .",
    "the _ r_-process elements play also an important role as the dominant opacity source of the ejecta .",
    "the bound - bound transitions of partially ionized _",
    "r_-process elements significantly enhance the opacity of the ejecta in ultraviolet to near - infrared wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "the brightness and time scale of an electromagnetic transient depend also on the global properties of the ejecta such as the mass , expansion velocity , and morphology . using the observed data of the near - infrared excess , @xcite estimated the ejecta mass and expansion velocity under the assumption of spherically expanding ejecta .",
    "these properties of the ejecta depend on the type of the progenitor  ( ns - ns or bh - ns ) , on the parameters of the progenitor models such as mass and spin of the two objects , and on the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - star matter .",
    "recent numerical simulations of compact binary mergers have explored the ejecta properties  . by these numerical studies",
    ", we can estimate the dependences of the ejecta properties on the parameters of the progenitor models and on eoss .",
    "therefore , combining the observed data of the near - infrared excess and the results of numerical simulations , it is possible to constrain the progenitor models of the short grb 130603b .",
    "l l    in this letter , we explore possible progenitor models of the electromagnetic transient associated with the short grb 130603b using our numerical - relativity simulations and radiative transfer simulations of the dynamical ejecta of compact binary mergers .",
    "we focus in particular on its dependence on the eos of neutron - star matter .",
    "the density and velocity structures of the ejecta of compact binary mergers are determined by the numerical - relativity simulation using sacra code  @xcite .",
    "we follow the dynamical ejecta with the numerical - relativity simulation until the head of the ejecta reaches @xmath0  km  ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . after that , the density and velocity structures of the ejecta are modeled assuming homologous expansion  @xcite . for the simulations , we employ a piecewise polytropic eos with which the cold eoss of neutron - star matter are well fitted  @xcite . for systematic studies of the dependence of mass ejection on the cold eoss of neutron - star matter , we consider five cold eoss : apr4  @xcite and sly   as soft eoss , alf2  @xcite as a moderate eos , and h4  @xcite and ms1  @xcite as stiff eoss  km and @xmath1  km , respectively . here",

    "for all the eoss , the maximum masses of spherical neutron stars are larger than @xmath4 . ] .    for ns - ns mergers ,",
    "we choose the total gravitational mass of the binary @xmath5 and the mass ratio with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the component masses of a binary . ]",
    "for bh - ns mergers , the gravitational mass of the neutron star @xmath10 is fixed to be @xmath3 and the mass ratio is chosen to be @xmath11 .",
    "the nondimensional spin parameter of the black hole @xmath12 is chosen as @xmath13 .",
    "we also perform the simulations for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these parameters , ejecta masses @xmath16 , and averaged ejecta velocities @xmath17 of the progenitor models are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the morphologies of the ejecta for ns - ns and bh - ns mergers are compared in fig .",
    "this figure plots the profiles of the density and velocity fields at @xmath18  ms after the onset of the merger .",
    "note that the ejecta velocities are in the small range between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , because those are roughly equal to the escape velocities from the neutron stars , which do not depend sensitively on the progenitor models .",
    "however , the total mass and morphology of the ejecta depend sensitively on the progenitor models . in the following",
    ", we briefly summarize these properties of the ns - ns and bh - ns ejecta .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ ns - ns ejecta . _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the ns - ns ejecta have spheroidal shape rather than a torus or a disk irrespective of @xmath21 and eos as long as a hypermassive neutron star is formed after the merger .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the origin of the ejecta for ns - ns mergers can be divided into two parts : the contact interface of two neutron stars at the collision and the tidal tails formed during an early stage of the merger . at the contact interface",
    ", the kinetic energy of the approaching velocities of the two stars is converted into thermal energy through shock heating .",
    "the heated matter at the contact interface expands into low - density region . as a result",
    ", the shocked matter can escape even toward the rotational axis and the ejecta shape becomes spheroidal .",
    "by contrast , the tidal tail component is asymmetric and the ejecta is distributed near the equatorial plane .",
    "numerical simulations of ns - ns mergers show that the total amount of ejecta is in a range @xmath22@xmath23 depending on @xmath24 , @xmath21 , and eoss  ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the more compact neutron star models with soft eoss produce the larger amounts of ejecta , because the impact velocities and subsequent shock heating effects at merger are larger .",
    "more specifically , the amounts of the ejecta are @xmath25    @xcite also show a similar dependence of the ejecta masses on the eoss and @xmath26 for stiff eos models . according to these results , it is worthy to note that the ejecta masses of the stiff eos models are likely to be at most @xmath27 .",
    "the dependence of the ejecta mass on the total mass of the binary is rather complicated as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "the ejecta mass increases basically with increasing @xmath24 as long as a hypermassive neutron star with lifetime @xmath28  ms is formed after the merger .",
    "more massive ns - ns mergers result in hypermassive neutron stars with lifetime @xmath29  ms or in black holes .",
    "for such a case , the ejecta mass decreases with increasing @xmath24 because of the shorter duration for the mass ejection .",
    "_ bh - ns ejecta .",
    "_ tidal disruption of a neutron star results in the anisotropic mass ejection for a bh - ns merger  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the ejecta concentrate near the binary orbital plane as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and its shape is like a disk or crescent .",
    "the amounts of the ejecta for bh - ns models are smaller for the more compact neutron star models with the fixed values of @xmath12 and @xmath21 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "this is because the tidal disruption occurs in a less significant manner for the more compact neutron star models .",
    "this dependence of the bh - ns ejecta on the compactness of neutron stars is opposite to the ns - ns ejecta .",
    "more specifically , the amounts of the ejecta are @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath15 , the ejecta mass is smaller than that for @xmath31 .",
    "only the stiff eos models can produce large amounts of ejecta more than @xmath27 for @xmath15 and @xmath14 .    both for ns - ns and bh - ns merger models ,",
    "winds driven by neutrino / viscous / nuclear - recombination heating or magnetic field from the central object might provide ejecta in addition to the dynamical ejecta  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not easy to estimate the amount of the wind ejecta , because it depends strongly on the condition of the remnant formed after the merger . in this letter",
    ", we focus only on the dynamical ejecta .",
    "for the ns - ns and bh - ns merger models described in section 2 , we perform radiative transfer simulations to obtain the light curves of the radioactively powered emission from the ejecta using the three - dimensional , time - dependent , multi - frequency monte carlo radiative transfer code  @xcite . for a given density structure of the ejecta and elemental abundances , this code computes the emission in the ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared wavelength ranges by taking into account the detailed opacities of @xmath33-process elements . in this letter",
    ", we include @xmath33-process elements with @xmath34 assuming the solar abundance ratios by  @xcite .",
    "more details of the radiative transfer simulations are described in @xcite .",
    "the heating rate from the radioactive decay of @xmath33-process elements is one of the important ingredients of the radiative transfer simulations . as a fiducial - heating model",
    ", we employ the heating rate computed with the abundance distribution that reproduces the solar @xmath33-process pattern  ( see tanaka et al .",
    "2013 for more detail ) .",
    "heating is due to @xmath35-decays only , which increase the atomic numbers from the neutron - rich region toward the @xmath35-stability line without changing the mass number @xmath36 .",
    "this heating rate is in reasonable agreement with those from previous nucleosynthesis calculations  @xcite except for the first several seconds .",
    "we note that there could exist quantitative uncertainties in the heating rate as well as in the opacities . as an exapmle",
    ", the heating rate would be about a factor 2 higher if the @xmath33-process abundances of @xmath37 ( or those produced with the electron fraction of @xmath38 ) were dominant in the ejecta  @xcite . to take into account such uncertainties",
    ", we also consider the cases in which the light curves of mergers are twice and half as luminous ( high- and low - heating models ; only explicitly shown for the ns - ns models in fig .",
    "3 ) as those computed with the fiducial - heating model .",
    "the computed light curves and observed data in _ r _ and _ h_-band are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the light curves of the ns - ns merger models sly  ( @xmath39 ,  @xmath40 ) and h4  ( @xmath41 ,  @xmath42 ) for reference . here the total mass of the binary is chosen to be @xmath43 .",
    "we plot three light curves derived with the fiducial-  ( the middle curves ) , high-  ( the upper curves ) , and low - heating models  ( the lower curves ) .",
    "we expect that the realistic light curves may lie within the shaded regions . for the ns - ns models ,",
    "the computed _",
    "r_-band light curves are fainter than 30  mag . the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the light curves of the bh - ns merger models , ms1  ( @xmath44 ) , h4  ( @xmath45 ) , and apr4  ( @xmath46 ) with @xmath47 . for these cases",
    ", we employ the fiducial - heating model .",
    "note that the _ r_-band light curves of the bh - ns models reach @xmath48  mag , which implies that the light curves of the bh - ns models are bluer than those of the ns - ns models .",
    "this is because the energy from the radioactive decay is deposited to a small volume for the bh - ns models  ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "l l    we now translate these results into the progenitor models , such as mass ratio , black hole spin , and eos .",
    "_ ns - ns models . _ the ns - ns models for grb 130603b should have ejecta of mass @xmath49 .",
    "this is consistent with that derived by  @xcite .",
    "this value strongly constrains the ns - ns models because the amount of the ejecta is at most @xmath50 for an ns - ns merger within the plausible mass range of the observed ns - ns systems  @xcite .",
    "specifically , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , such a large amount of ejecta can be obtained only for the soft eos models in which a hypermassive neutron star with lifetime @xmath28  ms is formed after the merger . for the stiff eos models ,",
    "the amount of the ejecta is at most @xmath51 .",
    "thus we conclude that the ejecta of the ns - ns models with soft eoss ( @xmath52  km ) are favored as the progenitor of grb 130603b .",

    "[ fig2 ] . for the soft eos models , the total amount of ejecta reaches only @xmath27 as long as @xmath55 , which hardly reproduces the observed near - infrared excess .",
    "thus the models with stiff eoss are favored for the bh - ns merger models as long as with @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the progenitor model of grb 130603b .",
    "it is worthy to note that any bh - ns models with @xmath58 and @xmath59 are unlikely to reproduce the observed near - infrared excess .",

    "r_-process elements , so called kilonova / macronova .",
    "we analyzed the dynamical ejecta of ns - ns and bh - ns mergers for the progenitor models of this event .",
    "for computing the expected light curves , we carried out the radiative transfer simulations using the density and velocity structures obtained from the numerical - relativity simulations with several total masses , mass ratios , and eoss . depending on these quantities , the total amount of ejecta mass varies by orders of magnitude @xmath60 to @xmath23 for the ns - ns models and @xmath61 to @xmath62 for the bh - ns models .",
    "the expected light curves for the bh - ns models are bluer than those for the ns - ns models due to the morphology effects .    for both ns - ns and bh - ns models",
    ", we found that there are progenitor models that can reproduce the observed near - infrared excess within the realistic parameter ranges . specifically , the observed data suggest that the required ejecta mass is at least @xmath50 for ns - ns mergers . for bh - ns mergers ,",
    "the required ejecta mass would be @xmath63@xmath64 taking into account the uncertainty in the heating rate and opacities .",
    "these values are consistent with the results of a spherically expanding ejecta model  @xcite . such a large amount of material is ejected when a hypermassive neutron star with its lifetime @xmath28  ms is formed after the merger for the ns - ns models and when the neutron star is tidally disrupted for the bh - ns models . for these cases , the merger results in a spinning black hole surrounded by a massive torus @xmath65 .",
