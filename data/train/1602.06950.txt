    "x - ray observations have shown that the study of the intracluster medium ( icm ) can be used to test plasma physics under extreme conditions that can not be achieved in terrestrial laboratories , as well as an important cosmological probe .",
    "however , the study of cosmology using clusters of galaxies relies heavily on the understanding of cluster physics . for precision cosmology , systematic uncertainties at even the percent level are quite significant . even though present x - ray measurements of clusters for cosmological studies are limited to the inner regions ( @xmath9 due to sensitivity limits is the radius within which the mean total mass density of the cluster is @xmath10 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "the virial radius @xmath11 is defined as a radius within which the cluster is virialized . for the einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath12 , while for the standard @xmath13cdm universe , @xmath14 . in this paper",
    ", we also call @xmath1 the virial radius since this definition is still widely used in the literature . ] ) , many x - ray observations and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) observations have already extended to larger radii .",
    "thus , a full understanding of the outer parts of clusters is essential .",
    "compared to the central regions , cluster envelopes were thought to be relatively simple because they are less subject to additional physics including cooling , and agn feedback , and that the cluster outer regions might provide better cosmological probes .",
    "this appeared to be supported by earlier observational results with _",
    "rosat _ that the x - ray surface brightness around @xmath1 is generally consistent with numerical simulations .",
    "however , more recent observations , primarily with _ suzaku _ , have shown a number of unexpected results ( see a recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "for example , it has been suggested that the icm near @xmath1 can be rather clumpy , which means the enclosed gas - mass fraction measured with x - ray can be biased high and may exceed the cosmic baryon fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; although @xcite and @xcite pointed out that clumpiness in the simulations by @xcite becomes dominant only beyond @xmath1 .",
    "the entropy near @xmath1 of some massive clusters measured with _",
    "suzaku _ appears to be significantly lower than the predictions from the gravity heating - only models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , although the _ rosat _ results are less significant @xcite . this low entropy may indicate that the collisional equilibrium of electrons and ions has not been achieved in the low density hot gas in cluster outskirts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may introduce biases in cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "pressure support from turbulence / bulk motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or cosmic rays @xcite are also thought to be important around @xmath1 , resulting in the breakdown of the hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) approximation if only the thermal pressure is considered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more than a dozen clusters have been studied with spatially and spectrally resolved gas profiles out to @xmath2@xmath1 to understand these anomalous effects ( see again the review by * ? ? ?",
    "mapping the nearest clusters with mosaic pointings to cover angular scales of order degrees has revealed the complex icm structures in tremendous spatial detail .",
    "a direct comparison to the nearest clusters with different physical properties in our neighborhood is certainly important to understand the cluster outskirts .",
    "for example , the nearby massive cool core cluster , perseus ( distance @xmath15=70mpc , @xmath1=1.8mpc=1.4 : * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shows significant bias in the gas fraction and entropy deficit near @xmath1 , as well as strong azimuthal variations . the massive merging cluster , coma ( @xmath15=100mpc , @xmath1@xmath22mpc=1.2 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shows both a dynamical active environment with a merging group in one direction and a relaxed environment along the other directions .    the nearest cluster ( or group ) , virgo ( @xmath15=16mpc , @xmath1=1mpc=4 ) , which is also a cool core with a lower mass ( @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 ) and temperature ( @xmath19kev ) compared to the massive clusters ( @xmath20 ) mentioned above , has also been mapped out to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "low mass galaxy groups are in fact also very important to cosmological studies . because of their high abundance , they contribute significantly to the sz power spectrum at angular scales of @xmath21 that are sensitive to cosmological parameters @xcite . the previous _ xmm - newton _",
    "result for virgo suggests that its density profile near @xmath1 has a power law ( @xmath22 ) slope of @xmath23 which is significantly flatter than for massive cluster counterparts ( e.g. , @xmath24 for perseus , @xcite ; @xmath25 for a1795 , @xcite ; and @xmath263 for a stacked _ chandra _ sample , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to wonder whether non - cool core groups behave in the same manner or differently , compared with massive clusters or the virgo cool core group ; understanding this will have deep implications for both cluster studies and cosmology .    sitting at a distance of @xmath15=39.8mpc @xcite , the antlia cluster is the nearest non - cool core cluster ( or a group with similar size to the virgo cluster ) and also the third closest galaxy cluster after the fornax cool core cluster ( group ) .",
    "x - ray observations suggest that the antlia core is approximately isothermal ( @xmath27kev ) with no significant excess central brightness @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is centered on the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 3268 and is elongated toward the southwest where there is a subgroup centered on another bright elliptical galaxy ngc 3258 , indicating that the antlia cluster is accreting along this direction ( figure  [ fig : image ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical observations suggest that antlia is dynamically younger than virgo and fornax , and the large - scale filament structure of the galaxies are along the northwest and southeast directions . @xcite .          here , we report the results from mosaic _ suzaku _ observations of antlia to the east direction out to @xmath4 . compared to studying cool core clusters / groups , the non - cool core antlia is less subject to systematic uncertainty due to the telescope scattering of x - ray photons from the bright center to the outer regions , which are of greatest interest here .",
    "the direction was chosen so that it is away from the accreting filament direction where substructures induced by accretion can disturb the global properties significantly .",
    "thus , the eastern direction should be more relaxed compared to the filament directions , as we will also show in section  [ sec : dis1 ] below .",
    "it was also chosen to avoid many of the point sources and the high background seen on the _ rosat _ image .",
    "we made use of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data to minimize the uncertainty due to point sources unresolved by _",
    "suzaku _ @xcite .",
    "we also compared our results with _",
    "rosat _ data to ensure that the soft x - ray emission determined with _",
    "suzaku _ was robust ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    with the growing number of clusters and groups measured out to @xmath1 , it is possible to study the scaling relations between the gas fraction ( @xmath5 ) , entropy ( @xmath6 ) , and temperature where the gas fraction and entropy are of great interest to constrain cosmological parameters and to understand the thermodynamic history of cluster or group formations , respectively ( see , e.g. ,",

    "two energy bands of 0.58.0 and 0.41.0kev were used , with the latter energy band chosen to check for contamination due to swcx .",

    "our results of the @xmath6@xmath7 relation also suggest that bias in temperature is needed .",

    "although the collisional ionization timescale can be much longer , the plasma in antlia should still be in cie near @xmath1 unless its shock radius is smaller than about @xmath4 .",

    "the corrected entropy for massive clusters is still lower than the baseline model .",

    "counterintuitively , the dynamically youngest antlia is surprisingly relaxed compared with some other dynamically older groups .",
    "observations in other directions of antlia are needed to test whether this is due to azimuthal variation .",
    "the dynamically older cool core virgo appears to be strongly heated to a very high entropy out to @xmath2@xmath3 , presumably by the strong agn feedback .",
    "while one of the dynamically evolved fossil groups , eso 3060170 , appears to be relaxed , the other fossil group , rx j1159 + 5531 ( with full azimuthal coverage ) , deviates significantly from the universal pressure profile .",
    "thus , we observe a diversity of icm properties for different low mass groups .",
    "while massive clusters sometimes show an entropy deficit and an excess in gas fraction near @xmath1 , there is no such evidence for the lower mass groups we considered .",
    "this suggests that clumping and other non - equilibrium processes in low mass groups might not be as significant as in the high mass systems .",
    "we argued that current data are not sensitive enough to distinguish or address the contributions of different models to explain the entropy and gas fraction deviations in massive cluster outskirts .",
    "more observations spanning a wide range of mass and more complete azimuthal coverage , as well as more theoretical efforts , are needed to understand the outskirts of galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "a direct detection of clumps and non - equilibrium effects in cluster outskirts may be possible with future missions , such as the _ smart - x _ version of the _ x - ray surveyor _ mission concept and the _ athena _ observatory @xcite .",
