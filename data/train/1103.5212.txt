    "recent advances in plasmonics , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the use of surface plasmons for subwavelength optics ,  @xcite have led to renewed interest in the physics of plasmon excitations bound to smooth or rough surfaces .",
    "@xcite in particular , it has been proposed to transport electromagnetic energy along linear chains of nanoparticles ,  @xcite possibly embedded in a gain medium ,  @xcite and proof - of - principle experiments have been made .",
    "@xcite in such setups , fabrication - induced shape imperfections of the nanoparticles inevitably will result in slight shifts of their resonance frequencies , and it might be crucial to estimate the maximum size of such fluctuations which can still be tolerated .",
    "@xcite although sophisticated numerical methods for computing the optical response of nanoparticles do exist ,  @xcite it would still be helpful to have a flexible analytical tool which exploits the fact that the shape of an unintentionally deformed nanoparticle is close to some theoretical ideal , as this tool would allow one to explore the huge parameter space of possible perturbations in a computationally cheap manner .",
    "in the present paper we develop such a perturbative approach to the computation of surface resonances .",
    "our strategy is quite general , relying on concepts borrowed from differential geometry .",
    "@xcite the mathematical arguments are given in the following sec .",
    "[ s_pert ] ; some technical details have been deferred to appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "the main results are the expressions  ( [ res ] ) and ( [ var ] ) , which quantify the shifts of the resonance frequencies to first order in the deformation strength .",
    "section  [ s_exam ] then provides three illustrative examples .",
    "the first two of these make contact with analytically solvable models , thus helping to gain confidence in the formalism , while the third one is a more realistic application to a deformed nanosphere for which no closed analytical solution is available .",
    "this necessitates to consider the splitting of degenerate modes , which is done in appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "[ s_conc ] .",
    "consider a volume @xmath0 filled with a dielectric medium which is characterized by an isotropic , frequency - dependent dielectric function @xmath1 ; this volume @xmath2 be surrounded by vacuum .",
    "we employ the quasistatic approximation , which is valid if the characteristic linear extensions of @xmath2 are small in comparison with the wavelengths of impinging radiation , and thus captures essential features of nonretarded plasmon dynamics in small nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite the fourier components @xmath3 of the potential then are given by the solutions to the set of equations @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the restriction of @xmath6 to the interior @xmath2 and @xmath7 its restriction to the open exterior @xmath8 ; both @xmath5 and @xmath7 are smooth everywhere except at the boundary @xmath9 .",
    "we stipulate that @xmath9 be sufficiently smooth to substantiate the following operations , and suppress the dependence of @xmath6 on the frequency @xmath10 altogether .",
    "the expressions @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) are the derivatives of the potential in the direction of the outward unit normal @xmath12 .",
    "observe that at this point the knowledge of the dielectric function @xmath1 is not yet required .",
    "rather , we take @xmath13 on the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) as a real number and regard it as an eigenvalue , henceforth dubbed as _ plasmonic eigenvalue _",
    ", if the system  ( [ eq1 ] )  ( [ eq3 ] ) with that particular @xmath13 possesses a nontrivial solution  @xmath6 which vanishes at least quadratically with increasing distance from @xmath14 .",
    "this nomenclature is formally justified by reformulating the system  ( [ eq1 ] )  ( [ eq3 ] ) in terms of dirichlet - to - neumann operators , so that the desired values of @xmath13 explicitly appear as inverse eigenvalues of a combination of such operators .",
    "@xcite this somewhat unfamiliar view offers conceptual advantages : on the one hand , the material - specific aspects of the problem , embodied in the function @xmath1 , are separated from the geometric ones ; only these geometric aspects matter when studying deformations of @xmath2 . on the other hand , standard theorems concerning the behavior of eigenvalues of linear operators under perturbations can now be employed .",
    "after such a plasmonic eigenvalue has been found for a particular geometry , _ i.e. _ , for some domain @xmath2 with a given shape , that eigenvalue then determines the frequency @xmath15 of a surface resonance through the equation @xmath16 .",
    "for example , a half space with planar boundary @xmath9 yields @xmath17 , and the dielectric function can be taken as @xmath18 for metallic materials with plasma frequency @xmath19 , describing the free electron motion .",
    "this then leads to the familiar expression @xmath20 for the surface plasmon resonance at a planar metal - vacuum interface in the quasistatic limit .",
    "@xcite typical plasma frequencies for good conductors are on the order of @xmath21  s@xmath22 .",
    "we now consider the response of a plasmonic eigenvalue @xmath13 to a small deformation of @xmath2 .",
    "this deformation is modeled in terms of a shape function @xmath23 and a dimensionless parameter  @xmath24 , such that the surface of the deformed volume is given by @xmath25 we assume that one has solutions @xmath26 , @xmath27 to the problem ( [ eq1 ] )  ( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath2 replaced by @xmath28 , and that @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend differentiably on @xmath24 .",
    "we denote the derivatives in @xmath24 by a dot and write @xmath29 and @xmath30 for brevity .    in what follows",
    "we derive a system of equations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and therefrom an explicit expression for @xmath31 . to this end , we take the derivative of the system ( [ eq1 ] )  ( [ eq3 ] ) with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "first , for any @xmath33 one has @xmath34 for @xmath24 sufficiently close to zero ; therefore , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) readily yields @xmath35 next we differentiate eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . in a more explicit form ,",
    "this equation reads @xmath36 and hence gives @xmath37 or @xmath38 where eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) has been used for eliminating @xmath7 .",
    "similarly we differentiate eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , keeping in mind that @xmath11 , and taking into account that @xmath12 also depends on @xmath24 .",
    "thus , one has @xmath39 the required derivatives @xmath40 and @xmath41 are calculated in appendix  [ app1 ] . according to eq .",
    "( [ re1 ] ) , @xmath42 coincides with the negative gradient of the shape function inside the surface @xmath9 , while eq .",
    "( [ re2 ] ) expresses @xmath41 in terms of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath43 applied to @xmath44 , and the mean curvature @xmath45 of @xmath9 . combining these results",
    ", we find @xmath46 thus , taking the @xmath24-derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) leads to @xmath47 the l.h.s .",
    "now vanishes identically , and the third term on the r.h.s.vanishes because of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) itself .",
    "moreover , since @xmath48 on @xmath9 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , and @xmath49 differentiates inside @xmath9 only , we can replace @xmath50 by @xmath51 in the second term , finally leaving us with @xmath52 in summary , the differentiation of the homogeneous system ( [ eq1 ] )  ( [ eq3 ] ) has led to the inhomogeneous system @xmath53 where @xmath54 since the homogeneous system has a nontrivial solution ( the given @xmath6 ) , its inhomogeneous descendant can admit a solution only if the right hand sides @xmath55 , @xmath56 satisfy a certain compatibility condition .",
    "since by assumption there is a solution ( the @xmath24-derivative of the given family @xmath27 ) , this condition actually is fulfilled , and yields an expression for @xmath31 . for deriving this expression , we start from @xmath57 in @xmath2 .",
    "green s formula then gives @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the surface area element .",
    "thus , one has @xmath60 a corresponding identity holds for @xmath7 , @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 since @xmath63 on @xmath9 , the l.h.s .  becomes @xmath64 on the other hand , since @xmath65 on @xmath9 , the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) takes the form @xmath66 equating these two expressions ( [ ex1 ] ) and ( [ ex2 ] ) , and solving for @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath67 inserting the formulas ( [ fof ] ) and ( [ fog ] ) for @xmath55 and @xmath68 , and performing an integration by parts , the numerator reduces to @xmath69 thus , the desired expression for the first - order change of the plasmonic eigenvalue @xmath13 with the deformation strength  @xmath24 finally reads @xmath70 this is the principal result of the present work .",
    "observe that @xmath71 implies @xmath72 so that the denominator is positive .",
    "of course , @xmath31 can likewise be expressed entirely in terms of @xmath7 : @xmath73",
    "consider an infinite half - space geometry with the dielectric medium filling the volume @xmath74 , so that its boundary is given by the plane @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 be a two - dimensional wave vector , with @xmath77 .",
    "solutions to laplace s equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) which vanish for @xmath78 then are given by @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and the continuity condition  ( [ eq2 ] ) yields @xmath82 . moreover , since @xmath44 is real , one has @xmath83 . at this point ,",
    "the amplitudes @xmath84 describing the excitations at an exactly planar surface are arbitrary .",
    "the normal and the in - plane derivatives at @xmath85 then are @xmath86 respectively , so that the condition  ( [ eq3 ] ) immediately provides the well known eigenvalue @xmath17 for this particular geometry .",
    "we write @xmath87 together with @xmath88 giving @xmath89 now we introduce a small deformation of the planar surface , described by some suitable shape function @xmath90 .",
    "the required amplitudes @xmath84 consequently are determined by that deformation ; the assumption that the exact potential @xmath91 can still be written in the form ( [ upr ] ) or ( [ umr ] ) constitutes the rayleigh hypothesis .",
    "@xcite upon inserting the fourier transform of the shape function , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath92 und using @xmath17 for the unperturbed eigenvalue , either eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) or its variant ( [ var ] ) readily yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the unit vector in the direction of @xmath95 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath96 , one has @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 : the plasmonic eigenvalue does not change when the entire surface plane is displaced by some amount  @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , there exists an exact integral equation for determining the amplitudes @xmath84 associated with a given surface deformation , derived by farias and maradudin on the basis of the rayleigh hypothesis :  @xcite @xmath100 with @xmath101 this has been applied by maradudin and visscher to the study of particular perturbations of planar surfaces .",
    "@xcite expanding the latter expression  ( [ tle ] ) to first order in @xmath24 gives @xmath102 so that eq .",
    "( [ mar ] ) becomes @xmath103 for sufficiently weak perturbations .",
    "recalling that the unperturbed eigenvalue is @xmath104 , we insert @xmath105 into the denominator on the l.h.s . multiplying both sides by @xmath106 , integrating , and rearranging then yields @xmath107 with @xmath31 indeed formally equal to the previous eq .",
    "( [ pep ] ) .",
    "thus , our perturbative result is consistent with the formula  ( [ mar ] ) .    a second example which allows one to confirm the validity of the perturbative approach by analytical means is provided by the deformation of a dielectric sphere of radius  @xmath108 into a spheroid .",
    "in this case the unperturbed potential is written as @xmath109 valid for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath112 denote the familiar spherical harmonics .",
    "the restriction to these basis functions with @xmath113 , which do not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath114 , confines us to deformations which preserve the rotation symmetry around the @xmath115-axis . from condition  ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "one gets @xmath116 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) then leads to the eigenvalues @xmath117 in particular , @xmath118 characterizes the dipole resonance .",
    "@xcite    we deform the sphere into a spheroid oriented along the @xmath115-axis , employing the shape function @xmath119 here the choice of the sphere s radius @xmath108 as the scale of the deformation is a matter of convenience .",
    "the three degenerate dipole modes of the sphere are shifted when the deformation strength  @xmath24 adopts nonzero values , such that the mode associated with the @xmath115-axis splits off from the two others . for estimating the corresponding change of @xmath120 for small @xmath24 , we use @xmath121 and calculate @xmath122 on @xmath9 , giving @xmath123 plugged into eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) , this yields @xmath124 this easily obtainable result can be checked against the exactly known expression for the dipolar @xmath115-mode of a spheroid :  @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes the so - called depolarization coefficient , given by  @xcite @xmath127 with @xmath128 thus , @xmath129 becomes small with @xmath24 , allowing us to expand @xmath130 as @xmath131 exploiting eq .",
    "( [ exe ] ) one expresses @xmath126 in terms of @xmath24 , finding @xmath132 this tells us that @xmath120 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ ep1 ] ) , should be expanded in powers of @xmath133 : @xmath134 inserting eq .",
    "( [ exl ] ) , we obtain @xmath135 in accordance with the result  ( [ pre ] ) of perturbation theory .",
    "the following third example concerns a deformed nanosphere which does not admit an analytical solution in closed form , so that the accuracy achieved by first - order perturbation theory has to be ascertained by comparison with numerical calculations .",
    "this is exactly the type of application we have in mind , since here eqs .",
    "( [ res ] ) and ( [ var ] ) provide a quick and reliable estimate of the possibly detrimental consequences of geometrical imperfections ,  @xcite without hard requirements on computational resources .",
    "we assume that the ideal sphere is distorted by two gaussian protrusions , and parametrize its surface as @xmath136 with @xmath137 denoting the dimensionless euclidean distance between the two points on the unit sphere specified by the angles @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "the protrusions parameters are chosen , somewhat arbitrarily , as @xmath140 , @xmath141 for their amplitudes , @xmath142 , @xmath143 for their gaussian widths , and @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , @xmath147 for their locations .",

    "employed as example for demonstrating the accuracy of the perturbative approach .",
    "the deviation of the scaled surface radii @xmath149 from their ideal value  @xmath150 is visualized here for @xmath148 . ]",
    "this example also illustrates a further important issue . while the dipole modes of a perfect sphere are threefold degenerate , this degeneracy",
    "is removed entirely by the distortion  ( [ nsp ] ) .",
    "thus , there now are three branches of dipole - like eigenvalues , and our previous analysis applies to each branch separately , provided the starting point is chosen appropriately : the expressions  ( [ res ] ) and ( [ var ] ) refer to the individual branches , if the proper linear combinations of the unperturbed degenerate modes are inserted . the problem how to find these linear combinations",
    "is solved in appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "basically , the numerator of the formula  ( [ res ] ) defines a quadratic form of the eigenmodes ( see eq .",
    "( [ qua ] ) ) ; the required proper linear combinations of the unperturbed modes are those which diagonalize this form . their determination , and the evaluation of the ensuing surface integrals determining @xmath31 for all three branches , does not demand much numerical effort . figure  [ f_2 ] shows the perturbative results for deformation strengths @xmath151 in comparison with data obtained by nonperturbative numerical computations .",
    "@xcite quite remarkably , first - order perturbation theory still produces excellent results when the shape variation already is quite substantial , that is , for values of @xmath24 up to @xmath152 ; even for @xmath24 as large as @xmath153 one obtains good estimates .",
    "( crosses ) , in comparison with the results of first - order perturbation theory ( full lines ) . ]",
    "the first - order perturbative expression  ( [ res ] ) or ( [ var ] ) for the shift of a plasmonic eigenvalue clearly has a limited range of applicability , insofar as it is restricted to sufficiently weak deformations , but it stands out because of its generality , and easy use . together with similar results for higher derivatives ,  @xcite one obtains a formal perturbation series @xmath154 above we have simply assumed the existence of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "given a solution at @xmath155 , this existence actually follows from the reformulation of the problem in terms of dirichlet - to - neumann operators ,  @xcite and from standard perturbation theory for eigenvalues .",
    "if @xmath13 is @xmath156-fold degenerate ( as in the case of the sphere ) , then one has @xmath156 branches @xmath157 , @xmath158 ; @xmath159 . the analysis of sec .",

    "( [ qua ] ) .",
    "the three examples we have given in sec .  [ s_exam ] vary in character , the first two recovering known analytical results and thus confirming the correctness of our formal line of reasoning .",
    "the third example , summarized by figs .",
    "[ f_1 ] and [ f_2 ] , demonstrates the utility of our approach for practical purposes .",
    "here we have dealt with an asymmetrically deformed nanosphere , and obtained fairly good estimates for the shifted dipole modes .",
    "if we assume that tolerances on the order of 5% can be met in nanosphere fabrication , first - order perturbation theory thus allows one to quantify the effects of a large variety of possible shape fluctuations with both sufficent accuracy and only small numerical effort .",
