    "despite of its tremendous phenomenological success , it is believed that the standard model of elementary particle physics is not the ultimate theory of space , time and matter .",
    "in fact , there is a growing number of theoretical proposals for extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , trying to arrive at an even more unified description of particles and their interactions .",
    "very frequently , these extensions exhibit their truly unifying features only at very high energy scales , far above the electroweak ( @xmath1  tev ) scale currently probed by the lhc .",
    "however , at the same time , these unified theories predict very often a rich low - energy phenomenology arising from very weakly interacting sub - ev particles ( wisps ) beyond the sm .    as the first and paradigmatic example we find the axion  @xcite and other axion - like particles ( alps ) ,",
    "the smallness of their mass being related to a shift symmetry of the field theory of the corresponding axion field @xmath2 under the transformation @xmath3 .",
    "such a symmetry forbids explicit mass terms , @xmath4 , in the lagrangian , rendering the particles corresponding to the excitations of the field @xmath2 massless .",
    "moreover , it leads to the fact that the couplings of axions and alps to standard model particles can only occur via derivative couplings , @xmath5 , leading to a strong suppression of their interactions at energy scales below @xmath6 , their decay constant , promoting them to perfect wisp candidates  @xcite .",
    "alps may have also non - zero , but still small masses , @xmath7 , arising from terms in the low energy effective lagrangian which break the shift symmetry explicitly at a scale @xmath8 .",
    "this occurs especially for the proper axion @xmath9 ( sometimes called peccei - quinn axion or qcd axion ) whose shift symmetry is broken by a qcd colour anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the latter has the virtue of solving the `` strong cp problem '' by promoting the cp violating parameter @xmath10 in qcd essentially to a field @xmath11 , which dynamically relaxes to zero , thereby explaining the apparent smallness of strong cp violation .",
    "moreover , for @xmath12  gev , the axions would be perfect candidates for the observed  yet unidentified  dark matter of the universe  @xcite .",
    "besides the axion , unifying theories beyond the sm , in particular string theory , appear to predict a possibly large number of alps  @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically most important is the alp field coupling to two photons , which generically has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electromagnetic field strength , @xmath15 its dual , and @xmath16 , with fine - structure constant @xmath17 .",
    "the couplings and for pseudoscalar and scalar alps , respectively , provide photon - alp mixing in a background electromagnetic field  @xcite , which produces photon - alp oscillations that can be searched for in a variety of contexts ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , including dedicated laboratory searches , in particular in light shining through a wall experiments  @xcite . interestingly , puzzling astronomical observations such as the recently reported anomalous transparency of the universe to gamma - rays , the alignment of distant quasar polarizations or the unexplained scatter in luminosity relations may find their explanation in terms of such a photon - alp mixing  @xcite .",
    "similarly the fast cooling of white dwarfs may hint at an alp coupling to electrons with a comparable strength  @xcite .",
    "the rich phenomenology of photon - alp oscillations extends to other well - motivated wisps , in particular to so - called hidden photons  @xcite .",
    "in fact , light , extra hidden u(1 ) gauge bosons occur very frequently in unified theories beyond the standard model  @xcite . in general , these hidden photons will mix with the standard photon via a kinetic mixing term , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the field strength of the hidden photon , which can obtain a mass from either a hidden higgs or a stueckelberg mechanism .",
    "the predicted values of the kinetic mixing , @xmath20 , are widespread and depend strongly on the particular extension of the sm .",
    "typical numbers in string embeddings of the sm lie in the broad range @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the term can be reabsorbed in the definition of the electric charge if the hidden photon mass is exactly zero , effectively removing hidden photons ( @xmath22s ) from the theory , forbidding @xmath23 oscillations .",
    "this is , however , not the case if there are light states charged under the local hidden u(1 ) symmetry associated with the hidden photon . in this case , these particles acquire a small electric charge  @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the unit charge of the hidden u(1 ) , and their radiative effects in a background magnetic field still allow @xmath23 transitions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on the results of a search for photon oscillations into general weakly coupled particles at desy : the `` any - light - particle - search '' ( alps ) .",
    "our experiment is based on the `` light shining through a wall '' concept  @xcite : laser light is shone through a background magnetic field onto a wall .",
    "we are searching for photons which seemingly made it through the wall by double conversion , @xmath26 , through the wisp intermediate state .",
    "the alps experiment has been already described in detail in a previous publication  @xcite . in this section",
    "we summarize the experimental setup and give details of the crucial upgrades that have made possible the physics results we present in this paper .    a simplified schematic view of the alps experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "our light source is the mopa laser system producing up to 35 w of 1064 nm laser light  @xcite used by us previously  @xcite . to adapt to the detector efficiency we double the frequency of the beam with a non - linear ppktp crystal .",
    "this beam is directed into a vacuum pipe in which photon - wisp conversions could occur . inside the pipe , an optical resonator is used to increase the laser power , enhancing proportionally a hypothetically wisp flux .",
    "any wisps produced will traverse a thick light absorber ( henceforth , the `` wall '' ) and enter into a second vacuum pipe where they can reconvert into photons .",
    "the wisp production and photon regeneration pipes are inserted from both sides of a hera superconducting dipole magnet .",
    "the hera dipole provides a magnetic field of @xmath27  t in a length of @xmath28  m ( yellow in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , and its presence allows photon conversions into wisps with spin different from one , such as axion - like particles .",
    "photons reconverted from wisps appear in the regeneration tube ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) with the same beam characteristics as the photons they are originating from , i.e. with the same frequency and the same tem@xmath29 mode to which the resonator is locked .",
    "the end of the regeneration tube is connected to a light - tight box in which signal photons are redirected by a mirror into a lens ( focal length @xmath30 mm ) which focuses the light onto a @xmath31 m diameter beam spot on our ccd camera .",
    "the crucial upgrades with respect to the previous setup @xcite are : the incorporation of a _ resonant _ second harmonic generation scheme to increase the available laser power , a higher power build - up in the production resonator , the system for tuning the photon index of refraction in the production / regeneration pipes ( which affects photon@xmath32wisp oscillations , see below ) and the incorporation of a new ccd with reduced noise and a higher quantum efficiency .      in order to increase the available laser power , a folded ring shaped resonator was built around the nonlinear ppktp crystal ( periodically poled ktiopo@xmath33 ) used for the second harmonic generation ( shg ) . with the help of the photodiode pd1 in fig.[fig : setup ] and an electronic feed - back loop the resonator length",
    "is changed in order to keep it resonant with the incident infrared laser light .",
    "simultaneously the production cavity is kept in resonance by pd2 and another feedback loop acting on the frequency of the primary laser ( see next section ) .    in its working point for long - term operation",
    "the resonant shg emits at a wavelength of from an incident power of at . at the input of the production resonator",
    "were constantly available with a very good time stability of typically better than .",
    "high intensities of the fundamental and/or harmonic frequencies inside the crystal cause problematic effects like thermal dephasing , nonlinear absorption processes and gray - tracking  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a resonant shg is that the same amount of converted power can be achieved with a larger fundamental waist inside the crystal .",
    "the reason for this is the nonlinear nature of the shg process .",
    "it causes the power build - up to have a linear effect on the circulating fundamental power while showing a quadratic effect on the second harmonic power .    the optimum waist size for a non - resonant shg with the long ppktp crystal used in the alps setup is . for our resonant shg",
    ", we chose a fundamental waist , 9 times bigger than the single - pass optimum .",
    "a numerical simulation of this resonator results in intensity reduction factors of 15 for the fundamental and 100 for the second harmonic beam smaller than the fundamental , its intensity decreases quadratically with the fundamental waist size . ] .",
    "this holds true as long as the cavity is impedance matched and the parasitic roundtrip losses are significantly smaller than the roundtrip losses due to frequency conversion .",
    "a more detailed explanation of this simulation can be found in  @xcite .    in this way we reduced the above",
    "mentioned problematic effects and still achieved a long - term constant output power of behind the shg ( monitored by pd3 , fig.[fig : setup ] ) .",
    "green output powers above again caused gray - tracking in our setup .",
    "further enlargement of the fundamental beam waist was not possible because ppktp crystals with heights bigger than were not available .      in our previous setup ,",
    "the mirrors of the optical cavity were situated outside the production side vacuum tube , so that the green laser beam had to traverse two glass windows two times in one resonator round trip .",
    "absorption and scattering in these windows ( although ar - coated ) limited the achievable power build - up . by placing the mirrors inside the vacuum ,",
    "the internal losses of the production resonator in the current setup were reduced by roughly an order of magnitude , boosting the power build - up by the same factor . the green light generated in the shg stage",
    "is directed through the entrance window of the cylindrical vacuum chamber onto the coupling mirror ( cm , radius of curvature @xmath34 m , @xmath35 \" diameter ) of the cavity . using two uhv picomotors",
    "@xcite the cm mount is adjustable from the outside . due to degradation during cavity operation",
    "( see below ) , two cm mirrors with transmission coefficients of @xmath36 resp .",
    "@xmath37 and two cavity end mirrors ( em , @xmath38 ) with @xmath39 resp . @xmath40 had to be used successively . for em a special mirror holder was designed which is non - magnetic and suitable for high vacuum . with two adapted squiggle  @xcite motors",
    "the mirror mount in the holder can be tilted remotely around two axes perpendicular to the beam and to each other . by guiding it in with a segmented aluminum rod ,",
    "the mirror holder is slid into the laser side tube from the outer to the inner end just before the exit window .",
    "the rod carries the teflon - coated motor wire ribbon .",
    "these efforts resulted in a power build - up factor of and a continuously circulating power inside the production region of up to .",
    "this corresponds to a more than 30-fold increase compared to the setup in  @xcite .",
    "the power inside the cavity is monitored at all times by two different means : by measuring the incident power reflected from the cm ( with pd2 , fig.[fig : setup ] , as explained in  @xcite ) and by a photovoltaic cell with a sensitive area of @xmath41 exposed to the stray light exiting the cm chamber through a viewing port .",
    "when operating in vacuum , the power build - up degrades after several of running .",
    "we have found that this is due to a slight mirror quality degradation , despite operating several orders of magnitude below the damage threshold specified by the manufacturer .      in order to tune the index of refraction",
    ", both vacuum chambers may be closed off from their turbopumps and filled with @xmath42 pure argon .",
    "the pressures of both chambers are monitored with two baratron  @xcite manometers .",
    "the pressure increases due to outgassing turned out to be smaller than 5% in each measurement run . since the refractive indexes for outgassing contaminants like water , h@xmath43 or air do not surpass that of argon , the relative change of the refractive index in the chambers due to outgassing is estimated to not surpass the relative pressure change .",
    "[ fig : sb ]      as detector we use a commercial ccd camera pixis 1024b  @xcite with an 1024@xmath411024 array of @xmath44 sized pixels .",
    "it operates at @xmath45 @xmath46c and has 96% quantum efficiency at 532 nm .",
    "the dark current and read - out are 0.001 @xmath47/pixel / s and 3.8 @xmath47/pixel rms , respectively .",
    "the diameter of the focused beam is @xmath48 m which would cover several pixels . in order to lower the readout noise",
    ", we binned groups of @xmath49 pixels for the readout . by doing this ,",
    "@xmath50 of the light arriving to the detector is contained in the same @xmath51 binned pixel .",
    "henceforth we will refer as pixels to what are actually bins of pixels . for exposures longer than @xmath52 hour the dark current noise dominates the total noise of the ccd . hence , to not spoil the sensitivity of the camera , the exposure times have to be well above 30 minutes .",
    "we took 1 hour frames , because with much longer exposures the probability of spurious signals from cosmics or radioactivity close to the expected beam spot region rises . if such signals are observed the data frame",
    "is omitted .",
    "special care was devoted to a stable and rigid construction of the detector breadboard containing the light - tight box and the camera , for it has to be removed for accessing the wall inside the magnet . after mounting or dismounting the wall",
    ", the detector bench has to be repositioned very precisely to maintain the alignment on the pre - selected pixel . with numerous tests the error in repositioning of the beam spot position on the ccd was determined to be smaller than @xmath53 m .",
    "a further cross check of the alignment stability is provided by a reference beam which , being extracted from the back of the mirror that guides the laser into the cavity , is conducted through a pipe parallel to the hera magnet to be finally redirected and focused onto another pixel of the ccd .",
    "displacements of the reference beam spot in the ccd are used to signal maladjustments in those elements , which would also alter the expected position of the spot created by lsw .",

    "we open the reference beam shutter to test the reference beam pointing stability . after the last frame of the session",
    "we remove the wall and check that the position of the signal pixel has not moved . to characterize the background of the ccd we take a large number of frames with the laser turned off so that the statistical accuracy is always limited just by the number of the signal frames .",
    "the footprint of lsw is searched for by comparing the adu values of the signal pixel in the set of signal frames with those of the background set ( 1 adu@xmath54 ) . before the comparison ,",
    "however , a selection of frames and a correction for frame - dependent baseline fluctuations is performed .",
    "every frame is checked for hot pixels and spurious signs from cosmics or radioactivity in a region of 25@xmath4125 pixels around the signal pixel .",
    "frames with such activities are omitted from the data analysis .",
    "the fluctuations are accounted for by subtracting the average of a @xmath55 array of pixels around the signal pixel from the adu value of the signal pixel .",
    "this difference is called adured ( for adu reduced ) in the following .",
    "the lsw flux can be estimated by comparing the mean of the distribution of adured values in the sets of signal and background frames .",

    "finally , in the absence of any evidence for lsw , a confidence level is obtained by the method of feldman and cousins  @xcite .    as a direct test of the whole setup and methodology we took a set of 4 frames _ without the wall _ and a set of attenuators placed in the way of the beam to the ccd .",

    "an assumption that holds in the cases considered in the following  but depend upon the wisp under consideration . in order to cover all the interesting candidates , we took frames in three different configurations : with polarization parallel to the magnetic field , perpendicular to it , or with the magnetic field turned off .",

    "this was achieved by introducing ar gas at a pressure of @xmath91  mbar .",
    "we must emphasize that this is not equivalent to restoring @xmath92-alp coherence , which would correspond to make @xmath93 , but to increase the @xmath92-alp relative phase velocity to have an extra half oscillation length ( an extra phase of @xmath94 ) in our available magnetic field length .",

    "interestingly , a hidden photon in this mass region could appear as an extra contribution to the cosmic radiation density during the epoch after big bang nucleosynthesis and before recombination  @xcite  a puzzling possibility supported ( albeit with less than @xmath101 significance ) by the recent analysis of wmap data  @xcite leading to a value of the effective number of neutrinos higher than the standard value of three by an amount @xmath102 . as seen from fig .",

    "it is increasingly evident that this is the way to go for a new generation of laboratory experiments looking for wisps . in order to compete with the strong astrophysical considerations that normally challenge the existence of wisps the next generation will have to push four basic frontiers : stronger magnets , more laser power in the production region , more sophisticated low - background detectors and the implementation of the promising resonant regeneration technique  @xcite worked out in experimental details recently  @xcite .",
    "these efforts could not await a more exciting reward .",
    "for instance , testing hidden photons with @xmath119 for @xmath120 would mean entering in a territory where hidden photons could signal properties of the extra dimensions predicted by string theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , reaching sensitivities to the alp photon couplings in the range @xmath121  gev@xmath122 for @xmath123  ev would allow to definitively test the alp interpretation of the puzzling astronomical observations mentioned in the introduction .",
