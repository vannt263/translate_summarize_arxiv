    "since the discovery of high-@xmath1 superconductivity , there has been much effort to elucidate the properties of doped mott insulators . in this context , the specific case of one hole in a mott insulating antiferromagnet ( half filled band ) has been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "these studies address the basic question , whether the motion of a hole in the antiferromagnet can possibly be described within a quasiparticle approach .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy provides valuable information that can help resolve this issue .",
    "experimental results from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) are now available for sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 as well as for ca@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "both these materials are mott insulators and are parent compounds of the high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "the results from arpes can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the spectral features observed are _ not _ sharp at all .",
    "quite to the contrary , an intrinsic broad feature extending to energies of the order of 1.5 ev before merging into the main valence band is seen .",
    "this is to be contrasted with sharp spectral features that one expects in a quasiparticle scenario ; ( ii ) the observed dispersion is isotropic around @xmath3 ; ( iii ) the measurements of ronning _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reveal the presence of a so - called remnant fermi surface of the momentum structure in the energy - integrated spectral function .",
    "the broad spectral features seen in arpes strongly suggest the breakdown of the quasiparticle picture . based on such considerations ,",
    "laughlin @xcite conjectured the failure of quasiparticle theory in these materials , and further proposed , that the observed isotropic dispersion has its origins in an underlying spinon spectrum .",
    "this picture envisages spin - charge separation with the scale of the observed dispersion determined by the superexchange @xmath4 .",
    "an entirely different picture is presented by the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) approach @xcite .",
    "though this scheme is based on the @xmath0 model , it depicts a spin - polaron picture for the single hole case where the doped hole behaves not very different from a quasiparticle in the landau - fermi liquid theory .",
    "the scba results have also been supported by exact numerical calculations on finite lattices @xcite up to 32 sites @xcite as well as variational calculations on larger lattices@xcite . here",
    ", the consistency amongst different numerical methods mostly concerns the spectrum @xmath5 , usually defined as the _ minimum _ energy for a given momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the spectrum is _ anisotropic _ around the `` fermi points '' @xmath7 in all these calculations .",
    "it is called a `` quasiparticle '' spectrum since a sharp peak in the spectral function usually appears at @xmath5 in both the scba as well as results from exact diagonalization .",
    "note that these results are _ not _ consistent with arpes which exhibits an _",
    "dispersion around @xmath8 , and rather broad spectral features .",
    "thus , to account for the former , the inclusion of second ( @xmath9 ) and third ( @xmath10 ) nearest neighbor hoppings to the @xmath0 model have been proposed in the literature @xcite . however , this approach is meaningful only when the quasiparticle description holds , _",
    "i.e. _ , only if a sharp quasiparticle peak exists at @xmath5 in the @xmath0 model . as illustrated in fig",
    ". 1 , if in the thermodynamic limit , the spectral function for a given momentum @xmath6 does not show a sharp quasiparticle peak , then , notwithstanding how accurately @xmath5 is determined by various theoretical methods , it has no experimental    = 5.0 cm    implication . for , in this case , the higher energy @xmath11 at the broad `` peak '' in fig .",
    "1 , which is observable experimentally , may have nothing to do with the anisotropic @xmath5 .    on more general grounds ,",
    "the breakdown of the landau - fermi quasiparticle picture has been discussed by anderson for a doped mott insulator in the presence of an upper hubbard band @xcite .",
    "he argues that the quasiparticle weight @xmath12 vanishes due to unrenormalizable fermi - surface phase shifts induced when a particle is injected into the mott insulator .",
    "indeed , based on a rigorous formulation of the single - electron green s function in the one - hole case using the @xmath0 model , it has been demonstrated@xcite that the quasiparticle weight @xmath12 at the fermi surface must vanish in the thermodynamic limit due to the presence of the phase string effect .",
    "such a phase string effect can be considered as the equivalent of the phase shifts proposed by anderson in the hubbard model .    this paper concerns the effect of the aforementioned phase string on the dynamics of a single hole introduced in an antiferromagnet .",
    "we show how the phase string leads to the frustration of kinetic energy of the hole .",
    "we then show that the phase string effect is related to spin - charge separation and that the charge carrier is actually a spinless holon .",
    "we find that the holon propagator is localized in space , owing to the phase string .",
    "this is in contrast to the prediction of scba that the hole behaves as a landau quasiparticle .",
    "our result for the holon propagator is consistent with an earlier conclusion that the quasiparticle weight is zero for the doped hole @xcite .",
    "it does not necessarily contradict finite - size calculations , as the localization length scale turns out to be much larger than typical sample sizes in numerical studies .",
    "we find the only coherent object to be a neutral spinon excitation created by the doped hole whose energy spectrum is responsible for an isotropic `` quasiparticle '' dispersion .",
    "thus , our results provide a natural explanation of the arpes results and support the conjecture made in ref .. we also discuss how the observed line shapes reflect spin - charge separation , and finally , in the appendix , how the remnant fermi surface structure may be understood as a peculiar consequence of the phase string effect at higher energies .",
    "in this section , we examine the effects induced by the motion of a single hole in an antiferromagnetic background . in sec .",
    "iia , we shall review a few basic results of the slave - fermion formalism .",
    "we then go on to discuss the effect of the phase string on the kinetic energy of the hole , spin - charge separation and the localization of the holon due to the phase string .",
    "we begin with the slave - fermion representation @xmath13@xcite and express the @xmath0 model @xmath14 in the following form : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18    at half - filling , the bosonic resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) description given by liang , doucot , and anderson @xcite has provided by far , the most accurate picture ( see fig .",
    "2 ) for both long - range as well as short - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "= 5.0 cm    in this theory , it is found@xcite that the long - range af correlations , including the af long - range order ( aflro ) occurring in the thermodynamic limit , constitute only a _ small _ fraction of the ground - state energy and the dominant contribution mainly comes from the _ short - range _ rvb correlations .",
    "thus , the ground state at half - filling may be regarded as aflro + rvb , of which , aflro is the most vulnerable part easily removed by either temperature or doping with little energy cost .",
    "the mean - field version of this bosonic rvb description is known as the schwinger - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft)@xcite .",
    "this theory works quite well at half - filling , and is characterized by a bosonic rvb order parameter @xmath19    but away from half - filling , the problem is highly nontrivial .",
    "the reason can be attributed to the fact that the hopping integral @xmath20 in @xmath21 .",
    "this is generally true due to the sign @xmath22 appearing in ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "so the motion of the hole will be very sensitive to how the spin backflow @xmath23 is treated which is a non - perturbative problem and is the key issue to be dealt with in the present work .    in scba approach@xcite",
    ", the hole can acquire some kinetic energy through the _ dynamic fluctuations _ of @xmath23 . in this approach ,",
    "only the long wavelength fluctuations associated with aflro is considered , where @xmath23 is approximated in large-@xmath24 ( spin wave ) expansion@xcite by @xmath25,\\ ] ] in which @xmath26 denotes the condensed part of the schwinger boson field , corresponding to aflro @xcite .",
    "now , the hopping of the hole is assisted by the fluctuations of @xmath27 .",
    "this is the idea behind the scba , and within this approach it has been found that the hole behaves just like a landau quasiparticle , known as the spin - polaron , with four fermi points at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we reemphasize that within this approximation only the _ long - wavelength _ fluctuations associated with aflro are involved , and the dominant _ short - range _ rvb correlations , which are independent of aflro characterized by @xmath29 , are completely neglected .",
    "the validity of the scba approach is based on the presumption that spin mismatches , described by the spin backflow @xmath23 induced by the hopping of the hole , can be repaired through spin flip process in @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the final state of the hole , after traversing a closed path through the antiferromagnetic background , is identical to its initial state .",
    "this would be true if one focuses only on , say , the @xmath31-component of the spins .",
    "but since we are dealing with a quantum spin system in which each spin has three components that do not commute with one another , there will actually be three components in the spin mismatches induced by the motion of the hole .",
    "for the spin-1/2 case , it has been explicitly proven@xcite that such string - like spin defects _ can not _ be simultaneously repaired through @xmath30 . once the spin configuration ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath31-component ) disordered by the hole hopping is restored by spin flips at low energy ,",
    "a string defect in the transverse components remains , which is described by a sequence of signs in the quantum description of the hole .",
    "this defect is called the phase string@xcite .",
    "the effect of this phase string , as we shall see in the following two subsections , manifests itself both in the expression for the kinetic energy of the hole as well as its propagator .      in this section",
    ", we shall demonstrate that the total energy at momentum @xmath6 for the one - hole case can be exactly formulated as @xmath32 where @xmath33   ( -1)^{n_c^{\\downarrow}}~~.\\ ] ] here , @xmath34 denotes the spin ground - state energy with the hole being _ fixed _ at a given lattice site .",
    "the energy gain due to the hopping arises solely from the second term . in the expression for @xmath35 ,",
    "the summations run over all the possible paths of the hole connecting @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as well as spin configurations , @xmath39 .",
    "the weight functional @xmath40 is positive semi - definite , @xmath41\\geq 0\\ ] ] such that the phase factor @xmath42 is `` uncompensated '' in ( [ m ] ) . here",
    "@xmath43 counts the total number of @xmath44 spins ( or @xmath45 spins by symmetry ) being _ exchanged _ with the hole moving along the path @xmath46 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath47 is the phase string on the path @xmath46 , which was first identified in the exact formulation of the single - electron green s function @xcite .",
    "later we shall see that , owing to the factor @xmath42 , the lowest energy of @xmath48 is obtained for @xmath49 , consistent with numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "= 7.0 cm    from ( [ ge ] ) , ( [ m ] ) and ( [ m ] ) , we come to an important conclusion . without the phase string factor @xmath50 , the total energy would certainly be _ lower _ ( as @xmath51 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath50 represents the frustration on the kinetic energy of the hole .",
    "this effect is ( i ) _ irreparable _ as no other signs can be generated from the spin background to compensate it ; ( ii ) _ singular _ since a change of @xmath52 by @xmath53 will lead to a maximal change in @xmath50 ; and ( iii ) thus expected to dominate the low energy dynamics of the hole . a similar effect is well known in fermionic systems where each fermion s path is also weighted by a `` phase string '' determined by the number of fermions `` exchanged '' with it .",
    "the difference in this case is that the `` exchange '' is between two _ different _ species , the hole and spins .",
    "therefore , such a phase string effect implies an intrinsic _ mutual statistics _ between these two degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the proof of ( [ ge])-([m ] ) is straightforward .",
    "we use the wigner - brillouin formula , @xmath54 '    and @xmath55'$ ] excludes @xmath56 as the intermediate state . here",
    "@xmath57 with @xmath58 denoting the ground state of @xmath30 with the hole localized at a site @xmath36 , _ viz . _ ,",
    "latexmath:[$h_j |\\phi^{(i)}_0\\rangle = e_0     @xmath58 in terms of the complete spin - hole basis @xmath60 ( @xmath61 being a spin configuration with the hole at site @xmath36 ) as @xmath62 . as shown in ref . ,",
    "@xmath63 , which means that the marshall sign rule@xcite still applies to the doped ground state _",
    "if _ the hole is not moving . by inserting the complete set of basis states and following the steps outlined in @xcite for calculating the single - hole propagator , one can easily obtain ( [ ge ] ) , with the weight functional @xmath64 = \\chi^i_{\\phi } \\chi^j_{\\phi'}\\prod_{s=1}^{k-1}\\langle\\phi^{s+1};{(m_s)}|\\hat{p}g_j(e_{\\bf   k})\\hat{p}|\\phi^{s};{(m_s)}\\rangle(-t)~~,\\ ] ] in which @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to spin configurations in intermediate states , and the hole site @xmath67 is on a path @xmath46 connecting two arbitrary sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath68 ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) . following ref . , we can show that @xmath71 as long as @xmath72 ( note that the projection operator @xmath73 ) .",
    "since we are interested in low energy states @xmath74 , the weight functional @xmath40 in ( [ wf ] ) is always positive semi - definite .      in the above subsection",
    ", we showed that the phase string manifests itself as irreparable sign ( phase ) frustrations induced by the hole motion . in this section , we shall establish an intrinsic connection between such a phase string and spin - charge separation .",
    "to this end , let us first consider the origin of the phase string factor @xmath42 in ( [ m ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ b1 ] ) , defining @xmath23 , can be rewritten as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77~~.\\ ] ] here @xmath78 , if an @xmath45 ( @xmath44 ) spinon is _ exchanged _ with the holon at the link @xmath79 . for products around consecutive links enclosing a loop @xmath80 , @xmath81 with @xmath82}=(-1)^{n^{\\downarrow}_{\\gamma}}~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 denotes the total number of @xmath44 spins _ exchanged _ with the hole along the loop @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the phase @xmath84 of the spinon backflow operator ( [ b3 ] ) is the source of the phase string factor in ( [ m ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated by the inset in fig .",
    "3 .    since the ground state satisfies the marshall sign rule@xcite , it is easy to see that @xmath85 ( note that the marshall sign is totally gauged away in the definition of @xmath86 by the sign factor @xmath87 in the slave - fermion decomposition@xcite . )",
    "this is of course consistent with the previous conclusion that the nontrivial phases in the low - energy states all come from the phase string .",
    "a hole slowly hopping around the loop @xmath80 will then acquire a berry s phase @xmath88 given by @xmath89 so the phase string effect generally leads to a nontrivial berry s phase picked up by the hole , as opposed to the quasiparticle picture ( of scba , for instance ) in which the states of the hole before and after traversing a closed path are identical .",
    "now that we have established the connection between the _ phase string effect _ and the _ spinon backflow _ , we are in a position to discuss spin - charge separation .",
    "let us initially suppose that the hole behaves like a quasiparticle with both charge and spin quantum numbers .",
    "this means that the holon and spinon should be confined together . in this case",
    "totally one @xmath45 ( @xmath44 ) spinon will have to be effectively `` transferred '' back from the final location of the hole to the initial location to ensure a precise spin quantum number @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) being transported with the hole .",
    "it then requires that at each step of the holon hopping , the spinon backflow is fully @xmath90 , only to involve a @xmath45 ( @xmath44 ) spinon being `` transferred '' backward .",
    "otherwise , since the spinon backflow or the phase string effect can not be `` repaired '' , any local fluctuations of the spin polarization of the backflow spinons , no matter how weak they are , will be accumulated to become _ arbitrarily _ large at a sufficiently long path to _ invalidate _ that the hole carries a precise spin quantum number @xmath91 .",
    "in other words , for the spin - charge confinement picture to hold , one must find that @xmath92 , or , @xmath93 the total number of links on any path c , such that the phase string factor @xmath42 becomes _ trivial _ no matter how long the path is . but based on ( [ wf ] ) one can easily rule out such a scenario , which imposes the extreme restriction that the probability for any other choices of @xmath43 vanishes , since an equal probability for both kinds of spinon backflow is explicitly given in the hopping term ( [ ht ] ) .",
    "in fact , an analysis@xcite of the weight functional in the single - electron green s function has already lead to the conclusion that the phase string effect must be _ nontrivial _ ( which actually causes the spectral weight @xmath12 vanish as shown in refs . ) .",
    "therefore , _ the irreparable nontrivial phase string effect directly leads to a true spin - charge separation in the single - hole doped mott antiferromagnet_. it confirms the conjecture made by anderson@xcite .",
    "we note that spin - charge separation has also been discussed in some exact diagonalization approaches for momenta close to ( 0,@xmath94 ) @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will go a step further and discuss some unique features associated with spin - charge separation .",
    "let us define the holon propagator @xmath95 in energy space , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 .",

    ", one can easily prove that @xmath103 for energies @xmath72 .",
    "this means that there are no other sources of phases at low energies to repair the phase string factor @xmath42 .",
    "it should be noted that _ the single - electron _ green s function for the one - hole case has been exactly formulated previously in a very similar fashion @xcite .",
    "there , it was found that each hole path is also modulated by the same phase string @xmath42 .",
    "this result taken in conjunction with ( [ gf0 ] ) , shows that _ the effect of the phase string is entirely in the holon sector _ , while the spinon released from the hole is not directly associated with such phase frustrations .",
    "such a picture is shown in fig .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , as we do not expect the motion of a single hole to affect the ( thermodynamically large ) spin subsystem , except possibly at short time scales or high energies .",
    "= 7.0 cm      thus far , we have discussed the general properties of the phase string effect in a rigorous form . to further study the one - hole problem in a quantitative way",
    ", we need a suitable framework for approximation . as mentioned earlier , the mean field version of the bosonic rvb theory ( sbmft ) provides@xcite a fairly good description of the undoped antiferromagnet .",
    "we now assume , consistent with the discussion so far , that the presence of one hole does not alter the low energy properties of the spin subsystem as the irreparable phase string is to be solely picked up by the hole . in the following",
    "we shall discuss a direct consequence of the phase string effect on the charge part within this approximation : the localization of the holon .    at half - filling ,",
    "sbmft characterized by ( [ ds ] ) is described by the bogoliubov transformation@xcite @xmath104~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is an operator that creates an elementary spinon excitation with a gapless spectrum at @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 , with @xmath110 . within this mean field theory , it is easy to verify that @xmath111 .",
    "if we use this result naively , when there are @xmath112 spins ( and a hole ) , we would conclude ( erroneously ) that @xmath113 , namely , the amplitude of the hopping integral vanishes .",
    "this is incorrect because the hopping term connects two spin subspaces , corresponding to the hole at site @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , which are not necessarily identical in symmetry .",
    "this subtlety has to be incorporated in any calculation , as will be done below .    as a first step ,",
    "let us go back to the case of half filling . here , it is important to recognize that the factor @xmath114 in ( [ bogo ] ) which satisfies @xmath115 and @xmath116 can not be completely determined at the level of mean field theory ; _",
    "i.e. _ , the mean field order parameter @xmath117 is independent of the choice of @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , there is a hidden symmetry in sbmft , which is related to the exact local particle - hole invariance of the system as to be discussed later .",
    "we now exploit this symmetry in sbmft for the case when there is one hole .",
    "fixing the position of the hole , one may define a subspace for the spins , which , at the level of mean field theory , is again described by the bogoliubov transformation ( [ bogo ] ) .",
    "it should be remembered that equation ( [ bogo ] ) now describes an @xmath112 spin subspace . by choosing @xmath119^{k_h}$ ] , where @xmath120",
    "if the hole is on the even sublattice and @xmath121 if the hole is on the odd sublattice site , one has @xmath122 when the hole hops between the sublattices@xcite . then noting that in @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath86 belong to two different spin subspaces , one obtains @xmath125 it is easy to verify that the above choice of @xmath126 optimizes @xmath127 .",
    "thus , we obtain a finite amplitude of the hopping integral for the motion of the holon between two sublattices .",
    "( note that in the summation of ( [ b0 ] ) , @xmath128 has been removed excluding the @xmath26 component . using ( [ b1 ] ) , one can easily see that @xmath26 part has no contribution due to the sign in @xmath22 . )",
    "the mean field result remains approximately the same for the superexchange term @xmath30 in which the holon position is fixed and @xmath129 plays no role .",
    "this hopping amplitude @xmath130 is consistent with @xmath131 , and we may understand this in the following way . physically , each spin subspace has a hidden local particle - hole symmetry , @xmath132 .",
    "it is exact and can be preserved in the rvb description if the no double occupancy constraint is strictly implemented locally .",
    "let us assume that the holon is , say , at an odd sublattice site .",
    "then , on performing a transformation @xmath132 only in the _ corresponding spin subspace _ , it is easy to see that @xmath123 at the hopping bond transforms into the rvb order parameter @xmath133 .",
    "note that at the mean - field level in sbmft , the local hard - core constraint is relaxed where the particle - hole symmetry is no longer exact .",
    "but it can be checked that the symmetry @xmath134 in sbmft still approximately corresponds to @xmath132 at the global level according to ( [ bogo ] ) ( it would be exact if @xmath135 ) .",

    "the very fact that the holon propagator behaves like ( [ g_f ] ) as @xmath137 is enough to invalidate conventional quasiparticle behavior . as in conventional localization problems , we expect @xmath153 to increase with the energy @xmath154 and to represent the true localization length scale at @xmath155 ( @xmath156 is the ground - state energy ) . later , we shall determine the localization length @xmath153 numerically , in the physical regime of @xmath154 .",
    "we find it to be generally larger than the overall scales of sample sizes ( @xmath157 ) used in exact - diagonalization calculations .",
    "so , the hole localization caused by the phase string effect can not be directly detected by exact diagonalization , owing to the limitation of the sample size .",
    "on the contrary , as in conventional localization problems , a localized electron can be mistaken for a delocalized electron simply because the sample sizes are smaller than the localization length .",
    "thus , we argue that the well defined quasiparticle peak seen in finite size calculations is an artifact of small sample sizes and can not persist at scales beyond @xmath158 .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the bosonic spin rvb pairing gives an extremely good description of the undoped antiferromagnet for _ both _ short - range and long - range spin - spin correlations .",
    "the direct hopping of the holon originates from _ short - range _ rvb pairing with a local particle - hole symmetry . unlike the long - range spin correlations ,",
    "the short - range correlations are not sensitive to doping and the local rvb order parameter @xmath159 provides a certain local `` rigidity '' that underpins the doped antiferromagnet , as long as the the average spacing between the holes is larger than the distance between nearest neighbors .",
    "indeed , such a direct hopping term can persist into the metallic ( superconducting ) phase at finite doping , as discussed in ref . .",
    "however , unlike the metallic system , the one - hole case is different as we do not expect the af spin background to change at thermodynamic scales .",

    "a similar asymmetric structure in one - dimension has been found in ref ..",

    "@xmath216 along ( 0,0 ) to ( 0 , @xmath94 ) is indicated in the figure by the small bars . in fig .",
    "7 , the spinon spectrum @xmath216 fits the observed arpes `` quasiparticle '' spectrum data reasonably well over the whole brillouin zone along @xmath201 ( @xmath220 ) to ( 0,0 ) ( @xmath80 ) and ( 0,@xmath94 ) ( @xmath221 ) ( which are symmetric in our theory ) with @xmath204@xmath203 .",
    "note that the low - energy scale is determined by @xmath4 instead of @xmath222 and the features shown in fig .",
    "6 are not sensitive to @xmath222 .",
    "thus , second - or further neighbor hopping terms are not expected to play as important a role as they do in determining the energy bottom , @xmath5 , shown in fig .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the reason that the low energy peak or edge of the spectral function is correlated with the spinon spectrum can be easily understood by noting the fact that @xmath223 becomes the sharpest near the bottom @xmath198 with @xmath224 which contributes to @xmath212 in ( [ ae ] ) at @xmath225 and @xmath226 . in fig .",

    "the evolution from a peak to an edge as @xmath6 moves away from @xmath201 is because the spectral function of the holon is quickly broadened away from the band bottom in the presence of the random flux .",
    "note that compared to the experiment the peak structure in fig .",
    "8(a ) is a bit too sharp which implies that the actual strength of @xmath227 should be closer to our estimation used in fig .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the line shape of the spectral function shown in fig . 6 and",
    "8(a ) looks strikingly similar to the arpes measurements in sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 and ca@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it reflects essentially the _ convolution _ law of spinon and holon , i.e. , the spin - charge separation .",
    "but we would like to point out that the simple convolution law is not enough . here",
    "the _ coherence _ of the spinon in contrast to the _ incoherent _ holon is key to the characteristic features of the line shape and the `` dispersion '' of the peak or edge structure . to illustrate this point",
    ", we replace the coherent factor @xmath230 in ( [ ae ] ) by a constant ( i.e. , @xmath231 ) , and re - calculate the spectral function which is plotted in fig .",
    "8(b ) along ( 0,0 )  @xmath201 .",
    "one sees that the whole low - energy peak - edge feature in the left panel of fig . 6 and fig .",
    "8(a ) totally disappears in fig .",
    "8(b ) . in this case",
    ", the summation in ( [ ae ] ) smears out the peak structure and @xmath212 is more or less like the density of states for the holon .",
    "so the coherent factor @xmath232 in the spinon propagator is crucial for the `` quasiparticle '' peak to emerge in the spin - charge separation formulation of the spectral function , which is the unique result of the _ bosonic _ rvb description of spins .",
    "this explains why the correct line shape has not been directly obtained in the slave - boson formalism , even though the prediction that the `` quasiparticle '' spectrum obtained in arpes actually corresponds to the spinon spectrum was first made@xcite there .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the incoherence of the holon is also an important factor as discussed above .",
    "it is well - known that a particle must be generally localized , at least in the low - energy regime , in the presence of the random flux governed by @xmath207 in ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "we have checked the localization lengths corresponding to the case of fig .",
    "6 using standard methods@xcite .",
    "the localization length quickly jumps from @xmath233-@xmath234 ( in lattice units ) to @xmath235 near the holon band edge which covers an energy range related to the low - energy peaks of the spectral function in fig .",
    "6 . as noted before , the localization length scale of the holon is generally much larger than the maximum sample sizes ( @xmath236 ) in numerical exact - diagonalization calculations@xcite .",
    "thus , numerical calculations providing a `` metallic '' quasiparticle picture should be irrelevant to the true picture at large length scales .    finally , to conclude our discussion of arpes in the mott insulator , we turn to the experimental results of ronning _ at al .",
    "these authors identify a `` remnant fermi surface '' in the insulator from arpes measurements : they define the so - called relative momentum distribution @xmath237 with the cutoff energy @xmath238@xmath203 , then identify `` @xmath239 '' by locating the position where @xmath240 drops suddenly . then",
    "a `` remnant fermi surface '' is found as the contour of steepest descent of @xmath240 .",
    "such a `` remnant fermi surface '' roughly coincides with the large fermi surface expected for a free electron gas at half - filling concentration .",
    "it should be emphasized that this contour is _ not _ an equal energy contour . in fact , the peak ( or edge ) of the spectral function disperses at momenta along the `` remnant fermi surface '' as much as that shown in fig .",
    "so the `` remnant fermi surface '' mainly indicates a strong momentum dependence of the energy - integrated spectral function , @xmath240 .",
    "we believe this is due to the effect of the mobile hole on the spin background ( at very short time scales ) .",
    "so far we have not considered the influence of the phase string effect on the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this is based on the fact that a single hole does not affect the spin background at the thermodynamic scale . however , the af background _ surrounding",
    "_ the doped hole should be still strongly distorted by the hopping at @xmath241 , which in turn will feed back on the hole itself through the phase string effect .",
    "obviously , this happens at short length and time - scales .",
    "consequently , one has to go beyond the effective hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) as well as the random flux treatment of the phase string effect .",
    "not being within the main purview of this paper , we relegate the discussion of such effects to the appendix .",
    "although antiferromagnetism in the mott insulator has been well understood based on the bosonic rvb description , the problem of a single hole doped into such a system is found to be nontrivial .",
    "unlike the spin - polaron picture in which the hole is predicted to behave like a landau - fermi quasiparticle carrying a finite - size spin distortion around it , the real picture for the motion of the doped hole is that it always picks up a string of signs from the spin background during its hopping , known as the phase string , which leads to the destruction of the `` coherence '' of the doped hole as a landau - fermi quasiparticle .",
    "the phase string characterizes the effect of spin backflow during the motion of the hole .",
    "the irreparable nature of phase string is intimately related to spin - charge separation : the hole can not carry a precise spin-1/2 quantum number with it .",
    "in contrast , if the holon and spinon were tightly confined together , the phase string effect would become trivial ( reparable ) , as is the case when one naively uses the @xmath46-operator to replace the spinon - holon decomposition in ( [ ht ] ) .",
    "hence , the demonstration that the phase string effect can not be `` healed '' through spin superexchange interaction at low energies , presented in sec .",
    "iib and refs . , points directly to spin - charge separation .",
    "it is also found that the spin backflow , or equivalently , the phase string leads to mutual statistics between the hole and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "that the backflow of spin current could lead to mutual statistics and spin - charge separation was also anticipated by baskaran @xcite .    in the one - hole case , the phase string effect mainly acts on the holon part , causing its localization .",
    "but the spinon remains coherent in the bosonic rvb background .",
    "consequently , during its propagation , a bare hole releases the coherent spinon constituent whose isotropic dispersion essentially determines the position of the low - energy peak or edge of the spectral function . on the other hand ,",
    "spin - charge separation characterized by the convolution law of the holon and spinon propagators is responsible for the intrinsic broad feature of the spectral function at higher energy . in the phase string formalism",
    ", the singular part of the phase string effect also decides the fermi points @xmath201 in the low - energy , long - time limit as well as the large `` remnant fermi surface '' structure in the high - energy , equal - time limit .",
    "we thus obtain a systematic and natural explanation for the arpes measurements within the framework of the @xmath0 model .",
    "conversely , one may say that the arpes experiments have clearly presented evidence for spin - charge separation , as emphasized by anderson .",
    "we find that the `` coherence '' of the spinon , reflected by the factor @xmath230 in sbmft , plays an important role in determining the arpes line shapes .",
    "a naive convolution without this factor is not enough to explain the line shape observed by arpes .",
    "we also note that the strong temperature dependence of the arpes line shapes over a wide energy range @xcite , may be easily understood based on the temperature dependence of @xmath230 .",
    "details will be presented elsewhere .",
    "finally , we point out that the temperature dependence of @xmath230 is also crucial to get the correct behavior of the relaxation rate ( @xmath242 ) in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements , spin - spin correlation length , and other magnetic properties at half - filling within the sbmft .",
    "the prediction that the holon as the charge carrier is localized by the phase string effect is also consistent with the cuprate superconductors .",
    "it is known that the phase with aflro ( weakly doped regime ) is always an insulator . according to our theory , the localization is due to the intrinsic nature of the doped mott insulator instead of external reasons like the anderson localization in the presence of impurities .",
    "note that the localization of the hole is because the phase string is solely picked up by the hole , and the antiferromagnetic background remains the same as at half - filling , thermodynamically . at finite density of holes , both spin and charge degrees of freedom will be affected by the phase string , which can lead to a metallic ( superconducting ) phase@xcite without aflro .",
    "we emphasize that the irreparable phase string effect always exists , even in the metallic phase .",
    "this is because the phase string reflects the competition between the hopping and superexchange interactions in the @xmath0 model , which has nothing to do with the existence of aflro .",
    "thus , the phase string effect will persist at any finite doping so long as short range antiferromagnetic correlations persist@xcite .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with a.  ferraz , t.  tohyama , t.  k.  lee , and especially c.  kim and f.  ronning who kindly provided their experimental data .",

    "the holon is localized by phase string in space .",
    "but at a short scale within the localization length , the holon may behave like in the metallic phase at finite doping where holons are mobile .",
    "it has been found@xcite that in the metallic phase the phase string effect will influence both the spin and charge degrees of freedom in such a way that the correct decomposition form for the electron becomes @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are the `` true '' holon and spinon operators and the phase shift field @xmath246 precisely keeps track of the non - repairable phase string effect . in the following",

    "this is because @xmath260 using the non - double - occupancy constraint in which no propagation of the holon at a finite distance can occur at strictly equal time on the half - filling ground state . on the other hand , @xmath240",
    "for a finite cutoff @xmath253 will involve a finite - time holon propagation over some finite distance . in this case , the phase string factor in ( [ equalt1 ] ) will show up to determine the basic feature while the rest of the propagator involving holon and spinon will mainly give rise to a broadening in the momentum space depending on how far the holon and spinon constituents can travel under the cutoff @xmath253 . at @xmath261 , the momentum broadening would reach infinity ( as only @xmath262 contributes ) such that any momentum structure arising from @xmath263 gets smeared out .",
    "but at a large but finite @xmath264 the momentum structure due to the phase string factor should show up . here as an approximation the equal - time phase string factor",
    "is still used so long as @xmath264 is sufficiently large .    in the spin channel , a line - integral expression similar to ( [ equalt1 ] ) also appears@xcite in the spin - spin correlation function , leading to the so - called incommensurate antiferromagnetic peaks . here",
    "we can borrow the similar method used in ref . to manipulate the contribution of the phase string factor ( [ equalt1 ] ) in @xmath240 , which gives rise to four `` incommensurate peaks '' at ( @xmath265 , 0 ) and ( 0 , @xmath265 ) in momentum space with @xmath266@xcite .",
    "if this oscillating factor solely decides the momentum structure of @xmath240 with the rest term in the propagator mainly contributing a broadening as discussed above , then one gets a contour plot of @xmath240 in fig . 9 in terms of the superposition of aforementioned four peaks ( with @xmath267 ) at an arbitrary broadening ( which is presumably controlled by the energy cutoff @xmath253 : when",
