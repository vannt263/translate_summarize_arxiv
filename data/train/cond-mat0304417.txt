    "bilayer quantum hall systems at total filling factor @xmath0 exhibit one of the most interesting many - body correlation effects : spontaneous interlayer phase coherence , which is solely caused by the coulomb interaction in the limit of zero interlayer tunneling .",
    "recently this phenomenon has received drastic experimental support by spielman _",
    "@xcite , who discovered a strong enhancement in the zero - bias interlayer tunneling conductance for interlayer distance @xmath1 in the regime of very little tunneling , where @xmath2 is the magnetic length .",
    "these experiments strongly indicated a presence of spontaneous interlayer coherence at small interlayer distances .",
    "the ground state in the limit of zero interlayer distance can be shown to be spontaneously interlayer phase coherent due to layer symmetry .",
    "one of the most convenient way to see this is to use the pseudospin representation in which the top ( bottom ) layer is denoted as pseudospin @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . in the limit of zero interlayer separation ,",
    "there is exact pseudospin su(2 ) symmetry so that our bilayer system at @xmath5 with pseudospin can be exactly mapped onto a single layer system @xmath6 with real spin .",
    "then , it is straightforward to see that the ground state should be a pseudospin ferromagnet in order to reduce the coulomb energy cost , i.e. hund s rule . on the other hand",
    ", it has been known that , in the limit of large interlayer separation , the ground state is composed of two split composite fermion fermi seas @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is clear that there should be a quantum phase transition at a critical interlayer distance @xmath7 since the ground states at small and large interlayer separations are not adiabatically connected .",
    "however , it is not at all clear what happens near @xmath7 . in spite of intense theoretical efforts in the past",
    ", the true nature of phase transition near @xmath7 has been elusive .",
    "analytical approaches based on hatree - fock theories @xcite were not able to reliably treat strong quantum fluctuations near the phase transition , which led to the erroneous prediction of broken translational symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , analytic approaches utilizing effective field theories @xcite were not directly based on the microscopic hamiltonian of the many - body coulomb interaction .",
    "so its validity should be justified by other means such as exact diagonalization . in particular ,",
    "mapping of the original many - body coulomb hamiltonian to a spin model hamiltonian is not expected to be valid near the critical interlayer separation .",
    "previous numerical studies based on exact diagonalization @xcite , however , did not take into account fundamental fluctuations of interlayer number difference due to intrinsic , quantum - mechanical uncertainty in layer indices .",
    "consequently those studies could not provide any direct information related to spontaneous interlayer phase coherence .",
    "it is crucial at this point to distinguish between pseudospin ferromagnetic order and interlayer phase coherence .",
    "there is no fundamental reason to believe that they are identical because the interlayer phase coherence is a necessary condition , but not a sufficient condition for pseudospin ferromagnetism .",
    "we will show in this article that , at intermediate interlayer distances , there is another sort of long - range interlayer phase coherence due to pseudospin spiral ordering .",
    "it should be emphasized that this pseudospin spiral order is spontaneous in that it exists solely because of the coulomb interaction without any external parallel magnetic field .",
    "the formation of pseudospin spiral order has been considered previously in the presence of parallel magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we will begin by defining the hamiltonian of bilayer quantum hall systems in sec .",
    "[ sec_hamil ] .",
    "the pseudospin magnetization is computed as a function of interlayer distance @xmath8 in the limit of zero interlayer tunneling in sec .",
    "[ sec_sx ] where the intrinsic , quantum - mechanical fluctuation of interlayer number difference is fully taken into account , based on the analogy with superconductivity . defined as the point where the pseudospin ferromagnetic order is destroyed , the critical interlayer distance @xmath7 is reliably determined . in sec .",
    "[ sec_spiral ] we focus on the nature of the instability which destroys pseudospin ferromagnetic order at @xmath7 .",
    "we will show that the instability is due to the formation of pseudospin spiral order which is manifested in the lowest energy excitations . by computing a new order parameter for pseudospin spiral",
    ", we will show in sec .",
    "[ op ] that the ground state itself has the pseudospin spiral order .",
    "finally , it is argued in section [ conclusions ] that a signature of the phase transition from pseudospin ferromagnetic order to our predicted pseudospin spiral order may have been already observed experimentally .",
    "let us begin by writing the hamiltonian for the bilayer quantum hall systems : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lowest landau level ( lll ) projection operator .",
    "@xmath11 represents the usual coulomb interaction between electrons : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnetic length , @xmath8 is the interlayer distance , and @xmath14 is the lateral separation between the _ i_-th and _ j_-th electrons . in the above",
    "we have used a pseudospin representation to distinguish the top ( @xmath3 ) and the bottom ( @xmath4 ) layers . in general",
    ", we define the pseudospin operator as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the usual pauli matrix , and @xmath17 denotes the lll orbital index .",
    "note that @xmath18 is half the electron number difference between the two layers , and @xmath19 is associated with interlayer tunneling .",
    "we take the real spin to be fully polarized .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath20 in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) can be written as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the single particle interlayer tunneling gap .",
    "although eq.([h_t ] ) is valid for general @xmath22 , we are interested only in the limit of zero interlayer tunneling , i.e. @xmath23 , which is appropriate when considering spontaneous interlayer coherence ( note that the @xmath24 limit is not the same as the @xmath25 situation ) .",
    "we analyze the hamiltonian in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) by using exact diagonalization ( via a modified lanczos method ) in the torus geometry @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the beginning , it will be shown that there is a new long - range interlayer phase coherence due to pseudospin spiral order at sufficiently large @xmath8 .",
    "but , first , we should determine the critical interlayer distance , @xmath7 , at which pseudospin ferromagnetic order terminates . of course , the most natural order parameter for the pseudospin ferromagnetic order is the pseudospin magnetization in the @xmath26-direction : @xmath27 .",
    "it is tempting to apply exact diagonalization techniques to finite systems with fixed number of electrons in each layer .",
    "but , @xmath19 changes the interlayer number difference by unity ( @xmath28 ) so that the ground state expectation value is precisely zero when computed naively without any explicit interlayer tunneling .",
    "this problem has been addressed in an _ ad hoc _ manner by introducing explicit interlayer tunneling @xcite , which , however , severely obscures the effect of spontaneous phase coherence and may produce misleading results .",
    "the real solution is to realize that there is intrinsic , quantum - mechanical uncertainty in the layer index of electrons at small interlayer distance ( even in the limit of zero tunneling ) so that the true ground state @xmath29 is a linear combination of various states with different @xmath18 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the lowest energy state with @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a sharply peaked function of @xmath34 with width @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the number of electrons .",
    "it is important to remember that even the halperin ( 1,1,1 ) state , @xmath37 , has @xmath38 , which can be proved by analyzing the following , explicit wavefunction including both the orbital and pseudospin part @xcite : @xmath39 |0\\rangle .",
    "\\label{111}\\ ] ]    @xmath37 is the exact ground state at @xmath40 .",
    "because it can be exactly mapped onto the bcs wavefunction , it is fruitful to consider an analogy with the bcs theory for general @xmath8 . following the bcs theory",
    ", one can compute the pseudospin magnetization @xmath19 as follows : @xmath41 where the last two step are justified in the thermodynamic limit since @xmath33 is sharply peaked at @xmath42 .",
    "although @xmath27 should be exactly @xmath43 at @xmath40 in the thermodynamic limit due to the exact pseudospin su(2 ) symmety , there are some finite - system size corrections .",
    "after some algebra on the ( 1,1,1 ) state , eq.([bcs ] ) shows that @xmath44 is @xmath45 for n odd ( @xmath46 ) , and is @xmath47 for n even ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "therefore , the pseudospin magnetization should be scaled as @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) for @xmath36 odd ( even ) .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the pseudospin magnetization per particle ( defined in eq.([bcs ] ) ) as a function of @xmath51 for various numbers of electrons .",
    "as conventional in finite system analysis , the critical interlayer distance can be obtained from the inflection point of @xmath27 : @xmath52 .",
    "although @xmath7 was estimated to be around @xmath53 previously in various approaches , it should be emphasized that the pseudospin magnetization @xmath27 is computed for the first time in this article without any interlayer tunneling . and therefore @xmath7 is reliably determined without any ambiguity .    ) as a function of interlayer distance @xmath51 for various numbers of electrons @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig1],width=220 ]",
    "we now address the nature of instability causing the destruction of pseudospin ferromagnetic order .",
    "this question is , in turn , directly related to the nature of the new ground state at @xmath54 . to be specific",
    ", we consider the lowest energy excitations which are responsible for the ground state instability .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the dispersion curves of the lowest energy excitations at @xmath55 and @xmath56 for a finite system with the total number of electrons @xmath57 and the number of pseudospin - up electrons @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) .",
    "there are several points to be emphasized .",
    "first , there is clearly a linearly dispersing goldstone mode at small interlayer distances , such as @xmath55 .",
    "however , @xmath60regarding the discreteness of finite - system wavevectors , the goldstone mode seems to vanish for @xmath61 , which coincides with the destruction of pseudospin ferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "consistent with the conclusion from @xmath27 , this shows that the ground state undergoes a phase transition around @xmath62 .",
    "second , contrary to the prediction of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) theory @xcite , there is no softening of the dispersion curve ( roton ) at any finite momentum for any interlayer distance .",
    "remember that the rpa theory predicts a roton around @xmath63 , which was believed to cause an instability toward charge density wave order .",
    "this already shows that previous theories have some serious flaws in describing the phase transition at @xmath62 .",
    "we will show in the next paragraph that there are completely different low - energy excitations at large @xmath51 .",
    "third , several previous numerical studies @xcite were unfortunately based on the exact diagonalization of @xmath64 system , which , under careful investigation @xcite , can be shown to predict a wigner crystal at large @xmath8 rather than a quantum hall liquid , which is a finite - system artifact of boundary condition and special number of electrons .",
    "fourth , these lowest - excitation energies are exactly zero in the @xmath65 limit where there is no interaction between electrons with different pseudospins .     and @xmath56 for a finite system with the total number of electrons @xmath57 and the number of pseudospin - up electrons @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) .",
    "it will be shown that the lowest energy state in the momentum channel @xmath66 ( denoted by arrows ) is the pseudospin spiral state .",
    "[ fig2],width=240 ]    however , the most crucial aspect of the dispersion curve is that there are completely new low - energy excitations due to the pseudospin spiral order , which are denoted by arrows in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the lowest energy state in the momentum channel @xmath66 ( denoted by arrows in fig.[fig2 ] ) begins to be ripped out of the well - defined dispersion curve at @xmath67 , and it becomes completely separated from all the other excitations at @xmath68 so that it becomes really the lowest energy excitation among all momentum channels .",
    "the same behavior is found in all studied systems with different values of @xmath36 and @xmath69 , with exception of the @xmath64 system due to a finite - size artifact as mentioned in the above .",
    "note that there are three other degenerate excitations in the momentum channels @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 due to reflection symmetries and periodic boundary conditions of torus geometry .",
    "these peculiar excitations are completely different from usual rotons because ( i ) they form isolated points rather than a part of conventional dispersion curve , and ( ii ) their momentum increases as @xmath73 , which diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we will show later that these peculiar properties are precisely the properties of pseudospin spiral state .    in order to understand why these excitations are the pseudospin spiral states",
    ", it would be best if we first examine the following pseudospin spiral wavefunction : @xmath74 |0\\rangle   \\label{spiral}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the linear momentum in the landau gauge , i.e. , @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the linear system size ( note that @xmath77 at @xmath0 ) .",
    "we will show later in fig.[fig3 ] by explicitly computing the overlap between @xmath78 and the lowest - energy excitations ( denoted by arrows in fig.[fig2 ] ) that the lowest - energy excitations are the pseudospin spiral states .",
    "but , first , we would like to emphasize that the pseudospin spiral state @xmath79 is the exact ground state in the presence of parallel magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a surprising result of this article is that , even without parallel magnetic field , spiral states are the lowest energy excitations which cause the instability of pseudospin ferromagnetic order .    .",
    "[ fig3],width=220 ]    to elucidate the physical meaning of pseudospin spiral state , examine eq.([spiral ] ) which reveals that @xmath80 contains diagonal interlayer correlations between the states with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "remember that the interlayer correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath84 is identical to the diagonal interlayer correlation between electrons with different pseudospins which are separated laterally in the @xmath85-direction by @xmath86 . in turn , this diagonal interlayer correlation is physically equivalent to the pseudospin spiral order with spiraling period of @xmath87 because the pseudospin part of wavefunction is essentially given by @xmath88 pseudospin spiral excitations ( and therefore the diagonal interlayer correlation ) are schematically depicted in fig.[fig4 ] .    , where the ground state is conjectured to be a bound state of two pseudospin spiral states with opposite winding direction , i.e. a bound state of ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "[ fig4],width=249 ]    now we compute the momentum of pseudospin spiral states by directly applying the magnetic translation operator onto @xmath89 .",
    "the explicit algebra shows that the momentum of @xmath90 is @xmath91 which is exactly the momentum of the lowest - energy excitation seen in fig.[fig2 ] if @xmath92 .",
    "note that the momentum of this pseudospin spiral state is actually proportional to its spiraling period .",
    "that is the reason why the momentum of pseudospin spiral state with long spiraling period diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "similarly , we can explain why the pseudospin spiral state occurs in an isolated momentum channel .",
    "consider two pseudospin spiral states with long period , say @xmath92 and @xmath93 , whose momenta differ by a factor proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the pseudospin spiral states with two different long spiraling periods do not occur in adjacent momenta .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath78 is the pseudospin spiral excitation in the limit of long spiraling period ( @xmath95 ) , which initiates the destruction of pseudospin ferromagnetic order .",
    "therefore , it may be indicative of a second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , fig.[fig3 ] shows the overlap between the pseudospin spiral state @xmath78 in eq.([spiral ] ) and the lowest - energy excited state with @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "as one can see , the overlap is high overall at small @xmath51 , and is very close to unity ( @xmath97 ) especially around @xmath98 which coincides with the point where @xmath27 begins to deviate from the fully saturated value of @xmath99 .",
    "this shows that the instability of pseudospin ferromagnetic order is indeed caused by pseudospin spiral order .",
    "it should be noted that , though the overlap is lowered at larger @xmath51 , the low energy excitation is in general adiabatically connected to the pseudospin spiral state . in fact , the reason for lower overlaps at larger @xmath51 is that our trial wavefunction in eq.([spiral ] ) is not very accurate anymore for larger @xmath51 since it is based on the assumption that the ground state is the ( 1,1,1 ) state .",
    "of course , the ground state itself is affected by the pseudospin spiral instability which , after all , destroys the pseudospin ferromagnetic order at the critical interlayer distance .",
    "therefore , it would be satisfactory if , in addition to the evidence due to the low energy excitation , one can prove directly that the ground state has the pseudospin spiral order at @xmath100 .",
    "the next section will be devoted to the pseudospin spiral order in the ground state .     with @xmath92 ) measuring the diagonal interlayer correlation .",
    "note that the diagonal interlayer correlation is physically equivalent to the pseudospin spiral order .",
    "[ fig5],width=249 ]",
    "it is conjectured that the ground state at large @xmath8 is in fact a bound state of two pseudospin spiral states with opposite winding direction , i.e. a bound state of ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.[fig4 ] , which requires a complicated interaction between the two spiral states ( note that this conjecture is consistent with the fact that the ground state itself does not break translational symmetry ) .",
    "so instead of constructing a trial wavefunction we take a more transparent approach by defining a new order parameter which measures the pseudospin spiral order ( or equivalently the diagonal interlayer correlation ) : @xmath101    the following properties of @xmath102 are worth mentioning .",
    "( i ) @xmath102 is a generalization of pseudospin magnetization @xmath19 which measures the vertical interlayer correlation : @xmath103 .",
    "so the relationship between @xmath102 and @xmath90 is analogous to that between @xmath19 and @xmath37 .",
    "\\(ii ) when acting upon momentum eigenstates , @xmath102 alters momentum of the eigenstates , though changes in momentum are negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "so , in order to avoid any confusion , we compute @xmath104 instead .",
    "\\(iii ) in order to be meaningful in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath104 should be scaled as @xmath105 .",
    "\\(iv ) since the ( 1,1,1 ) state does not have any pseudospin spiral order , @xmath106 should be zero in the thermodynamic limit . however , there are some finite - system size corrections : @xmath107 .",
    "we subtract these finite system size corrections from the expectation value of @xmath108 .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] plots the ground state expectation value of @xmath109 as a function of interlayer distance @xmath51 .",
    "as one can see , @xmath110 is peaked around @xmath111 which is consistent with the critical interlayer distance @xmath7 .",
    "so it is shown that indeed the ground state contains the pseudospin spiral order at @xmath100 .",
    "in fact , fig.[fig5 ] implies that the pseudospin ferromagnetic order and the pseudospin spiral order may coexist for a range of @xmath8 since the expectation value of pseudospin spiral order parameter is not zero even in interlayer distances smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "of course , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath110 will be zero at @xmath112 since there is no interlayer correlation in the two split fermi seas of composite fermions .    finally , we would like to discuss the physical origin of pseudospin spiral order .",
    "first , let us remind ourselves that the pseudospin ferromagnetic state can be viewed as a condensate of neutral pairs of electrons and correlation holes which are bound directly across the interlayer separation .",
    "now for sufficiently large @xmath8 the ground state has the pseudospin spiral order , or equivalently diagonal interlayer correlation , which can be also viewed as a condensate of neutral electron - hole pairs with extended size and higher symmetry such as @xmath113-wave , as compared to the @xmath114-wave - like pair in pseudospin ferromagnet .",
    "now , the origin of spiral order can be identified with the origin of extended pairs which is due to weak pairing .",
    "of course , the pairing between electrons and correlation holes is weakened as d increases .",
    "eventually the binding is completely lost when the split composite fermion fermi seas are formed .",
    "we conclude by mentioning some experimental implications . recently ,",
    "kellogg _ et al . _ observed an enhanced longitudinal drag resistance at @xmath51 as large as @xmath115 where the enhanced tunneling conductance is absent @xcite .",
    "theoretically , tunneling is renormalized from the bare single particle tunneling gap @xmath22 to the greatly enhanced renormalized tunneling @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that the enhanced tunneling conductance becomes absent as soon as the pseudospin ferromagnetic order is destroyed at @xmath62 . on the other hand , we have shown that there is a new interlayer phase coherence due to the pseudospin spiral order for @xmath117 which , we speculate , causes the longitudinal drag anomaly because of remaining interlayer correlation . regarding the hall resistance ,",
    "our pseudospin spiral state is expected to be incompressible , as shown in the dispersion curve .",
    "however , the lowest energy gap is estimated to be very small so that the hall plateau will be difficult to be observed in current temperature ranges and impurity concentrations .",
    "the author is very grateful to s. das sarma for his careful reading of manuscript and his constant support throughout this work .",
    "the author is also indebted to e. demler , s. m. girvin , a. kaminski and v. w. scarola for their insightful comments .",
    "this work was supported by arda .                              as shown later",
    ", the ground state at large @xmath8 acquires a pseudospin spiral order which is associated with diagonal interlayer correlation . since this diagonal interlayer correlation creates a _ nonlocal _ correlation between laterally separated electrons ( in top layer ) and correlation holes ( in bottom layer ) for sufficiently large @xmath8 , it is no longer valid to map the original long - range coulomb hamiltonian to a usual spin model which is based on the existence of _ local _ spin operator",
    ". therefore , there is no fundamental reason for the goldstone mode at sufficiently large @xmath8 .",
    "we have proved that for @xmath64 the energy dispersion in the first brillouin zone has a pattern associated with rectangular - lattice wigner crystal which is commensurate with rectangular unit cell .",
    "also , this pattern persists even in the @xmath65 limit .    in terms of the viewpoint that the interlayer coherent state is a macroscopic condensate of neutral electron - hole pairs ,",
    "the pseusospin spiral instability with long spiral period can be interpreted as a gradual change in the nature of neutral pairs from tightly bound @xmath114-wave - like pairing to a pairing with extended size and higher symmetry . and",
    "this continuous change in the nature of pairing may indicate a second order phase transition which is consistent with the viewpoint from the pseusospin spiral instability with long spiral period .",
    "note that in order to compute the overlap one should project @xmath80 into the hilbert space of fixed @xmath18 since @xmath80 is a linear combination of various @xmath18 eigenstates similar to the ( 1,1,1 ) state ."
