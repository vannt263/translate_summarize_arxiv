    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) in cuprates was originally motivated by the search for superconductors with strong electron - phonon coupling@xcite .",
    "the first hts compounds , la@xmath0ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lbco ) and lsco , do indeed display a very large isotopic effect for oxygen , although the doping dependence of this effect turns out to be very anomalous@xcite .",
    "later studies pointed out that electron - phonon coupling may not be the main origin of the cooper pairing@xcite , in particular for optimal doping .",
    "but its role across the phase diagram of cuprates is still controversial , in particular in its under - doped region .",
    "an important point is that single electron band approximations , such as density functional theory ( dft ) find a small electron - phonon coupling @xcite , but they possibly miss many body effects , as it was suggested that large couplings may exist in the presence of strong electron - electron correlations @xcite .",
    "an important point stressed in dft based investigations on electron - phonon coupling in cuprates is that these calculations seem to reproduce well the marked softening with a cosine dispersion , that develops under doping for longitudinal cu - o bond - stretching mode along the direction ( @xmath5 0 0 ) of such bonds ( modes with @xmath6 character ) . at the same time , large discrepancies between those calculations for the same mode , but along the diagonal direction ( @xmath5 @xmath5 0 ) ( modes with @xmath7 character ) are found@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the physical origin of the anomaly in the dispersion of the cu - o bond - stretching modes is different for the two directions @xcite .",
    "underdoped cuprates exhibit a static , or quasi - static , modulation of the charge , characterized by a stripe pattern parallel to the cu - o bonds , which can give clear diffraction peaks both in the charge @xcite and spin channel , for doping close to @xmath8 with a propagation vector of @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ a periodicity of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the lattice parameter along the cu - o bonds .",
    "besides the above mentioned cu - o bond stretching anomaly with cosine shape , an additional marked dip and a sizable broadening of the line - shape is observed for the same phonon branch , close to the wave stripe vector @xmath12 @xcite ; it has been established that such feature can not be simulated by dft @xcite .",
    "large electron - phonon coupling can drive both phonon softening and broadening as it as been established , for example , in the case of classical superconductors such as , _",

    "their layered structure is similar to the cuprate one , characterized by cuo@xmath1 plane , but without oxygen in the blocks separating these planes ( see fig .",
    "[ ccoc structure ] , left panel ) .",
    "these compounds represent an ideal test bench for the physics governing the high tc superconductivity that is commonly believed to depend only on the cuo@xmath1 planes , independently from the details of the oxide blocks between them . in particular , oxychlorides have a chlorine ion that replaces the apical oxygen .",
    "the apical oxygen is important for the dynamics of the anionic octahedra surrounding the copper cation on most of the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "moreover , oxychlorides are ideal for studying phonon dispersions , particularly the one of the copper - oxygen bond stretching mode by means of ixs spectroscopy , because they are composed only of low z , thus yielding a higher ixs signal , due to the weaker photoelectric absorption compared to the cuprates , and also thanks to their simple 1-layer structure with small disorder , which reduces the number of modes to be measured and calculated .",
    "we note that these characteristics should also facilitate _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "underdoped oxychlorides show a modulation in the charge density , as their cuprate counterpart .",

    "in addition to this effect , by comparing our results on the longitudinal cu - o bond - stretching mode in superconducting ca@xmath0cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 to our model , we found that screening effect may lead to a simultaneous bending down of the whole dispersion along both the ( @xmath5 0 0 ) and ( @xmath5 @xmath5 0 ) directions .",

    "this suggests that overestimated screening effects can lead to simulations that reproduce the dispersion at much higher doping .",
    "if compared to optimal or slightly under - doped compounds , this gives a dispersion which is accidentally similar to the one for the mode with @xmath6 character , while giving a large difference between calculation and experimental dispersion for the mode with @xmath7 character , and accordingly underestimate the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "indeed , the dispersion found in ref . for the cu - o bond - stretching modes with @xmath6 and @xmath7 character",
    "are strikingly similar to the experimental dispersion found only in highly overdoped cuprates la@xmath0m@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( m = sr , ba)@xcite . therefore , a possible unique origin for the softening of modes with both @xmath6 and @xmath7 character in dft calculation can not be ruled out .",
    "this would imply that the phonon simulations by dft correspond to a much higher doping , that , because of the larger screening , have a lower electron - phonon coupling . to confirm such conclusion also in oxychlorides",
    ", it would be important to compare with dft calculations , and to have data on the un - doped parent compound .",
    "we presented an extended study of the phonon dispersion in superconducting ca@xmath0cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 , doped with ca vacancies , close to optimal doping . we interpret the results using lattice dynamical calculations based on a shell model , and we compare them to what obtained for other hole - doped cuprates , in particular with the t - structure .",
    "we found an overall agreement between our model and the data , confirming the good choice of parameters of the common interatomic potential for the lattice dynamics of cuprates first proposed in ref . .",
    "an anomalous dip in the cu - o bond stretching dispersion develops also in oxychlorides with a simultaneous marked broadening of the mode .",
    "the broadening maximum appears at @xmath4 that corresponds to the charge - modulations propagation vector , observed by means of stm experiments @xcite .",
    "our data thus unveil a dynamic precursor state of the above modulations . by comparing our measurements on the longitudinal cu - o bond - stretching mode in superconducting ca@xmath0cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 with our model , we found that screening effect may bend downwards simultaneously the dispersions along both the ( @xmath5 0 0 ) and ( @xmath5 @xmath5 0 ) directions , a result that can help explaining the discrepancies between phonon dispersion based on dft calculations@xcite and the experimental data in cuprates .",
