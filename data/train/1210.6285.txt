    "the formation processes of massive stars in galaxies are one of the key topics of study in modern astronomy as these massive stars play an essential role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "because stars are formed from molecular gas , studies on molecular gas in galaxies can provide us with crucial information on the fundamental physical processes of massive star formation .",
    "most of the molecular gas is confined to molecular clouds , and virtually all giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are sites of star formation in the milky way .",
    "thus , the physical properties of the gases present in gmcs serve as important information for the investigation of massive star formation .    in order to investigate the evolution of gmcs ,",
    "it is important to study gmcs using a statistical approach . for this purpose ,",
    "observations of nearby galaxies in the local group are preferable , because we can easily construct a gmc sample at an uniform distance from us whereas gmcs in the milky way are often subject to the distance determination issues .",
    "in fact , a wide - area @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) survey of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) provides us with rich information about the variation in gmc properties @xcite with the evolution of the associated star clusters @xcite .",
    "the disk galaxy m33 is another important target for such study because while the lmc is an irregular dwarf galaxy , m33 is one of the nearest galaxies ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) with a spiral morphology .",
    "in addition , its favorable inclination angle ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) enables us to observe the disk face , thereby making this galaxy unique .",
    "because of these merits , gmcs in m33 have been statistically investigated through observations of the co lines in several studies using various existing telescopes ( e.g. , for @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and for @xmath0co(_j_=21 ) : @xcite ) .",
    "these studies provide us with essential physical properties of gmcs , including molecular gas masses , sizes , line widths , and virial parameters .",
    "recent observations using the _ herschel _ pacs and spire instruments have investigated the far - infrared and sub - millimeter pictures of the cold interstellar medium in m33 ( herm33es project : e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these observation results , understanding the formation process of dense molecular gas within gmcs is a critical step in understanding the physical connection between gmc properties and the evolutionary phases of gmcs .",
    "multi - line observations are indispensable tools for achieving this understanding .",
    "recent studies have shown that the molecular lines with high critical density and/or those of high rotational excitation level are closely associated with massive star formation in external galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the hcn emission in ngc6951 shows a better spatial correlation with the star - forming regions than the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) emission ; @xcite reported the existence of tight ir - hcn linear correlation in spiral galaxies , which indicates that the global star formation rate ( sfr ) is proportional to the mass of dense molecular gas .",
    "@xcite showed the relation between @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) emission and the sfr at the centers of 28 nearby galaxies .",
    "more recently , the 10-m antenna of atacama submillimeter - wave telescope experiment ( aste : @xcite ; @xcite ) was used to conduct a wide - area survey of the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line toward the inner disk region of the nearby starburst galaxy m83 @xcite , revealing an intimate connection between dense molecular gas and massive star formation at a spatial scale of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the above mentioned studies are based on observations with resolutions greater than a few @xmath8 , and therefore , observations with higher resolutions are required to study the properties of warm and dense gas in gmcs .",
    "some case studies of dense gas properties in gmcs have been conducted for nearby galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) including m33 ; a recent high - resolution ( @xmath9 ) study of ngc604 , the most active star - forming region in m33 , found an the arclike distribution of @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) emission , which is possibly formed through compression by stellar winds and/or supernovae shocks of previously formed stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , aperture - synthesis observations of ngc604 by @xcite revealed that star - forming efficiency decreases as the projected distance from the heart of the central cluster increases .",
    "furthermore , they detected hcn emission from two massive gmcs at the rim of  h@xmath2 shells \" produced by the cluster .",
    "their result indicates that the evolutionary stages of gmcs change radially in the course of stellar cluster formation .",
    "another study of ngc604 using a large velocity gradient model for @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) , @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) , and @xmath10co(_j_=10 ) showed that the temperature and density of gmcs vary , reflecting their evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "for conducting statistical surveys of dense molecular gas in m33 , examination of higher - j co lines such as @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) in the emission spectra of gmcs can be useful , because these lines are very bright as compared with the emission lines of high dipole moment molecules such as hcn and hco+ .",
    "for instance , two gmcs in ngc604 whose hcn emissions were detected through interferometric observations show a hcn - to - co flux ratio ( flux unit : @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 , of @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported no detection of hcn emission from four gmcs in m33 at @xmath15 resolution , which set very small upper limits of the hcn - to - co intensity ratio ( the intensity is measured in @xmath16 ; hereinafter , the same unit is considered for intensity ) , @xmath17 , from @xmath18 down to @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , for other galaxies , @xcite reported very small @xmath17 ratios down to @xmath201/90 in the disk regions of m51 , and similar ratios were observed for a few 10-pc scale observations of gmcs in m31 @xcite . in contrast , the @xmath21 ratios are usually greater than 1/10 even in the disk regions of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; therefore , the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line is suitable for whole disk surveys of gmcs .    in this work",
    ", we present a study of the warm and dense molecular components of gmcs in m33 .",
    "we investigated these components using a combination of a high - quality on - the - fly ( otf ) map of @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) emission obtained using the aste 10-m telescope and that of @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) emission obtained by the nro 45-m telescope . in this study , we have specifically focused only on the physical properties of gmcs ; we will use a @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) wide - area image and detailed map - based studies in a soon - to - be - published paper by @xcite .",
    "this work is part of the nobeyama radio observatory m33 all - disk survey of giant molecular clouds ( nro magic ) project @xcite .",
    "we first selected target regions that cover the majority of gmcs in m33 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] .",
    "subsequently , we conducted @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) observations using the aste telescope , with a total area coverage of 121 arcmin@xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the observations were performed from june to september 2010 and in november 2011 using the otf observation mode @xcite .",
    "the front - end component was a cartridge - type sideband - separating receiver for the aste 345-ghz band ( cats345 : @xcite ) .",
    "we calibrated the antenna temperature using the standard chopper - wheel technique .",
    "the main beam efficiency was @xmath24 at the frequency of the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line .",
    "the temperature scale used throughout this paper is the main - beam brightness temperature ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the typical system noise temperature during the observations was less than @xmath26 in the single sideband ( see @xcite for a more detailed description of the observations ) .",
    "the angular resolution of all images is @xmath27 .",
    "we regridded the images so that their spatial and velocity coordinates matched with the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) data ; the pixel scale is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and the velocity resolution is @xmath30 .",
    "the rms noise was typically 18@xmath31 .",
    "we used the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) data cube from @xcite .",
    "this data was obtained using the nro 45-m telescope and the 25-beam receiver bears .",
    "a field of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) was mapped using the otf technique . in that study ,",
    "the main beam efficiency was @xmath34 at the frequency of the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) line .",
    "the errors in the scaling factors of bears were smaller than @xmath35% .",
    "the data cube had a velocity width of @xmath36 , which adequately covers the full velocity extent of the emission in the observed area .",
    "its velocity resolution was @xmath37 .",
    "the angular resolution and the grid spacing were @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the rms noise was @xmath40 .",
    "we calculated the sfr using the formulation by @xcite , where the sfr is derived from a linear combination of the h@xmath2 line and 24-@xmath3continuum emission .",
    "we used the h@xmath2 image provided by @xcite and the 24-@xmath3image from the spitzer space telescope data archive .",
    "these images were convolved into a @xmath41 beam , regridded to a pixel scale of @xmath28 to match the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) data , and finally combined .",
    "the rms noises in the h@xmath2 and 24-@xmath3maps result in a @xmath42 error of @xmath43 and a sensitivity limit of @xmath44 .",
    "a more detailed description of the sfr analyses are presented in @xcite .",
    "we set the criteria for gmc identification from our @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) data cube as follows :",
    "( i ) pixels with the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) brightness temperature @xmath45 should be above the noise limit ( see below for details ) ( ii ) all pixels in the cube should be conjunct , ( iii ) the gmcs should contain at least three pixels at a velocity channel , and ( iv ) the sizes and velocity widths should be larger than the spatial and velocity resolutions , respectively .",
    "first , we applied the clumpfind algorithm developed by @xcite to the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) data cube in order to roughly identify the boundaries of the gmcs and obtain their masses .",
    "the clumpfind algorithm requires a search increment and the lowest level that is the same as the noise limit as an input parameter set .",
    "we searched the most suitable parameter set to minimize misidentification of gmcs and assessed the validity of gmc identification by testing many parameter sets and examining the resultant channel maps of each gmc candidate . in this process , we rejected the parameter sets that resulted in the identification of mere aggregations of widespread small clumps as single large clump candidates . in such cases ,",
    "the small clumps were not connected with each other in either space or velocity domains .",
    "we also rejected the parameter sets with which most clumps were divided into unreasonably small fragments such as those smaller than the spatial and velocity resolutions . as a result of this parameter search",
    ", we adopted the search increment @xmath46 and the lowest level @xmath47 and roughly identified the gmc candidates .",
    "subsequently , we removed the isolated pixels that were incorrectly allocated in some of the gmc candidates .",
    "finally , we rejected the gmc candidates that were close to the rim of the data cube as well as the ones whose sizes and velocity widths were smaller than the spatial and velocity resolutions .",
    "we successfully determined 74 gmcs that were also contained in our target fields of @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) .",
    "their galactocentric distance ranges from 0.2 to @xmath1 .",
    "the h@xmath48 gas mass of each gmc is calculated from the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) data assuming the @xmath0co - to - h@xmath48 conversion factor @xmath49 @xcite .",

    "our criterion for detection in @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) is that the spectra show emission above the 3-sigma level . the rms noise level for each spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "25 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 72 , 73 ) .",
    "although some of these spectra show multiple peaks , the velocity components of the sub - peaks are excluded from the gmcs in the process of identification .",
    "thus , each gmc corresponds only to the main peak in each spectrum .",
    "we fitted the main peaks in these spectra with a single gaussian to obtain the integrated intensities of co lines at the peak positions of the gmcs .",

    "[ fig : co3210 ] shows the plot of @xmath51 versus @xmath52 of the gmcs in m33 .",
    "we found that the correlation between @xmath51 and @xmath52 still holds at the gmc scale with the correlation coefficient of 0.65 , whereas @xmath54 is spread over a wide range from less than 0.1 to 0.74 . when weighted by the measurement uncertainty , the @xmath4 mean is 0.26 .",
    "the gmcs that are not detected for @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) emission are not used for averaging .",
    "this value of @xmath4 is fairly low as compared with the disk - averaged @xmath0co(_j_=21)/@xmath0co(_j_=10 ) of 0.73 discussed by @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the temperature and local volume density at the gmc center is generally not very high at the resolution of @xmath50 .",
    "although the gmcs we detected are predominantly located in spiral arms , the @xmath4 value is slightly smaller than that of the arm region of the milky way galaxy ( @xmath55 , @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : cosfr ] shows the plot of @xmath42 against @xmath52 and @xmath51 at the @xmath45 peak position in each gmc .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath42 is integrated over all the velocity components in the line of sight , whereas the @xmath52 and @xmath51 values correspond only to the velocity extent of the gmc . because the sub - components in the co spectra of most gmcs are smaller than the main component , this effect on @xmath42",
    "is estimated to be a factor of less than 2 .",
    "this figure shows a clear correlation between @xmath51 and @xmath42 , with the correlation coefficient being 0.68 .",

    "this result is consistent with that obtained by @xcite ; their study showed that the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity and the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) luminosity were better correlated than the fir luminosity and the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) luminosity in infrared - luminous galaxies with resolutions of @xmath60 .",
    "our result is also consistent with that of @xcite ; they presented an identical result for the nuclei of dozens of nearby galaxies , with a typical resolution of @xmath61 , and obtained a correlation in the @xmath62 range of @xmath63 .",

    "[ fig : cosfr ] , even in the gmc scale of @xmath65 .",
    "this correlation can be attributed to the higher density and/or temperature of the gas that is traced with the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line .",
    "that is , because the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line traces denser gas ( with a critical density of @xmath66 ) than that traced by the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) line , with @xmath67 , a good correlation is expected , as seen between the hcn intensity and the sfr , even up to the dense core scale @xcite .",
    "furthermore , star - forming activities heat the surrounding gas , and consequently , the co molecules in the gas are excited to show stronger _ j_=32 line emission . because the co @xmath68 level is 33 k above the ground state and the co @xmath69 level is 5.5 k , we can also expect that the correlation between the sfr and the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line emission is better than that between the sfr and @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) line emission .    as we have shown in the previous subsection ,",
    "the integrated intensities of @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) and @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) are well correlated with each other , at the peak positions of @xmath45 in each gmc , at a resolution of @xmath70pc .",
    "further , considering that @xmath42 and @xmath51 are better correlated than @xmath42 and @xmath52 , we expect a radial gradient of emissions of the co lines and the sfr tracers in the gmcs . from the center of the gmcs to that of the hii regions , we observe peaks of @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) , @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) , and h@xmath2 + 24@xmath71 m .",
    "the existence of the radial gradient can be inspected by directly comparing the maps of @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) , @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) , and the sfr tracers .",
    "the results of this comparison will be presented in our forthcoming paper .      as mentioned above",
    ", the emission of the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line is more closely related to the sfr than that of the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) line is .",
    "moreover , it is probable that @xmath4 depends on the properties of the gmcs , such as their mass .",
    "for example , in our galaxy , clouds with masses greater than @xmath72 have denser and warmer cores than those with masses less than @xmath72 ( @xcite ) .    fig .",

    "the red circles indicate the gmcs with a high star - forming activity ( @xmath73 ) , and the blue ones indicate those with a low star - forming activity ( @xmath74 ) . here , in order to check whether @xmath4 shows mass - dependency , we divide the sample in half at @xmath75 .",
    "the crosses indicate the averages of @xmath4 in each mass bin ; these averages are taken for gmcs with high and low star - forming activities .",

    "it should be noted that @xmath76 for the 23 less star - forming , less - massive gmcs is a value averaged over upper - limit values .",
    "we found that the gmcs with high star - forming activity tend to show a high @xmath4 value .",
    "moreover , the mass - dependent trend of @xmath4 in the gmcs with a low star - forming activity is apparent .",
    "we found that @xmath77% of the gmcs with @xmath78 show @xmath79 , whereas none of the gmcs with @xmath80 have such a small value of @xmath4 .",
    "this difference between the massive and less - massive gmcs is the reason for the appearance of a blank in the lower - right portion of this plot .",
    "it also appears in the averaged @xmath4 : the difference between the mean upper - limit value of 0.14 for less star - forming , less - massive gmcs and the mean value of 0.24 for less star - forming , massive gmcs is significant : it is larger than the measurement uncertainties . because the @xmath42 in the less star - forming gmcs does not greatly depend on gmc mass , the mass - dependent trend of @xmath4",
    "is attributed to factors other than @xmath42 . on the other hand , @xmath4 in the gmcs with a high star - forming activity",
    "does not significantly differ between the massive and less - massive gmcs : the difference between the average values of @xmath4 , i.e. , 0.37 and 0.31 , is comparable with the measurement uncertainties .",

    "<S> we report the results of our observations of the @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) and @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line emission of 74 major giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) within the galactocentric distance of @xmath1 in the local group galaxy m33 . </S>",
    "<S> the observations have been conducted as part of the nobeyama radio observatory m33 all - disk survey of giant molecular clouds project ( nro magic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial resolutions are 80pc for @xmath0co(_j_=10 ) and 100pc for @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detect @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) emission of 65 gmcs successfully . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the correlation between the surface density of the star formation rate , which is derived from a linear combination of h@xmath2 and 24@xmath3emissions , and the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) integrated intensity still holds at this scale . </S>",
    "<S> this result show that the star - forming activity is closely associated with warm and dense gases that are traced with the @xmath0co(_j_=32 ) line , even in the scale of gmcs . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the gmcs with a high star - forming activity tend to show a high integrated intensity ratio ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also observe a mass - dependent trend of @xmath4 for the gmcs with a low star - forming activity . from these results , we speculate that the @xmath4 values of the gmcs with a low star - forming activity mainly depend on the dense gas fraction and not on the temperature , and therefore , the dense gas fraction increases with the mass of gmcs , at least in the gmcs with a low star - forming activity . </S>"
