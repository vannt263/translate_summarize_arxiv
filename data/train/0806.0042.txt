    "according to the theory that best reproduces the observations , galaxy formation proceeds in a hierarchical fashion , driven by gravity , in a universe dominated by dark matter of unknown nature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the hierarchy of merging is accompanied by changes in galaxy structure and morphology . in particular early - type galaxies ( es and s0s )",
    "are thought to form by the gas - rich merging of spiral galaxies or by gas starvation of spirals , followed by subsequent collisionless mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "three key global parameters can be used to characterize galaxies structure while studying this sequence of merging of galaxies and dark matter : ( i ) the angular momentum , which varies during mergers and increases with the amount of gas dissipation , ( ii ) the stellar population , which records the history of star formation events during the gas - rich mergers , and ( iii ) the mass - to - light ratio , which is affected by both the population and by the dark - matter fraction .",
    "the large majority of the galaxies in the universe are to first order axisymmetric ( except for bars ) and posses disks .",
    "this includes fast - rotator early - type galaxies @xcite and spiral galaxies .",
    "both the fast - rotator early - types @xcite and the spiral galaxies @xcite appear dominated by the stellar matter inside one half - light radius .",
    "observations suggest that they have a dynamical structure characterized by a flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the @xmath7 direction parallel to the galaxy symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to include the knowledge of the structure of the fast - rotator and spiral galaxies , into a realistic but simple dynamical modeling method , which can be applied to the measurement of both the mass - to - light ratio and the amount of rotation ( for which the inclination is needed ) in the central regions of these galaxies , while also allowing for the inclusion of dark matter and the study of multiple kinematical components .",
    "the success of the adopted model s assumptions in describing the kinematics of real galaxies is verified against integral - field observations of the stellar kinematics obtained with ` sauron `  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : solving_jeans ] we briefly review the theory and past applications of the jeans equations and of the shape of the velocity ellipsoid in galaxies . in section  [ sec : anisotropic_jeans_solutions ] we describe our new anisotropic jeans formalism , which we apply and test in section  [ sec : tests ] .",

    "additional assumptions and simplifications are required for a practical application of the equation .",
    "one classic way of constraining the problem consists of drastically reducing it , from that of recovering the df , to that of studying only the velocity moments of the df .",
    "this approach leads to the jeans equations , which are discussed in the next section .",

    "they do _ not _ require self consistency ( a potential @xmath11 generated by the luminosity density @xmath21 ) and they make no assumption on the df .",
    "however , even if one assumes @xmath11 to be known ( it may be derived from the observed @xmath21 via the poisson equation ) , the two equations  ( [ eq : jeans_cyl_r ] ) and ( [ eq : jeans_cyl_z ] ) are still a function of the four unknown @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and do not uniquely specify a solution .",
    "given that the axisymmetric jeans equations relate four functions of the meridional plane @xmath1 coordinates , one needs to specify at least two functions of @xmath1 for a unique solution . a natural way to provide a unique solution for the jeans equations consists of specifying the shape and orientation of the intersection of the velocity ellipsoid everywhere in the meridional plane .",
    "in fact the three components @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 , of the velocity dispersion tensor , uniquely describe the equation of the velocity dispersion ellipse , whose shape can be derived by diagonalizing the tensor .",

    "the most common choice which is made consists of assuming a circular velocity - ellipsoid in the meridional plane ( sometimes called semi - isotropy condition ) .",
    "this assumption implies @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and is sufficient to ` close ' the set of equations to provide a unique solution for the remaining variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "for this reason the semi - isotropic jeans models are often called two - integral jeans models .    in this paper",
    "we are investigating whether it is possible to make an alternative assumption on the shape of the velocity ellipsoid , which retains the simplicity of the widely used semi - isotropic assumption , while also providing a better description of real galaxies and still leading to an efficient solution of the jeans equations .",
    "due to its simplicity , the semi - isotropy assumption has proven remarkably useful in a large variety of applications of the jeans equations .",

    "although these models have been largely superseded by @xcite orbit - superposition method , when good kinematic data are available and the maximum generality is required , they are becoming useful to study the mass - to - light ratios and rotation of galaxies at high - redshift , where the data quality still does not justify more sophisticated approaches @xcite .      to explore the possibility of making a simple but sufficiently realistic assumption on the shape and orientation of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane of axisymmetric galaxies , we need to understand what that shape is expected to be",
    ".      a qualitative insight into the orientation of the velocity ellipse in real galaxies can start from the analysis of the special case of separable potentials @xcite . in an axisymmetric oblate",
    "separable potential the equations of motion for the stellar obits can be separated in a prolate spheroidal coordinates system @xmath36 which also defines the boundaries of the orbits . in other words the orbital motions can be written as the linear combination of two independent oscillations in @xmath37 and @xmath21 , plus a non - uniform rotation around the symmetry axis .",
    "for this reason the velocity ellipse is aligned with the coordinate system and the cross term @xmath38 vanishes @xcite .",
    "the prolate spheroidal coordinates are characterized by the fact that they tend to be aligned with the cylindrical coordinates @xmath14 at small radii and with the polar ones @xmath39 at large radii .",
    "separable potentials are characterized by a central constant - density region .",
    "the cylindrical alignment happens in that region , as the stars there tend to move like an harmonic oscillator .",
    "for these reasons one expects the velocity dispersion ellipse to be cylindrically aligned at small radii and radially aligned at large radii .",
    "the gravitational potential of real galaxies is _ not _ of the separable form .",
    "separable potentials are in fact necessarily characterized by smooth analytic centers , while real galaxies possess central singularities due to cusped density profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "still , numerical integrations of orbits in non - separable axisymmetric potentials show that most of them are still bounded by curves , which qualitatively resemble the spheroidal coordinates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason one can expect the velocity dispersion ellipse to behave in real galaxies in a way that is qualitatively similar to the separable case .",
    "numerical calculations confirm this fact in non - separable triaxial and axisymmetric potentials @xcite . in the limit of a point mass",
    ", the velocity ellipsoid has to be spherically aligned for symmetry .",
    "this suggests that at small radii , where the supermassive black hole or the stellar cusp dominates , the velocity ellipsoid in real galaxies should be more spherically oriented than in the separable case .",
    "the df of a stationary system is a function of the three separable integrals of motion @xcite . in general it",
    "can not be recovered from real galaxies without at least another three - dimensional observable quantity .",
    "this quantity is now being provided by integral - field observations of the stellar kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allow the stellar line - of - sight velocity - distribution to be measured at every position of the galaxy image on the sky .",
    "we used these observations , in combination with orbit - based three - integral axisymmetric models , to measure the shape and orientation of the velocity ellipsoid at every position within the meridional plane ( within one half - light radius ) , for a sample of 25 early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] qualitatively summarizes the main findings of that paper regarding the shape of the velocity dispersion ellipsoid for the fast - rotator galaxies : ( i ) the ellipsoids qualitatively behave like in separable potentials and already near 1  they are essentially spherically oriented ; ( ii ) the axial ratio of the ellipsoids varies gradually as a function of the polar angle , in such a way that the ellipsoid has nearly the same shape on both the equatorial plane ( where the density is the highest ) and the symmetry axis .",
    "the net effect is that to first order the global anisotropy of the galaxies can be described as a simple flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the @xmath7-direction ( @xmath40 ) .     of the fast - rotator early - type galaxies ( derived from @xcite ) .",
    "the ellipses show the intersection of the velocity ellipsoid with the @xmath41 plane .",
    "the solid lines show a representative prolate spheroidal system of coordinates .",
    "the dashed line is a representative iso - density contour .",

    "we examine advantages and problems of each one in turn .",
    "the observed behavior of the ellipsoid could be approximated by solving the jeans equations in prolate spheroidal coordinates in a generic axisymmetric potential @xcite . to qualitatively reproduce the behavior of fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] , the simplest realistic model would need at least four free parameters .",
    "two parameters are required to define the coordinate system .",
    "a third parameter could define the shape of the velocity ellipse on the equatorial plane and another parameter would describe the angular variation .",
    "a problem of this approach is that the general solution , to derive the observables for realistic galaxy potentials , requires at least a computationally - expensive triple numerical quadrature .",
    "the derived equations are also rather cumbersome and not justified by the fact that these models can at best provide a qualitative description of real galaxies . for these reasons",
    "those solutions have currently only been applied to a handful of analytic potentials , and no application to real galaxies exist .",
    "given that the velocity ellipsoids in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] are nearly spherically aligned , a much simpler choice would consist of solving the anisotropic jeans equation in spherical coordinates . a solution for this case",
    "was presented by @xcite and applied to real galaxies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however even under this spherical assumption the solution still has the same form as in the spheroidal coordinates .",
    "the computation still involves a triple numerical quadrature .",
    "this is in fact a generic feature of the axisymmetric jeans solution : even in the simple case in which the density is assumed to be stratified on similar oblate spheroids , one quadrature is needed to obtain the potential , a second quadrature provides the intrinsic velocity s second moments and a third quadrature finally gives the projected observables . in the spherically - oriented case",
    "the coordinates system has no free parameters and the simplest realistic model to reproduce fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] could have two parameters ( anisotropy and its angular variation ) .      a more radical alternative is to assume the velocity ellipse is oriented with the cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "this option was tested by e.g.  @xcite , however until now , for the reasons described in section  [ sec : spheroidal ] , it was not considered a sensible choice to describe the shape of the velocity ellipsoid in real galaxies .",
    "our new results , based on the ` sauron `  integral - field observations @xcite , make this choice worth exploring again .",
    "this option can not provide a formally accurate representation of fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] , however it is accurate near the equatorial plane , where the density is at its maximum , and near the minor axis . models with cylindrically - oriented velocity ellipsoid provide a good qualitative description of the empirical observation that the global anisotropy in fast - rotator galaxies is best characterized as a flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the vertical @xmath7-direction ( * ? ? ? * their fig .  2 ) .",
    "the near - cylindrical orientation of the velocity ellipsoid may be due to the presence of disks , where this orientation appears natural .",
    "for this reason the cylindrical orientation is certainly appropriate to describe the dynamics of spiral galaxies @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we show that the assumption of a cylindrically - aligned velocity - dispersion ellipsoid , combined with the powerful multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) method of @xcite , can generate simple solutions that well reproduce the integral - field kinematics of real galaxies , and also allow for variable mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. dark matter ) , spatially varying anisotropy and multiple kinematical components .",
    "all this while still requiring a _ single _ numerical quadrature to predict the observables on the sky plane ( or any other projection ) .",
    "we start from the general axisymmetric jeans equations ( [ eq : jeans_cyl_r ] ) and ( [ eq : jeans_cyl_z ] ) and we make the following two assumptions : ( i ) the velocity ellipsoid is aligned with the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath14 and ( ii ) the anisotropy is constant and quantified by @xmath42 . in this case",

    "a general caveat regarding the jeans equations is that the existence of a solution does not guarantee the existence of a corresponding physical positive df .",
    "this can only be verified using different techniques .      to derive solutions for the jeans equations we make an explicit choice for the parametrization of the stellar density and the total density ( which can include dark matter and a central black hole ) .",

    "the ratio of the kinetic energy @xmath240 along the direction of the symmetry @xmath7-axis and the kinetic energy @xmath241 along a direction orthogonal to it , is only a function of the galaxy shape ( equation  [ 4 - 91 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of increasing the anisotropy @xmath3 is simply that of redistributing the same kinetic energy @xmath241 from the tangential to the radial direction .",
    "this reduces the velocity second moments along the galaxy projected major axis , while correspondingly increasing them along the minor axis .",
    "the projected luminosity - weighted second moments , from which the @xmath0 is measured , remain nearly unchanged when averaged over the full galaxy image .",
    "the virial equations also provide a qualitative understanding of why the observations can constrain the inclination of an axisymmetric galaxy ( section  [ sec : inc_recovery ] ) .",
    "in fact they state that the ratio @xmath242 increases with galaxy flattening .",
    "in other words , for a given projected surface brightness , a flat system needs more kinetic energy in a direction parallel to its the equatorial plane , to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .    the fast rotator ngc  2974 of fig .",
    "[ fig : models_beta_inc ] shows high velocity second moments along the projected major axis .",
    "although the galaxy does not appear very flat in projection , its kinematics is already an indication that the system is likely to be intrinsically flat .",
    "a flat model has more kinetic energy in the equatorial plane and will be able to easily reproduce the high @xmath112 along the major axis , without invoking extreme tangential anisotropy . a quantitative example , using both the first and second velocity moments , of how the tensor virial equations can be used to constrain the galaxy inclination is presented in fig .",
    "11 of @xcite .",
    "there we showed that the  diagram of @xcite can be used to provide a qualitative estimate of the inclination of fast - rotators galaxies , given some assumptions on the anisotropy .    although the virial equations can be used to estimate the @xmath0 and the inclination of galaxies , they have some obvious limitations : ( i ) they do not allow one to make full use of the spatial information contained in the integral - field observations .",
    "the whole two - dimensional kinematics is reduced to one number ; ( ii ) they do not allow the limited spatial extent of the kinematics to be properly taken into account ; ( iii ) they do not easily deal with non - similar isophotes and multiple photometric components in galaxies .",
    "we present a generalization of the widely used semi - isotropic ( two - integral ) axisymmetric jeans modeling method to describe the stellar dynamics of galaxies .",
    "our method uses the powerful multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) technique to accurately parameterize the galaxies photometry .",
    "it represents an anisotropic extension of what was presented in the semi - isotropic case by @xcite , and it maintains its simplicity and computational efficiency .",
    "we assume ( i ) a constant mass - to - light ratio and ( ii ) a velocity ellipsoid which is aligned with the cylindrical @xmath1 coordinates and has a flattening quantified by the classical @xmath7-anisotropy parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath7 is the galaxy symmetry axis .",
    "we test the technique using ` sauron `  integral - field observations of the stellar kinematics @xcite for a small set of fast - rotator galaxies with a variety of kinematical properties .",
    "for galaxies that are constrained by the photometry to be close to edge - on we find that , although in the semi - isotropic limit ( @xmath198 ) the models do not provide a good description of the data , the variation of the _ single _ global anisotropy @xmath3 is generally sufficient to accurately predict the shape of both the first ( @xmath4 ) and second ( @xmath243 ) velocity moments , once an detailed mge parametrization of the photometry is given . an accurate description of the photometry , including ellipticity variations and disky isophotes , appears crucial to reproduce in detail the features of the kinematics .",
    "in all cases we find that @xmath234 , while generally @xmath221 with good accuracy .",
    "this confirms previous findings on the dynamical structure of these galaxies , showing that their velocity ellipsoid tends to be oblate @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy derived with our anisotropic jeans dynamical modeling method agrees within the errors with the one previously measured using a more general schwarzschild approach .    for fast - rotator galaxies that are _",
    "not _ constrained by the photometry to be close to edge - on , we find that in general the inclination @xmath59 ( or the corresponding galaxy shape ) and the anisotropy @xmath3 are highly correlated and can not be independently determined .",
    "however , if we introduce the observationally - motivated constraint @xmath234 , the inclination becomes constrained to a narrow range of values and it agrees with independent determinations when those are available .",
    "we are applying this method to determine the inclination , the mass - to - light ratio and the amount of rotation of a large sample of galaxies for which integral field kinematics are available . for galaxies close to edge - on , the global anisotropy or the dynamical structure of different galaxy subcomponents ( e.g.  bulge and disk ) can also be investigated .",
    "we are using this method to test independent determinations of the masses of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of fast - rotator galaxies .",
