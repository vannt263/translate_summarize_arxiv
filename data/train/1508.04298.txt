    "<S> , we quantify the mechanical duffing nonlinearity . by increasing the drive force </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a decrease in the mechanical dissipation rate at large amplitudes , suggesting a negative nonlinear damping mechanism in the graphene resonator . increasing the optomechanical backaction </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a nonlinear regime not described by a duffing response that includes new instabilities of the mechanical response .    </S>",
    "<S> the unique properties of graphene such as atomic thickness , low mass density , and high modulus of rigidity make it very attractive material for nanoscale electromechanical systems ( nems ) for several technological applications . after the first demonstration of few layer thick graphene nems @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , there has been an extensive studies on graphene nanoelectromechanical systems ranging from electromechanical resonators @xcite , oscillators @xcite and optomechanical systems aiming to probe the quantum regime of graphene motion @xcite . in this pursuit , large mechanical quality factors in graphene based nems have been demonstrated as well @xcite . due to its atomic thickness , graphene based nems also exhibit rich nonlinearity such as onset of duffing nonlinearity and nonlinear damping at realativly small mechanical amplitudes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these properties further makes graphene an attractive candidate for developing optomechanical systems to reach the quantum regime of graphene motion @xcite , to store microwave photons @xcite , and could possibly be useful to understand dissipation in graphene nems for improved device performance @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between mechanical resonator and optical / superconducting microwave cavities has enabled the detection of mechanical motion with excellent sensitivities @xcite , offering an attractive platform to characterize the nonlinear response of mechanical resonators . in this letter , we study non - linear dynamics of a multilayer graphene resonator by means of coupling it to a superconducting microwave cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the graphene resonator is driven by injecting two microwave tones in the cavity , which are detuned by the mechanical resonant frequency leading to an oscillating radiation pressure force which drives the mechanical resonator . by changing the amplitude of these tones </S>",
    "<S> , we can independently control the driving force and dissipation due to the optomechanical backaction forces . </S>",
    "<S> we drive the mechanical resonator into the duffing regime and characterize the nonlinearity . with increase in the driving force , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a reduction in linear dissipation rate , large hysteresis with sweep direction , and an instability in the mechanical amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> our device consists of a multilayer graphene resonator coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity as studied previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a shows a scanning electron microscope image of a multilayer graphene resonator coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the multilayer graphene mechanical resonator is 10  nm thick and is suspended above a gate electrode of the microwave feedline by approximately 150  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting cavity is in a quarter wavelength coplanar waveguide geometry fabricated with an alloy of molybdenum and rhenium ( @xmath0  9  k ) on an intrinsic silicon substrate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are performed in a dilution refrigerator under vacuum at 14  mk . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting cavity has a resonance frequency of @xmath1  ghz , with an internal dissipation rate @xmath2  khz and coupled to a feedline with an external coupling rate @xmath3  khz ( coupling fraction @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the graphene resonator forms a mechanically compliant capacitor to the microwave feedline as shown schematically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b . </S>",
    "<S> motion of graphene resonator modulates the capacitance and hence the cavity frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the graphene resonator has a resonance frequency of @xmath5mhz . using thermal noise </S>",
    "<S> , we calibrate the optomechanical coupling defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the quantum zero - point fluctuations of the mechanical resonator to be @xmath8  hz @xcite , which also provides an absolute calibration of displacement amplitudes .    in order to probe mechanical response , we take advantage of the optomechanical coupling and sideband resolved limit ( @xmath9 ) in an optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) setup . in omit setup , two microwave fields are injected inside the cavity . a strong drive field @xmath10 at lower mechanical sideband frequency @xmath11 and a weak probe field @xmath12 measures the cavity response by sweeping the probe tone in the vicinity of @xmath13 . when the detuning between drive and probe fields @xmath14 matches @xmath15 , the mechanical resonator experiences coherent radiation pressure force . </S>",
    "<S> coherent response of the mechanical resonator to the radiation pressure force up - scatter the drive field exactly at @xmath16 leading to an interference with the original probe field measuring the cavity response . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is called optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) @xcite as described schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing out that unlike heterodyne mixing schemes with low frequency rf drive , the radiation pressure force drive eliminates the need to apply a dc gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while the strength of the probe tone allows to control the driving force on the mechanical resonator , independently the drive tone can be used to tune the dissipation in the mechanical resonator using the optomechanically backaction .    </S>",
    "<S> for an overcoupled single port cavity , the interference between the probe field and upconverted field ( drive being at lower motional sideband ) leads to an absorption feature at low driving powers as shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) . in the linear response limit , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting reflection coefficient of the cavity can be written as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the susceptibility of the mechanical resonator , @xmath19 is the suspectibility of the cavity , @xmath20 is the mechanical dissipation rate , @xmath21 is the many - photon optomechanical coupling strength , and @xmath22 is the number of the drive photons . in the limit @xmath23 , the measurement of the optomechanical induced absorption ( omia ) allows to directly probe the responsivity of the mechanical resonator giving its amplitude and dissipation rate , thus making it a sensitive technique .    for a red - sideband drive @xmath11 , the minimum value of the reflection coefficient is given by much simplified expression @xmath24 , where optomechanical cooperativity @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 . in the limit of no optomechanical coupling ( @xmath27 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we recover @xmath28 expression for minimum for a single port reflection cavity , which sets the base line of omia feature . </S>",
    "<S> the linewidth of absorption feature is given by @xmath29 , where the additional term @xmath30 originates from the backaction effects of drive photons and can be tuned by @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , amplitude of the mechanical resonator can also be cast into a convenient form , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to see that for low cooperativity @xmath32 , the mechanical amplitude can be tuned by both the probe and drive tone as @xmath33 . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath34 , </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical amplitude is proportional to @xmath35 , suggesting that an increase in drive field leads to optomechanical damping and hence a reduction in the mechanical amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in the probe field , however , in both cases drives the mechanical resonator harder and yields larger amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig 3 , we probe the omia response in detail by varying the number of intracavity probe photons @xmath36 , hence the driving force , while keeping the number of drive photons fixed at @xmath37 and @xmath38 . at low number of probe photons , </S>",
    "<S> the omia feature is determined by the linear response of the mechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath36 is increased further , the nonlinearity in the omia response becomes evident with a stiffening of the mechanical resonator ( positive shift in the resonance frequency ) and the shark - fin like duffing response accompanied by hysteresis with respect to frequency sweep - direction .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the clear duffing response , with the exception of the bottom two curves , it can also be seen that the omia dip on the non - linear regime becomes deeper . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the observation of a deeper omia dip when @xmath36 is increased can be understood from a reduction of the mechanical damping rate as the resonator is driven to larger amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> such a decreased mechanical damping rate would give a larger cooperativity and thus a deeper omia dip . </S>",
    "<S> in the last two curves , the cooperativity is continuing to increase , but the omia dip becomes less deep as the cavity has now crossed over to an effective undercoupled regime ( see supplementary info of ref @xcite for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the deeper omia dip that is suggestive of a decreased mechanical damping at higher drive forces , fig  3 also shows additional features . </S>",
    "<S> comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) , smaller and larger @xmath22 respectively , the mechanical linewidth in panel ( b ) is significantly larger . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of increased optomechanical damping , which also explains the absence of hysteresis and shows only a transition to a duffing response at higher powers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in panel ( b ) , at the highest drive forces , we also observe an instability in the response in the form of a spike in reverse frequency sweep .    to gain quantitative insight into these observations , we perform numerical fits on the data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear response can be primarily captured by including a duffing term @xmath39 in the restoring force of the mechanical resonator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following ref  @xcite , we perform numerical fits to extract the linear mechanical dissipation rate ( @xmath20 ) , mechanical amplitude ( @xmath40 ) , and the duffing parameter ( @xmath41 ) for any given probe and drive power . </S>",
    "<S> the gray curve in fig  4(a ) is the numerical fitted curve overlaid on top of the experimentally measured data allowing us to extract the duffing parameter to be @xmath42  kgm@xmath43s@xmath43 . using the analytical expression for the onset of duffing bifurcation point @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath45  kgm@xmath43s@xmath43 , which is close to the result we get by performing numerical fits . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(b , c ) plot the linear damping rate with the amplitude of the resonator extracted by performing numerical fits on datasets shown in fig .  3 . </S>",
    "<S> at low amplitude , we observe mechanical damping rates @xmath20 of @xmath46  hz ( @xmath47 ) for @xmath48 , while for higher amplitude , the damping rate drops to @xmath49  hz ( @xmath50 ) . at large number of probe photons , </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear dynamics of the omia becomes far more complex . </S>",
    "<S> the model with duffing term in the restoring force still captures the response except the instability ( sharp absorption feature in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) in the reverse frequency sweep .    </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in observed damping rate at higher amplitudes suggests the presence of a negative non - linear damping term @xmath51@xmath52 term in the equation of motion of the mechanical resonator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as this negative nonlinear damping occurs also at low cooperativities , and as it is not seen in the theoretical calculations treating the optomechanical nonlinear response , we do not believe that it is an optomechanical effect , but instead intrinsic to the graphene resonator . </S>",
    "<S> there has been also observations of nonlinear damping in nanomechanical resonators @xcite and carbon based resonators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one possible source of negative non - linear damping is the saturation of two - level - systems coupled to the mechanical resonator @xcite . at low drive powers </S>",
    "<S> , these two - level systems can absorb energy from the mechanical resonator , increasing the mechanical damping rate . at higher powers , </S>",
    "<S> the two - level systems become saturated , and the damping rate goes down . </S>",
    "<S> such an process was suggested as an explanation of power - dependent attenuation losses in glasses @xcite , and also was used to describe power - depended dielectric losses in superconducting electrical resonators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for such a saturation result in nonlinear damping effects , the level spacing of the tlss should be larger than the bath temperature . in order for tlss to describe the negative nonlinear damping observed here , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the tlss and the mechanical resonator would have to be non - resonant , mediated by strong higher order processes .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we examined the nonlinear dynamics of a graphene resonator coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity . </S>",
    "<S> in linear response limit , optomechanically - induced transparency measurements easily allows us to extract linear damping rate and peak amplitude . at moderate driving force </S>",
    "<S> when response becomes nonlinear , we perform numerical fits by including a duffing term in the mechanical restoring force and find @xmath42  kgm@xmath43s@xmath43 . increasing the driving force further , the omia response becomes complex and it is no longer captured by the duffing term . at these large amplitudes , </S>",
    "<S> higher order nonlinearities start becoming relevant and make the mechanical damping rate to appear low at larger amplitudes , where we observe a qualitatively new phenomena of negative nonlinear damping in a mechanical resonator . </S>"
