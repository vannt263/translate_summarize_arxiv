    "factorization properties of qcd allow us to calculate exclusive processes provided a hard scale is available , either the three mandelstam variables @xmath0 are large as compared to a typical hadronic scale @xmath1 where @xmath2 is of order @xmath3 ( wide - angle processes ) or there is a highly virtual photon involved ( deeply virtual processes ) . in the space - like region typical hard processes are real and virtual compton scattering or photo- and electroproduction of mesons . in these cases",
    "the process amplitudes factorize in a hard partonic subprocess ( e.g. @xmath4 ) and in soft hadronic matrix elements parameterized as generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) . for time - like processes , e.g.  two - photon annihilations into pairs of hadrons",
    ", an analogous factorization scheme holds @xcite . in this case",
    "the soft hadronic matrix elements are so - called two - hadron distribution amplitudes , time - like versions of gpds , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "one may consider more complicated topologies than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] in which @xmath5 partons are emitted and reabsorbed from the hadrons . in order to have quasi - on - shell partons entering the hadrons , a compelling requirement for factorization , @xmath6",
    "hard gluons are needed to be exchanged between the @xmath5 active partons .",
    "for very large @xmath7 and @xmath8 one may treat the hadrons in valence quark approximation .",
    "considering for instance @xmath9 with an active quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath10 ) . in this case",
    "there is no spectator left and , hence , the soft physics is encoded in two meson distribution amplitudes instead of a time - like gpd .",
    "this is an example of the so - called erbl factorization scheme which has been invented for @xmath11 in @xcite .",
    "the arguments for factorization of @xmath9 in the wide - angle region have been given in @xcite .",
    "for the ease of legibility let @xmath12 be charged pion ; the generalization to other pseudoscalar mesons is straightforward .",
    "it is of advantage to work in a symmetric ( c.m . )",
    "frame in which the pions move along the 1-axis .",
    "the light - cone plus components of the meson momenta , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are then equal : @xmath15 and the skewness , defined by @xmath16 , is 1/2 .",
    "the momentum fraction of the active quark is as usual defined by @xmath17 ; the momenta fraction of the antiquark is @xmath18 . in order to achieve the factorization in a hard process @xmath19 and a soft transition @xmath20 ,",
    "two assumptions are made in @xcite : i ) restricted transverse momenta , @xmath21 , for the active partons as well for the spectators , and ii ) all virtualities at the parton - hadron vertices are soft of order @xmath1 . with the help of these assumptions",
    "one can show that the following requirements must hold : @xmath22 where @xmath23 describes the orientation of the active parton momenta in the 12 plane .",
    "the second requirement has two solutions @xmath24 one can then derive a factorization formula for the helicity amplitudes @xmath25 where due to charge conjugation invariance @xmath26 the soft matrix element @xmath27 is expected to be strongly peaked when ( [ eq : requirements ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the two regions @xmath28 and @xmath29 where this is the case are related through a rotation by @xmath30 about the 3-axis of our coordinate frame .",
    "the hard scattering kernel @xmath31 can be taylor expanded around the 1-axis and @xmath32 @xmath33 where the labels denote the helicities of the photons ( @xmath34 ) . in terms of the c.m",
    ".  scattering angle , @xmath35 , the first term in ( [ eq : exp ] ) is proportional to @xmath36 while the second one is @xmath37 .",
    "it can then be shown @xcite that for the @xmath38 channel the first term in this expansion vanishes due to a conspiracy of charge conjugation and rotation by @xmath39 .",
    "keeping therefore only the second term in ( [ eq : exp ] ) and perform the integrals in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) one arrives at @xmath40 where the annihilation form factors encoding the soft physics , is defined by @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the two - pion distribution amplitude @xcite defined as the fourier transform of a bilocal vacuum - two - pion matrix element of quark field operators .",
    "this distribution amplitude also determines the electromagnetic form factor of the pion in the time - like region @xmath43 the energy dependences of the annihilation and electromagnetic form factors are not predicted in the handbag approach .",
    "although the @xmath44 term in ( [ eq : exp ] ) is of the same order as the parton - off - shell effects we remain with the on - shell approximation .",
    "therefore the above sketched approach to @xmath45 is to be considered as a model . the suppression of the leading term in ( [ eq : exp ] ) is special to @xmath46 ; it is due to a conspiracy of charge conjugation invariance and a rotation .",
    "this conspiracy does not occur in other reactions and the leading term in ( [ eq : exp ] ) dominates .",
    "for instance , in two - photon annihilations into baryon - antibaryon ( @xmath47 ) pairs @xcite the region @xmath48 corresponds to antiquark hadronization into a baryon which requires sea quarks with very high momentum fractions .",
    "it is unlikely that such sea quarks exist .",
    "another example is set by real compton scattering in the space - like region @xcite .",
    "the regions @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are related by charge conjugation but not by a rotation .",
    "the above handbag result for the @xmath53 channel can easily be generalized to the production of other pairs of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the corresponding differential cross section reads @xmath54 there are six pseudoscalar meson channels available in two - photon annihilations including altogether 18 annihilation form factors . to fix these form factors from experiment is a boring program .",
    "however , due to flavor symmetry ( the meson pair couples to an @xmath55-spin singlet ) and due to the absence of isospin 2 ( and @xmath56-spin 2 ) states ( because the two photons annihilate via a quark - antiquark intermediate state ) there are only two independent annihilation form factors , say @xmath57 and @xmath58 , or , in other words , a valence and a non - valence form factor .",
    "the combinations of the individual flavor contributions appearing in the various channels read in terms of the two independent form factors @xmath59    in addition there are a number of relations and triangular inequalities among the cross sections .",
    "the belle collaboration has measured the wide - angle cross sections for the six pseudoscalar meson channels up to fairly large energies @xcite .",
    "the data are compatible with a @xmath60 behavior for @xmath61 .",
    "given that fact one has only to deal with the form factors or the respective integrated cross sections .",
    "it turns out that the inequalities and relations following from flavor symmetry and isospin selection rules are satisfied within errors in general . from ( [ eq : symmetry_relations ] ) and from the statistical factor to be applied to the integrated cross section for identical particles it follows that the ratio of the @xmath62 and @xmath38 is predicted to be @xmath63 in the handbag approach . the data shown in fig.[fig : ratios ] clearly deviate from @xmath63 at low @xmath64 but seem to approach this value for @xmath65 within rapidly growing errors . a small @xmath66 admixture which may vanish for @xmath67 ,",
    "can easily explain the deviation from @xmath63 .",
    "assuming for example that the @xmath66 and @xmath68 amplitudes are in phase then an admixture @xmath69 is sufficient to explain the observed deviation .",
    "thus , the dominance of the @xmath68 amplitude is fully consistent with experiment for large @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] the ratio of the @xmath53 combination @xmath70 and the @xmath71 cross sections are shown and can be seen to be compatible with 1 according to the handbag approach , see ( [ eq : symmetry_relations ] ) .",
    "note that in the above combination of @xmath53 cross sections the interference term between the @xmath66 and @xmath68 cancels .",
    "for a few values of the energy the two basic form factors as well as their relative phase , @xmath72 , can directly be extracted from the data on , say , @xmath71 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 production . alternatively , in order to reduce errors , one may perform a combined energy - dependent fit .",
    "this fit provides @xmath75 \\label{eq : parameter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the energy dependencies of the other channels ( @xmath38 , @xmath62 , @xmath77 ) are then fixed in agreement with experiment .",
    "the relative phase varies rapidly in the charmonium region and approaches @xmath30 for @xmath67 . in concord with expectation , the non - valence form factor , @xmath78 ,",
    "is much smaller than the valence one and decreases more rapidly with increasing energy than the other one .",
    "hence , for @xmath67 only the valence form factor remains and the six cross sections all exhibit the same energy dependence and only differ in magnitude by charge factors .",
    "for the range of energy measured by belle the energy dependence of the various cross sections differ quite a bit due to the different superpositions of the valence and non - valence form factors .",
    "charged pions and kaons have the smallest contributions from the non - valence form factor .",
    "therefore , their integrated cross sections drop only slightly faster then @xmath79 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath73 ( @xmath80 ) cross section falls off rapidly with energy because of the relative strong contribution from the non - valence form factor in this case .",
    "this is in agreement with experiment as can be seen from tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] where the effective powers of @xmath64 obtained by belle from fits @xmath81 to its data are shown .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the process of interest has also been investigated in the erbl factorization scheme @xcite . in this approach",
    "the mesons are treated in valence quark approximation and the amplitudes are given by a convolution of the distribution amplitudes for the mesons and a hard scattering kernel @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the decay constant of meson @xmath84 . as for the handbag",
    "approach the cross section behaves as @xmath60 but its energy dependence is predicted to be @xmath85 , cf .  tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] .",
    "while this is in rough agreement with experiment for charged mesons the magnitude of the corresponding cross section is underestimated when it is evaluated from a distribution amplitude that is close to the asymptotic form , @xmath86 which is favored by current phenomenology and lattice results @xcite .",
    "the production of neutral meson pairs is generically suppressed , since at leading order of @xmath87 the bulk of the amplitude is proportional to a charge factor @xmath88 for a meson with quark content @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "explicit calculations @xcite yield values below 0.05 for the ratio of @xmath62 and @xmath38 cross sections which is significantly below the experimental results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] .",
    "because of charge factors the ratio of @xmath90 and @xmath71 cross sections is predicted to be even smaller . despite this suppression of the neutral meson pairs the energy dependencies of the corresponding cross sections is @xmath91 which is also in conflict with experiment , see tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] . for these reasons",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that at belle energies the production of neutral meson pairs is dominated by a contribution other then the the erbl mechanism but a quantitative study of the new contribution is lacking .",
    "the meson case can be straightforwardly generalized to the production of baryon - antibaryon pairs .",
    "an important difference is that the cross section behaves @xmath37 as has been discussed at the of sect .  1",
    "( see also ( [ eq : exp ] ) ) .",
    "due to the baryon spin there are four gpds and hence , four form factors of which one decouples in the symmetric frame .",
    "thus , the differential cross section for the production of a @xmath92 reads @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 the axial and the pseudoscalar form factors can be disentangled with polarization measurements . as for the meson case ( see ( [ eq : annff ] ) ) each form factor is a sum of individual flavor form factors ( @xmath95 ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a baryon - antibaryon distribution amplitude . for comparison the magnetic form factor of",
    "the proton reads @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] the belle data @xcite on @xmath99 are compared to the handbag results @xcite .",
    "the effective and the vector form factors are parameterized analogously to ( [ eq : parameter ] ) and the parameters fitted to the data . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] one sees that the data are nicely compatible with a @xmath100 behavior .",
    "the energy dependence of the form factors is @xmath101 , i.e.  the integrated cross section falls off as @xmath102 at large @xmath64 .",
    "note that in the erbl approach the cross section behaves @xmath103 .    as for the case of mesons",
    "one can show that due to the absence of @xmath104 states and @xmath55-spin symmetry there are only three independent flavor form factors for the ground state baryon channels for which one may take the ones for the proton - antiproton channel , @xmath105 .",
    "the quality of the present data @xcite necessitates a simplifying assumption @xmath106 which leads to @xmath107 with @xmath108 a fit to the data @xcite provides the results shown in fig.[fig : pp ] ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) .",
    "similar results are obtained for the @xmath111 channel .    due to time - reversal invariance",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the same up to a phase .",
    "this offers the opportunity for the fair project to study also handbag physics in the wide - angle region .",
    "in addition to @xmath113 one may study the photon - meson channels .",
    "their amplitudes are still under control of the basic form factors @xmath105 .",
    "thus , for instance , for the @xmath114 channel the annihilation form factors read @xcite ( @xmath115 ) @xmath116 with these form factors one finds good agreement with the fermilab data @xcite on @xmath117 .    finally , it should mentioned that the handbag approach to wide - angle scattering also applies to space - like processes .",
    "the gold - plated example is real compton scattering ( cf .  the remarks in sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) for which the gpds or respective form factors are known from an analysis of the nucleon form factors @xcite .",
    "the predictions for real compton scattering are in remarkable agreement with experiment .",
    "the basic ideas of the handbag approach for wide - angle scattering are reviewed and applications to several time - like processes such as two - photon annihilations into pairs of mesons or baryon - antibaryons , are discussed .",
    "it turns out that this approach seems to work quite well for energies larger than about 3 gev .",
    "data at higher energies are highly welcome in order to have a clean suppression of subleading terms . in",
    "the near future proton - antiproton annihilations into two photons or photon - meson can be measured at fair .",
    "such data in combination with @xmath118 measurements performed at belle ii would allow for a detailed investigation of the proton - antiproton distribution amplitudes .",
