    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) are seen in about 10 - 15% of optically - selected qsos , only among the radio - quiet ( rq ) qso population ( stocke et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the optical / uv spectra show deep , wide absorption troughs , displaced to the blue of their corresponding emission lines ( most often in the high ionization transitions of civ , siiv , nv , and ovi ) , which are suspected to result from a line of sight passing through highly ionized , high column density absorbing clouds outside the broad emission line region ( belr ) . these clouds flow outward from the nuclear region at speeds up to 0.1 - 0.2c .",
    "low bal cloud covering factors and the absence of emission lines at the high velocities observed in balqsos , along with the similarity of emission - line and continuum properties of bal and non - balqsos ( hamann , korista , & morris 1993 , weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) suggest that _ all _ rq qsos ( which in turn comprise @xmath3 of all qsos ) have bal clouds .",
    "thus balqsos are by no means exotic , but rather represent a privileged line of sight toward the agn nucleus that probes clouds that are very near , or cospatial with , the belr .",
    "the absorbing columns ( e.g. , @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) inferred for bal clouds from the ouv data ( hamann et al . 1993 , turnshek 1988 ) are such that _ a priori _ one expects very _ little _ soft x - ray absorption ( @xmath6 ) . however , green et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and green & mathur ( 1996 ; hereafter gm96 ) recently demonstrated that , when compared to normal rq qsos , balqsos are weak in the soft x - ray bandpass .",
    "if balqsos harbor normal intrinsic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , their soft x - ray weakness is most likely the result of absorption . although this remains to be proven for balqsos as a class , strong x - ray absorption of a normal powerlaw continuum is clearly observed in the asca spectrum of the prototype balqso phl5200 ( @xmath7 ; mathur , elvis , & singh 1995 ) .",
    "the green et al . ( 1995 ) sample of 36 balqsos was chosen from a large uniformly - selected qso sample ( the lbqs ) , as observed during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "although the short ( @xmath8  sec ) exposure times of the rass meant that the upper limits ( for 35 of the 36 qsos ) were not very sensitive , by stacking the x - ray data , they were able to show that their uniform balqso sample was x - ray quiet at the 99.5% significance level compared to carefully chosen comparison rq qso samples .",
    "then using deep pointed observations from the _ rosat _   pspc , gm96 confirmed that balqsos are weak in the soft x - ray bandpass in comparison to rq qsos with normal ouv spectra .",
    "nine out of twelve reputed balqsos in their sample were not detected by _",
    ", the deep pointings generally yielding @xmath0 .",
    "a comparison sample of 10 similar rq qsos ( from laor et al . 1994 ) without bals yielded a sample mean of @xmath9 . if indeed the central continuum source of balqsos is similar to that of other qsos , as argued above , the intrinsic absorbing columns required to explain the observed soft x - ray deficit ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) must be at least 100 times higher than those inferred from the uv data alone .",
    "in contrast , the non - bal sample shows no evidence at all for absorption . of the three remaining balqsos in gm96",
    ", 0312555 was too distant for an interesting lower limit to @xmath12 . in a 58ksec summed exposure , the balqso 1246057 was detected , yielding @xmath13 , and @xmath14@xmath11 .",
    "only one qso , pg1416129 , was x - ray bright , with a value of @xmath15 typical of non - balqsos .    that all balqsos but pg1416129 have large @xmath12 indeed suggests some physical connection between the uv and x - ray absorption , assuming similar intrinsic seds",
    "however , if pg1416129 is a _ bona fide _ balqso , although it would be uniquely well - suited for observational tests of absorber models , it would refute the hypothesis that highly ionized uv absorbers in balqsos are also responsible for their x - ray silence .",
    "if instead a high quality uv spectrum reveals only _ associated _ absorption ( narrow optical and ultraviolet absorption lines within the profiles of their broad emission lines ) , that model may stand .",
    "there are strong hints that a continuous distribution of uv / x - ray absorbing properties may exist between ` associated absorbers ' and bals ; pg1416129 might just be a missing link.    techniques have recently been developed that simultaneously exploit uv and x - ray spectra of qsos with narrower line , associated absorbers to constrain the allowed ranges of the absorbing cloud conditions through detailed photoionization modeling ( e.g. , 3c351 , 3c212 , ngc5548 , ngc3516 ; mathur 1994 , mathur et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "although these uv / x - ray techniques have shown that _",
    "consistent _ physical conditions for both the uv and soft x - ray absorbers can in many instances be derived , there is still debate on whether they are physically associated ( e.g. , kriss et al .",
    "1996a , b ) .",
    "an application of these techniques to balqsos may eventually provide stronger constraints on bal clouds , but the weakness of balqsos in the soft x - ray regime makes this a daunting task .",
    "if pg1416129 is a true balqso , its relative x - ray brightness and proximity to earth ( pg1416129 , at @xmath16 , has a redshift lower than any confirmed balqso ) would provide a uniquely accessible object for detailed x - ray / uv studies of high column density absorbers near the central engine of a qso . at the same time",
    ", pg1416129 provides a litmus test for the hypothesis that balqsos are x - ray quiet as a class .",
    "we were thus led to examine its uv spectrum more carefully , as described below : is pg1416129 a true balqso ?    0.2 cm",
    "the bal classification for pg1416129 was originally awarded by turnshek & grillmair ( 1986 ) , based on a single _ iue _ spectrum ( swp8916 ) , and propagated in a number of subsequent papers ( e.g. , ulrich 1988 , dekool & meurs 1994 , staubert , r. & maisack 1996 ) .",
    "that spectrum appears to show some evidence for what might be broad absorption in any of civ , siiv , or ly@xmath17 .",
    "blueward of civ in particular , there are possible absorption troughs that span @xmath18  km  s^-1@xmath19 , extending as far as about 20,000  km  s^-1@xmath19 from the line center .",
    "however , the combination of siiv broad emission , with a spurious flux spike near 1665 might merely combine to give that impression .",
    "in addition , a narrow absorption trough appears to bisect the civ emission just redward of the line core , but no similar absorption is seen in ly@xmath17 .",
    "since then , three other _ iue _ spectra have been obtained .",
    "a log of these observations is presented , along with continuum flux and @xmath20 measurements for the civ emission line , in table  [ tuv ] .",
    "we believe that none of these spectra show bals .",
    "neither does an average spectrum , whether weighted by signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) or not ( e.g. , see the optimally - extracted and co - added spectrum of pg1416@xmath21129 from lanzetta , turnshek , & sandoval 1993 ) .",
    "however , an snr - weighted sum of the _ iue _ spectra is dominated by swp33030 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which shows features blueward of civ that could only optimistically be interpreted as bals .",
    "an examination of reference spectra showing camera artifacts in _ iue _ swp spectra ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1990 ) is revealing .",
    "although the strengths , both relative and absolute , of camera artifacts can vary , the strongest spike for point sources is generally at 1663 , blueward of the civ emission line in pg1416129 .",
    "other spurious features , like those near 1700 probably contributed to the original bal classification",
    ".    the unusual ( and possibly variable ) nature of the putative bals in pg1416129 , together with its x - ray brightness , led us to seek another uv spectrum , this time using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "none of the artifacts just discussed are visible in our new hst spectrum , nor are any features reminiscent of bals .",
    "on ut 23 august 1996 , we obtained a 1-orbit ( 940sec ) spectrum of pg1416129 with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on the hubble space telescope , using a 0.43^@xmath22aperture and the g190h grating with the blue detector .",
    "we are aware of the scattered light problem in the fos when observing at the shortest wavelengths ( rosa 1994 ) . in our case",
    ", we would not expect a significant scattered light component because pg1416129 has a typical blue power - law continuum . nevertheless , it is prudent to make certain that the fos spectrum does not approach zero intensity bluewards of civ , as it appears to do in the spectrum of turnshek & grillmair ( 1986 ) .",
    "we used the bspec program ( rosa 1994 ) to simulate the scattered red light in the fos g190h bandpass .",
    "the input spectral energy distribution was derived from an optical spectrum of pg1416129 ( kindly provided by b. wilkes ) which covers the range 3200 - 6000 .",
    "we find a negligible contribution from scattered light .    the full spectrum , with a noise spectrum underlaid , is shown is figure  [ fullspec ] .",
    "given sufficient snr , the spectral resolution ( r @xmath23 2000 ) is adequate to measure narrow associated lines ( nals ) and to resolve some of the velocity structure of broad lines .",
    "the fos spectrum shows no evidence for absorption either narrow or broad . for narrow lines",
    ", we used the software described in aldcroft et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which iteratively fits for the quasar continuum + emission line profile , and searches for narrow absorption lines that are significant at 4-@xmath24 confidence . within 6000kms@xmath19 of the quasar civ emission line",
    ", the strongest observed absorption line has a rest equivalent width of 1.7 , while the detection limit is 2.3 . for broad lines , it is more difficult to establish formal detection criteria because the dominant uncertainty is determination of the quasar continuum and emission line profile . in the case of pg1416129 ,",
    "the fos spectrum is clearly consistent with no bals .",
    "the features which lent an impression of bals to the _ iue _ spectra are revealed to be noise spikes , when the civ region is contrasted between swp33030 and the fos spectrum in figure  [ fspikes ] .",
    "there appears to be significant uv variability in pg1416129 between the epochs of the observations presented here . during the fos and _ iue _ observations ( and from the _ iue _",
    "observing logs , and the line - by - line spectra ) the qso was always well centered in the aperture .",
    "we thus believe the changes in flux to be intrinsic to the qso , particularly because they are also accompanied by changes in emission line equivalent width .",
    "is pg1416129 unusually variable ?",
    "for comparison to published results from |iue spectra of a large sample of agn , we calculated the standard deviation in continuum flux @xmath25 for two 50 bins centered at ( rest ) wavelengths of @xmath26 and 1625 , as outlined in paltani & courvoisier ( 1994 ; pc94 ) ( see table  [ tuv ] )",
    ". the normalized variability index from @xmath27 epochs is calculated as    @xmath28    and yields 0.813 and 0.681 at 1450 and 1625 , respectively , using all 5 uv spectra of pg1416129 . at these wavelengths , the uv variability in rq qsos of similar luminosity to pg1416129 , as observed by _",
    "iue _ is typically about @xmath29 ( pc94 ) .",
    "pg1416129 thus appears to be unusually variable , similar to about 15% of agn that vary by more than 50% ( i.e. , @xmath30 ; pc94 ) .",
    "in addition to uv continuum variability , the civ emission line flux and @xmath20 also changed significantly .",
    "there is no significant trend with time for either line or continuum , and no correlation of continuum level with line @xmath20 ( i.e. , no baldwin effect ) .",
    "is it possible that true bals in pg1416129 weakened or disappeared ?",
    "absorption line variability has been seen both in narrower associated absorbers , and in balqsos ( koratkar et al . 1996 ; barlow 1994 ) .",
    "however , no published record exists of any absorption lines in balqsos completely disappearing .",
    "rather , bal variability is seen in about 15% of balqsos at the level of @xmath31 ( barlow 1994 ) .",
    "since bals span a wide range in velocity , most models of bal cloud outflows require either an ensemble of clouds along the line of sight , or winds blown off the surface of the accretion disk ( dekool & begelman 1995 ; murray & chiang 1995 ) . in either case , only small fractional changes in total absorption column are expected .",
    "thus , since no bals are presently seen in this qso , combined with the other evidence presented here , we conclude that there are not now , and never have been bals in pg1416129 .",
    "pg1416129 was strongly detected both by _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ in the soft x - ray bandpass , yielding consistent spectral fits typical of rq qsos .",
    "wilkes & elvis ( 1987 ) found a best fit powerlaw slope @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) with a neutral ( cold ) absorption column of @xmath34cm^-2@xmath35with the _ einstein _ ipc ( 0.3 - 3.5kev ) .",
    "a _ rosat _",
    "( 0.1 - 2.4  kev ) observation in 1992 january yielded similar spectral results ( @xmath36 ; dekool & meurs 1994 ) , again with a cold absorbing column ( @xmath37 cm^-2@xmath35 ) entirely consistent with the measured 21 cm galactic absorption . assuming a warm ( ionized ) absorber , the best fit spectrum yields @xmath38cm^-2@xmath35 .",
    "even this limit is far below those derived from deep _ rosat _ observations of _ bona fide _ balqsos presented in gm96 .",
    "earlier hard x - ray results from ginga ( 1988 february ) showed a very flat spectrum between 2 and 20  kev ( @xmath39 , williams et al .",
    "1992 ) , the hardest of all known agn .",
    "since the flux at the low end was well - matched to the later _ rosat _ fluxes , there was no evidence for variability .",
    "pg1416129 varied at energies from 50 - 150  kev during ( 1994 september ) osse observations ( staubert , r. & maisack 1996 ) .",
    "a powerlaw fit at these energies is considerably steeper ( @xmath40 ) than for most seyfert galaxies ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "if instead , the powerlaw slope is fixed at the ginga value ( whereby the normalization must have varied ) a good fit to the osse data requires an exponential cutoff of e - folding energy @xmath42  kev , similar to many seyfert galaxies .",
    "even though weakened soft x - ray emission suggestive of absorption is observed in every balqso to date , the exact physical relation between the uv and x - ray absorbers in balqsos is as yet unclear .",
    "it is thus not obvious whether large changes in bals would result in concomitant changes in the emergent soft x - ray flux or spectral shape .",
    "however , we would expect to see stronger changes in soft x - rays , if any , than at the osse range .",
    "pg1416 - 129 never showed any soft x - ray absorption , either before or after the _ iue _ observations .",
    "we therefore view substantial variation in the bals in this qso as an unlikely explanation of the apparent discrepancy between the _ iue _ and _ hst _ spectra .",
    "it is clear from recent hst fos spectra that pg1416129 currently shows no broad absorption lines . although there are some features resembling bals in the _ iue _ spectra , we argue for a variety of reasons that pg1416129 never exhibited bals",
    ".    from uv data , the _ iue _ spectra show spikes more consistent with recognized artifacts , noise and/or defects such as cosmic rays than with the smooth broad troughs normally seen in balqsos .",
    "these spikes vary rather conspicuously with time in the _ iue _ spectra , but are not visible in our new hst fos spectrum .",
    "furthermore , based on observations of other balqsos , it is not likely that there were true bals in pg1416129 that have since vanished .",
    "all soft x - ray observations of pg1416129 are consistent with no intrinsic absorption either cold or warm . furthermore , no substantial variability in either soft x - ray slope or normalization is observed , as might be expected if indeed an absorber showed substantial changes in column or ionization state .",
    "finally , we consider optical emission lines . from a 1990 optical spectrum ( boroson & green 1992 )",
    ", pg1416129 has somewhat weak feii@xmath43 emission and average /h@xmath44 , when compared to rq qsos of similar redshift .",
    "by contrast , balqsos typically have strong iron emission ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) , and small /h@xmath44 ( at least for low - ionization balqsos ; boroson & meyers 1992 ) .",
    "we also note from the _ iue _ spectra of pg1416129 that nv emission is virtually undetectable , even as an asymmetry in the ly@xmath17 profile , while junkkarinen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) suggest that nv in balqsos is marginally stronger than in non - balqsos . as a caveat ,",
    "some of these effects may depend on redshift and/or luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , since pg1416129 is the lowest redshift ( putative ) balqso , no comparison samples of balqsos at similarly low redshift and luminosity exist .",
    "although the _ hst _ spectrum alone shows definitively that pg1416129 has no uv bals , we take the _ iue _ , _ hst _ , x - ray and optical spectral evidence together to show that pg1416129 is not now , and has never been a _ bona fide _ balqso .",
    "gm96 compared their balqso sample to that of laor et al .",
    "1994 ( l94 ) , who derived a mean @xmath12 of @xmath45 for 10 rq qsos . by contrast , the balqsos in gm96 have a formal mean @xmath46 including pg1416129 . by removing pg1416129 from the balqso sample of gm96",
    ", we derive an overall sample mean @xmath12 of @xmath47 .",
    "note that this formal `` mean '' is derived via survival analysis , and includes only one detection , at @xmath48 .",
    "however , @xmath12 is known to depend on optical luminosity , and the balqso sample and the l94 samples samples have significantly different mean l_opt @xmath49 ( @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 in the log , respectively , with or without pg1416129 ) . from the general relationship between @xmath12 and l_opt @xmath49 ( wilkes et al .",
    "1994 , avni et al .",
    "1995 ) , the expected mean @xmath12 values for the balqso and l94 samples are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , based only their optical luminosities .",
    "a similarly significant ( @xmath54 ) difference between two samples of normal rq qsos at these luminosities is predicted by the relationship derived in green et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , from a large , complete , optically selected sample and different statistical techniques .",
    "the observed difference between the predicted mean value of @xmath12 of normal rq qsos at @xmath55 and that observed for balqsos is thus @xmath560.6 , about a @xmath57 disparity .",
    "pg1416129 might have been an outstanding exception that disproves the rule , if indeed it were a true balqso .",
    "an unabsorbed , x - ray bright balqso would be a direct challenge to some recent models that depict bals as absorption of the nuclear continuum by entrained winds off an accretion disk ( murray & chiang 1995 )",
    ". however , all _ bona fide _ balqsos have upon close examination been x - ray quiet , suggesting strong absorption in soft x - rays .",
    "conversely , as we demonstrate here for one important case , it appears that qsos with a normal ratio of optical to soft x - ray flux @xmath12 upon close examination will turn out _ not _ to be _ bona fide _ balqsos .",
    "weak soft x - ray emission is a defining characteristic of balqsos .",
    "the result that large @xmath12 is observed in balqsos for every case to date , together with the observation that intrinsic soft x - ray absorption is rare in optically - selected qsos ( e.g. , laor et al .",
    "1997 ) , suggests that the uv and soft x - ray absorbers have nearly the same covering factor and occupy the same solid angle as seen from the qso .",
    "this indicates that the uv and x - ray absorbers may be closely related , if not identical .",
    "we note that true variability has been detected in uv bal troughs : about 15% of balqsos show variability in the residual uv intensity ( rather than in the velocity structure ) at the @xmath58 level , indicating lower limits to column changes of about @xmath59cm^-2@xmath35 ( smith & penston 1988 , barlow et al .",
    "1992 , barlow 1994 ) .",
    "an ensuing change in the measured soft x - ray absorption , however , has not yet been observed .",
    "although we here rule out pg1416129 from consideration as a balqso , a demonstration of correlated variability between bals and soft x - ray flux would provide strong evidence that uv and soft x - ray absorbers are physically associated in true balqsos .",
    "such studies present a daunting task for the current generation of x - ray telescopes , given the weak soft x - ray fluxes of balqsos , but would be feasible with the larger effective areas of axaf , xmm , or future high throughput x - ray spectroscopy missions .",
    "these uv / x - ray variability studies could also determine whether bal variability is the result of a change in column density ( e.g. , due to motion of the absorber along the line of sight ) , or in ionization .",

    "<S> recent results from the _ rosat _ all sky survey , and from deep _ rosat _ pointings reveal that broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) are weak in the soft x - ray bandpass ( @xmath0 ) in comparison to qsos with normal ouv spectra ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
