    "while a non - zero neutrino mass is at the moment the only experimental evidence for physics beyond the standard model , as far as particle physics is concerned , in the domain of cosmology , several other oquestions remain unanswered within the standard model framework and also cry out for new physics .",
    "they are : ( @xmath1 ) particle physics candidates for dark matter , ( @xmath2 ) a deeper understanding of the mechanism of inflation @xcite , ( @xmath3 ) the nature of matter anti - matter asymmetry responsible for the observable universe@xcite as well as ( @xmath4 ) an explanation of dark energy .",
    "there are many interesting and compelling models of new physics that can explain the different cosmological phenomena listed above individually .",
    "however , it is always much more desirable that a single model explain more than one phenomenon ( ideally , of course , all of them ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss a model@xcite originally designed to explain neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism that seems to provide , after supersymmetrization , an explanation of both inflation and dark matter in a rather novel manner .",
    "the model has other desirable features such as gauge coupling unification , stable dark matter , stable proton due to r - parity conservation , etc .",
    "we use the supersymmetric singlet majoron @xcite model described in ref.@xcite where the seesaw mechanism@xcite for small neutrino masses is implemented by breaking a global @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the idea is to extend the standard model by the addition of one right handed neutrino per family and three standard model singlet superfields @xmath5 and @xmath6 . of the new higgs fields , @xmath7 has @xmath8 , @xmath9 has @xmath10 and @xmath6 has @xmath11 .",
    "the theoretical rationale for @xmath0 symmetry is rooted in the present neutrino oscillation results which require that the seesaw scale be much lower than the planck scale .",
    "it is therefore natural to think that it is protected by some symmetry . the simplest symmetry that does this is the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry could be a global or a local symmetry .",
    "if we take it to be a global symmetry , its spontaneous breaking leads to a nambu - goldstone boson , the majoron .",
    "since it is natural to expect that all global symmetries are broken by nonperturbative gravitational ( or stringy ) effects , we will parameterize these symmetry breaking effects by nonrenormalizable terms in the effective lagrangian which are suppressed by the planck scale @xmath12 . these planck scale @xmath0 breaking effects then give a tiny mass to the majoron@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that this model leads to : ( @xmath1 ) a picture of hybrid inflation of the universe that links the neutrino mass ( more precisly the seesaw or @xmath0 scale of order @xmath13 gev ) to inflation with all the desired features and ( @xmath2 ) planck scale @xmath0 breaking effects that lead to a mass for the majoron in the milli - electron volt range and make it a candidate for dark matter of the universe in the same way as the familiar axion , even though the parameters of the model are very different .",
    "it is , of course , interesting that this model ties the neutrino mass and the scale of inflation to the scale of gauge coupling unification .",
    "an interesting implication of the model is that it leads to a cosmologically induced lorentz violation for neutrinos .",
    "we also find that the superpartners of the majoron must be in the mev range in order to be compatible with the successes of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "as already noted , the supersymmetric singlet majoron model @xcite consists of the following superfields in addition to the well known quark , lepton , higgs and gauge fields of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) : a right handed neutrino field @xmath14 ( @xmath1 is the generation index ) , new higgs fields @xmath15 which carry lepton number @xmath16 and a singlet field @xmath7 , which is @xmath0 neutral .",
    "we will show below that this model with an appropriate choice of the superpotential given below leads to f - term inflation as well as to the majoron as the dark matter candidate .",
    "we require the renormalizable part of the theory to be invariant under global @xmath17 or an effective global symmetry which contains @xmath0 as a subgroup model like a supersymmetric model based on the gauge group @xmath18 and have local @xmath0 symmetry be broken by a multiplet ( @xmath19 ) with @xmath20 .",
    "the effective low energy theory in this case has a global u(1 ) symmetry which behaves like global @xmath0 .",
    "one can construct a d - term inflation@xcite model based on this model with a pair of @xmath9 and @xmath19 fields ( and their conjugates ) , if we choose a form for the superpotential @xmath21 and a fayet - illiopoulos term for the gauged @xmath17 .",
    "we do not elaborate on this model here .",
    "it has all the properties of the model presented here , with somewhat different parameters . ] .",
    "the superpotential for the model can be written as a sum of three terms : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the familiar superpotential for the mssm ; @xmath24 is the renormalizable part involving the new fields of the model and has the following form : @xmath25 we assume that nonperturbative planck scale effects induce nonrenormalizable terms in the potential and since we expect them to vanish in the limit of vanishing newton s constant , they should be suppressed by powers of @xmath12 .",
    "we arrange our theory such that the leading planck scale induced term has the form @xmath26 at the nonrenormalizable level , there are many terms that one could write but we find this to provide a good description of physics of interest here and such a form could be guaranteed by additional discrete symmetries .",
    "for instance a symmetry under which @xmath27 allows all the required terms for mssm except the @xmath28-term .",
    "we include the @xmath28-term in the superpotential since it is a lower dimensional term and it will break the symmetry softly .",
    "this superpotential leads to a potential involving the fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the following form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the supersymmetry breaking terms such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 etc . where these supersymmetry breaking mass parameters are all in the tev range .",
    "we have ignored the planck scale @xmath0 breaking terms since they are small and not relevant to the discussion of inflation given in the next section .",
    "the minimum of this potential corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "once the @xmath0 symmetry is broken , this leads to the seesaw mechanism for small neutrino masses .",
    "typically , a neutrino mass has the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is of the same order as a typical fermion mass of the standard model and @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "if we assume that the atmospheric neutrino oscillation is linked to the third generation quarks ( as would it be plausible in a quark - lepton symmetric theory ) , then the dirac mass would be about 100 gev and this would give @xmath40 gev , which is close to the value preferred by the inflation picture discussed below .    because the vevs of @xmath9 and @xmath30 break the global @xmath0 symmetry , in the absence of explicit @xmath0 breaking terms ( denoted by @xmath41 ) , we have a massless particle in the theory , the majoron , given by @xmath42 , where we have parameterized @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the potential for @xmath45 is flat due to the shift symmetry under which @xmath46 .",
    "once the planck scale terms are turned on , the potential @xmath47 loses its flatness and can generate a rolling behaviour for the @xmath45 field as we see below .",
    "this model has the ability to generate inflation in early stages of the universe .",
    "this comes about due to the interplay among the fields @xmath7 and @xmath9 and @xmath30 .",
    "the potential involving them is given by eq.(2 ) , which has the form required in the hybrid inflation scenario . to see this note that for , @xmath48 , the minimum of the potential corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that @xmath50 .",
    "the potential is then dominated by the term @xmath51 and the universe undergoes an inflationary phase .",
    "the @xmath7 field keeps rolling towards the potential minimum and inflation ends when the field @xmath7 reaches the value @xmath52 .",
    "however it is necessary for the potential to have small tilt to drive the field toward its global minimum .",
    "this is the hybrid inflation picture@xcite .",
    "one way to generate a slope along the inflationary trajectory ( i.e. the s direction ) is to include the one loop radiative correction to the tree level potential @xcite .",
    "this arises because supersymmetry is broken during inflation and there will be a mass splitting between the components in the chiral multiplet .",
    "the effective one loop radiative correction is @xmath53 where the sum extends over all the spin states @xmath54 with field dependent mass @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a renormalization scale .",
    "the @xmath57 term splits the components of the chiral multiplets @xmath9 and @xmath30 into a pair of two real scalar fields with masses @xmath58 and a dirac fermion with mass squared @xmath59 . since during the inflation @xmath60 ,",
    "the effective potential reads @xmath61 \\}\\ ] ] for @xmath7 much larger than the @xmath62 symmetry breaking scale the above potential becomes @xmath63 the log term will provide the driving force for the field @xmath7 to roll down the potential . in this case",
    "the slow roll parameters are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of e - foldings and is given by @xmath66 density perturbations in about @xmath67 e - foldings before the end of inflation are estimated as @xmath68 fluctuations with amplitude @xmath69 can obtained if @xmath70 .    another way to generate a slope to the potential is to add soft supersymmetry breaking mass @xmath71 to the inflaton field @xcite . in this case",
    "the slow roll parameters are given by @xmath72 the requirement that @xmath73 ( say @xmath74 ) gives @xmath75 in order for the soft supersymmetry breaking to dominate over the one loop radiative correction the parameter @xmath76 must be smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 after suffering @xmath78 e - foldings between the horizon exit and the the end of inflation is given by @xmath79 the @xmath9 field plays the role of the inflaton field , which then oscillates and reheats the universe via the production of neutrinos due to @xmath80 coupling .",
    "the density fluctuations lead to strong constraints on the parameters of the model and are given by : @xmath81 for @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 tev and @xmath84 we get @xmath85 .",
    "it is interesting that the value for @xmath86 required for understanding neutrino masses also gives the correct order of magnitude for density fluctuations generated by inflation .",
    "finally , we discuss the question of reheating after inflation ends .",
    "the reheating can be assumed to be caused by the decay of the field @xmath7 when it starts oscillating around the minimum .",
    "the reheating temperature is given by the approximate formula @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the decay width of the inflaton . to obtain the decay width of @xmath7",
    ", we have to isolate the decay modes .",
    "we expect that the @xmath76 coupling in the renormalizable part of the superpotential will give the dominant contribution to the decay width .    to see this in detail , note that if both @xmath9 and @xmath6 have equal vev that we are interested in .",
    "] , the combination @xmath89 is the fermionic partner of the majoron field ( denoted by @xmath45 ) and is therefore light whereas @xmath90 is the fermionic partner of the superheavy supermultiplet and therefore has same mass as @xmath7 field .",
    "however one can see from the superpotential that @xmath7 has a coupling to @xmath91 and can therefore decay to these states . the decay width",
    "is then given by @xmath92 .",
    "note that the inflaton gets its dominant mass from the @xmath0 breaking vev @xmath86 and a smaller mass from supersymmetry breaking.therefore @xmath93 .",
    "this leads to a reheating temperature of @xmath94 gev . in this case",
    "a gravitino with mass @xmath95 does not spoil the success of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the sugra embedding of this model os free of the @xmath96 problem that is generic to f - term sugra models@xcite .      in the presence of the nonrenormalizable terms",
    ", the majoron picks up a nonzero mass .",
    "if we choose the leading order non - renormalizable term to be @xmath97 ( which can be done by a judicious choice of discrete symmetries as discussed above ) , then we get the majoron mass @xmath98 .    in order to discuss how massive majorons constitute the dark matter of the universe , let us discuss the evolution of the majoron field @xmath45 as the universe evolves .",
    "the majoron potential , which arises solely from the @xmath0 breaking terms can be written using eq .",
    "( 3 ) in the form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "we have added a constant term , akin to a cosmological constant , so that after the amplitude for the @xmath45 field oscillation damps to its minimum at @xmath101 the value of the potential is zero .",
    "the field @xmath45 and the radiation energy density @xmath102 satisfy the coupled scalar field - einstein - friedman equations @xmath103 and @xmath104 \\label{hubble}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the early universe , clearly the @xmath105 term is negligible .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath106 is then dominated either by the kinetic energy of @xmath45 or the relativistic energy density in radiation .",
    "solving eq .",
    "[ phi ] , one finds that @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the scale factor .",
    "so regardless of whatever initial @xmath109 the field starts out with , it completely damps down to a very small value as the universe expands .",
    "thus the value of @xmath45 freezes over for most of the early universe at some random value .",
    "when @xmath110 , the potential term will dominate eq .",
    "( 16 ) and the field will oscillate around its minimum value of @xmath111 .",
    "these oscillations , which do not damp , behave like matter @xcite and contribute to the dark matter density .",
    "below , we calculate this contribution and find that for the range of parameters of interest , it gives the right order of magnitude for @xmath112 .",
    "as noted already , the value of the @xmath45 field remains frozen at its initial value ( taken to be @xmath86 ) until the epoch when @xmath113 at which time the @xmath45 field starts to oscillate .",
    "the temperature at which it does this is given by @xmath114 gev .",
    "as it oscillates , it is easy to show that it acts like a pressureless gas and thus can be treated as an ensemble of nonrelativistic particles@xcite .",
    "the contribution of the majoron to the energy density now is given by : @xmath115 the ratio of the majoron ( dark matter ) to the radiation energy density at their equipartition temperature @xmath116 ev is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 ev and @xmath119 ev@xmath120 are the temperature and the energy density of the photons today . for @xmath121 mev@xmath120 and @xmath122 mev one obtains @xmath123 .",
    "hence the universe remains radiation dominated until the temperature drops below @xmath124 ev .",
    "thus we see that majoron oscillations can act as a nonrelativistic dark matter with the right order of magnitude for @xmath112 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the same range of parameters that gave the neutrino mass values in the right order and also the density fluctuations required by cmb measurements also seems enable the majoron to play the role of dark matter .    to make these ideas concrete ,",
    "we have solved numerically the coupled equations ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ hubble ] ) in the regime prior to and after the majoron field begins oscillating .",
    "that is the region in which the hubble parameter , which includes the sum of radiation , matter and the majoron field energies , in the second term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , has decreased to the point that the right hand side has become appreciable in comparision with that term . for natural choices of the parameters discussed above ( @xmath86 and",
    "@xmath125 @xmath126 and 100 gev respectively ) the coefficient @xmath127 in the eq .",
    "( 15 ) becomes @xmath128 . in figures 1 and 2 ,",
    "we plot the solution for the majoron field @xmath45 for two initial @xmath45 values : @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we note that the amplitude of the final field oscillation is less in the second case . for still larger initial values of @xmath45 ,",
    "the amplitude falls off more sharply . on the other hand , both for smaller initial @xmath45 values and over a wide range of @xmath109 values , the final result for the majoron oscillation amplitudes are the same .    in figures 3 and 4",
    "we plot the resulting ratio @xmath131 for the same choice of parameters as in figures 1 and 2 respectively , over a broad region in which the oscillatory frequency is not too large compared to the expansion rate so that numerical computations with reasonable number of steps can be carried out and are reliable .",
    "one sees that this ratio increases linearly with decreasing temperature , as is appropriate for presureless matter .",
    "one can find today s value for @xmath131 simply by multiplying the values read - off the figure by @xmath132 .",
    "these numerical computations confirm that our parameter choice leads to the correct order of magnitude for today s ratio ( that is , oscillating @xmath45 field giving @xmath133 ) .",
    "finally we note that the frequency of the majoron field oscillation is given by @xmath134 .",
    "the oscillations begin around the epoch of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the energy in these oscillations around this epoch is very small compared to that in @xmath135 so that it does not affect the bbn considerations .",
    "furthermore it is worth noting that the frequency @xmath136 is independent of the value of @xmath86 .",
    "some consequences of the superlight majoron for cosmology has recently been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we consider other implications that particularly relate to the model in this paper in this section .      one important implication of our proposal is that it leads to a cosmologically induced violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "this comes about because in our model the majoron field has a derivative coupling of the form @xmath137 .",
    "in the late universe when @xmath138 , this leads to an effective lorentz violating term of the form @xmath139 in the effective low energy lagrangian .",
    "this effect is lorentz violating and will manifest itself in the neutrino oscillation process@xcite .",
    "the maximum value of the parameter @xmath140 in our model is @xmath141 gev .",
    "however since the lorentz violating term is family universal , it will most likely manifest irself in a transition from @xmath142 to @xmath143 .",
    "so the only way to detect this will be to measure @xmath144 . in the lorentz invariant case , such effects are generally suppressed by the mass of the neutrino@xcite and are therefore likely to be very small .",
    "the detailed experimental implications of such lorentz violating effects are currently under investigation .",
    "a second phanomenological implication is that if we ignore the supersymmetry breaking effects , then majoron belongs to a supermultiplet together with a scalar partner ( to be called smajoron ) and a fermion , majorino , both of which are massless . in the presence of supersymmetry",
    "breaking effects , the smajoron ( @xmath145 ) and majorino ( @xmath146 ) pick up mass in the mev to gev range .",
    "the precise values of these masses are however constrained by cosmological consideration for the model to be viable .",
    "we discuss them in this section .",
    "this question was discussed in @xcite for the case where the @xmath0 breaking scale is in the tev range .",
    "it was found that in that case the masses of @xmath145 and @xmath146 can be in the tev range .",
    "this holds as long as @xmath147 gev . in our case",
    "however @xmath148 gev . we will therefore end up with the smajoron ( @xmath145 ) and majorino ( @xmath146 ) masses in the 10 mev or lower range .",
    "the primary goal is to make sure that the new particles do not affect big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "since the couplings of the @xmath149 and @xmath146 to standard model particles are all suppressed by @xmath86 , the lifetimes of @xmath150 and @xmath146 are much longer than one second , the bbn epoch .",
    "therefore if they are heavy and their abundances at the bbn epoch are not suppressed , then they will have adverse effect on nucleosynthesis .",
    "we therefore have to calculate their abundance at the bbn epoch .",
    "due to the suppressed couplings of @xmath151 and @xmath146 , they will decouple in the very early stage of the universe . to calculate the decoupling temperature",
    ", we note that the typical annihilation rates are for @xmath151 and @xmath146 are given by @xmath152 . using the decoupling condition @xmath153",
    ", we get @xmath154 which leads to @xmath155 which is of order @xmath156 gev . after decoupling",
    "the @xmath151 and @xmath146 densities simply dilute due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "their contribution to the energy density of the universe at the bbn epoch is given by @xmath157 success of bbn requires that @xmath158 should be much less than one . since @xmath159",
    ", we therefore must have @xmath160 mev .",
    "finally , we wish to comment that in this model one can employ the mechanism of leptogenesis@xcite to understand the origin of matter in the universe .",
    "one can have a right handed neutrino@xcite at the intermediate scale range of @xmath162 gev range ( or even a pair of them nearly degenerate@xcite ) , whose decay would produce a lepton asymmetry , which via the sphaleron interactions would get converted to baryons .",
    "the only new aspect of our model is the presence of the majoron at very low energies . in principle",
    "its interactions can erase the baryon asymmetry since its interactions violate lepton number . however in our case since the scale @xmath86 is very high , as noted already , the majorons decouple around @xmath156 gev and are therefore `` impotent '' as far as their effect on lepton asymmetry is concerned .",
    "if for instance the @xmath86 scale was in the range below @xmath162 gev , we would have no leftover lepton asymmetry at the weak scale to be converted to baryons .",
    "it is therefore interesting that the high scale of @xmath86 is required from various considerations .    in conclusion , we have presented a simple model for neutrinos using the supersymmetric extension of the singlet majoron model that provides a unified framework for understanding inflation and dark matter for the same set of parameters required by neutrino masses .",
    "we find that the @xmath86 scale is constrained from various considerations to be around the conventional grand unification scale @xmath163 gev .",
    "we have checked our results using a numerical solution of the evolution equation for the majoron field .",
    "the high @xmath86 scale makes the majoron and its superpartners highly invisible in collider experiments .",
