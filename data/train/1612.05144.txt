    "cavity optomechanics , the field of physics studying the interactions of light confined in an optical cavity with the mechanical resonator forming the movable end of the cavity , is a very active area of research with many important applications @xcite .",
    "these include quantum information processing , for the interconversion between storage and communication qubits , high - precision measurements of tiny masses , displacements and forces , and fundamental tests of quantum physics at a macroscopic scale .",
    "one fascinating application is the creation of entanglement between the electromagnetic field trapped in the cavity and the motion of the macroscopic mechanical resonator .",
    "several theoretical works have suggested the creation of this optomechanical entanglement in the so - called _ steady state _ regime , see for example @xcite . in these and all the related studies , a continuous - wave light field is applied to the optomechanical system and drives it to a steady state , where the cavity filed and the mechanical motion of the oscillator are entangled .",
    "the major drawback of the steady state schemes is that the amount of generated entanglement is limited by the requirement of working in a stable stationary state . in order to overcome this limitation , an alternative _ pulsed _",
    "approach was suggested @xcite . according to this protocol",
    ", the entanglement is not created with the application of a continuous - wave field but with a light pulse , avoiding thus the limits imposed by stability requirements .",
    "this pulsed scheme was implemented experimentally for generating entanglement between mechanical motion and the microwave radiation field @xcite .    in the current paper",
    "we also consider a pulsed scheme , where the coupling strength between the cavity filed and the mechanical resonator is modulated in order to create the optomechanical entanglement .",
    "this is obviously different than the pulsed protocol discussed above .",
    "another important difference is that here we concentrate in the _ strong coupling _ regime , where the coupling strength is comparable or larger than the frequency of the mechanical oscillator , while the pulsed protocol @xcite focuses in the week coupling regime ( coupling much lower than the mechanical frequency ) , where the rotating wave approximation can be employed . an important consequence of working with large coupling is that a substantial amount of entanglement can be created within a fraction of the period of the mechanical motion .",
    "note that the pulsed modulation of the coupling has been mostly used for the numerical optimization of optomechanical cooling @xcite .",
    "recently , it was also employed to numerically investigate the fast entanglement creation between two oscillators ( for example two mechanical modes ) coupled via their interactions with a third oscillator ( optical mode ) @xcite .",
    "here we also formulate entanglement generation as an optimal control problem , but before recoursing to numerical optimization we use optimal control theory to draw as much information as possible for the optimal solution that maximizes entanglement .",
    "the present article is formulated as follows . in the next section we present some basic facts about optomechanical entanglement and",
    "identify the target state , while in section [ sec : problem ] we formulate entanglement generation as an optimal control problem in hyperbolic space @xmath0 . in section [ sec : solution ] we use optimal control theory to study the resultant problem and obtain the allowed optimal values of the coupling strength . in section [ sec : examples ] we use a numerical optimization method to find the exact optimal pulse sequences for some illustrative examples , while section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this work .",
    "in a laser driven optical cavity , the light from the laser entering the cavity is reflected between the mirrors and the enhanced electromagnetic field built inside the cavity exerts a force to the movable mirror due to radiation pressure . the interaction between the cavity ( photon ) field and the mechanical vibration of the mirror ( phonon field ) can be described by the following hamiltonian @xcite , sufficient for the study of many interesting phenomena in cavity optomechanics , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is planck s constant , @xmath3 is roughly the laser detuning from the cavity frequency and @xmath4 is the frequency of the mechanical resonator .",
    "the operators @xmath5 are the annihilation operators for the photon and the phonon fields , respectively , while @xmath6 are the corresponding creation operators .",
    "the first two terms in ( [ hamiltonianfull ] ) express the energy of each individual oscillator ( optical and mechanical ) , while the last term the interaction between them .",
    "the coupling rate @xmath7 has dimensions of frequency and is the available control which can be altered with time , with the aim to entangle the mechanical motion of the mirror with the cavity field ( optomechanical entanglement ) .",
    "the state of the system can be described by the density matrix @xmath8 , which satisfies the liouville - von neumann equation @xcite @xmath9.\\ ] ] note that here we consider only the coherent evolution and ignore relaxation , which describes the undesirable interaction of the system with its environment , since we are interested in the fast pulsed regime , where the evolution takes place within a fraction of a single oscillation period , and not the steady state regime .",
    "this is a legitimate practice in minimum - time quantum control problems @xcite , the alternative being to include relaxation and maximize the fidelity of the final point @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the so - called  blue - detuned regime \" @xmath10 , the case which is more relevant for entanglement generation as we immediately explain .",
    "observe that the interaction term in ( [ hamiltonianfull ] ) can be decomposed into two terms as follows @xmath11 the first term is suitable for optomechanical cooling and state swapping , while the second one for entanglement generation @xcite .",
    "for a blue - detuned laser , the second term is resonant with the cavity , and this is why we concentrate on this case for studying the generation of optomechanical entanglement .",
    "if we normalize time using the frequency @xmath4 , i.e. set @xmath12 , then the liouville - von neumann equation takes the following form , with @xmath13 @xmath14,\\;h=-\\hat{a}^+\\hat{a}+\\hat{b}^+\\hat{b}+g(t)(\\hat{a}^++\\hat{a})(\\hat{b}^++\\hat{b}).\\ ] ]    we consider that at @xmath15 the quantum system starts from the vacuum state @xmath16 is closely related to the well known two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xcite @xmath17 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "note that the above expansion in terms of the number states can be obtained following the procedure described in @xcite . before turning our attention to the target state that we actually consider in this article , we present some characteristics of state ( [ squeezed ] ) which we will need in the analysis that follows .    first of all note that , since ( [ squeezed ] ) is a pure state , its entanglement is quantified by the von neumann entropy of the reduced state @xcite @xmath18 where the probabilities @xmath19 are taken from the expansion ( [ squeezed ] ) and the final result is obtained by summing the series appropriately . if we set @xmath20 , then @xmath21 which is an increasing function of @xmath22 . but",
    "@xmath23 is also an increasing function for @xmath24 , thus the entanglement is an increasing function of the squeezing parameter @xmath25 .",
    "next , we specifically identify the quadratures which are squeezed . the annihilation operators @xmath26 of the two modes in state @xmath27 , which is related to the vacuum state by the unitary transformation given in ( [ squeezed ] ) , are    @xmath28    where the last terms in the above equations are obtained from the taylor expansion of the middle terms .",
    "now , if we denote the quadrature observables of a mode @xmath29 with @xmath30 and define @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are",
    "the quadrature observables corresponding to @xmath26 , respectively , then it is not hard to verify that @xmath34 from the last relation we find    @xmath35=\\frac{e^{-2r}}{2},\\\\ \\label{variancep}\\langle\\delta(\\hat{\\mathcal{p}}^{\\phi})^2\\rangle & = \\frac{e^{-2r}}{2}[\\delta\\hat{p}_a^2+\\delta\\hat{p}_b^2]=\\frac{e^{-2r}}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath36 in the vacuum state . thus , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are squeezed , while note that @xmath39=0,\\ ] ] and this is why we used the calligraphic symbol in @xmath38 .    as we explain in the next section , state ( [ squeezed ] )",
    "can not be generated from the initial vacuum state under evolution ( [ liouville ] ) , in the blue - detuned regime .",
    "for this reason , we consider the following modified target state at the final time @xmath40 @xmath41 of the two modes in state @xmath42 are    @xmath43    where the last terms in the above equations are obtained from the taylor expansion of the middle terms . if we define @xmath44 where @xmath45 are given by ( [ quadratures ] ) for @xmath46 , then it is not hard to verify , using ( [ apsi ] ) , ( [ bpsi ] ) and ( [ quadraturesphi ] ) , that @xmath47 thus @xmath48=\\frac{e^{-2r}}{2}\\ ] ] and @xmath49=0,\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ variancex ] ) , ( [ variancep ] ) and ( [ commutatorphi ] ) . in the target state ( [ target ] ) the squeezed quadratures are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , defined in ( [ squeezedquadrature ] ) .    in order to motivate",
    "why we would like to generate such a state , we close this section by briefly reminding its role in the optomechanical teleportation protocol @xcite . according to this protocol",
    ", a first light pulse is entangled with the mechanical motion of the mirror forming state @xmath42 given in ( [ target ] ) , while a second light pulse , prepared in the state @xmath52 which will be teleported , interacts with the first pulse in a beam splitter .",
    "two homodyne detectors at the output ports of the beam splitter measure the quadratures @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "subsequently , the mirror is displaced in position and momentum by the outcome of these measurements .",
    "this feedback brings the mirror to a state @xmath55 , with position and momentum given by @xmath56 for large values of the squuzing parameter @xmath57 the terms proportional to @xmath58 are suppressed and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , in other words the state @xmath52 is teleported to the mirror .",
    "for the evolution described by ( [ liouville ] ) , a closed set of equations can be obtained for the second moments of the creation and annihilation operators of the two resonators , for example @xmath61 etc . , see @xcite .",
    "in order to formulate entanglement generation as a control problem , we do not follow the standard approach to use directly the moment operators @xcite , but rather use specific linear combinations of them , a set of ten operators which are the generators of the symplectic group @xmath62 @xcite , introduced by dirac @xcite",

    "can be written as @xmath73.\\ ] ] the expectation value of an operator @xmath74 is @xmath75 and , using expression ( [ hamiltonianfinal ] ) for the hamiltonian in the liouville - von neumann equation ( [ liouville ] ) and the commutation relations ( [ commutators ] ) , we obtain the following systems for the expectation values of the above operators @xmath76 @xmath77    we next move to express the initial and target states of the above systems . recall that we start from the vacuum state ( [ initial ] ) , thus the corresponding initial conditions for the expectation values of the operators defined in ( [ operators ] ) are @xmath78the target entangled state is ( [ target ] ) and using ( [ apsi ] ) , ( [ bpsi ] ) and ( [ aphi ] ) , ( [ bphi ] ) we find the following expectation values of operators ( [ operators ] ) in this state @xmath79    now observe from ( [ initial_conditions_b ] ) that the initial values of @xmath80 are zero . system ( [ 6d ] ) is linear in these variables and homogeneous , thus these expectation values remain zero during the whole time evolution .",
    "consequently , when starting from the vacuum state , the generation of the target entangled state is solely described by system ( [ 4d ] ) . if we normalize the expectation values @xmath81 with @xmath82 , but keep the same notation for these variables , then system ( [ 4d ] ) remains unchanged , while the starting and target points become @xmath83using the initial condition ( [ start ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 4d ] ) we find that the system variables satisfy @xmath84 which is the equation of a hyperboloid of two sheets .",
    "but from the definition of @xmath85 in ( [ operators ] ) it is obviously @xmath86 , thus system ( [ 4d ] ) actually evolves in the upper sheet , the hyperbolic space @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this space is closely related to the minkowski space .",
    "we use the usual notation for contravariant and covariant four - vectors @xmath87and for the scalar product between two four - vectors @xmath88 @xmath89 where the einstein summation convention over repeated indices is assumed .",
    "the geodesic distance @xmath90 between two points in the space , represented by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , is given by @xmath93 where note that for points in @xmath0 it can be shown that it is always @xmath94 thus the geodesic distance is well defined .",
    "for the initial vacuum state ( [ start ] ) and the final squeezed state ( [ end ] ) we have @xmath95 and from ( [ spacelike ] ) we find the geodesic distance to be @xmath96 twice the squeezing parameter , an aesthetically pleasant expression .",
    "up to now we have implicitly assumed that the value of the squeezing parameter @xmath25 at the final state is given .",
    "in such a case , a meaningful question to ask is how should we pick the time - varying coupling @xmath97 , which is bounded due to experimental limitations as below @xmath98 in order to reach the target point in minimum time @xmath99 .",
    "although in the subsequent sections we do not actually study this minimum - time problem but a closely related one , here we make some simple observations about it .",
    "first of all note that , since the dynamics are governed by system ( [ 4d ] ) , which imposes certain restrictions on the allowed paths and speed , the path corresponding to the shortest geodesic distance may not be permitted or may not be the fastest . next , consider the quantity @xmath100 with some algebra we can show that @xmath101 for points in @xmath0 , and note that there is no contradiction with ( [ product_range ] ) , since @xmath102 belongs to the tangent space of @xmath0 . since the quantity @xmath103 actually corresponds to the speed in the flat @xmath104 minkowski space with metric tensor @xmath105 , where @xmath0 is embedded , it is in principle desirable to move along paths where this quantity is maximized .",
    "but from ( [ speed ] ) observe that @xmath106 is actually a quadratic function of the control @xmath97 , with the coefficient of @xmath107 being positive @xmath108 since @xmath109 would imply in ( [ hyperbolic ] ) @xmath110 , which is obviously not true .",
    "thus the instantaneous speed @xmath106 is a convex function of the coupling , which is restricted as in ( [ bound ] ) , and is maximized when @xmath97 takes values at the boundaries @xmath111 .",
    "note of course that , since the choice of @xmath97 also affects the path travelled , there might be cases where the minimum - time path is not the one along which the speed is maximized .    inspired from the above analysis and the well known fact that optomechanical state swap can be achieved for specific constant values of the coupling rate and the duration @xmath99 @xcite , it is tempting to examine whether a constant coupling @xmath112 can transfer the system to the desired target state .",
    "we show that , unfortunately , this is not the case for squeezing .",
    "it can be verified using the system equation ( [ 4d ] ) that for _ constant _ @xmath97 the quantity @xmath106 given in ( [ speed ] ) is also constant . but using the initial and final conditions ( [ start ] ) and ( [ end ] ) we obtain @xmath113 where the equality holds only for @xmath114 .",
    "the conclusion is that in order to reach the target state the coupling has to change in time .",
    "the problem that we actually study in the rest of the paper is closely related to the minimum - time problem stated above .",
    "specifically , we fix the duration @xmath99 and ask what is the maximum value of the squeezing parameter , corresponding to the maximum entanglement , which can be obtained at the final time @xmath40 . in order to precisely formulate this problem and also reduce the dimension of the system from four to three , we use the constant of the motion ( [ hyperbolic ] ) . recall that @xmath86 , thus @xmath115 using this relation we end up with the three - dimensional system    @xmath116    starting from @xmath117 we would like to find the time - varying control @xmath97 , bounded as in ( [ bound ] ) , which minimizes @xmath118 while it drives the other two state variables to the final conditions @xmath119 note that , since @xmath120 , its minimization corresponds to maximizing the squeezing parameter @xmath25 and the entanglement .",
    "we finally show that for two durations @xmath121 , with @xmath122 , the corresponding minimum values of @xmath123 satisfy @xmath124 , i.e. the minimum value of @xmath123 is a nonincreasing function of the final time , thus the squeezing parameter and the entanglement are nondecreasing functions of it . indeed , if @xmath97 is the optimal control for @xmath125 , which drives the system at the point @xmath126 , then the control @xmath127 drives the system at the same point at the final time @xmath128 .",
    "thus , for the larger duration @xmath129 we can obtain at least the value @xmath118 , corresponding to the minimum for the smaller duration @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , the minimum corresponding to @xmath129 satisfies @xmath124 .",
    "this monotonic behavior of the objective function indicates the dual character of our maximum - entanglement problem and the minimum - time problem stated above . if we solve a series of maximum - entanglement problems for increasing duration @xmath99 , then the solution of the minimum - time problem is the shortest time for which the desired level of entanglement is obtained",
    "in this section we use optimal control theory @xcite to obtain some characteristics of the optimal solution for the maximum - entanglement problem .",
    "the control hamiltonian for this problem is defined as @xmath130 where the costates",
    "@xmath131 satisfy the equations    @xmath132.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since we want to minimize @xmath118 , the following terminal condition should be satisfied by the corresponding costate @xcite @xmath133    according to pontryagin s minimum principle , the optimal control @xmath97 is chosen such that the control hamiltonian is minimized for @xmath125 .",
    "but the control appears only linearly in @xmath134 , while it is bounded as in ( [ bound ] ) , thus the optimal choice of @xmath135 depends on the sign of the quantity which multiplies it in ( [ control_hamiltonian ] ) , the so - called _ switching function _",
    "@xmath136 specifically , the optimal control is @xmath137 observe that when the switching function is nonzero , the optimal control takes the corresponding boundary value which minimizes @xmath134 and we call this a _ bang _ pulse . when the switching function is zero during a time interval of nonzero measure , the control is called _ singular _ and is calculated using the derivatives of @xmath138 , as we demonstrate in the next paragraph .    during a time interval where the control is singular ,",
    "the switching function and its time derivatives are zero @xmath139 for the problem at hand we find , using the system and costate differential equations    @xmath140    now observe that the costates @xmath141 can not be simultaneously zero at any moment , since in such case the linear homogeneous system of first order differential equations ( [ lambda1])-([lambda3 ] ) for the costates would imply @xmath142 for @xmath125 , violating the terminal condition ( [ lambda1_terminal ] ) .",
    "this non - triviality of the costates requires the determinant corresponding to the linear homogeneous system ( [ fi])-([fiddot ] ) to be zero , which leads to the condition @xmath143 when the control is singular , the system evolves in the above surface , which is called _ singular surface_. on this surface it is also @xmath144 , and from system equation ( [ q1 ] ) we find @xmath145 , since obviously @xmath146 .",
    "thus , the singular control is @xmath147 from the system equations it is obvious that a singular trajectory corresponds to a rotation around @xmath123-axis on the plane @xmath148 .",
    "note that pontryagin s minimum principle provides necessary conditions for optimality . in the case of singular control",
    ", there is an additional necessary condition , the so - called generalized legendre - clebsch condition @xcite . for the minimization problem at hand it takes the form @xmath149\\geq",
    "0\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{kelley}\\rightarrow & \\lambda_2\\left(q_3-\\sqrt{1+q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2+q_3 ^ 2}\\right)-\\lambda_3q_2\\leq 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will use this condition in the next section as an extra test of optimality .",
    "we close this section by observing that , although we have identified the possible values of the optimal control , finding the exact pulse sequence is a difficult problem which depends on the duration @xmath99 and the control bound @xmath150 . for this reason , in the next section we recourse to numerical optimization in order to obtain the optimal pulse sequences for specific values of these parameters . but before doing so , here we exclude certain pulse sequences and this will lead us to the most frequently encountered optimal control profiles .",
    "first of all , recall that in the previous section we showed that a simple constant pulse can not drive the system to a final state of the desired form .",
    "next , observe that a bang - singular pulse sequence is forbidden because the initial bang pulse can not reach the singular surface ( [ surface ] ) , since during this pulse @xmath151 has constant sign , from ( [ q1 ] ) with @xmath152 , while @xmath153 .",
    "the sequence singular - bang is equivalent to a simple bang pulse , since the singular control is @xmath154 and the system remains at the starting point ( the origin ) during this part , thus it is also excluded .",
    "we examine next a bang - bang sequence , composed by two bang pulses ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "observe that , when the duration @xmath99 is fixed , there is only one free parameter , the duration of one of the pulses , while there are two final conditions ( [ finalq ] ) to be satisfied .",
    "thus , such a pulse sequence can not in general be optimal and this may happen only for certain values of @xmath99 and @xmath150 . in order to satisfy the two final conditions ( [ finalq ] ) , a sequence of at least three pulses is necessary , where the durations of the first two can be taken as free parameters for fixed @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , in the next section we present a numerical example where the optimal control is a bang - bang - bang sequence . sequences of the form bang - bang - singular , singular - bang - bang and bang - singular - bang can be excluded using similar reasoning as above . the simplest pulse sequence containing a singular arc has the form bang - bang - singular - bang and this is the optimal pulse sequence that we encountered in most of our simulations .",
    "in this section , we use the freely available optimal control solver bocop @xcite to obtain numerically the optimal solutions for several illustrative examples . in the bocop software package ,",
    "the continuous - time optimal control problem is approximated by a finite - dimensional optimization problem , using time discretization .",
    "the resultant nonlinear programming problem is subsequently solved using the nonlinear solver ipopt .
