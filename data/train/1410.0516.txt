    "landau - zener ( lz ) transitions occur when two energy levels cross , or more accurately experience an avoided crossing , as some external parameter is varied in time @xcite .",
    "the system can then either stay in the same energy level that it occupied before the crossing , or it can undergo a transition to the other level .",
    "such a universal phenomenon is ubiquitous and has applications in various areas of quantum physics . among the new areas where the physics of lz transitions can play an important role are adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite and amplitude spectroscopy in nanoscale circuits @xcite and in nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond @xcite .",
    "it could also play a role in the inter - molecular energy transfer in biological light - harvesting systems . in aqc ,",
    "the parameters of a physical system ( which can be called a quantum computer or annealer ) are varied slowly such that the system transforms from an easy - to - prepare ground state into a ground state that contains the answer to a physical problem ( or even a computational problem of non - physical nature ) . in biological light - harvesting systems ,",
    "energy transfer between different parts of a molecule could be governed by molecular changes that act as driving fields for electronic motion .",
    "the lz problem in a closed system was solved soon after it was formulated over eighty years ago @xcite .",
    "physical systems , however , invariably interact with a surrounding environment .",
    "there have been numerous studies on the lz problem in the presence of an environment @xcite , and some methods have produced accurate results in their regimes of validity . however , there is no method that is valid and computationally efficient for all parameter regimes .",
    "in particular , the different methods typically have underlying assumptions justifying the validity of their mathematical formulation based on physical arguments .",
    "for example , one could make the assumption of a very short correlation or memory time in the environment s degrees of freedom and use a markovian approach .",
    "this approach would , however , break down when the environment s correlation time is not short compared to the lz timescale , a situation that could occur when dealing with low - frequency noise .    here",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we numerically solve a rather simple physical problem that involves a single two - level system ( to which we also refer as the qubit ) coupled to a single harmonic oscillator .",
    "we can therefore be confident that our numerical calculations provide an accurate description of the problem as formulated .",
    "after obtaining the numerical results for the relatively simple problem , we comment on the physical significance of these results and how they could apply for a system where the single harmonic oscillator is replaced by an environment with a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] we describe the basic setup and introduce the corresponding hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numericalcalculations ] we describe our numerical calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of these calculations and discuss the interpretation of the results . section [ sec : conclusion ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the basic lz problem where the system of interest possesses only two quantum states . as such",
    ", it can be described using the pauli matrices @xmath0 with @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "we use the basis states defined by the relations @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in an isolated system ,",
    "the lz hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 where the time variable @xmath6 goes from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the sweep rate and @xmath10 is the minimum energy gap between the ground and excited states , which occurs at @xmath11 . at large negative times the ground and excited states",
    "asymptotically coincide with the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the roles of these states are reversed at large positive times . at @xmath11 ,",
    "the instantaneous ground and excited states are equal superpositions of the states @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "the lz formula , which for example gives the probability for a system prepared in its ground state at @xmath14 to end up in the excited state at @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , for a slow sweep ( i.e.  @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 and a system that is initially prepared in the ground state has a high probability of remaining in the ground state .",
    "the lz problem can be generalized in order to take into account the effects of an uncontrolled external environment .",
    "early studies on this problem used somewhat ad hoc quantum master equations in order to incorporate dissipative processes in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies generally started with a specific model of the environment and derived approximate equations of motion for the system under certain approximations ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "because of computational convenience and physical relevance , the environment is commonly modeled as a large set of harmonic oscillators , even if the microscopic details of the environment are not known .",
    "this approach has been applied successfully to the study of the lz problem in a number of regimes .",
    "it is not possible , however , to obtain analytic results for this problem , and approximations that are valid for specific regimes are commonly made in order to numerically calculate the effect of the large number of harmonic oscillators on the lz probability .",
    "the strong - coupling and low - temperature regimes are particularly challenging for these methods .    here",
    "we take a different approach to studying the effects of the environment on the lz problem .",
    "we consider an environment composed of a single harmonic oscillator .",
    "clearly this simple model will not be able to capture all the effects that occur in a complex environment .",
    "however , the simplicity of the model allows us to have confidence in the results of standard numerical simulations . rather than having to make assumptions concerning the behaviour of the system at the beginning of the calculation , the difficult task",
    "is then shifted to the step of interpreting the numerical results and identifying in these results patterns and tendencies that one can expect to apply for a large environment .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that there can be cases where the largest environmental effects are caused by a single mode in the environment , in which case the results of this simple model become particularly relevant .",
    "another advantage of treating such a minimal model is the fact that it allows us to discuss physical processes rather clearly .",
    "we would like to note here that a related system , namely an lz problem of a qubit coupled to a harmonic oscillator and an environment , was recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    ", however , there is no minimum - gap term in the qubit s hamiltonian , and the avoided crossings arise as a result of the coupling between the qubit and the oscillator , rendering the system qualitatively different from the one that we consider in this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian of the lz problem with a single - mode environment and linear coupling is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the characteristic frequency of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the oscillator s annihilation and creation operators , and @xmath23 is the qubit - oscillator coupling strength .",
    "the energy level diagram of this problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyleveldiagram ] .",
    "we are interested in particular in the case of slow , nearly adiabatic passage .",
    "this case corresponds to the desired condition for obtaining a high transfer probability in adiabatic passage protocols ; it is also the relevant regime for maximizing the success probability in an adiabatic quantum computation .",
    "we numerically solve the time - dependent schrdinger ( or liouville - von neumann ) equation using the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lzhamiltoniansingleenvironmentmode ] ) . in these calculations",
    "we set the sweep rate @xmath9 to the value that gives @xmath24 ( i.e. , starting from the ground state , the two - level system ends up in the ground state with 90% probability ) .",
    "in other words , we choose a sweep rate that is close to the adiabatic limit in the absence of the coupling to the oscillator .",
    "we take three different values for the oscillator frequency : @xmath25 ( low - frequency oscillator ) , 1 ( intermediate regime ) , and 5 ( high - frequency oscillator ) .",
    "we vary the coupling strength from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and we vary the temperature @xmath28 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant .    in order to incorporate the finite temperature into the calculation ,",
    "the simulations are started in thermal equilibrium at a large negative value for the time variable . in this limit , the qubit and resonator are effectively decoupled from each other , except for simple mean - field shifts that they induce on each other .",
    "furthermore , the qubit s energy splitting is very large in the limit @xmath14 . as a result ,",
    "the qubit starts initially in its ground state @xmath12 .",
    "the harmonic oscillator starts in a mixed thermal state according to the boltzmann probability distribution with an average number of quanta @xmath32 for high temperatures ( note that the boltzmann probability distribution extends up to several times this value ) .",
    "this estimate provides a minimum number of basis states that need to be included in the simulations , and it also sets a limit to the highest temperatures that can be reached in simulations with a given size of the hilbert space .",
    "in particular for the lowest oscillator frequency and highest temperature that we consider , we use a hilbert space with 1000 basis states .",
    "note that the initial state of the oscillator is the only part of the calculation where the finite temperature of the environment enters the calculation .",
    "after setting the initial state according to the boltzmann distribution , we evolve the density matrix of the combined system in time according to the schrdinger equation . note that this evolution is unitary , which is the reason why we can say that , in contrast to most other methods , we do not make any approximations or assumptions concerning the internal dynamics of the environment .",
    "the evolution is stopped at a sufficiently large and positive value of the time variable , such that further evolution would not have any noticeable effect on the occupation probabilities of the different states . at this final time",
    ", we examine the occupation probabilities of the different quantum states , from which we can easily calculate the probability that the qubit remains in its ground state .     as a function of temperature @xmath33 and coupling strength @xmath23 , both measured relative to the qubit s minimum gap @xmath10 .",

    "( note here that when we replace the isolated qubit with the coupled qubit - oscillator system the single avoided crossing is replaced by a complex network of avoided crossings . ) under this approximation , we only need to calculate the occupation probabilities of the different states , and these probabilities change ( according to the lz formula ) only at the points of avoided crossing .",
    "this approach greatly simplifies the numerical calculations because the locations and gaps for the different avoided crossings can be determined easily ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : energyleveldiagram ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitationprobabilityfromincoherentcalculation ] .",
    "the results of this calculation agree generally well with those obtained by solving the schrdinger equation when @xmath38 . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the semiclassical calculation consistently underestimates the excited - state probability , but the overall dependence on temperature and coupling strength is remarkably similar to that shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : excitationprobability50 ] . we should note that higher values of @xmath55 ( not shown ) exhibit more pronounced deviations , with side peaks appearing in the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath36 .",
    "the most striking deviation from the results of the fully quantum calculation is seen in the case @xmath37 ( i.e.  the case of a low - frequency oscillator ) . in the semiclassical calculation , there is a rather high peak at a small value of the coupling strength ( and sufficiently high temperatures ) , and the excited - state probability starts decreasing when the coupling strength @xmath23 becomes larger than @xmath55 . in the fully quantum calculation , however , the peak is located at a much higher value , somewhere between 0.5 and 1 depending on the temperature .    the fact that the semiclassical calculation generally gives results different from those given by the fully quantum calculation is an indication that quantum coherence and interference between multiple lz processes play a role in determining the final occupation probabilities . in this context",
    "we note that the avoided crossings occur at instances separated by time intervals @xmath56 ( with an infinite number of avoided crossings occurring simultaneously at each one of these instances ) , and the time duration over which an lz mixing process occurs ( in the almost - adiabatic regime ) is given by @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the ratio between these two time scales is then given by @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , when @xmath40 is small the different lz processes will overlap in time , and it is not too surprising that the semiclassical calculation gives incorrect predictions in this case .",
    "it is somewhat surprising , however , that when @xmath38 the two calculations agree quite well and then in the regime @xmath59 the effect of quantum interference between the lz processes can again be seen in the final occupation probabilities .",
    "we now take another look at our results presented above from the point of view of how they might apply in the case of a large environment containing a large number of degrees of freedom with no single dominant environmental mode .",
    "note here that the coupling between the qubit and the environment can in principle be strong , even if the coupling to each individual mode in the environment is weak .",
    "we first consider our results in the regime of strong qubit - environment coupling . we have found that strong coupling to a single mode results in a reduced effect of that mode on the final occupation probabilities .",
    "it is unlikely that this result will apply to the case where the qubit is coupled strongly to an uncontrolled environment containing a large number of independent modes with the coupling to each individual mode in the environment being weak .",
    "the weakening of the environmental effects with increased coupling strength in the case of a single mode is most likely related to the energy level structure and the possible paths that the system can follow while it traverses the network of avoided crossings .",
    "the energy level structure and the possible paths are vastly different when the strong coupling to the environment is caused by the large number of modes in the environment",
    ". it would be more plausible that in this case one can make statements concerning large environments using the following approach : focus on the small @xmath36 region of the results discussed above , take the contributions of the individual environment modes and add up these small contributions . in this case",
    "an increase in coupling strength would result in an increase in the excited state probability , as would be intuitively expected .",
    "we therefore expect that the result of non - monotonic behaviour with increasing coupling strength should be thought of as a result pertaining to the case with a single dominant mode in the environment .",
    "another area where we can try to extract from our results statements concerning a large environment occurs in the regime of low temperatures , which can be particularly relevant in the context of aqc . as a side note ,",
    "we mention here that one of the central questions in the field of aqc is the scaling of the minimum gap with system size .",
    "it is known that the minimum gap decreases with increasing system size , and there are ongoing studies on the exact scaling law .",
    "this minimum - gap scaling is typically discussed in relation to the time needed to ensure adiabatic evolution of the quantum annealer , and the minimum running time is calculated based on the well - known lz formula given in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] .",
    "an independent question is the resistance of the aqc success probability to environmental noise .",
    "the facts that at finite temperatures the excitation probability increases above the base value @xmath47 and that the excitation probability can be substantially larger than @xmath47 even at temperatures much lower than the minimum gap mean that the coupling to the low - frequency modes in the environment needs to be considered with extra care in the low - temperature regime . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we discussed the scaling of the noise amplitude with system size , with the main message being that the noise amplitude increases with increasing system size .",
    "the present work complements our earlier work in that it provides a quantitative analysis of the effect of the environment on a system driven using an adiabatic passage protocol , as is the case in aqc .",
    "we have investigated the problem of a two - level system undergoing an lz passage through an avoided crossing while it interacts with a finite - temperature harmonic oscillator .",
    "we have found a number of counter - intuitive results , including non - monotonic dependence of the final - time excitation probability as a function of temperature or qubit - oscillator coupling strength . we have provided physical explanations for these phenomena .",
    "the physical mechanisms at play include modifications to the avoided crossing structure related to the formation of highly correlated energy eigenstates as well as quantum coherence between multiple lz processes .",
    "our original motivation for analyzing a system with a single qubit and a single additional degree of freedom was to use the obtained results in order to make statements relevant for a large environment , and we have indeed attempted to make such an extrapolation of results .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our results are of interest even in relation to the single - oscillator case , both because they pertain to a model system that allows a clear discussion of the physical mechanisms involved and because certain systems in nature are accurately described by the model of a single qubit coupled to a single oscillator .",
    "in other words , in addition to the general principles that we have deduced concerning general environments , our results can have direct applicability to qubit - oscillator systems such as cavity electrodynamics or some molecular systems .",
