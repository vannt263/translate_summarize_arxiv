    "the wavelength splitting between bonded and anti - bonded modes is measured to be @xmath161  nm .",
    "such a splitting indicates a nanobeam gap of roughly @xmath162  nm , consistent with the sem images of the fabricated devices .",
    "[ fig_qd_spectra](b ) shows both bonded and anti - bonded modes at very low average pump power ( @xmath163  ns , @xmath164s , @xmath165  nw ) . at this power level , and for the single layer of quantum dots in these devices , the expected enhancement / reduction to the pumped cavity @xmath13-factor is negligible . from the linewidth of the modes",
    ", we estimate the quality factor of the bonded mode in these devices to be around @xmath166 .",
    "although not large enough to achieve lasing in this qd material ( a @xmath13-factor of greater than @xmath167 is required to reach threshold given the limited qd gain ) , these results are encouraging given the much more substantial gain attainable in quantum well material@xcite .    .",

    "in the work presented here , highly dispersive zipper optomechanical cavities have been proposed and designed for tunable on - chip semiconductor lasers . two master - slave schemes for wavelength tuning have been proposed .",
    "the first , all - optical , allows for tuning using a higher order zipper mode .",
    "the second , electrical - optical , allows for tuning via a capacitively actuated mems structure integrated into the zipper cavity structure .",
    "both schemes take advantage of the very large @xmath168 values unique to the zipper cavity geometry .",
    "tuning range is related to initial nanobeam separation , mechanical spring constant , the force delivered by the master , and geometric limitations .",
    "the high mechanical compliance of these structures , i.e. low static spring constant , makes them susceptible to thermal and therefore frequency noise . in some cases",
    "the susceptibility to frequency noise can be mediated by the dynamic backaction of the control optical ( electrical ) field and its contribution to a dynamic spring constant .    in the all optical case , tuning range may be limited by the stiction point and therefore the initial nanobeam gap . in the case of tuning with reduced noise",
    "a tunable master laser source is required .",
    "depending upon the geometry and application , there may also be issues associated with the absorption of the master laser light field , and its contribution to optical pumping of the slave cavity and the resulting generated free carriers .",
    "not withstanding these potential shortcomings , we have shown that for reasonable master laser dropped power levels of @xmath169w-@xmath73  mw , a large radiation pressure force tuning of the slave cavity can be achieved up to a range of @xmath70  nm .",
    "lower power actuation is attained by increasing the q - factor or decreasing the static spring constant .",
    "the latter is associated with an increase in thermo - mechanical laser frequency noise .",
    "we have shown that a self - compensation of the thermal noise occurs in the optical tuning case due to dynamical back - action of the light field on the mechanical system via the optical spring effect .",
    "even for the lowest static spring @xmath63  n / m considered in this work , the thermo - mechanical wavelength noise is reduced to below @xmath170  pm over the full tuning range .",
    "analysis of a more conventional electrical - optical scheme is also performed to compare with the all - optical scheme .",
    "two main advantages of the electro - optical scheme are the high magnitude of force available from electrostatic actuation , even at large gap distances , and the simple electrical control mechanism . in the laser structures studied in this work ,",
    "the dc electrical tuning mechanism allows for as much as @xmath0  nm of wavelength tuning or @xmath171 of the nominal laser frequency .",
    "a drawback of the dc tuning mechanism is the inability to mediate thermal noise , except through an increase of the stiffness of the mechanical structure which in turn reduces the tuning range for a given applied voltage .",
    "the use of an ac voltage does allow for the increase of dynamic spring constant through electrical spring phenomena ; however , the reduction of noise via the electrical spring is significantly less than in the optical case primarily because of the larger , attainable @xmath13-factor in the optical domain .",
    "the @xmath13 of an rlc circuit can potentially be substantially increased by moving to superconducting materials at low temperature  @xcite , although going to such means removes many of the practical advantages of the electro - optical scheme .",
    "numerous trade - offs exist between the all - optical and electrical - optical schemes .",
    "although not studied here , one may envision a hybridized approach in which coarse laser frequency tuning is performed via electrostatic actuation , and fine laser frequency tuning and laser frequency stabilization are performed by an optical control field .",
    "there are also other interesting laser phenomena in addition to simple laser tuning that may be explored in similar optomechanical laser systems .",
    "the tuning dependence upon the master laser dropped power , and thus master laser frequency , in the all - optical case may be used as a frequency lock of master and slave lasers .",
    "the consideration of radiation pressure effects resulting from internal radiation , as in the case of the slave laser , leads to a whole new set of nonlinear dynamical equations and effects .",
    "such effects include self - frequency - locking and mode - locking@xcite .",
    "future work will aim to theoretically and experimentally explore these new dimensions to active cavity optomechanical systems .",
