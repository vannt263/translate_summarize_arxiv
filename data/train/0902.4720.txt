    "the past decade has witnessed a flood of new observational insights into the x - ray cooling flow phenomenon in the cores of galaxy clusters . on the x - ray side , results from _ xmm - newton _ and _",
    "chandra _ have led to a sharp downward revision in x - ray cooling rates and exposed a strong deficit of line emission from gas cooling below one third of the ambient cluster temperature ( see review by peterson & fabian  2006 ) .",
    "the implication is that the cooling of the hot x - ray gas is quenched , with the most likely cause being that episodic outbursts from radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) somehow heat the gas ( see review of mcnamara & nulsen  2007 ) .",
    "significant progress has also been made on the discovery and characterization of various phases of cool gas and dust in cluster cores . in co line emission , edge  ( 2001 ) reported detections of 16 clusters , consistent with @xmath3  of 2  at 2040  for a standard co:2  conversion ( see also salom & combes  2003 ) .",
    "interferometry showed further that the co emission is localised within the central few arcsec of the central cluster galaxy ( ccg ) ( edge & frayer  2003 ; salom & combes  2004 ) .",
    "the co emission often coincides with k - band rovibrational emisison from much smaller masses ( @xmath4 ) of 2  at @xmath5  ( edge et al .",
    "2002 ; jaffe , bremer & van der werf  2001 ) .",
    "similarly , mid - infrared spectroscopy with _",
    "spitzer _ has revealed pure rotational 2  emission from molecular gas at 300400  in several systems ( e.g. egami et al .",
    "2006a , johnstone et al .  2007 ) .",
    "all these molecular emission line components appear to correlate well with the strength of h@xmath0 emission whose prevalence in these systems , often in the form of spectacular filamentary systems , has been known for several decades .",
    "the most comprehensive spectroscopic survey for h@xmath0 emission is that of crawford et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who showed that in the most luminous systems the emission is powered by massive star formation .",
    "the latter is also the heating mechanism for the excess thermal far infrared dust emission discovered by _",
    "spitzer mips _ photometry of a sample of ccgs by egami et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "these results are corroborated by the more extensive _",
    "photometric survey of line - emitting ccgs by quillen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , revealing excess far - infrared emission in about half the sample , consistent with star - formation in the known molecular gas reservoirs ( odea et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the emerging consensus is that whilst agn heating successfully offsets most of the cooling in a time - avergaed sense , residual cooling to sub - x - ray temperatures persists at levels of , at most , a few per cent of the rates previously expected .",
    "this gas accumulates in molecular gas reservoirs within the central galaxy , giving rise to star formation and associated emission line nebulosity .",
    "the physical processes at work in these cooled gas reservoirs are , however , not well understood .",
    "it is not known whether the star formation is steady and continuous or subject to outbursts , perhaps triggered by the central radio - loud agn or interaction with a passing galaxy .",
    "the excitation mechanisms of the emission line nebulosity are also uncertain : whilst star formation can power the h@xmath0 emission on energetic grounds , the overall emission line spectrum differs markedly from a typical hii region or starburst galaxy , with optical forbidden and rovibrational 2  lines being far stronger than observed in such systems ( e.g. wilman et al .",
    "simulations by ferland et al .",
    "( 2008,2009 ) suggest that the 2  emission in ccgs may arise from excitation by cosmic rays or heating via dissipative magnetohydrodynamic processes in dense gas shielded from external radiation fields .",
    "support for this scenario comes from _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations of the h@xmath0 filaments in ngc 1275 by fabian et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who showed that the filaments can be supported by threads of magnetic field and thereby stabilised against collapse and star formation .    to shed further light on the cool gas systems in cluster cores",
    ", we have begun detailed studies of individual systems using optical and near - infrared integral field spectroscopy .",
    "the aim is to map the warm ionized gas and hot molecular hydrogen to reveal their spatial distributions , kinematics and excitation properties . in the first paper , wilman , edge & johnstone ( 2005 ) presented high - resolution near - infrared integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) of the nuclear region of ngc 1275 using _ uist _ on _ ukirt _ , leading to the discovery of a 50-pc radius disk of hot 2 and a dynamical measurement of the nuclear black hole mass , the latter in good agreement with the @xmath6 relation .",
    "the existence of this disk has been confirmed by first results from the adaptive optics near - infrared integral field spectrograph _",
    "( nifs ) _ on the _ gemini _ telescope ( mcgregor et al .  2007 ) .",
    "observations of ngc 1275 with the _ smithsonian millimetre array _ by lim et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown how this disk is fed from the inflow of cool molecular gas along filaments extending out to radii of 8 .",
    "these filaments coincide with the coolest x - ray plasma between the two radio cavities , and together these observations demonstrate , for the first time , how the cooling of x - ray gas in a cluster core feeds the central supermassive black hole .    in a second study ,",
    "wilman , edge & swinbank ( 2006 ) presented _ vlt - vimos _ optical ifs of four of the most h@xmath0-luminous ccgs known .",
    "the full 2-d view revealed a variety of disturbed morphologies , ranging from the smooth but distorted to the extremely clumpy and disturbed , with velocity gradients and splittings of several hundred  on scales of 20  or more , and evidence for an association between disturbed h@xmath0 emission and secondary galaxies .",
    "the global h@xmath0 kinematics match those of the co(1 - 0 ) emission in single - dish data , suggesting that they arise in the same gas clouds . the kinematic coupling between the h@xmath0 and ro - vibrational 2  emission appears less strong .",
    "despite the disturbed kinematics , the ratio of optical forbidden line emission to h@xmath0 is remarkably constant within and between ccgs , implying that the line ratios in these extreme environments are saturating due to widespread star formation .",
    "less luminous systems exhibit more spatial variation in line ratios ( e.g. hatch et al .  2007 ) , as expected if star formation is more patchy and irregular .    to build on this work ,",
    "we present in this paper near - infrared ifs with _ vlt - sinfoni _ of three ccgs ( two from the wilman et al .  2006 sample ) , to perform a direct comparison between the pa@xmath0 and 2  emission at high spatial and spectral resolution . compared with our previous studies , _ vlt - sinfoni _",
    "instrument offers a 5-fold improvement in spatial sampling over _ vlt - vimos _ , and substantially better sensitivity than _ ukirt - uist_.",
    "the observations of the ccgs of a1664 , a2204 and pks 0745 - 191 were taken in service mode in 2006 with the sinfoni integral field unit ( ifu ) ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "2003 ) on ut4 of the very large telescope ( vlt ) at the european southern observatory in paranal , chile",
    ". the observation dates and exposure times are listed in table 1 .",
    "the ifu was operated throughout in the @xmath7  @xmath8 field - of - view mode , with 32 slitlets of 0.25  width , with a detector pixel scale of 0.125  along the slits .",
    "the k - band grism spanning a wavelength range of 1.95 - 2.45  at resolution @xmath9 was employed , resulting in a dispersion of @xmath10  per pixel .",
    "the instrument was operated without adaptive optics and with an abba pattern of 300  s on / off source exposures to enable sky subtraction .",
    "the seeing was approximately 1  throughout .",
    "standard pipeline data reduction was carried out using the esorex pipeline . in brief",
    ", the reduction comprises the following steps : correction for bad pixels , flat fielding , correction for geometrical distortion , arc - line - based wavelength calibration , subtraction of sky emission ( using abba sequences ) and merging of the individual frames into a single data cube for each object , with sub - pixel dithering enabling re - sampling to square pixels of 0.125 .",
    "a refined background subtraction was performed during post - processing in idl , using a background spectrum synthesised from regions free of ccg line emission in the pipeline - reduced datacubes .",
    "all subsequent scientific analysis was also performed in idl .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated but a telluric standard was not observed , potentially corrupting the spectra outside the 2.082.34  window of clean atmospheric transmission .",
    "this is for the most part not a problem because most of the emission lines of interest lie in this range .",
    "the exception is pks 0745 - 191 , where pa@xmath0 and 2  v=1 - 0  s(5 ) fall just blue - ward of 2.08 . in this one target ,",
    "we corrected for this during the analysis by dividing the raw spectra by a scaled version of the standard mauna kea atmospheric transmission curve for a comparable spectral resolution ( the data were obtained from the ukirt worldwide webpages , and originally produced using the program irtrans4 ) .",
    "the scaling ( i.e. the absorption optical depth ) was adjusted in order to flatten out the continuum across the absorption troughs .    in the analysis",
    "we devote one section to each of the three ccgs , followed by some generalised conclusions .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are assumed throughout .",

    "recent analyses by rafferty et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have demonstrated the existence of a threshold for the onset of star formation and radio - loud agn activity in ccgs when the central x - ray cooling time drops below @xmath14  ( equivalent to a central entropy threshold of 30  ) .",
    "this underscores the role of agn heating as the ultimate regulator of x - ray cooling in these environments .",
    "the existence of a common ( sharp ) threshold in cooling time for star formation and agn activity suggests that both are a direct consequence of x - ray cooling . in the light of this , we discuss the current _ vlt - sinfoni _ observations and the prospects for ifs studies of larger samples of ccgs .    in a1664 , the evidence for the gravitational free - fall of cooled  and 2-emitting gas from radii @xmath15  suggests that the system is observed at an early stage in this particular cooling / heating feedback cycle .",
    "freshly cooled gas rains down on the ccg and gives rise to extensive star formation within the molecular cloud lifetime of @xmath16  ( mouschovias et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is comparable to the free - fall timescale from 10 .",
    "the agn has either not been fuelled yet or its activity is still insufficient to arrest the x - ray cooling .",
    "some of the infalling gas will eventually fuel the agn directly if its angular momentum is low , otherwise accretion may proceed via a disk ( e.g. as observed in ngc 1275 ; wilman et al .",
    "the central radio source is indeed weak with the unresolved nvss 1.4  ghz detection of 36mjy implying a monochromatic power of @xmath17 , placing it at the lower end of the radio power distribution for ccgs below the cooling time ( entropy ) threshold in cavagnolo et al .",
    "these observations of free - falling cool gas and a weak agn are consistent with the ` cold feedback ' model of pizzolato & soker  ( 2005 ) . in this model ,",
    "blobs of gas overdense by at least a critical factor @xmath18 relative to the ambient medium initially cool slowly and flow steadily inwards over a period of @xmath19  since the last agn heating event . over the next @xmath16",
    "they enter a free - fall plunge into the ccg over the final @xmath15  of radius as they cool catastrophically , contract in size and drag forces become negligible .",
    "some of this cool gas may form stars and some may fuel the agn , leading to the next major heating event and the repetition of the cycle .",
    "a1664 may well be captured in this final phase with an another agn heating event due within @xmath16 .",
    "study of a1664 by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 2009 ) confirms that the system is in a low - state of agn activity insufficient to offset the x - ray cooling , which occurs at a rate comparable to the star formation rate . the alignment between the elongated x - ray bar ( possibly a collapsed cavity system ; kirkpatrick et al . ) and the  filament further strengthens the hypothesis that the star formation is a direct result of the x - ray cooling and not triggered by interaction with a secondary galaxy as suggested by wilman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , neither of the other two ccgs in our sample is in this short - lived pre - outburst state with cool gas free - falling onto the ccg . with its kiloparsec - scale radio jet and higher power ( @xmath20  from the nvss 1.4  ghz detection ) , pks 0745 - 191",
    "is arguably observed shortly after an agn outburst with the central black hole still being fed from the gas disk observed in the extended  emission ; on nucleus , the broad - line  component and secondary 2  velocity system point to active gas accretion and a possible outflow .",
    "a2204 , with its ` ghost cavities ' and @xmath15-scale radio source ( sanders et al .",
    "2008 ) , is probably observed at a somewhat later post - outburst epoch . as argued by rafferty et al . , star formation within the cool gas reservoir can persist for more than @xmath21  and exhibit detectable signatures over several feedback cycles and will thus not appear synchronized with the latter .",
    "future ifu observations of a larger sample could identify more of these ` pre - outburst ' systems , by for example targeting the subset of clusters in the cavagnolo et al .",
    "sample which have central cooling times below the critical threshold but weak ( i.e. currently undetected ) radio emission .",
    "studies of the multiphase cool gas in such systems could shed light on the black hole fuelling mechanisms and further constrain the ` cold feedback ' model .",

    "we thank chris odea for permission to use their proprietory hst image of a1664 , brian mcnamara for communicating a pre - print of their _ chandra _ study of a1664 ( kirkpatrick et al . ) , and the referee for a prompt and valuable report .",
