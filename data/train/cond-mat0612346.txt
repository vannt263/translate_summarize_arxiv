    "recent experimental studies have revealed rich physics of thin ferromagnetic films with an easy axis of magnetization normal to the film plane.@xcite such films possess several magnetic phases in which the magnetization can be uniformly normal to the plane , canted , or periodically modulated in one direction ( striped ) .",
    "magnetization curves exhibit intricate magnetic hysteresis indicating coexistence of phases . magnetic probes with sub - micron resolution provide detailed information about nucleation and growth of new domains during the magnetization reversal.@xcite these developments fuel the need for a theoretical understanding of ferromagnetism in thin films .",
    "theoretical studies of thin films with magnetic moments pointing out of the plane date back to the 1980s.@xcite the simplest model describes ising spins with local ferromagnetic exchange and long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "a competition between these forces makes the uniform ferromagnetic states unstable towards a spontaneous formation of magnetic stripes with an alternating sign of the magnetization .",
    "the stripe period is a mesoscopic length determined by the relative strengths of exchange and dipolar interactions .",
    "a major drawback of the dipolar ising model is the neglect of the in - plane components of magnetization , which become important when the magnetization rotates away from the plane normal , a process known as the reorientation phase transition ( rpt ) .",
    "a minimal model must therefore use a three - dimensional vector of magnetization whose magnitude @xmath1 is considered fixed well below the curie temperature and whose orientation is given by the colatitude @xmath2 and azimuth @xmath3 : @xmath4 with the @xmath5 axis normal to the film plane @xmath6 . in a state with uniform magnetization , the energy density contains the easy - axis anisotropy @xmath7 and the demagnetizing term @xmath8 due to the magnetic field . in the absence of an applied field the rpt occurs when the anisotropy drops below the critical strength @xmath9 .",
    "the assumption of uniform magnetization breaks down in the vicinity of the rpt : as in the dipolar ising model , the competition between local and long - range forces leads to the formation of stripes with a mesoscopic period that depends on the effective anisotropy @xmath10 , exchange strength @xmath11 , and the film thickness @xmath12.@xcite depending on the anisotropy and on the strength of an applied magnetic field , the stripes can appear as a weak spin - density wave ( sdw ) in the background of uniform magnetization or as fairly wide domains of uniform magnetization separated by narrow domain walls .",
    "the presence of the in - plane components of magnetization leads to an important distinction of domain walls from their counterparts in the ising model : the vector of magnetization _ rotates _ between the ( mostly ) upward and downward directions .",
    "thus domain walls are endowed with in - plane magnetization , a fact with important topological consequences .",
    "the domain walls are of the bloch type : the in - plane magnetization on them points along the wall .",
    "in contrast to neel walls ( in - plane magnetization normal to the wall ) , bloch walls do not generate stray magnetic field and thus have a lower magnetic energy .",
    "we will therefore specialize to magnetization configurations in which the vector of magnetization depends on a single coordinate @xmath13 and lies in the @xmath14 plane : @xmath15    using a variational approach , berger and erickson @xcite obtained a phase diagram of such a one - dimensional model as a function of the anisotropy @xmath10 and an applied out - of - plane field @xmath16 .",
    "it exhibits several phases with both first and second - order transitions between them .",
    "berger and erickson focussed on _ thermodynamic _ transitions and did not provide boundaries of metastability .",
    "such boundaries are important for the understanding of magnetic hysteresis in thin films .",
    "often thermal activation is insufficient to initiate the decay of a metastable phase and magnetization reversal begins only when that phase becomes locally unstable .    in this work",
    "we describe several new results .",
    "our main achievement is the determination of out - of - plane magnetization curves @xmath17 that can be directly compared with experimental data .",
    "we show that , for sufficiently thin films , the shape of the magnetization curve depends on a single parameter that is a function of the dimensionless effective anisotropy @xmath18 , film thickness @xmath12 , and the magnetic exchange length @xmath19 .",
    "this universality is the consequence of a scaling property of the free energy in the thin - film limit .",
    "a proper rescaling of the anisotropy @xmath20 and magnetic field @xmath16 yields a universal phase diagram .",
    "we point out the existence of critical points of the liquid - gas type that terminate lines of thermodynamic first - order phase transitions between striped and sdw phases .",
    "finally , we discuss the behavior of stripes near the edge of the film .",
    "we find a tendency for stripes to meet an edge perpendicularly , independent of the particular shape of stripe .",
    "the formalism used in this work is minimization of the free energy .",
    "the average out - of - plane magnetization in a sample with stripes is chiefly dependent on the average period of those stripes rather than their orientational or translational order .",
    "we thus neglect the influence of thermal fluctuations , which tend to disrupt that orientational and translational order in the stripe phase.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we derive the functional of magnetic free energy specialized to one - dimensional variations , describe its scaling properties in a thin - film limit , and introduce appropriately rescaled variables .",
    "we illustrate its use by finding the lines of instability of the uniform phases in the anisotropy - applied field phase diagram . in section [ stripes ]",
    "we determine the boundaries of metastability of nonuniform phases and magnetization curves using a numerical minimization .",
    "we also find the location of the stripe - sdw critical points in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "section [ edge ] deals with the behavior of stripes near the film edge . some useful intermediate results are described in the appendixes .",
    "the free - energy functional for a thin ferromagnetic film of thickness @xmath12 can be separated into a local and long - range parts .",
    "the local part includes the exchange , uniaxial anisotropy , and zeeman energies : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the three - dimensional unit vector pointing along the magnetization and @xmath24 is the two - dimensional gradient in the plane of the film .",
    "the long - range part is due to dipolar interactions : @xmath25 where the dipolar kernel @xmath26 reflects the interaction of magnetic charges with densities @xmath27 induced on the top and bottom surfaces of the film .",
    "the expression for the dipolar energy ( [ eq - dipolar ] ) is valid provided that there are no magnetic charges in the bulk of the film , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this condition is compatible with eq .",
    "( [ eq - bloch ] ) , which describes a system with bloch domain walls .",
    "domain walls of the neel type generate additional dipolar terms .    specializing to one - dimensional configurations without bulk magnetic charges ( [ eq - bloch ] ) , and with magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of the film ,",

    "the one - dimensional kernel @xmath32 obtained by integrating ( [ eq - dipolar ] ) over @xmath31 has the fourier transform @xmath33 the taylor expansion ( [ momentumkernel ] ) is justified when the film thickness @xmath12 is the shortest length scale in the problem .",
    "the zeroth - order term @xmath34 can be interpreted as a contact part of the dipolar interaction that simply shifts the anisotropy : @xmath35 .",
    "the first - order term @xmath36 represents the effect of the stray dipolar field .",
    "its inverse fourier transform @xmath37 diverges at short length scales and requires a short - range cutoff .",
    "it has the following properties : @xmath38      it is convenient to use natural scales for various physical units : @xmath9 for the effective anisotropy @xmath20 and volume energy density , and @xmath1 for magnetic field : @xmath39 in these units , @xmath40              \\label{locale}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the exchange length .",
    "the free energy , given by the sum of these terms , is invariant under a scaling transformation @xmath43 this symmetry indicates that the state of the film depends on the effective anisotropy and magnetic field through scale - invariant variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is an effective anisotropy scale whose significance will be clarified shortly .",
    "it also yields a characteristic length scale @xmath47 , which determines the period of the stripes  see eq .",
    "( [ eq - k0 ] ) below .",
    "the free energy is scale - invariant only to the lowest order in the film thickness @xmath12 .",
    "inclusion of higher - order terms in the dipolar kernel ( [ momentumkernel ] ) violates this property .",
    "the scaling works as long as the thickness @xmath12 is small compared to all other length scales , in particular the exchange length @xmath48 nm ( for co ) .",
    "note that this scaling law applies more generally to two - dimensional configurations with an applied field in any direction , as the energies associated with bulk magnetic charges and in plane fields are also invariant under ( [ eq - scaling ] ) when @xmath12 is small .",
    "let us first discuss the uniform phases and their instabilities in the case that the applied field is normal to the plane .",
    "the case @xmath49 is trivial : only the upward and downward polarized states are stable .",
    "both are locally stable in the region @xmath50 .",
    "the coexistence leads to a hysteresis in magnetization curves @xmath51 .",
    "the situation is more interesting for @xmath52 , where magnetization prefers the in - plane direction . in a uniform state",
    "the stray field vanishes and the energy is proportional to @xmath53 . in a strong field ,",
    "@xmath54 , the film is fully polarized , @xmath55 . below the critical strength , @xmath56 , the magnetization is canted , @xmath57 .",
    "the uniform - to - canted transitions at @xmath58 are continuous .",
    "consider the free energy of small fluctuations around a canted state , @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fourier transform of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the equilibrium value for the canted state .",
    "the softest mode has the wavenumber @xmath64 a spin - density wave develops in the canted background on the line @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "an expansion to the order @xmath67 reveals a positive - definite quartic term .",
    "thus the canted - sdw transition is also continuous .",
    "note that the scaling arguments are confirmed : the wavelength is indeed set by the scale @xmath68 and the critical line ( [ eq - sdw ] ) contains the rescaled variables @xmath69 and @xmath44 .",
    "since no uniform solution is stable inside the semicubic parabola ( [ eq - sdw ] ) , this region must be occupied by an inhomogeneous state , which one might easily guess to be a stripe phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - uphases ] ) .",
    "however , the situation is somewhat more complicated .",
    "a further analysis shows that the stripe phase remains ( at least locally ) stable outside the semicubic curve .",
    "in addition , we find a region of coexistence between a strongly inhomogeneous striped state and a weakly inhomogeneous sdw state . like a liquid and a gas , the two phases differ from each other only quantitatively . indeed",
    ", there is a critical point at which the differences vanish continuously , as we will discuss below .",
    "in this section , we describe the striped state in various regions of the @xmath70 plane .",
    "we determine the approximate boundaries of stability of the striped phase , and show how the metastability of the stripe phase leads to the hysteresis curves observed in experiments .          in order to find the boundaries of stability of the striped phase",
    ", we performed a numerical simulation of the system described by eqs .",
    "( [ locale ] ) and ( [ straye ] ) .",
    "the simulation was conducted on a chain of 2048 magnetization vectors of unit length described by the angle @xmath71 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied .",
    "we used specific values for the exchange length and thickness of @xmath72 and @xmath73 lattice spacings , respectively .",
    "however , based on the scaling arguments described in section [ scaling ] , we expect the results to be universal for thin films .",
    "( [ locale ] ) was minimized using a relaxation method,@xcite where @xmath74 was replaced by @xmath75 to account for the dipolar stray field .",
    "this @xmath76 was recalculated after a number of iterations of the relaxation method .",
    "the process continued until the lagrange equation , @xmath77 was satisfied at each point .",
    "random noise was then added to the system and @xmath74 was incremented . in this way",
    ", the algorithm moved the state of the system along the local minimum of energy .",
    "sweeps of the magnetization were conducted from positive to negative values of @xmath74 and the average magnetization was recorded .",
    "the hysteresis loops shown in fig .  [ all - hyst ] were produced from these single sweeps by rotating the data points to produce the upward sweep and superimposing it on the downward one .",
    "discontinuous jumps in the magnetization mark the system s entry into and exit from the striped phase . in",
    "what follows , we interpret the resulting phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ phase diagram ] ) for various values of the effective anisotropy",
    ".    an important feature of phase diagram revealed by the numerical simulation is the existence of liquid - gas like critical points at @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ phase diagram ] ) . to the right of this point",
    ", a distinction can be made between a striped phase , with large modulation around a small average magnetization , and a spin - density wave phase , which has a small modulation around a larger average magnetization .",
    "boundaries of metastability extend from the critical points , surrounding regions of coexistence between the striped and sdw phases . to the left of @xmath80 the two phases merge into one and magnetization curves proceed in a reversible manner .",
    "it is important to note that for @xmath81 , the second - order phase transition line out of the canted phase is very close to the first - order phase transition line into the striped phase . as such",
    ", this second - order transition may be difficult to detect as it is hidden by the nearby first - order jump .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we describe the results of a sweep of the applied magnetic field beginning in high positive field normal to the sample and moving to a high negative field .",
    "the results of such a sweep depend on the anisotropy constant @xmath44 describing the system .    for strong enough in - plane anisotropy , @xmath82 , the striped phase is never seen .",
    "a sweep of magnetic field from high positive to high negative fields would find a completely reversible magnetization curve , with the uniform upward phase beginning to ca nt at @xmath83 and following the field smoothly and linearly .",
    "the magnetization will be @xmath84 until the field is decreased to the @xmath85 line , from which point onward the sample is downwardly polarized .    for anisotropy values only slightly greater than the rpt value @xmath86 , a modulation of the magnetization will appear in low fields .",
    "the magnetization curve will still be reversible , but no longer exactly linear .",
    "once the magnetic field crosses the curve @xmath87 from above , a small modulation out of the canted phase develops continuously . that modulation fades again at the lower curve @xmath88 , and the system proceeds as before from the canted to the uniform down phase .    .",

    "this stripe phase remains as the field decreases until finally the system undergoes a first - order transition in which the periodic modulation disappears .",
    "the boundary of stability of the striped phase crosses @xmath85 , the line beyond which the downwardly magnetized state is stable , so that for more negative values of @xmath20 , the striped phase decays to a canted phase , while for more positive @xmath20 values , the system enters the downwardly polarized state . for example , in fig .",
    "[ all - hyst ] , the @xmath90 and @xmath91 magnetization curves show the striped phase decaying into the canted phase , while the other loops show a decay directly into the fully polarized phase .    for a small @xmath49 ,",
    "as we conduct a downward sweep of the field beginning at large positive values , the system undergoes a first - order phase transition out of the upwardly polarized state at @xmath83 .",
    "there is no canted or spin - wave phase after the transition , but the simulations indicate that there is an intervening stable state with non - constant magnetization before the system decays into the downwardly polarized state .",
    "the limitations of the simulation become evident here .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions imposed in the simulation do not allow us to distinguish between a periodic state with a long period and a state with an isolated region of unfavored magnetization ( soliton ) .",
    "only a small number of solitons appeared within the period forced by the simulation .",
    "the considerations of sections [ zero - trans ] and [ collapse ] indicate that for large enough @xmath20 the isolated soliton state is stable while the striped state is not .",
    "whether this holds at small @xmath49 has not been determined .",
    "the non - uniform state resulting from the first - order phase transition out of the upwardly polarized state persists until it vanishes in a first - order transition to the downward state ( at @xmath92 in the simulation ) .",
    "if one were to reverse course and increase the field again before reaching this second transition , the upward regions that had been unfavored would grow slowly rather than the system returning immediately to the totally upwardly polarized phase .",
    "this behavior accounts for the  fading contrast \" seen in experiments with co / pt multilayers.@xcite    if @xmath49 is large enough , we expect that the transition will proceed directly from an upwardly polarized state to a downwardly polarized state at @xmath83 .",
    "for very large @xmath20 , neither a striped nor an isolated - soliton phase can form from the decay of the upwardly polarized state , as neither will be stable in the high fields required for the uniform state to become unstable .",
    "( see sections [ zero - trans ] and [ collapse ] ) .",
    "there is a caveat on this expectation , however .",
    "if topologically non - trivial domains of reversed magnetization form during the transition out of the upwardly polarized phase , it may be that they are stable even in these large fields .",
    "a topologically non - trivial domain in our case is one for which the magnetization angle @xmath2 at the left end of the domain differs by a non - zero multiple of @xmath93 from the magnetization angle at the right end .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect the formation of such domains : if two downward regions form during the transition by rotating in opposite directions away from @xmath94 then the upwardly polarized region between them will be topologically non - trivial .",
    "since these downward regions may be initially well separated , their rotation directions are essentially independent , and so a non - trivial upward domain will form between them roughly half the time .",
    "these non - trivial domains are the one - dimensional analog of skyrmion - type domains in two dimensions.@xcite skyrmions may be the cause of the asymmetric domain nucleation observed in co / pt multilayers.@xcite",
    "the magnetization curve would look nearly the same in the case that topologically non - trivial solitons form as it would if they do not .",
    "the topologically non - trivial solitons would have small width when the field is large and so change the magnetization by a negligible amount .",
    "however , when the field is reversed after the transition , these soliton domains would grow .",
    "this would cause the system to proceed through the striped phase rather than staying downwardly polarized until @xmath85 .",
    "hysteresis , then , would not be observed unless the applied field is strong enough to force the width of topological solitons down to the lattice scale , allowing them to decay .",
    "when the out - of - plane anisotropy is strong , the magnetization pattern is expected to consist of long up- or downwardly pointing regions , separated by short regions in which the magnetization changes rapidly from one domain type to the other .",
    "we refer to such a configuration as a  wide - stripe \" phase .",
    "( note , however , that this  phase \" is continuously connected to the modulated phase at negative @xmath20 , and so not a truly distinct phase . )",
    "it is well known that an energy advantage can be gained over a purely uniform phase through such modulation .",
    "in fact , when the out - of - plane anisotropy is very strong , the zero field model differs little from the dipolar ising model discussed by garel and doniach.@xcite the two significant differences lie in the energy costs of the kinks and in topological considerations .",
    "the topological consequences of the model will be discussed in section [ collapse ] .",
    "the wide - stripe configuration can be thought of as a periodic array of bloch domain walls .",
    "these walls can be treated as elementary objects with some internal energy cost and long range interactions with other walls through the stray dipolar field .",
    "the interaction energy of two walls is logarithmic in their separation .",
    "if we define the orientation of a wall as a vector pointing from the upwardly magnetized side of the wall to the downwardly magnetized side , we find that the magnetic interaction is attractive for walls with the same orientation and repulsive for walls of opposite orientation . for a periodic structure , walls always have orientation opposite that of their nearest neighbors .",
    "it is this nearest neighbor repulsion caused by the stray magnetic field that allows for the stability of a striped phase despite the cost of the walls in exchange energy and the exchange force acting between nearby walls .",
    "these considerations can be used to derive an analytic expression for the magnetization curve in the wide - stripe phase : @xmath96 where we have used the rescaled variables @xmath97 note that this magnetization curve is consistent with the scaling property described in section [ scaling ] .",
    "details of the derivation , including an analytic expression for the stripe period , can be found in appendix [ ap - wide stripes ] .",
    "as the external magnetic field is varied , the wide - stripe phase becomes dominated by the regions of magnetization favored by the magnetic field . for a strong enough magnetic field",
    "the striped phase has only narrow , widely separated regions of the unfavored magnetization ( solitons ) .",
    "( [ stable period ] ) shows , the period of the wide - stripe phase tends to infinity along the curve @xmath98 .",
    "that is , the density of the unfavored solitons reaches zero . for fields above this curve , there is no stable structure with evenly spaced domains of unfavored magnetization .",
    "note that the field at which the solitons are expelled from the system decreases exponentially with @xmath20 . for large @xmath20",
    "the region in which stripes exist is extremely narrow .",
    "as the field varies from down to up across this region , a system that is nearly all down with a few isolated upward solitons will move quickly through the striped phase to a state that is nearly all up with a few isolated downward solitons .      in a perfectly isotropic sample",
    ", the field drives all the regions of unfavored magnetization to the edge of the system during the zero - soliton - density transition described above . a real sample , however , may have pinning centers where regions of opposing magnetization would be localized .",
    "these isolated solitons will persist into a much higher field , and their collapse is dependent on their topological character .",
    "the edges of such regions interact with each other through two distinct forces .",
    "there is a long - range repulsion between them due to the dipolar stray field and a short - range exchange interaction that may be attractive or repulsive depending on the topology of the region .",
    "in addition , there is a force from the applied magnetic field that acts to increase or decrease the width of the soliton based on its polarization .",
    "if the exchange force is attractive , the boundary of stability of the isolated soliton phase is found at the field that will squeeze the soliton boundaries enough that the exchange force takes over and the solitons collapse .",
    "if the exchange force is repulsive , the soliton must be forced to a width smaller than the lattice spacing in order to collapse , so that a phase difference of @xmath93 between neighboring sites may be ignored as physically meaningless .    the exchange force between two domain walls",
    "a distance @xmath99 apart is @xmath100 where @xmath101 ( see appendix [ exchange ] ) .",
    "the force is attractive if the kinks form a non - topological soliton and repulsive if the soliton is topological .    to determine the field necessary to collapse a non - topological soliton",
    ", we take the zeeman energy of the soliton and the energy of the stray field to be @xmath102 for a single downward soliton of width @xmath99 [ see eq .  ( [ singsole ] ) ] .",
    "we use here the @xmath103 approximation , as we expect the collapse width of a non - topological soliton to be large compared to the size of the walls that border the soliton .",
    "as the field @xmath104 increases , the soliton is squeezed : @xmath105 note that as @xmath106 shrinks , the restoring force on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ squeeze ] ) increases at first and then reaches a maximum at @xmath107 a further increase in the field leads to a collapse of the soliton , as the restoring force can no longer balance the force due to the field .",
    "this justifies the approximation of large width , since for the collapse width @xmath108 .",
    "hence , in a field @xmath109 the ( non - topological ) soliton will collapse .    if , however , the soliton consists of a full @xmath93 rotation of the magnetization , the restoring force never reaches a maximum . while the dipolar contribution to the force effectively disappears as the soliton width decreases to the order of the domain wall width , the repulsive exchange force increases without bound .",
    "the soliton can then only collapse when its width @xmath110 derived in appendix [ exchange ] , reaches the lattice scale .",
    "in this section , we consider the orientation of stripes near a system edge . although we begin with a variational solution with a sinusoidal modulation , the final result is applicable to a general profile for the magnetization .",
    "we find that stripes oriented with their domain walls perpendicular to the edge are energetically favored over all other orientations except possibly that with stripes _ exactly _ parallel to the edge . for simplicity , we consider only the case of no applied field .",
    "the results are entirely similar when a field is applied . in particular",
    ", there is no change to eq .",

    ", we include a a step function @xmath120 in all @xmath31 integrals .",
    "the energy associated with the presence of an edge comes from two sources .",
    "first , stripes at the edge generate a stray magnetic field .",
    "second , depending on the sign of the effective anisotropy @xmath20 , the system can lower the energy by having an extra node or antinode near the edge .",
    "( the latter works only for stripes parallel to the edge . )",
    "the long - range nature of the dipolar forces requires a certain amount of care in evaluating the edge energy .",
    "the value of the dipolar energy is sensitive to three length scales : the film thickness @xmath12 , the width @xmath30 , and the stripe period @xmath121 . on a computational level , keeping @xmath12 and @xmath30 finite is required to avoid ultraviolet and infrared divergences .",
    "fortunately , the _ difference _ in the energies between stripes with different orientations ( parameterized by the angle @xmath115 ) is insensitive to these length scales , as long as @xmath122 .",

    "there is a cutoff dependent term in the stray field energy difference proportional to @xmath127 as long as the wavelength of the mode under consideration is larger than the thickness , the logarithm is negative .",
    "this term is therefore minimized when @xmath128 and so acts to attract the crests of the spin wave to the system edge .",
    "there is also an additional term associated with the local part of the free energy that appears only when @xmath126 .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath129 if the coefficient in brackets is positive ( negative ) , this term acts to minimize the number of nodes ( crests ) of the spin wave that are present in the system , since each node ( crest ) has a cost in the exchange and anisotropy energy .",
