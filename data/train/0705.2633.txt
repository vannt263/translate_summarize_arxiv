    "chaos theory is a blanketing theory that covers most aspects of science , hence , it shows up everywhere in the world today : mathematics , physics , biology , finance , computer and even music . as we know",
    ", chaotic systems have many interesting features , such as the sensitivity to the initial condition and control parameter , ergodicity and mixing property  @xcite , which can be connected with some cryptographic properties of good ciphers , such as confusion / diffusion , balance and avalanche property  @xcite .",
    "these properties make the chaotic systems a worthy choice for constructing the cryptosystems . compared with traditional cryptosystems  @xcite ,",
    "the ones based on chaos are more suitable for large - scale data encryption such as images , videos or audio data .",
    "furthermore , chaos - based algorithms have shown their good performance .",
    "thus , it is a natural idea to use chaos as a new source to construct new encryption systems .",
    "cryptography has become one of the fields of modern science since the celebrated shannon s work  @xcite . in general , the algorithms used for cryptographic applications are classified into two , namely , public key ( asymmetric methods ) cryptography and secret key ( symmetric methods ) cryptography .",
    "according to the structure of the symmetric algorithm , ciphers can be divided into two categories , namely , block ciphers  @xcite and stream ciphers  @xcite .",
    "the chaotic cryptography technique which we are going to use in this paper belongs to a symmetric block cipher .",
    "there exist two main approaches of designing chaos - based cryptosystems : analog and digital . the first one is generally based on the concept of chaotic synchronization , initiated by the work of pecora and carroll  @xcite , and the concerned chaotic systems are implemented in analog form .",
    "the second one is independent of chaos synchronization and the chaotic systems are completely implemented in digital computers  @xcite .",
    "the present paper mainly focuses on the digital chaotic ciphers .",
    "+ in the digital world , which is currently evolving and changing at such a rapid pace , the security of digital information has become increasingly more important .",
    "this is due to the communications of digital products over network occurring more and more frequently . so that in recent years , many different chaotic cryptosystems in digital domain have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "certainly , a main issue in all encryption techniques is their security .",
    "however , the recent development of chaotic cryptosystem is rather disappointing . on the other hand , various cryptanalysis",
    "have exposed some inherent drawbacks of chaotic cryptosystems  @xcite .",
    "some of these shortcomings are overviewed in  @xcite . + for enhancing the security of discrete chaotic cryptosystem in this paper for the first time , we introduce the concept of using hierarchy of tripled chaotic maps with an invariant measure in cryptography .",
    "six points make this new cryptosystem distinctive and advantageous compared to the other schemes .    * a very large number of fully developed chaotic maps defined in two intervals @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 . *",
    "bifurcation without any period doubling ; bifurcation from a stable single periodic state to chaotic ones without having usual period doubling or period - n - tupling scenario . *",
    "the existence of the two coupling parameters .",
    "one advantage of using two coupling parameters is for computational complexity goal .",
    "another advantage is the usage of coupling parameters in the structure of the cryptosystem for diffusion .",
    "these parameters can be used as secret keys as well .",
    "* high complexity due to high dimensionality and chaoticity .",
    "* large key space ; it is obvious that the attack complexity is determined by the size of the key space and the complexity of the verification of each key . *",
    "the flexibility of attributing different values to the control parameters .    besides the above advantages , the encryption speed is also acceptable and the ciphertext has the same size as the plaintext .",
    "in fact , the results presented in this paper totalize our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "+ this paper has been organized as follows : section 2 describes the construction and the main features of the tripled chaotic maps .",
    "current encryption schemes are introduced briefly in section 3 .",
    "the experimental results are shown in section 4 .",
    "section 5 demonstrates the security of the proposed scheme .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "we first review the one parameter families of trigonometric chaotic maps which are used to construct the tripled chaotic maps .",
    "one - parameter families of chaotic maps of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] with an invariant measure can be defined as the ratio of polynomials of degree n  @xcite : @xmath2 where * f * substitute with chebyshev polynomial of type one @xmath3 for @xmath4 and chebyshev polynomial of type two @xmath5 for @xmath6@xcite . as an example we give below some of these maps : @xmath7 the map @xmath8 is reduced to logistic one with @xmath9 .",
    "one can show that these maps have two interesting properties .",
    "it is shown that these maps have interesting property , that is , for even values of @xmath10 the @xmath11(@xmath12 ) maps have only a fixed point attractor @xmath13(@xmath14 ) provided that their parameter belongs to interval @xmath15(@xmath16 ) while , at @xmath17 @xmath18 they bifurcate to chaotic regime without having any period doubling or period - n - tupling scenario and remain chaotic for all @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) but for odd values of n , these maps have only fixed point attractor at @xmath14 for @xmath21 , again they bifurcate to a chaotic regime at @xmath22 , and remain chaotic for @xmath23 , finally they bifurcate at @xmath24 to have @xmath13 as fixed point attractor for all @xmath20 .",
    "we used their conjugate or isomorphic maps .",
    "conjugacy means that the invertible map @xmath25 maps @xmath26 $ ] into @xmath27 and transform maps @xmath28 into @xmath29 defined as : @xmath30 @xmath31 using the hierarchy of families of one - parameter chaotic maps @xmath32 , we can generate new hierarchy of tripled maps with an invariant measure .",
    "hence , by introducing a new parameter @xmath33 as a coupling parameter we form coupling among the above mentioned maps , where they can be coupled through @xmath34 and @xmath35 functions defined as : @xmath36 @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 defined as : @xmath40}c_{2k}^{n}x^{k},\\quad b_{n}(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^ { [ \\frac{n-1}{2}]}c_{2k+1}^{n}x^{k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the hierarchy of the tripled chaotic maps can be defined as : @xmath41 also , their conjugate or isomorphic maps by considering the map @xmath42 are defined as follows : @xmath43 as we know , each dynamical system has specific characteristics .",
    "in fact , the differences between discrete dynamical systems arise from these properties . due to this fact , in this paper , tripled chaotic maps",
    "are constructed for the first time .",
    "so , it is necessary to describe them through the paper . specially , the most important characteristics such as invariant measure and lyapunov characteristic exponents have been discussed .",
    "+ furthermore , many properties of the chaotic systems have their corresponding counterparts in traditional cryptosystems , such as : ergodicity and confusion , sensitivity to initial conditions / control parameter and diffusion  @xcite . for tripled chaotic maps ,",
    "we have tried to describe ergodicity from the invariant measure point of view .",
    "dynamical systems , even apparently simple dynamical systems which are described by maps of an interval can display a rich variety of different asymptotic behavior . on measure theoretical level these type of behavior are described by srb @xcite or invariant measure describing statistically stationary states of the system .",

    "<S> , we introduce a new kind of symmetric key block cipher algorithm that is based on _ tripled chaotic maps_. in this algorithm , the utilization of two coupling parameters , as well as the increased complexity of the cryptosystem , make a contribution to the development of cryptosystem with higher security . in order to increase the security of the proposed algorithm , the size of key space and the computational complexity of the coupling parameters should be increased as well . </S>",
    "<S> both the theoretical and experimental results state that the proposed algorithm has many capabilities such as acceptable speed and complexity in the algorithm due to the existence of two coupling parameter and high security . </S>",
    "<S> note that the ciphertext has a flat distribution and has the same size as the plaintext . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is suitable for practical use in secure communications . </S>"
