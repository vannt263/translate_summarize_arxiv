    "but when the plasma kinetic energy is comparable to the poynting energy , particles are magnetically reflected and execute looping motions . simulations",
    "have suggested@xcite that these looping motions are unstable , and that a shock front forms in the region of magnetic reflection .",
    "downstream of the shock , the plasma kinetic energy was seen to be mainly converted into thermal energy . since the simulations allowed particle motion in only two dimensions , it is unclear whether or not the resulting momentum distribution is isotropic .",
    "these simulations have been complemented by analytic studies@xcite of the two - stream instability , which is operative whenever the fluid is composed of counter - moving streams . since the aforementioned looping orbits present such a case , these analytical arguments suggest that the two - stream instability would dissipate the particles ordered motion on time scales comparable to the inverse plasma frequency . as the instability is saturated , the particles momentum distribution isotropizes , and the magnetic field receives significant amplification .    in several astrophysical situations , and in particular the generation of gamma - ray burst afterglows",
    ", it is important to understand what happens when a relativistic shock wave impinges on a cold plasma carrying a small amount of energy in its magnetic field , compared to the kinetic energy of the shock . in  ii we will investigate the stability of a multi - stream configuration that typically results at such an interface .",
    "we will derive a simple dispersion relation , valid when the plasma frequency is much greater than the cyclotron frequency , which indicates that this configuration is unstable .",
    "this instability acts on a time scale comparable to that observed in simulations , and provides a promising driver for heating the gas and creating the necessary jump conditions of collisionless , relativistic shocks .",
    "the instability eventually saturates and converts the ordered bulk velocity of the particles into a three - dimensional velocity distribution ( thus , playing a role similar to collisions in a normal fluid ) . in  iii , we will develop a stationary fluid model to describe the the post - shock plasma .",
    "after developing the appropriate equations , we will examine two cases in particular .",
    "first , we will investigate hot pair plasmas (  iv ) , and show that no stationary , continuous shock solutions exist .",

    "v , we will investigate the case of an electron - proton plasma . here ,",
    "the two species have very different dynamical length scales , and so we will construct a simple model in which the electrons are hot , but the protons are cold . as a first approximation , we will average over the behaviour of the electrons , and calculate the resulting fields and the motion of the protons . finally , we will consider a plasma in which both the electrons and the protons are hot .",

    "previous studies have revealed that a generic feature of an initially cold plasma carrying relatively little energy in its magnetic field is the development of multiple streams@xcite .",
    "the condition that there be little energy in the magnetic field can be stated in terms of the dimensionless ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the plasma s self - magnetic field , @xmath3 is the lorentz factor corresponding to the mean fluid velocity , @xmath4 is the proper number density , @xmath5 is the mass per particle , and @xmath6 is the speed of light . for simplicity , we suppose that the direction of the magnetic field is initially perpendicular to the mean fluid velocity .",
    "then the definition of @xmath7 indicates that it is invariant with respect to lorentz boosts in the direction of the bulk flow .",
    "this fact allows for a simple calculation of @xmath7 in the plasma s rest frame ; for electrons in the interstellar medium , @xmath8 .",
    "this small value suggests that multiple streams play an important role in the dynamics of shock and solitary waves in the interstellar medium .",
    "simulations@xcite have suggested that multi - stream situations are unstable , and thus would require a time - dependent treatment .",
    "we take an analytical approach to the question of stability by applying the collisionless boltzmann equation , @xmath9 to both species comprising a pair plasma . since @xmath10",
    ", the initial fields have negligible impact on length scales of the order of @xmath6/@xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the plasma frequency .",

    "the growth rate increases monotonically with @xmath40 and asymptotically approaches a number of the order of the plasma frequency , while the real part of the frequency grows approximately linearly with @xmath40 when @xmath41 .",

    "in the rest frame of a planar shock front , cold material is flowing at a highly supersonic speed from @xmath43 .",
    "the results derived in the previous section imply that a cold , low-@xmath7 plasma inevitably develops multiple streams and becomes unstable around the shock front .",
    "simulations have shown that the instability tends to heat the plasma and eventually saturate@xcite .",

    "next we examine under what conditions the constant solution is unique . since the jump conditions of@xcite were unique , the equations of a hot plasma can not admit continuous shock wave solutions .",

    "( [ eq : it10 ] ) and ( [ eq : it11 ] ) , it is clear that all quantities must be bounded . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : it11 ] ) , we can consider @xmath86 to be a function of @xmath57 .",
    "as @xmath57 goes to zero through positive values , @xmath87 . as @xmath57 increases , @xmath86 increases monotonically , eventually becomes positive , reaches a maximum , and then decreases monotonically .",
    "therefore the reality of @xmath2 implies the existence of a maximum and minimum value of @xmath57 , and also an upper limit on the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "we do not consider the case where @xmath57 is less than zero so as to avoid instabilities .",
    "( [ eq : eulerx ] ) and ( [ eq : eulery ] ) show that the derivatives of the four - velocity diverge at a certain value of @xmath57 .",
    "this occurs because of the presence of the pressure terms , and is absent in the zero - temperature case .",
    "this divergence might be remedied by more exact equations of state .",
    "the presence of this divergence , however , complicates the case under consideration .",
    "this divergence occurs at a value of @xmath57 such that @xmath2 is real ; in fact , it occurs at value of @xmath57 such that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : it11 ] ) is maximized .",
    "so we must now not only look for a bounded solution , but a bounded solution for which both turning points of @xmath57 are on the same side of this singularity .    on each side of the singularity",
    ", there is exactly one point where @xmath88 .",
    "oscillatory solutions require at least two extrema of @xmath57 , so it is clear that we must find at least one extremum of @xmath57 where @xmath89 .",
    "but in fact we must find at least two .",
    "for suppose that there exists an oscillatory solution on the right of the singularity . then there must exist a minimum of @xmath57 such that @xmath89 in between the singularity and the point where @xmath88 .",
    "examination of the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eulerx ] ) indicates that @xmath90 for a minimum of @xmath57 at such a point .",
    "since the only place where @xmath2 could go through zero is at a maximum of @xmath57 , we see that if @xmath2 ever becomes less than zero there no longer exists the possibility of minimum , and so the ` solution ' will inevitably become singular . applying similar reasoning to the left side of the singularity , we see that at any maximum of @xmath57 , @xmath90 .",
    "we conclude as follows : any possible oscillatory solutions must have @xmath90 everywhere . as a corollary",
    ", there must exist at least two turning points of @xmath57 ( and also @xmath2 ) where @xmath89 .",
    ".minimum values of @xmath7 required for oscillating , steady - state solutions in a collisionless pair plasma .",
    "a value of @xmath91 is assumed for the adiabatic index . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     analytical study of non - constant solutions of these differential equations is much more complicated than in the preceeding cases . here",
    "again , one must deal with coupled differential equations .",
    "one can try averaging over the electrons orbits , but solving for @xmath92 is no longer straightforward , since it is no longer easy to eliminate @xmath93 .",
    "we have , however , numerically integrated these equations with @xmath10 and @xmath94 , and have failed to find satisfactory solutions .",
    "we have examined the equations of a hot pair plasma , a plasma of hot electrons and cold protons , and finally a plasma in which both electrons and protons are hot . in none of these cases were continuous shock wave solutions found .",
    "however , we have seen that a cold plasma with a small , embedded magnetic field is subject to a version of the two - stream instability , which is a likely mechanism for the generation of collisionless shocks .",
    "the standard two - stream instability can only be saturated by nonlinear effects because of its aperiodic nature , indicating that the magnetic field may be significantly amplified@xcite . but with this modified two - stream instability , both the real and imaginary parts of the frequency are nonzero , and so kinetic effects such as collisionless damping and resonance broadening may play an important role in the eventual saturation .",
    "the final level of magnetic field amplification is unclear .",
    "since the growth rate of the instability is much higher than the cyclotron frequency , we expect this instability to be a dominant influence in the formation of a collisionless shock .",
    "we have also investigated the possible existence of soliton solutions in a hot , pair plasma . as with cold plasmas",
    ", we have found that such solutions exist only for @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the only time - independent solution is one that is independent of the spatial coordinate .",
    "this simple structure has been observed in numerical simulations @xcite , which do suggest spatially uniform solutions , with physical quantities equal to the values predicted by the jump conditions .",
    "we have also considered a model consisting of hot electrons and cold protons .",
    "since we have averaged over the electrons orbits , this model is essentially independent of the electrons equations of state . in this case",
    "again we have found that the unique solution for a relativistic , low-@xmath7 plasma is the spatially uniform one .",
    "finally , we obtained the jump conditions for the state of a hot plasma of electrons and protons that was initially cold and had undergone a collisionless shock .",
    "as in the other cases , we have found that almost all of the plasma energy is converted into pressure .",
    "the magnetic field gets amplified by a factor of @xmath0 in the shock frame , and the post - shock value of @xmath7 is only amplified by a factor of @xmath96 . in many astrophysical situation ,",
    "this leaves the fraction of energy contained in the magnetic field still far below the equipartition limit .",
    "numerical simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks would be very useful in understanding whether these jump conditions are appropriate , and whether or not the adopted model of a quiescent , low-@xmath7 plasma is adequate . in particular , such simulations",
    "would also provide information on the relative thermal lorentz factors for the electrons and protons , which is of fundamental importance for models of the relativistic blast wave in gamma - ray burst afterglows@xcite .",
