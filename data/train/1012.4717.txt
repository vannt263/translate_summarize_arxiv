    "bulk mnas exhibits a ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) of 313 k , @xcite where it is accompanied by a structural phase transition going from the fm @xmath1-phase to the orthorhombic @xmath2-phase and as the temperature is raised to 398 k mnas exhibits an additional phase transition back to a hexagonal @xmath5-phase .",
    "the long term interest in mnas lies in the first order magnetostructural phase transition with a @xmath4 that can be altered by for instance applying a stress to the material resulting in tensile / compressive strain of the mnas lattice .",
    "@xcite when mnas is deposited on a gaas substrate as a thin film , mnas undergoes a strain induced increase in @xmath4 and moreover develops a two phase region where the @xmath1- and @xmath2-phases coexist between approximately 280 and 340 k.@xcite the magnetic transition temperature depends on choice of substrate , e.g. mnas / gaas(001 ) has a @xmath0=320 k while mnas / gaas(111)b has a @xmath0=346 k , @xcite as well as on strain , e.g. stretching of the @xmath6-axis and compression of the @xmath7-axis induce a reduction of @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite even though the films are fully relaxed after just a few monolayers @xcite the strain induced @xmath4 increase seems to prevail in thicker films and through application of high magnetic fields the @xmath2-phase can be transformed back to the @xmath1-phase even above @xmath4 due to the structural strain .",
    "@xcite the magnetic nature of the @xmath2-phase has been under debate where some consider it to be paramagnetic @xcite while later suggestions point out that it has an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) short ranged structure , @xcite albeit without long range order .",
    "@xcite investigations of the magnetic anisotropy have determined , counter intuitively , that for mnas the easy axis of magnetization lies along the @xmath7-axis ( [ @xmath8-direction ) and the hard axis along the @xmath6-axis ( [ 0001]-direction ) .",

    "the mnas films were grown in a kryovak mbe system , using epi - ready gaas wafers with ( 100 ) orientation as substrates .",
    "the substrates were attached to molybdenum holders by liquid in gluing , which ensures uniformity of the substrate temperature during the mbe growth .",

    "an as cracking cell ( by dca instruments ) operated at 900@xmath14 c was used as the arsenic source .",
    "after the buffer layer growth the temperature of the as cracker was lowered to 600@xmath14c , which changes the as flux from as dimer rich to as tetramer ( as@xmath15 ) rich and the substrate temperature was lowered to about 250 @xmath14c .",

    "the growth was monitored by a reflection energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) system .",
    "the rheed images evolved rather quickly from two - dimensional ( 2d ) 4@xmath164 streaky patterns originating from the gaas surface to diffraction spots indicating formation of mnas islands during the initial growth stage .",
    "when the growth proceeded the rheed images from mnas : gaas(100 ) evolved to an admixture of three - dimensional spotty and 2d streaky patterns , which were visible up to a mnas film thickness of about 500  .",
    "the spotty patterns eventually disappeared for thicker mnas films . to prevent mnas surface oxidation after the mbe growth",

    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the final theoretical result we would like to discuss is the relationship between mae and the anisotropy of the orbital moment when measureed along an easy and hard magnetisation direction , the so called orbital moment anisotropy ( oma ) shown in fig .",
    "[ maexch]c . from perturbation",
    "theory it has been shown @xcite that there is a direct coupling between the mae and the oma .",
    "the derivation is made under the assumption that cross - terms in the spin - orbit interaction ( i.e. @xmath101 ) can be neglected compared to diagonal terms ( i.e. @xmath102 ) . for a material composed of one element this relationship holds well , and there is a direct proportionality between the mae and oma .",
    "however , a generalization of this theory to materials composed of more than one element , shows a more complex behavior , @xcite since both the mae and oma may have contributions from spin - orbit effects of all atomic species of the material . in short",
    ", this means that for a material like mnas , the mae of the magnetic moment , which is primarily located on the mn atom , is also influenced by the spin - orbit interaction of the as atom .",
    "since there are cross terms in atomic site index to both the mae and oma , which are large when there is strong hybridization of electron states centered on different atomic sites , there is no reason to expect a linear relationship between the mae and oma .",
    "figure  [ maeoma ] shows a comparison between calculated values of the mae and oma , for different values of the @xmath3-ratio .",
    "again , the calculations were done by keeping either the @xmath7-axis or the @xmath6-axis fixed .",
    "note from the figure that the linear relationship between oma and mae is lost .",
    "hence , for this material it is misleading to measure the oma and from this value try to draw conclusions about the mae .",
    "this has previously been shown experimentally for au / co thin films.@xcite        the electronic structure of mnas has been analyzed in the past @xcite using lsda and/or gga . a relevant question for this material concerns the influence of electron correlations , which might be important for the electronic structure and hence also for the magnetic properties .",
    "mn compounds often display electronic structures which have a correlated electronic @xmath85-shell , that may even become localized due to strong electron - electron interaction .",
    "examples of this are lsmo ( i.e la@xmath103sr@xmath104mno@xmath105 ) @xcite and mno.@xcite electron correlation has recently been discussed even for one of the elemental forms of mn , the @xmath5-phase.@xcite hence , it is important to investigate this aspect in mnas , and for this reason we have compared the electronic structure and the spin and orbital moments of mnas using gga and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft - a recent method to take into account electron correlations ) .",
    "@xcite in this calculation we have used the implementation by grechnev _ et .",
    "al_.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ mnasdos ] we compare first the electronic structure from gga calculations with dmft calculations , using a coulomb u ( i.e. the strength of the electron - electron interaction ) of 0 for gga and 2 and 4 ev for dmft . as seen in fig .",
    "[ mnasdos ] one can notice some changes in the electronic structure with the variation of the value of u. the variation in the spin - up dos is more prominent than the spin - down one . however , the resulting exchange splitting does not differ much as discussed below .",
    "next we turn our attention to the spin- ( @xmath92 ) and orbital ( @xmath91 ) moments . from the gga calculation",
    "we obtain for the mn @xmath85-orbital a @xmath92=3.12 @xmath87/atom and a @xmath91=0.026 @xmath87/atom . from dmft calculations for u=2",
    "ev we obtain @xmath92=3.12 @xmath87/atom and @xmath91=0.028 @xmath87/atom , while for u=4  ev we get @xmath92=3.11 @xmath87/atom and @xmath91=0.017 @xmath87/atom . our calculations thus show a rather weak influence on the spin and orbital moments as a function of increasing values of u , implying that electron correlations outside of what is included in gga are not of major importance for mnas . for the gga calculation",
    "we obtain a total moment of 3.13 @xmath87/atom , which should be compared to earlier theoretical results of 3.06  @xmath87/atom @xcite and to the bulk experimental value of 3.45  @xmath87/atom.@xcite",
    "the experimental @xmath106 values for the as - cap and de - cap samples are at least 10 - 15% larger than what has been reported for thin film @xcite or bulk mnas.@xcite values similar to our experimental values were obtained by sanvito and hill @xcite from calculations of the effect of cell volume expansion where a @xmath106@xmath864  @xmath87 was obtained due to the reduction of @xmath107 hybridization when then unit cell was stretched . the necessary increase of the cell volume required almost unphysical values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , but the important observation is the large change in magnetic moment with lattice distortion .",
    "our theoretical results also show that the magnetic properties depend strongly on lattice strain , especially on variations of @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "[ maexch]c . since xrd is a global probe , the measured @xmath7 and @xmath6 correspond to averages over the sample volume and",
    "thus locally the tensile strain could be much larger .",
    "in fact , our saed results , where the size of the selected area is 800 nm , indicate are more strained @xmath7-axis . however , we refrain from depending solely on the tem results since thinning during sample preparation could induce additional lattice strain .",
    "still , changes in @xmath106 and @xmath108 with annealing show that even small relaxations of the structure play a significant role .",
    "our calculated magnetic anisotropy energy and easy axis direction are in good agreement with the experiments .",
    "moreover , the theoretical results suggest that the change in magnetic properties is more sensitive by straining the in - plane axis than the out - of - plane one , an effect which has been attributed to the change in band structures due to strain .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments are observed to vary significantly upon straining the system . following this observation",
    ", one may argue that the experimentally measured large moments may arise from the locally strained regions of the samples . in short ,",
    "our theoretical and experimental results are in line with each other .",
    "in conclusion , our findings indicate a more complex relationship between strain and magnetic properties in mnas films than a simple stretch / compression of the unit cell axes . a strong dependence of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath4 on the angle and fraction of out - of - plane orientation has been established .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations demonstrate a strong dependence of the magnetic properties on the variation of the in - plane axis .",
    "we believe that local structural strains that distort the lattice give rise to the enhanced @xmath81 and mca measured in our samples . the possibility to alter the magnetic properties through controlled film growth with maintained epitaxy gives mnas strong potential as a material for various spintronic applications .",
