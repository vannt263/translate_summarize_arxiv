    "the transfer of genetic material through the membrane surrounding a cell nucleus is fundamental to the understanding of basic cell processes from gene therapy to viral infection .",
    "the motion of linear polymers through pores into confined volumes also arises in many other biological contexts @xcite , perhaps the most common examples of which include the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum , or into mitochondria or chloroplasts .",
    "the export of m - rna through nuclear pore complexes is still another example of great importance . despite the longstanding and widespread interest in this process ,",
    "however , our knowledge about it is still rudimentary .",
    "the process of translocation under influence of an external field or a chemical potential gradient has recently been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "there have also been several theoretical studies which have specifically investigated chain translocation in the presence of binding particles @xcite .",
    "the major role of these binding particles has been recognized as a  brownian ratchet  , a mechanism which was introduced over ten years ago in pioneering work by simon , peskin and oster @xcite .",
    "they happen to have treated the case of protein translocation , but their arguments apply equally well to nucleic acids . to account for translocation rates fast",
    "compared to simple diffusion under a wide variety of conditions and circumstances , they proposed that non - specific binding by globular proteins results in a  \" biased  \"  or  \" ratcheted  \"  motion of the chain .",
    "many experiments confirm that efficient translocation can indeed take place without the involvement of motor proteins .",
    "for example , the entire length ( about 40 microns ) of the dna which comprises the genome of t5 phage is observed to enter its bacterial cell host without requiring metabolic energy @xcite . the experiment of salman _ et al . _ on phage @xmath0 dna shows similarly that translocation of a comparable length of chain can occur without the help of active processes ; simple diffusion would require significantly longer times @xcite .",
    "each of the mechanisms mentioned above for chain translocation , namely diffusion and ratcheting , corresponds to a different time scale and to different physics .",
    "simple diffusion requires a characteristic time @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total length of the polymer and @xmath3 its diffusion coefficient . in the  ratcheting  scenario , as soon as a specific length  @xmath4  of the polymer enters , a protein binds to it and the chain is no longer able to diffuse backwards because the pore size is too small for the dna / protein complex to pass through . in this case , the chain simply diffuses from one binding site to the next , and the translocation time is equal to the product of the time it takes for the chain to diffuse the distance @xmath4 times the number of ratcheting sites @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 , corresponding to a speed - up of the translocation time by a factor of @xmath7 over simple diffusion .",
    "as pointed out by simon , peskin and oster , this time represents an idealized limit in which the ratcheting mechanism functions  \" perfectly  \" ,",
    "i.e. , as each successive binding site passes into the cell it is bound irreversibly by a protein that prohibits the chain from diffusing backwards . in actuality , however , an entering site is not necessarily bound immediately by a protein , and/or the protein does not stay adsorbed long enough to act as a ratchet at that site ; accordingly , the translocation time is increased beyond @xmath8 by a factor that depends on the ratio of on- and off- rates for binding .    in this paper",
    "we consider explicitly the effect of binding particles and show that  via a new mechanism  translocation can occur at rates significantly faster than that provided by the ",
    "perfect  ratcheting scenario described above .",
    "more specifically , we argue that the particles which bind reversibly to the chain give rise to a net force on the chain that pulls it into the cell .",
    "furthermore , this force accounts fully for the translocation process and embraces the different mechanisms mentioned above , _",
    "e.g. _ , in a special limit the brownian ratcheting appears as a particular idealization ( and appealing simplification ) of the effect of such a force .",
    "the magnitude of the force depends in a delicate way on the concentration of the binding particles and on their diffusion coefficient relative to that of the chain . in the overdamped",
    "limit the translocation time in the presence of a force @xmath9 is expected to take the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the friction coefficient of the chain , related to its diffusion constant through the einstein relation @xmath12 .    using brownian molecular dynamics ( bmd ) simulations ,",
    "we calculate separately the average force and the translocation time in the presence of binding particles and find that they do indeed obey the relation @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , the translocation process is force - driven and the translocation time turns out to be longer or shorter than the ideal ratcheting time , depending on the concentration and diffusion coefficient of the binding particles .",
    "these results can be understood in the context of a generalized fokker - planck equation for the probability that at time @xmath14 the chain will have entered the cell to a distance @xmath15 and have @xmath16 particles bound to it .",
    "the drift terms corresponding to chain entry and particle binding are obtained from derivatives with respect to entry distance and binding number of a langmuir adsorption free energy for the overall system . where @xmath17 is the volume fraction of binding particles , @xmath18 their binding energy , and @xmath19 the binding site size . in the limit of large binding energies",
    "@xmath20 one recovers the @xmath21 result discussed in section iv ; otherwise , entropic effects are important as well .",
    "we thank pierre - gilles de gennes for these observations . ]",
    "we find that the binding process involves important non - equilibrium effects in general , on which depends the actual value of the force pulling the chain in , and hence the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "brownian molecular dynamics simulations of a stiff polymer translocating through a pore and into a cell are performed using a coarse - grained model in which the chain is represented by a rigid rod of beads .",
    "the beads are rigidly linked to their nearest neighbors along the chain and do not interact with each other . in this way we model dna as a perfectly straight",
    " rather than the usual semi - flexible  chain , because the focus of our work is on the entering segment of chain which is within a persistence length from the pore .",
    "the link between adjacent beads is rigid in order to avoid chain contraction and extension resulting from the binding of particles ; we also neglect changes in the shape or twist of the chain due to binding .",
    "the distance between monomers along the chain , @xmath23 , corresponds to the `` footprint '' of binding particles in that the center of each bead is considered as an absorbing site .",
    "the binding particles are modeled as spherical , interacting with each other through the repulsive part of a lennard jones ( lj ) potential with diameter @xmath24 ; the interaction between binding particles and chain monomers is treated by a _ full _ ( 12 - 6 ) lj potential . since the distance between the absorbing sites is equal to the diameter of the binding particles , each site can be surrounded by a maximum of six particles .",
    "the cell - particle interactions are taken to vanish for particles within the radius @xmath25 of cell and to increase as @xmath26 for particles at distances greater than @xmath25 from the sphere center .",
    "this potential is simply a convenient way to describe an interior wall .",
    "finally , we treat the pore itself as being completely  inert  , having no effect on the chain except to allow it to enter or leave the cell .",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the chain once one end has been inserted .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the length of chain inside the cell and @xmath27 the position of the @xmath28 th binding particle ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cell ] ) .",

    "@xmath30    here @xmath31 and @xmath9 are the deterministic forces acting on each particle and the rod , respectively , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corresponding random  `` brownian ''  forces satisfying @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the diffusion coefficient of an individual binding particle , related to its friction coefficient , @xmath39 , through the einstein relation @xmath40 . as for the chain",
    ", we introduce an effective diffusion coefficient , @xmath41 which in principle may include all the pore - dna interactions .",
    "since so little is known about these complicated interactions , we have simply taken @xmath42 , consistent with the translational diffusion coefficient of a stiff chain being inversely proportional to its length . in all that follows we use @xmath24 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 as the units of length , energy , and time .",
    "@xmath45 , the lj binding energy between the particles and the monomers , is set equal to @xmath46 ; the diameter of the spherical cell is @xmath47 and the total length of the chain is @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fig : cell ] is a schematic snapshot of the simulated system .",
    "the particles bind predominantly at the tip and then move back along the chain , with particles occasionally adding in empty spaces along the rod ; at the same time , particles leave from other parts of the chain and allow for new particles to bind .",
    "geometrically , up to six particles can sit around each monomer , but just as in the familiar langmuir adsorption problem there are always empty sites on the chain due to entropic factors .",
    "the fact that particles are mostly added at the tip is completely a dynamical effect . under the influence of particle binding ,",
    "the chain is in general moving too fast to allow for saturation of adsorption along its length .",
    "this results in less than the equilibrium number of occupied sites on the chain . in general",
    ", particles bind to the tip of the chain by pushing aside some already attached particles .",
    "however , the force pulling in the chain is exerted mostly at the entering positions where empty binding sites first appear .",
    "figure [ fig : timedens ] shows the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) versus the length of the chain inside the cell , @xmath15 .",
    "mfpt is the average , over a large number of trajectories , of the time it takes for the front tip of the chain to first arrive to the position @xmath49 .",
    "each curve in the figure corresponds to a different value of @xmath50 , the number of binding particles inside the cell .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "there exist different mechanisms for the translocation of the rod under the influence of the binding particles .",
    "if the chain simply diffused into the spherical cell , the mfpt would be equal to @xmath51 corresponding to the length @xmath48 ; see the quadratic function depicted by the heavy solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedens ] . as shown in the figure",
    ", @xmath52 lies significantly above the translocation times we find in our simulations ; even in the presence of only five binding particles , the mfpt is about three times shorter .    the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedens ] represents the time that it would take for the entire chain to enter if there were ratchets functioning perfectly at every absorbing site . in this case",
    ", the chain simply undergoes successive and independent diffusions between neighboring sites , completing each in a time @xmath53 ; the mfpt is equal to the product of this time and the number of steps @xmath54 associated with the entry distance @xmath15 . according to the ratcheting mechanism , then",
    ", the slope of time versus displacement is simply @xmath55 = @xmath56 , for @xmath57 .",
    "the numerical results from our simulations , as well as the theory outlined in the next section , confirm the presence of a quite different translocation mechanism , namely , drift due to a net force exerted on the chain by binding particles .",
    "entry into the cell of successively longer portions of chain `` feeds '' new binding sites into the system ; as each additional particle binds to the chain the free energy of the chain drops , and this reduction gives rise to a force pulling the chain into the cell . in the presence of a constant force , and in the overdamped limit , the corresponding translocation time is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the velocity of the chain .    with competing mechanisms operative , the mfpt will reflect predominantly the one with the smallest translocation time . as already remarked ,",
    "the diffusion time is always much longer than those arising from the other two mechanisms ( see fig . [",
    "fig : timedens ] ) .",
    "however , the ratcheting time could be longer or shorter than that of the force - driven process according to whether the deterministic force @xmath9 is larger or smaller than the `` effective '' brownian ratcheting force .",
    "comparison of the ratcheting velocity of a chain , @xmath60 , with the usual expression for the velocity of a chain under a constant force , @xmath61 , shows that the  effective ",
    "brownian ratcheting force is @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , the ratcheting mechanism is expected to be dominant in the presence of weak enough driving forces .",
    "nevertheless , even in this limit , as we shall see below , the attractive force is operative and completely determines the translocation velocity .",
    "several important observations can be extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig : timedens ] .",
    "the first is that translocation times depend on the number ( concentration ) of binding particles .",
    "this is also true , of course , for the ratcheting mechanism , since higher concentrations of binding particles imply faster `` on - rates '' ( @xmath63 ) , hence higher translocation velocities .",
    "but , as simon , peskin and oster have themselves emphasized , there is a maximum translocation rate corresponding to the limit of large @xmath64 . this maximum rate  or minimum time , @xmath65  also corresponds to the smallest distance ( @xmath24 in the present model ) between ratcheting ( binding ) sites . from fig .",
    "[ fig : timedens ] we see that the translocation occurs even faster than the limiting ratcheting prediction when the number of binding particles exceeds @xmath66 .",
    "this result suggests that an additional mechanism is operative , which we show is associated with a net force acting on the chain along its direction of motion .",
    "more explicitly , the slope of mfpt _ vs _",
    "@xmath15 plots reveals that the average velocity of the chain , @xmath67 , remains almost constant throughout the translocation process ( except right at the beginning and towards the end ) . from the relation @xmath68 one",
    "expects that the average force on the chain also stays constant during this process , in which case the slope of time @xmath14 versus @xmath69 will be almost the same as that of mfpt versus @xmath15 iff @xmath70 , which satisfies the backward fokker - planck equation with a reflecting boundary condition at the hole and an absorbing boundary condition at @xmath15 .",
    "the solution to the backward fokker - planck equation in the presence of a constant force @xmath71 is @xmath72 . if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 . in the other limiting case , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath75 , then @xmath76 . ] . using @xmath77 , we calculated the effective force on the chain from the velocity obtained in our mfpt _ vs _ length curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timedens ] ) . specifically , we calculated the average velocity of the chain over the range @xmath78 to @xmath79 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the region where the mfpt versus @xmath49 curves are almost linear ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : timedens ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we can also determine the force acting on the chain directly from the simulations .",
    "the squares in fig . [ fig : force60 ] represent the average force exerted on the chain by the binding particles ( coarse - grained over @xmath24 ) , as a function of the length inside .",
    "this force is seen to be nearly constant ; furthermore , it is found to agree within numerical uncertainty , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] , with the force calculated ( as described above ) from the average velocity ( _ i.e. _ , the inverse slope in fig.[fig : timedens ] ) for all the values of @xmath80 ( up to 300 ) that we treated .    for @xmath81 , where the forces are of the order of unity or smaller ( i.e. , smaller than the `` effective '' brownian ratchet force @xmath82 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : timedens ] shows that the translocation times begin to be significantly smaller than the perfect ratcheting limit .",
    "this scenario is in principle embodied in the basic result of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the translocation time is written as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the ideal ratcheting time and @xmath85 is the effective strength of binding , expressed as a ratio of  on  and `` off '' rates .",
    "@xmath86 corresponds to saturated binding and to ideal ratcheting ; otherwise , the ratchet mechanism becomes less efficient and the translocation times are longer than @xmath87 .",
    "it is notable that even in this weak force situation , where one expects the ratcheting mechanism to dominate , we still observe a force - controlled translocation ( _ i.e. , _ the translocation time is still determined by the force pulling the chain in , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "the reason is that these weaker forces correspond to smaller numbers of less strongly bound particles , and hence also to less efficient ratcheting .",
    "the translocation process simulated above can be described theoretically using a simplified dynamical model .",
    "the two relevant variables are the length of the chain @xmath15 inside the cell and the number of particles @xmath88 attached to the chain .",

    "we consider the dynamics of translocation as a coupled diffusion process involving both the @xmath15 and @xmath88 degrees of freedom .",
    "using mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( mnet ) @xcite , one can derive the fokker - planck equation governing the time - dependent probability density @xmath95 that at time @xmath14 a length @xmath15 of the chain has passed through the hole and has @xmath88 particles attached to it :    @xmath96    note that there is a drift and a diffusion term for each of the @xmath15 and @xmath88 variables .",

    "the fokker - planck eq .",

    "however , a simpler description can be achieved by considering the possibility of time scale separation .",
    "the characteristic times for the entry and the binding processes scale as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "if the binding process is very fast compared to the chain entry ( i.e. @xmath108 ) , it is reasonable to assume that the `` fast '' variable  here the number of attached particles , @xmath88  will decay very rapidly to its equilibrium distribution . in this case",
    "the process can be described by the evolution of the slow variable , the position @xmath15 of the chain .",

    "the resulting one dimensional fokker - planck equation is    @xmath109    where    @xmath110    is the average driving force .",

    "the present work has attempted to provide a basic theoretical framework for treating the translocation dynamics of a stiff chain as it moves into a cell containing particles which interact attractively with it and bind to it .",
    "we conclude that this process is in general _ force_-controlled . obviously , _",
    "pure _ diffusion occurs only in the absence of any binding particles ; and the _ rectification _ of diffusion which is the essence of the brownian ratcheting mechanism appears as a manifestation of the binding force in a special limit of interaction potentials and particle concentration .    to examine the extent to which the simple brownian ratchet mechanism can account for chain translocation due to binding particles , we have performed several simulations using different values for @xmath4 , the distance between binding sites .",
    "we varied @xmath4 from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , _",

    "when @xmath4 is sufficiently larger than the range of interaction  say for @xmath126  we find that the chain performs a cycle of drift and diffusion movements .",
    "as an absorbing site enters the cell the chain is first pulled by the attractive force acting on the binding site , and then diffuses between adsorbing sites , during which time no net force is acting on the chain . in this case , the effect of the binding force is twofold : it pulls the chain in the region where it is acting , and also impedes its backwards diffusion . in the limit where the range of the force is small compared to the distance between sites , the contribution of the drift to the translocation is negligible , but nevertheless the force is still rectifying the diffusion . in these circumstances ,",
    "the effect of the force can be most simply described by the brownian ratchet idea .",
    "specifically , the rectification arises from the free energy penalty for moving an absorbing site out of the cell ( as provided approximately by our langmuir adsorption model ) .",
    "the efficiency of the rectification depends on the ratio of free energy penalty to the thermal energy @xmath43 .",
    "we have also found that the effective force can be significantly ( several times ) smaller than the value one would estimate from a quasi - equilibrium treatment of the binding and entry dynamics , i.e. , from assuming that the time scale for particles to diffuse and bind is much shorter than that for chain entry .",
    "more explicitly , only if we increase sufficiently the friction coefficient of the chain do we find agreement between the force calculated from the simulations and that obtained from the quasi - equilibrium solution to the coupled entry / binding fokker - planck equation .",
    "this result indicates that there can be significant differences between the _ stalling _ force measured in single - molecule experiments and the actual _ value _ of the force during the process of translocation .    in summary , as established directly from our bmd simulations , we find that chain translocation can be understood in terms of the pulling force arising from particle binding .",
    "moreover , this mechanism leads to translocation times that can become distinctly smaller than ratcheting .",
    "by decreasing the diffusion coefficient of the chain relative to that of the binding particles , the simulations give a still larger effective force pulling the chain along its length into the cell .",
    "the maximum value of this force , attainable in the limit @xmath127 and @xmath128 is precisely @xmath129 , _",
    "i.e. _ the drop in free energy per unit length when all binding sites are occupied . these results",
    "are nicely confirmed by solving directly a coupled fokker - planck equation for the chain entry and particle binding dynamics .",
