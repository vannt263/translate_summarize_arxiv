    "recently observed astronomical phenomena have revolutionized the understanding of cosmology .",

    "this acceleration is observed at a very small red - shift showing that it is a recent phenomenon in the late universe .",
    "observations of @xmath14 type ia supernovae made by hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite modified earlier astronomical results and provided conclusive evidence for deceleration prior to cosmic acceleration caused by dark energy in the recent past .",
    "the acceleration is realized with negative pressure and positive energy density that violates strong energy condition ( sec ) @xcite .",
    "this violation of sec gives reverse gravitational effect . due to this effect",
    ", universe gets a jerk and transition from deceleration to acceleration takes place . phantom energy has appeared as a potential dark energy candidate in this arena , which violates both weak and strong energy conditions @xcite .",
    "these data suggest @xmath15 content of the universe in the form of dark energy ( de ) , @xmath16 in the form of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) and the rest @xmath17 in the form of baryonic matter as well as radiation .",
    "+    it is an irony of nature and is a puzzling phenomenon that most abundant form of matter - energy in the universe is most mysterious .",
    "the simplest dark energy candidate is the cosmological constant @xmath18 , but it needs to be extremely fine - tuned to satisfy the current value of the dark energy . alternatively , to explain decay of the density , many dynamic models have been suggested , where @xmath18 varies slowly with cosmic time ( t ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to models with dynamic @xmath19 , many hydrodynamic models with or without dissipative pressure have been proposed in which barotropic fluid is the source of dark energy @xcite .",
    "chaplygin gas as well as generalized chaplygin gas have also been considered as possible dark energy sources due to negative pressure @xcite .",
    "other than these approaches , some authors have considered modified gravitational action by adding a function @xmath20 ( r being the ricci scalar curvature ) to einstein - hilbert lagrangian , where @xmath20 provides a gravitational alternative for dark energy causing late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "a review on modified gravity as an alternative to dark energy is available in @xcite .",
    "a more comprehensive review is provided in @xcite .",
    "all these models are phenomenological in the sense that an idea of dark energy is introduced _ a priori _ either in term of gravitational field or non - gravitational field . in spite of these attempts , still cosmic acceleration is a challenge .",
    "+    dark energy and the accelerated expansion of the universe have been the direct prediction of the distant supernovae ia observations which are also supported , indirectly , by the observations of the cmb anistropies , gravitational lensing and the studies of galaxy clusters .",
    "it is generally believed that the distant sne ia observations predict an accelerating expansion of the universe powered by some hypothetical source with negative pressure generally termed as ` dark energy ' .",
    "supernovae at relatively high red shift are found fainter than that predicted for an earlier - thought slowing - expansion and indicate that expansion of universe is actually speeding up @xcite .",

    "the authors propose a novel model for genesis of dark energy , indicating its origin in nucleus and suggesting that it is the released - free nuclear binding energy of cosmos which manifests itself as dark energy causing negative pressure and repulsive gravity in the universe .",
    "it explains why for dark energy @xmath205 at release time and @xmath73 at present time .",
    "also , the model describes the biography of the dark energy and tells that @xmath26 begins with a close - to zero value , remains low as necessary till galaxy formation say at @xmath77 , @xmath78 ; transition at @xmath133 , @xmath139 and becomes dominant at present time @xmath11 , @xmath1 satisfying very well all the astrophysical constraints .",
    "the authors also propose a modified - method to estimate deceleration parameter and find that with the proposed model @xmath191 in reasonable agreement with known observed value .",

    "<S> recent observations on type - ia supernovae and low density ( @xmath0 ) measurement of matter including dark matter suggest that the present - day universe consists mainly of repulsive - gravity type ` exotic matter ' with negative - pressure often said ` dark energy ' ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> but the nature of dark energy is mysterious and its puzzling questions , such as why , how , where and when about the dark energy , are intriguing . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> the authors attempt to answer these questions while making an effort to reveal the genesis of dark energy and suggest that ` the cosmological nuclear binding energy liberated during primordial nucleo - synthesis remains trapped for a long time and then is released free which manifests itself as dark energy in the universe ' . </S>",
    "<S> it is also explained why for dark energy the parameter @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> noting that @xmath3 for stiff matter and @xmath4 for radiation ; @xmath5 is for dark energy because @xmath6 is due to ` deficiency of stiff - nuclear - matter ' and that this binding energy is ultimately released as ` radiation ' contributing @xmath7 , making @xmath8 . when dark energy is released free at @xmath9 , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> but as on present day at @xmath11 when radiation strength has diminished to @xmath12 , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this , thus almost solves the dark - energy mystery of negative pressure and repulsive - gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed theory makes several estimates /predictions which agree reasonably well with the astrophysical constraints and observations . </S>",
    "<S> though there are many candidate - theories , the proposed model of this paper presents an entirely new approach ( cosmological nuclear energy ) as a possible candidate for dark energy .     </S>",
