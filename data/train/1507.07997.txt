    "bootstrap percolation on lattices has been extensively investigated in the last decades , and recently it has been considered on the classical erds - rnyi random graph @xmath7 as well @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a stochastic process of activation propagation over the random graph which combines lattice @xmath8 with additional random edges that depend on the distance between vertices .",
    "a similar graph has been studied , by , e.g. , aizenman , kesten and newman @xcite - the so - called long - range percolation graph . in that model",
    "a pair of sites of @xmath3-dimensional lattice @xmath9 is connected ( or a bond is occupied ) with probability that depends on the graph distance . in this paper",
    "we change the way probabilities are defined to get a sparser graph with respect to long edges .",
    "the @xmath10-cycle long - range percolation graph ( a cycle lattice with @xmath10 vertices ) was considered in @xcite where the probabilities of random edges decay polynomially as their distances increase .",
    "it was shown that the diameter of this graph is of the order of @xmath11 , assuming that the parameters are constrained to a certain parameter region .",
    "the combination of a @xmath3-dimensional grid with certain random edges ( decreasing in distance ) was considered by coppersmith , gamarnik and sviridenko @xcite .",
    "they showed that under certain conditions on the dimension and probability @xmath12 , the diameter is either @xmath13 or @xmath14 , where the power coefficient @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "bollobs and chung @xcite investigated the combination of an @xmath10-cycle with a random matching .",
    "clearly , the @xmath10-cycle has diameter @xmath17 .",
    "however , a random matching reduces the diameter drastically and it becomes @xmath18 .",
    "later , watts and strogatz @xcite introduced the _ `` small world '' _ model on the vertex set of the @xmath10-cycle , where the edges are _ rewired _ at random with probability @xmath12 , starting from a circle lattice with @xmath10 vertices and @xmath19 edges per vertex .",
    "this construction allows to tune the graph between regularity ( @xmath20 ) and disorder ( @xmath21 ) . a different version of the _ `` small world '' _",
    "model has been described by newman and watts @xcite . here , again an @xmath10-cycle was considered and the edges of the cycle were fixed .",
    "in contrast to the original formulation @xcite , however , in @xcite random edges were added with some probability instead of rewiring the edges of the cycle .",
    "this approach results in a smaller diameter for a given graph size .",
    "there has been a lot of interest in studying scaling behavior and phase transitions in inhomogeneous random graph models , see , for example @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a theory of bootstrap percolation has been developed on @xmath7 regarding the size @xmath22 of the set of initially active sites .",
    "results include sharp threshold for phase transition for parameters @xmath12 and @xmath22 , and results for the time @xmath23 required to the termination of the bootstrap percolation process .    recently , turova and vallier @xcite considered bootstrap percolation on the combination of the lattice @xmath24 and the random graph @xmath7 , where the edges of @xmath24 and @xmath7 are selected with probability @xmath25 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "sharp threshold for phase transition was derived .",
    "the authors got asymptotic results for the time when the bootstrap percolation process stops .    here",
    "we consider a random graph @xmath26 that is built as follows .",
    "we start with the @xmath8 lattice over a @xmath27 grid ; for the sake of simplicity we assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , we have a torus @xmath28 , with the short notation @xmath29 .",
    "the set of vertices of @xmath26 consists of all vertices of @xmath29 , in total @xmath30 vertices .",
    "all the edges from the torus @xmath29 are included in the graph @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we introduce random edges as follows . for every pair of vertices we assign an edge with probability that depends on the graph distance @xmath3 between the two vertices , i.e.",
    ", @xmath3 is the length of the shortest path between the given pair of vertices in the torus grid .",
    "accordingly , the probability of a long edge is described as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath5 and @xmath32 are positive constants , @xmath33 ( no multiple edges are allowed between any pair of vertices ) and @xmath34 is large enough so that each @xmath35 .",
    "we assume @xmath36 throughout this study .",
    "we will denote this model the @xmath0 graph .",
    "the edges of the torus are called _ short edges _ , while the randomly added ones are called _",
    "long edges_.    the model introduced in this paper is also motivated by the structure and operation of the neuropil , the densely connected neural tissue of the cortex @xcite .",
    "the human brain has about @xmath37 neurons .",
    "typically , a neuron has several thousands of connections to other neurons through synapses , thus the human brain has @xmath38 synaptic connections .",
    "most of the connections are short and limited to the neuron s direct neighborhood ( in some metric ) , forming the so - called the _",
    "dendritic arbor_. in addition , the neurons have a few long connections ( axons ) , which extend further away from their cell body . in general , there are several thousands short connections in the dendritic arbor for one distant connection represented by a long axon .",
    "we use @xmath0 to model the combined effect of mostly short connections and a few long connections .",
    "it is more likely to have in brains shorter connections than longer ones , which is a fact captured in the definition of @xmath39 , as @xmath39 is decreasing in the graph distance @xmath3 .",
    "there are two types of neurons in the brain , namely excitatory and inhibitory ones .",
    "the type of a neuron describes the function of the neuron in the brain , e.g. , excitatory ( inhibitory ) neurons excite ( inhibit ) the neurons to which they are connected .",
    "it is known that there are much more excitatory neurons than inhibitory neurons in the cortex ; the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory neurons is typically @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "based on neuroscience studies it is expected that pure excitatory populations can maintain non - zero background activation level , while interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations are able to produce limit cycle oscillations @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on conditions required to sustain non - zero activity level in pure excitatory network .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : first we describe some properties of the introduced random graph @xmath0 .",
    "we derive bounds on the diameter of this graph and describe its degree distribution .",
    "the second part of this paper is devoted to the study of activation processes . to simplify the mathematical treatment we analyze the activation as a stochastic process in mean - field approximation @xcite , for which we derive conditions for phase transitions in the presence of single type of ( excitatory ) nodes .",
    "activity propagation in graphs with two types of nodes ( excitatory and inhibitory ) is the objective of future studies @xcite .",
    "we will use the following standard notation ; for non - negative sequences @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 if @xmath44 holds for some constant @xmath45 and every @xmath46 ; @xmath47 if both @xmath43 and @xmath48 hold ; @xmath49 if @xmath50 ; @xmath51 if @xmath52 . a sequence of events @xmath53 occurs with high probability , _ whp _ , if the probability @xmath54 .",
    "first notice that the expected number of long edges @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "[ edgeexp ]    @xmath56,i.e.,@xmath57 .",
    "indeed , the number of vertices @xmath58 in @xmath29 which are exactly at distance @xmath3 from a fixed vertex is @xmath59 for @xmath34 odd , and @xmath60 for @xmath34 even .",
    "the number of pairs of vertices in @xmath29 having distance @xmath3 is @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath34 odd @xmath62    for @xmath34 even a similar computation gives the same result .",
    "the degree distribution of a vertex @xmath63 with respect to long edges can be approximated by poisson distribution .",
    "let @xmath64 be the random variable describing the degree of a particular vertex @xmath65 considering long edges only .",
    "then clearly , the degree of a vertex @xmath63 considering the short edges , too , is @xmath66 .",
    "[ lemmapoisappr ] the probability that a vertex has degree @xmath19 considering only the long edges is given by @xmath67 the total variation distance @xmath68 where the random variable @xmath69 has poisson distribution po@xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "the probability of the event @xmath72 that a vertex has @xmath73 edges of length @xmath74 is clearly @xmath75 therefore , the probability that a vertex has degree exactly @xmath19 is @xmath76    the last expression is not very convenient to use .",
    "however , a standard poisson approximation can be given using le cam s argument @xcite , see also e.g.  @xcite . pick an arbitrary vertex @xmath65 and let enumerate the other @xmath77 vertices by @xmath78 , @xmath79 , excluding the nearest neighbors , i.e. , vertices at distance 1 .",
    "the long edges that connect the vertex @xmath65 to other vertices of the graph are independent 01 random variables with bernoulli be@xmath80 distribution . in other words , let @xmath81 be the event that there is an edge between vertices @xmath65 and @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 may in general vary for different @xmath74 .",
    "consider now the degree @xmath86 of the vertex @xmath65 .",

    "( [ degree ] ) each term satisfies @xmath91 .",
    "next we show that the addition of long edges to the torus grid reduces significantly ( from linear to logarithmic in the number of vertices ) its diameter .",
    "there exist constants @xmath92 , which depend on @xmath5 only , such that for the diameter @xmath93 the following hold . @xmath94",
    "the lower bound is trivial .",
    "the expected degree @xmath95 of a vertex @xmath65 by claim  [ edgeexp ] is a constant @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the expected number of vertices @xmath97 we can reach in at most @xmath98 steps from a given vertex @xmath65 is less than or equal to @xmath99 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "this is less than @xmath101 , and thus , by markov s inequality , @xmath102 if we choose @xmath103 with @xmath104 sufficiently small , the probability in eq .",
    "( [ dlower ] ) tends to zero , i.e. , even from a given vertex @xmath65 we can not reach all vertices within distance @xmath105 . hence , @xmath105 bounds the diameter from below .    to prove the upper bound , partition the vertices of @xmath0 into consecutive @xmath106 blocks @xmath107 , where @xmath19 is a constant @xmath108 to be chosen later .",
    "( for simplicity , we will assume that everywhere divisibility holds during the proof ; otherwise we let some blocks be @xmath109 . )",
    "define the graph @xmath110 as follows .",
    "the vertices are the blocks , and two blocks @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 are connected iff there is a long edge from a vertex of @xmath111 to a vertex of @xmath112 in @xmath0 .",

    "the proof is finished .",
    "now we introduce a stochastic process on the graph we have just built .",
    "each vertex is described by two variables , namely , the _ type _ of the vertex and its _ state_. the _ type _ of the vertex is either excitatory ( @xmath156 ) or inhibitory ( @xmath157 ) .",

    "the evolution rule is @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 denote the subsets of vertices in the closed neighborhood of the vertex @xmath65 , of type @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively ; and @xmath172 is the indicator function . here",
    "@xmath19 is a nonnegative integer that specifies a threshold required for the node to be in the active state . for a vertex @xmath65 of type @xmath157 ,",
    "the following rule holds : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the closed neighborhood of vertex @xmath65 .",
    "notice , that vertices of type @xmath156 and @xmath157 have different roles and influence each other differently .",
    "observe , that the set of active vertices does not necessarily grow monotonically during the activation process even in the absence of nodes of type @xmath157 , whereas monotonicity is typically assumed in most bootstrap percolation models . in this paper",
    "we focus on activation processes having only type @xmath156 vertices . in this case , according to eq .",
    "( [ dynamics ] ) we have the @xmath19-rule , i.e. , a vertex will be active at the next time step if it has at least @xmath19 active neighbors including itself .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath19 is not greater than @xmath175 in the present study .",
    "notice that if there are only local edges , the case @xmath176 yields _ bootstrap percolation _ with majority rule .",
    "the choice of small @xmath19 is motivated by the fact that there are vertices with degree @xmath177 with positive probability .",
    "therefore , if @xmath19 could be @xmath178 or more , then there would be vertices that can not become active unless they were activated at the beginning .",
    "as we mentioned above , we assume that there is only one type of nodes ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "moreover , for simplicity , we consider here the _ mean - field _ ( mf )",
    "approximation of the model .",
    "the mean - field approximation assumes that the activation and degrees of the various nodes are well - mixed ; hence we ignore any dependencies between activation and vertex degrees , as well as any dependencies between the state of a vertex and the state of its neighbors @xcite .",
    "effectively , we sample a new set of neighbors at each step .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the mf approximation does not depend on the topology of the torus but only on the degree distribution and on the cardinality of @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the transition probabilities from one state to another depend only on the number of active nodes .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the vertices are activated independently of each other , ignoring the small dependencies between degrees and activities for different vertices .",

    "the mean - field analysis is an analytical approach of finding phase transitions in the stochastic process by averaging the system over space .",
    "thus , the mean - field model reduces the analysis of a system with distributed components to a system with a single component .",
    "let @xmath181 denote the conditional mean of @xmath182 given @xmath183 , for the mean - field approximation .",
    "the main task of the mean - field approximation is to find solutions to the _ fixed - point equation _ @xmath184 , where the solutions of this equation are called fixed points .",
    "this approach is based on the observation that the critical behavior of the original system often occurs near the unstable fixed points of mean - field model @xcite . for a discrete time",
    "dynamical system , a fixed point is called stable if it attracts all the trajectories that start from some neighborhood of the fixed point .",
    "otherwise , a fixed point is unstable .",
    "if @xmath185 is continuously differentiable in an open neighborhood of a fixed point @xmath137 , a sufficient condition for @xmath137 to be stable or unstable is @xmath186 or @xmath187 , respectively ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath188 be a binomial random variable .",
    "then the density @xmath183 in the mean - field model satisfies the following stochastic recursion .",

    "the activation of a vertex is deterministic given the number of active vertices in the closed neighborhood .",
