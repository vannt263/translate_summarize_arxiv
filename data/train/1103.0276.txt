    "narrow emission lines associated with nuclear activity can be distinguished from lines caused by star formation by studying the line ratios @xcite .",
    "the line ratio diagnostics work because the `` harder '' emission of an agn is more efficient at ionizing the surrounding gas and dust than star formation , and thus agns have stronger lines from high - energy forbidden transitions ( e.g. ,  @xmath65007  and  @xmath66583 ) relative to the lower - energy hydrogen transitions ( e.g. ,  @xmath64861  and  @xmath66563 ) .",

    "the best evidence for this scenario is the observation that some type 2 agns have a `` hidden '' blr revealed by spectropolarimetry @xcite .",

    "an extremely blue , uv - emitting host would cause us to overestimate the accretion disk emission and consequently overestimate the accretion rate .",

    "in addition , restricting our fitting to @xmath91  ev ( @xmath92   ) already means that a normal elliptical galaxy ( like our `` ell2 '' template ) contributes very little flux where we fit the accretion disk .    while broad - line agns are likely to have some host contribution , we can not use surface brightness fitting to estimate their host luminosity because they are at high redshift and their point source overwhelms their extended emission @xcite .",
    "however at the peak of the accretion disk emission for a broad - line agn ( @xmath94 , or 4  ev ) the host galaxy contributes @xmath95% of the emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we shift the observed ( and host - subtracted , for narrow - line and lineless agns ) photometry to the rest - frame from the measured spectroscopic redshift and convert the magnitudes or fluxes to luminosities .",

    "we choose 250 kev as an intermediate value , although any cutoff from 50 - 500 kev does not greatly influence our results .",
    "our agns have typically flat x - ray spectra with @xmath100 , and so changing the x - ray cutoff energy by a factor of 0.2 - 2 effectively changes the integrated x - ray luminosity by the same factor of a few . because the x - ray and disk luminosities are roughly comparable ( see figure [ fig : sedfits ] ) , this results in less than a factor of two change in the total accretion luminosity : much less than the @xmath70.5  dex errors we compute for our estimated @xmath56 ( see  3.3 ) .",

    "note that the relation @xmath109 above means that the disk temperature is constrained not only by the photometry by also by the black hole mass . in practice",
    "this prevents our fits from resulting in unphysically hot accretion disks , since disks peaking at energies much higher than @xmath74  ev ( 3000 ) would require unphysically small black hole masses .",

    "there is good evidence that the outer edge of the blr coincides with the inner edge of the clumpy dust @xcite .",
    "some authors additionally suggest that the blr and the clumpy dust `` torus '' are two components of the same wind driven off the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the clumpy dust wind emerges from the disk at a similar radius to that calculated in section 4.1 , then we would expect the ir power - law signature to disappear at @xmath249 , just as the blr disappears .",
    "however many narrow - line agns with @xmath249 still have the negative ir power - law slopes , suggesting that there must be another source of mid - ir emission .",
    "either there is a distant source of clumpy dust beyond the expanding riaf , or there is mid - ir synchrotron emission in the riaf region at the base of the radio jet ( as observed by * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : cartoonmodel ] presents a simple schematic outlining the changes in agns from high ( @xmath254 ) to low ( @xmath249 ) accretion rate . at the top is a broad - line agn with high accretion rate ( @xmath255 ) . at these high accretion rates",
    "the gas and dust falling into the black hole forms a thin accretion disk and a disk wind originates at @xmath256 .",
    "the broad emission lines are emitted in stratified regions along this wind based on the radiation pressure ( which ionizes and excites the wind material ) , with @xmath125 and high ionization lines ( e.g. , ) emitted from nearer radii than low ionization lines ( e.g. , ) @xcite . at higher radii , the disk wind forms clumpy dust @xcite .",
    "this dusty `` torus '' can obscure the agn along lines of sight near the disk , causing an observer to see an obscured narrow - line agn @xcite .",
    "the bottom of figure [ fig : cartoonmodel ] shows an agn with low accretion rate ( @xmath257 ) , characteristic of the unobscured narrow - line and lineless agns in our sample .",
    "the onset of a geometrically thick riaf changes the picture dramatically .",
    "because the disk wind radius is within the riaf , there are no broad emission lines .",
    "instead the dominant outflow is a radio jet , and agns with low accretion rates and riafs are typically more radio luminous than broad - line agns .",
    "the lack of a disk wind also means that there is not the typical clumpy dust `` torus '' seen in broad - line agns .",
    "however we can not rule out the presence of dust completely , as clumpy dust may come from another source besides the disk wind and some @xmath183 have the ir signature of hot dust .",
    "the multiwavelength data of cosmos provide many diagnostic capabilities , and we have argued that decreasing accretion rates lead to the onset of a riaf at @xmath258 and subsequently stronger radio jets , a weaker torus , and the disappearance of broad emission lines .",
    "the onset of a riaf also makes several predictions testable by future observations .",
    "in addition the simple model in section 5 can be more fully constrained by additional investigations .",
    "if the broad - line region is truly disappearing at @xmath258 then we would expect spectropolarimetry to reveal reflected broad emission lines in only high accretion rate ( @xmath259 ) narrow - line and lineless agns .",
    "spectropolarimetry of nearby agns shows a dichotomy based on accretion rate , although most authors place the change from hidden broad lines to `` true '' type 2 agn at @xmath260 @xcite .",
    "most likely , the difference results from the uncertain bolometric corrections used in these previous works , compared to the full modeled seds used here .",
    "mid - ir broad - band polarimetry could determine the cause of the negative ir power - law slopes in @xmath258 agns .",
    "if the clumpy dust `` torus '' is associated with the same wind that drives the broad line region , it should disappear in these objects .",
    "the mid - ir signature might instead be synchrotron radiation in the riaf at the base of the jet , which would appear polarized at the @xmath261 level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if no polarization is detected , then we must conclude that clumpy dust exists at higher radii than the blr disk - wind , beyond the riaf region of @xmath258 agns .",
    "it is very difficult to measure accretion rates of partially or fully obscured agns , and such objects are generally missed by the x - ray and optical limits of this study .",
    "however we do make a few predictions for the accretion rates of various agns .",
    "if the torus is part of a disk - wind that vanishes at @xmath258 , then torus - obscured agns of the classical @xcite unified model will have only high accretion rates ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "obscuration by cooler dust associated with host galaxy star formation , as predicted by the observed redshift evolution in the narrow - line / broad - line agn ratio @xcite , could conceivably be present at any accretion rate ( although it may be limited by the ability of the dusty star formation to feed the black hole , * ? ? ?",
    "we might then expect that obscured agns with a strong mid - ir torus signature should have @xmath259 , while agns obscured by the cooler dust associated with host galaxy star formation might have a wider range of accretion rates .",
