    "the possibility of studying nonperturbatively on the lattice gauge - dependent quantities provides in principle a unique tool to test qcd at the level of the basic fields entering the continuum lagrangian . from this point of view , the gluon propagator in the pure glue theory is perhaps the simplest quantity . from its study one",
    "expects to obtain among other things a better understanding of the infrared behavior of the theory and of the mechanism of gluon confinement . as a result",
    "we may also hope to acquire a better understanding of the hadronization phenomena and of the glueball spectrum @xcite .",
    "let us first review what is known from perturbation theory : consider the expression ( in minkowski space - time ) @xmath12 \\ | { \\rm o } \\rangle \\ e^{i k \\cdot x}\\ ] ] from the faddeev - popov quantization in a class of covariant gauges one gets the simple slavnov identity @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gauge parameter . from lorentz covariance , the general solution to ( [ eq : sla ] ) can be written as @xmath15 { 1 \\over k^2}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : sla ] ) implies that the longitudinal part of the propagator gets trivially renormalized , so that the vacuum polarization @xmath16 just renormalizes the transverse propagator . the renormalization constant @xmath17 for the gauge fields ,",
    "@xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an ultraviolet cut - off and @xmath21 is a spacelike value of the momentum . in general @xmath17 is gauge dependent .",
    "one can then rewrite the unrenormalized transverse gluon propagator as @xmath22    unlike qed , in qcd we know from the properties of the @xmath23-function that perturbation theory can only be applied to the study of the large-@xmath24 behavior of green s functions . in such a region one",
    "gets at the 1-loop level @xcite @xmath25 in general , at each order in @xmath26 perturbative corrections depend logarithmically in @xmath27 , so that in the deep euclidean region ( @xmath28 ) gluon propagators behave essentially in the same way as the photon propagators , as long as one considers a finite order in perturbation theory .    in the infrared region things are probably different .",
    "in fact , in the simpler qed case perturbation theory is still reliable , and one can evaluate order by order the vacuum polarization function . in particular , one finds that @xmath29 is finite if all the fermions are massive ( we omit from now on the explicit @xmath30dependence of vacuum polarization functions ) .",
    "this implies that the @xmath31 pole of the free photon propagator is still present after radiative corrections are taken into account , so that the photon remains a massless particle .",
    "such corrections only affect the residue at the pole , resulting in charge renormalization .",
    "on the other hand , consider qcd without quarks .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian does not contain any mass scale in 4 dimensions , yet if the theory is confining a mass scale must be dynamically generated in some way , since the confinement potential @xmath32 contains such a scale .",
    "such a mass @xmath33 can not be generated in perturbation theory , since it must satisfy @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a renormalization scale @xmath35 . for small @xmath36",
    ", one has @xmath37",
    "\\qquad   { \\rm when }   \\ g \\rightarrow 0\\ ] ] so that @xmath38 has an essential singularity at @xmath39 .",
    "such a mass scale may show up in the vacuum polarization function for the gluon .",
    "indeed , while contributions to @xmath40 proportional to finite powers of @xmath36 have for large @xmath24 a logarithmic momentum dependence , non - perturbative effects may generate terms in @xmath40 proportional to _ negative _ powers of the squared 4-momentum , for instance @xmath41 where @xmath42 have the dimension of a mass and depend nonanalytically on @xmath36 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath43 gives rise to a mass pole in the gluon propagator and corresponds to the standard schwinger mechanism @xcite .    in",
    "the above formula @xmath44 denotes contributions which can be represented as a power series in @xmath26 .",
    "such series , when truncated to a finite order in @xmath26 , behave like polynomials in @xmath45 for large @xmath24 . on the other hand",
    ", the sum of the contributions to all orders in @xmath26 can generate an anomalous dimension @xmath7 @xcite ; in such a case for @xmath46 the propagator behaves like @xmath47 .",
    "the nonperturbative behavior of the euclidean gluon propagator has been investigated in the continuum by many authors with different methods and in different gauges @xcite . in some of these attempts",
    "a very singular gluon propagator was found , behaving like @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 @xcite , and a confining property was inferred from such behavior . on the other hand , other work points towards the elimination at the non - perturbative level of the singularity at @xmath50 of the propagator @xcite , as a consequence of dynamical mass generation .",
    "in particular , a very peculiar momentum dependence , consistent with the above scenario , has been predicted as arising from a modification of the standard path integral faddeev - popov formula in the landau gauge by the introduction of a nonperturbative gauge - fixing procedure @xcite",
    ". such improved implementation of the landau gauge is expressed by the equations @xmath51 > 0 \\label{eq : gauge}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 $ ] is the faddeev - popov operator in the landau gauge , which in general is not positive definite . the positivity requirement in ( [ eq : gauge ] ) can be seen as a recipe to get rid ( although not completely @xcite ) of gribov copies @xcite . in the gauge ( [ eq : gauge ] ) , the ( transverse ) gluon propagator in momentum space has been argued to be of the form @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath5 is a dynamically generated mass scale .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) corresponds to the case @xmath54 in ( [ eq : pola ] ) .",
    "it implies that in the continuum @xmath55 remarkably , the same predictions were also obtained in the study of schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "the above expression lends itself to intriguing speculations : the absence of any particle singularity on the real @xmath24 axis predicts the absence of an asymptotic gluon state .",
    "it may describe a short - lived excitation , giving rise to a gluon jet . in this framework",
    ", the mass scale @xmath5 appearing in the above formulas may perhaps be interpreted as a hadronization scale .",
    "the lattice gluon field can be defined as @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the lattice spacing .",
    "thus the lattice gluon propagator in @xmath58-space is the expectation value of : @xmath59    an important point is that on the lattice one can define and implement the analogue of the gauge condition ( [ eq : gauge ] ) .",
    "in fact , given any link configuration @xmath60 , one can define a function of the gauge transformations @xmath36 on @xmath60 @xmath61 \\equiv - { 1 \\over v } \\sum_{n , \\mu } \\ re \\ tr \\ \\left ( u_{\\mu}^{g }",

    "an iterative minimization of @xmath65 $ ] obtained by performing suitable gauge transformations generates a configuration @xmath66 which satisfies the lattice version of ( [ eq : gauge ] ) , defined in terms of a lattice faddeev - popov operator @xcite .",

    "\\over \\delta g_{1 } \\",
    "\\delta g_{2}}$ ] . as we have already mentioned for the continuum ,",
    "such a gauge is not completely free of gribov copies .",
    "this is also true on the lattice , and corresponds to the fact that for a fixed configuration @xmath60 the function ( [ eq : effecl ] ) may have several local minima ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in general",
    ", zwanziger @xcite showed that on the lattice one has qualitatively the same scenario for the landau gauge as in the continuum .",
    "indeed , there exists a bounded region @xmath69 , defined by the positivity requirement for the lattice faddeev - popov operator , which satisfies bounds analogous to the ones derived for the continuum model .",
    "considering then a restriction of the functional integration to the region @xmath69 , zwanziger was able to obtain predictions for the lattice gluon propagator consistent with the continuum ones given in ( [ eq : prop ] ) and ( [ eq : propspace ] ) .",
    "at this point it is natural to try and test numerically predictions like ( [ eq : prop ] ) and ( [ eq : propspace ] ) .",
    "numerical studies have been performed in the past years for the zero spatial momentum fourier transform of ( [ eq : prolat ] ) , namely @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "these studies reported evidence of an effective gluon mass that increases with the time separation for short time intervals .",
    "this feature , which would be unacceptable for the propagator of a real physical particle since it violates the kllen - lehmann representation , is in qualitative agreement with the continuum prediction ( [ eq : propspace ] ) and may be in principle acceptable for a confined particle @xcite .",
    "another lattice approach to the gluon mass was given in @xcite .",
    "our work aims to test at a more quantitative level continuum predictions and to extend the above results through the study of the gluon propagator at nonzero momenta .",
    "we study pure glue qcd on @xmath71 and @xmath72 lattices at @xmath2 , on a @xmath73 lattice at @xmath1 and on a @xmath74 lattice at @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth remarking that , unlike simulations involving quenched quark propagators , evaluations of purely gluonic correlation functions can take full advantage of the translational symmetry of the theory in order to improve statistics . on the other hand , such quantities turn out to be very sensitive to the numerical accuracy of gauge fixing . empirically , at @xmath2 and @xmath1 we find that when the minimization of @xmath65 $ ] has reached an accuracy such that in @xmath75 iterations @xmath65 $ ] changes less than @xmath76 , then the signal for the propagators is sufficiently stable against additional gauge fixing . in other words , the variation in each data point for the propagator arising from additional gauge fixing is typically much smaller than the final error bar associated to the data point . on the contrary , we will see that at @xmath10 our stability requirement for @xmath65 $ ] does not suffice to guarantee a completely stable propagator .",
    "even at @xmath2 and @xmath1 , though , when our empirical criterion gets satisfied the system has not yet reached complete equilibrium , in spite of the fact that such an accuracy is roughly one order of magnitude better than the typical one adopted in simulations of hadron phenomenology .",
    "this can be seen by performing the following test @xcite : in the landau gauge @xmath77 it follows from the periodic boundary conditions that @xmath78 should not depend on @xmath79 . in lattice language",
    ", this means that once the landau gauge has been numerically implemented in a configuration , then the sum over the sites in a fixed timeslice of the time component of the gauge field should be the same on each timeslice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] we plot one of the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath80 as a function of @xmath81 for one of our gauge - fixed configurations on the @xmath71 lattice at @xmath2 .",
    "this test shows that even when the accuracy of our numerical gauge fixing is sufficient for the gluon propagator , there are other quantities for which the gauge fixing need not be adequate . as a consequence",
    ", it would be dangerous in a calculation to rely on some standard _ a priori _ criterion when estimating the required precision for the gauge fixing , since such precision strongly depends on the specific observable under consideration .",
    "we remark that the gauge - fixing test provided by @xmath80 is in fact more stringent than the one used in @xcite .      here",
    "we give results for a set of 25 configurations of size @xmath71 at @xmath2 , a set of 8 configurations of size @xmath72 at @xmath82 , and finally a set of 20 configurations of size @xmath73 at @xmath1 .    as a first step we have evaluated @xmath83 ; our results confirm that this propagator exhibits a massive decay in time , with an effective mass @xmath84 that increases with @xmath79 for short times . in fig .",
    "[ fig : effmass ] we plot @xmath85 versus @xmath79 with jackknife errors @xcite on the @xmath71 lattice . assuming the value of the inverse lattice spacing @xmath86 gev at @xmath2 @xcite , the effective gluon mass @xmath87 ranges approximately between 220 and 870 mev .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for the @xmath72 lattice , with the effective mass ranging between 240 and 1200 mev .    at this point",
    "we have attempted to fit @xmath88 to the continuum form ( [ eq : propspace ] ) and to the form commonly referred to as particle @xmath8 ghost , that is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is constrained to be negative .",
    "as is well known , the data points obtained from a monte carlo simulation are in general statistically correlated ; in the present case , the correlated data are the values of the propagator @xmath91 at different timeslices . for this reason , one should perform @xmath92 fits by using the definition of @xmath92 which involves the full covariance matrix @xcite .    by inspection of the covariance matrix for @xmath91",
    ", it turns out that the off - diagonal matrix elements are typically of the same size as the diagonal ones , which means that our data points are highly correlated in @xmath79 .",
    "consequently , @xmath92 fits are not well controlled because the covariance matrix is nearly singular .",
    "much higher statistics would be required to get well - behaved fits .    as it is not possible in this case to make fits using the full covariance matrix , we are forced to use the naive definition of @xmath93 , where the data points are simply weighted by their standard error bar .",
    "of course , in such an approach @xmath92 has no simple relation to `` goodness of fit . ''    in this approximation , it turns out that gribov s formula provides , for small @xmath79 , a good fit to @xmath91 , better than the one obtained from the particle @xmath8 ghost expression .",
    "in fact , although @xmath9 is not a reliable indicator of the goodness of a fit when the covariance matrix is not taken into account , nonetheless the relative @xmath9 of two fits provides some indication of which fit is better . on the @xmath71 lattice at @xmath2 , the lowest value for @xmath9 obtained from a fit to gribov s formula",
    "is @xmath94 , while from the 4-parameter fit to particle @xmath8 ghost one gets @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , the latter kind of fit is much less stable against varying the initial guess for the fit parameters , i.e. many local minima for @xmath92 can be found . using @xmath86 gev",
    ", we obtain for the @xmath5 parameter in ( [ eq : propspace ] ) @xmath96 mev , @xmath94 , where the error on @xmath5 is a jackknife one . of course one does not get good agreement by using a conventional 4-parameter double exponential form , that is if one constrains @xmath90 in ( [ eq : ghost ] ) to take positive values",
    "indeed , in this case the effective mass would always decrease with @xmath79 , in contrast to what is observed .",
    "the statistical difficulties mentioned above forbid a complete analysis of @xmath91 ; in particular , we can not effectively study the large-@xmath79 region , where according to ( [ eq : propspace ] ) the propagator may become negative and then oscillate .",
    "our analysis of the momentum space propagator @xmath97 does not have the same statistical difficulties as in the case of @xmath98 .",
    "this quantity is obtained by performing explicitly the lattice fourier transform of the propagator ( [ eq : prolat ] ) .",
    "in fact , the covariance matrix associated with @xmath3 turns out to be much more ",
    "diagonal \" than the one for @xmath98 ; in other words , the data points are much less correlated in momentum space than they are in @xmath79 .",
    "we find that @xmath3 is very well determined in a significant interval of physical momenta , ranging from the lattice infrared cutoff in the time direction @xmath99   ( @xmath100 at @xmath2 ) up to @xmath101 gev , which is in fact roughly the value of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath102 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3_4 ] ) . as a consequence",
    "we have been able to obtain good fits to @xmath3 taking into account correlations .",
    "[ fig:3_4 ] also shows that the data points from the two lattices at @xmath2 are in good agreement over most of the momentum range .    at this point",

    "the fits are performed including in @xmath93 the covariance matrix .",
    "consider first the @xmath71 lattice : it turns out that for momenta up to @xmath104 gev formula ( [ eq : prop ] ) fits the data well ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5_7 ] ) .",
    "indeed , for such a fit we obtain @xmath105 and @xmath106 mev , assuming @xmath86 gev .",
    "the error is given in terms of the parameter covariance matrix @xcite , and we are not including the uncertainty in the value of @xmath102 .",
    "we compare this result to the best fit that one can obtain from the standard massive propagator , for which we obtain @xmath107 .    on the other hand , in the range of momenta @xmath108 gev the formula ( [ eq : prop ] ) and the massive propagator expression fit the data very poorly , resulting in @xmath109 .",
    "a good fit in this range is obtained by assuming an inverse power law behavior @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pow_uv_1 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "the fact that ( [ eq : prop ] ) does not fit the high momentum region well presumably explains the discrepancy between the value of @xmath5 obtained from @xmath3 at low momenta and that obtained from @xmath113 , which depends on the complete range of momenta .",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar on the @xmath72 lattice .",
    "however , presumably due to the lower statistics , there is clear dispersion in the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3_4 ] ) , which means that no fit will be particularly good .",
    "in fact , up to 1 gev the best fit is given by ( [ eq : prop ] ) ( see fig .  [ fig:5_7 ] ) , and we obtain @xmath114 mev , @xmath115 .",
    "between 1 and 2 gev we are unable to perform fits with the covariance matrix , due to the poor statistics . without the covariance matrix , an inverse power law with @xmath116",
    "again reproduces the data well ( see fig .  [",

    "summarizing , the data for @xmath3 at @xmath82 on the @xmath71 lattice up to momenta of order 1 gev prefer somewhat formula ( [ eq : prop ] ) , which describes the mass generation @xmath117 gribov , over a standard massive propagator . in the momentum range 1 - 2 gev",
    "the propagator is best reproduced by the inverse power law behavior @xmath118 , where @xmath7 could be interpreted as the anomalous dimension of @xmath3 . indeed , our results in such a region could also be sensitive to the lattice ultraviolet cutoff @xmath102 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1 results ( described below ) agree with those at @xmath2 gives some indication that such cutoff effects are not overwhelmingly large .",
    "an additional test for lattice artifacts is described at the end of the next section .    on the other hand",
    ", the results from the @xmath72 lattice , due to the poor statistics , do not provide by themselves a strong confirmation for the above picture .",
    "still , in the low momentum region the gribov fit works better than a standard massive one and gives a value for @xmath5 which is consistent with the one from the @xmath71 lattice , but we get a high value for @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , in the higher momentum region we are unable to use the covariance matrix .",
    "we consider now a set of 20 configurations on a @xmath73 lattice at @xmath1 .",
    "starting again from the evaluation of @xmath119 , we give in fig .",
    "[ fig:2effmass ] the effective gluon mass with jackknife errors .",

    "it turns out that we have the same statistics problem as at @xmath2 : the data for @xmath119 are highly correlated in @xmath79 , so that it is impractical to make fits using the full covariance matrix .",
    "next we consider the propagator @xmath121 in momentum space .",
    "we again find that correlations between different values of @xmath27 are much smaller than the correlations in @xmath79 , so that the covariance matrix is now well behaved .",
    "the best fit to @xmath3 is obtained from the inverse power law @xmath110 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bello ] ) .",
    "we assume @xmath120 gev @xcite and get @xmath122 , @xmath123 .    given the momentum range of such a fit , which starts around 1 gev and goes up to momenta of the order @xmath124 , such a result is quite consistent with the behavior observed at @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the value for @xmath7 agrees with the one obtained on the @xmath71 lattice .",
    "both at @xmath2 and @xmath1 we have also attempted 4-parameter fits , in terms of the particle @xmath8 ghost form @xmath125 , with @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "here we give results for a set of 16 configurations on a @xmath74 lattice at @xmath10 . after implementing our standard level of gauge fixing , we find that the data for @xmath129 are , as usual , not suitable for @xmath92 fits with the full covariance matrix .",
    "when fit without the covariance matrix , the data seem to be best reproduced by a simple decreasing exponential , unlike what happened on the other data sets at weaker couplings .",
    "correspondingly , there is no clear evidence for an increase of the effective gluon mass @xmath85 on a significant time interval ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : effmass57 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the results for @xmath3 on this lattice differ from what we observed at weaker couplings . assuming @xmath130 gev , our data for @xmath3 cover a momentum range up to roughly 1 gev .",
    "the best fit to such data ( including the full covariance matrix ) is provided by a free massive boson propagator @xmath131 .",
    "we obtain @xmath132 mev , with @xmath133 .    since from the above analysis",
    "the results at @xmath10 seem to differ significantly from those at @xmath2 and @xmath1 , we have investigated the effect of improving the accuracy of the gauge fixing .",
    "after 300 additional sweeps on each configuration , we repeat our measurements .    for @xmath129",
    "it turns out that while the central values of the individual data points do change significantly , the pattern of the effective mass @xmath85 is basically the same .",
    "not surprisingly , the best fit is still provided by a simple exponential , with a value for the mass parameter which is close to the one obtained before the additional sweeps ; in other words , to a first approximation the effect of additional gauge fixing has been a rescaling of the data points .",
    "as far as @xmath3 is concerned , the individual data points are not much affected by the additional gauge fixing .",

    "summarizing , we find that the qualitative behavior of the data is not changed by the additional gauge fixing , maintaining the discrepancy with the other lattices . however , since the value of @xmath136 in the fit for @xmath3 has increased as well as some individual error bars for the data points , the additional gauge fixing seems to have increased the  noise \" in the evaluation of @xmath3 .",
    "this may be related to the existence of gribov copies in our gauge @xcite .    to go back to the main issue , which is the discrepancy between @xmath3 at @xmath10 and at weaker couplings , our present data give some indication that such a discrepancy may be due to a lack of scaling at @xmath10 . to illustrate this point we have plotted for each data set the quantity @xmath137 .",
    "such a quantity should not depend on @xmath23 , as long as one is in the scaling region . on the other hand ,",
    "when comparing @xmath138 at different @xmath23 one has an uncertainty related to the determination of the horizontal scale , i.e. the scale of physical momenta , depending on the values of @xmath102 . with this",

    "this may account for the observed discrepancies , although further analysis and better statistics are needed to clarify this issue .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have checked the stability of our fits for @xmath3 versus the use of continuum and lattice formulas .",

    "the results at @xmath1 are consistent , but only the high momentum region is accessible because of the small physical size of the lattice .",
    "thus the behavior of the propagator for the above values of @xmath23 could be summarized by the determination of a mass scale @xmath5 and an anomalous dimension @xmath7 . in spite of the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath102 , our numerical values for @xmath7 are consistent between @xmath2 and @xmath1 lattices , when assuming @xmath86 gev at @xmath2 and @xmath120 gev at @xmath1 . for @xmath5 ,",
