    "among the x - ray brightest active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the local universe due to its 210 kev luminosity largely exceeding 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath7 , mr  2251@xmath0178 ( @xmath10 ; canizares , mcclintock & ricker 1978 ) is a spectacular object in every respect .",
    "it was the first quasar to be detected and identified through x - ray observations ( cooke et al .",
    "1978 ; ricker et al .",
    "1978 ) , as well as the first one where the presence was established of _ warm _ absorption by photoionized gas , variable in both ionization state and possibly column density over timescales of less than one year ( halpern 1984 ) .",
    "the source was later found to experience appreciable changes in the x - ray flux over periods of @xmath11 days ( pan , stewart & pounds 1990 ) , with a tight correlation between the ionization parameter of the absorbing gas , where @xmath12 is the electron density of the gas and @xmath13 is its distance from an ionizing source with 11000 ry luminosity @xmath14 ( tarter , tucker & salpeter 1969 ) . ] and the continuum luminosity ( mineo & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "narrow absorption lines with a systematic blueshift of @xmath15 km s@xmath7 have been detected in the ultraviolet ( uv ) due to ly@xmath16 , n  v and c  iv ( monier et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , the c  iv doublet apparently vanished in less than four years ( ganguly , charlton & eracleous 2001 ) , implying that the uv absorber is truly local to the agn , and that it is possibly one and the same with the soft x - ray warm absorber .",
    "much deeper insights came with the advent of high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "early _ xmm  newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) observations hinted at a multiphase configuration for the warm absorber , likely consisting of two or three distinct components ( kaspi et al .",
    "2004 ) , while the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) spectrum revealed a highly ionized absorption feature in the iron k band , interpreted as the fe  xxvi ly@xmath16 line at the sizable outflow velocity of @xmath17 ( gibson et al .",
    "the corresponding mass - loss rate was calculated to be at least an order of magnitude larger than the accretion rate , unless the covering fraction of the outflow is very small .",
    "the environment of mr  2251@xmath0178 is likewise exceptional .",
    "the quasar lies in the outskirts of a loose , irregular cluster with several tens of galaxies ( phillips 1980 ) , and is surrounded by a huge emission - line nebula detected in h@xmath16 and [ o  iii ] at optical wavelengths out to a distance of @xmath18 kpc from the central source ( bergeron et al .",
    "1983 ; shopbell , veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1999 ) .",
    "the knotty and filamentary appearance of this gaseous envelope is more typical of powerful radio galaxies , yet mr  2251@xmath0178 only shows weak radio emission , whose elongated morphology resembles a double - lobed jet - like structure ( macchetto et al .",
    "1990 ) . a similar spatial extent and orientation marks the ionization cones recently found through deep [ o  iii]@xmath195007/h@xmath20 and [ n  ii]@xmath196583/h@xmath16 flux ratio maps ( kreimeyer & veilleux 2013 ) .",
    "overall , the quasar radiation field can easily account for the ionization state of the nebula , which is arguably the most extended around a radio - quiet source . its origin ,",
    "however , is still unclear .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission along some directions was preliminary reported by gibson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on the smoothed hetg zeroth - order image taken in 2002 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not safely corroborate these findings through the much deeper 2011 hetg data set , since the artificial broadening of the instrumental point spread function due to photon pile - up overrides any faint contribution from the halo . per cent with respect to 2002 .",
    "while the effects of pile - up on the point spread function can be qualitatively simulated , they prevent any accurate image reconstruction . ]",
    "due to its key role as the underlying source of ionizing photons for the ambient gas , from nuclear to intergalactic scales , a proper knowledge of the shape and behaviour of the intrinsic x - ray continuum is highly desirable , yet most of the effort in the wealth of x - ray analyses performed so far has concentrated on improving the characterization of the multi - component warm absorber . incidentally",
    ", all the x - ray spectral studies actually agree with describing the absorbed continuum by means of a power law of photon index @xmath21 , with a high - energy exponential cutoff at @xmath18 kev ( orr et al .",
    "2001 ) and a soft excess below @xmath22 kev ( kaspi et al .",
    "2004 ) . in a recent paper , we have taken advantage of coordinated @xmath23 ks long _ chandra _ hetg and _ xmm  newton _ rgs observations to bring our grasp on the properties of the intervening ionized gas to unprecedented detail and energy resolution ( reeves et al . 2013 ; hereafter r13 ) .",
    "both campaigns were conducted as large programs in late 2011 , with just a few weeks of separation from one another , and yielded intriguing information on the illuminating continuum itself , which below 2 kev is required to be much steeper ( @xmath24 ) than typically estimated at hard x - rays . indeed , the analysis of the _ suzaku _ spectrum carried out by gofford et al . ( 2011 ) had already suggested that the broadband x - ray emission of mr  2251@xmath0178 can be reproduced equally well through a softer power law with @xmath25 , provided that an additional cold - gas column of @xmath26 @xmath3 covering a moderate fraction of the source is introduced .    in the wake of these indications , here we present a thorough investigation of the 0.310 kev epic / pn spectrum obtained in the 2011 _ xmm  newton _ observation , with the aim of understanding the nature of the primary photoionizing continuum and unveiling the high - energy physical processes at work in the very central regions of this powerful quasar .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we provide the basic details about the _ xmm  newton _ large observing program on mr  2251@xmath0178 , and describe the principal steps of our data reduction .",
    "section  3 is dedicated to the spectral analysis , whose results and main implications are discussed in section  4 .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section  5 . throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed @xmath27  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in agreement with the latest values of the concordance cosmological parameters ( hinshaw et al .",
    "the long - look _ xmm  newton _ monitoring of mr  2251@xmath0178 was performed in separate exposures over three consecutive satellite orbits , starting on 2011 november 11 , 13 , and 15 , respectively ( obsids 0670120201301401 ; pi : j.  reeves ) .",
    "the corresponding data files were processed with the science analysis system ( sas ) v12.0 , and were inspected with the standard software packages . as the source is quite bright",
    ", all the epic cameras were operated in small window mode , in order to avoid the distortion effects of photon pile - up by virtue of the reduced frame time . according to the 1012 kev light curves , no strong",
    "background flaring occurred during any of the observations ; only a modest rise is seen at both the start and the end of the first and the third ones .",
    "these periods of weak background activity were rejected adopting a threshold of 0.5 counts s@xmath7 for the pn , and of 0.35 counts s@xmath7 for the two mos detectors . however , due to an average 0.310 kev count rate of @xmath30 s@xmath7 over a 25@xmath31 extraction region , the mos spectra turned out to be still moderately piled - up , and have not been used in this work .",
    "the epic / pn spectra of the source were extracted from a circular region with radius of 36@xmath31 centred on the target , while the background was evaluated on two identical areas of smaller size ( 31@xmath31 ) at @xmath325 of distance .",
    "the same extraction regions were used for all the data sets , in view of their possible merging in the absence of any significant spectral variability during the span of the entire campaign . indeed , fig .",

    ", there is no evidence of conspicuous changes in the spectral shape .",
    "this was also confirmed by the comparison of the three x - ray spectra averaged over the separate observations , which were therefore combined into a single one . given the lower pn live time in small window mode ( 71 per cent ) , the total effective exposure is @xmath33 ks .",
    "individual redistribution matrices and ancillary response files at the source position were created through the sas tasks ` rmfgen ` and ` arfgen ` , and were subsequently merged as well .",
    "the x - ray data were grouped to a minimum of 200 counts per energy channel , and the spectral analysis was performed using the xspec v12.8 fitting package .",
    "all the uncertainties are quoted at the 90 per cent confidence level ( @xmath34 ) for the single parameter of interest , while line energies are given in the rest frame , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we have also taken into account the target photometry in the six wide - band filters of the optical monitor ( om ) , whose data were reprocessed with the ` omichain ` pipeline .",
    "only the small high - resolution window at the centre of the field of view has been considered .",
    "count rates were averaged over the different exposures , with a 10 per cent uncertainty added in quadrature owing to possible systematics in the fluxes of the standard stars .",
    "an absorption correction was also applied , based on the foreground dust reddening maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) and the extinction law of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) . with @xmath35 , averaged within a 5@xmath36 radius from mr  2251@xmath0178 , and @xmath37 as per the standard value for the diffuse interstellar medium , we obtain @xmath38 mag , which leads to a flux correction ranging from @xmath39 ( v band ) to 1.42 ( uvw2 band ) .",

    "limited to the x - ray domain , there are still many questions regarding mr  2251@xmath0178 . while further progress on the side of the warm absorber above 2 kev will perhaps be feasible only with the new technology of x - ray micro - calorimeters onboard the future _ astro  h _ mission , at present the most critical point involves the origin and intrinsic properties of the continuum .",
    "the photon index observed in this source is unusually hard compared to the average value of @xmath40 generally found among radio - quiet quasars in the same x - ray luminosity range ( e.g. piconcelli et al . 2005 ; scott et al . 2011 ) . yet",
    "the intensity of the warm absorption lines entails a much softer radiation field below 2 kev ( @xmath41 ; r13 ) , denoting either an intrinsically steep continuum ( which could be missed if some fraction of it were intercepted by cold gas layers still left unmodelled ) or an inherent soft excess ( e.g. done et al .",
    "2012 ) . after a brief overview of the main results from our recent high - resolution analysis , in this section we explore in depth the partial covering conjecture and other possible interpretations for the broadband x - ray emission of mr  2251@xmath0178 .      as discussed in detail in r13 , both",
    "the _ xmm  newton _ rgs and the almost coeval _ chandra _ hetg spectra reveal the presence of multiple , partially ionized gas components along the line of sight to the primary x - ray source in mr  2251@xmath0178 .",
    "after a preliminary gaussian fit of the individual lines for parameterization and identification purposes , the absorption spectra were modelled by means of self - consistent photoionization grids generated through the xstar code v2.2 ( e.g. kallman & bautista 2001 ) , and implemented within xspec as multiplicative tables .",
    "three fully - covering warm absorption components were required in order to account for the wealth of atomic transitions and the wide ionization state of the gas .",
    "the generic spectral grid was computed assuming a power - law x - ray continuum with @xmath42 .",
    "the turbulence velocity was set to @xmath43 km s@xmath7 , based on the narrow profile of most lines ; larger values result in substantially worse fits .",
    "the electron density , instead , is not a highly sensitive parameter .",
    "the corresponding tables provide a good fit to the mid- to high - ionization lines , due to fe l - shell ions as well as he- and h - like species of lighter elements like c , n , o , ne , mg and si . a separate grid , finely tuned over a limited region of the parameter space and involving a steeper illuminating continuum ( @xmath44 ) , was introduced to better match the intensity of the low - ionization inner - shell lines , including the fe m - shell unresolved transition array ( uta ; e.g. behar , sako & kahn 2001 ) .",
    "interestingly , this component seems to respond to long - term flux changes , thus being in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "the kinematics and variability properties indicate that warm absorption likely occurs beyond the pc scale , i.e. within the inner narrow line region .",

    "specifically , the extrapolation of the intrinsic continuum with @xmath55 in _ pcovpow _ falls short across @xmath56 kev , where the curvature simulates a sort of broad , residual hump that remains unfitted .",
    "the original goodness is preserved in _ discref _ through a standard rollover at @xmath57 kev , yet the most effective model is confirmed to be _ pcovdbb _ ( @xmath58 ) , with @xmath59 kev and @xmath60 kev ( table  [ t7 ] ) . also the cross normalization factor @xmath61 between the epic / pn and bat spectra is a valuable diagnostic . in the pure partial covering scenario we get",
    "@xmath62 , meaning that during the _ xmm  newton _ observation the source has to be moderately underluminous with respect to its average state .",
    "in other words , the hard x - rays are somewhat underpredicted .",
    "the contrary occurs with disc reflection , for which @xmath63 , while in the composite _ pcovdbb _ case the match is virtually optimal , with @xmath64 .",
    "such incongruences are potentially revealing , and are inherent to the models themselves .",
    "in fact , while any absorption effect rapidly decreases with energy , the reflection contribution grows , and the presence of a strong reflection component on top of a flatter @xmath65 keeps the flux level above 10 kev significantly higher .",
    "the implications will be further discussed in the next section .",
    "switching to the low energy side , it is worth considering the source flux in the six _ xmm  newton_/om filters .",
    "it is quite striking that the extrapolation of the _ swift_/bat spectral shape generally overlaps with the optical points , with a slope just slightly steeper than @xmath66 .",
    "the variability of mr  2251@xmath0178 in the optical and x - ray bands is known to be very well correlated , with a mutual delay consistent with zero and anyway not larger than four days ( arvalo et al . 2008 ) , i.e. less than the span of this long - look observation .",
    "however , it is unlikely for a single continuum component to extend across nearly five decades in energy , with just the partial covering absorption effects producing an apparent broad trough at @xmath2210 kev . like the high - energy cutoff in the primary x - ray power law",
    "can be naturally related to the temperature of the relativistic electrons in the corona , a similar drop in response to the temperature of the seed photons from the disc must stand somewhere in the uv . with the central black hole accreting at a @xmath670.5 fraction of the eddington rate , the inner disc temperature in mr  2251@xmath0178 is predicted to lie in the range from @xmath11 to 50 ev , irrespective of the exact spin ( e.g. peterson 1997 ) .",
    "no substantial power - law contribution should then leak down to the om bands . in any case , the optical and x - ray sources are tightly connected , and the former can be almost certainly identified with the accretion disc .",
    "the only model that intrinsically includes the disc thermal emission is _",
    "optxagn_. neglecting the extremely poor fit statistics at 0.310 kev and any discrepancy with the bat spectrum , once informed with the results of _ pcovdbb _ on e.g. @xmath68 and @xmath69 , _ optxagn _ yields a very smooth connection to the om fluxes , with all the six points falling within 30 per cent of the extrapolation from the x - ray band for a range of sensible values of both the eddington ratio and the coronal radius .",
    "it should be noted that departures from the adopted galactic extinction law might be involved , as well as some extra reddening local to the source , possibly subject to the anomalous dust - to - gas ratios commonly found among agn ( e.g. maiolino et al . 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , the om fluxes could contain some contribution from the strong emission lines revealed by the _ hst _",
    "uv spectrum ( monier et al . 2001 ) , in particular mg  ii in uvw1 and c  iii ] in uvw2 .",
    "none the less , the observed correspondence suggests that the basic geometrical and physical assumptions underlying the ` optxagnf ` comptonization picture ( done et al . 2012 ) are relevant to mr  2251@xmath0178 , at least qualitatively .",
    "the unprocessed disc component has to be included in all our other models as a separate multi - temperature blackbody .",
    "being constrained over the om range only , the peak temperature is @xmath703 ev , and the luminosity is @xmath71 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "we consider this a conservative limit for the thermal emission from the outer disc .",

    "2011 for a thorough discussion on the visualization of _ true _ x - ray spectra ) .",
    "the red solid curve traces the best - fitting extended _ pcovdbb _ model , which includes a second , low - temperature disc component and a high - energy cutoff .",

    "the 2011 _ xmm  newton _ observation supplied the highest - quality x - ray spectrum of mr  2251@xmath0178 to date , with over 5 million net counts over the 0.310 kev band .",
    "this notwithstanding , based on the epic / pn analysis alone the origin of the intrinsic x - ray continuum would remain somewhat unclear , as partial covering absorption , ionized reflection , and comptonized disc emission models can not be statistically discriminated at ccd resolution . the availability of exquisite high - resolution data offers a straightforward way to test the soundness of the different fits , in which the column densities and ionization parameters of the warm absorption components have been allowed to vary with respect to the reference values of table  [ t1 ] . indeed ,",
    "while various warm absorber configurations are still acceptable for the 0.310 kev continuum shape , it is evident from fig .",
    "[ nx ] that in some cases the combined shifts in both @xmath50 and @xmath51 lead to a complete displacement of a given component within the parameter space . to a lesser extent , this is also true for the finest grid , which is the best - constrained in the broadband analysis due to its low ionization ( e.g. table  [ t3 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 has been used as a gauge of how much the warm absorption properties are distorted to minimize the fit statistics of each model .",
    "the deviations are largest in reflection - based models , which show strong residuals ( mainly corresponding to the o  vii emission line ) when superimposed on the rgs spectra .",
    "not surprisingly , _ pcovpow _ is instead nearly consistent with r13 , where an equivalent partially covered continuum was adopted .",
    "yet , the closest agreement is delivered by _ pcovdbb _",
    ", with @xmath76 ( table  [ t6 ] ) . indeed , in trying to fit the epic / pn and rgs spectra simultaneously ,",
    "_ pcovpow _ and _ pcovdbb _ turn out to be equally effective .    as already mentioned , another useful diagnostic is the scale factor between the epic / pn and bat spectra , especially because of the opposite trend entailed by the _",
    "pcovpow _ and _ discref _ models . for ease of comparison ,",
    "we have collected the about 40 measurements of the 210 kev flux obtained by ten x - ray observatories over more than three decades . the lowest and highest states correspond to the 1989 _ ginga _ observation ( mineo & stewart 1993 ) and to the first 1993 _ asca _ snapshot ( kaspi et al .",
    "2004 ) , respectively at @xmath77 and @xmath78 erg s@xmath7 @xmath3 .",
    "the mean / median intensity is @xmath79@xmath80 erg s@xmath7 @xmath3 , suggesting that the 2011 _ xmm  newton _ campaign caught the source in a relatively bright phase , arguably @xmath8130 per cent above the average .",
    "qualitatively , this would disfavour the pure partial covering picture , but it is not yet a conclusive hint in any direction for several reasons .",
    "the magnitude of the cross normalization actually casts serious doubts also on _ discref _ , whose application to the 2009 _ suzaku _ data set confirms that the sizable offset between the 0.610 and 1550 kev spectra is not related to different flux states .",
    "the small value of @xmath82 and the cutoff at @xmath57 kev would then compensate for the obvious absence of a prominent compton hump , which is perhaps related also to the clear pattern in the fit residuals starting above 9 kev ( fig .",
    "[ dm ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , cold absorption effects can easily halve the 210 kev emission , artificially expanding the scope of the intrinsic x - ray variability;4 months to obtain similar error bars on each point , the 70-month _ swift_/bat light curve shows peak - to - peak variations by a factor of @xmath83 . ] the source might simply look fainter because it is more obscured . in this view , even a cross normalization slightly larger than one could be broadly consistent with the observational history of mr  2251@xmath0178 , also given that @xmath61 strongly depends on the actual photon index .",
    "moreover , in the regular monitoring by _ rxte _ discussed in arevalo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , consisting of over 200 snapshots in 2.5 years with 1 ks exposure each , the inferred 210 kev flux covers the @xmath84@xmath85 erg s@xmath7 @xmath3 range . disregarding any possible systematics in the latter estimates , their average value of @xmath86 erg s@xmath7 @xmath3 is about 20 per cent larger than the flux recorded in the _ xmm  newton _ observation , in agreement with the extrapolation to the _ swift_/bat spectrum of _ pcovpow _ , which anyway returns a very poor fit around 50 kev . as a consequence , the composite model _",
    "pcovdbb _ is definitely preferred .",
    "an accurate , simultaneous broadband analysis , which has now become feasible at @xmath8780 kev thanks to _ nustar _ ( harrison et al .",
    "2013 ) , is clearly needed to shed new light on the nature of the high - energy emission of mr  2251@xmath0178 , although the soft x - rays can not be neglected to properly constrain the warm absorber and the putative soft excess .",
    "the global curvature is undoubtedly the most puzzling feature of the broadband x - ray continuum in this source , with its strikingly different slopes below and above 10 kev .",
    "a similar behaviour has been observed in a completely different object , the dwarf seyfert galaxy ngc 4395 , known to host the least massive black hole among agn ( @xmath88 ; peterson et al .",
    "its 210 kev spectral shape is extraordinarily flat , characterized by a photon index that can be as low as @xmath89 ( moran et al . 2005 ) , yet turning into the typical @xmath66 of unobscured agn at higher energies .",
    "ngc 4395 actually undergoes dramatic spectral variability over timescales of a few ks , which can be ascribed to a complex system of cold absorbers with column densities of @xmath9010@xmath91 @xmath3 , crossing the line of sight to the primary source ( nardini & risaliti 2011 ) .",
    "it is then possible that in mr  2251@xmath0178 the observed 210 kev continuum is misleading , not being representative of the intrinsic emission without a correct modelling of the absorption effects .",
    "indeed , such a hard slope poses an issue with the depth of the inner - shell lines in the low - ionization warm absorber , which call for a soft @xmath92 illumination .",
    "overall , the grating analysis suggests a break in the input photoionizing spectrum , with a sort of intrinsic soft excess converting into a much flatter power law than typically found in radio - quiet quasars .    following r13 , who suggest an association with the same blr clouds responsible for the soft x - ray emission lines , we assume that the partial - covering gas is more internal than the pc - scale warm absorber , and approximate the radiation impinging on the latter as a broken power law in order to assess its crude outline . within _ pcovpow _ , the soft photon index is bound to the @xmath55 of the unabsorbed continuum , which is possibly not steep enough to comply with the prescriptions from the warm absorption lines .",
    "the extra blackbody - like component included in the _ pcovdbb _ model results in a broadly acceptable effective slope of @xmath93 below the break energy of @xmath94 kev .",
    "the implied temperature of @xmath95 kev is at least three times larger than that expected in mr  2251@xmath0178 for a standard thin accretion disc , but it is commensurate with the typical values recorded for the soft x - ray excess in agn ( e.g. jin et al . 2012 ) , whose origin is still essentially unknown . despite these uncertainties , the combination of cold absorption in the form of partial covering and some kind of compton reprocessing stands as the most convincing interpretation on the whole , also conceding that the comptonization conjecture lends weight to the tight connection between the accretion disc and the x - ray corona ( arevalo et al . 2008 ) .",
    "given that the x - ray source in agn is presumed to be extremely compact ( a few tens of gravitational radii at most ) , partial covering can be only envisaged in a dynamical context ; in other words , it has to occur at blr scales .",
    "it is easy to show , in fact , that if no changes in the covering factor are perceived over several years the putative absorber must be located at least a few pc away from the emitting region , and be much larger of it . under these circumstances ,",
    "any partial covering configuration is highly unlikely . concerning mr  2251@xmath0178",
    ", the lack of any appreciable changes other than the slow decline in the overall flux intensity during the _ xmm  newton _ long look is not particularly worrying given the large mass of the central black hole .",
    "the relevant timescale to the variations of the intrinsic x - ray emission , for instance , is the light - crossing time , which is @xmath96 ks assuming that the source is spherical and has a diameter of @xmath97 ( compare with fig .",
    "[ lc ] ) . on the other hand , within an eclipsing cloud scenario ( e.g. ngc  1365 ; risaliti et al .",
    "2007 ) , the occultation time by a single gaseous clump with identical size and shape to the x - ray source in keplerian motion at a distance of @xmath98 would be nearly 2 weeks , against the 5.5 days of elapsed time in present observation . by using the recent @xmath99@xmath100(5100 ) relationship from bentz et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and the average 5100  luminosity from lira et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we indeed obtain a blr radius of about 75 light days , i.e. @xmath101 .",
    "notably , as also reported in r13 , there are hints of some change in the covering fractions between the _ xmm  newton _ and _ chandra _ campaigns , separated by just a few weeks .",
    "the partial covering interpretation for the x - ray spectra of agn thus relies on the identification of rapid spectral variability .",
    "keeping in mind the expanded timescale , the long look of mr  2251@xmath0178 is equivalent to the shorter snapshots of ngc 4395 , which sampled a single state of the source . in this framework",
    ", we can draw similar speculations on the structure of the cold x - ray absorber , holding for both _",
    "pcovpow _ and _ pcovdbb_. two distinct components emerge from the pure partial covering fit . in a stratified circumnuclear medium ,",
    "the possibility that two _ clouds _ belonging to detached layers simultaneously cover different sectors of the x - ray source is rather contrived . in principle , the disparity of about one order of magnitude between the column densities involved would allow for projection effects , with the two components partially on top of each other",
    ". the assessed covering fraction @xmath102 would be simply a lower limit to the effective one . yet",
    "the fact that both @xmath103 and @xmath104 are very well constrained , and in particular that the uncertainty on @xmath104 is only @xmath105 ( at the 90 per cent confidence level ) , seems to rule out this solution . on the contrary",
    ", a single absorber can meet the fit conditions if bearing sharp density gradients and/or irregular geometry .",
    "indeed , it has been recently suggested that the eclipsing blr clouds might actually have a comet - like structure , with a dense head and a tenuous tail ( maiolino et al . 2010 ; risaliti et al . 2011 ) .",
    "such blobs could have a lifetime of several months at most , implying that this blr component must be continuously replenished .",
    "it is therefore a matter of duty cycle and likelihood for a gas clump to pass in front of the x - ray source .",
    "the transit of a single cloud , further supported by the robustness of the _ pcovdbb _ picture , is ultimately the most reliable scenario in this sense .",
    "limited to the column density changes of the warm absorber , the presence of material moving in and out the line of sight had already been invoked ( e.g. orr et al .",
    "2001 ; kaspi et al .",
    "this bulk motion might exist throughout the spatial scales .",
    "the spectral variability aspects are then crucial for any of the physical models examined here , and will be investigated in detail in a subsequent paper ( porquet et al . , in preparation ) considering all the highest - quality recent and archival observations of mr  2251@xmath0178 .",
    "summarizing , our analysis still leaves some open issues .",
    "however , irrespective of the real nature of its x - ray emission and of the amount of absorbing gas along the line of sight , mr  2251@xmath0178 is confirmed to boast one of the largest x - ray to optical luminosity ratios among radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this is clearly pointed out by its @xmath106 spectral index .. note that @xmath107 for a flat sed ( in @xmath72 ) . ] without applying any correction , the observed @xmath108 extracted from the broadband sed of fig .",
    "[ fs ] is already much lower than the mean value for x - ray selected agn , i.e. @xmath109 ( with a 1@xmath74 dispersion of 0.18 ; lusso et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the dual partial covering case",
    ", the rest - frame brightness at 2 kev has to be revised upwards by a factor of @xmath110 , delivering an even more exceptional optical to x - ray spectral index of 1.05 .",
    "this does not heavily impact the bolometric output of mr  2251@xmath0178 though , once the correlation between @xmath106 and the 210 kev to bolometric correction ( @xmath111 ) is taken into account .",
    "we obtain that @xmath11212 ( e.g. lusso et al .",
    "2010 ; marchese et al .",
    "2012 ) , for a total luminosity @xmath113 of @xmath1147@xmath11510@xmath116 erg s@xmath7 , which is @xmath11725 per cent of the source eddington luminosity and is just above the uv - based estimate ( dunn et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the light of these outstanding properties , including the possible massive disc outflow ( gibson et al . 2005 ; gofford et al .",
    "2011 ) , unveiling the x - ray emission mechanism and its coupling with the absorbing / reprocessing gas would have far - reaching implications for the quasar radiative and mechanical feedback on the surrounding environment and all the related fields .",
    "based on a recent _ xmm  newton _ long - look observation with @xmath33 ks of net exposure , we have reported on the 0.310 kev epic / pn spectral analysis of mr  2251@xmath0178 , one of the brightest radio - quiet quasars in the local universe .",
    "following a companion paper dedicated to the study of the high - resolution grating spectra and of the physical properties of the complex warm absorber , here we have focused on the nature of the intrinsic x - ray emission .",
    "the broadband x - ray continuum of mr  2251@xmath0178 is known to exhibit substantial curvature up to @xmath18 kev , where a possible cutoff is also present .",
    "together with the apparent soft excess below 0.7 kev and the warm absorption trough at @xmath222 kev , this gives rise to a peculiar steep  flat  steep spectral shape , which has been inspected within the frameworks of partial covering absorption , ionized reflection , and comptonized disc emission .    as their application turns out to be nearly statistically equivalent over the 0.310 kev band ,",
    "all these models have also been compared with the coeval om photometric data and the @xmath4150 kev _",
    "swift_/bat spectrum , averaged over 70 months . assuming no cross normalization , the entire sed shows that the optical and hard x - ray fluxes lie at almost the same level in @xmath72 units .",
    "indeed , the optical to x - ray spectral index is extremely small ( @xmath118 ) , irrespective of the exact absorption correction .",
    "the corresponding bolometric output of mr  2251@xmath0178 is estimated to be @xmath119@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 , i.e. @xmath11725 per cent of the source eddington luminosity .",
    "none of the alternative interpretations taken into account in this work are conclusive by themselves , displaying both strengths and limitations at the same time , which can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) the pure partial covering scenario reveals two distinct low - ionization components with columns of 0.6 and @xmath120 @xmath3 , eclipsing a fraction of @xmath121 and 0.49 of the x - ray source , respectively .",
    "we argue that these absorbers are located at blr scales , but are unlikely to belong to different layers .",
    "density gradients might be entailed , pointing to a single clump of gas with a dense core and a lighter halo .",
    "the intrinsic photon index @xmath55 is close to what is required by the photoionization models of the warm absorber , but still somewhat lower ; even so , excess curvature is left at hard x - rays around 50 kev .",
    "\\2 ) at epic / pn resolution , x - ray reflection provides a reasonable fit without implying any extreme gravity regime .",
    "the blurred disc component , however , is unusually cold , and @xmath56 times less ionized than its distant counterpart .",
    "this is possibly an artefact to compensate for the inadequate results with the soft x - ray emission lines ( resolved by the gratings ) , and also leads to a misrepresentation of the warm absorption properties ( for which the illumination is anyway flat ) .",
    "the degree of smoothing appears too large for the iron k band , and a clear pattern is found in the residuals above 9 kev .",
    "moreover , the bat spectrum is largely overpredicted .",
    "\\3 ) the optically - thick / thin comptonization of thermal photons from the inner disc into both the soft excess and the hard power law , with the outer regions emitting as a colour temperature corrected blackbody , is established as the most obvious connection between the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of the remarkably good extrapolation to the om data and of the ample leverage on the physical parameters , a basic self - consistent model either fails to reproduce the 0.310 kev features or invariably plummets too quickly at higher energies .",
    "any agreement is lost on the three warm absorption components .",
    "a composite model allows us to successfully overcome most of the above shortcomings .",
    "while reflection from the accretion flow and/or the ambient material might still be involved to a certain extent , in the preferred picture the hard power - law continuum ( @xmath122 ) steepens below @xmath22 kev into a soft excess with @xmath123 kev , whose origin remains unclear although it can be tentatively associated with comptonization in the disc atmosphere . a single cloud with @xmath124 @xmath3 is present along the line of sight , covering about one sixth of the x - ray source .    in conclusion",
    ", the x - ray observations of mr  2251@xmath0178 brought to light a complex and stratified environment close to the central source , which deeply transforms the shape of the intrinsic x - ray spectrum .",
    "our study suggests that only a combination of time variability analysis , simultaneous broadband coverage and high spectral resolution can help disentangling the effects of the different physical processes responsible for the observed x - ray emission of agn .",
