    "ssss were first detected in the magellanic clouds with the _ einstein _ and _ exosat _ satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "later observations with _ rosat _ verified their supersoft nature and showed that ssss do not emit significantly at energies above @xmath0kev ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "typical blackbody parameters of ssss are a temperature of @xmath1k and an effective radius of @xmath2 cm , which suggests their luminosities to be as high as @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "first thoughts about the nature of the ssss included accretion onto black holes @xcite and neutron stars accreting above the eddington rate @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed difficulties with the neutron star / black hole model , and proposed the possibility that the supersoft x - ray emission is the result of steady nuclear burning of hydrogen accreted onto the surface of a massive white dwarfs ( wds ) . at present",
    ", this scenario represents the favoured model explaining the high energy output produced by these objects .",
    "various phenomena associated with mass - accreting wds in ssss were reviewed by @xcite .",
    "ssss are understood as interacting binary systems consisting of an accreting compact object and a low - mass ( @xmath5 ) main - sequence or slightly evolved late - type star . in special cases ,",
    "the donor star can also be an m - type giant .",
    "the latter sources are often called as syxbs .",
    "they were identified by finding a red giant counterpart to the primarily detected x - ray source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , many classical symbiotic stars have also been detected as x - ray sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , as a natural consequence of their hot component properties , ( @xmath6k , @xmath7 , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "transient ssss emerge also during nova outbursts , when the radius of the expanding wd pseudophotosphere gradually shrinks , radiates at higher temperature , and thus shifts the maximum of its energy distribution from the optical to soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "determination of physical parameters of ssss has been usually based solely on analyzing the x - ray data , which , however , cover only a very small fraction of their total spectrum . as a result ,",
    "a good fit to the x - ray data was often achieved with very different sets of parameters and/or models .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained a satisfactory fit ( @xmath8 ) to the _ rosat _ data of a stable sss , smp smc 22 , with a blackbody and an atmospheric model .",
    "however , the luminosity of their blackbody fit was more than a factor of 10 higher than that given by the atmospheric model .",
    "recently , @xcite studied this object with _ xmm - newton _ , and also fitted successfully the x - ray data with both the blackbody and a nlte atmospheric model .",
    "they did not find a significant difference between luminosities from both models , but the temperature of their preferred atmospheric model was only @xmath9k , in contrast to @xmath10k of the heise et al .",
    "satisfactory fits to x - ray observations , corresponding to very wide range of possible parameters , were found by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such the ambiguity in the inferred parameters is probably caused by fitting only a very small part of the total sss spectrum .",
    "accordingly , in this paper i propose a method to determine the fundamental , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 parameters of ssss by _ multiwavelength _ modelling their global sed throughout a very large , x - ray to near - ir , spectral range ( sect .  2 ) .",
    "in sect .",
    "3 i apply the method to selected objects and introduce the results . their discussion and summary are found in sects .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "depending on the nature of a sss , there can be a certain and variable amount of the circumstellar material ( csm ) in the system , which is subject to ionization by the sss radiation .",
    "for example , during the nebular stage of nova outburst , the ejected material reprocesses a fraction of the hot wd s radiation into the nebular emission . in the case of syxbs ,",
    "the nebular component of radiation is produced also by the ionized part of the neutral wind from the cool giant .",
    "thus the nebular component has to be included in the multiwavelength modelling the sed .",
    "in addition , the cool giant in syxbs dominates the near - ir with a significant contribution to the optical . as a result ,",
    "the composite spectrum emitted by a sss , @xmath13 , can be generally expressed as a superposition of these three basic radiative components , @xmath14 @xmath15 is the flux produced by the hot _ stellar _ ( pseudo)photosphere of a sss ( i.e. its central star and/or disk ) , @xmath16 is the _ nebular _ component from the ionized csm ( i.e. that produced by thermal plasma ) and @xmath17 is the contribution from the cool giant .    to achieve the aim of this paper",
    ", it means to disentangle the observed composite spectrum into its individual components , i.e. to determine their physical parameters .",
    "however , the radiation observed at the earth have to be corrected for the attenuation by the ism and csm , placed between the source and the observer .      assuming that no emission occurs on the path from the source to the observer",
    ", we can use the simplest solution of the radiative transfer equation to correct the observed sss fluxes as @xmath18 where @xmath15 is the spectrum emitted by the sss , its angular radius @xmath19 scales it to that observed at the earth ( @xmath20 ) and the optical depth @xmath21 attenuates it along the line of sight . in the x - ray domain we consider attenuation of the light by b ",
    "f absorptions , while for wavelengths @xmath22   we consider selective extinction on dust particles as the only absorber within the interstellar matter ( ism ) . in the former case , @xmath21 is given by the absorption cross - section per atom , @xmath23 , of the element , @xmath24 , and the total number of atoms on the line of sight , @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the relative abundance and @xmath12 the total hydrogen column density [ @xmath28 ( i.e. through the ism and csm , see below ) .",
    "then the optical depth , caused by the b ",
    "f absorptions within the x - ray domain , can be written in a convenient form as @xmath29 where @xmath30",
    "[ @xmath31 is the total cross - section for photoelectric absorption per hydrogen atom ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to correct the observed x - ray fluxes for absorptions i used the _ tbabs _ absorption model for ism composition with abundances given by @xcite ( e.g. @xmath32 ) .",
    "the minimum of @xmath12 is given by its ism component , @xmath12(ism ) .",
    "the csm component , @xmath12(csm ) , can be variable , depending on the activity of a sss and/or its composition . for example",
    ", an increase of the mass - loss rate from a sss leads to a decrease of the supersoft spectrum due to the b  f transitions , while the near - uv / optical spectrum brighten up throughout the f  b and f  f transitions , and vice versa .",
    "this effect is measured in some ssss ( see paperii ) .",
    "a nice example is ag  dra , which shows a strict anticorrelation between the supersoft x - ray and near - uv / optical fluxes @xcite . if a sss contains a strong source of the neutral hydrogen ( syxbs ) , the amount of b  f absorptions on the line of sight can vary with the orbital phase , when viewing the hot accreting source throughout a different amount of the neutral stellar wind from the giant .",
    "an example here is smc3 @xcite and the symbiotic binary 4  dra ( see fig  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "the above - mentioned examples imply that the amount of absorption between the observer and a sss can be _ variable _ due to its csm component .",
    "thus in the modelling the sed one has to consider that @xmath33 photons that are not capable of ionizing hydrogen are attenuated predominantly by scattering on the dust grains in the ism . in this case",
    "the light attenuation is given by the extinction curve , @xmath34 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , parametrized with the colour excess , @xmath35 , to the object .",
    "this correction to the observed fluxes , @xmath36 , for @xmath37  can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the so - called ` dereddened ' flux and the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the following sections",
    ", i will briefly introduce the radiative components of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fsss ] ) as observed at the earth , and will outline principles of the method of disentangling the composite continuum .",
    "it is understood that the radiation from ssss is produced by their ( pseudo)photospheres , and thus it is of stellar nature .",
    "a good example is the supersoft x - ray radiation generated by the wd photosphere as measured from novae during their sss phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also the supersoft x - ray radiation from ag  dra ( the strongest source among classical symbiotics ) was associated with the hot star photosphere @xcite , and later confirmed with the model sed by @xcite . for the sake of simplicity and with respect to the current modelling the low - resolution supersoft x - ray data , the observed fluxes from the hot stellar source ( i.e. the sss ) can be approximated with the blackbody radiation at a temperature @xmath41 , which is attenuated by b  f absorptions in the x - ray domain .",
    "then , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ftaux ] ) and ( [ eq : taux ] ) , the observed fluxes from the sss can be fitted with @xmath42 where the angular radius of the sss , @xmath43 , is given by its effective radius , @xmath44 ( i.e. the radius of a sphere with the same luminosity ) and the distance @xmath45 .",
    "fitting parameters here are @xmath19 , @xmath41 and @xmath12 , which define the luminosity of the sss as @xmath46 .",
    "if required , the blackbody fluxes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fhot ] ) can be replaced by a more sophisticated model of a hot stellar atmosphere or accretion disk .",
    "rayleigh scattering describes the absorption process , when an atom is excited to the _ intermediate _ state and is immediately stabilized by a transition to the same true bound state , re - emitting a photon of the same wavelength ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the effect is best observable for transitions from the ground state of hydrogen atom , i.e. around the lines of the hydrogen lyman series , where it can be identified as a strong attenuation of the continuum .",
    "its strength is therefore determined by the column density of neutral hydrogen between the emitting source and the observer , causing the optical depth in the continuum , @xmath47 where @xmath48 [ @xmath31 is the rayleigh cross - section for scattering by hydrogen in its ground state ( see eq .  ( 5 ) and fig .  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the attenuation of the far - uv spectrum by rayleigh scattering thus provides an independent estimate of @xmath12 .",
    "it measures exclusively the amount of neutral hydrogen within the ism .",
    "from this point of view , @xmath12 derived from fitting the x - ray data can be larger by the csm component than that obtained from fitting the rayleigh attenuated continuum ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : nh ] ) ) . in the case , when a sss does not produce any nebular emission ( e.g. rxj0439.8 - 6809 ) , @xmath12 values from both approaches should be equal .    for @xmath12 of a few @xmath49@xmath50",
    ", the effect of the rayleigh attenuation creates an absorption core with the zero rest intensity and fwhm@xmath51  around the ly-@xmath52 line .",
    "it is thus well measurable on medium / high resolution spectra ( e.g. by the hst / ghrs and fuse spectrograph ) , but hardly detectable on the low resolution iue spectra , because of influence of other absorption effects and the presence of the geocoronal ly-@xmath52 component . here",
    ", an example is shown for rxj0439.8 - 6809 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rx0439ray ] , also paper  ii ) .",
    "the nebular component of radiation in the uv / optical continuum can be approximated by processes of recombination and thermal bremsstrahlung in the circumstellar material ionized by the sss . in this case the energy distribution in the nebular continuum is determined by the total volume emission coefficient @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , i.e. the sum of contributions from recombination and bremsstrahlung for considered ions ( mostly h@xmath55 , he@xmath55 and he@xmath56 ) .",
    "its profile depends on the electron temperature , @xmath57 , and is a function of the wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the observed nebular flux can be expressed as a simple scaling of the emission coefficient , i.e. , @xmath58 according to the meaning of the @xmath53 coefficient , and assuming that @xmath57 and thus @xmath53 are constant throughout the nebula , the flux produced by the optically thin nebula ( i.e. the second term in eq .",

    "further fitting parameter is the electron temperature @xmath57 .",
    "selection of an appropriate emission coefficient @xmath53 depends on the properties of the nebula . to get the first estimate of the nebular parameters , contributions only from hydrogen plasma",
    "can be considered .",
    "also it is difficult to separate contributions from the he  continuum on the _ iue _ and _ hst _ spectra , because of a very similar profile of its recombination coefficients to that of h   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a small abundance . in the case of recognizable signatures of the he  continuum ( e.g.",
    "a jump in emission at @xmath622050  and a pronounced paschen series of the he  recombination lines ) , the emission coefficient @xmath63 should be used , with the possibility to estimate the abundance of he@xmath56 ions .",
    "finally , it is reasonable to assume that the nebula is sufficiently dense ( @xmath64@xmath65 ) , which excludes contributions due to the two - photon emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if a sss contains an m - type giant , its contribution usually rivals that from the nebula in the optical , but dominates the near - ir ( see figs .  2 - 22 of * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is satisfactory to figure the observed sed of the giant by the broad - band @xmath66 photometric fluxes . with respect to a large difference in the sed between a simple blackbody and the true giant s photosphere ,",
    "it is suggested to approximate the observed fluxes from the giant , @xmath67 , with an appropriate synthetic spectrum , @xmath68 .",
    "then we can write @xmath69 where the angular radius of the giant @xmath70 (= @xmath71 ) scales its emitted spectrum @xmath17 to that observed at the earth .",

    "the model corresponds to the luminosity @xmath226@xmath82 , @xmath227@xmath83  and @xmath228@xmath50 , which are similar to those given by the blackbody fit ( table  2 )",

    "in this paper i investigated the supersoft x - ray to near - ir sed of selected ssss with the aim to determine their physical parameters by disentangling their composite spectra ( table  2 ) . to model the global sed between @xmath6212  and @xmath625@xmath229 m",
    ", i used the multiwavelength modelling ( sect .  2 ) .",
    "this represents the main novelty of this paper .",
    "the method was demonstrated on two extragalactic ssss , the syxb lin  358 in the smc , a bright sss rxj0439.8 - 6809 in the lmc and two galactic ssss , the classical nova v1974  cyg during its supersoft phase and the classical symbiotic star ag  dra during its quiescent phase .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .    1 .   the models sed showed that the sss radiation dominates also the far - uv domain .",
    "with the exception of rxj0439.8 - 6809 , the modelling identified the _",
    "nebular _ component of radiation , which dominates the spectra from the mid - uv to longer wavelengths ( further conclusive examples are found in paper  ii of this series ) .",
    "2 .   the multiwavelength modelling the sed overcomes the problem of the mutual dependence between the @xmath187 , @xmath12 and @xmath41 parameters , which arises in modelling only the x - ray data .",
    "the multi - band fitting procedure allows to determine these parameters as independent variables ( sects .",
    "[ fig : mutual ] ) .",
    "3 .   the physical parameters of the global sed do not depend basically on the model used .",
    "a blackbody or an atmospheric model yield a similar luminosity , because they are nearly identical in the profile for @xmath222  and thus are equally scaled to the far - uv fluxes ( sects .",

    "an independent determination of the hydrogen column density in the ism , based on the rayleigh scattering the continuum photons around the ly-@xmath52 line , is suggested .",
    "values of @xmath12 obtained from modelling the sed and the rayleigh attenuated continuum are consistent ( sects .",
