    "the open quantum system approach is of much significance due to its various applications in physics , e.g. , quantum information , quantum transport , and quantum chemistry , etc . since a realistic quantum system",
    "is inevitably coupled to many degrees of freedom in its environment that leads to decoherence of the systems , a general approach to the open quantum system is needed for its dissipative and dephasing process .",
    "the dynamics of an open system is conventionally described with three approaches : effective hamiltonian  @xcite , quantum master equations  @xcite , and quantum langevin equations  @xcite .",
    "the last two approaches are both based on the modeling with system plus bath , while the first one is phenomenologically given by a time - dependent or non - hermitian hamiltonian , which could lead to the dissipative motion equations .",
    "about twenty years ago , yu and one ( c. p. s. ) of the authors revealed an intrinsic relation between the effective hamiltonian and quantum langevin equation , obtained from the heisenberg equations  @xcite . by discarding the quantum fluctuation for the wide wave packet , they derived the effective hamiltonian of the system through the formally exact solution for the time - dependent wave function of the total system .",
    "however , the resulting effective hamiltonian ignores the memory effect , which is induced by the back action of the bath with time delay .",
    "therefore , if one wanted to recover the non - markovian phenomenon with memory effect , the quantum fluctuation of the bath must be taken into account in the above heisenberg equation based approach . to this end",
    ", we need start from the heisenberg equations of the total system , which can reflect the original role of the bath . in this paper , without any approximation , we derive the exact non - markovian master equation of the system from the formal solution of the heisenberg equations . the non - markovian effect is contained in the time - dependent decay rates in a straightforward way  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that the markov process happens when the system - bath coupling is weak . however , with the rapid development of experimental technology , the strong - coupling limit can be reached .",
    "the theory of open quantum systems in the strong - coupling regime is required for a proper description of the non - markovian dynamics .",
    "recently , many works on exact quantum master equations have been done  @xcite . in particular",
    ", one ( w. m. z. ) of the authors and his collaborators derived the exact non - markovian master equations with a lindblad - form for both bose  @xcite and fermi  @xcite systems by a path - integral method in coherent - state representation .",
    "we now revisit these non - markovian master equations by generalizing our previous approach  @xcite , which was used to derive a partially factorized wave function for open quantum system .",
    "using the present generalization to derive the reduced density matrix is quite straightforward . here",
    ", we first construct the total density matrix with the help of the formal solution of the heisenberg equations , and then trace over the degrees of freedom of the bath to obtain the reduced density matrix of the system in the coherent state representation , instead of using the feynman - vernon influence functional , as was done in refs .",
    "it reproduces the same reduced density matrix that satisfies a time - local master equation where the non - markovian memory effect is fully taken into account .    with the help of the exact reduced density matrix",
    ", the dynamics of an open quantum system could be well described .",
    "meanwhile , there are several proposals to measure the degree of the non - markovianity of open quantum process  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the general non - markovian dynamics of the environment on its surrounding open quantum system are explored within the exact master equation  @xcite .",
    "the question is how to probe the general non - markovian dynamics .",
    "we thereby propose in this paper a promising approach to probe the time - dependent memory effect of a bath on a damped micro - cavity by coupling the cavity to a two - level atom dispersively . to probe the non - markovianity of the dissipation of the single model em field in a cavity , we let atoms of large detuning pass through the cavity . we found that the non - markovianity of the bath is explicitly reflected by the atomic decoherence factor . in the week coupling region , the periodically reviving amplitude decreases along with the cavity - bath coupling strength and decays to @xmath0 finally .",
    "on the the contrary , in the strong coupling region , the reviving amplitude increases with the coupling strength and almost does not decay in the ultra - strong coupling case , as a significant non - markovian effect  @xcite .",
    "this atomic decoherence factor could be detected through the ramsey interference in experiments .    in the next section ,",
    "we solve the heisenberg equations of the unified quantum system plus bath model ( bose and fermi ) and obtain their formal solutions . in sec .",
    "iii , the derivation of the exact master equation of bose system is presented .",
    "the exact master equation of fermi case is addressed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we propose to probe the non - markovian dynamics of a damped cavity with largely detuned two - level atoms . finally , the summery of our main results is given in sec .",

    "the coupling of @xmath1 to @xmath2 will lead to the dissipation and dephasing of @xmath1 .",
    "there are various types of bath , but the most commonly employed baths are modeled with non - interacting bosons and fermions . in this paper",
    "we consider the specific cases : a bose system is surrounded by a bose bath , or a fermi system is immersed in a fermi bath . here",
