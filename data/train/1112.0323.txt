    "gravitational lens magnification is a fast route to faint object and faint population studies .",
    "this technique has been exploited to reveal or constrain the populations responsible for integrated far - ir and submm extragalactic backgrounds ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smail et al .",
    "1997 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* knudsen et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "lensing is also one of the few available means of inferring the distribution of dark matter in galaxies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gavazzi et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "rare lens configurations even have the promise of yielding @xmath0 and @xmath1 to @xmath2 ; this requires @xmath3 double einstein rings , requiring in turn a parent sample of thousands of lenses ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gavazzi et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "indeed many current and future applications of lensing are limited by sample size ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* treu 2010 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , most lens surveys have selected strongly for foreground lenses at relatively low redshifts , e.g. @xmath4 , restricting studies of the evolving dark matter distribution in galaxies .",
    "these are strong drivers for both larger and higher redshift samples of lenses .",
    "the past year has seen an explosion of interest in submm - selected strong gravitational lenses , mainly driven by _",
    "herschel _ open and guaranteed time surveys and their follow - ups .",
    "new techniques pioneered with _",
    "herschel _ are capable of detecting lenses in much higher numbers and to much higher redshifts than previous optical / near - ir surveys such as slacs or slqs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bolton et al . 2006 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* oguri et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "this paper will briefly review some recent key infrared lensing results with a particular focus on the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions and on new data from _",
    "some of the first images made public from _ herschel _ were the spire guaranteed time @xmath5 m images of the galaxy cluster lens abell2218 .",
    "this well - known system is one of several to have been used to constrain the @xmath6 m background population ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* knudsen et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "recently , @xcite had also used the japanese _ akari _ facility to make its deepest @xmath7 m galaxy population constraints in this field , finding they could account for @xmath8 of the predicted extragalactic background at this wavelength . at the time of writing ,",
    "the spire data in this cluster has not been published despite the data release , but hopwood et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "have stacked the _",
    "akari _ population in the submm maps and found that at least @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of the background at @xmath11 m ( @xmath12 m ) is attributable directly to the @xmath7 m population . at far - ir wavelengths ,",
    "@xcite presented _ herschel _ guaranteed time pacs data of this cluster at @xmath13 m , demonstrating a constraint on the source counts comparable with that of the ultra - deep goods - north maps and accounting for @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the dirbe direct measurements at @xmath16 m and @xmath17 m respectively .",
    "the prospects are clearly excellent for more extensive _ herschel",
    "_ cluster lens work ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* egami et al . 2010 ) ) .",
    "gravitational lenses were originally hard to discover .",
    "for example , the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ) observed nearly 12,000 flat - spectrum radio sources , finding 16 lenses ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large public sdss database led to more rapid lens discovery ( e.g. @xcite ) , though at low lens redshifts by virtue of the selection criteria .",
    "the steep source counts in the submm imply a strong magnification bias . prior to _ herschel _",
    ", the expectation was that about @xmath18 of galaxies with @xmath11 m flux densities above @xmath19mjy would be lenses , with the remainder easily identifiable as local galaxies from optical imaging or as radio - loud agn from radio data ( @xcite ) .",
    "this prediction was supported by the mm - wave spt counts .",
    "spectacular confirmation came with the first _",
    "herschel _ candidates from h - atlas : in its first five lens candidates , @xcite showed clear evidence of 2-image and 4-image lensing configurations from sma data while keck imaging showed only a foreground elliptical .",
    "there were therefore 5 lenses from first 5 candidates !",
    "the technique is much more sensitive to higher - redshift foreground lenses than sdss - based selection and holds the promise of quickly and efficiently selecting large numbers of lenses .",
    "an associated breakthrough has been `` blind '' submm / mm - wave redshifts ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with z - spec ( cso ) and zpectrometer ( gbt ) , with iram confirmations .",
    "this finally circumvents the torturous process of multi - stage multi - wavelength cross - ids and exhaustive 8/10-m - class spectroscopic campaigns . for lensing systems",
    ", it provides rapid and unequivocal confirmation of a submm emitter background to the optical galaxy .",
    "the redshift determination of blind submm / mm - wave spectroscopy also makes follow - up far - ir and submm emission line diagnostics possible .",
    "spire fts observations of redshift @xmath20 h - atlas lens id81 by @xcite found first detection of @xmath21 m [ oiii ] line at @xmath22 .",
    "the high [ oiii]/far - ir ratio and the limit on [ oi]/[cii ] suggests an agn contributes ionizing radiation , as also suggested by the high radio / far - ir ratio .",
    "@xcite detect multiple co transitions and [ cii ] in the @xmath23 h - atlas galaxy sdpid141 ; their interpretation is of a pdr with a warm ( @xmath24k ) dense ( @xmath25@xmath26 ) gas , and the low line / far - ir ratio suggests again a high ionization parameter .",
    "progress in detecting these diagnostics is fast : @xcite present early results from high - density gas tracers in lensed submm galaxies , including hnc , hcn , hco@xmath27 and @xmath28co .",
    "@xcite detected an h@xmath29o transition in the @xmath30 h - atlas galaxy sdpid17 , arguing against a pdr on the grounds that the luminosity ratio @xmath31 is comparable to that of mrk231 .",
    "this , plus the fact that @xmath32 is greater than that of mrk231 , suggests the presence of an agn .",
    "@xcite detected four rotational h@xmath29o transitions in the @xmath33 lensed quasar apm08279 + 5255 , inferring the presence of warm gas ( @xmath34k ) .",
    "an immediate corollary of both detections is that alma will detect h@xmath29o in many more submm lenses .",
    "early work on the seds of the submm lenses found the background sources are very difficult or impossible to detect in optical imaging , while _",
    "@xmath35 m data can be used to detect the background sources ( * ? ? ? * ( hopwood et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "the immediate corollary is that _ there is a class of lenses that are missed entirely in optically - selected samples_. the first hst data on these lenses ( negrello et al . in prep . )",
    "finds the first submm - selected einstein rings , and with the benefit of the prior from the hst imaging , faint features can now be discerned in the ground - based imaging .",
    "submm galaxies are known to have a wide variety of colours and obscurations so one might expect many to be detectable by _ euclid _ at least in its near - infrared channel .",
    "the _ herschel _",
    "samples will be a crucial training set for strong lens discovery in _",
    "@xcite derived the submm luminosity function ( lf ) of h - atlas galaxies at using a far - ir / submm colour - based photometric redshift estimator , calibrated against redshift determinations from co spectroscopy . local spiral galaxies and",
    "lensed sources were eliminating by rejecting galaxies with optical ifs .",
    "the derived evolving lf agrees with the predictions of an updated version of the @xcite model .",
    "the steepness of the bright - end slope of the submm lf , together with the submm k - corrections , are the underlying causes of the steepness of the submm source counts .",
    "however the steepness of the lf suggests a means to improve the efficiency of the lens selection , and to extend it to fainter submm fluxes : if one can select galaxies at the bright end of the _ luminosity function _ then they should be prone to magnification bias in a similar way to the bright submm source counts . to do this",
    "requires relaxing the constraint in the @xcite analysis of rejecting galaxies with optical ids . instead , @xcite use a high - redshift selection of submm galaxies based on their far - ir / submm colours , then use viking near - ir data and search for optical / submm photometric inconsistencies .",
    "this approach has led to the discoveries of lens candidates fainter than the @xmath36mjy @xmath11 m flux threshold of @xcite .",
    "the source counts of their lens candidates agree with magnification bias predictions of the @xcite luminosity functions . extrapolating to the full h - atlas survey",
    ", the authors estimate an astonishing @xmath37 strong lenses can be reliably detected in h - atlas alone , several times more than from using a simple monochromatic submm flux cut .",
    "gravitational lensing is purely geometrical and therefore wavelength - independent .",
    "none - theless , in any astrophysical lens the magnification varies with position in the source plane , so if the background source is extended with intrinsic colour gradients , then the lensed source may have colours different to the unlensed case .",
    "this differential magnification could have a very significant effect on broad - band seds as well as on emission line diagnostics .",
    "many authors assume , implicitly or explicitly , that these differential effects can be neglected , but this assumption is often wholly unjustified .",
    "* serjeant ( 2011 ) ) makes a statistical assessment of differential magnification for various photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics , a range of source redshifts and a constant comoving density of lenses .",
    "here , i present the special case of a lens redshift ( @xmath38 ) and source redshift ( @xmath39 ) identical to those in the lens system irasf10214 + 4724 .",
    "the model background source is based on the cosmic eyelash ( @xcite ) , qso1148 + 5251 ( @xcite ) and mrk231 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are three continuum components : an agn , a starburst and cirrus , with relative bolometric fractions of 0.3:0.5:0.2 .",
    "the agn has a torus sed from @xcite peaking in the mid - ir , modelled as a circular region with @xmath40kpc radius .",
    "the starburst region is concentrated in four identical @xmath3pc - radius gmcs as per the cosmic eyelash , with a starburst sed from @xcite .",
    "the cirrus is an extended ellipse with @xmath41kpc major axis , ellipticity of @xmath42 and a cirrus sed from @xcite .",
    "there are also emission line regions : a cool co region tracing the cirrus with clumps modelled in the lvg approximation with a kinetic temperature of @xmath43k , density @xmath36@xmath26 , co column @xmath44@xmath45 and an external background temperature of @xmath46k ; warm co regions with @xmath42kpc radii centred on the gmcs , with lvg model temperatures of @xmath47k , densities @xmath48@xmath26 and co column @xmath49@xmath45 ; a circular warm h@xmath29o region with @xmath50pc radius and a cool h@xmath29o region with major axis @xmath51kpc ( both h@xmath29o regions follow the precedent of mrk231 ) ; a circular [ cii ] emission region offset by @xmath52kpc from the agn , with a radius of @xmath53kpc , following the precedent of qsoj1148 + 5251 .",
    "the foreground lens is modelled as the sum of a de vaucouleurs profile and a navarro - frenk - white profile , both typical of the slacs population .",
    "the simulation is conducted at a resolution of @xmath54 .",
    "a clear result of these simulations is that the apparent bolometric fractions of strong lenses ( magnification @xmath55 ) depend very strongly on the selection wavelength .",
    "fig.[fig : ternary ] shows the bolometric fractions for a simulated lensed galaxy selected at @xmath56 m and at @xmath11 m , while fig.[fig : h2o ] ( left ) shows the agn bolometric fraction for the lensed galaxies selected at these wavelengths . at this source redshift , @xmath56 m ( observed - frame )",
    "is close to the peak of the agn bolometric output , while observations at @xmath11 m predominantly sample the star - forming and cirrus components .",
    "clearly the probability distribution of the agn bolometric fraction depends very strongly on the selection wavelength , though some lens configurations are common to both wavelengths .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]    another striking result is that the warm and cool h@xmath29o regions are also subject to differential magnification , at least in strongly - lensed systems ( magnifications @xmath55 ) .",
    "fig.[fig : h2o ] shows the relative magnification factors of the warm and cool h@xmath29o emission line regions .",
    "these components contribute a similar flux in mrk231 for upper energy levels under @xmath60k , while the warm component dominates at higher temperatures .",
    "there is clearly a long tail in fig.[fig : h2o ] in which the warm component is boosted relative to the cooler , more extended component .",
    "a similar tail is present in the h@xmath29o _ vs. _ @xmath11 m magnifications , and in h@xmath29o _ vs. _ gmcs .",
    "the presence of this tail provides an alternative explanation for the detection of h@xmath29o ( @xmath61 ) in an h - atlas galaxy ( @xcite ) because @xmath62 of the flux of this line in mrk231 comes from the compact warm component .",
    "having said that , at moderate magnifications ( @xmath57 ) there are no appreciable differential magnification effects in the h@xmath29o lines .",
    "differential magnification also affects the observed bolometric fraction of the [ cii ] line ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in this case the bolometric fractions vary by @xmath63dex , comparable to the measurement uncertainties . simulating the [ c ii ] and co line diagnostic diagram in @xcite ( not shown )",
    ", it appears that the dynamic range of the diagnostic is much larger than that of the differential magnification effects , so this diagnostic is only weakly affected by differential lensing .",
    "finally , there is a serious distortion of the co ladder .",
    "fig[fig : co ] shows the predicted lensed co spectral line energy distributions ( sleds ) , compared to that of the underlying background source .",
    "this time , even moderate - magnification systems are affected .",
    "the warm co is located very close to the gmcs in the model galaxy , but this does not necessarily guarantee that the warm co is boosted relative to the cool component , even if selecting at @xmath11 m . unlike the case of the [ cii ] and co line diagnostic diagram in @xcite , the useful dynamic range of the co sled is much smaller , making it much more sensitive to differential magnification effects .",
    "lenses ( shown ) and @xmath57 lenses .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   lenses ( shown ) and @xmath57 lenses .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    differential magnification is therefore a serious problem if its effects are not accounted for .",
    "both the sed and emission line ratios are significantly distorted in galaxies with magnifications @xmath55 , and the co sled is very strongly distorted in any system with @xmath64 .",
    "however if a foreground mass model is available and the source is resolved , it can nevertheless work to our advantage .",
    "lensing conserves surface brightness , so regions of high magnification are subject to angular magnification .",
    "this may , for example , provide uniquely high angular resolution views of active nuclei or star - forming regions in infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "observations by alma or emerlin will easily detect lens morphologies , and an emerlin legacy survey follow - up of submm - selected lenses is already underway .",
    "these results are robust to changes in the assumed configuration of the background source",
    ". only if the background source is broadly homogeneous could strong differential magnification effects be avoided .",
    "one might argue that the number of gmc regions could be much larger , e.g. to resemble those in @xmath65 spiral discs ( and at variance with observations of high - redshift infrared - luminous galaxies ) , but an active nucleus will inevitably create a colour gradient in the background source .",
    "@xcite shows that the same effects are present for a constant comoving population of lenses , generalising the fixed lens redshift of @xmath38 in this paper , and for different source redshifts .",
    "galaxy cluster lenses are a rapid route to probing the populations dominating the cosmic infrared backgrounds , both through direct detections and stacking analyses .",
    "the bulk of the observed or predicted cosmic infrared backgrounds at @xmath7 m , @xmath16 m , @xmath17 m and @xmath6 m have now been resolved into individual sources through ultra - deep imaging in the fields of foreground gravitationally - lensing galaxy clusters .",
    "meanwhile , there is a clear need for larger numbers of strong galaxy - galaxy lens systems , particularly at higher lens redshifts . following the spectacular confirmation of the @xmath66 gravitational lens selection efficiency from submm - selected lenses",
    ", there is now a tremendous scope for such lens discovery in the submm with _",
    "a further breakthrough has been `` blind '' submm / mm - wave redshift determination , i.e. without recourse to the torturous multi - stage multi - wavelength cross - identification and long - term 8m/10m - class optical / near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "emission line diagnostics already yielding constraints on the physical conditions in these lensed galaxies .",
    "however , differential magnification effects can not be neglected .",
    "in particular , the observed co sled in any lensed system can easily be un - representative of the sled in the underlying source .",
    "furthermore , the uncorrected bolometric fractions of strongly - lensed galaixes ( magnifications @xmath55 ) inferred from broad - band seds are so unreliable as to be useless .",
