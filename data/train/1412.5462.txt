    "the theme of granular chains has gained considerable traction over the past decade , perhaps to a large measure due to the significant advances in corresponding experimental techniques complementing theoretical and numerical investigations  @xcite .",
    "while traveling waves in these extensively tunable ( regarding , e.g. , their homogeneous or heterogeneous , weakly or strongly nonlinear nature ) media have received the lion s share of the corresponding attention , numerous other excitations have been examined more recently as well including , but not limited to , defect modes , bright and dark breathers , and shock waves , among others ; see e.g.  @xcite for some characteristic examples .",
    "a key feature supporting this explosive rate of development has been the versatile use of such settings in a diverse host of applications including e.g. , actuating devices @xcite , acoustic lenses  @xcite , mechanical diodes  @xcite , logic gates  @xcite and sound scramblers @xcite .",
    "the principal theme of robust , highly localized traveling stress waves in such a setting has received arguably the most attention , as it has posed significant mathematical challenges and has proved fruitful in a diverse array of applications including , among others , e.g. the quantification of bone - quality in biomedical applications  @xcite or the monitoring of hydration of gypsum cement  @xcite . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the existence of such waves , originally established in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , was rigorously proved in  @xcite by means of the variational approach of  @xcite .",
    "however , the non - constructive nature of this proof offered no information on the solutions profile . their single pulse character ( in the strain variables of the system ) was subsequently established rigorously in  @xcite , following the approach of  @xcite .",
    "these approaches also enabled the identification of the doubly exponential character of their spatial decay in the absence of the so - called precompression ( i.e. , of linear part within the system dynamics ) ; see also for earlier relevant asymptotic analyses predicting this rate of spatial decay  @xcite .    while this part of the story is admittedly well - understood in the context of the standard one - component , homogeneous granular chain , in recent years , a number of intriguing variants have emerged on this theme which may possess more elaborate structural characteristics as regards their traveling waves ( and other related structures ) .",
    "chronologically , an earlier example of this form consists of the so - called cradle system ( of which we are not aware of an experimental realization as of yet ) proposed in  @xcite and further explored , including by detailed direct numerical computations in  @xcite . there , a local , linear oscillator",
    "was added to the granular chain , emulating the pendulum restoring effect in the well - known newton s cradle . in that context ,",
    "numerous unexpected features arose including the formation of waves with persistent tails , of traveling ( time - periodic ) breathers , of apparently direction - reversing ( so - called boomeron - type ) structures , etc .",
    "while many of these observations have yet to be explained , here we will actually turn our attention to another class of systems , the so - called locally resonant granular crystals , otherwise known as mass - in - mass ( mim ) or mass - with - mass ( mwm ) systems .",
    "the mim and mwm systems are rapidly gaining an increasing amount of interest chiefly because they have already been experimentally realized in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "admittedly , both of these realizations were chiefly linear ( in the presence of externally imposed pre - compression of the chain ) and aiming to illustrate the remarkable meta - material type properties that these systems possess . yet , while a mwm nonlinear prototype was also demonstrated in  @xcite , it was a different type of experiment that very recently realized highly nonlinear propagation in a locally resonant granular system  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the experiment of  @xcite built a so - called woodpile configuration consisting of orthogonally - stacked rods ( every second rod is aligned , in this alternating 0 - 90 degree configuration ) and demonstrated that the internal vibrations of the rods can play the role of the local resonator within the granular chain .",
    "it was also shown that depending on the properties of the system ( i.e. , the length of the rods ) , one can controllably incorporate one or more such resonators , yet here our focus will be in the case of a single such resonator .",
    "a remarkable find of these locally resonant , highly nonlinear such chains was found to be the propagation of traveling waves with an apparently non - decaying tail  @xcite .",
    "it was indeed found that the tail behind the wave may persist in small amplitude oscillations ( in the experiment they were found to potentially be three order of magnitude smaller than the core of the traveling wave ) which , however , do not decay and which bear a clear frequency / wavenumber , namely that of the of out - of - phase vibration between the principal and the resonating mass in such a system . weakly nonlocal solitary waves have been studied extensively in a series of examples in physical sciences and engineering  @xcite , yet very few ( especially so , highly experimentally controllable ) realizations thereof are known to exist .",
    "our aim in the present work is to examine more systematically such traveling waves from a theoretical perspective .",
    "we will use three distinct approaches in order to identify this important class of solutions for the mim / mwm systems .",
    "we will seek them directly as traveling waves in real space , by attempting to identify fixed points of a discretization of the co - traveling frame nonlinear problem in our direct method .",
    "we will also follow the approach of  @xcite , rewriting the problem in fourier space ( upon a fourier transform ) and seeking fixed points of that variant upon inverse fourier transform , similarly to  @xcite .",
    "this will recover a convolution based reformulation of the problem in real space .",
    "finally , the third method will recognize the limitations of the infinite domain formulation of the above convolution problem and will instead restrict consideration to a finite lattice , using fourier series rather than fourier trasnforms .",
    "the presentation of the three methods will take place in section ii below .",
    "these methods will be explored in a _ finite domain _ setting yielding convergence to exact traveling waves under suitable conditions that will be explicitly analyzed .",
    "in addition to the , arguably more tractable , pulse - like solutions of the so - called strain variant of the problem , we will also translate the results at the level of bead displacements .",
    "relevant numerical results will be given in section iii of the manuscript , along with some of the nontrivial associated challenges of the computations and impact of parametric variations on the resulting waves . in that process , a particularly interesting feature will be identified ( and subsequently explained ) , namely for an isolated , countably infinite set of parameters the problem will no longer possess the oscillating tails described above , but rather the symmetric , monotonically decaying tails of the standard granular chain .",
    "finally , in section iv , we will summarize our findings and present some potential directions for future work .",
    "our starting point will consist of a hertzian chain  @xcite of identical beads with the displacement of the @xmath0 bead from the original position denoted by @xmath1 . for the @xmath0 bead @xmath2",
    ", we attach a local resonator , effectively coupling it to another kind of bead ( the `` in - mass ''  @xcite or the `` with - mass ''  @xcite discussed above ) , whose displacement from the original position is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "notice that in the case of the woodpile configuration , this does not constitute a separate mass but rather reflects the internal vibrational modes of the woodpile rods  @xcite .",
    "here we use @xmath4 to stand for the spring constant and @xmath5 reflects the ratio of two kinds of masses ( or more generally , the effective mass of the locally resonant mode ) . with these assumptions , we write our model of the mim / mwm problem as follows : @xmath6 here @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the initial pre - compression between beads , while @xmath9 is determined by the hertzian interaction .    focusing on traveling wave solutions of the above system",

    "the difficulties existing in each case were identified and explored , including the limitations of the fourier transform ( which is restricted to the anti - resonance case ) and of the fourier series , the need for a suitable initial guess for the first method and the boundary conditions thereof , as well as the issue of converting the strain into a displacement formulation .",
    "we explored how the use of finite domains under generic non - resonance conditions may enable the convergence of the third scheme ( and how the anti - resonance enables the convergence of the second scheme to a similar solution ) .",
    "we then used good initial guesses from these schemes to lead to convergent solutions of the first scheme and were able to reconstruct based on that also the corresponding displacement profiles .",
    "an interesting byproduct of the parametric variations considered was the ability to identify anti - resonance parameter values for which the generic existence of tails ( in our weakly nonlocal solitary waves ) was annulled , enabling the identification of regular , monotonically decaying ( on each side ) solitary waves .",
    "while we believe that the above analysis may shed a partial light on the identification of traveling solitary wave solutions , there remains a sizable number of open problems in this direction . among the significant challenges posed by the experimental observations of",
    "@xcite we note the following . for different parameter values than for the ones where the weakly nonlocal solutions were identified , it was found that a breathing while traveling behavior was possible .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to try to identify such breathing traveling waves and to explore the recurrence type of dynamics that appears to lead to their formation .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite , the nature of experimental excitations led to the formation of single - sided ( i.e. , bearing tails only one side ) tails .",
    "exploring the potential of such exact solutions is an interesting question in its own right .",
    "another aspect that was briefly explored in  @xcite was the inclusion of a higher number of resonators . in the case of more resonators , the possibility of steady ( or even breathing ) traveling waves was found to be less typical .",
    "instead , it was found that decay of the original pattern s amplitude was the most commonly observed scenario . identifying these cases from the dynamical systems / fourier analysis perspective offer presented herein and",
