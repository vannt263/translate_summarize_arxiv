    "the correlation function of clusters of galaxies provides a powerful test of cosmological models : both the amplitude of the correlation function and its dependence on cluster mass / richness are determined by the underlying cosmology .",
    "it has long been shown that clusters are more strongly correlated in space than galaxies  by an order - of - magnitude : the typical galaxy correlation scale of @xmath14 5 @xmath9 mpc increases to @xmath14 20 - 25 @xmath9 mpc for the richest clusters ( @xcite , see also @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the cluster correlation function is richness dependent : the correlation strength increases with cluster richness , or mass .",
    "the rarest , most massive clusters exhibit the strongest spatial correlations .",
    "many observations have since confirmed these results ( see references above ) , and theory has nicely explained them ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "all analyses so far have been done at small redshifts , @xmath15 .",
    "as cluster samples become available at larger redshifts , it is important to determine the expected evolution of the cluster correlation function and the evolution of its richness dependence as a function of redshift ; these will provide direct cosmological predictions for comparisons with the data .",
    "analytic approximations for the evolution of cluster halo abundance , bias and clustering have been presented by several groups @xcite . here",
    "we use direct n - body cosmological simulations to determine the expected evolution of the cluster correlation function and present the results in a format suitable for direct comparison with observations .",
    "we use large - scale high - resolution cosmological simulations to investigate the evolution of the cluster correlation function from @xmath0 to @xmath1 over a wide range of cluster masses .",
    "we determine the evolution of the richness dependence of the cluster correlation function over the same redshift range .",
    "the simulations use a standard flat lcdm model which best fits numerous other observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for comparison , we also investigate the evolution of the cluster correlation function in an @xmath3 tilted scdm model .",
    "the high - resolution n - body simulations use a standard flat lambda cdm cosmology with @xmath2 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . for comparison",
    ", we also investigate an @xmath3 tilted scdm model ( tscdm ; with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the simulations are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "a brief summary is given below .",
    "the simulations employ @xmath22 particles in a periodic cube , with a particle mass of @xmath23 m@xmath24 .",
    "a larger simulation with @xmath25 particles and one eighth the particle mass was also investigated for comparison ; it yields consistent results .",
    "the box length is 1000 @xmath9 mpc for the lcdm model ( 669.4 @xmath9 mpc for tscdm ) .",
    "the spline kernel softening length is 27 @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the spatial resolution is comfortably smaller than the typical @xmath14100 kpc core size of clusters .",
    "the n - body evolution was carried out with the tree - particle - mesh ( tpm ) code @xcite .",
    "these are among the largest volume simulations currently available .",
    "clusters were selected in the simulations using the hop algorithm for the detection of high - density peaks @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "cluster masses are defined within a comoving radius of 1.5 @xmath9 mpc of the cluster center .",
    "cluster masses within other fixed radii yield similar results . clusters with mass threshold of m@xmath26 m@xmath24  ( within comoving radius 1.5 @xmath9 mpc ) are selected at redshifts @xmath27 = 0 , 0.17 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the number of clusters used ranges from @xmath28 clusters ( for @xmath27 = 0 , m@xmath29 m@xmath24 ) to @xmath30 clusters for the highest mass , highest redshift clusters . the abundance of lcdm clusters ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 mpc@xmath33 for m@xmath29 and @xmath34 m@xmath24  at @xmath27 = 0 ) is consistent with recent observations of sdss and x - ray clusters @xcite . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we determine the two - point spatial correlation function of clusters at different redshifts as a function of cluster mass threshold .",
    "the comoving mass thresholds range from m@xmath26 m@xmath24  ( within 1.5 @xmath9 comoving mpc ) to @xmath35 m@xmath24 .",
    "the redshifts investigated range from @xmath27 = 0 to 3 .",
    "the correlation function is determined for each sample by comparing the observed distribution of cluster pairs as a function of pair separation with the distribution in random catalogs within the same volume : @xmath36 , where @xmath37(@xmath38 ) and @xmath39(@xmath38 ) are the frequencies of cluster - cluster pairs as a function of pair separation @xmath38 in the data and in random catalogs , respectively .",
    "the number of clusters decreases with increasing mass and redshift , from @xmath28 to @xmath40 clusters ; the most massive ( rarest ) clusters are therefore studied only at the lower part of the redshift range .",
    "since the cluster abundance in a tscdm model decreases more rapidly with redshift than in lcdm , this model is only studied up to @xmath41 .",
    "poisson statistical error - bars are used in the correlation function analysis .",
    "comoving scales and a hubble constant of h@xmath42 mpc@xmath43 are used throughout .",
    "the evolution of the cluster correlation function as a function of redshift is illustrated in figure 1 for lcdm for two mass threshold samples ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 m@xmath24 ) .",
    "the best - fit power - law correlation function , @xmath46(@xmath38 ) = ( @xmath47)@xmath48 , is also presented for each sample .",
    "the best fits are derived for scales @xmath49 mpc .",
    "the power - law slope was treated both as a free parameter and as a fixed value of @xmath50 ; the latter is the typical slope found in the simulations .",
    "the best - fits shown in figure 1 are for a fixed slope @xmath50 .",
    "the results are similar for a free slope fit , as discussed below .",
    "the evolution of the cluster correlation function is apparent in figure 1 : clusters are more strongly correlated at higher redshift .",
    "this is of course opposite to the evolution of the mass correlation function , which decreases with redshift .",
    "the enhancement of the cluster correlation strength with redshift is due to the increased bias of the clusters relative to the underlying mass distribution : i.e. , the same comoving mass clusters represent higher density peaks of the mass distribution as the redshift increases thus amplifying their correlation strength ( see , for example , @xcite )    figure 2 presents the best - fit correlation function slope @xmath51 as a function of cluster redshift and cluster mass .",
    "the best slope for lcdm is @xmath52 for @xmath15 clusters .",
    "the slope steepens by @xmath53 , to @xmath54 , as the redshift increases to @xmath55 .",
    "this steepening can also be seen in the correlation function of the high - redshift samples in figure 1 .",
    "the tscdm model ( figure 2b ) yields a slightly steeper average slope : @xmath14 2.3 at @xmath15 , increasing only slightly to @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "the evolution of the cluster correlation function is presented in figure 3 for clusters with different mass thresholds .",
    "the figure illustrates the dependence of the comoving correlation scale , @xmath4 , on redshift .",
    "the results are shown for a correlation slope of 2 as well as for a free fit slope .",
    "as expected , the slight steepening of the best - fit slope at high redshift causes the correlation scale at high redshift to be somewhat smaller than for @xmath50 . the changing slope does not change the main evolutionary trend of @xmath4(@xmath27 ) .",
    "two main results are apparent in figure 3 : a ) the cluster correlation scale increases with redshift ; b ) the evolutionary increase of the correlation scale is stronger for the more massive clusters as well as at higher redshifts ; low mass and low redshift clusters show only a small increase of @xmath4 with @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the low mass sample with m@xmath29 m@xmath24   increases its correlation scale from @xmath58 mpc at @xmath0 to @xmath59 mpc at @xmath41 and @xmath60 mpc at @xmath1 ( for lcdm ) , while m@xmath61 m@xmath24  clusters increase their @xmath4 from @xmath62 mpc at @xmath0 to @xmath63 mpc at @xmath41 .",
    "the tscdm model ( figure 3b ) shows a similar ( but faster ) increase of @xmath4 with @xmath27 .",
    "as expected , the @xmath4 values of the tscdm model are smaller than those of lcdm ( at low redshift ) .",
    "the observed increase of the correlation scale with cluster mass threshold seen in figure 3 is the well - known richness - dependence of the cluster correlation function @xcite .",
    "the strengthening of the cluster correlations with redshift implies that the cluster bias increases with redshift more strongly than the mass correlations decrease with redshift .",
    "the cluster correlation stength increases with both cluster mass and cluster redshift . here",
    "we combine the two by investigating the evolution of the richness - dependent cluster correlation function .",
    "we present the richness - dependent correlation function as the dependence of the correlation scale @xmath4 on the cluster mean separation @xmath5 ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "samples with intrinsically larger mean separation correspond to lower intrinsic cluster abundance ( @xmath64 ) and thus to higher cluster richness and mass ( for complete samples ) .",
    "since the cluster mass does not enter this relation , the predictions can be easily compared with observations .    in figure 4",
    "we present the @xmath65 relation for different redshifts for the lcdm and tscdm models .",
    "a fixed correlation function slope of @xmath50 is used . remarkably , the richness - dependent correlation function , @xmath65 , is independent of redshift for @xmath6 for lcdm and @xmath7 for tscdm .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath65 relation with redshift is small when a fixed slope ( @xmath50 ) is used in determining @xmath4 . for a free fit slope ( lcdm ;",
    "figure 5 ) , the correlation scales at high redshift are slightly lower due to the steepening of the slope @xmath51 at high @xmath27 .",
    "this results in a small amount of evolution in the @xmath65 relation for @xmath66 mpc , where the amplitude of the relation decreases by @xmath67 as the redshift increases from @xmath0 to @xmath68 ( figure 5 ; to @xmath69 mpc ) .",
    "the @xmath65 relation for the tscdm model remains essentially un - evolving for @xmath70 for both fixed and free slopes ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the best - fit slope for this model changes only slightly with redshift ( figure 2 ) .",
    "using a slope of 2.3 instead of 2 makes only a small difference in the @xmath65 relation ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the @xmath65 relation evolves at @xmath10 for lcdm ( @xmath50 ) , where the amplitude of the relation declines .",
    "the same is suggested for tscdm at @xmath11 .",
    "the above results use cluster masses defined within a fixed comoving radius ( 1.5 @xmath9 mpc ) ; these masses are observationally easy to determine . using cluster virial masses ( or friend - of - friend masses to a given mass - density threshold ) , which are observationally more difficult to determine , yield similar results but with slightly more evolution at large @xmath5 s ( @xmath67 decrease in the @xmath65 amplitude as the redshift increases from @xmath0 to 2 for lcdm with @xmath50 , and @xmath71 decrease for a free - fit slope ) .",
    "only little evolution is seen for @xmath7 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the @xmath65 relation is slightly lower ( @xmath67 ) at small separations ( @xmath73 mpc ) for these masses , but with no significant evolution to @xmath7 .",
    "an analysis of the clustering in @xmath74= 1 mixed dark matter models @xcite similarly yields an @xmath65 relation that is essentially the same at @xmath0 and @xmath75 .",
    "the results presented here , for cluster masses within a fixed comoving radius , can be directly compared with observations ; the latter are to be defined in a similar manner .",
    "a higher resolution lcdm simulation with @xmath25 particles yields consistent results ( within @xmath76 for @xmath77 mpc and @xmath78 ( @xmath14 2-@xmath79 level ) for @xmath80 mpc ) with those presented in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the remarkable constancy of the @xmath65 relation to these high redshifts , with no significant evolution , implies that the increased cluster correlation strength with redshift ( figure 3 ) is matched by the increased mean separation @xmath5 ( i.e. , lower cluster abundance ) so that the @xmath65 relation remains essentially unchanged . for a given mass cluster ,",
    "the cluster abundance decreases with redshift ; the decrease is rapid for low @xmath81 models and slow for high @xmath81 models ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the cluster mean separation @xmath5 therefore increases with redshift , as expected .",
    "the evolution of the cluster correlation scale @xmath4 depends on the combined evolution of the underlying mass correlation function ( which decreases with increasing redshift : the decrease is rapid for @xmath3 models and slower for low @xmath74 models ) , and the evolution of the cluster bias relative to the underlying mass distribution .",
    "the cluster bias increases with redshift : the same mass clusters represent higher density peaks at high redshift .",
    "the bias increases more rapidly for high @xmath74 models than for lower @xmath74 models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the combined effect of the decreasing mass correlation strength and the increasing cluster bias with redshift ( for same mass clusters ) results in an increasing cluster correlation scale with redshift as seen in figure 3 .",
    "the increased @xmath4(@xmath27 ) matches the increase in the mean separation @xmath5(@xmath27 ) in the relative @xmath65 relation ( for @xmath50 ) . since @xmath82 ( see below ) , @xmath4(@xmath27 ) increases roughly as @xmath5(@xmath27)@xmath83 .",
    "the same mass clusters therefore shift upwards along the @xmath65 relation , to larger @xmath5 and larger @xmath4 , as the redshift increases . at some high redshift ( @xmath84 for lcdm ; @xmath57 for tscdm )",
    "the drop in cluster abundance ( increase in @xmath5 ) becomes considerably stronger than the increase in clustering scale @xmath4 , and the amplitude of the @xmath65 relation declines as seen in figure 4 .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the precise value of @xmath81 ; the @xmath65 relation changes by @xmath67 at low redshifts as @xmath81 changes from 0.9 to 0.7 ( values within this range are suggested by recent observations ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the redshift at which evolution in the @xmath65 relation becomes significant is expected to depend on @xmath81 ; the detailed dependance needs to be investigated by simulations .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath65 relation provides an important cosmological tool .",
    "the results can be used for direct comparison with observations at any redshift ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "no significant evolution in the @xmath65 relation is expected to @xmath6 ( using @xmath50 and cluster mass within fixed comoving radius ) if the current lcdm model is correct .",
    "an approximation for the @xmath65 relation for lcdm is given by ( see @xcite ) : @xmath86 where all scales are in comoving @xmath9 mpc .",
    "this approximation holds for all @xmath6 clusters ( using a slope @xmath50 and cluster mass within fixed comoving radius ) in the range @xmath87 mpc .",
    "as cluster samples become available at high redshift , this comparison should provide an important test of the lcdm cosmology .",
    "observations of the cluster correlation function at @xmath12 have been influential in cosmology ; they provided some of the earliest evidence that contradicted the then standard @xmath3 model and indicated a low - density universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but the @xmath12 data are insufficient by themselves to place a precise constraint on the cosmological parameters .",
    "this is so not only because of the observational scatter among different samples , but mainly because the @xmath12 relation is degenerate with respect to different cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , the amplitude of the @xmath65 relation at @xmath12 increases with increasing @xmath81 but it also increases with decreasing @xmath74 ; models with higher @xmath81 and higher @xmath74 yield degenerate results with models of lower @xmath81 and lower @xmath74 .",
    "the slope of the power - spectrum of mass fluctuation introduces yet another free parameter in the degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by studying the evolution of the @xmath65 relation to high redshifts , since the evolution depends differently on the combination of the cosmological parameters . while other independent observations can also be used  such as the cluster mass function and its evolution , and the cmb spectrum of fluctuations ",
    "the @xmath65 ( @xmath27 ) evolution provides an independent consistency test that uses a single self - consistent method of cluster correlations .",
    "we use large - scale high - resolution cosmological simulations to determine the evolution of the cluster correlation function with redshift from @xmath0 to @xmath1 over a wide range of cluster masses .",
    "two cosmological models are studied : the standard flat lcdm model ( with @xmath2 ) , which best fits numerous observations , and , for comparison , a tilted @xmath3 model ( tscdm ) .",
    "the evolutionary predictions are presented in a format suitable for direct comparisons with observations .",
    "we find that the cluster correlation strength increases with redshift for fixed mass clusters ; i.e. , clusters are more strongly clustered in space at high redshift .",
    "the evolutionary increase of the correlation scale with redshift ( in comoving units ) is faster for more massive clusters and at higher redshift .",
    "the increased clustering of clusters at high redshift , in spite of the decreased clustering of the underlying mass distribution , is due to the strongly increasing bias of clusters at high redshift : clusters represent higher - density peaks of the mass distribution at higher redshift .",
    "the increased bias dominates over the decreasing mass correlations and causes the clustering of clusters to increase .",
    "we combine the evolution of the cluster correlation function with its dependence on cluster mass by determining the evolution of the richness - dependent cluster correlation function .",
    "we do so using the format of the correlation scale versus mean separation relation , @xmath65 .",
    "this relation is easy to compare with observations .",
    "samples with intrinsically larger mean separations correspond to lower intrinsic cluster abundances and thus to higher cluster richness and mass ( for complete samples ) . we find that , remarkably , the richness - dependent cluster correlation function @xmath65 is independent of redshift for these models for @xmath6 for lcdm ( using a fixed correlation function slope and cluster mass defined within a fixed comoving radius ) and @xmath7 for tscdm ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath65 relation begins to decline only at @xmath10 for lcdm and @xmath11 for tscdm . using a free correlation slope fit , or virial cluster masses , yields similar results but with a small amount of evolution ( @xmath71 to @xmath6 for lcdm ) .",
    "the non - evolving @xmath65 relation implies that the strengthening of the cluster correlation function with redshift is matched by the relevant increase in the mean separation at high redshift ( lower cluster abundance ) .",
    "the same mass clusters shift upwards along the @xmath65 relation as the redshift increases : both the comoving clustering scale and the cluster mean separation increase with redshift so that the @xmath65 relation remains essentially unchanged . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the lcdm relation follows approximately @xmath88 ( comoving scales ) .    the evolution of the @xmath65 relation to high redshift provides an important new cosmological tool .",
    "the observed evolution of the relation from @xmath89 to @xmath13 can be used to break degeneracies that exist at @xmath12 and thus allow a precise determination of cosmological parameters . no evolution in the @xmath65 relation",
    "is expected ( using a correlation slope @xmath50 ) for @xmath6 if the current lcdm model is correct .",
