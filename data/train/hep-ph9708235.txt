    "recently , a model for the description of hadronic states has been developed and applied to both meson and baryon spectra @xcite .",
    "the success of the model in describing the spectra in these sectors has led to attempts to take the model further by applying it to multiquark states @xcite .",
    "this success has also led to the question of whether the model describes other aspects of baryon and meson spectroscopy adequately . in particular",
    ", it is useful to know whether the model can help shed light on some of the many outstanding puzzles in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "before such a question can be addressed , the model should be able to reproduce those portions of hadron phenomenology that are better understood . in this article",
    ", we present the results of application of the wave functions obtained from this model to the strong decays of light mesons .",
    "we find that the model is as successful as other models , for the decays examined .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the salient points of the hadronic model , as well as the model we use to describe the decays of hadrons . in section 3",
    "we present our results with some discussion , while our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "two ingredients are essential for a good description of meson decays . one of these is a realistic description of the mesons themselves .",
    "the second is a valid description of the transition operator .",
    "both of these depend very much on our educated guesses about non - perturbative qcd dynamics . in the case of the former ,",
    "there are many models proposed .",
    "we confine ourselves to the work of @xcite . for",
    "the meson decays , there are also a number of models proposed , but we will limit ourselves to the pair creation model first proposed by micu @xcite , and popularized by the orsay group @xcite .",
    "one possibility for the analysis of the meson spectrum is the use of a ` good ' quark - antiquark potential .",
    "this is the course we pursue .",
    "although the one - gluon exchange mechanism suggests possible functional forms for some terms of the potential , the fact that we still do not know much about the mechanism of confinement means that we must rely on phenomenology to determine both the form and the parameters of the potential .",
    "several potentials have been proposed in the past in the literature .",
    "we believe that in models of the kind that we propose , a very crucial test is a unified description of the meson and baryon spectra .",
    "this has been undertaken by one of us @xcite , and six different potentials have been found which fulfill this criterion .",
    "these potentials have been applied , not only to the meson and baryon sectors , but also to tetra - quark states @xcite , as well as to a description of the @xmath2 interaction @xcite .",
    "the results in all of these cases have been encouraging .    in this paper",
    ", we select two of these potentials for this study .",
    "the general form of each potential has been more or less imposed by some basic qcd constraints , but the parameters have been determined by a fit to a well - chosen sample of meson and baryon states . both potentials are used with a non - relativistic kinetic energy term , and they take the general form @xmath3    one peculiarity of these potentials is that the range @xmath4 of the hyperfine term is mass dependent through the relation @xmath5 in the limit of a vanishing range , this term gives the usual fermi - breit prescription @xmath6 .",
    "these potentials contain neither spin - orbit nor tensor contributions so that @xmath7 states have the same wave functions . in the same spirit , @xmath8 and @xmath9 mixings",
    "are absent .",
    "this approximation can have some effect on the results , but we are mainly interested in the gross features of the decays , so that the potentials are quite satisfactory from this point of view . furthermore , there is no isospin dependence ( this is a property shared by most potential models : in @xcite , isospin dependence is introduced by means of mixing through annihilation ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as well as the @xmath12 and @xmath13 resonances are degenerate , both in energy and in wave function .",
    "more dramatic is the case of the pseudoscalar mesons , as this leads to a degeneracy of the @xmath14 and the non - strange part of the @xmath15 .",
    "isospin dependence appears only through the flavor part of the wave function , although there probably should be a difference in the spatial part of the wave function as well . in any case",
    ", we consider two potentials that yield good overall results for the meson spectrum .",
    "the first potential , denoted al1 , has the usual coulomb+linear form for the central part , and its parameters are @xmath16    the second choice of potential , denoted ap1 , has a confining term suggested by the regge trajectory behavior of orbital states in a non - relativistic treatment .",
    "the parameters are @xmath17    both potentials reproduce spectra of comparable quality and are simple enough to be handled without any difficulty . in particular",
    ", it is quite easy to solve the differential equation resulting from the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , the radial part @xmath18 of the meson wave function is calculated numerically on a grid .",
    "such a form is not easily used for studying more complicated problems : a continuous expression is usually more convenient .",
    ".masses of some mesons used in the paper obtained with potential al1 .",
    "the experimental values are given in the second column ; for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 resonances we show the energy centroid .",
    "the third column reports the exact values obtained from the schrdinger equation by solving the resulting differential equation .",
    "the last three columns deal with the approximation based on gaussian functions with , respectively , @xmath19 terms in the expansion.[table0 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the kaon sector , our predictions are again in reasonable agreement with experiment . in the case of the @xmath20 s , we can not really compare theory and experiment , since we have not included mixing .",
    "this can easily be taken into account in the decays to the narrow states , but not for the broad states , since an integral over the partial _ width _ is required to evaluate the amplitude .",
    "thus , simply constructing a linear combination of the reported amplitudes will be ignoring potentially large interference effects .",
    "the place where our model ` fails ' most noticeably is in describing the decays of the @xmath21 .",
    "there , our amplitudes are consistently smaller than the experimental ones .",
    "note , however , that for the three measured amplitudes , our results agree ` qualitatively ' with the experiments , in that the 3 amplitudes are all predicted to be of roughly the same size .",
    "one other aspect of our results requires some comment .",
    "our results have been largely independent of the size of the expansion basis used , as well as of the choice of potential used to generate the wave functions .",
    "this may be understood by examining what part of the wave function provides the dominant contribution to any one of the amplitudes .",
    "it is apparent that these decays are neither fully ` long - distance ' nor ` short - distance ' processes , but more like ` intermediate - distance ' ( 1 - 5 gev@xmath22 ) processes . changes in the basis size have their main effect on the shape of the wave function in the region of the origin , as well as on the long distance tail . by changing the potential from al1 to ap1",
    ", we change the same regions of the wave function .",
    "we have examined the predictions of a quark model for the strong decays of several mesons .",
    "while this study was not exhaustive , it has been enough to show that the model enjoys some success , but that some improvements may be possible .",
    "the main improvements that can be made exist at the level of the meson wave functions .    at present",
    ", there is no spin - orbit term in either of the potentials used , nor is there a tensor interaction .",
    "both of these will lead to modifications of the wave functions that will , in turn , lead to changes in the strong decay amplitudes predicted by the model .",
    "these terms will also induce various mixings among the states , which will also modify the wave functions .",
    "such a study is underway , and the use of the modified wave functions in a strong decay analysis is left as a possible future endeavor .",
    "it would certainly be of interest to apply such wave functions to a more exhaustive examination of the strong decays of mesons , as there are several puzzles outstanding in the meson sector , particularly for mesons with masses between 1.0 and 2.0 gev . to date ,",
    "models of this kind have been our main source of insight into the meson spectrum . barring a radical revolution in the near future",
    ", they will remain so , at least for some time to come .",
