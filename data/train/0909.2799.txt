    "one of the simplest extensions of the standard model that can explain the dark matter is the addition of a real scalar singlet and an unbroken @xmath7 symmetry under which the singlet is odd while all other fields are even .",
    "such a model , known as the singlet scalar model of dark matter , has been studied several times in the literature @xcite .",
    "predictivity is undoubtedly its most salient feature .",
    "in contrast with other common scenarios that explain the dark matter , the singlet model contains only one additional field , the singlet scalar , and two new parameters : the singlet mass and the coupling between the singlet and the higgs boson the only standard model field that couples to it .",
    "the singlet relic density as well as its direct and indirect detections rates depend additionally on the higgs mass , which however can not vary in a wide range . after imposing the dark matter constraint ,",
    "the viable parameter space gets reduced simply to the singlet mass and the higgs mass .",
    "the implications of the model can then be studied as a function of the singlet mass for a few representative values of the higgs mass .",
    "the singlet scalar model , therefore , provides a compelling and predictive scenario to explain the dark matter .",
    "recently , it was shown @xcite that the singlet may have the right relic density to explain the observed dark matter abundance , that its direct detection cross section is large enough to be probed by present and planned experiments , and that the gamma rays from the annihilation of singlet scalar dark matter will likely be observed by the fermi satellite @xcite . to complete the analysis of this model , in this paper we study the indirect detection of singlet scalar dark matter through positrons and antiprotons .",
    "the indirect detection of dark matter is one of the promising avenues towards its identification . among them , antimatter searches in cosmic rays play an essential role .",
    "present experiments such as pamela @xcite and fermi @xcite are already measuring the cosmic ray spectrum with unprecedented precision .",
    "in fact they have already challenged our knowledge of the positron spectrum .",
    "future experiments such as ams-02 @xcite , which is scheduled to be launched next year , will measure the antiproton and the positron spectrum in a wider energy range and with significantly better statistics .",
    "hence , the chances of observing an exotic component from dark matter annihilation in the positron or the antiproton spectrum are now higher than ever .",
    "it is therefore crucial to study the expected antiproton and positron fluxes in well - motivated scenarios for physics beyond the standard model that account for the dark matter of the universe .",
    "the antiproton and positron fluxes from singlet annihilation not only depend on the dark matter model but also on a number of astrophysical factors that affect the production and propagation of such particles throughout the galaxy . to take these effects into account , we consider different propagation models for positrons and antiprotons , and we study the possible role of substructures in the dark matter halo .",
    "our goals are to find out whether any region of the parameter space is already ruled out by present data from pamela , and to identify those regions that are within the sensitivity of the ams-02 experiment .",
    "in addition , by comparing the corresponding regions for positrons and antiprotons , we expect to determine which of these two signals offers better perspectives to probe the singlet scalar model .    in the next section",
    "the main features of the singlet scalar model of dark matter will be briefly reviewed .",
    "then , in section [ sec : antip ] , we present a detailed analysis of the antiproton signal in this model . in particular , we determine the excluded and detectable regions in the plane ( @xmath8 for different sets of parameters accounting for propagation and substructure effects . in section [ sec : positrons ] we present an analogous analysis for the positron channel . a brief discussion of our main results is given in section [ sec : disc ] , which is followed by our conclusions .",
    "the lagrangian that describes the singlet scalar model of dark matter is @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the standard model lagrangian , @xmath11 is the higgs doublet , and @xmath12 is the singlet scalar field .",
    "this is the most general renormalizable lagrangian that is compatible with the @xmath13 gauge invariance and with the symmetry @xmath14 .",
    "notice , from the lagrangian , that the higgs boson is the only standard model field that directly couples to the singlet .",
    "this extension of the standard model contains , therefore , two new phenomenologically relevant parameters : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . instead of @xmath15 ,",
    "it is useful to consider the physical mass of the singlet @xmath17 as a free parameter of the model .",
    "the other free parameter is @xmath16 , which determines the trilinear ( @xmath18 ) and quartic ( @xmath19 ) coupling between the singlet and the physical higgs boson .",
    "in addition to @xmath20 and @xmath16 , the dependence on the higgs mass a sm parameter should also be also taken into account , as it affects the dark matter phenomenology . to accurately compute the singlet relic density we use the micromegas package @xcite , which can calculate the relic density in a generic dark matter model .",
    "singlets can annihilate through s - channel higgs boson exchange into a variety of final states : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "additionally , they can also annihilate into @xmath24 either directly or through singlet exchange . depending on the singlet mass",
    ", two annihilation regions can be clearly distinguished .",
    "a light singlet , @xmath25 , will annihilate mainly into the @xmath26 final state , with subdominant contributions from other light fermions . to obtain the correct relic density ,",
    "such light singlets require a relatively large value of @xmath16 ( @xmath27 ) , and are consequently constrained by direct detection experiments .",
    "singlets masses below @xmath28 , for instance , are already ruled out by current measurements @xcite .",
    "a heavy singlet , @xmath29 , on the other hand , will annihilate mainly into @xmath22 , with additional contributions from @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath30 . in this region",
    "the required value of @xmath16 is typically smaller ( @xmath31 ) and present direct detection constrains are ineffective .",
    "figure [ fig : brs ] displays the annihilation branching fractions as a function of the singlet mass for @xmath32 .",
    "the sharp contrast between the light singlet region and the heavy one is clearly observed .     while the value of @xmath16 was obtained by imposing the dark matter constraint .",
    "[ fig : brs ] ]    being a scalar field , the singlet annihilation rate today is not suppressed with respect to that of the early universe ( s - wave annihilation ) . moreover , throughout most of the viable parameter space @xmath33 is constant and equal to the typical annihilation rate , @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the only two places where @xmath33 is smaller are at the @xmath35 threshold ( @xmath36 ) and at the higgs resonance ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "in fact , the main effect of the higgs mass is to determine the position where this resonance lies . in the following analysis",
    "we will set @xmath38 to @xmath39 and consider only the remaining dependence on the singlet mass .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , singlet masses below @xmath40 will be considered .",
    "antiprotons can be produced either by dark matter annihilations or through different kinds of astrophysical mechanisms . after being produced they propagate in the galaxy and reach the earth , where they can be detected as exotic components in cosmic rays .",
    "the pamela experiment reported recently @xcite the measurement of the antiproton to proton flux ratio up to @xmath41 , which is in agreement with that predicted by the conventional background model . in the near future , the ams-02 experiment , to be launched next year , will measure the antiproton flux with even higher precision , increasing the odds of finding an additional component due to dark matter annihilations .",
    "once produced , antiprotons propagate throughout the galaxy undergoing several processes :    * they scatter on irregularities of the galactic magnetic field alfvn waves .",
    "these scatterings constitute , in fact , a space diffusion process with a diffusion coefficient given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the antiproton kinetic energy , @xmath44 is the antiproton momentum , and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are free parameters of the propagation model that are constrained by a combination of theoretical predictions and astrophysical data . *",
    "they undergo a second order fermi mechanism reacceleration , due to the motion of the scattering centers with a velocity of @xmath48 km / sec .",
    "this reacceleration process is described by the coefficient @xmath49 * they lose energy either adiabatically , or through coulomb scattering , or by ionizing the interstellar ( is ) medium .",
    "the total energy loss rate is denoted by @xmath50 and depends on the antiproton energy . *",
    "they are wiped away from the galactic disk through convection , with a velocity @xmath51 km / sec . in the following",
    ", this velocity will be taken to be completely vertical to the disk : @xmath52 .",
    "* they can annihilate upon scattering on the is medium . in this study",
    ", we shall consider the two primary components of the medium , namely hydrogen and helium .",
    "the annihilation cross - sections for @xmath53 and @xmath54 scattering have been taken from @xcite , where the well - known tan&ng parametrization @xcite is used .    the propagation of antiprotons in the interstellar medium , taking into account all of the above processes , is described by a diffusion - convection equation of the form @xmath55 = q\\ , , \\label{masterprop}\\ ] ] where we denote by @xmath56 the energy density of the antiprotons , and by @xmath57 the source term see equation ( [ eq : q ] )",
    "actually , this equation is rather generic and can be applied to other particles species propagating in the galaxy .",
    "only the values of the different parameters , but not the equation itself , will vary depending on the propagating particle .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : positrons ] , for instance , that this same equation describes the propagation of positrons in the interstellar medium .",
    "let us now see how to solve this equation for antiprotons .      to solve equation ( [ masterprop ] ) , we shall use the method proposed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the idea of this method is to adopt a simpler version of equation ( [ masterprop ] ) for which the green function can be calculated analytically . to achieve such simplification , certain processes contributing to the final antiproton spectrum have to be neglected",
    "specifically , all energy redistributions in the initial ( injection ) spectrum energy losses , reacceleration , as well as `` tertiary '' contributions ( i.e. contributions from secondary antiprotons produced upon inelastic scattering with the is medium) are ignored . whether these redistributions are important or not depends mainly on the antiproton energy .",
    "for gev energies , the results may deviate up to @xmath58 from those obtained with the ( more complete ) bessel function treatment in @xcite a comparison between the two methods can be found ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "but for energies around @xmath59 gev , the accuracy of the method improves dramatically , yielding essentially indistinguishable results at slightly higher energies .",
    "since the @xmath60 energy region we shall consider begins at @xmath61 gev , we can safely use this simplified approach . apart from its clearer physical interpretation ,",
    "the main advantage of this method is that astrophysical effects can be separated from particle physics ones . as a result , it is a well - suited method for scans in parameter spaces , as those we are going to carry out in the following .",
    "if we denote by @xmath62 the destruction rate of antiprotons in the ism , where @xmath63 , and implementing the aforementioned simplifications , the transport equation for a point source ( which actually defines the propagator @xmath64 ) is : @xmath65 g =   \\delta(\\vec{r } - \\vec{r}')\\,.\\ ] ] the antiproton propagator can then be written as @xmath66 where @xmath46 is a modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath67 with @xmath68 pc being the half thickness of the galactic disc , and @xmath69 being the half - thickness of the diffusive zone .",
    "@xmath70 is obtained as the solution of the equation @xmath71 then , in order to compute the flux expected on earth , we should convolute the green function ( [ greenpbars ] ) with the source distribution @xmath72 . for dark matter annihilations in the galactic halo ,",
    "the source term is given by @xmath73 where the index @xmath74 runs over all possible annihilation final states .",
    "the decay of sm particles into antiprotons can be calculated with programs like pythia @xcite . in the singlet scalar model of dark matter",
    ", antiprotons may originate in @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 decays .",
    "regarding the distribution of dark matter in the galaxy , @xmath79 , we assume a nfw profile with a local density of @xmath80 .",
    "the final expression for the antiproton flux on the earth takes the form @xmath81 where none of the integrated quantities depends on the antiproton energy .",
    "this feature demonstrates one of the virtues of the green function method applied to antiprotons : the integral in equation ( [ pbarflux ] ) , which we compute using a vegas monte - carlo algorithm , needs to be calculated only once for each value of the injection energy , for it is the same as the detection energy .    regarding the propagation parameters @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , we take their values from the well - established min , max and med models see table [ propparameters ] .",
    "the former two models correspond to the minimal and maximal antiprotons fluxes that are compatible with the b / c data . the med model , on the other hand , correspond to the parameters that best fit the b / c data .",
    ".values of propagation parameters widely used in the literature and providing minimal and maximal antiproton fluxes , or consitute the best fit to the b / c data . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as in the case of antiprotons , a crucial factor in the treatment of positron propagation is the adopted propagation model . in this case",
    "there are mainly 3 relevant parameters , namely @xmath69 , @xmath46 and @xmath84 ; that is , the half - thickness of the cylindrical diffusive zone , the diffusion constant and the spectral index , respectively . for their values",
    "we use the three models described in table [ propparameterspos ] .",
    "the resulting positron flux from dm annihilations can be written as ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath85 where the detection and the production energy are denoted respectively by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 is the production spectrum for positrons , @xmath89 , with @xmath74 running over all possible annihilation channels .",
    "the diffusion length , @xmath90 , is defined by @xmath91 the so - called halo function , @xmath92 , contains all the dependence on astrophysical factors .",
    "it is given as @xmath93 the modified green function @xmath94 is in its turn defined by @xmath95 with @xmath96 depending on the value of the characteristic parameter @xmath97 .",
    "when @xmath98 when the diffusion time is small boundary conditions can be ignored and the propagation equation can be treated as a @xmath99-@xmath100 schroedinger equation . in that case",
    "@xmath101 when @xmath102 is small this approximation no longer holds but we can express @xmath96 as @xmath103\\ ] ] where @xmath104    we now have all the necessary ingredients for the computation of the expected positron flux from singlet scalar dark matter annihilation .",
    "next we discuss the positron background .      in the conventional background model ,",
    "positrons are produced in the interactions between cosmic - ray nuclei and the interstellar medium .",
    "the expected positron flux on earth can be written as @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath86 is given in gev .",
    "in contrast to the antiproton case , this conventional background is not compatible with the recent data from pamela @xcite and fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "even after taking into account the possible uncertainties due to cosmic ray propagation , the data reveals a clear excess over this background at high energies , @xmath106 gev .",
    "hence , a new source of high energy positrons is necessary to explain the data .",
    "two main interpretations of this positron excess have been considered in the literature .",
    "one is the annihilation of dark matter particles .",
    "though viable , such models are rather contrived .",
    "they require multi - tev masses , annihilation into leptonic final states , and an annihilation rate several orders of magnitude larger than that expected for a thermal relic @xcite",
    ". moreover , they are tightly constrained by experimental data gamma rays , radio emission , cmb , bbn @xcite .",
    "given that , in addition , the singlet model can not explain the positron excess ( at least in the energy region we examine and for reasonable astrophysical assumptions ) , we will not consider this dark matter interpretation any further .",
    "the other main interpretation for the observed positron excess is that it is generated by astrophysical sources , such as pulsars @xcite .",
    "if that is the case , such astrophysical positrons constitute an additional background to the positrons from dark matter annihilation .",
    "and they must be taken into account when studying the sensitivity of future experiments to a dark matter positron signal , as pointed out in @xcite . here",
    ", we will closely follow their approach .",
    "that is , we use as background the positron flux obtained from the pulsar interpretation of pamela and fermi - lat data @xcite  see figure 2 in @xcite .",
    "that background is compatible with the absolute positron flux derived in @xcite .",
    "for positrons we follow a procedure analogous to that for antiprotons .",
    "we first find the regions that are already excluded by present data and then determine those that will be detectable in ams-02 . when using equation ( [ chi2 ] ) , it must be taken into account that the geometrical acceptance of ams-02 for positrons is @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : pospamela ] displays the regions that are already excluded for the min , med , and max propagation models .",
    "the solid ( black ) line shows , instead , the prediction of the singlet scalar model . notice that the variation due to the propagation model is very small , certainly much smaller than for antiprotons . from the figure",
    "we also see that the exclusion lines all lie well above the model s prediction .",
    "we checked that a similar result is found even in the optimistic scenario for substructure enhancement . at present , henceforth , no region of the viable parameter space is even close to being excluded via the positron signal .",
    "the ams-02 detectable regions are shown in figure [ fig : posams ] for the three propagation models . again",
    ", not much difference is observed between the min , med and max lines .",
    "moreover , only a small region around @xmath108 gev is within the ams-02 reach .",
    "thus , without additional boost factors , singlet masses above @xmath109 gev do not produce a detectable positron signal at ams-02 .",
    "once the effect of dark matter substructures is included , the detectable region extends to higher singlet masses , as illustrated in figure [ fig : clumpsposams ] . for the optimistic scenario , @xmath110 ,",
    "the whole mass range becomes detectable independently of the propagation model .",
    "for the moderate scenario , @xmath111 , the ams-02 reach extends to singlet masses of @xmath112 gev and @xmath109 gev for the min and max models respectively .",
    "thus , a substructure enhancement is required to probe the singlet model beyond @xmath108 gev at ams-02 .",
    "our results clearly indicate that in the singlet scalar model the indirect detection of dark matter via antimatter is feasible , particularly through the antiproton channel .",
    "the positron channel also gives rise to an observable signal at ams-02 , but only for light singlets .",
    "the antiproton signal , on the other hand , should be visible over most of the viable parameter space .    to identify the singlet scalar model as the correct model of dark matter , one would need to measure @xmath38 and @xmath20 , the only two parameters of the model , and to confirm some of the model predictions .",
    "such a task would certainly require input from different experiments : accelerator searches , direct detection experiments , and indirect searches through several channels .",
    "searches at the lhc , for instance , could provide a measurement of the higgs mass , but they are not expected to say much about the singlet mass .",
    "it is mainly through direct and indirect detection searches that the singlet mass could be determined .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the singlet direct detection rate is within the reach of current and future experiments and that the gamma ray signal from singlet dark matter annihilation is likely to be observed by the fermi satellite . in this paper",
    ", we have found that also the antiproton signal is observable at ams-02 . by combining the signals from these three experiments the singlet mass , @xmath20 ,",
    "might be determined .",
    "once @xmath38 and @xmath20 are known , the singlet model of dark matter is completely specified , at least within the standard cosmological scenario .",
    "the singlet scalar model provides a simple and predictive scenario to account for the dark matter . in this paper",
    ", we studied in detail the antiproton and positron signals expected from the annihilation of singlet scalar dark matter .",
    "particular attention was paid to the role of the propagation model and to a possible enhancement in the annihilation rate due to dark matter substructures in the galaxy .",
    "we used the recent measurements , from pamela and fermi - lat , of the positron and antiproton flux to find the regions in the plane ( @xmath113 ) that are already excluded by the data . for antiprotons , an optimistic enhancement , @xmath110 , due to dark matter clumps",
    "is essentially excluded for both the med and the max propagation models in the entire mass range we considered . for positrons , on the contrary , no region",
    "is excluded independently of the propagation model or the possible effect of substructures .",
    "we also analyzed the perspectives for detecting antimatter signals in future experiments . in ams-02 , the positron signal , in the absence of additional boosts , was found to be detectable but only for light singlets .",
    "antiprotons , on the other hand , offer excellent perspectives to be detected at ams-02 . even without boosts ,",
    "the whole mass range is within the sensitivity of ams-02 for the med and the max propagation models . for the min model ,",
    "a moderate enhancement from substructures , @xmath111 , would allow to probe the mass range below @xmath114 .",
    "antiprotons , therefore , seem to be a promising way to constrain or detect the singlet scalar model of dark matter .",
