    "[ fig : btorhovsbtopi ] we show the differential decay rates @xmath4 for @xmath0 and @xmath130 .",
    "for @xmath0 we assume that @xmath66 , @xmath135 and @xmath29 are all given by single pole forms with a common pole mass of @xmath172 and a normalisation determined by our measurements for the @xmath91 momentum channel .",
    "for @xmath130 we use the results of reference  @xcite with a dipole form for the form factor @xmath173 with @xmath174 and a mass parameter @xmath175 .",
    "these curves are meant to be illustrative , based on reasonable hypotheses : for @xmath130 the results in  @xcite were obtained for unphysically large @xmath176 and @xmath53 quark masses ; for @xmath0 we do not necessarily believe that the three form factors involved are all simultaneously single pole types with the same pole mass ( the pole mass of @xmath172 is an estimate of the average of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath144 resonance masses ) .",
    "the points we wish to make are :    1 .   for @xmath0 the events near @xmath40",
    "have already been recommended for study , but the expected number of events at large @xmath46 is at least comparable .",
    "2 .   in the region beyond the charm threshold ,",
    "the rates for @xmath0 and @xmath130 are at least comparable ( @xmath130 is not ten times more common than @xmath0 , for example ) , so both should be sizable contributions to the inclusive @xmath10 event rate and either or both can be used for the determination of @xmath5 .    to    the lattice calculations of the form factors in the previous section provide data points for @xmath4 over a sizable fraction of the region in @xmath46 above the charm endpoint ,",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : btorhovsbtopi ] . the uncertainties in determining @xmath135 and @xmath29 in the @xmath113 and @xmath117 momentum channels",
    "do not prejudice our measurement of the differential decay rate .",
    "the rate is forced to vanish for kinematical reasons at @xmath56 so the @xmath113 channel form factor values of @xmath135 and @xmath29 are irrelevant .",
    "moreover , the contribution to the differential decay rate of these two form factors in the @xmath117 channel is highly suppressed ( the @xmath117 channel has a @xmath46 near @xmath56 and the @xmath135 and @xmath29 contributions are suppressed relative to that of @xmath66 by a factor @xmath177 as shown in equation  ( [ eq : diffdecayrate ] ) ) . over the range of @xmath46 for which we have measurements , the differential decay rate is dominated by the form factor @xmath66 .",
    "this is shown by the difference between the points marked by squares and crosses in figure  [ fig : btorhovsbtopi ] .    in table",
    "[ tab : diffdecaypoints ] we give the numerical values we have obtained for the differential decay rate at several @xmath46 values .",
    "we have parametrised the results of the table by fitting our measured points for @xmath4 to the form @xmath178^{\\frac{1}{2 } } a^2 \\big ( 1 + b(q^2-\\qsqmax ) \\big),\\ ] ] obtained by retaining the phase space dependence and expanding @xmath179 and @xmath167 from equation  ( [ eq : diffdecayrate ] ) around @xmath56 .",
    "the results of the fit are @xmath180 where the quoted errors are statistical .",
    "a 24% systematic error should be added as discussed below .    with this parametrisation",
    ", we can partially integrate the differential decay rate , giving the results shown in the last column of table  [ tab : diffdecaypoints ] .",
    "the table also includes the partially integrated decay rate from the charm threshold to @xmath56 , although higher order terms in the taylor expansion in equation  ( [ eq : param ] ) could become sizable at the lower end of this range , where we do not currently have measured points .",
    "the results of table  [ tab : diffdecaypoints ] and equation  ( [ eq : abvalues ] ) have been obtained by extrapolating the form factors linearly in @xmath64 .",
    "quadratic extrapolations in @xmath64 give results differing in the last significant figure , which is always well within the statistical errors . in figure  [ fig : vub ] we show our measured data together with the fit , including 68% confidence level bounds .",
    "to    to    comparison of any of the values in table  [ tab : diffdecaypoints ] with experimental measurements will allow an extraction of @xmath5 with less than 10% statistical and 12% systematic theoretical uncertainties .",
    "another way to determine @xmath5 uses the parametrisation of equation  ( [ eq : param ] ) and our results of equation  ( [ eq : abvalues ] ) .",
    "it parallels the method used to extract @xmath13 from semileptonic @xmath181 decays ( see references  @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the factor @xmath182 in equation  ( [ eq : param ] ) parametrises long distance hadronic dynamics ( it is the analogue of the function @xmath183 in  @xcite for the @xmath184 case ) .",
    "the idea is to use experimental measurements of @xmath4 extrapolated to @xmath56 to extract a value for @xmath185 and compare with our theoretical determination of @xmath186 . here",
    "@xmath78 plays the role of @xmath187 in the @xmath181 extraction of @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice simulation provides a systematic determination of the overall normalisation of hadronic dynamical effects , parametrised by @xmath78 . for the extraction of @xmath13 from @xmath181",
    "decays hqs provides such a normalisation ( the isgur - wise function is @xmath58 at zero recoil , up to @xmath128 and short distance perturbative corrections ) . for the heavy - to - light @xmath0 semileptonic decay , such a normalisation",
    "is not provided by hqs .    in the fit to equation  ( [ eq : param ] )",
    "the @xmath113 channel is not used because @xmath188 is zero and our fitting function automatically incorporates this feature .",
    "our value for @xmath189 from the @xmath113 channel therefore gives an independent measurement of @xmath186 because @xmath29 and @xmath135 do not contribute at this kinematic point .",
    "we find , using the value from table  [ tab : formfactorvalues ] , and quoting statistical errors only , @xmath190 in excellent agreement with @xmath186 determined by the fit to the other channels .",
    "this suggests that discretisation and other systematic errors have not conspired to change drastically the shape of the overall @xmath46 dependence .",
    "our final result will use the value of @xmath186 , given in equation  ( [ eq : abvalues ] ) , determined from the fit to these other channels , because this does not rely on a single measurement .    to estimate systematic uncertainties , we have considered four possible sources of errors : quenching , determination of the lattice spacing in physical units , light spectator mass independence of the form factors and discretisation errors .",
    "the exact effect of ignoring internal quark loops is an unknown systematic error .",
    "however , quenched lattice calculations of form factors for @xmath191 semileptonic decays ( see  @xcite and references therein ) give results in agreement with world average experimental values , while quenched calculations of @xmath192  @xcite decays have allowed extractions of @xmath13 in agreement with other determinations of that quantity .",
    "this gives us some confidence that errors due to quenching are most likely within the statistical errors for processes involving a heavy quark .",
    "the error arising from uncertainties in the value of the lattice spacing in physical units should be minimised in our calculation , because we have evaluated only dimensionless quantities : form factors and values of the velocity transfer , @xmath193 .",
    "physical meson masses have been used as input where dimensional results are required . the only dependence on the lattice scale enters in expressing the heavy - light pseudoscalar masses in physical units for the @xmath64 extrapolations of the form factors and in the short distance logarithmic corrections of equation  ( [ eq : theta ] ) .",
    "the systematic error induced is much smaller than the other errors we will consider below .",
    "we believe our results show good evidence for light spectator mass independence of the form factors .",
    "we made this independence an assumption in order to use the results for the heaviest light spectator quark only : these results have smaller statistical error and are available for all our heavy quarks .",
    "in the previous section we argued that we could not rule out a 5% error in @xmath66 ( 10% in channels involving @xmath89 momenta for the light meson ) due to this assumption .",
    "the corresponding errors in @xmath135 and @xmath29 were 20% and 10% respectively . in the region",
    "near @xmath56 , @xmath4 is dominated by @xmath66 and the contributions of @xmath29 and @xmath135 are kinematically suppressed , being 5% or less for @xmath194 .",
    "the @xmath116 and @xmath195 channels explore lower @xmath46 values where the @xmath29 and @xmath135 contributions are less suppressed , of order 1520% ( see figure  [ fig : btorhovsbtopi ] ) .",
    "if the spectator quark mass independence assumption were violated by as much as 20% for @xmath29 and @xmath135 , the error in the differential decay rate would only be of the order of 2% for the non-@xmath89 channels , and 68% for the @xmath89 channels noted above , smaller in both cases than the likely 10% error induced by the same assumption for @xmath66 ( the differential decay rate is proportional to the square of the form factors ) ) of having a 10% error in the @xmath89 light meson momentum channels .",
    "this changes the parameter  @xmath78 by 5% . ] .",
    "systematic errors due to this approximation are within our statistical errors .",
    "a conservative estimate of the systematic error in the differential decay rate arising from this source can be obtained by adding in quadrature the 10% error due to @xmath66 and the worst - case 8% error from @xmath29 and @xmath135 , to get a final error of 13% .",
    "we will see below that discretisation errors are expected to be almost twice as large as this .",
    "we discussed in section  [ sec : latticedetails ] that we could not dismiss having 10% errors in the form factors arising from discretisation errors at the value of @xmath85 used . in consequence",
    ", we will admit a 20% error in the decay rate which translates into a 10% error in @xmath5 .",
    "these errors are the largest among the systematic effects considered , and they almost entirely determine our overall systematic error . combining errors from discretisation and our assumption of light quark spectator mass independence of the form factors in quadrature , we finally obtain an estimated 24% systematic error in the decay rate , which should be added to the results of table  [ tab : diffdecaypoints ] and equations  ( [ eq : param])([eq : a2from00 ] ) .",
    "we have presented a method for extracting the ckm matrix element @xmath5 from experimental measurements of the exclusive decay @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown how lattice simulations provide a model - independent framework in which nonperturbative qcd corrections can be systematically incorporated in the evaluation of the differential decay rate @xmath196 in a region of @xmath46 values from the charm threshold up to the zero recoil point , @xmath56 .",
    "we have measured points spanning roughly two - thirds of this region of @xmath46 .",
    "one of the main features of the approach presented here is that it does not rely upon large , difficult and model - dependent extrapolations in @xmath46 from @xmath56 down to values close to @xmath197 , where the semileptonic decays are dominated by charmed final states , as in other previously suggested methods .",
    "discounting experimental errors , the results of table  [ tab : diffdecaypoints ] will allow the determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath5 with a theoretical uncertainty of less than 10% statistical and 12% systematic .",
    "alternatively , determinations of @xmath5 ( with similar theoretical ambiguities ) can be obtained from the overall normalisation of the hadronic effects parametrised by @xmath78 , found to be @xmath198 both statistical and systematic theoretical errors will be reduced in forthcoming lattice simulations with smaller lattice spacing ( to reduce discretisation errors , currently the principal systematic effect ) and higher statistics .    currently , only an upper bound for the total decay rate @xmath199 is known experimentally , but new results are forthcoming .",
    "it is important that the differential decay rate near @xmath56 be measured , since , as we have shown , such a measurement can provide a clean determination of @xmath5 in the same way that similar measurements for the @xmath200 semileptonic decay have successfully been used to extract an accurate value for @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    "we have also determined the @xmath46 dependence of the form factor @xmath66 ( which dominates the decay rate close to the zero recoil point ) for the @xmath0 decay in the region from @xmath40 to @xmath56 .",
    "the form factors @xmath29 and @xmath135 , for the same semileptonic decay , have been studied in a region of @xmath46 around @xmath56 .",
    "finally , relations between radiative and semileptonic @xmath6 decays into light vector mesons , predicted by hqs , have been examined and found to hold within errors for the ratio @xmath119 and within 20% for the ratio @xmath118 at the @xmath11 scale .",
    "using extra momentum channels where the heavy - light meson is not at rest , but @xmath57 is nevertheless nearly constant as the heavy quark mass changes  @xcite , has been essential for studying @xmath46 , or equivalently @xmath57 , dependences of @xmath66 , @xmath119 , @xmath118 and @xmath4 .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath46 dependence of @xmath4 has allowed us to determine the parameter @xmath78 from a set of five measurements as well as from the zero recoil channel , giving us further confidence in our procedure for extracting @xmath5 .",
