    "shaped post - laser - field electronic oscillations were also found to exist in h@xmath0 excited by two - cycle laser pulses at the wavelengths @xmath18 and 200  nm .",

    "note before proceeding , that at a small number of optical cycles per pulse duration , as in the present work for example , the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) may play a very important role @xcite .",
    "we shall address this issue in our future work .",
    "here , we just assume that the carrier - envelope phase is equal to zero , see equation  ( [ lfield ] ) .",
    "the numerical methods used to solve the three - dimensional equation  ( [ tdse1 ] ) have been described in our previous works @xcite . in particular , the dissociation probability has been calculated with the time- and space - integrated outgoing flux for the nuclear coordinate @xmath1 ; the ionization probabilities have been calculated with the respective fluxes separately for the positive and the negative direction of the @xmath2 axis as well as for the outer end of the @xmath53 axis .",
    "the size of the @xmath2-grid has been chosen such as to be substantially larger than the maximum electron excursion along the @xmath2 axis , @xmath54 , and the size of the @xmath3-grid has been chosen accordingly . the maximum electron excursion , @xmath55 au , corresponds to the field parameters used at @xmath5  nm ( @xmath56  au and @xmath57  au ) and the choice of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 grids has been based on this value .",
    "specifically , the three - dimensional wave - function @xmath58 of equation  ( [ tdse1 ] ) was damped with the imaginary smooth optical potentials , adapted from @xcite , at @xmath59  au , at @xmath60  au and at @xmath61  au for the electronic motion , and at @xmath62  au for the nuclear motion .    initially , at @xmath63 , the @xmath25",
    "was assumed to be in its ground vibrational and ground electronic state .",
    "the wave function of the initial state was been obtained by the numerical propagation of equation  ( [ tdse1 ] ) in the imaginary time without the laser field ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the amplitudes @xmath48 of the one - cycle laser pulses used in the present work have been chosen such that the energies of @xmath25 at the ends of the laser pulses were slightly below the dissociation threshold ( @xmath65  au ) and similar , @xmath66  au .",
    "the amplitudes of one - cycle laser pulses required to achieve the aforementioned energy are plotted in figure  2 versus their wavelength @xmath67 by curve  1 . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "similar results obtained with two - cycle laser pulses are presented in figure  2 by curve  2 .     from its ground vibrational state @xmath68 to the energy of @xmath69  au.,scaledwidth=57.0% ]",
    "two different domains of the laser wavelength @xmath67 can be clearly distinguished in figure  2 .",
    "the domain of a large change of the laser pulse amplitude @xmath48 required to excite @xmath25 to the energy of @xmath69  au with the laser wavelength @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath70  nm ( or @xmath22 ) .",
    "the domain of a relatively small change of @xmath48 with @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath71  nm ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is also seen from figure  2 that the most efficient excitation of @xmath25 by one - cycle and two - cycle laser pulses , which requires the minimum laser electric - field amplitude , takes place at @xmath72  nm , which plays the role of a resonant , or the optimal laser wavelength .",
    "it can be expected therefore that power spectra of electron oscillations resulting from excitation of @xmath25 to @xmath69  au at various laser wavelengths @xmath73  nm should always contain harmonics corresponding to @xmath74  nm .    indeed , it was shown in our recent work @xcite , where excitation of @xmath25 with two - cycle laser pulses at @xmath75 and 800  nm was studied , that the respective power spectra contain the strongest harmonics corresponding to @xmath76  nm , the fourth harmonic at @xmath77  nm and the first ( identical ) harmonic at @xmath75  nm .",
    "it will be interesting to check therefore whether the excitation of @xmath25 with laser wavelengths @xmath70  nm would result in the generation of lower - order harmonics .",
    "an important problem of the laser - driven dynamics with few - cycle laser pulses is the electron - field following . according to the well - known recollision model of corkum @xcite",
    ", electron follows the field out - of - phase : the expectation value @xmath78 decreases when electric - field strength @xmath34 increases .",
    "previously , a perfect electron - field out - of - phase following on the level of expectation values @xmath9 of the laser - driven electronic degree of freedom have been found only in the infrared @xcite and near - infrared @xcite domains of the laser carrier frequency , with a large number of optical cycles per pulse duration @xmath49 being involved .",
    "it was also found in our previous work @xcite that electrons of the extended h - h system follow the applied laser field out - of phase at the laser carrier frequency @xmath79  au , and in - phase at @xmath80  au , with the number of optical cycles per pulse duration being about 33 .",
    "the laser - driven dynamics of @xmath25 excited by two - cycle laser pulses was studied in our recent work @xcite .",
    "it was found , in particular , that at @xmath77  nm , the expectation value @xmath9 follows the field out - of - phase only approximately ( during the first optical cycle ) , while at @xmath75  nm , the out - of - phase electron - field following does not take place even approximately .",
    "it would be moreover difficult to expect the out - of - phase electron - field following for expectation values @xmath9 at one - cycle excitation .",
    "the laser - driven dynamics of @xmath25 excited by one - cycle laser pulses at @xmath81 and 300  nm is presented in figure  3 on the timescale of 3  fs ( left and right panel , respectively ) .",
    "it is seen from figures  3(a ) , 3(b ) , 3(d ) and 3(e ) that electron approximately follows the laser field out - of - phase only during the first half - cycle , while during the second half - cycle of the laser pulse , the expectation value @xmath9 may change even in - phase with the laser field . nevertheless , after the ends of one - cycle laser pulses , expectation values @xmath9 demonstrate rather regular oscillations with the period of @xmath82  fs corresponding to the wavelength @xmath8  nm and frequency @xmath83  au .",
    "the transversal electron degree of freedom , @xmath3 , is optically passive if the laser field is aligned along the @xmath2 axis ( figure  1 ) .",
    "it can be excited therefore only due to the wave properties of electron .",
    "the time - dependent expectation values @xmath11 at laser wavelengths @xmath81 and 300  nm are presented in figures  3(c ) and ( f ) , respectively .",
    "it is seen that expectation values @xmath11 start to increase at the end of the first optical half - cycle and demonstrates quite regular ( yet not harmonic ) oscillations during the second optical half - cycle and after the ends of the one - cycle laser pulses .",
    "two major frequencies of @xmath3-oscillations can be distinguished at a close look . indeed , time intervals between two highest maxima of @xmath3-oscillations in figures  3(c ) and ( f ) are @xmath84  fs ,",
    "corresponding to the frequency of @xmath13 , or the wavelength of @xmath85  nm . on the other hand , time intervals between the neighboring maxima of @xmath3-oscillations in figures  3(c ) and ( f ) , are @xmath86  fs , corresponding to the frequency of @xmath14 , or the wavelength of @xmath87  nm .",
    "while the appearance of electronic @xmath3-oscillations with the frequency @xmath13 being very close to the frequency of electronic @xmath2-oscillations could be expected , the `` frequency - doubling '' of electronic @xmath3-oscillations occurring at @xmath14 needs more explanations .",
    "such a frequency - doubling of electronic @xmath2-oscillations by its @xmath3-oscillations occurring at @xmath14 was explained in our previous works @xcite as follows . during electronic oscillations along the @xmath2 axis , the electronic density is substantially delocalized also in the transversal , @xmath3 direction , due to the wave properties of the electron .",
    "this takes place at every turning point of electronic @xmath2-oscillations , i.e. , twice per every cycle of electronic @xmath2-oscillations , giving rise to excitation of @xmath25 along the @xmath3 axis in a stepwise manner .",
    "similar frequency - doubling of muonic oscillation also takes place in muonic @xmath15 and @xmath16 molecules excited by super - intense soft x - ray laser pulses at the wavelength of @xmath17  nm on the attosecond timescale @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the post - laser - field electronic @xmath2-oscillations in @xmath25 excited by one - cycle laser pulses is their asymmetry with respect to @xmath88 [ figures  3(b ) and ( e ) ] .",
    "this is especially evident on a longer timescale in comparison with smoothly shaped oscillations of expectation values @xmath89 , as shown in figure  4 on the timescale of 12  fs .",
    "the left panel presents expectation values @xmath9 at the laser wavelength @xmath81  nm ( a ) and @xmath90  nm ( b ) .",
    "the right panel presents expectation values @xmath89 at @xmath81  nm ( c ) and @xmath90  nm ( d ) .",
    "post - field oscillations of @xmath89 occur with the same frequency , @xmath83  au ( corresponding to the wavelength @xmath8  nm ) as those of @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of coherent post - laser - field oscillations of @xmath9 and @xmath89 in @xmath25 excited to the energy of @xmath23  au by two - cycle laser pulses was rationalized in detail in our recent work @xcite where approximately the same characteristic oscillation frequency was calculated .",
    "thus in the present case of one - cycle laser pulses similar arguments hold true to explain the appearance of post - laser - field electronic oscillations .",
    "note that the characteristic oscillation frequency corresponding to @xmath91  nm is in line with the results presented in figure  2 evidencing the most efficient excitation of @xmath25 to @xmath23  au at the laser wavelength of @xmath92  nm .",
    "also note that asymmetry of time - dependent expectation values @xmath9 with respect to @xmath88 implies the time - dependent polarization of @xmath25 after its excitation by one - cycle laser pulses .",
    "numerical simulations of the laser - driven quantum dynamics and subsequent free evolution of @xmath25 were performed as long as ionization and dissociation probabilities were small enough , not more than about 2% .",
    "excited by one - cycle laser pulse at the wavelength @xmath4  nm . curve  1  ionization probability for the outer end of the @xmath53 axis ; curves  2 and 3  ionization probabilities for the negative and the positive direction of the @xmath2 axis , respectively ; curve  4  dissociation probability . parameters of the laser pulse : @xmath93  au , @xmath94  au , @xmath95  fs.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    the time - dependent ionization and dissociation probabilities are presented in figure  5 on the timescale of 50  fs for the case when @xmath25 is excited by one - cycle laser pulse at the laser wavelength @xmath4  nm . note that ionization probabilities have been calculated with the respective time- and space - integrated outgoing fluxes separately for the negative and the positive direction of the @xmath2 axis ( curves  2 and 3 , respectively ) as well as for the outer end of the @xmath53 axis ( curve  1 ) .",
    "the dissociation probability ( curve  4 ) has been similarly calculated for the nuclear coordinate @xmath1 .    since the optimal laser - pulse amplitude required to prepare @xmath25 at the energy of @xmath69  au at the laser wavelength @xmath4  nm is substantially larger than at larger wavelengths , both dissociation and ionization probabilities presented in figure  5 are the largest obtained in this work .",
    "it is seen from figure  5 that the ionization probability for the outer end of the @xmath53 axis is larger than those for both negative and positive direction of the @xmath2 axis .",
    "this can be explained by the aforementioned fact that the electronic density is delocalized in the @xmath3 direction twice per every cycle of electronic @xmath2-oscillations , giving rise to the frequency - doubling of electronic @xmath3-oscillations as compared to electronic @xmath2-oscillations .",
    "it is also seen from figure  5 that ionization starts much prior to dissociation , therefore ` ionizative dissociation ' occurs . indeed , the decrease of the electron density between the two protons due to ionization disturbs the initial equilibrium configuration of @xmath25 and thus allows the coulombic repulsion of the protons to act more efficiently resulting in the elongation of the internuclear distance in @xmath25 and its subsequent dissociation .     for @xmath25 excited by the one - cycle laser pulses at @xmath4  nm ( curve  1 , @xmath93  au , @xmath94  au , @xmath95  fs ) , @xmath96  nm ( curve  2 , @xmath97  au , @xmath98  au , @xmath99  fs ) , @xmath100  nm ( curve  3 , @xmath101  au , @xmath102  au , @xmath103  fs ) and @xmath20  nm ( curve  4 , @xmath104  au , @xmath105  au , @xmath106  fs).,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    the time - dependent expectation values @xmath107 of internuclear distances in @xmath25 are presented in figure  6 on the timescale of 50  fs for the laser wavelengths of @xmath4  nm ( curve  1 ) , @xmath96  nm ( curve  2 ) , @xmath100  nm ( curve  3 ) and @xmath20  nm ( curve  4 ) .",
    "it is seen from figure  6 that at @xmath96 , 100 and 200  nm ( curves  2 , 3 and 4 , respectively ) , the time - dependent internuclear distances @xmath1 behave very similar to each other , all demonstrating local maxima at @xmath108  fs and at @xmath109  fs ( elongation of the bond ) as well as local minima at @xmath110  fs ( contraction of the bond length ) . curve  1 , corresponding to the case of @xmath4  nm , looks at a first glance as an exception due to much more substantial increase of the bond length caused by a comparatively strong laser field applied to prepare @xmath25 close to its dissociation threshold and , therefore , more efficient ionizative dissociation of @xmath25 resulting in a more substantial overall bond elongation .",
    "nevertheless , both elongation and contraction of the internuclear distance can be seen in curve  1 as well . since the nuclear motion in the symmetric @xmath25 molecule is activated only by the electronic motion induced by the laser field along the @xmath2 axis , it is interesting to find a correlation between the nuclear motion and post - laser - field electronic @xmath2-oscillations .        in figure  7 post - laser - field electronic oscillations",
    "are presented by the time - dependent expectation values @xmath89 for the same laser wavelengths @xmath67 as in figure  6 .",
    "it is clearly seen from figure  7 that local minima of the coulomb force @xmath89 correspond to local maxima of the bond length @xmath107 of @xmath25 ( elongation of the bond ) , while the local maximum of the coulomb force @xmath89 at @xmath110  fs corresponds to the local minimum of the bond length ( contraction of the bond length ) .",
    "we can conclude therefore , that periodic elongation - contraction of the bond of @xmath25 ( figure  6 ) is controlled by compressing - expanding electron acceleration along the @xmath2 axis ( figure  7 ) which takes place with the period of @xmath111  fs corresponding to the frequency @xmath112 of shaped post - laser - field oscillations occurring with the carrier oscillation frequency @xmath83  au ( corresponding to the wavelength of @xmath8  nm ) .",
    "similar electron - nuclei correlations were found in our recent work @xcite where two - cycle laser pulses were used to excite @xmath25 and a more detailed explanation is given for post - laser - field electron - nuclei correlations in terms of below - resonance vibrational frequency @xcite and for the existence of characteristic oscillation frequency @xmath113 ( corresponding to @xmath8  nm ) in terms of a continuum state @xmath114 prepared by the laser pulses .",

    "it is seen from figures  8(a ) and 8(b ) that expectation values @xmath11 and @xmath115 first demonstrate fast oscillations on the time interval of about @xmath116  fs .",
    "again , two major frequencies of electronic @xmath3-oscillations can be distinguished at a close look : @xmath13 ( @xmath85  nm ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath87  nm ) . the frequency - doubling of electronic @xmath3-oscillations has been already described in section  3 and presented in figures  3(c ) and 3(f ) therein .    afterwards , at @xmath117  fs , expectation values @xmath11 demonstrate a rather smooth behavior , with the electron excursion along the transversal @xmath3 coordinate being quite strongly dependent of the laser pulse amplitude used to excite @xmath25 initially along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "it is also seen from figure  8(b ) that there exists a nice correlation between the time - dependent @xmath115 values and the internuclear distances @xmath107 of figure  6 . indeed , at @xmath96 , 100 and 200  nm [ curves  2 , 3 and 4 , respectively , in both figure  6 and figure  8(b ) ] , local maxima of both @xmath115 and @xmath107 occur at @xmath108  fs and at @xmath109  fs , while their local minima occur at @xmath110  fs . since no frequency - doubling of post - laser - field electronic @xmath3-oscillations ( as compared to @xmath2-oscillations ) takes place , we conclude that the low - frequency oscillations of @xmath115 at @xmath118  fs are induced by the periodic elongation - contraction of the bond length in @xmath25 ( figure  6 ) , rather than by post - laser - field electronic @xmath2-oscillations ( figure  7 ) . again , since the periodic elongation - contraction of the bond length in @xmath25 is very small at @xmath4  nm ( curve  1 in figure  6 ) , local maxima and minima of @xmath115 are not seen at @xmath4  nm as well [ curve  1 in figure  8(b ) ] .",
    "in this section we present the power spectra generated by post - laser - field electronic motion calculated in the acceleration form , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , for the electron coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to show with the ehrenfest s theorem , that the acceleration of the expectation value @xmath121 can be written in the following form : @xmath122\\ , .",
    "\\label{z - acceleration - long}\\ ] ] since the applied laser field aligned along the @xmath2 axis does not excite the transversal @xmath53 degree of freedom directly , its excitation can occur only due to the wave properties of electron .",
    "therefore , the electric - field term @xmath34 does not appear in the equation for the acceleration of the expectation value @xmath11 at all .",
    "it can also be shown , by making use of ehrenfest s theorem , that the acceleration of the expectation value @xmath123 reads @xmath124    the power spectrum @xmath125 of any time - dependent expectation value @xmath126 is defined by the squared modulus of the fourier transform : @xmath127 where @xmath128    in the case under consideration , the time - dependent expectation value @xmath126 in equation  ( [ s - ft ] ) will stand accordingly for @xmath129 defined by equation  ( [ z - acceleration - long ] ) , or for @xmath130 defined by equation  ( [ rho - acceleration ] ) . in the given above definitions we took into account that the power spectra defined by equations  ( [ s - ft ] ) and ( [ s - definition ] ) do not depend on the sign of @xmath131 .",
    "as it was discussed earlier ( section  3.1 ) , power spectra resulting from excitation of @xmath25 close to its dissociation threshold at various laser wavelengths @xmath73  nm might always generate harmonics corresponding to @xmath133  nm due to the most efficient excitation of @xmath25 at this wavelength ( figure  2 ) .",

    "we can conclude therefore that at the laser wavelength @xmath100  nm one lower - order and one `` identical '' harmonic are generated by the optically active @xmath2 degree of freedom of @xmath25 .    in the power spectrum @xmath136 generated by the optically passive @xmath3 degree of freedom ,",

    "indeed , while the strongest lower - order harmonic at @xmath137  nm corresponds to @xmath14 , and a weaker lower order harmonic at @xmath133  nm corresponds to @xmath13 , the other harmonic corresponding to @xmath14 , at @xmath142  nm , is the higher - order harmonic with respect to the laser wavelength @xmath100  nm used to excite @xmath25 .",
    "we can conclude therefore , that the laser wavelength of @xmath100  nm manifests itself as a beginning of the appearance of the higher - order harmonics , at least in the power spectra @xmath120 generated by the optically passive , transversal @xmath3 degree of freedom .",
    "the physical reason behind this feature is the above described frequency - doubling of the electronic @xmath3-oscillations , with respect to the laser - initiated electronic @xmath2-oscillations , caused by the wave - properties of an electron .",

    "it is clearly seen from figure  12(a ) for the @xmath119 spectrum that the strongest harmonic at @xmath133  nm is still the lower - order harmonic with respect to the laser wavelength @xmath81  nm used to excite @xmath25 , while the other , a weak harmonic at @xmath146  nm , is the higher - order harmonic .    in the power spectrum @xmath120 of figure  12(b ) for the optically passive @xmath3 degree of freedom , the lower - order harmonic at @xmath141  nm corresponding to @xmath13 is not the strongest one anymore .",
    "the strongest harmonic at @xmath147  nm is a higher - order harmonic , as well as a weaker one at @xmath148  nm , both corresponding to @xmath14 the accordance with the frequency - doubling of the electronic @xmath3-oscillations .",
    "we can conclude therefore from the results presented in this section ( figures  9 through 12 ) that when the laser wavelength @xmath67 increases from small values of about 25  nm and approaches 200  nm , generation of higher - order harmonics starts , due to the frequency - doubling of the electronic @xmath3-oscillations , from the optically passive @xmath3 degree of freedom at @xmath100  nm [ figure  11(b ) ] and develops such that both @xmath120 and @xmath119 power spectra have higher - order harmonics at @xmath81  nm ( figure  12 ) .      as it was already discussed in section  3.1 and depicted in figure  2 therein , there are two different domains of the laser wavelength @xmath67 characterizing the efficiency of excitation of @xmath25 to the energy close to its dissociation threshold by one - cycle and two - cycle laser pulses .",
    "the domain of @xmath71  nm to be considered in this section corresponds to a very small change of the optimal laser pulse amplitude @xmath48 required to excite @xmath25 from its ground state to the energy of @xmath69  au .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath92  nm is still the most efficient laser wavelength ( see figure  2 ) , we can expect that power spectra resulting from excitation of @xmath25 at various laser wavelengths @xmath71  nm would contain harmonics corresponding to @xmath74  nm .     excited by the one - cycle laser pulse at @xmath20  nm ( @xmath104  au , @xmath105  au , @xmath106  fs ) : ( a ) power spectrum @xmath119 generated by the optically active @xmath2 degree of freedom ; ( b ) power spectrum @xmath120 generated by the optically passive , transversal @xmath3 degree of freedom.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    in figure  13 , power spectra in the acceleration form , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , generated due to the laser - initiated electron motion along the @xmath2 coordinate , are presented for the case when @xmath25 is excited by one - cycle laser pulse at the laser wavelength of @xmath20  nm .",
    "it is seen from figure  13(a ) that the strongest harmonic in the @xmath134 spectrum generated by the optically active @xmath2 degree of freedom is the first , or identical harmonic corresponding to the wavelength of @xmath133  nm , while a much weaker , the second - order harmonic corresponds to @xmath146  nm .",
    "the appearance of the second - order harmonic in the power spectrum @xmath134 of the symmetric @xmath25 molecule is the specific feature of one - cycle and two - cycle @xcite laser pulses , because if laser pulses with many optical cycles are used to excite a symmetric molecule , even harmonics should not appear in the power spectra generated by optically active degrees of freedom at all , as suggested by the concept of inversion symmetry @xcite .    in the power spectrum @xmath136 generated by the optically passive @xmath3 degree of freedom ,",
    "figure  13(b ) , the strongest second - order harmonic at @xmath149  nm corresponds to the doubled frequency of @xmath3-oscillations @xmath14 , while a weaker , the first - order harmonic at @xmath150  nm , corresponds to @xmath13 .",

    "the higher - order harmonic at @xmath154  nm is the second - order harmonic with respect to the smallest - frequency harmonic at @xmath133  nm appeared in the @xmath119 power spectrum .",

    "since the smallest - frequency harmonics in all power spectra @xmath120 generated by the optically - passive @xmath3 degree of freedom [ figures  9(b ) through 14(b ) ] also correspond to @xmath92  nm , a new nomenclature of the harmonic order described above for @xmath119 power spectra can be used to analyze power spectra @xmath120 as well .",
    "indeed , it is seen from figure  14(b ) that the higher - order harmonic with the smallest - frequency is that at @xmath156  nm , while the higher - order harmonic at @xmath149  nm is approximately the second - order harmonic with respect to the smallest - frequency one ( at @xmath156  nm ) and the third - order harmonic with respect to the laser wavelength of @xmath90  nm used to excite @xmath25 .",

    "in the present work , the non - born - oppenheimer quantum dynamics of @xmath25 excited by linearly polarized along the molecular axis shaped one - cycle laser pulses has been numerically studied at different laser - carrier frequencies corresponding to the laser wavelengths of @xmath16025 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 and 400  nm .",
    "the amplitudes of the one - cycles laser pulses have been optimized such that the energy of @xmath25 at the end of each pulse , @xmath23  au , was close from the below to its dissociation threshold . for the sake of completeness",
    ", some results were obtained by making use of two - cycle laser pulses as well .",
    "the present work provides a detailed and in - depth extension of our previous study @xcite where shaped two - cycle laser pulses at the laser wavelengths of @xmath160800 and 200  nm were used to excite @xmath25 close to its dissociation threshold .",
    "the basic results obtained in the present work are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the most efficient excitation of @xmath25 by one - cycle shaped laser pulses , which requires the minimum laser electric - field amplitude to achieve the required energy of about -0.515  au at the end of the pulse , takes place at the laser wavelength of @xmath72  nm corresponding to the laser - carrier frequency of @xmath161  au .",
    "this frequency plays the role of a characteristic oscillation frequency @xmath83  au and manifests itself as the carrier frequency of temporally shaped post - laser - field oscillations of the time - dependent expectation values @xmath9 and @xmath10 corresponding to the optically active @xmath2 degree of freedom , which exist on a long timescale of at least 50  fs after the ends of the pulses used to excite @xmath25 initially .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath25 excited by two - cycle shaped laser pulses @xcite are almost identical .",
    "\\(ii ) the optically passive , transversal @xmath3 degree of freedom , which is excited only due to the wave properties of the electron , also demonstrates post - laser - field oscillations of the time - dependent expectation values @xmath11 and @xmath12 which occur at two basic frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the latter frequency corresponds to the frequency - doubling of electronic @xmath3-oscillations as compared to electronic @xmath2-oscillations described previously @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) a characteristic feature of power spectra generated by @xmath2 and @xmath3 degrees of freedom when @xmath25 is excited by one - cycle laser pulses is a small number of generated harmonics : not more than three relatively strong harmonics can be observed in the power spectra presented in section  3.3 .",
    "a similar feature was observed in the case when @xmath25 was excited by two - cycle laser pulses @xcite . in a more general case ,",
    "the number of generated harmonics correlates with the number of optical cycles used to excite a molecule , with the overall trend being `` the smaller optical cycles used to excite a molecule is , the smaller number of harmonics is generated '' . such a correlation was discussed in more detail in our previous work @xcite for both ordinary ( electronic ) and muonic molecules .",
    "\\(iv ) the positions of many peaks in power spectra presented in section  3.3 are not equal to integer multiples of the laser carrier frequency @xmath50 , especially in the case of lower - order harmonic generation at @xmath162  nm described in section  3.3.1 .",
    "it is known @xcite that such harmonics may be be generated by single atoms and molecules due to resonance effects . in the current case of one - cycle laser pulses used to excite @xmath25 close to its dissociation threshold and the resonant properties of this process depicted in figure  2 , the situation can be rationalized by introducing the suggested above new nomenclature of the harmonic order @xmath163 as follows .",
    "since the smallest - frequency harmonics in all power spectra @xmath119 and @xmath120 presented in section  3.3 correspond to the optimal wavelength @xmath72  nm , a new harmonic order @xmath164 can be defined as follows : @xmath165    it is easy to check that equation  ( [ new - harm - order ] ) works very well for all power spectra @xmath119 and is also quite suitable for power spectra @xmath120 where the frequencies of strongest harmonics are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
