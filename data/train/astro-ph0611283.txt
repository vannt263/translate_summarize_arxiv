    "in the past few years measurement of the evolution of galaxy luminosity functions at a broad range of wavelengths has rapidly matured .",
    "one consequence of this has been the refinement in our understanding of how the space density of the galaxy star formation rate ( sfr ) evolves @xcite .",
    "in particular the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) is now quite tightly constrained ( to within @xmath2 ) up to redshifts of @xmath3 . combined with measurements at higher redshifts",
    "the sfh is well determined ( within a factor of about 3 at @xmath4 ) up to @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additional results from the super - kamiokande ( sk ) particle detector provide a strong limit on the electron antineutrino ( @xmath6 ) flux , 1.2@xmath7s@xmath8 ( for @xmath9mev ) , originating from supernova type  ii events associated with the sfh @xcite .",
    "this limit on the diffuse supernova neutrino background ( dsnb ) constrains the normalisation of the sfh @xcite .",
    "an exploration of quantities predicted from the sfh , the stellar and metal mass density evolution , and supernova ( sn ) rate evolution , provides further insight into the allowable normalisation of the sfh @xcite .",
    "this series of interconnected physical properties of galaxies and sne provides an emerging opportunity for determining the level of the sfh normalisation , and the sfh measurements particularly for @xmath10 now have the precision to allow this exploration of their accuracy .",
    "constraining the normalisation of the sfh will support a range of quantitative analyses of galaxy evolution , including the mass - dependence of the sfh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the reasons underlying the decline in the sfh to low redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis of the constraints on the sfh normalisation are detailed in @xcite , and here the main arguments are summarised .",
    "since optical snii can be hidden from observations by dust obscuration , the present snii rate density measurements may merely be lower limits , and serve as a lower bound on the allowable sfh normalisation . in contrast , since neutrinos are unaffected by dust , the dsnb provides an absolute upper limit on the true snii rate .",
    "we assume @xmath11kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the compilation of @xcite was taken as the starting point for this analysis , and uses their  common \" obscuration correction where necessary .",
    "additional measurements are indicated in figure  [ fig : sfh ] , and are detailed in @xcite .      to implement effective obscuration corrections for the uv measurements at @xmath10 , we take advantage of the well - established fir sfr densities up to @xmath14 from @xcite .",
    "the uv data at @xmath15 are  obscuration corrected \" by adding the fir sfr density from @xcite to each point .",
    "as shown by @xcite for individual systems , this technique results in @xmath16 estimates consistent with the obscuration corrected h@xmath17 measurements .",
    "this result is consistent with the interpretation of @xcite that about half the sfr density in the local universe is obscured by dust , increasing to about 80% by @xmath3 . for obscuration corrections to the uv data between @xmath18 we rely on the fact that the fir measurements of @xcite are quite flat in this domain , as well as being highly consistent with those of @xcite at @xmath19 , and add the constant sfr density corresponding to that of @xcite at @xmath14",
    "this is also consistent with the recent measurements of obscuration corrections for uv luminosities at @xmath20 by @xcite , who find a typical correction factor of @xmath21 . at higher redshifts",
    "we apply a  common \" obscuration correction to the uv data as detailed in @xcite .      while uncertainties in sfr calibration act to increase",
    "the scatter in the sfh , and uncertainties in dust obscuration can raise it to greater or lesser degrees , the choice of imf is the only assumption that can systematically _ decrease _ the sfh normalisation .",
    "a modified @xcite imf , with a turnover below @xmath22 , remains a reasonable model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and other currently favoured imfs include those of @xcite and @xcite . the factor to convert sfh measurements from a traditional @xcite imf to the imf of ( *",
    "* hereafter bg imf ) is @xmath23 ( @xmath24dex ) .",
    "to convert to the modified salpeter a imf ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter sala imf ) is a factor of 0.77 ( @xmath25dex ) .",
    "the @xcite imf and the modified salpeter b imf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter salb imf ) have scale factors intermediate between these choices . with these two extreme imf choices",
    "we expect to provide bounds encompassing the result from choosing any reasonable imf in our subsequent analysis .",
    "to derive a @xmath6 flux from the dsnb for comparison with the limits from sk , we first fit a functional form to the sfh .",
    "we use the parametric form of @xcite : @xmath26 , here with @xmath27 .",
    "the individual @xmath16 measurements chosen to constrain this fit are also important since the resulting fit will obviously vary depending on the data used .",
    "the details of the data selected are given in @xcite , and the results shown in figure  [ fig : sfhfit ] .",
    "the final parametric fitting is a simple @xmath28 fit to the 58 selected @xmath16 measurements spanning @xmath29 .      as a brief aside ,",
    "it is worth discussing star formation at @xmath30 , as there are now a large number of estimates in the literature spanning this range .",
    "these primarily use the photometric dropout technique to select lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , often using relatively small , very deep fields ( including the great observatories origins deep survey , goods , and the hubble ultra deep field , hudf )",
    ". measurements of ly@xmath17 emission typically show sfh measurements significantly lower than those from lbgs .",
    "it is not clear whether the same populations are being probed here , or the full extent of the selection biases that may be present .",
    "the @xmath30 sfh contributes a negligible fraction to the integrated sfh that produces the dsnb , and is neglected in the subsequent analysis .",
    "it is , however , of great significance to the epoch of reionisation , and star formation may in fact play the dominant role here . figure  [ fig : sfhzgt6 ] shows the measurements of the @xmath30 sfh , based on rest - frame uv luminosities",
    "not corrected for obscuration effects .",
    "the dashed line in this figure is the level of sfr density required for reionisation at a given redshift @xcite assuming @xmath31 , appropriate for unobscured uv emission , and a clumping factor @xmath32 .",
    "although the issue of dust obscuration at high redshift is still highly uncertain , some data is beginning to be obtained .",
    "in addition to the @xmath33 estimates from @xcite , intriguing evidence for significant obscuration ( @xmath34mag ) at @xmath35 has recently been established through spitzer observations of a lensed lyman @xmath17 ( ly@xmath17 ) emitting source @xcite .",
    "this implies that the first epoch of star formation in this source must have occurred around @xmath36 .",
    "this is also supported by spectroscopic ly@xmath17 emission measurements of lbgs at @xmath37 @xcite , suggesting that the bright lbgs ( at least ) lie in dusty , chemically evolved systems at this redshift .",
    "one promising suggestion here is that the cosmic sfh beyond @xmath38 can be probed through galaxy archeology , i.e. , by determining the star formation histories of the @xmath38 galaxy population ( see also r .- r .",
    "chary 2006 , this proceedings ) .",
    "the dsnb derived from the cosmic sfh is calculated as follows .",
    "the @xmath39 is first converted to a type  ii supernova rate history , @xmath40 . for the imfs explored here @xmath41 for the bg imf and @xmath42 for the sala imf . the predicted differential neutrino flux ( per unit energy )",
    "is then calculated by integrating @xmath40 multiplied by the @xmath6 emission per supernova , appropriately redshifted , over cosmic time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . finally , this energy spectrum is integrated above 19.3mev to establish the @xmath6 flux for comparison with the sk limit of 1.2@xmath7s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we explore the implication of assuming a temperature of @xmath43mev , 6mev , or 8mev . given the @xmath6 flux for each temperature , we simply scale the best fitting sfh to ensure the sk limit is not violated .",
    "the best fit sfhs independent of the @xmath6 limit are identical to the fits constrained by a @xmath6 temperature of @xmath44mev .",
    "as found and discussed in @xcite , our results favour effective temperatures at the lower end of the predicted range .",
    "in addition to the @xcite parameterisation , we also explored a piecewise linear sfh model in @xmath45 space , in order to test the possibility that the @xcite parametric model could be biasing the shape of the resulting sfh fit in some way . in this model",
    "we allow the following six parameters to vary : the @xmath46 intercept , the slopes of three linear segments and the two redshift values at which the slopes change .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfh ] shows the current sfh data compilation ( assuming the sala imf ) emphasising the additional data used in this analysis compared to the compilation of @xcite .",
    "the best fitting @xcite form for this imf is also shown as is the best - fitting piecewise linear fit . figure  [ fig : sfhfit ] shows the data used in the fitting and the best fits assuming three temperature values for the @xmath6 population for each imf assumed .",
    "the fitting parameters are tabulated in @xcite",
    ".    for both assumed imfs it can clearly be seen that the assumption of @xmath47mev , when the sfh is required to be consistent with the @xmath6 flux limit , is inconsistent with the sfh measurements . also for both imfs , the best fitting sfh assuming @xmath48mev is identical to that assuming @xmath44mev .",
    "this can be understood by considering the sala imf , for example , with the higher sfh normalisation , but which also has a lower conversion factor between @xmath16 and @xmath49 , causing the predicted @xmath6 flux to be within the sk limit even with the assumption of the slightly higher neutrino temperature . for both imf assumptions",
    "we determine the @xmath50 ( grey - shaded ) and @xmath51 ( hatched ) confidence regions around the best fitting sfh ( corresponding to @xmath52 or @xmath53mev ) .",
    "subsequent figures reproduce these confidence regions in the predictions for stellar and metal mass density evolution ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively ) and sn rate evolution ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the shape of the @xmath6 energy spectra corresponding to the various fits for the different imf and temperature assumptions are shown in figure  [ fig : sneas ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : stars ] shows the evolution of the stellar mass density , @xmath54 , ( a far more extensive compilation of data appears in figure  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the metal mass density , @xmath55 , as inferred from the sfh @xcite . the predictions from the best fitting sfh are also shown .",
    "for the evolution of @xmath54 we need to know the fraction of the stellar mass recycled into the interstellar medium as stellar winds or sn ejecta , @xmath57 , corresponding to each imf @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath58 for the sala imf , and @xmath59 for the bg imf .",
    "the stellar mass inferred is then a fraction @xmath60 of the time integral of the sfh @xcite . converting the observed stellar mass density measurements ( where a salpeter imf is assumed ) to our assumed imfs",
    "is achieved by scaling by the product of the sfr conversion factor and the ratio of the @xmath61 factor for the chosen imf to that of the salpeter imf ( where @xmath62 ) .",
    "the @xmath54 measurements in figure  [ fig : stars ] clearly lie systematically below the predictions from the sfh .",
    "simulations suggest that the measurements might be underestimating the total @xmath54 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "discussion by @xcite imply that it is perhaps not unreasonable to expect about a factor of two larger stellar mass densities as a result of reasonable obscuration levels .",
    "other issues that have also been raised include incomplete galaxy population sampling and cosmic variance that may affect surveys probing small fields of view ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low redshift ,",
    "the discrepancy between the measurements of @xmath54 and the sfh prediction is more of a concern , and is discussed further by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    to determine @xmath55 from the sfh , we assume that @xmath63 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". at @xmath46 the compilation of data from @xcite is shown , and these authors favour a value of @xmath64mpc@xmath65 .",
    "values at @xmath46 and @xmath66 from @xcite are also shown , suggesting that the evolution in @xmath67 from the sfh may be consistent with that estimated from the dusty submillimeter galaxy ( smg ) population , although recent results from @xcite indicate that the smgs may contribute much less to the metal mass density at high redshift .",
    "investigating the predictions of @xmath68 from the sfh are complicated by the limited number of estimates for this quantity at @xmath69 .",
    "this is observationally a difficult measurement to make , particularly as much of the metals may exist in an ionised intergalactic medium component ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : snrate1 ] shows the evolution in the sn rate for both types ia and ii sne .",
    "the snii rate density , @xmath49 , can be calculated directly from the sfh .",
    "the snia rate density , @xmath70 , involves more assumptions about the properties of snia events than in the case of snii .",
    "see @xcite for details of these calculations .",
    "the @xmath49 measurements provide a strong lower bound on the normalisation of the sfh .",
    "particularly given that uncertainty regarding obscuration corrections is more likely to raise than lower the @xmath49 measurements , the sfh normalisation can not realistically be much lower than that obtained from assuming the bg imf ( figure  [ fig : sfhfit]b ) . moreover , the @xmath49 measurements are unlikely to be affected by sufficient obscuration to support an sfh normalisation much higher than that obtained with the sala imf @xcite .    the prediction for @xmath70 from the sfh is also particularly intriguing .",
    "the assumption of the fixed @xmath71gyr has the effect of matching the @xmath72 turnover in the fitted sfh with the apparent decline in @xmath70 seen in the highest redshift measurement from the goods sample of @xcite .",
    "it is possible , indeed probable , that this is simply a coincidence as it is a single @xmath70 measurement , with large uncertainties , that is suggestive of the decline , and the turnover in the sfh is driven almost entirely by the @xmath38 measurement of @xcite .",
    "it is thus still highly possible that the decline in both the sfh and @xmath70 lie at somewhat higher redshift ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the sfh compilation of @xcite has been updated , emphasising the strong constraints from recent uv and fir measurements , and refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade .",
    "the results of parametric fits to the sfh , constrained by the sk @xmath6 limit , suggest that the preferred imf should produce normalisations within the range of those from the modified salpeter a imf @xcite and the imf of @xcite .",
    "they also suggest that lower temperatures ( @xmath73mev ) are preferred for the @xmath6 population .",
    "based on the fits to the sfh we predict the evolution of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and compare with observations .",
    "the @xmath77 measurements provide a key constraint on the sfh normalisation , and correspondingly on the favoured imf . in particular , these data bound the sfh from _ below _ , while the dsnb bounds the sfh from _",
    "above_. together , these provide a novel technique for testing or verifying measurements of a universal imf .",
    "more measurements of @xmath76 for both type  ii and ia sne over a broader redshift range would help to more strongly constrain both the preferred universal imf and the properties of sne . observing the high redshift turnover in the snia rate would also have strong implications for the location of the expected high redshift turnover in the sfh .    with the best fitting sfh models explored here , the predictions for the dsnb appear to lie excitingly close to the measured @xmath6 flux limit .",
    "direct observation of the dsnb will clearly allow much greater insight into the physics and astrophysics of star formation and supernovae .",
    "already the dsnb constraint indicates a preferred imf range and normalisation for the sfh .",
    "it also illustrates that stronger constraints on the sfh have implications for understanding the details of both snii and snia production , and the physical basis of neutrino generation by snii is intimately associated with all these predictions .",
    "being able to detect the dsnb and its energy spectrum will allow a more sophisticated analysis of the detailed connections between all these aspects of star formation and the cosmic sfh .",
    "methods for increasing the sensitivity of particle detectors to dsnb antineutrinos and neutrinos have been detailed elsewhere , and @xcite summarise some of these proposals .",
    "i thank john beacom for getting me interested in the constraints enabled through the sk measurements , and for all his help in understanding the details .",
    "i also acknowledge support provided by the australian research council in the form of a qeii fellowship ( dp0557850 ) .",
