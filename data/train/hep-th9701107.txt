    "to be precise , the continuum relativistic qft defined on the infinite minkowski plane follows by first taking the ir limit @xmath17 ( that is @xmath18 at fixed @xmath10 ) and then the uv limit @xmath19 near the critical point @xmath20 , holding @xmath21 fixed . on the other hand , by taking the continuum limit ( @xmath15 ) at fixed @xmath1 , we get instead the same qft on a ring of length @xmath1 .",
    "it is this second procedure that we wish to study here .",
    "let us also recall that the sg model has two distinct regimes , one repulsive , for @xmath22 , and one attractive , for @xmath23 .",

    "the soliton / antisoliton states appears as holes in the ground state distribution of ba roots ; the breather states appear instead as special configurations of complex roots ( see below ) .",

    "we analyze the distribution of real roots for generic excited states in secs .",

    ", it takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of holes , @xmath78 is the number of special holes , @xmath79 the number of close roots and @xmath80 the number of wide roots . notice that @xmath81 acts as the effective hole number .",
    "concerning the complex roots , our analysis fully uses the non - string complex roots @xcite .",
    "bethe strings do not appear as generic solutions in our approach .",
    "these non - string complex roots do not contribute to the energy ",

    "momentum appear in the infinite volume limit .",
    "such arrays only contain wide roots and describe hole bound states ( breathers ) .",
    "the nlie is therefore an useful starting point to find the spectrum of excited states both numerically or analytically in the large @xmath83 ( perturbative ) and small @xmath83 ( conformal ) regimes .    in section viii",

    "this lemma yields the integral involved in the eigenvalue calculation in close form without knowing the solution of the nlie .",

    "we find that the ( uv ) sg conformal spectrum is related with the ( ir ) six - vertex conformal spectrum ( which coincides with the ir conformal spectrum for the xxz chain ) by a duality transformation @xmath85 .",
    "some simple excited states are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "the ba roots are either real or come in complex conjugated pairs @xmath86 , with the exception of single roots at @xmath87 or @xmath88 , which are actually self  conjugated due to @xmath89 periodicity [ see eqs . - ] .",
    "it is well known that the ground state , or vacuum in the qft language , corresponds to the unique ba solution with @xmath90 real roots for the entire range @xmath91 .",
    "then in any physically relevant transfer matrix eigenstate there are @xmath92 real roots @xmath93 and @xmath94 complex roots @xmath95 with @xmath92 of order @xmath90 and @xmath96 of order one .",
    "moreover , we recall that @xmath97 is the eigenvalue of conserved u(1 ) charge ( the third component of the total spin in the six ",

    "this removes any @xmath32 ambiguity on the `` quantum numbers '' @xmath99 .",
    "notice that @xmath102 is monotonic function .",
    "moreover , since @xmath90 may be chosen to be even ( eventually @xmath18 ) , the parity of @xmath100 is the same of @xmath103 , so that the @xmath99 are half - odd - integers for @xmath34 even and integers for @xmath34 odd .",
    "therefore we may write in general @xmath104\\ ] ]    @xmath105 * the counting function *    given a solution @xmath6 of the bae , we define the corresponding _ counting function _ as @xmath106             -\\sum_{k=1}^m \\phi_1(\\l-\\l_k)\\ ] ] comparing eq . to eq .",
    "we have by definition @xmath107 as stated above , the ba root @xmath6 must all be distinct ( the corresponding ba state would otherwise vanish ) .",
    "once specialized to the real roots , eq . reads @xmath108 we naturally assume the ordering @xmath109 . furthermore , we anticipate that the size of the distribution of real roots is of order @xmath110 for large @xmath111 , that is @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath105 * holes *    distinct real numbers @xmath114 , @xmath115 , that are also distinct from the real ba roots @xmath93 but satisfy the same quantization rule , that is @xmath116 with the @xmath117 integers or half - integers , are called _",
    "again we assume the ordering @xmath118 .",
    "together with the real ba roots the holes form the complete set of real zeroes of the function @xmath119 we denote this set as @xmath120 and assume it ordered .",
    "@xmath105 * special root / holes *    in the counting function the term @xmath121 $ ] , which is monotonically increasing over the real line , acts as source of possible quantum numbers for real roots and holes ( a sort of phase space ) .",
    "each summand in the sum over roots either subtracts or add phase space depending on the sign of @xmath122 and the imaginary part of the root . in general , in any zero  temperature physical state , the global effect is to produce a @xmath123 which is monotonically increasing on the real line , but there could be exceptions , as we shall now discuss .",
    "let us call `` bulk regions '' the portions of the real line where @xmath124 is positive and of order @xmath90 for large @xmath90 .",
    "in such regions the spacing between consecutive real roots is of order @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the number of roots within the bulk is of order @xmath90 .",
    "the regions around the two extremities of the real distribution are by definition not in the bulk and there @xmath126 may indeed change sign due to one or more isolated roots .",
    "another place where @xmath126 might change sign is the middle of the real distribution , which is peaked around @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the limit @xmath18 forces @xmath123 to be monotonic increasing for any fixed @xmath55 and @xmath14 . but for any arbitrarily large @xmath90 there could be specific configurations of quantum numbers and large enough values of @xmath129 and/or @xmath14 , such that @xmath130 is decreasing at the two extremities and/or in the middle of the real distribution .",
    "this possibilities are easily verified numerically .",
    "if @xmath123 decreases , it may decrease enough to cross downward a quantization point already crossed upwards .",
    "therefore the following classification become necessary .",
    "we shall define as _ non - degenerate _ those configurations of quantum numbers such that the union @xmath131 contains only * distinct * integers or half - odd - integers .",
    "this is automatically the case if @xmath132 at all zeroes of @xmath133 so that the ordering of the @xmath134 s implies the ordering of the corresponding quantum numbers @xmath135 .",
    "the _ degenerate _ configurations are those where one or more quantum numbers appear more than once in @xmath136 . evidently to such quantum numbers",
    "are associated at the same time real zeroes of @xmath137 with @xmath132 and real zeroes with @xmath138 .",
    "we call the latter * special * real roots or holes , root / holes for short , as opposed to the normal ones with @xmath139 .",
    "notice that two ( or more ) roots can not be associated to the same integer .",
    "if this would be the case , by continuity in @xmath140 and @xmath141 , one could cause these two roots to `` merge '' and thus obtain a double root of the bae which is to be discarded . hence to a degenerate quantum number is associated at most one real root , while the other are holes . the same continuity argument in the two free parameters @xmath59 and @xmath142 serves to deal with the exceptional cases @xmath143 .",
    "we may regard such cases as mergings of a real roots and a hole or of two holes . in either case",
    "they do not require a special treatment .",
    "extensive numerical studies have shown that degenerate configurations are restricted to few types . for large @xmath90 at fixed @xmath14 special root / holes may appear only at either one of the two tails of the real distribution , due to a single real or self  conjugated root or to a cluster of complex roots that become isolated from the bulk when @xmath140 gets close to one of a special set of rational multiples of @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath14 is large enough at fixed @xmath90 , then the distribution of real roots separates into two distinct distributions peaked around @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . in this case",
    "there could be special root / holes whenever one or more roots remain at a distance of order @xmath145 , rather than @xmath14 , from the origin and therefore become isolated .",
    "in this section we consider large @xmath90 at fixed @xmath14 and shall deal with the opposite regime of large @xmath14 at fixed @xmath90 in section [ largeth ] .",
    "let us consider here an explicit example of root / holes in the outside tails .",
    "we consider the ba states obtained by removing @xmath34 real roots from the ground state distribution .",
    "if @xmath146 , then one finds that there are @xmath147 allowed values for the quantum numbers .",
    "this follows from the limiting values @xmath148",
    "= \\pm [ { { n - s + 2 s}\\over{2 } } - \\frac{\\g s}{\\pi } ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] this is just right to accommodate @xmath149 real roots ( as required ) and @xmath150 holes .",
    "we are thus dealing with a non - degenerate configuration and this is confirmed numerically ( it can be done , for @xmath90 in the thousands and to high precision , on any modern personal computer ) .",
    "one finds also the following : if the smallest and largest of the @xmath151 real zeroes of @xmath137 ( say @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) are holes , then @xmath123 is globally monotonic ; if instead @xmath152 is a real root , then @xmath123 tends to @xmath154 from below and @xmath124 changes sign just before @xmath152 ; if @xmath153 is a real root , then @xmath123 tends to @xmath155 from above and @xmath124 changes sign just after @xmath153 .",
    "suppose now we let @xmath156 while keeping all quantum numbers fixed .",
    "one finds that when @xmath153 is a hole , it simply goes to @xmath157 and then `` jumps '' to the line @xmath158 ( so that it ceases to be a real zero ) when @xmath159 exceeds @xmath144 ; in the meantime @xmath123 remains monotonic in the right tail .",
    "the same scenario applies to the left tail if @xmath152 is a hole when @xmath146 , with the only difference that @xmath152 jumps to the line @xmath160 .",
    "[ the choice of sign in the two jumps is a consequence of our logarithmic branch conventions for the function @xmath161 and the request that all quantum numbers stay fixed ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath153 is a root , then @xmath155 tends to @xmath162 as @xmath156 , so that we may say that a special hole appears at @xmath157 .",
    "when @xmath163 exceeds @xmath144 this special hole moves in to a finite values @xmath164 until it collides from the right with the root @xmath153 for a certain , configuration  dependent value of @xmath140 .",
    "then the root and the hole split again , but now with @xmath165 and @xmath166 , while @xmath153 is now a special root .",
    "finally , as @xmath140 approaches the universal value @xmath167 , @xmath153 tends to @xmath157 and then jumps to @xmath158 when @xmath140 exceeds @xmath167 .",
    "notice that the interval @xmath168 of non ",
    "monotonicity shrinks to the single free ",
    "field point @xmath169 for @xmath170 .",
    "one can also check that , after the jump , @xmath164 is still the largest real zero of @xmath171 when @xmath172 , while a new special hole appears when @xmath170 .",
    "a specular description applies in the left tail .",
    "it should also be clear that the mechanisms just described may repeat for larger values of gamma , provided we start from suitable configurations .",
    "likewise , it is possible that clusters of @xmath173 complex roots become isolated and are then `` pushed to infinity '' for certain configurations and special values of @xmath140 .",
    "looking at the original bae one sees that these complex roots must tend asymptotically to form @xmath174strings with the same real parts and spacing @xmath175 in the imaginary direction @xcite .    @xmath105 * complex roots *    besides the classification of real roots and holes into normal and special types , it proves convenient to classify the complex roots @xmath176 , @xmath177 into _ close roots _ @xmath178 and _ wide roots_@xcite @xmath179 the self  conjugate roots need to be further divided into two distinct classes . the first class is formed by the real roots that have jumped to @xmath180 by passing through @xmath181 upon suitably varying @xmath140 at fixed quantum numbers , as we have described in the example above .",
    "the second class is formed by all other self  conjugated roots . that is , the first class are those self",
    " conjugated roots that become real roots if we make @xmath142 small enough keeping the state fixed .    when @xmath182 the total number , locations and quantum numbers of the self  conjugated roots of the second class are connected to those of the holes . when @xmath183 they are independent variables ( see eq .",
    "below ) and describe the lightest breather states . in either case the presence of such roots properly characterizes the ba state as an excited state and can not be eliminated just by varying @xmath140 .",
    "@xmath105 * relation among the various numbers of roots and holes *    it is fairly easy to establish a relation among the u(1 ) charge and the number of holes , special root / holes and complex roots . from the definition itself of the counting function ,",
    "eq . and the asymptotic values of the function @xmath102 we read @xmath184 where @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) is the number of wide roots above ( below ) the real line .",
    "on the other hand we have @xmath187 where @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) is the quantum number corresponding to the largest ( smallest ) real root or hole and @xmath190 is the mod @xmath32 residue ( obviously @xmath191 ) @xmath192 \\text { mod } 2\\pi      = -2\\g s + 2\\pi\\left\\lfloor\\tfrac12 + \\tfrac\\g\\pi\\,s \\right\\rfloor\\ ] ] so that @xmath193 evidently the total number of real zeroes of @xmath194 is @xmath195 where @xmath78 stands for the total number of special roots / holes .    on the other hand we have by definition @xmath196 so that we obtain the following general constraint between the total number of holes and of complex roots and the u(1 ) charge @xmath97 [ @xmath197 is the step function ] : @xmath198 the important fact about eq .",
    "is that it involves only quantities which are finite as @xmath18 .",
    "notice also that @xmath199 turns out to be always even .",
    "we may write eq . in a different way by introducing @xmath200 , the number of self  conjugated roots of the first class and the `` effective hole number '' @xmath201 notice that @xmath202 indeed stays constant throughout the processes described in the examples above .",
    "we now have the relation @xmath203 where evidently @xmath204 is the number of wide roots which are not self  conjugated roots of the first class .",
    "we may now develop the following interpretation for the complex roots .",
    "first of all we observe that , for any given configuration of quantum numbers , there exists sufficiently small values of @xmath140 such that @xmath205 and @xmath206",
    ". then @xmath207 from eq .",
    "and we see [ from eq . ]",
    "that the holes carry a u(1 ) charge @xmath208 if no complex roots are present , while this charge is lowered by @xmath145 for each close root and by @xmath209 for each wide root .",
    "next , as @xmath140 is raised while keeping all quantum numbers fixed , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath200 might become nonzero but @xmath202 stays fixed .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath199 holes present for small enough @xmath140 are all well within the real distribution , in the sense that their quantum numbers are of order @xmath145 rather than @xmath90 , then these holes stay normal for any value of @xmath140 and are exactly those counted by @xmath202 .",
    "we anticipate that that these configurations are exactly those relevant in the continuum limit ( see section [ continuum ] )    we may thus draw the conclusion that in the repulsive regime @xmath182 all complex roots ( other than self  conjugated roots of the first class ) act as _ parameters _ characterizing the various u(1 ) polarization states of @xmath202 _ normal holes _",
    "well within the distribution of real roots , which have u(1 ) charge @xmath212 .",
    "the allowed values for the quantum numbers of these complex roots must then be of order @xmath199 rather than @xmath90 , as can be verified by carefully analyzing the counting function of ba solutions found numerically .    in the attractive regime",
    "@xmath183 this interpretation holds for the close roots only . from eq .",
    "we see that adding wide roots does not change the u(1 ) charge of the @xmath202 holes since @xmath213 .",
    "thus , when @xmath183 , the wide roots appear as _ independent _ excitations not carrying any u(1 ) charge and with a phase space of order @xmath90 .",
    "these picture is made more precise but fully confirmed by appropriate calculations ( including those of the energy ",
    "momentum spectrum ) in the @xmath18 limit at fixed @xmath14 ( see section [ spec ] ) .",
    "when @xmath14 vanishes the bae reduce to those of the homogeneous six - vertex model and the xxz spin 1/2 chain with @xmath214 sites .",
    "this is the obvious correspondence . less obvious and more important for our purposes",
    "is the relation which follows in the limit @xmath215 at fixed @xmath90 . in this limit",
    "the bae split into two separate sets of twisted bae each relative to an xxz chain with @xmath90 sites .",
    "the two sets remain coupled by the twists , which depend on global properties of the original ba state as well as on those of the final pair . to see all this we may work directly with the counting function @xmath216 , in which we write out for clarity the dependence on @xmath14 .",
    "notice that this dependence is both explicit , in the source term proportional to @xmath90 , and implicit , through the ba roots themselves .",
    "as @xmath215 at fixed @xmath90 , almost all the roots separate into two sets , the left  moving and right  moving seas , having `` center of mass '' in @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively , and spreading of order @xmath217 for large @xmath90 .",
    "few roots may stay within finite regions for special values of @xmath140 or sufficiently symmetric root configurations , as will become clear below .",
    "let us split the @xmath100 ba roots into the two sets @xmath218 of the roots diverging as @xmath219 , which we shall call right and left  moving , respectively , plus the @xmath220 roots with a finite limit for @xmath221 .",

    "we may approximate @xmath216 for @xmath14 very large but finite , as @xmath244 thus @xmath216 has a large almost flat plateau which tends to @xmath245 as @xmath215 .",

    "@xmath245 , the height of the plateau , fixes the way the quantum numbers @xmath247 relative to real roots and holes are subdivided into those belonging to the two seas , that is the @xmath248 s associated to real roots and holes . in fact , just by definition we must have : @xmath249 on the other hand , if @xmath250 is nonzero , then @xmath216 keeps a nontrivial structure in the neighborhood of the origin ; this structure interpolates between two large plateaus with heights @xmath251 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath252 due to a single real root at @xmath253 , then @xmath216 can be approximated as @xmath254 but since @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is some integer plus @xmath257 , to leading order in @xmath14 we get @xmath258 .",
    "comparing with eq .",
    "this shows that the real root may stay at a finite location @xmath259 only for certain special values of @xmath140 , unless separately @xmath260 and @xmath261 .    as a matter of fact",
    "the situations characterized by a special value of @xmath140 bear a strict correspondence with those discussed in the example of section [ general ] .",
    "there we found that for certain special values of @xmath140 one extremal real root was pushed to infinity with respect to the bulk of the roots , which stayed localized in a finite region . here",
    "we find the same with respect to a bulk that moves to @xmath262 .",
    "the same argument may be repeated also for the threshold values of @xmath140 beyond which special root / hole appear ; it suffices to translate the discussion of section [ general ] to the inner tails of the real distributions , that is the right tail of the left sea and the left tail of the right sea .",
    "there is an important difference , however : in the discussion of section [ general ] all special values of @xmath140 are functions of the total spin @xmath34 , which is the sum @xmath263 for generic situations ; here they are functions of the difference @xmath237 .",
    "so , let us recall that in the example of section [ general ] we dealt with the states obtained by removing @xmath34 real roots from the ground state distribution . as in section [ general ] we begin",
    "with the range @xmath264 for which the configuration is non - degenerate and then follow its evolution as @xmath140 grows .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath34 is even and the @xmath150 holes are equally divided into @xmath265 right  moving and @xmath266 left  moving ones ( so that @xmath261 , see eq . ) while @xmath267 and @xmath268 are occupied by holes . in this case",
    "nothing special happens in the central part of the root distribution when @xmath14 is very large and @xmath140 raises beyond @xmath269 .",
    "this is because the relevant phase space of each sea ( the right tail of the left sea and the left tail of the right sea ) receives from the twist caused by other sea exactly the same contribution that it looses due to the growth of @xmath140 .",
    "on the other hand the boundaries of the distribution ( the left tail of the left sea and the right tail for the right sea ) may develop special root / holes as discussed in section [ general ] .",
    "actually this scenario applies to the entire range of @xmath140 and therefore also applies to the passage through those points , such as @xmath270 , when extremal real roots jumps to the lines @xmath271 .",
    "this particular class of ba states is the one treated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now allow @xmath272 to be different from @xmath273 , but still impose that the @xmath274 and @xmath275 are occupied by holes .",

    "as @xmath140 exceeds @xmath280 , one hole passes from the sea with higher partial u(1 ) charge to the other , since the actual @xmath274 and @xmath275 increase by one for positive @xmath245 or decreases by one for negative @xmath245 .",
    "when @xmath140 is exactly equal to @xmath280 there is a hole with a finite limit as @xmath215 , since @xmath281 or @xmath282 .",
    "this example shows that even if @xmath283 , @xmath284 may differ from @xmath285 .",

    "notice also that a hole may stay trapped into a finite region only if @xmath140 assumes exactly one of a discrete set of values . hence we can regard this case as exceptional and always assume @xmath287 by continuity .",
    "when either one , or both , of the two quantum numbers closest to @xmath288 are occupied by real roots the situation gets more involved due to the appearance of special root / holes .",
    "for instance , if @xmath286 is a negative even and @xmath289 is occupied by a real root , then , as @xmath140 exceeds @xmath280 , the plateau @xmath245 gets below @xmath290 which therefore becomes triply degenerate : two new holes , one left  moving and special , the other right  moving and normal , appear to the right of the root .",
    "as @xmath140 grows further the root and the left  moving hole `` collide '' and then exchange their positions , the hole now being normal and the root special ; when @xmath140 reaches @xmath291 the root comes back from large negative values of order @xmath128 to finite values , so that @xmath292 increases by one while @xmath293 changes from @xmath294 to @xmath229 and two plateaus are formed , with the left one @xmath295 higher than the other ; then the root passes to the right  moving sea when @xmath140 exceeds @xmath291 and we have once more a unique plateau with height @xmath245 larger than the original one by @xmath296 , in accordance with the fact that @xmath286 has decreased by two units ; next the root `` collides '' with the right  moving hole and exchanges place with it ; at this stage we have a normal left  moving hole , a special right  moving hole and a real root associated to the degenerate quantum number @xmath274 and the two holes disappears as soon as the new @xmath245 gets smaller than @xmath290 , that is when @xmath140 exceeds @xmath297 .",
    "3 and 4 the changing shape of the central portion of @xmath171 is depicted for a special case of the type just discussed .",
    "it is obtained by numerically solving the bae .",
    "another interesting observation concern that case when initially @xmath298 , so that the right sea is a twisted ground state . at the end",

    "we may clarify this matter by performing a simple exercise which backtracks the derivation of the nlie , eq . .",
    "by definition we have , provided @xmath369 @xmath374 which inserted into the derivative of eq . leads to a complete cancelation of the hole contribution ,",
    "so that we obtain @xmath375 but @xmath376 and therefore the last equation is just @xmath348 applied to the derivative of the original definition of the counting function , eq . .",

    "in general we have @xmath377 let us now denote with @xmath378 , @xmath379 , the locations of the special root / holes .",
    "then we also have @xmath380 inserting this into eq",
    ". would not reproduce @xmath348 applied to eq . just because of the last sum over special root / holes .",
    "hence the convolution of @xmath381 with this sum must be subtracted from the source term @xmath382 in eq .",
    "yielding the modification @xmath383 on the hole source . with this simple but crucial change , eq",
    ". holds true in general .",
    "of course it could be recast into the alternative form by analytic continuation and contour deformation .",
    "let us now take care of the integration constant @xmath351 .",
    "one can easily establish that @xmath351 must vanish .",
    "in fact @xmath123 is by definition an asymptotically odd function up to @xmath32 times an integer , that is @xmath384\\to0 $ ] mod @xmath32 as @xmath385 .",
    "thus @xmath386 is asymptotically odd and we need only verify that @xmath387 has the required extra @xmath32 times an integer .",
    "let us also remark that in the limit @xmath18 at fixed @xmath14 we have to leading order @xmath388 .",
    "hence to leading order the distribution of real roots is exponentially peaked around @xmath127 and @xmath128 , with a spreading of order @xmath217 .",
    "this confirm the anticipation made in section [ general ] about the size of the real distribution .",
    "we now observe that the nlie in eqs . and are manifestly analytic in @xmath325 , so that they may be used to define @xmath171 away from the real axis .",
    "this definition may actually differ , for @xmath389 large enough , from the original definition in eq .",
    "due to a different cut structure .",
    "we shall adopt the new definition implied by the nlie : since in the nlie there is only one term of order @xmath90 and is explicitly known , we have a better control on the possible values of the quantum numbers relative to the complex roots .",
    "this redefinition implies that these quantum numbers may be shifted by integers w.r.t . their original definition .",
    "the nlie can be analytically continued away from the real axis in a straightforward manner as long as @xmath390 . for larger values of @xmath391",
    "one must take into account that the first singularity of the kernel @xmath353 can no longer be avoided by deforming the contours @xmath392 .",
    "this is because the real line act as natural boundary for such deformations .",
    "for example @xmath332 can not be deformed through the real line because @xmath393 has modulus larger than one below the real line .",
    "alternatively , one may say that the cuts implied by the poles of the kernel @xmath353 get pinched by the jump discontinuities of the non - analytic function @xmath394 when @xmath391 reaches @xmath395 .",
    "hence the contribution of such singularity has to be explicitly added via the residue theorem , resulting in , for @xmath396 @xmath397 where for any function @xmath398 we have defined @xmath399 notice that the the second determination @xmath400 of the ground ",
    "state contribution to the source @xmath350 identically vanishes in the repulsive regime due to the @xmath401 anti - periodicity of the @xmath402 function .",
    "hence the wide roots do not have a phase space of order @xmath90 in the repulsive regime , in agreement with the discussion in section [ general ] . on the other hand @xmath400",
    "keeps a monotonically increasing term of order @xmath90 in the attractive regime , as required by the interpretation of the wide roots as independent excitations of the attractive regime .",
    "we remark that the expression implies for @xmath171 a cut structure , in the domain @xmath396 , that differs from that of the original definition .",
    "it is also quite interesting to observe that the notion of second determination allows one to write @xmath403 , the complex root contribution to the source of the nlie , in a compact form valid for both regimes : @xmath404 in fact the soliton  soliton two - body scattering phase shift @xmath357 enjoys the fundamental crossing properties : @xmath405 in the repulsive regime @xmath182 and @xmath406 in the attractive regime @xmath183 and    holes , special root / holes and complex roots which specify the source term in the nlie are constrained by the supplementary quantization rules @xmath407 of course the second of these relations is just a repetition of the first in case of special holes . in case of special real roots the locations are in general different from those of the holes , but the corresponding quantum numbers form by construction a subset of those of the holes ( recall in fact that the case of two real roots with the same quantum numbers is not allowed ) .",
    "together with the nlie the above quantization rules provide a framework equivalent to the bae .",
    "the great advantage over the standard algebraic form of the bae is the analytic dependence on @xmath90 , which allows to explicitly perform the continuum limit ( recall that by hypothesis the number of holes and of complex roots stays finite in that limit ) .",
    "more subtle is the question concerning the _ constructive _ nature of the nlie plus supplementary quantization rules , namely whether they completely substitute the original definition and the bae .",
    "our results show that this is indeed so , provided the proper distinction between normal and special root / holes is made : however , this distinction is based on the sign of @xmath124 in certain points , while @xmath123 is itself the unknown in the nlie .",
    "we shall now verify that this is not a loophole , as it might appear at first sight .",
    "in fact , the nlie in or does not admit a solution for arbitrary choices of the source term @xmath350 .",
    "suppose that we take a @xmath350 with an almost flat behavior in a large portion of the real line ( in our case these happens for large @xmath408 ) .",
    "since the convolution with the exponentially peaked kernel @xmath409 acts as a multiple of the identity on constant functions , we see that in the flat regions the nlie reduces to a simple algebraic equation .",
    "in our case we obtain from , for instance as @xmath410 : @xmath411 where @xmath61 , @xmath412 and @xmath413 let us show that eq",
    ". admits a solution if the constant @xmath414 falls in some specific intervals fixed by the ratio @xmath415 . since @xmath416 for a suitable integer @xmath65 ,",
    "then eq . is solved immediately by @xmath66 which is consistent with eq .",
    "provided @xmath417 for @xmath182 , @xmath418 and we see that the sequence of intervals generated by varying @xmath65 does not cover the real line ; if @xmath414 lays in one of the uncovered segments then eq . has no solution .",
    "the special root / holes cure this problem , by preventing @xmath412 to enter into the uncovered segments when @xmath140 and/or @xmath14 vary at fixed quantum numbers .",
    "viceversa , in the attractive regime @xmath183 , we have @xmath419 and there could be several solutions to eq .",
    "that differ by integer multiples of @xmath32 .",
    "this is connected to the fact that in the attractive regime wide roots act as independent excitations that do not affect the phase space for real roots and holes .",
    "having derived the fundamental nlie for a generic ba state , we now turn to the problem of expressing the energy and momentum eigenvalue directly in terms of the function @xmath171 .",
    "the methods are based as before on contour integrals .",
    "the energy and momentum of a ba state may be written , taking eq . into account @xmath420   \\label{eq : ene}\\\\      p\\d & = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\left [ \\phi_{1/2}(\\th-\\l_j )           - \\phi_{1/2}(\\th+\\l_j ) \\right ]       \\label{eq : mom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the choice of logarithmic branch in the energy ensures that the contribution of each real root is negative definite . in this way",
    "one finds that the ba states with holes located at the boundaries of the real distribution carry a large energy of order @xmath421 and decouple in the continuum limit .",
    "hence , as anticipated in sections [ general ] and [ largeth ] , only states with holes well within the real distribution will need to be considered in the continuum limit .    as a preliminary step to relate @xmath11 and @xmath12 directly to the counting function we shall first study the quantity @xmath422 [ as before , we first consider the derivative to avoid worrying with boundary integration constants ] .",
    "the sum over roots in this expression is rewritten as in eq . .",
    "then the sum over real roots and holes may be transformed into a contour integral as done for @xmath171 , and this integral is then manipulated in much the same way to obtain the following result @xmath423 -i\\int_{\\gamma_- }      { { d\\mu}\\o{2\\pi } } \\,g(\\l-\\mu)\\ ,       \\log\\left [ ( -1)^s + e^{-iz_n(\\mu ) } \\right ] \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then use the nlie to eliminate the term linear in @xmath424 and add together , for holes and roots , the two fundamental types of contributions , the direct one already present in eq . and the back  reaction term coming from the nlie .",
    "we obtain , in compact notation and taking correctly into account the eventual special root / holes @xmath425 where , as above , @xmath426 $ ] and @xmath427 while , with the sum still to be performed , @xmath428 when @xmath182 ( repulsive regime ) one finds that the direct and back  reaction terms cancel completely out in the case of wide roots , independently of their location , yielding @xmath429 of course the eventual presence of wide roots would anyway keep affecting @xmath430 through @xmath171 . in the attractive regime @xmath183",

    ". in the continuum limit at fixed @xmath1 both @xmath90 and @xmath14 tend to infinity with the asymptotic relation @xmath441 characteristic of a fixed physical mass for the solitons . in this limit and for any fixed value of @xmath325 the vacuum contribution @xmath442",
    "becomes quite simply @xmath443 .",
    "as natural in the continuum limit , we consider only ba configurations which have the vacuum structure for large rapidities @xmath325 at small enough @xmath140 : there are only real roots and no hole to the far left and right .",
    "therefore , as @xmath140 is raised the first mechanism by which roots get isolated in the tails is exactly that illustrated in section [ general ] : first one special hole is formed simultaneously at both extremities ; then these holes exchange place with the largest and smallest real roots ; finally these tend to infinity and then jump to the lines @xmath271 , respectively . at this stage in each extremity there is a normal holes if @xmath182 or one special hole if @xmath183 .",
    "then , as @xmath140 raises even further , if @xmath182 the normal holes are first pushed to infinity , so that the vacuum structure is reproduced and the mechanism can start over again ; if @xmath182 instead , the mechanism starts over from the point when each special hole is about exchange place with the nearest real root .",
    "thus , for any value of @xmath140 we either have the vacuum structure at each extremity or a symmetric situation such that at each tail we find either a special root / hole or a self  conjugated root plus a normal or special hole .",
    "all these deformations of the vacuum structure are then removed to infinity by the continuum limit @xmath444 and their contribution to the source @xmath350 cancel out by symmetry . moreover , since the special root / holes are formed exactly when @xmath205 jumps by one , one finds that the continuum version of eq . is just @xmath445 where now the @xmath78 special root / holes are in the middle of the distribution , that is for @xmath446 of order @xmath447 .",
    "likewise , the general relation among the numbers of holes , special root / holes complex roots takes now the form @xmath448 we naturally identify @xmath202 with the number of solitons and antisolitons .    having established these simple facts , we may write down the nlie satisfied by the continuum limit @xmath36 of @xmath171 , namely @xmath449 where @xmath37 is related to @xmath450 as @xmath368 to @xmath123 in eq . , that is @xmath451 and @xmath452 is the excitation part of the source .",

    "it is important to observe that the contribution of each wide root coincides with the second determination of the exponential function ( see eq . and notice that the second determination of the exponential vanishes identically in the repulsive regime ) so that we can write for both regimes @xmath460 eqs . and ,",
    "with the supplementary quantization rules entirely determine the excited  states scaling functions of the sg model .",
    "the inputs required are the quantum numbers of the holes , the special root / holes and the complex roots .",
    "notice that the quantum numbers of the complex roots can not in general be chosen arbitrarily , since they are coupled to those of the holes and by the nlie itself .",
    "on the other hand they stay fixed for all values of @xmath439 and may be determined most conveniently in the infrared limit @xmath461 .",
    "this shall be discussed in the next section ; it will become apparent that all quantum numbers associated to particles ( solitons and breathers ) may in practice be freely chosen , while the quantum numbers associated to the configurations of complex roots which describe the internal u(1 ) states of the solitons must be restricted to a limited number of distinct possible values depending on the particle quantum numbers through the higher level bae .",
    "one should then solve the nlie with the locations of holes , special root / holes and complex roots as free parameters , to be fixed later by the supplementary conditions .",
    "the practical feasibility of this is limited to simple enough states , but the existence of a given procedure for any given state ensures that each excited  state scaling function can be determined independently from all other states .",
    "we consider here the limit where the physical size @xmath1 of the system diverges : we then expect the interaction among the physical particles to cease affecting the energy  momentum . hence the quantities @xmath462 and @xmath12 should approach finite limits equal to a free massive spectrum . in fact as @xmath461 it is easy to show that the nonlinear integral terms in eqs . and all vanish exponentially fast . indeed",
    "@xmath463 is peaked around @xmath464 as the exponential of an exponential while @xmath465 dies exponentially for large @xmath466 .",
    "thus the leading form of the counting function is @xmath467 in the infinite volume limit @xmath27 is monotonically increasing since the term @xmath468 dominates . therefore",
    "no special root / holes are present . in the repulsive regime",
    "we then obtain for the excitation energy @xmath469 with an analogous expression for the momentum .",
    "notice that the counting function is certainly monotonic for large @xmath439 , so that @xmath470 and @xmath207 .",
    "another important observation now concerns the close roots @xmath471 s . since @xmath472 for @xmath473 , from eq .",
    "it is clear that the quantization conditions for the close roots , @xmath474=-1 $ ] , require that the @xmath475 s move exponentially fast in @xmath439 to positions where @xmath476 develops the right logarithmic singularities .",
    "it easy to check that in these positions pairs of close roots are separated by @xmath477 so that their contribution cancel out in eq . due to the anti - periodicity of the cosh function .",
    "notice that no such driving exists for wide roots since the second determination @xmath478 vanishes identically when @xmath479 for the same anti - periodicity ( see eqs . and ) .",
    "the fact that the excitation energy and momentum do not depend at all on the complex roots confirms their interpretation of quantum numbers describing the collective internal u(1 ) states of the solitons .",
    "one must notice indeed that the hole rapidities @xmath44 are free parameters at @xmath480 , subject only on the restriction of being distinct .",
    "it appear natural , by continuity , to regard the @xmath481 , the quantum number of the holes , as free distinct half  odd ",
    "integers when @xmath482 is finite .",
    "the situation is more complex in the attractive regime @xmath183 when wide roots explicitly enter the expressions for @xmath73 .",
    "the infrared limit however simplifies the problem , because when @xmath183 the second determination @xmath478 does not vanish anymore , forcing all complex roots , including the wide roots , to fall into special configurations .",
    "these are of two main types . given the positive integer @xmath65 such that @xmath483 and defining @xmath484 , there are arrays of up to @xmath485 roots of the form @xmath486 plus complex conjugates ( we chose @xmath487 here ) .",
    "the array collapses to one with just @xmath488 roots , if @xmath489 , whenever @xmath490 and has , quite trivially , one less root if @xmath491 is self  conjugated , that is @xmath492 .",
    "most importantly , these arrays in any case contain two close roots .",
    "these are the configurations of the first type .",
    "the configurations of the second type _ are made entirely of wide roots and always have fixed imaginary parts _ ; they are odd strings of the form @xmath493 and even strings of the form @xmath494 where @xmath495 .",
    "the fundamental difference between the two types of arrays is in their effect on the counting function and on the total energy ",
    "momentum : the configurations of the first type , which contain close roots , make room for holes ( recall eq . ) but do not affect the @xmath496 energy  momentum , since their contribution to @xmath73 vanishes as can be seen from eq .",

    "these configurations corresponds to the breathers , that is the @xmath500 soliton  antisoliton bound states . on the other hand",
    "the configurations of the first type describe the various polarization states of the soliton ",
    "antisoliton system .",
    "we can now repeat the argument used for the holes in the repulsive regime : in the attractive regime both the hole parameters ( soliton rapidities ) and the locations of second  type configurations ( breather rapidities ) are free in the infinite volume . at finite @xmath439 ,",
    "their quantum numbers are free .",
    "the physical s  matrix describing the scattering of the solitons and their bound states may be calculated directly from eq .",

    "for instance , in a two  hole state with @xmath170 ( no complex roots ) , we would find , dropping the corrections which vanish in the @xmath18 limit , @xmath502 hence @xmath503 is the scattering phase ",
    "shift between two solitons or two antisolitons . the rest of the factorizable two  body s  matrix of the sg model can be reconstructed by considering more general states with two holes and certain complex roots @xcite .    as is well known @xcite ,",
    "hole positions and complex roots for physical states are connected by the higher level ba equations .",
    "this is a finite set of ba - type equations where the holes act as source part and the complex roots appear as ba roots . for a given set of holes ,",
    "they determine all possible states .",
    "the emergence of this higher level ba structure can be seen quite clearly from eq .. in the repulsive regime it suffices to evaluate @xmath36 at the position of each complex root and then sum the result over the two partners of each close pair , to cancel out the imaginary parts proportional to @xmath482 .",
    "there is no need to do this for wide roots , since the second determination @xmath504 of @xmath505 vanishes identically . in the attractive regime things are slightly more complicated : by summing @xmath506 over all the members of an array of the second kind ( which corresponds to a breather ) one finds the quantization rule for the rapidities of the breathers ; by summing @xmath506 over half or over all the members of an array of the first kind , depending on its size , one finds the higher level ba relations between the free parameters of the arrays and the rapidities of the holes .",
    "the exponentially small corrections to the counting function and the energy ",
    "momentum can be calculated by iteration .",
    "the two next  to  leading orders in the case of the ground state were calculated in this way in ref .",
    "for the excited states one has to take into account that the supplementary quantization rules eq .",
    "have to be satisfied to the appropriate order in @xmath507 ( notice that the special configurations of complex roots are valid only to leading order ) .",
    "we shall not dwell further here on this infrared expansion .",
    "when the dimensionless parameter @xmath509 is very small the regions with positive and negative @xmath325 where @xmath510 are very far apart .",
    "we then expect that in a generic case the central portion of @xmath450 broadens to a single plateau , or a two  plateau system , which extends to all @xmath129 s smaller than @xmath511 and then rapidly disappears ( not necessarily in a monotonic fashion ) in favor of the dominant exponential growth .",
    "the two functions @xmath512 describing this crossover determine entirely the leading terms as @xmath513 in the energy  momentum . we shall call @xmath514 `` kink '' functions , although the `` kink '' terminology applies more precisely to the function @xmath37 for strictly positive @xmath371 ( recall eq .",
    "): when @xmath450 changes exponentially fast @xmath37 dies like the negative exponential of an exponential ( it would oscillate exponentially fast for zero @xmath371 ) .",
