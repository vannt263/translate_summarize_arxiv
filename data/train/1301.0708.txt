    "the search for the higgs boson and physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) were among the prime motivations to build the lhc .",
    "with the recent lhc discovery of a new particle with sm - like higgs properties and a mass around @xmath6 125 gev  @xcite , the first mission seems to be accomplished .",
    "the fact that the higgs - like mass value agrees quite well with the range preferred by the analysis of electroweak precision tests ( ewpt )  @xcite , could be seen as a confirmation of the sm .",
    "further studies of the higgs couplings are required in order to confirm its sm nature  @xcite , or to find evidence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "in fact , the lhc has already provided important bounds on the scale of new physics .",
    "however , the failure of the lhc , so far , to find evidence of new particles beyond the sm , has raised some premature concern .    within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is the most popular realization of supersymmetry ( susy ) at the electroweak ( ew ) scale , the lightest higgs boson mass satisfies the tree - level relation @xmath7 @xmath8 , while radiative corrections involving the top / stop system",
    "are needed in order to bring @xmath9 above the lep bound , @xmath10 115 gev .",
    "in fact , to make the mssm light higgs boson to reach a mass of 125 gev , one needs to include stop masses of order tev and/or large values of tan@xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the direct search for squarks and gluinos at the lhc is actually lifting their masses limits to the multi - tev range  @xcite . furthermore , the masses of all the mssm particles must also agree with all bounds from collider and low - energy frontiers , and so far no effect has been detected that would require superpartners with masses below the tev range , with the possible exception of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "these results suggest that susy is actually badly broken , though still softly , and bring into question the original motivation to solve the hierarchy / naturalness problem , as the resulting constraints are difficult to fulfill in the most constrained versions of the mssm , namely for the cmssm or minimal sugra .",
    "several avenues of reasoning have arisen in the susy community to cope with this situation :    1 .",
    "on one side there is the so - called phenomenological mssm ( pmssm )  @xcite , which takes advantage of the large number of parameters that come with the mssm .",
    "then , one looks for regions of the parameter space where the current bounds on higgs and susy are reproduced  @xcite .",
    "this could be seen as a `` no compromise '' model , which will evolve as more data comes from the lhc .",
    "2 .   from a point of view",
    "slightly different , natural susy and its relatives  @xcite offer the possibility of keeping supersymmetry as a solution of the hierarchy problem without re - introducing fine - tuning , which was one of its main phenomenological motivations .",
    "the paradigm of naturalness is actually in tension with the current direct susy bounds but it is still enduring  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we have split susy  @xcite , which falls under the enchantment of the landscape and the fine - tuning sirens .",
    "motivated by the present lack of explanation for the cosmological constant ( @xmath12 ) , one simply assumes that nature accepts a couple of fine - tuning for @xmath12 and the higgs mass .",
    "split susy models have been widely studied lately  @xcite , and assume that , except for the light sm - like higgs boson ( @xmath13 ) , all scalars are in the multi - tev range , while gauginos and higgsinos would have lower masses and could be at the reach of the lhc .",
    "alternative models , inspired in the landscape philosophy of split susy , have been also proposed , such as spread susy  @xcite and high - scale susy  @xcite .    however",
    ", this pattern of heavy sfermions has a positive side , namely the possibility to solve the susy flavor and cp problems by decoupling  @xcite . and this reminds us that there are open problems within the sm , notably the cp and flavor problems , whose solution may also leave its imprints in the parameters of the mssm .",
    "but regarding the susy flavor problem , we notice that the higgs doublets are somehow harmless .",
    "in fact , one could have the full heavy higgs spectrum ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , with masses near the ew scale without any phenomenological conflict  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the approximate degeneracy between the heavy higgs bosons facilitates the agreement with ewpt ; similar conclusion holds for the implications of the yukawa couplings for low - energy flavor observables and collider results  @xcite .",
    "thus , one could imagine other reasons , beyond the landscape and fine - tuning arguments , to have heavy sfermions in the mssm .",
    "for instance , when one considers flavor symmetries , it happens usually that the quarks , leptons and their superpartners , behave differently from the higgs doublets , with the sfermions having flavor quantum numbers , while the higgs doublets are singlets .",
    "consequently , they would have different behavior when the flavor symmetry is broken .    the aim of this paper is precisely to discuss the possible realization of scenarios with higgs masses near the ew scale ( which here it means to be in the range @xmath14 tev ) . in some sense",
    "we shall be studying a type of two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with mssm parameters and additional states , including a dark matter ( dm ) candidate , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which we assume to be the neutralino ( @xmath15 ) , with mssm parameters chosen such that @xmath16 @xmath17(100 gev ) .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we studied the effect of non - universal higgs masses within split - inspired susy scenarios , focusing in heavy higgs decays .",
    "however , after closely examining the defining hypothesis , we have learned now that our proposal goes beyond the split susy models , which are based on the landscape paradigm . in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite , which clarifies the meaning of the fine - tuning associated with split susy , also discussed briefly the possibility to have both higgs doublets near the ew scale .",
    "this requires the imposition of a second fine - tuning , besides the one required to have a light higgs boson at the ew scale .",
    "however , if the fine - tuning is a sign of exceptionality , we feel that using it twice would appear less motivated .",
    "thus , we shall not associate the presence of the full higgs spectrum of the mssm near the ew scale with the philosophy of split susy , but rather as a sign that the mssm is also part of a more fundamental theory , with an unknown sector that communicates susy breaking with the mssm to make the sfermions quite heavy , while it leaves the higgs doublets light enough to be searched at the lhc or future colliders .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ slimsusy ] we present the slim susy scenario and discuss its possible theoretical realizations and its corresponding susy spectra .",
    "section  [ constraints ] is devoted to the study of the constraints that the current higgs mass data and the strength of the sm - like higgs signals observed at the lhc impose over the proposed scenario .",
    "we dedicate section  [ results ] to examine the decays and production of heavy neutral higgs bosons at the lhc in specific scenarios of slim susy .",
    "finally , perspectives and conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the mssm is considered as an attractive model not only because it realizes a new type of symmetry , between bosons and fermions , that helps to solve the hierarchy problem , but also because its building blocks ( r - parity ) allow for the presence of a dm candidate , with the right mass and couplings to generate the measured relic density .",
    "the model is also nice because it predicts gauge coupling unification at a scale that satisfies bounds on proton decay .",
    "the model also contains new sources of cp violation , which may allow to generate the right baryon asymmetry of the universe , while at the same time it should be free of the susy flavor and cp problems .    in order to account for all the above constraints and satisfy all the bounds on higgs and susy at the lhc",
    ", we shall define our slim susy scenario , with the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "it contains heavy sfermions of third generation ( with @xmath18 @xmath17(tev ) ) , to account for the higgs mass value ( @xmath6 125 gev ) .",
    "heavy masses of @xmath17(10@xmath19100 tev ) for the first and second generations of sfermions to solve the susy and cp flavor problems or at least to ameliorate them .",
    "3 .   a neutralino sector with an lsp mass of @xmath17(100 gev ) , which is chosen as the dm candidate  @xcite . other possibilities , such as gravitino dm , could be acceptable too .",
    "the full higgs sector has masses near the ew scale .",
    "the main phenomenological motivation for this scenario is precisely the fact that this spectrum , with the complete mssm higgs sector having masses near the ew scale , has not been considered in detail before , and thus it should be explored at the lhc in order to fully test the possible realization of susy at the ew scale .    in order to provide a general definition of the parameter space of the slim susy scenario",
    ", we assume that all of the soft - masses of squarks and sleptons of the first and second generations are given by only one parameter , @xmath20 .",
    "we also consider only a common soft mass for the third generation of sfermions , @xmath21 , which is defined as the boundary condition for the rges .",
    "therefore , the relevant mssm parameters of slim susy are the following :    * @xmath22 , * 200 gev @xmath23 gev , * 0.1 tev @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 tev , * 1 tev @xmath27 tev , * @xmath28 tev @xmath29 10 tev , * 10 tev @xmath30 100 tev , * 1 tev @xmath31 7.5 tev ,    where @xmath32 is the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath33 is the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs mass , @xmath34 is the common trilinear coupling for the sfermions of the third generation and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the bino , wino , gluino and higgsino masses , respectively .",
    "we notice that the slim susy spectra are somehow similar to the radiative natural susy ones  @xcite .",
    "however , the sfermion sector of the former is much heavier than the latter and it could be even heavier , as lhc searches for susy are indicating , since we do not have to deal with the constraints that naturalness imposes .",
    "moreover , we would like to emphasize that slim susy is not a split susy scenario either , since we do not decouple the heavy scalar states .",
    "although one expects that heavy sfermions would decouple from low energies , there are rge effects that could be important , namely it is possible that @xmath33 acquires imaginary tree - level values ( meaning that the electroweak higgs minimum is essentially unstable ) or the sfermion masses of the third generation may become tachyonic  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we checked that these problems can be avoided if we increase @xmath33 or decrease @xmath21 , and scenarios with values of @xmath21 below 8 tev do not present this kind of difficulty .",
    "however , it would be important to perform a thorough study of the constraints on our scenarios coming from rges and correct ew symmetry breaking , which is out of the scope of this paper , and we leave for future works .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we show next , in figure  [ fig : nevents ] , the expected number of events for these signals at the lhc , calculated as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the production cross section of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( computed with feynhiggs too ) , respectively , and @xmath41 is the total integrated luminosity of the lhc .",
    "we can see from this plot that the most promising process , in order to obtain measurable new physics signals , is the production of @xmath1 via gluon fusion and the consequent decay into two light higgs bosons , with more than @xmath42 expected events for the current @xmath43 23 fb@xmath44 and low values of @xmath33 .",
    "the production of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath2 via gluon fusion and its decay into @xmath45 is also an interesting process , but the number of events expected is lower , @xmath46 at the most for @xmath47 350 gev . both processes are not sufficient to distinguish a 2hdm from slim susy scenarios and we have to resort to the invisible decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the problem in this case is that we need some particles in the final state to be tagged in order to identify the missing transverse energy produced by the two lsp neutralinos .",
    "thus , for the processes with neutralinos in the final state , we consider the production of @xmath1 and @xmath2 associated with a pair of bottom quarks , which have to be tagged @xcite .",
    "the number of events predicted in these latter processes are even much lower , less than 70 for @xmath1 with @xmath33 around 350 gev and close to 200 for @xmath2 with @xmath47 300 gev .",
    "moreover , these numbers will be reduced after @xmath48-tagging process .",
    "nevertheless , the combination of the production of @xmath1 , via gluon fusion , decaying into @xmath49 and the production of @xmath2 , associated with a pair of bottom quarks , decaying into two lsp neutralinos could provide a clear hint of the presented slim susy scenarios .",
    "the recent lhc results on the mass of the new sm - like higgs boson , @xmath6 125 gev , as well as the @xmath17(tev ) direct bounds on the mass of colored superpartners , suggest that a heavy susy scale should be part of the surviving mssm . in this paper",
    "we have proposed an alternative mssm scenario , called slim susy , which has gluinos and sfermions with multi - tev masses .",
    "gluinos and sfermions of third generation have masses of @xmath17(tev ) , in order to account for the higgs mass value ( @xmath6 125 gev ) , while sfermions of the first and second generations are assumed to be heavy enough ( @xmath17(50@xmath19100 tev ) ) to solve the susy and cp flavor problems , or at least to ameliorate them .",
    "the slim susy scenario contains gauginos / higgsinos near the ew scale ; in this regard , it is similar to some mssm scenarios proposed in the literature , such as natural susy , pure gravity mediation , split and spread susy , among others .",
    "however , the scenario includes , as a new feature , the heavy mssm higgs bosons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) near the ew scale too .",
    "in fact , these higgs scalars could be searched at the lhc and provide the first signature of susy at the ew scale , together with a dm candidate . in summary , within our exploration of the possible ways that susy could be realized in nature , we are assuming that no strongly- but only weakly - interacting superpartners will be discovered at the lhc .    we have discussed the theoretical constraints on slim susy and have found regions of parameters where the light higgs boson @xmath13 lays within the mass range [ 122 gev , 128 gev ] , and its couplings satisfy lhc constraints too .",
    "we have also imposed the constraints from lhc higgs searches through the @xmath50 channel for the heavy cp - even higgs boson @xmath1 , finding that most of the points generated satisfy this bound .",
    "then , we have identified distinctive heavy higgs signals that could be searched at the lhc , including the decay modes @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as the invisible decays into the lsp neutralinos @xmath53 .",
    "the mood of the 90 s was to expect that lep would start the detection of the full spectrum of superpartners of the mssm , and the task would be completed at the lhc .",
    "we have learned by now that the possible realization of susy in nature , and its detection at the lhc , will not be as exuberant as it was thought then , but rather slim .",
