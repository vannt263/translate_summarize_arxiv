    "recent studies of ultracold trapped atomic gases have led to the discovery of intriguing physical phenomena and have attracted more and more attentions to the atomic systems .",
    "the trapped atomic gases have some advantages as a physical system in that any combinations of bosons and fermions can be put together on a lattice , microscopic parameters are tunable in most cases , and the systems can be constructed in various geometries , e.g. one - dimensional chain or two - dimensional plane .",
    "one dimensional systems were constructed with bosons @xcite-@xcite and with bosons and fermions @xcite .",
    "these could be the first case that realized one - dimensional boson / boson - fermion systems , and triggered theoretical studies @xcite-@xcite .    at a commensurate filling with the lattice periodicity ,",
    "the mixtures of spinless fermions and bosons in one - dimensional optical lattice were predicted to undergo mott transition at sufficiently large fermion - boson and boson - boson interactions @xcite .    in the boson - fermion mixtures at an incommensurate",
    "filling , on the other hand , the only possible instability is mixing - demixing transition .",
    "when the repulsive interactions between fermions and bosons are small , the two components are well mixed and the system is in the mixing state . when the interactions are large enough , each component stays away from the other and the system is in the demixing state .",
    "cazalilla and ho studied the mixing - demixing transition based on a luttinger liquid formalism with a large difference in the number densities of the two components @xcite .",
    "they derived a criterion for the demixing of hardcore bosons and spinless fermions in the form , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a fermion - boson interaction , @xmath2 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the atomic mass of boson and @xmath5 being the boson density .",
    "also there is a rigorous proof that the system always remains in the mixing state as far as the fermion - boson interaction has the same magnitude as the boson - boson interaction @xcite . for a slightly different but more generalized model , batchelor _ et al .",
    "_ found no demixing phase in the bethe anzatz solution @xcite .    under these circumstances",
    "we need more evidences for the existence of the mixing - demixing transition to draw clear phase diagrams . in this paper",
    ", we investigated numerically the mixing - demixing transitions of incommensurate fermion - boson mixtures to complete the phase diagrams , and identified the roles of various microscopic parameters in the transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in chapt .",
    "2 we will introduce the model hamiltonian and a correlation function we used as an indicator to determine the phases .",
    "chapter 3 is devoted to the description of calculation results and chapt .",
    "4 to the conclusion of the present study .",
    "we consider a mixture of @xmath6 spinless fermions and @xmath7 bosons on an @xmath8-site lattice .",
    "we employed bose - fermi hubbard hamiltonian to describe the interacting particles , which is defined by @xmath9 \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } + \\sum_i \\left [ \\frac{u_{bb}}{2 } n_{b , i}(n_{b , i}-1)+u_{fb}n_{f , i}n_{b , i } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively creation and annihilation operators for fermions ( @xmath12 ) or bosons ( @xmath13 ) on the @xmath14-th site , and @xmath15 . hopping energy and chemical potential",
    "are denoted respectively by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are on - site boson - boson and fermion - boson repulsive interactions respectively .",
    "to observe the mixing - demixing transition , we define a correlation function @xmath20 the first term gives the correlation in neighboring bosons , and the second term expresses the correlation between bosons and fermions on the same and neighboring sites . in the mixing states fermions and bosons",
    "are spatially mixed and move throughout the system , while in the demixing states fermions and bosons reside separately and move in each restricted area . the correlation function @xmath21 changes drastically at the transition , reflecting these characteristics .",
    "it tends to be smaller , or negatively larger , in mixing states than in demixing states .",
    "the reason we omitted @xmath22 from the first term is that this sometimes dominates the correlation function when multiple bosons stay on the same site , mostly in the demixing states , and hides subtle behavior of the other terms .",
    "many physical quantities change at the transition and we actually calculated other various physical quantities including the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "however we found the correlation function @xmath21 exhibited the most drastic change near the transition point and decided to use it as an indicator of the transition .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations with the world - line algorithm @xcite on a one - dimensional @xmath8-site lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we changed in the simulations the number of fermions and bosons , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , while fixing the total number of particles @xmath25 to 14 .",
    "we used the hopping energy @xmath26 of bosons as an energy unit .",
    "temperature was fixed to @xmath27 and the trotter decomposition number @xmath28 to 100 .",
    "the number of sites @xmath8 was set to 30 .    in the following two subsections",
    "we will show the mixing - demixing transitions by changing various parameters with several choices of the difference in the number densities of the fermions and bosons , @xmath29 .      [",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,^ \" , ]     c    the same behavior can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] where the correlation function @xmath30 of the fermions ( a ) and the bosons ( b ) is calculated .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] should be compared with fig .",
    "as @xmath31 increases the transition points shift to the larger @xmath19 side .",
    "we also drew the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] with a larger @xmath31 than used in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) . in comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] with fig .",
    "4(a ) we see the transition area , represented by @xmath32 , clearly shifts to the larger @xmath19 side .",
    "we studied the mixing - demixing transitions of fermion - boson mixtures in one dimension by changing various parameters .",
    "monte carlo calculation showed the mixing - demixing transition occurred at any @xmath33 , the difference in the number densities of the two components , as the repulsive interactions between the fermions and bosons increase . the schematic phase diagram is given in fig .  [ phase ] .",
    "also we confirmed the role of each parameter .",
    "the fermion - boson interaction @xmath19 helps demixing , while the boson - boson interaction @xmath18 and the hopping energy @xmath31 help mixing .",
    "the phase boundary of fig .",
    "[ phase ] therefore shifts to the larger @xmath19 side as @xmath18 or @xmath31 increases .    in our simulations we could not obtain reliable results at large interactions because of the restriction on the computational time .",
    "we performed the simulations for fermions and hardcore bosons , i.e. with @xmath34 , and found no demixing phase as far as @xmath35 .",
    "although we have no numerical evidence on the absence of the demixing phase at @xmath36 , we believe the fermions and the hardcore bosons would not be demixed at any @xmath19 for the following reason .",
    "suppose we have demixed fermions and hardcore bosons with a finite @xmath19 .",
    "in the vicinity of the boundary , the fermions and bosons move around , interacting with each other .",
    "the fermions ( bosons ) can only move to empty sites or sites occupied by the bosons ( fermions ) , which means that it is energetically favored for each component of the particles to invade the area of the other component rather than to stay in its own area .",
    "in other words the demixing state of the fermions and the hardcore bosons would be unstable against mixing .",
    "in fact there is a rigorous proof that a mixture of fermions and bosons remains in the mixing state when @xmath37 @xcite , indicating finite @xmath19 can not demix the mixture of fermions and hardcore bosons .",
