    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to non - contact friction between nanostructures , including , for example , the frictional drag force between two - dimensional quantum wells @xcite , and the friction force between an atomic force microscope tip and a substrate @xcite .    in non - contact friction",
    "the bodies are separated by a potential barrier thick enough to prevent electrons or other particles with a finite rest mass from tunneling across it , but allowing interaction via the long - range electromagnetic field , which is always present in the gap between bodies .",
    "the presence of inhomogeneous tip - sample electric fields is difficult to avoid , even under the best experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "for example , even if both the tip and the sample were metallic single crystals , the tip would still have corners present and more than one crystallographic plane exposed .",
    "the presence of atomic steps , adsorbates , and other defects will also contribute to the inhomogeneous electric field .",
    "the electric field can be easily changed by applying a voltage between the tip and the sample .    the electromagnetic field",
    "can also be created by the fluctuating current density , due to thermal and quantum fluctuations inside the solids .",
    "this fluctuating electromagnetic field is always present close to the surface of any body , and consist partly of traveling waves and partly of evanescent waves which decay exponentially with the distance away from the surface of the body .",
    "the fluctuating electromagnetic field originating from the fluctuating current density inside the bodies gives rise to the well - known long - range attractive van der waals interaction between two bodies @xcite .",
    "if the bodies are in relative motion , the same fluctuating electromagnetic field will give rise to a friction which is frequently named as the van der waals friction .",
    "van der waals friction can be considered as mediated by photon exchange between the bodies : one body emit a photon , and the other absorbs it , thus transferring momentum between the bodies , resulting in a friction force . at large distances between the bodies , the main contribution to friction comes from photon exchange , corresponding to the propagating electromagnetic waves .",
    "however this contribution is very small because the photons corresponding to propagating waves carry very small momentum , no larger than @xmath0 .",
    "the photons , corresponding to the evanescent electromagnetic waves , carry the momentum @xmath1 .",
    "thus for distances @xmath2 between two bodies smaller characteristic distance @xmath3 , which depends on temperature ( at room temperature @xmath4 ) , the main contribution to friction comes from the evanescent electromagnetic field . in analogy with electron tunneling , this mechanism of momentum transfer can be considered as associated with the photon tunneling .",
    "although the dissipation of energy connected with the non - contact friction always is of electromagnetic origin , the detailed mechanism is not totally clear , since there are several different mechanisms of energy dissipation connected with the electromagnetic interaction between bodies .",
    "first , the electromagnetic field from one body will penetrate into the other body , and induce an electric current . in this case friction",
    "is due to ohmic losses inside the bodies .",
    "the fluctuating electromagnetic field can also excite the vibrations of the adsorbates or other surface localized modes , e.g. surface plasmons and polaritons . in this case friction",
    "is due to energy relaxation of the surface modes .",
    "another contribution to friction from the electromagnetic field is associated with the time - dependent stress acting on the surface of the bodies .",
    "this stress can excite acoustic waves , or induce time - dependent deformations which may result in a temperature gradient .",
    "it can also induce motion of defects either in the bulk , or on the surface of the bodies .",
    "the contribution to friction due to non - adiabatic heat flow , or motion of defects , is usually denoted as internal friction .",
    "it is very worthwhile to get a better understanding of different mechanisms of non - contact friction because of it practical importance for ultrasensitive force detection experiments .",
    "this is because the ability to detect small forces is inextricably linked to friction via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "for example , the detection of single spins by magnetic resonance force microscopy , which has been proposed for three - dimensional atomic imaging @xcite and quantum computation @xcite , will require force fluctuations to be reduced to unprecedented levels .",
    "in addition , the search for quantum gravitation effects at short length scale @xcite and future measurements of the dynamical casimir forces @xcite may eventually be limited by non - contact friction effects .",
    "recently gotsmann and fuchs @xcite observed long - range non - contact friction between an aluminum tip and a gold ( 111 ) surface .",
    "the friction force @xmath5 acting on the tip is proportional to the velocity @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "for motion of the tip normal to the surface the friction coefficient @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is the tip - sample spacing and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "later stipe _ _ et.al.__@xcite observed non - contact friction effect between a gold surface and a gold - coated cantilever as a function of tip - sample spacing @xmath2 , the temperature @xmath10 , and the bias voltage @xmath11 . for vibration of the tip parallel to the surface they found @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 at 295for the spacing @xmath15 100they found @xmath16 which is @xmath17500 times smaller that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite at the same distance using a parallel cantilever configuration .    in a recent letter , dorofeev _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite claim that a the non - contact friction effect observed in @xcite is due to ohmic losses mediated by the fluctuating electromagnetic field .",
    "this result is controversial , however , since the van der waals friction has been shown @xcite to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the friction observed by dorofeev _ et.al . _ presently , the origin of the difference in magnitude and distance dependence of the long - range non - contact friction effect observed in @xcite and @xcite is not well understood .    in order to improve the basic understanding of non - contact friction",
    ", we present new results for van der waals friction .",
    "in @xcite we developed a theory of van der waals friction for surfaces in parallel relative motion .",
    "here we generalize the theory to include also the case when the surfaces are in normal relative motion , and we show that there is drastic difference between these two cases .",
    "thus , for normal relative motion of clean good conductor surfaces , the friction is many orders of magnitude larger than for parallel relative motion , but still smaller than observed experimentally .",
    "another enhancement mechanism of the non - contact friction can be connected with resonant photon tunneling between states localized on the different surfaces .",
    "recently it was discovered that resonant photon tunneling between surface plasmon modes give rise to extraordinary enhancement of the optical transmission through sub - wavelength hole arrays @xcite .",
    "the same surface modes enhancement can be expected for van der waals friction if the frequency of these modes is sufficiently low to be excited by thermal radiation . at room temperature",
    "only the modes with frequencies below @xmath18 can be excited . for normal metals surface plasmons",
    "have much too high frequencies ; at thermal frequencies the dielectric function of normal metals becomes nearly purely imaginary , which exclude surface plasmon enhancement of the van der waals friction for good conductors .",
    "however surface plasmons for semiconductors are characterized by much smaller frequencies and damping constants , and they can give an important contribution to van der waals friction .",
    "other surface modes which can be excited by thermal radiation are adsorbate vibrational modes . especially for parallel vibrations",
    "these modes may have very low frequencies .",
    "all information about the long - range electromagnetic interaction between two non - contacting bodies is , in principle , contained in the reflection factors of the electromagnetic field . at present time",
    "very little is known about the reflection factors for large wave vectors and for extremely small frequencies . in the calculations of the reflection factors one must take into account the non - local response of the electron gas on the external electromagnetic field .",
    "there are two correlation length which determine this nonlocal response .",
    "first is the skin depth , which determines the long - range length scale of the nonlocality in the volume , and the second is the screening length .",
    "the latter length scale determines the short range correlation length for non - local response in the surface region . in our previous calculations of the van der waals friction",
    "@xcite we mostly considered good conductors . in this case",
    "it was shown that the important contribution comes from the non - local optic effects in the surface region .",
    "however it was shown that the van der waals friction becomes much larger for high resistivity material , for which the volume contribution from non - local effects is also important .",
    "it is easy to see that within local optic approximation the van der waals friction diverge when the conductivity of materials tend to zero .",
    "this means that the local optic approximation breaks down for high - resistivity materials .",
    "this situation is completely different from the heat transfer between bodies via photon tunneling @xcite , where the heat flux is maximal at conductivities corresponding to semi - metals . in order to clarify the situation we study the dependence of the van der waals friction on the dielectric properties of the materials within the non - local dielectric approach , which was proposed some years ago for the investigation of the anomalous skin effects @xcite .",
    "we consider two semi - infinite metals * 1 * and * 2 * having parallel flat surfaces .",
    "we introduce a coordinate system with @xmath19 plane in the surface of body * 1 * , and the @xmath20 axis along the upward normal .",
    "the surface of body * 2 * is located at @xmath21 , performing small amplitude vibrations along the @xmath22 axes with displacement coordinate @xmath23 since the system is translation invariant in the @xmath24 plane , the electromagnetic field can be represented by the fourier integral @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electric and magnetic induction field , and @xmath28 is the two - dimensional wave vector in @xmath29 plane .",

    "the electric field @xmath31 , and the magnetic induction field @xmath32 , can , to the linear order in the vibrational coordinate , be written in the form @xmath33 @xmath34e^{-ipz}+ [ \\mathbf{k}^{+}\\times\\mathbf{w}_{0}]e^{ipz}\\right )   \\right .",

    "fig.3 shows the dependence of coefficient of friction on the electron density .",

    "close to the poles we can use approximation @xmath266 where @xmath267 is a constant .",
    "then from resonant condition ( [ 5two ] ) we get @xmath268 for the two poles approximation to be valid the difference @xmath269 . from this condition",
    "we get @xmath270 . for the short distances",
    "the parameter @xmath264 defines the value of @xmath265 where the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 5two ] ) ceases to exit .    for @xmath271 and @xmath272 from eq .",
    "( [ 5four ] ) we get @xmath273    for the parallel relative motion using the same approximation we get @xmath274 interesting , the explicit @xmath2 dependence has dropped out of eq .",
    "( [ 5eight ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath275 is still @xmath2 dependent , through the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath264 . for the small distances one can expect that @xmath264 is determined by the dielectric properties of the material and does not depend on @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the friction will be also distance independent . probably , the weak distance dependence observed in @xcite can be explained by the resonant photon tunneling",
    ".    resonant photon tunneling enhancement of the van der waals friction is possible for two semiconductor surfaces which can support low - frequency surface plasmon modes . as an example we consider two clean surfaces of silicon carbide ( sic ) .",
    "the optical properties of this material can be described using an oscillator model @xcite @xmath276 with @xmath277 and @xmath278 the frequency of surface plasmons is determined by condition @xmath279 and from ( [ three ] ) we get @xmath280 . in fig.2",
    "we plot the friction coefficient @xmath281 : note that the friction between the two semiconductor surfaces is several order of magnitude larger than between two clean good conductor surfaces .",
    "another enhancement mechanism is connected with resonant photon tunneling between adsorbate vibrational modes localized on different surfaces . as an example , let us consider ions with charge @xmath282 adsorbed on metal surfaces .",
    "the polarizability for ion vibration normal to the surface is given by @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the frequency of the normal adsorbate vibration , and @xmath285 is the damping constant . in eq .",
    "( [ 3twentyone ] ) the contribution from parallel vibrations is reduced by the small factor @xmath286 .",
    "however , the contribution of parallel vibrations to the van der waals friction can nevertheless be important due to the indirect interaction of parallel adsorbate vibration with the electric field , via the metal conduction electron @xcite .",
    "thus , the small parallel component of the electric field will induce a strong electric current in the metal .",
    "the drag force between the electron flow and adsorbates can induce adsorbate vibrations parallel to the surface .",
    "this gives the polarizability : @xmath287 where @xmath193 is the conduction electron concentration .",
    "as an illustration , in fig.3 we show coefficient of friction for the two cu(001 ) surfaces covered by a low concentration of potassium atoms ( @xmath288 ) . in the @xmath289",
    "integral in eqs.([3eighteen],[3twenty ] ) we used the cut off @xmath290 ( where @xmath291 is the inter - adsorbate distance ) because our microscopic approach is applicable only when the wave length of the electromagnetic field is larger than double average distance between the adsorbates . in comparison ,",
    "the friction between two clean surface at separation @xmath292 is seven order of magnitude smaller . at @xmath292",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath112 for an atomic force microscope tip with @xmath293 is @xmath294 ( @xmath295 , see fig.2 ) ; this is of the same order of magnitude as the observed friction @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the van der waals friction between two flat surfaces for normal relative motion and found a drastic difference in the comparison with parallel relative motion .",
    "this difference is connected with resonance produced by the multiple scattering of the electromagnetic waves from the opposite surfaces . in the case of sharp resonance",
    "it gives much larger contribution to friction in the case of normal relative motion than for parallel relative motion .",
    "we have studied in the detail the friction between two good conductors and have found that for normal relative motion even for very small distances the main contribution to friction comes from the retardation effects .",
    "the non - local optic effects are very important for @xmath36-wave contribution to friction for parallel relative and much less important for normal relative motion . for @xmath37-wave contribution",
    "the non - local optic effects are unimportant for both direction of relative motion .    in the case of van der waals friction",
    "we have found that for distances between bodies @xmath296 ,  for good conductors with a high free electrons concentration , the main contribution to friction is associated with the @xmath37-polarized electromagnetic waves .",
    "for @xmath243  this mechanism gives a friction coefficient per unit area @xmath297kgs@xmath298m@xmath299 nearly independent of the distance @xmath300 while for @xmath245  the friction coefficient @xmath229 depends on distance as @xmath301 for an atomic force microscope tip with the near substrate area @xmath302m@xmath303 we got the friction coefficient @xmath304kgs @xmath298 for @xmath243 .",
    "when the concentration of electrons decreases , the @xmath98contribution to the friction decreases while the @xmath49 contribution increases . at @xmath251   and with the electron lifetime @xmath305s ,",
    "the @xmath49 contribution reaches maximum @xmath306kgs@xmath298m@xmath307 at the electron concentration @xmath308m@xmath309 which corresponds to the conductivity @xmath310(@xmath311m)@xmath312    we have shown that the van der waals friction can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in the case of resonant photon tunneling between low - frequency surface plasmon modes and adsorbate vibrational modes . in the case of friction for two cu(100 ) surfaces covered by a low concentration of potassium atoms at @xmath313 we have found friction of the same order of magnitude as it was observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the distance dependence in this case is more stronger than it was observed in @xcite .",
    "further experiments with simple and well defined composition of the tip and sample must be performed to elucidate different energy dissipation mechanisms in the non - contact friction .",
