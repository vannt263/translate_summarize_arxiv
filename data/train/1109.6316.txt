    ", various targets , such as , measurement of displacement with larger accuracy @xcite and the detection of gravitational waves @xcite are set as milestone achievements .",
    "engineering entanglement in nano - mechanical systems is useful in quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "the possibility of entangling the electromagnetic field with motional degree of freedom of mechanical systems have been explored in various approaches @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a hybrid optomechanical system which consists of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped inside a fabry - perot cavity with a vibrating end mirror ( nano - mechanical resonators ) driven by a single mode optical field .",
    "the intracavity field mediates the interaction of nanomechanical resonator with collective oscillations of the atomic density .",
    "hence , the motional degrees of the nano - mechanical resonator indirectly couples to motional degrees of the freedom of the bose - einstein condensates via optical field inside the cavity .",
    "therefore , intracavity field acts as nonlinear spring between collective atomic density and nano - mechanical resonator .",
    "we show that ( i ) the mechanical vibration of the nanomechanical resonator is entangled to the motional degree of the freedom of the bec in the steady state .",
    "( ii ) furthermore , we analyze the steady - state entanglement as a function of temperature , coupling strength between bec and field , moving mirror and field , and power of input driving laser field . in section 2 ,",

    "we quantify the steady - state entanglement between mechanical resonator and bose - einstein condensate .",
    "later , in section 5 , we explain the possibility to experimentally measure the generating entanglement .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we provide concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a fabry - perot cavity with a moving end mirror driven by a single - mode optical field of frequency @xmath0 , and bec of @xmath1-two level atoms are trapped inside the fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "the condensate atoms placed in the cavity observe one - dimensional optical lattice , formed by the oppositely propagated electromagnetic field inside the cavity .",
    "we consider that the atom - field detuning @xmath2 is very large , spontaneous emission is negligible , and , as a consequence we adiabatically eliminate the internal excited state dynamics of the atoms .",
    "in addition , we also consider that the atomic densities are low enough that one can neglect the two - body interactions . in a weakly interacting regime",
    ", the recent experiment @xcite suggests that only the first two symmetric momentum side modes are excited with momentum @xmath3k , where k is the wave number of the field .",
    "moreover , we assume that the vibrating end mirror of the optical cavity of length @xmath4 is performing harmonic oscillations with frequency @xmath5 along the cavity axis ( x - axis ) .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the hamiltonian of the hybrid optomechanical system formed by the bec , the intracavity field , and the vibrating end mirror of the cavity ( nanomechanical resonator ) in the rotating frame at the laser frequency @xmath6 is given by @xcite @xmath7 where , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . here",

    "we assume that the frequency of the nanomechanical resonator is less than the free spectral range , ( _ i.e _ , @xmath24 ( v is the speed of light ) .",
    "therefore , scattering of photons into others modes , except the driven mode , is neglected @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath25 accounts for the interaction between nano - mechanical resonator and intracavity field and is given by @xmath26 here , the coupling strength between nano - mechanical resonator and light radiation pressure is defined by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the zero - point motion of the mechanical mode of mass @xmath29 . moreover ,",
    "the interaction of the bec with intracavity mode is described by the hamiltonian @xmath30 given by @xmath31 where , @xmath32 is described the strength of interaction between bec mode and intracavity field .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in order to describe the complete dynamics of the system we include the dissipation effects .",
    "in addition to the dynamics described by the hamiltonian in eq.([ham ] ) , the system is exposed to the random noise forces due to quantum fluctuations of the radiation field and fluctuation of the phononic heat bath associated to the mechanical resonator .",
    "we neglect the thermal effects of the atomic cloud and assume that the vacuum noise associated with the cavity field is markovian in nature with decay rate @xmath18 and noise operator @xmath33 of the input field which obeys the following correlation functions , @xmath34 here , @xmath35^{-1}$ ] is the equilibrium occupation number of the optical oscillator . for optical frequency",

    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the motion of the nano - mechanical resonator is affected due to thermal bath is brownian and non - morkovian in nature @xcite .",
    "the quantum effects on mechanical resonator are only observed in the limit of very high mechanical quality factor @xmath39 , the brownian noise operator can be modeled as markovian with the decay rate of the mechanical mode is @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the noise operator @xmath41 can be characterized as @xmath42 where , @xmath43^{-1}$ ] is the equilibrium thermal occupation number of the mechanical resonator .",
    "in order to describe the complete dynamics of the subsystems involved in this problem , an adequate choice is to use the formalism of the quantum langevin equations .",
    "therefore , the heisenberg - langevin equation of motion for the intracavity mode , mechanical mode and bosonic field operator can be written as @xmath44 where _ dot _ denotes the time derivatives and for simplicity we omit the _ hat _ symbol from the operators .",
    "these are the nonlinear quantum langevin equations and dynamics is complicated . in the following we linearized the operators around the steady state values , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . here",

    "we rewrite each heisenberg operator in eq.([langeq ] ) as a sum of steady state value and fluctuation operator with zero mean value .",
    "therefore , the linear set of equations are , @xmath55 the linearized quantum langevin equations show that the fluctuations of mechanical resonator and bec are now coupled to the cavity field quadrature fluctuations by the effective couplings @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which can be made very large by increasing the amplitude @xmath58 of the intracavity field .",

    "furthermore , @xmath65 is the vector corresponding to noises , whereas @xmath66 is drift matrix .",
    "since the quantum noises are white in nature and the dynamics is linearized , hence the state of the system will be a zero mean gaussian state , and therefore completely determined by the covariance matrix @xmath67 . in order to find the steady state covariance matrix @xmath68 , we solve the linearized quantum langevin equations as did in @xcite .",
    "in steady state the covariance matrix fulfills the lyapunove equation @xmath69 eq.([lymp ] ) is the linear matrix equation and can straight forwardly be solved .",

    "one can easily observe that @xmath70 exists only within a finite interval of values of the @xmath102 around @xmath103 .",
    "now , we investigate the effects of temperature on the entanglement .",
    "we consider @xmath70 of the evolved system at a fixed value of detuning . at high temperature ,",

    "the effective interaction between a mechanical resonator and bose - einstein condensate can be described via the hamiltonian @xmath116 , from eq.([eff ] ) @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the effective coupling strength between mechanical mode and bec .",
    "this hamiltonian is analogous to the interaction of two optical fields in a nonlinear medium generating the 2-modes squeezed state @xcite . the first term in eq.([squeez ] )",
    "corresponds to an energy exchange take place between mechanical and atomic modes . the second term in eq.([squeez ] ) accounts for the down - conversion interaction , describes the creation and annihilation of the atomic and mechanical modes phonons in pairs , which corresponds to entangling the atomic and mechanical modes .",
    "for @xmath119 or greater , the mechanical resonator and bose - einstein condensate are entangled , and the parameters are chosen such that this condition is fulfilled .",
    "for experimental realization of the generated entanglement , one has to measure several quadrature correlations @xcite as have been experimentally measured for the entanglement of the two optical modes @xcite . however , in our case we consider another fabry perot cavity adjacent to first one and is driven by a weak laser field , a scheme of this kind has been discussed in @xcite . in addition , we assume that the movable mirror is perfect reflector at both sides so there is entanglement between the optical modes of the two cavities .",
    "the equation of motion of the annihilation operator @xmath120 of the optical mode of the second cavity similar to the linearized version of eq.([linrz ] ) is @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the cavity decay rate , effective detuning and the input noise of the second cavity mode respectively .",
