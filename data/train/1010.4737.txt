    "supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) are promising candidates for new physics at the tev scale @xcite as the solve several short - comings of the standard model ( sm ) . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) solves the hierarchy problem of the sm @xcite , leads to a unification of the gauge couplings @xcite and introduces several candidates for dark matter depending on how susy is broken @xcite .",
    "its phenomenology with respect to present and future colliders has been widely explored , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , similarly as the sm it needs additional ingredients to explain neutrino data , e.g.  by either incooperating heavy new particles giving rise to tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism @xcite or via the braking of r - parity @xcite .",
    "moreover , a new problem arises in the mssm not present in the sm : the superpotential contains a parameter with dimension mass , namely the so called @xmath0 parameter which gives masses to the higgs bosons and higgsinos . from a purely theoretical point of view",
    ", the value of this parameter is expected to be either of the order of the gut / planck scale or exactly zero , if it is protected by a symmetry . for phenomenological aspects ,",
    "however , it has to be of the order of the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and it has to be non - zero to be consistent with experimental data .",
    "this discrepancy is the so called @xmath0-problem of the mssm @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss various supersymmetric models addressing at least one of these two topics focusing on features of their phenomenology which can be tested at the lhc and which differ from the usual mssm phenomenology .",
    "we will take as main guideline the requirement that neutrino data are correctly explained .",
    "we will first discuss briefly the case of dirac neutrinos and afterwards discuss models leading to majorana neutrinos , both in the context of conserved r - parity . in the third part",
    "we cover models with broken r - parity and their phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "technically the easiest way to obtain masses for neutrinos is by introducing a new yukawa coupling similar to the ones for the sm fermions . in this case",
    "the mssm has to be extended by additional right handed neutrinos , which are gauge singlets with respect to the sm gauge group , and the superpotential of the mssm @xmath1 has to be extended by the term @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mssm superfields containing the higgs bosons , quarks , leptons and their supersymmetric partners . in addition the superfield @xmath10 for the right - handed neutrino and the right - sneutrino has been introduced .",
    "the corresponding yukawa coupling @xmath11 has to be tiny , of the order @xmath12 and smaller , to explain correctly neutrino masses in the sub - ev range as required by data @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that one is essentially left with the usual mssm phenomenology , except for the case where the right - sneutrino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) : in this case all decays are as in the mssm down to the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) which eventually decays into the lsp .",
    "the corresponding width of the last step is proportional to @xmath13 and thus rather small implying at the lhc decay lengths ranging from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "consequently the signal of such a scenario is very two long - lived particles in each event which can even appear as stable particles in a typical detector of high energy collider experiments .",
    "detailed studies have been performed for the cases of a stau @xcite nlsp and a stop @xcite nlsp demonstrating that lhc should be able to identity such scenarios .",
    "a possibility to obtain tiny neutrino masses while having at the same time sizable yukawa couplings are seesaw scenarios where very heavy new particles are postulated inducing the so - called weinberg operator @xcite @xmath16 when integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom . here",
    "@xmath17 is a measure of the scale for these new particles and @xmath18 is usually a combination of different yukawa couplings .",
    "one can show , that at tree - level only three possibilities exist to realize such scenarios @xcite .",
    "type - i is the well - known case of the exchange of a heavy fermionic singlet usually denoted @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "type - ii corresponds to the exchange of a scalar @xmath20 triplet @xcite . in seesaw",
    "type - iii one adds ( at least two ) fermionic @xmath20 triplets to the field content of the sm @xcite . in the last two models particles charged under the sm gauge group",
    "are added and which correspond to incomplete @xmath21 representations .",
    "as they would destroy the nice feature of gauge coupling unification one often adds at the seesaw scale(s ) additional particles to obtain complete @xmath21 representations to maintain the feature of gauge coupling unification .",
    "a detailed discussion including the embedding in @xmath21 models can be found in e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "below we present only the various superpotential for briefness .",
    "in addition there will also be the corresponding soft susy terms which , however , reduce at the electroweak scale to the mssm ones once the states with masses at the seesaw scale(s ) are integrated out and , thus , are not discussed further .",
    "these additional terms only contribute to threshold corrections at the seesaw scale(s ) and their effect is negligible if one requires universal boundary conditions for all soft terms @xcite",
    ". here we will assume common soft susy breaking at the gut - scale @xmath22 to specify the spectrum at the electroweak scale : a common gaugino mass @xmath23 , a common scalar mass @xmath24 and the trilinear coupling @xmath25 which gets multiplied by the corresponding yukawa couplings to obtain the trilinear couplings in the soft susy breaking lagrangian .",
    "in addition the sign of the @xmath0 parameter is fixed as well as @xmath26 at the electroweak scale where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral component of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .      in this class of models",
    "one postulates very heavy right - handed neutrinos yielding the following superpotential below the gut - scale : @xmath31 for the neutrino mass matrix one obtains the well - known formula @xmath32 being complex symmetric , the light majorana neutrino mass matrix in eq .",

    "we assume @xmath41 implying that @xmath36 contains only `` diagonal '' products @xmath42",
    ".      in seesaw models of type ii one adds a scalar @xmath20 triplet @xmath43 to generate neutrino masses .",
    "as this triplet carries also hypercharge one has to embed it in a @xmath44-plet of @xmath21 which has under @xmath45 the following decomposition @xcite @xmath46 in supersymmetric models one adds a pair @xmath44 and @xmath47 to avoid anomalies below the gut - scale .",
    "below the gut scale in the @xmath21-broken phase the superpotential reads @xmath48 where the states with index 1 ( 2 ) belong the @xmath44-plet ( @xmath47-plet ) . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : broken ] ) is responsible for the generation of the neutrino masses yielding @xmath49 note that @xmath50 i.e. @xmath51 is diagonalized by the same matrix as @xmath52 .",

    "having a gut model in mind we require for the numerical discussion later the @xmath21 boundary conditions @xmath55 at the gut scale .",
    "as long as @xmath56 gauge coupling unification will be maintained .",
    "the equality need not be exact for a successful unification . in our numerical studies",
    "we have taken into account the different running of these mass parameters but we decouple them all at the scale @xmath57 because the differences are small .      in the case of a seesaw",
    "model type iii one needs new fermions @xmath58 at the high scale being in the adjoint representation of @xmath20 .",
    "they have to be embedded in a @xmath59-plet to obtain a complete @xmath21 representation which decomposes under @xmath60 as @xmath61 the fermionic components of @xmath62 and @xmath63 have exactly the same quantum numbers as @xmath64 and @xmath58 .",

    "the appearance of charged particles at scales between the electroweak scale and the gut scale leads to changes in the beta functions of the gauge couplings @xcite . in the mssm",
    "the corresponding values at 1-loop level are @xmath74 . in case of one @xmath44-plet",
    "the additional contribution is @xmath75 whereas in case of @xmath59-plet it is @xmath76 .",
    "this results in case of type ii in a total shift of @xmath77 for the minimal model and in case of type iii in @xmath78 assuming 3 generations of @xmath59-plets .",

    "is realized , one gets new interesting signatures . for example there exists light stau lsp scenarios where @xmath183 decays dominantly via 4-body decays such as @xmath184 with long lifetimes leading to displaced vertices @xcite .",
    "another interesting signals are the resonant production of sleptons as discussed in @xcite or associated production of single sleptons with @xmath185-quarks @xcite .    an interesting question is to which extent one can measure deviations from the hierarchical structure above , e.g.  the coupling @xmath186 can still be of order @xmath187 . it has been shown in @xcite that in such a case one lhc will be able to measure such couplings of such a strength with an accuracy of about 10% .",
    "we have discussed aspects of various extensions of the mssm taking the explanation of neutrino data as guide - line . as a first model",
    "the case has been considered where one adds a dirac mass term for the neutrinos with tiny yukawa couplings . in this case one obtains the usual mssm phenomenology except for the case where the right - sneutrino is the lsp because in this case the nlsp will be very long - lived and one gets as signature quasi - stable particles at the lhc .    in case of seesaw models",
    "one finds that in case of type ii and type iii models the spectrum can be quite different when compared to the usual msugra scenarios as a consequence of additional charged particles between the seesaw scale(s ) and the gut scale .",
    "these differences are the larger the lower the seesaw scale and affect in particular the masses of the sfermions .",
    "one can study four ratios at the lhc which can give information on the gut scale if one assumes universal boundary conditions for the soft susy breaking parameters at the gut scale .",
    "moreover , there are parameter regions in all seesaw models where lepton flavour violating signals can be found in susy cascade decays .",
    "however , for this in general a rather high luminosity in the order of 100 @xmath188 or higher is required .",
    "supersymmetric models also offer the possibility to explain neutrino data via r - parity violation . here",
    "we have mainly focused on models where r - parity is broken by bilinear terms as this is sufficient to explain neutrino data and to explore the relevant lhc phenomenology . moreover",
    ", this class of models can be obtained as effective model in case of spontaneous r - parity breaking .",
    "bilinear r - parity breaking implies correlations between neutrino data and decays properties of the lsp , e.g.  in case of an neutralino lsp the ratio @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the mixing angle related to the the atmospheric neutrino sector .",
    "in addition one finds very often that the lsp life time is sufficiently small to produce a displaced vertex in a typical collider experiments .",
    "this work has been supported by the dfg , project number po-1337/1 - 1 , the alexander von humboldt foundation and the spanish grant fpa2008 - 00319/fpa .",
