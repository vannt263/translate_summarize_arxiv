    "in 2014 , the belle collaboration released new experimental data of the cross section of @xmath1 @xcite , where two charmonium - like states @xmath2 and @xmath3 were confirmed again . besides @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the experimental data of the cross section for @xmath1 @xcite show the existence of an extra narrow structure near 4.2 gev , which inspires our interest in exploring its origin .    since this peak is just located at the invariant mass of @xmath10 from the @xmath11 annihilation @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that it must have the @xmath12 quantum number .",
    "this fact leads us to an important issue to be checked , whether this structure around 4.2 gev in the invariant mass of @xmath10 has a relation with the proposal of a missing @xmath0 in our two recent papers @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we once predicted a missing higher charmonium @xmath0 with the mass 4263 mev when applying the similarity between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 families , which is supported by former theoretical calculation of the charmonium spectrum by considering the screened potential @xcite . further study of the open - charm decay channels of @xmath0 indicates that @xmath0 has very narrow decay width @xcite , which is the reason why @xmath0 is still missing in the present experimental data .",
    "besiii reported the measurement of the cross section for @xmath15 at @xmath16 gev @xcite .",
    "yuan performed a fit of the available experimental data of @xmath15 from 3.90 to 4.42 gev , and found a narrow structure around 4.2 gev , where the mass and width are reported to be @xmath17 mev and @xmath18 mev or @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev @xcite , depending on the different assumptions of the line shape trend above 4.42 gev .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite attributed this narrow structure existing in @xmath15 to the predicted missing @xmath0 .",
    "later , the present authors noticed new results of @xmath21 given by besiii @xcite , and indicated that this observed resonance structure with mass @xmath22 mev and width @xmath23 mev in @xmath21 @xcite can be explained as the predicted @xmath0 @xcite since the calculated branching ratio of @xmath24 can overlap with the experimental data in a reasonable parameter range .",
    "in addition , the upper limit of a branching ratio of @xmath25 is also predicted to be @xmath26 , which can be further tested by besiii , belle and the forthcoming belleii was extracted by analyzing the experimental data , which is consistent with our theoretical prediction in ref .",
    "] .    besides @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite , we have been trying to search for any signal of the predicted @xmath0 in other hidden - charm decay channels from the @xmath27 annihilation .",
    "the new experimental data of @xmath1 @xcite provides us good opportunity . in this work ,",
    "we first fit the observed cross section for @xmath1 by including three resonance contributions , i.e. , those of the predicted @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this way",
    ", we extract the resonance parameters of these three resonances . comparing the obtained resonance parameters of @xmath0 with the theoretical results",
    ", we can further test the @xmath0 assignment to this structure around 4.2 gev in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath10 .",
    "after fitting the experimental data of @xmath1 @xcite , we next obtain information of the branching ratio of @xmath28 . in this work",
    ", we also calculate the branching ratios of @xmath28 and make a comparison with the extracted data , which can provide an extra test of the proposal in the present work .",
    "the detailed calculation will be given in the next section .    since",
    "enough experimental data have been accumulated for the hidden - charm decay channels from the @xmath11 annihilation , i.e. , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , and @xmath1 @xcite , we are able to perform a combined analysis of all these data assuming the existence of @xmath0 around 4.2 gev .",
    "this is also the main issue in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section , a detailed analysis of fitting the @xmath1 data",
    "is presented on the premise that the predicted @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are present .",

    "[ fig : sch2-psi2s ] .",

    "[ fig : sch2-hc ] .",

    "the ratio @xmath65 has a large error and is compatible with zero .",
    "the large error dominantly comes from the error of the branching ratio of @xmath66 . as for the ratio @xmath67",
    ", it is fitted to be @xmath68 , which is consistent with the expectation of heavy quark effective theory when taking @xmath33 as @xmath0 .",
    "being stimulated by the anomalous mass gaps of the @xmath69-wave charmonia and the similarity between the charmonium and bottomonium families , we have predicted a missing @xmath69-wave vector charmonium state , @xmath0 , located near @xmath32 gev in ref .",
    "theoretical estimates based on the quark pair creation model indicate that this predicted @xmath0 is a narrow state @xcite .",
    "since on the experimental side a narrow structure near 4.2 gev has been observed in the @xmath47 @xcite and @xmath48 processes @xcite , we have attributed the structure in both processes to the missing @xmath0 .",
    "the search for the signal of @xmath0 in other channels is an intriguing and urgent problem .",
    "recently , more precise experimental measurements of the cross section for @xmath31 have been performed by the belle collaboration @xcite . since other than the structures of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , a number of bump events near 4.2 gev have been found in the same cross section , in this paper we have performed a fit to the cross section with three resonances to find one additional resonance , @xmath33 , with @xmath4 mev and @xmath5 mev .",
    "the resonance parameters of the @xmath33 are consistent with our expectation for the missing @xmath0 .",
    "the upper limit of the product @xmath70 is fitted to be @xmath71 ev . with the assumption of @xmath33 as the @xmath0 and the theoretical estimate of @xmath72 in a screening potential model ,",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath29 is evaluated to be @xmath73 .",
    "one should notice that this mass of the @xmath0 is above the threshold of a charmed or charmed - strange meson pair , which indicates that the dominant decay modes of @xmath0 are open - charm decays .",
    "as for the hidden charm decay processes , like @xmath29 and @xmath7 , they can occur via charmed or charm - stranged meson loops .",
    "we have calculated the meson loop contributions to the decay @xmath29 to find that the branching ratio resulting from the meson loops is dependent on the parameters involved in calculations , but the branching ratio from our fit to the cross section for @xmath31 is understandable in a reasonable parameter range , which also indicates that the @xmath33 observed in the @xmath31 process could be a good candidate of the @xmath0 .    to further test our conjecture that the structures near 4.2 gev in @xmath74 , @xmath31 , and @xmath48 come from the same source , i.e. , @xmath0",
    ", we have performed a combined fit to these three hidden charm production processes in two different schemes .",
    "the mass and width of @xmath0 are fitting to be @xmath75 mev , @xmath76 mev and @xmath77 mev , @xmath78 mev for scheme i and scheme ii , respectively , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi4s2 ] ) and ( [ eq : psi4s3 ] ) . besides the resonance parameters of @xmath0 , the products of the branching ratios of @xmath79 and the dilepton decay width of the @xmath0 are also determined by fitting the experimental data",
    ". the ratios of the branching ratios for the hidden dipion decay to the @xmath7 decay mode are also estimated , which can be tested by further experimental measurements at besiii and the forthcoming belleii .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the precise experimental measurements of the hidden - charm decay have provided some evidences of the existence of the missing @xmath0 at the present moment .",
    "the future measurement for the hidden - charm decay will be able to further test our estimate of resonance parameters of @xmath0 , in particular , the measurements of the cross section for @xmath47 above 4.4 gev can provide a further restriction on the properties of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the precise measurements for the open - charm decay mode are also crucial for the properties of the missing @xmath0 .",
