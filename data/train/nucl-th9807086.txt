    "over the past years intense efforts have been made to better understand the properties of nuclear systems under extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that basic properties of hadrons undergo severe modifications in nuclear medium we expect that at sufficiently large densities chiral symmetry is restored . moreover , we know that already at nuclear saturation density we should find strong medium effects .",
    "for instance the quark condensate @xmath2 is estimated to drop to about 70% of its vacuum value at the nuclear saturation density , as follows from the model - independent prediction of refs .",
    "the change in this basic scale of strong interactions , as well as other matter - induced effects , undoubtedly lead to severe modifications of in - medium hadron properties , whose excitation energies , widths , coupling constants , size parameters , _ etc . _ undergo changes .",
    "the experimental evidence for these effects can be found in studies of mesonic atoms , or in the measurements of dilepton spectra in heavy ",
    "ion collisions in the ceres @xcite and helios @xcite experiments at cern . much more accurate data on hot and dense matter will be provided by the hades experiment , and by rhic in the near future .",
    "it is therefore an important task to better understand and describe theoretically _ mesonic excitations _ in dense and hot systems .",
    "recent years have brought new interesting ideas and developments in this field .",
    "the incomplete list , relevant for the subject of this paper , contains the possibility of s - wave kaon condensation in nuclear matter @xcite , and the application of chiral effective lagrangians and models to nuclear systems .",
    "general model - independent predictions for excitations with quantum numbers of the pion , based on chiral charge algebra , were made in refs . @xcite .",
    "our present work summarizes and further extends the results presented there .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : in the first part we review the previously - derived current - algebraic sum rules for pionic excitations in nuclear medium ( the generalization of the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation @xcite , the sum rule of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as derive new sum rules concerning the excitations with quantum numbers of the @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 meson ( @xmath5 ) ( sec .",
    "[ sec : current ] ) .",
    "we discuss formal predictions following from these sum rules ( sec .",
    "[ sec : formal ] ) .",
    "particular attention is drawn to nuclear matter with isospin asymmetry , since this is the case where nontrivial conclusions can be drawn for the behavior of mesonic excitations in the limit of vanishing current quark masses .",
    "we discuss the appearance of very soft modes in this limit . in the pion channel there",
    "exists a positive - charge mode ( for medium of negative isospin density ) whose excitation energy scales in the chiral limit as the current quark mass itself , and the the square root of it , as is the case of the vacuum . in the @xmath3 channel there exists a positive - charge mode ( for medium of negative isospin density ) whose excitation energy scales as the difference of the current masses of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks .",
    "these modes are shown to completely saturate the sum rules in the limit of vanishing current quark masses .    in the second part of the paper ( sec .",
    "[ sec : njl]-[sec : asymm ] ) we present an extensive illustration of the general results with help of quark matter in the nambu - jona  lasinio model @xcite .",
    "although quark matter is not a realistic approximation to nuclear matter ( except , perhaps , at very large densities ) , the model is good for the present purpose .",
    "the reason is that the nambu - jona - lasinio model is consistent with chiral symmetry and complies to chiral charge algebra relations leading to the sum rules .",
    "we show that the results of the model are highly nontrivial : collective states appear in isospin - asymmetric medium ( spin - isospin sound modes ) and these states are necessary to saturate the sum rules . for certain choice of model parameters ,",
    "these sound modes become the very soft modes in the limit of vanishing current quark masses , and they completely saturate the sum rules .",
    "finally , we remark that the nambu  jona - lasinio model is interesting in its own , and that much of the expectations concerning the behavior of mesons in medium have been based on calculations carried out in this model .",
    "in this section we present a set of sum rules that are going to be explored in this paper .",
    "the method follows refs .",
    "the sum rules follow from the @xmath8 chiral charge algebra @xcite of qcd and involve no extra assumptions , therefore are very general . in the context of effective chiral models",
    "such relations were derived in refs .",

    "sum rule ( [ gmor0r ] ) becomes @xmath71 as long as the chiral symmetry is broken , @xmath72 is non - zero in the chiral limit @xmath73 .",
    "as already mentioned , the vacuum subtraction terms are of order @xmath74 , thus are chirally small .",
    "therefore , to match the chiral dimensions on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ simgmor ] ) , there must exist a state , denoted as @xmath59 , for which @xmath75 . since the matrix element @xmath76 is finite in the chiral limit , then it follows that @xmath77 .",

    "we have @xmath79 note that this result is true for any baryon density .    in principle ,",
    "in the dense medium there could be more than one state contributing to the sum rule ( [ simgmor ] ) in the chiral limit .",
    "it is known that many - body effects of the fermi sea can induce additional branches of excitations , and we could have several states scaling as ( [ isoscal ] ) . whether or not this occurs is a complicated dynamical issue . the formal result states that there exists at least one state scaling as ( [ isoscal ] ) in the chiral limit .      as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in medium with finite isovector density , @xmath80 , the behavior of charged excitations in the chiral limit is radically different from the isosymmetric case ( [ isoscal ] ) .",
    "first , an obvious remark is that since the medium state @xmath28 breaks the isospin invariance , the isospin symmetry of excitations is broken .",
    "in fact , at low densities @xcite one can relate the splitting of @xmath81 and @xmath82 to the weinberg - tomosawa term in the @xmath53-@xmath83 scattering , and obtain @xmath84 in this approach one takes the low - density limit _  prior _ to the chiral limit .",
    "( [ wt ] ) shows that for negative @xmath30 at small densities we have @xmath85 .",
    "however , eq . ( [ wt ] ) can not be used at large densities .",
    "now , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the isospin density is fixed , and employ sum rules ( [ gmor1r]-[vec1r ] ) . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath86 , as in the case of neutron stars or large nuclei .",
    "since @xmath30 is an external property of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ independent of the chiral parameter , it is treated as large ( finite ) in the chiral limit .",
    "then , also the _ isovector chemical potential _",
    ", @xmath87 , defined as the minimum energy needed to lower the isospin by one unit , is finite in the chiral limit .- exchange model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when an object of isospin @xmath88 is placed in the isospin - asymmetric medium , the energy gain is equal to @xmath89 @xmath90 , and the corresponding chemical potential is @xmath91 , where the last equality follows from the ksfr  relation .",
    "this shows that finite @xmath30 in the chiral limit implies finite @xmath87 .",
    "another example is provided by the fermi - gas model discussed in this paper .",
    "the expression for the chemical potential is ( see sec . [",

    "hence , for the medium with @xmath97 , or @xmath98 , only the positive - isospin excitation energies can vanish .",
    "the negative - isospin excitation energies can not vanish , including the case of the chiral limit .",
    "hence we arrive at the result that for @xmath86 the negative - charge excitations are chirally large , @xmath99 since the matrix elements @xmath100 are non - singular in the chiral limit , the sum over negative - isospin excitations , @xmath101 , in eqs .",

    "one gets @xcite @xmath118 note that these inequalities are nontrivial , since in the vacuum the corresponding power is @xmath119 .    carrying a similar analysis for the neutral pionic excitation in isospin - asymmetric medium",
    "we find that in the chiral limit it scales the usual way according to eq .",
    "( [ isoscal ] ) , _ i.e. _ as in the isosymmetric case .",
    "this is clear , since the medium does not break the third component of isospin .",
    "we conclude this section with several comments .",
    "firstly , the behavior of charged pionic modes in the chiral limit is radically different when the medium breaks the isospin symmetry . for @xmath86",
    "the negative - charge excitation has finite energy in the chiral limit , eq .",
    "( [ neg ] ) , and the positive - charge excitation becomes very soft , with excitation energy scaling as eq .",
    "( [ eplus ] ) ( if there is a single mode contributing in the chiral limit ) or according to eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) ( if there are more modes ) .",
    "furthermore , as we will show in the model calculation in the following sections , the nature of this soft mode can be quite complicated : it need not be the excitation branch connected to the pion in the vacuum , but the spin - isospin sound mode , resulting from collective effects in the fermi sea .",
    "now we pass to the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ addr]-[vec2r ] ) in the isovector limit @xmath66 . to our knowledge ,",
    "results of this section are novel .",
    "the method is the same as in the previous sections , with the obvious difference that now we compare the powers of @xmath120 rather than @xmath107 on both sides of the sum rules ( [ addr]-[vec2r ] ) .    in isosymmetric medium @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the powers of @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ addr ] ) are matched with @xmath123 this result is not surprising : since @xmath3 is not a goldstone boson , there is no reason for its mass to vanish in the vacuum , or in isosymmetric medium .    in asymmetric medium",
