    "the photonic band structures of composite materials have been studied extensively .",
    "such band structures are defined by the relation between frequency @xmath2 and bloch vector @xmath3 in media in which the dielectric constant is a periodic function of position .",
    "a major reason for such interest is the possibility of producing photonic band gaps , i.e. , frequency regions , extending through all @xmath3-space , where electromagnetic waves can not propagate through the medium .",
    "such media have many potentially valuable applications , including possible use as filters and in films with rejection - wavelength tuning.@xcite in systems with a complete photonic band gap , the spontaneous emission of atoms with level splitting within the gap can be strongly suppressed.@xcite    since light can not travel through the photonic band gap materials ( bragg diffracted backwards ) , one of their applications can be a complete control over wasteful spontaneous emission in unwanted directions when a device , such as a laser , is embedded inside a 3d photonic crystal.@xcite 2d photonic crystals can be used as optical microcavities , microresonators,@xcite waveguides,@xcite lasers , @xcite or fibers@xcite while 1d photonic crystals can be used as bragg gratings or optical switches.@xcite    the photonic band structure of a range of materials has been studied using a plane wave expansion method .",
    "typically , the method converges easily when the dielectric function is everywhere real , but more slowly , or not at all , when the dielectric function has a negative real part , as occurs when one component is metallic .",
    "for example , mcgurn _",
    "et al._@xcite used this method to calculate the photonic band structure of a square lattice of metal cylinders in two dimensions ( 2d ) and of an fcc lattice of metal spheres embedded in vacuum in 3d .",
    "they found that that method converged well when the filling fraction @xmath4 ( i.e. , volume fraction of metal spheres or cylinders ) satisfied @xmath5 .",
    "et al._@xcite used the same method to calculate the photonic band structures for 2d metal cylinders in a square or triangular lattice in vacuum . for low @xmath4 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the calculated photonic band structures are just slightly perturbed versions of the dispersion curves for electromagnetic waves in vacuum . however , for @xmath7 and @xmath8-polarized waves ( magnetic field @xmath8 parallel to the cylinders ) , they obtained many nearly flat bands for @xmath9 ; these bands were found to converge very slowly with increasing numbers of plane waves .",
    "they later extended this work to systems with dissipation.@xcite to describe dispersive and absorptive materials , they used a complex , position - dependent form of dielectric function .",
    "they also introduced a standard linearization technique to solve the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "et al._@xcite extended the plane wave method to treat periodic composites with anisotropic dielectric functions .",
    "in particular , they studied the photonic band structures of a periodic array of anisotropic dielectric spheres embedded in air .",
    "they found that the anisotropy split degenerate bands , and narrowed or even closed the band gaps .",
    "much further work on anisotropic photonic materials has been carried out since this paper ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "a different type of periodic metal - insulator composite is a periodic arrangement of metallic spheres in an insulating host .",
    "et al._@xcite studied the dispersion relation for coupled plasmon modes in such a linear chain of equally spaced metal nanoparticles , using a near - field electromagnetic ( em ) interaction between the particles in the dipole limit .",
    "they also studied the transport of em energy around the corners and through tee junctions of the nanoparticle chain - array .",
    "park and stroud@xcite also studied the surface - plasmon dispersion relations for a chain of metallic nanoparticles in an isotropic medium .",
    "they used a generalized tight - binding calculations , including all multipoles .",
    "this approach is more exact than the previous point - dipole calculation,@xcite in a quasistatic limit , but still leaves out non - quasistatic effects associated with radiative damping ( i.e. , effects associated with the non - vanishing of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the electric field .",
    "they calculated the lowest bands as well as many higher bands and compared their results with those in ref .",
    "@xcite .    weber and ford@xcite",
    "have shown that all calculations within the quasistatic approximation omit important interactions between transverse plasmon waves and free photon modes , even if the interparticle separation is small compared to the wavelength of light .",
    "thus , most quasistatic calculations need to have certain corrections included at particular values of the wave vector . recently ,",
    "et al._@xcite have studied the photonic band structures of another type of structure , a so - called inverse opal structure .",
    "this structure is an fcc lattice of void spheres in a host of another material .",
    "such a structure can be prepared , e.g. , starting from an opal structure made of spheres of a convenient substance , infiltrating it with another material , then dissolving away the spheres . in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the photonic band structure of si inverse opal was calculated as a function of the infiltrated volume fraction @xmath4 of air voids using three - dimensional finite difference time domain ( 3d fdtd ) method .",
    "it was found that for certain values of @xmath4 , a complete band gap opens up between the eighth and ninth bands .    in the present work , first we study the photonic band structure of an inverse opal structure , such as that investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but instead of dielectric materials such as si , we consider metals as the infiltrated materials .",
    "thus , the material we study is also the inverse of the fcc array of metal spheres studied by mcgurn _",
    "et al._@xcite such metallic inverse opal structures have recently become of great interest , because it has been found that pb inverse opals exhibit superconductivity.@xcite these workers have studied the response of these materials to an applied magnetic field , and have found a highly non - monotonic fractional flux penetration into the pb spheres as a function of the applied field .    as a second example , we study the photonic band structure of a linear chain of nanopores in a metallic medium .",
    "this is an inverse structure of a linear chain of metallic nanospheres , of which the dispersion relation is given in ref .",
    "as anticipated , we get a kind of `` inverse image '' of the dispersion relation found by ref .",
    "@xcite in our system .    for both types of structures ,",
    "our primary method for studying the photonic band structures below the plasma frequency @xmath0 is a tight - binding approximation which is valid even in the non - quasistatic regime .",
    "because the analogs of the tight - binding atomic states decay exponentially in the metallic host medium , the resulting tight - binding waves do not lose energy radiatively , as do the corresponding waves along one - dimensional chains of metallic nanoparticles in air . furthermore , because the modes are expanded in `` atomic '' states rather than plane waves , there is no convergence problem as there can be in the plane wave case . the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
