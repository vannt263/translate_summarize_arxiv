    "distillation of continuous - variable entanglement is fundamentally limited by a no - go theorem which states that experimentally accessible entangled gaussian states can not be distilled by local gaussian operations and classical communication @xcite . in order to increase entanglement of a gaussian state such as two - mode squeezed vacuum by local operations ,",
    "one thus has to resort to non - gaussian operations @xcite .",
    "a prominent example of such an operation is the photon subtraction , that has been proposed for continuous - variable entanglement concentration in a seminal paper by opatrn _",
    "since then , the photon subtraction has been recognized as a crucial tool for implementing many tasks in optical continuous - variable quantum information processing .",
    "besides entanglement concentration @xcite , this includes generation of schrdinger cat - like states by subtracting photons from single - mode squeezed vacuum state @xcite , generation of arbitrary single - mode states of light beams @xcite , implementation of quantum gates for qubits encoded into superpositions of two coherent states @xcite , and probabilistic noiseless amplification of coherent states of light @xcite .",
    "although gaussian operations alone are useless for distillation of gaussian entanglement , it has been recently shown by zhang and van loock @xcite that the performance of entanglement concentration via local single - photon subtraction can be enhanced by suitable local squeezing operations . in this paper",
    "we further investigate this intriguing concept and clarify the origin of enhancement of entanglement concentration due to the local pre - squeezing .",
    "we next show that the same effect can be achieved also by local displacements , which are much easier and experimentally more feasible operations than squeezing .",
    "indeed , the combination of photon subtraction and coherent displacement has been recently successfully experimentally utilized to generate arbitrary superpositions of squeezed vacuum and squeezed single - photon states from squeezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "coherent displacement can be implemented by mixing the signal beam with a weak coherent laser beam on a highly unbalanced beam splitter .",
    "in contrast , squeezing is much more experimentally challenging and resource demanding operation . squeezing in cavity - based optical parametric amplifier would require efficient injection of the pulsed signal beam in the cavity as well as efficient retrieval of the squeezed beam which is a nontrivial task .",
    "squeezing based on a single passage through a nonlinear crystal pumped by a strong pulsed laser still requires careful modematching and may suffer from noise due to spontaneous parametric down - conversion producing pairs of photons in many modes .",
    "alternatively , one can employ an off - line generated auxiliary squeezed vacuum state combined with interference on an unbalanced beam splitter , homodyne detection and feedforward @xcite .",
    "this squeezing technique was successfully experimentally tested , however , the operation is imperfect and inevitably adds some extra noise due to finite squeezing of the auxiliary state .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a simple analysis of the local squeezing - enhanced entanglement concentration which reveals the origin of the entanglement enhancement in this scheme . in section iii",
    "we describe the displacement - enhnaced entanglement concentration procedure and we analytically determine the optimal displacement and success probability scaling in the limit of pure weakly squeezed input states , where the scheme achieves the maximum entanglement enhancement .",
    "we also numerically calculate the optimal local displacements maximizing entanglement of the distilled state for both pure and mixed gaussian two - mode squeezed states .",
    "finally , section iv contains brief summary and conclusions .     and",
    "bs@xmath0 are highly unbalanced beam splitters , @xmath1 is the shared ( generally mixed ) entangled state , and d@xmath2 and d@xmath0 denote single - photon detectors .",
    "( b ) entanglement concentration improved by local single - mode suqeezing @xmath3 .",
    "the state can be un - squeezed after concentration by inverse local operations @xmath4 without changing its entanglement ( c ) . ]",
    "the considered entanglement concentration scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "the entangled two - mode squeezed state is distributed from a source via some quantum channel to the two recipients traditionally called alice and bob who attempt to conditionally increase the entanglement of the shared state by local photon subtraction , which is a specific example of a quantum filter .",
    "the whole scheme is thus a typical example of a procrustean entanglement concentration protocol @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the photon subtraction is accomplished by means of a highly unbalanced beam splitter that reflects a tiny part of the incoming beam on a single - photon detector apd .",
    "a successful photon subtraction is heralded by a click of the detector .",
    "alice and bob exchange their measurement results via classical communication line and the entanglement concentration succeeds if they both register detector clicks . in the limit of very low beam splitter reflectance",
    ", the resulting operation can be described by action of annihilation operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 on modes a and b , respectively , even if the detectors have non - unit detection efficiency and can not distinguish number of photons .",
    "it is instructive to first investigate concentration of a pure two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes fock state , @xmath9 is a short - hand notation for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 stands for the two - mode squeezing constant . the non - normalized state",
    "after local photon subtractions can be expressed as @xmath13 alice and bob may amend the entanglement concentration protocol by local squeezing of modes a nad b prior to the photon subtraction @xcite , c.f .",
    "the filtering operation then reads @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a single - mode squeezing operation on mode m with squeezing constant @xmath16 . in order to clarify why the pre - squeezing can be useful",
    ", we apply an inverse unitary squeezing operation @xmath17 to the concentrated state which does not change its entanglement , see fig .",
    "1(c ) . the overall filtering operation",
    "@xmath18 then reads @xmath19 the squeezing transforms the annihilation operators into linear combination of annihilation and creation operators , and we have @xmath20\\otimes [ \\hat{b}\\cosh(s)+\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\sinh(s)].\\ ] ] we can thus see that the local pre - squeezing effectively converts the photon subtraction into a coherent combination of photon subtraction and photon addition .",
    "let us now investigate what happens in the limit of weak two - mode squeezing , @xmath21 .",
    "we can write @xmath22 where @xmath23 indicates small terms of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "after some algebra we get @xmath25 if we set @xmath26 , then we obtain @xmath27 note that the amplitude of the states @xmath28 and @xmath29 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath30 with respect to the amplitude of the dominant term @xmath31 . in the limit of very small @xmath32",
    "the result of entanglement concentration is a maximally entangled state of two qubits hence the protocol can extract one e - bit of entanglement from arbitrarily weakly squeezed initial state .",
    "the success probability of the protocol scales as @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the squeezing enhanced protocol should be contrasted with the ordinary concentration by local photon subtraction that in the limit @xmath21 provides only very weakly entangled state @xmath35 .",
    "we next show that similar improvement in the amount of extracted entanglement can be obtained if we replace the local squeezing operations with local displacements @xmath36 and @xmath37 , see fig .",
    "similarly as above , we assume that the displacement is undone after photon subtraction by inverse displacements @xmath38 and @xmath39 , c.f .",
    "the resulting local quantum filter reads @xmath40 the local displacements transform the photon subtraction into a coherent superposition of photon subtraction and identity operation and we have @xmath41 let us again consider the limit @xmath34 .",
    "we obtain @xmath42 the apparently dominant vacuum term corresponds to a separable state , but it can be completely eliminated by a destructive interference provided that @xmath43 . the maximal entanglement is then obtained if the displacements are real and symmetric , @xmath44 if we insert @xmath45 and @xmath46 given by eq .",
    "( [ ablambda ] ) into ( [ gpsi ] ) we get @xmath47 we can see that in the limit @xmath34 we again extract one e - bit of entanglement , although now in a slightly different form of a single photon split among the two modes a and b. the success probability of the scheme scales as @xmath48 for small @xmath32 . in comparison with the pre - squeezing strategy",
    "the success rate is thus smaller by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "nonetheless , the simplicity of displacement operation compensates for this reduced efficiency .",
    "note that the local photon subtractions combined with displacements can be seen as a local version of the non - local coherent photon subtraction demonstrated by ourjoumtsev _",
    "there the two beams reflected off the beam splitters bs@xmath2 and bs@xmath0 were combined on another balanced beam splitter and a click of an apd placed on one of its output ports heralded coherent photon subtraction associated with the filter @xmath49 .",
    "surprisingly , the present local scheme becomes equivalent to that non - local strategy in the limit of small @xmath32 and for carefully tuned local displacements ( [ ablambda ] ) .",
    "note also that the displacements can be equivalently performed on the ancilla input ports , e.g. by injecting weak coherent states there , see fig .",
    "yet another possibility is to displace the reflected beam right before the single photon detection , c.f .",
    "this latter scheme has been recently successfully experimentally utilized to generate qubit states formed by squeezed superpositions of vacuum and single - photon states @xcite .",
    "let us now analyze the performance of the displacement - enhanced entanglement concentration scheme beyond the limit of @xmath34 . in our model",
    "we take into account a non - zero reflectance @xmath50 of the beam - splitters bs@xmath2 and bs@xmath0 and we assume on - off single - photon detectors described by a two - component povm @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the identity operator and @xmath54 corresponds to a click of the the detector . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the detectors have unit efficiency .",
    "experiments usually involve highly unbalanced beam splitters with @xmath55 . in this limit , the main effect of non - unit detection efficiency @xmath56 is the reduction of success rate by a factor of @xmath57 .",
    "more specifically , the entanglement concentration scheme with inefficient detectors is equivalent to a scheme with perfect detectors and reduced reflectance of the beam splitters , @xmath58 $ ] , preceded by the transmission of the state through a lossy channel with transmittance @xmath59 . in the limit of @xmath60 the latter",
    "can be neglected since @xmath61 .",
    "we allow for an arbitrary initial mixed two - mode gaussian state @xmath1 as we shall investigate entanglement concentration of two - mode squeezed vacuum states transmitted over lossy channels .",
    "we denote by @xmath62 and @xmath63 the unitary operation describing mixing of two modes on the unbalanced beam splitters with reflectance @xmath50 .",

    "we quantify the entanglement of the concentrated state @xmath69 by logarithmic negativity @xmath70 , which is a computable measure of entanglement for non - gaussian mixed states @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath69 is mixed even for pure input @xmath1 due to the inability of the apds to resolve number of photons .",
    "recall that @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes partial transposition with respect to mode a and @xmath73 . in order to calculate",
    "@xmath74 we need to determine matrix elements of @xmath69 in fock state basis .",
    "one option is to explore the fact that for a gaussian input state @xmath1 the output state @xmath69 can be expressed as a linear combination of four gaussian states @xcite . for a gaussian state ,",
    "the density matrix elements in fock basis can be expressed in terms of multivariate hermite polynomials because the husimi q - function of the state , which is a generating function of these matrix elements , has a gaussian form .",
    "here we follow a more straightforward route and directly evaluate eq .",

    "numerical calculations indicate that it suffices to consider real displacements , adding complex phase factors does not further increase the entanglement . in the rest of the paper",

    "we have next shown that a similar entanglement enhancement can be achieved by employing local displacements instead of single - mode squeezing .",
    "remarkably , the entanglement is enhanced by a destructive quantum interference that suppresses or even completely eliminates the otherwise dominant vacuum term .",
    "the displacement - based scheme is much easier to implement experimentally than the scheme with local squeezers albeit at the cost of a somewhat reduced success rate of the protocol .",
    "note also that while the entanglement concentration schemes involving local displacement or local squeezing can produce similar amount of entanglement , the internal structure of the entangled states is rather different . in the weak - squeezing limit and up to local gaussian operations the displacement enhanced scheme essentially yields an entangled single - photon state @xmath91 while the scheme with local squeezers produces a state exhibiting almost perfect photon number correlations @xmath92 .    the analytical and numerical results indicate that the entanglement enhancement achieved by single photon subtractions combined with optimal local displacements is of the order of 1 e - bit . here",
    "the entanglement enhancement is defined as a difference between entanglement of concentrated and input states .",
    "even higher entanglement enhancement could be achieved by more sophisticated local filtering operations such as the recently proposed probabilistic noiseless amplifier that approximates the unphysical operation @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the amplification gain @xcite .",
    "such amplifier may in principle generate arbitrarily large amount of entanglement from any initial pure two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
