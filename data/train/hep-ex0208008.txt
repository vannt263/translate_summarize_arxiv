    "studies of the time dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath0 mixing continue to play an important role in the exploration of both the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix and the phenomenon of cp violation .",
    "the @xmath4 oscillation frequency is related to the poorly known ckm element @xmath5 according to  @xcite @xmath6 and has recently been precisely measured by the babar and belle collaborations  the current world average is @xmath7 @xmath2  @xcite . however",
    ", this measurement can not be translated into a precise determination of @xmath8 due the 15 - 20% theoretical uncertainty in @xmath9 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of lattice qcd calculations ) .",
    "uncertainties are reduced for the ratio @xmath10 where the quantity @xmath11 is estimated to be @xmath12 from lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath13 can be determined with an uncertainty smaller than that for @xmath14  @xcite . in the wolfenstein parameterization of the ckm matrix",
    ", we have @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite , but @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not well known",
    ". studies of @xmath4 and @xmath21 oscillations thus provide some of the strongest constraints on the ckm unitarity triangle parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "experimental studies of @xmath21 oscillations require two main ingredients : ( i ) reconstruction of the @xmath21 decay and its proper time , ( ii ) determination of the @xmath21 or @xmath22 flavor at both production and decay to classify the decay as either ` mixed ' ( if the tags disagree ) or ` unmixed ' ( otherwise ) .",
    "the significance for a @xmath21 oscillation signal can be approximated by  @xcite @xmath23\\ :        e^{-\\frac{1}{2 } ( \\dms \\sigma_t)^2 } ,    \\label{eq_signif}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the total number of decays selected , @xmath25 is the fraction of @xmath21 mesons in the selected sample , @xmath26 is the probability to incorrectly tag a decay as mixed or unmixed ( i.e. the mistag rate ) and @xmath27 is the proper time resolution .",
    "the proper time resolution depends on both the decay length resolution @xmath28 and the momentum resolution @xmath29 according to @xmath30 .",
    "based on the wolfenstein parameterization , we see that @xmath31 , which is of order of 20 ( the other wolfenstein parameters are of order 1 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 oscillations are expected to be much more rapid than @xmath4 oscillations .",
    "the ability to resolve such rapid oscillations thus requires excellent decay length and momentum resolution , and benefits from having a low mistag rate and a high @xmath21 purity .",
    "the study of the time dependence of @xmath0 mixing has been performed with different analysis techniques , ranging from fully inclusive to fully exclusive reconstruction of @xmath21 decay candidates .",
    "the study of @xmath21 oscillations is more chalenging than that of @xmath4 oscillations due to two main differences .",
    "first , only about 10% of @xmath32 quarks fragment into @xmath21 mesons , as compared to about 40% into @xmath4 mesons .",
    "second , the @xmath21 oscillation frequency is expected to be at least a factor of 20 larger than that for @xmath4 oscillations . to address this ,",
    "sophisticated analyses have been developed with an emphasis on lowering the mistag rate , increasing the @xmath21 purity and , especially , improving the proper time resolution , all of which affect the sensitivity to @xmath21 oscillations .",
    "the production flavor tag combines a number of different individual tags .",
    "the single most powerful tag exploits the large polarized forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath33 decays .",
    "this tag is available at sld thanks to the large electron beam polarization ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "a left- ( right- ) handed incident electron tags the quark produced in the forward hemisphere as a @xmath32 ( @xmath35 ) quark .",
    "this method yields a mistag rate of @xmath36 with nearly 100% efficiency .",
    "tags used in all analyses rely on charge information from the event hemisphere opposite that of the @xmath21 candidate : ( i ) charge of lepton from the direct transition @xmath37 , ( ii ) momentum - weighted jet charge , ( iii ) secondary vertex charge , ( iv ) charge of secondary vertex kaon from the dominant transition @xmath38 , ( v ) charge dipole of secondary vertex ( sld only ) .",
    "other tags from the same hemisphere as the @xmath21 candidate are also used : ( i ) unweighted ( or weighted ) jet charge , and ( ii ) charge of fragmentation kaon accompanying the @xmath21 meson .",
    "these various tags are combined on an event - by - event basis to yield an average mistag rate of approximately 22% at sld and 27 - 29% at lep .",
    "the analyses differ in the way the @xmath21 decay is reconstructed and thus in the way the decay flavor is determined .",
    "three general classes can be identified : inclusive , semi - exclusive and fully exclusive .",
    "inclusive analyses benefit from the large available statistics but suffer from low @xmath21 purity , whereas more exclusive analyses benefit from higher purity and resolution but suffer from the lack of statistics ( this is particularly true for the fully exclusive analyses ) .",
    "several analyses are discussed below to highlight these differences .",
    "inclusive analyses have been performed by aleph , delphi , opal and sld .",
    "the sld charge dipole analysis is the most sensitive fully inclusive method  @xcite .",
    "it aims to reconstruct the @xmath32-hadron decay chain topology .",
    "this method takes full advantage of the superb decay length resolution of the sld ccd pixel vertex detector to separate secondary tracks ( from the @xmath39 decay point ) from tertiary tracks ( from the @xmath40 decay point ) .",
    "the decay length resolution is parameterized by the sum of two gaussians with @xmath41 m ( 60% fraction ) and @xmath42 m ( 40% ) , whereas the momentum resolution is parameterized with @xmath43 ( 60% ) and 0.21 ( 40% ) .",
    "a `` charge dipole '' @xmath44 is defined as the distance between secondary and tertiary vertices signed by the charge difference between them such that @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) tags @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) decays .",
    "the average decay flavor mistag rate is estimated to be 22% and is mostly due to decays producing two charmed hadrons . a sample of 11,462 decays is selected with a @xmath21 purity estimated to be 16% ( higher than the production rate of 10% due to the fact that only neutral decays are selected ) .",
    "the most sensitive of all analyses is the aleph inclusive lepton analysis  @xcite , which selects semileptonic @xmath39 decays . in this analysis ,",
    "a @xmath40 meson is reconstructed inclusively based on topological and kinematical properties of the decay , and a resultant @xmath40 track is vertexed with the lepton and the @xmath32-hadron direction ( from the jet direction ) to form a @xmath39 decay vertex .",
    "the average decay length and momentum resolutions are @xmath49 m ( 75% fraction ) and @xmath50 m ( 25% ) , @xmath51 ( 60% ) and 0.20 ( 40% ) .",
    "fairly loose selection criteria are used at the various stages of the analysis to obtain a high statistics sample of 74,026 events .",
    "the analysis relies on several neural network algorithms to perform the following tasks : production flavor tagging , @xmath52 event selection , direct @xmath53 lepton selection , and @xmath21 fraction enhancement . to maximize sensitivity to @xmath21 oscillations",
    ", the analysis incorporates all the information event by event , including estimates of the decay length and momentum resolution .",
    "semi - exclusive analyses have been performed by aleph , cdf , delphi , opal and sld .",
    "@xmath21 decays are partially reconstructed in the modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 represents any charged hadron ( or system of several hadrons ) and the @xmath57 meson decay is either fully or partially reconstructed in the modes @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , etc .",
    "the most sensitive semi - exclusive analysis performed by delphi selects 436 @xmath63 events  @xcite .",
    "the small statistics is compensated by the high @xmath64 purity , estimated to be @xmath65 , and the good decay length and momentum resolution , @xmath66 m ( 82% fraction ) and @xmath67 m ( 16% ) , @xmath43 ( 82% ) and 0.16 ( 16% ) .",
    "analyses selecting @xmath68 final states benefit from higher statistics but are less sensitive than those selecting @xmath63 states because of lower @xmath21 purity and worse proper time resolution .",
    "the sld @xmath69+tracks analysis  @xcite combines fully reconstructed @xmath69 mesons with either a lepton or one ( or more ) charged hadron(s ) .",
    "it contributes especially at large values of @xmath70 thanks to a @xmath21 purity of 40% and the best available decay length resolution : @xmath71 m",
    "( 60% fraction ) and @xmath72 m ( 40% ) .",
    "finally , fully exclusive analyses have been performed by aleph  @xcite and delphi  @xcite via the ( all charged particles ) modes @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ( last two for delphi only ) , where the @xmath57 and @xmath77 are fully reconstructed .",
    "the decays @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are also reconstructed by adding one or more photons to the above final states ( aleph only ) or by including the `` satellite '' mass region below the @xmath21 mass peak .",
    "the number of decay candidates is 80 for aleph and 44 for delphi with signal purities of approximately 36% and 50% , respectively .",
    "the main advantage of the exclusive method is its excellent proper time resolution with a negligible contribution from momentum resolution ( @xmath81 ) . as a result , unlike all other methods , @xmath27 does not grow significantly with increasing proper time @xmath82 and thus the oscillation amplitude is not damped as @xmath82 increases . due to limited statistics ,",
    "this method is not competitive with respect to the inclusive and semi - exclusive methods .",
    "however , this is the method of choice for future studies of @xmath21 oscillations at hadron colliders .",
    "studies of the time dependence of @xmath0 mixing are carried out with the amplitude method , which is equivalent to a normalized fourier transform  @xcite . the oscillation amplitude @xmath83 is expected to be @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) for frequencies sufficiently far from ( close to ) the true oscillation frequency .",
    "all available measurements of the oscillation amplitude at @xmath86 are summarized in figure  [ fig_ampw ] .",
    "also shown are the sensitivities for each analysis to set a 95% c.l .",
    "lower limit on @xmath70 ( @xmath70 value at which @xmath87 ) .",
    "the measured oscillation amplitudes are combined  @xcite , taking statistical and systematic correlations into account , to obtain the world average amplitude spectrum shown in figure  [ fig_afitw ] .",
    "the combination also corrects for the different input parameters used ( @xmath88 , @xmath32-hadron lifetimes and production rates ) .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude statistical uncertainties measured by the inclusive analyses are adjusted to take into account the @xmath21 production rate of @xmath89 .",
    "the rise in statistical error as @xmath70 increases comes from the fact that an increasingly smaller fraction of the data sample has sufficient proper time resolution to resolve more rapid oscillations ; the better the resolution , the smaller the rise .",
    "the preliminary combined amplitude spectrum excludes mixing @xmath90 for @xmath91 @xmath2 at the 95% c.l . , whereas the sensitivity is 19.2  @xmath2 .",
    "the significance of the deviation from @xmath92 near @xmath93 is @xmath94 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the sensitivity has been increasing steadily over the past 8 years , the limit has remained near 15  @xmath2 for the past 3 years . in august 1999 , the limit was @xmath95  @xmath2 but the sensitivity was only 14.7  @xmath2 .",
    "many of the lep and sld analyses have been or are being finalized .",
    "one will thus have to wait for the next generation of experiments to measure the @xmath21 oscillation frequency .",
    "prospects for such a measurement during run 2 of the fermilab tevatron are excellent .",
    "there is some debate as to whether the uncertainty due to the extrapolation of lattice qcd calculations to light quark masses is properly accounted for , see for example , a.s .",
