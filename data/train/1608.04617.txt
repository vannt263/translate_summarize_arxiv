    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is a very useful framework in hadron physics in the low energy regime .",
    "chpt was first proposed to study the purely pseudoscalar meson system with the consistent chiral power counting scheme  @xcite , which enables us to calculate either a physical process or hadron property order by order .",
    "for example , the pion pion scattering amplitude in the low energy regime can be expanded in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the three - momentum of the pion . in the chiral limit , @xmath4 .",
    "the above scattering amplitude converges quickly with the soft pion momentum .",
    "the extension of the chpt to the matter field introduces a new large energy scale , the mass of the matter field which does not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "hence this mass scale @xmath5 will spoil the convergence of the chiral expansion . to overcome this obstacle , the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt )",
    "was developed  @xcite . within this scheme ,",
    "one also performs the heavy baryon expansion in terms of @xmath6 together with the chiral expansion . with the help of hbchpt ,",
    "the octet baryon masses , compton scattering amplitudes , axial charge , various electromagnetic form factors and many other observables have been investigated systematically  @xcite .",
    "historically , the experimental observation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon provides the crucial evidence that the nucleon is not a point particle .",
    "in fact , the magnetic moment of the baryon is an equally important observable as its mass , which encodes valuable information of its inner structure . in the past several decades",
    ", the magnetic moments of the octet baryons have been investigated extensively .",
    "in fact , their values have been measured quite precisely @xcite . within the chpt framework ,",
    "the magnetic moments of the octet baryons have been investigated by many groups  @xcite .",
    "the decuplet baryons are the spin - flavor excitations of the octet baryons . in strong contrast",
    ", the present knowledge of the magnetic moments of the decuplet baryons is rather poor . according to pdg @xcite , only the @xmath7 magnetic moment",
    "is measured precisely with @xmath8 .",
    "the other members of the decuplet baryons are not stable which renders the experimental measurement of their magnetic moments very challenging . after huge efforts ,",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnetic moment were extracted with sizeable uncertainty , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the electromagnetic properties of the decuplet baryons have been studied in various approaches such as the skyrme model  @xcite , the cloudy - bag model  @xcite , quark models  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite , chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and lattice qcd  @xcite . the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the decuplet baryons were computed to the next - to - leading order with chiral perturbation theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , where both the octet and decuplet baryons were included in the chiral loops . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the roper contribution to the @xmath13 magnetic moments was discussed . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the electromagnetic properties of the decuplet baryons were calculated to the next - to - leading order in the quenched and partially quenched chiral perturbation theory respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath14 was calculated in the framework of manifestly lorentz invariant baryon chiral perturbation theory with so - called the extended on - mass - shell renormalization scheme . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the radiative pion photoproduction on the nucleon @xmath15 in the @xmath13-resonance region , with the aim to determine the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) of the @xmath16 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have reviewed the recent progress in understanding the nature of the @xmath13-resonance and its electromagnetic excitation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the electromagnetic properties of the su(3)-flavor decuplet baryons were examined within a quenched lattice qcd simulation .",
    "the magnetic moments of the @xmath13 baryons were extracted from a lattice qcd simulation in ref .",
    "techniques were developed to calculate the four electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath13 using lattice qcd simulation in refs .",
    "@xcite , with particular emphasis on the sub - dominant electric quadrupole form factor that probes the deformation of the @xmath13 .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath17 baryon was studied in lattice qcd in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will exploit the hbchpt to investigate the electromagnetic properties of the decuplet baryons to the fourth order .",
    "the mass splitting between the octet and decuplet baryons is small .",
    "moreover , the decuplet baryons generally couple to the octet baryons strongly .",
    "for example , the @xmath13 resonance couples to the @xmath18 channel very strongly .",
    "so we explicitly consider both the octet and decuplet intermediate states in the loop calculation .",
    "we use dimensional regularization and modified minimal subtraction scheme to deal with the divergences from the loop corrections .",
    "we will calculate the charge ( e0 ) , electro quadrupole ( e2 ) , magnetic dipole ( m1 ) and magnetic octupole ( m3 ) form factors of the decuplet baryons in the framework of hbchpt . in the limit @xmath19",
    ", we extract the magnetic moments of the decuplet baryons .",
    "we also discuss the charge radii and magnetic radii of the decuplet baryons where the short - distance low energy constant ( lec ) is estimated with the help of the vector meson dominance model and long - range part is uniquely fixed by the loop corrections . since the experimental measurement of the electro quadrupole and magnetic octupole form factors of the decuplet baryons will be extremely difficult in the coming future , we move the calculation and discussions of these two form factors to the appendix . in the text , we focus on the calculation of the charge and magnetic form factors .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec3 ] , we discuss the electromagnetic form factors of the spin-@xmath20 particles .",
    "we introduce the effective chiral lagrangians of the decuplet baryon in section [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we calculate the magnetic form factors of the decuplet baryons order by order .",
    "we present our numerical results in section [ sec5 ] and conclude in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "we collect some useful formulae and the calculation of the e2 and m3 form factors of the decuplet baryons in the appendix .",
    "when the electromagnetic current is sandwiched between two decuplet baryon states , one can write down the general matrix elements which satisfy the gauge invariance , parity conservation and time reversal invariance  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 in the above equations , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the rarita - schwinger spinor for an on - shell heavy baryon satisfying @xmath26 and @xmath27 . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are real functions of @xmath30 . in literature",
