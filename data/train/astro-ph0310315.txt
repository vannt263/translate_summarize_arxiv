    "the decimetric synchrotron emission from galaxies is believed to arise from relativistic electrons accelerated by shock waves either in the interstellar medium , or in structures associated with an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . in the former case",
    ", there is evidence that the decimetric luminosity is proportional to the rate of massive star formation , the link arising because supernovas are perhaps the dominant source of accelerating shock waves @xcite . in the later case , the decimetric luminosity of an agn may be related to the physical properties of the underlying black hole , and the rate and mode of mass accretion by that black hole @xcite .",
    "observations of the total decimetric luminosity of a galaxy thus allow an estimate of the extinction - free star - formation rate in galaxies where agn emission can be considered negligible .",
    "conversely , where the star formation rate is relatively low they provide information on the character of activity excited by a nuclear black hole .",
    "a few galaxies emit significant decimetric from combined nuclear star - formation and agn activity @xcite .",
    "the knowledge provided by radio flux density measurements is greatly enhanced when optical spectroscopic data are also available .",
    "optical spectra reveal the galactic redshift , allowing the calculation of luminosities and hence estimates of the cosmic evolution of the rates of star - formation and black hole mass accretion .",
    "they also reveal the age and other properties of the most optically luminous components of the galactic stellar population and , in some cases , the state of excitement of a substantial fraction of the interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "investigations of large galaxy samples having combined optical and radio data offer opportunities to address several outstanding astrophysical problems .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has measured the optical spectra of over 220,000 galaxies photometically selected to have an extinction - corrected magnitude brighter than @xmath5=19.45 .",
    "the survey comprises strips at the equator , and near the south galactic pole ( sgp ) .",
    "the sgp strip densely covers @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , along with 99 randomly placed @xmath9 ( diameter ) fields .",
    "@xcite studied the relatively bright radio sources among the 2dfrgs objects by cross - matching the 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ? * ) with the first @xmath4 20% of the 2dfgrs .",
    "approximately 1.5% of the 2dfgrs galaxies ( @xmath4 5% nvss sources ) have radio counterparts at the nvss radio flux density detection limit of 2.8  mjy .",
    "presumably , the majority of unmatched ( 95% ) nvss 1.4  ghz sources are agns whose optical counterparts are too faint to be detected at @xmath5=19.45 ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "some 60% of the identifications are agns ( radio galaxies and some seyferts ) and the remainder 40% comprised of star - forming objects .",
    "@xcite note that complete cross - matching of the 2dfgrs and nvss will provide approximately 4,000 radio source spectra , a sample large enough to measure radio galaxy evolution to @xmath10 and to locate the most luminous star - forming galaxies to @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite have reported evidence at the level of two standard deviations for evolution in the rate of star formation density between the mean redshifts , @xmath12 0.02 and 0.06 , of their nvss / ugc sample and the nvss/2dfgrs sample of @xcite , respectively .",
    "there is considerable interest in seeking radio identifications of 2dfrgs objects below the nvss flux density limit .",
    "spectroscopy of the optical counterparts of radio sources found in sub - mjy surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the faint radio population will be a mixture of star - forming galaxies and agns , as it is for the mjy radio identifications .",
    "interestingly , 1.4  ghz radio source counts rise sharply towards the euclidean rate near 1  mjy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a phenomenon ascribed to the rising proportion of star - forming galaxies in the sub - mjy population @xcite . in view of the tight correlation between radio and far infra - red ( fir )",
    "luminosity among the star - forming population , these galaxies likely correspond to the population of lower star formation rate `` iras galaxies '' seen at apparently brighter magnitudes",
    ". studies of the sub - mjy counterparts of the 2dfgrs objects will thus encompass star - forming objects down to @xmath13  whz@xmath14 out to redshifts of @xmath15 , where evolution appears to have occurred , as well as agns of moderate radio luminosity .",
    "the sgp part of 2dfgrs covers over 900 square degrees and would require a very large allocation of radio telescope time to undertake a co - extensive sub - mjy survey . acknowledging this , we have undertaken a pilot study of a selected region of the 2dfgrs ( equivalent area of one 2dfrgs - field ) , employing the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) at 1.4  ghz to explore probable outcomes and optimal observing strategies for a more extensive survey .",
    "section @xmath16 describes the survey field selection , observations and data reduction and @xmath17 the procedures used to derive radio flux measurements and radio upper limits of the 2dfgrs objects .",
    "@xmath18 presents the radio luminosity function derived from our sample and comparison with that of @xcite . in @xmath19",
    "we explore the radio detection rate of 2dfgrs sources as a function of survey depth and in @xmath20 we consider the optimisation of a full - scale sub - mjy survey .    throughout the paper we have used @xmath21 , @xmath22kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 , and adopted for all sources , a radio spectral index @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "one aim of this pilot survey is to investigate a survey strategy which yields optimal benefit from the atca observing time that would be invested in a deep , large - scale radio follow - up of the 2dfgrs .",
    "the basic trade - off lies between the steeply rising surface density of sources at fainter survey limits , versus the quadratic dependence of survey sensitivity on integration time .",
    "this implies a strategy in which a small area is surveyed very deeply , and a progressively larger area is surveyed to a progressively poorer sensitivity . given the breadth of the total radio luminosity functions for both star - forming and agn galaxies , and the weak dependence of the bi - variate radio luminosity function on optical luminosity , it would be hard to argue that any flux density range is to be preferred over any other , suggesting a strategy in which equal numbers of sources are detected to a progressively changing flux density limit .",
    "table  1 presents the results of calculations designed to illustrate this strategy .",
    "the table uses the published sensitivity of the atca at 1.4  ghz using two 128  mhz if channels , namely that a point source of @xmath25  mjy is detected at the field centre with @xmath26 sensitivity in a time of @xmath27 minutes , provided that full @xmath28 coverage is obtained ( atca on - line sensitivity calculator ) .",
    "the table relies on integral source densities read from fig .",
    "2(b ) in @xcite .",
    "according to the table , a single pointing observed for 5,000  m ( 83  h ) would reveal just over 3,000 sources per square degree , brighter than 30  @xmath1jy , and approximately the same number of sources would be detected to a @xmath26 limit of 1  mjy if an area of 34 pointings was surveyed for a total of 170  m ( 3  h ) .",
    "these values are ideal estimate , excluding observation overheads . in practice , there are several other factors that must be considered in designing the survey .",
    "the limits given in the table refer to the most sensitive part of the primary beam , and can be approached to within a factor of about @xmath29 over a large area only if mosaicing techniques are exploited .",
    "observations must be staged to provide adequate @xmath28 coverage , and bright radio sources must be avoided to achieve high dynamic range ."
