    "because of their extreme environments , clusters are interesting places in which to study galaxy evolution @xcite . their cores have the highest volume density of galaxies in the universe so that any environmental dependence of galaxy formation or evolution processes should be most pronounced there , when contrasted with studies of the field population .",
    "a more pedestrian motivation for studying galaxies in clusters is that the high surface density of objects makes them easy targets for imaging and multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "reasonably well - selected samples of clusters are now available up to redshift approaching @xmath9 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , it could be argued that the sample of well - studied clusters ( those with high - resolution imaging , morphological measurements , and extensive spectroscopy ) is still fairly small .",
    "the small sample means that , if galaxy clusters are a diverse population ( in terms of richness , x - ray luminosity , behavior of galaxy populations ) , then it will be difficult to draw the correct general conclusions from studying the present sample .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to trace the pedigree of the sample of clusters that has been well - studied to this date . by this",
    "we mean that a complex and tangled process of selection has been applied to broader samples of clusters and that process results in the well - studied sample that presently exists .",
    "if , for example , a cluster was chosen for extensive spectroscopy because of the presence of a large fraction of blue galaxies , and then chosen for hst imaging because it had a large population of emission - line galaxies , then this cluster can not be claimed to be a member of a representative set of clusters .",
    "conclusions drawn from a sample with this type of pre - selection for detailed study will not be generally applicable .",
    "the cnoc @xcite sample of clusters was chosen by x - ray luminosity and redshift and should avoid some of these potential problems .",
    "the phenomenology of galaxy populations in clusters can be divided roughly ( and perhaps not physically ) into five areas .",
    "the first is the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies which dominate the core of clusters @xcite and which may have been in place prior to cluster virialization @xcite .",
    "ellipticals seem to form the backbone of the cluster galaxy population . in local clusters",
    "they show a very tight color - magnitude relation with small scatter which implies either an early formation epoch or synchronization of formation times @xcite .",
    "nearby ellipticals follow a tight fundamental plane relation between size , surface brightness , and velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the tightness of the cluster color - magnitude relation seems to be preserved @xcite to @xmath10 placing tighter constraints on the formation epoch .",
    "studies of the moderate redshift fundamental plane @xcite and the relation between size and luminosity @xcite , a projection of the fundamental plane , indicate that cluster ellipticals are evolving passively to @xmath11 , that is , their stellar populations are aging with little ongoing star formation .",
    "the data that are available at the present time indicate that all ellipticals in all clusters that have been studied evolve in a similar fashion .",
    "interestingly , cluster and field elliptical populations seem to evolve in an identical manner @xcite .",
    "the second observed cluster phenomenon is the morphology - density relation or morphology - clustercentric radius relation @xcite .",
    "these relations describe how the relative fraction of different morphological types varies rapidly with distance from the cluster core or with the local galaxy density .",
    "cluster cores are dominated by elliptical and s0 galaxies whereas the outer , lower - density regions more nearly approach a spiral - rich mix of types similar to the field .",
    "it is still debated whether the dependence on density or distance from the cluster center is more fundamental .",
    "dressler ( 1997 ) compared the morphology - density relation in local clusters with those at moderate redshift . when clusters of all types are viewed together",
    "the morphology - density relation is nearly absent at @xmath12 except for the regions of highest density where ellipticals dominate .",
    "in contrast , the low redshift sample of all cluster types shows a clear and continuous morphology - density relation .",
    "if , however , the clusters are divided into samples of high - concentration regular clusters and low - concentration or irregular clusters the situation is different . at low redshift",
    "the morphology - density relation is observed in clusters of all types whereas , at @xmath12 , only the high - concentration clusters show a clear relation .",
    "irregular clusters show no dependence of the fractions of any particular morphological type on local density .    the butcher - oemler ( b - o ) effect @xcite is the third phenomenon related to cluster galaxy populations but the first to be reported .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 33 clusters with @xmath13 and found a rapid increase in the fraction of blue galaxies ( defined as those with b - v colors more than 0.20 mag bluer than the ridge line of early - type galaxies ) with redshift . in the local universe ,",
    "the fraction of cluster galaxies that meet this criteria is a few percent whereas , at @xmath12 , some clusters have blue fractions approaching 35% ( although the redshift dependence is not uniform for all clusters ) .",
    "the effect continues to @xmath14 @xcite but there is a wide range of values even at low redshift . @xcite and @xcite found , from high - resolution ground - based imaging , that many of the butcher - oemler galaxies were disk galaxies with widely distributed star formation ( as opposed to concentration toward the nucleus ) and that galaxy - galaxy interactions appear to be responsible for the enhanced star formation in some of the systems .",
    "these effects were confirmed by hst imaging @xcite .",
    "@xcite called into question a direct link between blue color and interactions and pointed out the possible effect of magnitude - selection on the spectroscopic samples .",
    "the fourth problem of phenomenology is the role of interactions , mergers , or `` galaxy harassment '' @xcite in the evolution of cluster galaxy population .",
    "there are actually two problems .",
    "the first is the effect of interactions between galaxies and the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) and the second is the effect of galaxy - galaxy interactions on the evolving population .",
    "the velocity dispersion in rich clusters is large ( @xmath15 km / sec ) so that galaxy - galaxy encounter velocities are typically too high for actual merging to be a probable outcome of galaxy encounters .",
    "still there exists the possibility of modifying galaxy morphology by close encounters .",
    "galaxy `` harassment '' @xcite has been proposed as a potentially important driver of cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "many studies note the large fraction of apparently interacting galaxies , for example @xcite and @xcite . but",
    "the absence of a correlation between nearest neighbor distance and color ( indicative of star formation activity ) in clusters @xcite is puzzling .",
    "in contrast , @xcite claim direct evidence in a cluster at @xmath16 for merger - driven production of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "the merger product progenitors are typically red , early - type galaxies so that they do not provide part of the solution to the b - o problem .",
    "the most recently defined ( and fifth ) phenomenon to come into focus is the so - called `` s0 problem '' . in the study of the morphology - density relation by @xcite",
    "it was found that although the fractions of galaxies of type s0 in clusters show little dependence on galaxy density either locally or at @xmath12 ( regardless of cluster type ) , the overall fraction of the galaxy population contained in s0s is much lower ( @xmath17 ) at moderate redshift than in clusters in the local universe ( where s0s constitute @xmath18 of the population ) .",
    "the spiral fraction varies in such a way to roughly balance this change with redshift .",
    "these two facts taken together suggest that some process is causing the transformation from spirals into s0s from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "our understanding of star formation in clusters  which clearly has important ramifications for all of the observational phenomena described above  has improved , to some degree , in recent years .",
    "it has been shown clearly @xcite that star formation is suppressed in clusters relative to the field and that this effect is present over the entire cluster volume out to @xmath21 twice the virial radius . furthermore",
    ", this effect is not due to the existence of the morphology - density relation .",
    "a comparison of cluster and field galaxies with matched sizes , and ratios of bulge - to - total luminosities @xcite shows that the cluster galaxies have distributions with lower mean star - formation rates .",
    "large analysis of spectroscopic data to study the frequency of star - forming and post - starburst galaxies have been done by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "there is real disagreement in these studies about whether post - starburst galaxies are more common in clusters relative to the field which would indicate the truncation of star - formation upon infall into the cluster .",
    "@xcite present a modeling of the ongoing accretion of field galaxies with their star - formation declining on a gas - consumption timescale after their gas reservoirs have been stripped off by interaction with the icm .",
    "the curious observation that the suppression of star formation occurs out to large distances from the cluster core is explained by the feature of their n - body simulations that many galaxies observed as far out as twice the virial radius have , in fact , visited the central regions of the cluster in the past .",
    "the present study presents a large catalog of photometric and morphological measurements of a set of four x - ray luminous clusters spanning a wide range in redshift .",
    "a preliminary analysis of one of the aspects of galaxy evolution in clusters is presented .",
    "a strong emphasis is put here on describing the fitting and analysis techniques employed , but an examination of the luminosity evolution of small disk galaxies is also presented . in ",
    "[ data ] a description of the data selected for this study and their reduction is made , and the method used to get a quantitative description of the galaxy morphology is presented in  [ morphology ] .",
    "finally , in  [ results ] and  [ discussion ] are presented and discussed the results of the study .",
    "the discussion is centered around the main result : luminosity evolution . however , other questions are raised , such as the color - magnitude and morphology - density relations , to verify the validity of the fitting technique and the reliability of the classification method applied on the galaxy sample .    all cosmology - dependent results in this paper",
    "are derived using @xmath22 km sec@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the cnoc ( canadian network for observational cosmology ) cluster redshift survey @xcite is a study of 16 galaxy clusters with x - ray luminosity in excess of @xmath26 ergs s@xmath23 and with redshifts covering the range @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "such clusters are likely to be rich and virialized .",
    "the survey consists of imaging data and redshifts for approximately 2600 faint galaxies .",
    "a number of important results have been derived from this dataset , ranging from a determination of @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite to studies of evolution of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "three clusters from the cnoc sample were chosen for further imaging with hst .",
    "they were selected out of the 16 in order to cover an interesting redshift range .",
    "they are ms1358.4 + 6245 @xcite , ms1621.5 + 2640 @xcite , and ms0015.9 + 1609 @xcite ( hereafter ms1358 , ms1621 , and ms0016 , respectively ) .",
    "existing archival imaging was supplemented with new imaging with the intent of sampling galaxies at a variety of distances from the cluster center .",
    "the cluster redshifts are presented in table [ tab1 ] . in order to cover a wide range of redshifts ,",
    "a fourth cluster is added to the present study , cluster ms 1054.4 - 0321 ( ms1054 ) at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "ms1054 is also a x - ray cluster , and so has been selected on the same basis as the three cnoc clusters . ms1054 and the three cnoc clusters are part of the emss ( _ einstein observatory _ extended medium - sensitivity survey , @xcite ) , and their x - ray fluxes",
    "are presented in table [ tab1 ] ( note , however , that a recent reanalysis of the x - ray luminosities of a cluster sample with @xmath32 including our three cnoc clusters , suggests that the values in the emss are underestimated @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster galaxy sample in the present paper has an excellent redshift baseline ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) and thus is suitable for the study of the change in galaxy properties with redshift .",
    "secondly , it samples these clusters over a range of distance from the cluster center so that the effect of galaxy environment can be taken into account .",
    "the original imaging of the cnoc clusters was obtained at cfht using the multi - object spectrograph and this imaging was of moderate quality with seeing largely in the range 0.9 to 1.1 arcseconds and significant variations in the point - spread function within the frames . for the present study ,",
    "additional data was acquired with the _ hubble space telescope _ for the three selected clusters .",
    "clusters ms0016 , ms1358 , and ms1621 were observed with the wfpc2 and each field was observed with two filters : f814w and either f450w or f555w . to this data core",
    "was added previous wfpc2 observations of these clusters and of ms1054 .",
    "a large quantity of data @xcite was produced for ms1358 in the f814w and f606w bands .",
    "the same filters were used to observe ms1054 @xcite .",
    "some additional exposures or ms0016 were taken with f814w and f555w ( proposals 8020 and 5378 ) .",
    "figure [ radec ] shows the distribution of the galaxies in each cluster , resulting from the combination of all these data sets .",
    "the circles represent the characteristic radius of each cluster , @xmath33 , the distance from the center where the average density is two hundred times the critical density of the universe ( the values of @xmath33 are given in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the data were reduced by an automated pipeline , developed at the canadian astronomy data centre , that takes as input an `` association '' name ( defined as a group of images that can be co - added ) and determines the offsets between the images ( the `` dither '' pattern ) and the other information needed to execute the stacking and sky subtraction .",
    "this pipeline is composed largely of components from a number of stsdas and iraf @xcite packages . for the present study images",
    "were simply shifted and averaged .",
    "the performance of this pipeline was verified by repeating the processing for the data in this paper independently in a manual mode and inspecting the results at each stage .",
    "the output of the pipeline is the stacked and cosmic ray - rejected image .",
    "corrections for systematic errors in the astrometry derived from the hst images using their wcs information are also made automatically by this pipeline .",
    "a number of minor image anomalies had to be corrected before the data were analyzed .",
    "the cluster ms1358 + 62 was observed in the continuous viewing zone of hst @xcite , and most images showed large shadow stripes along the diagonals of the frame .",
    "to correct for this effect , the frames were rotated by the appropriate angle to position the stripes horizontally or vertically . then using a long and thin median filter box , filtered images representing the shadow pattern",
    "were obtained and then subtracted from the original images .",
    "the filtered images were produced by the median task in iraf , which acts by replacing the central pixel of the box by the median of all the pixels in that window .",
    "the shape of the box ( @xmath34 pixels ) allowed the median to be computed only on the sky , leaving out the objects .",
    "after applying this correction , the sky value is more uniform , and no significant noise enhancement is noted in the previously shadowed regions .",
    "most of the exposures also had to be corrected for bad pixels .",
    "photometric zeropoints in the ab system were calculated using the standard photplam and photflam parameters of hst imaging .",
    "the values taken are from the last updated tables ] , and the zeropoints are obtained by : @xmath35 these magnitude zeropoints were then corrected to account for galactic extinction with factors produced by the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ( values are presented in table [ tab1 ] for @xmath36-band extinction , under @xmath37 ) .",
    "a catalog of galaxies was created using the sextractor software @xcite . before doing so",
    ", the borders of the frames along the edges with insufficient signal were masked and were filled with random noise with the same dispersion as that of the actual image .",
    "this was done to avoid spurious detections that are produced by sextractor along the edges where there is an abrupt transition from image noise to zero noise in the borders .",
    "the noise was generated using the mknoise task in iraf .",
    "this procedure yields a cleaner , and no less complete , catalog of galaxies .    in order to determine the probability of detection as a function of galaxy type , simulations of the detection process",
    "were carried out .",
    "a range of galaxy types , sizes , and central surface brightness were created , convolved with the observed point - spread function , and distributed at random across the actual frames .",
    "crowding leads to a loss of detection sensitivity and the number of galaxies simulated on each frame was limited to a reasonable number ( 5 - 10 per image ) to avoid unrealistic levels of crowding .",
    "several thousand galaxies of each type with a range of brightness were simulated for each of the clusters .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio at a given apparent magnitude varies from cluster to cluster and , in some cases , from image to image within a cluster .",
    "simulations were made over all actual images of the clusters .",
    "sextractor was run on the images that contained all of the real galaxies plus the added simulated galaxies and the list of galaxies detected by sextractor was compared to the input list of simulated galaxies .",
    "the detection probability for a given galaxy type , size , and brightness is the ratio of number of galaxies detected to the number of galaxies inserted into the images .",
    "this number is averaged over all of the fields of a given cluster .",
    "figure [ select ] shows the detection probability as percentages in the plane of observed disk central surface brightness and disk scale length in arcseconds . this figure shows the results for pure disk galaxies only . for a galaxy with a disk of a given size and surface brightness the probability of detection",
    "is increased with the addition of a bulge component .",
    "the lines on figure [ select ] show the nominal limiting magnitudes ( f814w(ab)=23.0 for ms1054 and f814w(ab)=22.5 for the other clusters ) and the horizontal lines indicate the angular size that corresponds to a scale length of 2 kiloparsecs .",
    "the simulation of the detection process for disk galaxies produced the probability contours at 10% , 50% , 80% , and 95% .",
    "brighter than the nominal limiting magnitude the galaxy detection probability is very high ( roughly 95% or better ) for all disks with sizes of 2 kiloparsec or smaller . at larger sizes the samples are incomplete for low - surface brightness galaxies even though they may have integrated brightness higher than the nominal limiting magnitude . for example , in these clusters , disk galaxies with central surface brightness of @xmath38 and sizes of 0.8 arcseconds have a probability of being detected that is",
    "approximately 50% . in all of the clusters the region of large , low surface - brightness disks",
    "is sparsely populated .",
    "it is not possible to know from these data and this detection procedure whether disk galaxies are present in those regions but remain undetected or are simply not present .",
    "therefore , we can make unbiased comparisons of the properties of the disk galaxy populations among these clusters only for scale lengths smaller than 2 kpc and at apparent brightness higher than the nominal limiting magnitude .      in order to get redshifts and other spectroscopic information from different surveys @xcite ,",
    "accurate coordinates were required for each galaxy . from the known pixel coordinates and the wcs positions of each image , approximate coordinates are calculated using the metric task of the stsdas package in iraf .",
    "this task corrects for geometric distortions specific to the wfpc2 on hst . when compared to stars that appear on the hst frames , systematic errors",
    "are frequently observed in the coordinates from the metric task due to errors in the hst guide star positions . to correct these errors ,",
    "each frame was searched for usno catalog @xcite stars and a mean systematic offset was derived .",
    "the systematic errors should be reduced to a few tenths of an arcsecond ( rms ) compared to the usno catalog system .",
    "all the positions given in this paper are these corrected coordinates .",
    "a total of @xmath39 galaxies were found by sextractor above the initial detection threshold for each cluster ( f814w@xmath40 for ms1358 and ms1621 , and f814w@xmath41 for ms0016 and ms1054 ) .",
    "quantitative morphological measurements are made for these galaxies by fitting parametric models to the luminosity profiles @xcite .",
    "the use of parametric models is motivated by the fact that the galaxy profiles are of similar size to the instrumental point - spread - function and need to be corrected for this effect and for sampling .",
    "a set of commonly - accepted models is adopted here .",
    "exponential and de vaucouleurs profiles are used .",
    "one advantage of this quantitative approach to morphology is that a number of measurements ( size , surface brightness , ratio of bulge luminosity to total luminosity ) are derived from the images rather than simply a morphological class .",
    "a second advantage is that this scheme can be used to deduce evolutionary phenomena by comparing nearby and distant galaxies , if one is careful to use data that are truly comparable .",
    "clearly , hst resolution is very valuable at @xmath42 but moderate aperture telescopes with moderate ground - based seeing can produce imaging of nearby galaxies that has similar signal - to - noise ratio at a given luminosity and similar physical resolution , in kiloparsecs , to hst .",
    "these local samples form ideal comparison datasets for hst .",
    "further , if both the nearby and distant datasets are analyzed in a uniform manner , it is reasonable to believe that accurate evolutionary information might result from such comparisons , despite the fact that it is well - known that most galaxies show deviations , of varying degree , from the ideal models adopted here .",
    "a disadvantage of the present approach is that comparisons with studies that are based upon visual classification ( e.g. @xcite ) are difficult .",
    "for example , an intermediate galaxy might be defined ( as it is here ) as having a ratio of bulge - to - total luminosity @xmath3 .",
    "such a classification undoubtedly includes galaxies which would be defined as sa , s0 , and e galaxies using visual classification methods .",
    "this is a strong motivation to draw conclusions from the comparison of samples that have all been analyzed in a consistent way .",
    "comparisons with work where visual classification is an important feature need to be done cautiously .      for a single galaxy",
    ", the images produced with both filters were fitted simultaneously .",
    "the size , ellipticity , and orientation of each component of the galaxy is assumed to be identical in both filters .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the bulge and disk components are allowed to vary independently so that the model may reproduce a galaxy whose bulge is a different color from its disk .",
    "we chose to use the integrated color of the galaxy to accomplish the k - corrections because the individual component colors were very noisy relative to the integrated value and we present only the integrated values in the catalogs .",
    "`` postage stamp '' images of the galaxies in the object catalog were produced by first measuring accurate coordinates for the center of each galaxy , and by measuring the sky value .",
    "then , a square image centered on the new galaxy coordinates is produced and the sky is subtracted from it .",
    "the size of the box is chosen according to the fitting radius of the galaxy , which is calculated with parameters produced by sextractor .",
    "the first step of the fitting technique is to produce a symmetrized image , in order to eliminate strong asymmetric features or close companions .",
    "this is achieved by rotating the stamp by 180 , subtracting that rotated frame from the original one then clipping at @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the error in a given pixel accounting for sky noise and noise form the galaxy itself ) of this difference image to leave only significant positive deviations from symmetry .",
    "then this clipped image is subtracted from the original image to produce the symmetrized frame @xcite .",
    "a point spread function is then made , as described in @xcite .",
    "symmetrized galaxies from both filter images are then fitted with three different models : a @xmath45 bulge , an exponential disk and an hybrid model where the total luminosity is divided between a bulge and a disk components . for each model , the best fit is determined .",
    "the optimization process is done by varying the main morphological parameters : the size of the model , the axial ratio of the ellipse and its position angle , and by calculating the value of the @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the best fit is then submitted to a `` trend test '' @xcite to look for systematic errors with radius left behind when the modeled galaxy is subtracted from the original image . this second test is necessary since the @xmath47 does not account for the ordering of the pixels : it computes the distance between each pixel and the sky level as if they were all independent .",
    "thus , a mediocre fit can yield a fairly good result at the @xmath47 test . in this second test , pixels are ordered by radius from the centroid of the galaxy .",
    "the radial coordinate for this test is computed in the frame where each model is circular ( in other words the ellipticity is taken into account when computing a `` radial '' variable for this test ) . using this radially - ordered sequence , each pixel",
    "is compared with its neighbors to look for any systematic of trends .",
    "this is done by computing the mean square successive difference , @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the flux difference between two successive pixels in the chain , and @xmath51 is the total number of pixels . if there are no trends present , that difference is expected to be about @xmath43 .",
    "each galaxy has then six values associated with it that will come to play in determining its type ( bulge , disk , or bulge and disk ) : the @xmath47 and the trend statistic results for the best fit of each of the three models .",
    "note that the values of the statistics are computed over all of the pixels in the two bands that were used in each fit .",
    "our strategy was to use visual inspection of the fits to create a training set that would then be applied uniformly to the results of the entire fitted dataset .",
    "a large number of galaxies were examined visually together with the fitted models and the residuals of those fits .",
    "the residual images were the most helpful at assigning a type to the galaxies .",
    "this procedure also provided a subjective estimate of the effect of nearby galaxies on the fits ( which should have been largely removed by the symmetrization process ) and also an estimate of the frequency of failed fits .",
    "visual inspection made it possible to estimate the magnitude , for each cluster , at which it became impossible to make a meaningful discrimination between models .",
    "the process of deciding on class assignment ( bulge , disk , or bulge - plus - disk ) included access to a file of the parameters and the statistics of the fit .",
    "these played an important role in the decisions that were made .",
    "we show in figure [ screen ] the type of display that was used in the classification .",
    "the five images in the top row of figure [ screen ] are ( left - to - right ) : the original image , the symmetrized image , the residual after the best - fit bulge has been subtracted from the original image , the residual after the best - fit disk has been subtracted and the residual after the best - fit bulge - plus - disk model has been subtracted .",
    "the numbers below the residual images are the f - test probabilities that the fit is as good as the best fit ( the best fit always has a probability of 1 ) .",
    "the 3 images in the row second from the top are the best - fit bulge , disk , and bulge - plus - disk model images .",
    "the value of the trend statistics is below those images .",
    "the 2 images on the bottom row are the bulge component of the bulge - plus - disk model and the disk component of the bulge - plus - disk model .",
    "other information is also marked on the display . in this example",
    "the disk model is the best fit although the two component ( bulge - plus - disk ) model can not be rejected at even the 5% level .",
    "it makes no difference in this case which of the two acceptable models is adopted because the fitted disk parameters are nearly identical and the bulge component is negligible , as confirmed by the images .",
    "the pure bulge model is rejected at a high level of significance .    the most obvious way to choose",
    "the best fit is to take the fit with the smallest value of @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for rejecting this approach is that the models which represent the best fit from a statistical standpoint sometimes contain components that are `` un - physical '' in the sense that they have components that are effectively trying to fit faint residuals of nearby neighbors that have not been fully removed by the symmetrizing process , artifacts of some kind , or even low - level errors in the sky - level estimate .",
    "this happens most frequently with bulge - plus - disk models where a legitimate ( physical ) component is accompanied by a second component which is unrealistic and often has very low surface brightness .",
    "a visual examination quickly identifies such components but the statistics can not directly do so .",
    "it is important to note that our final catalog will certainly contain some errors of this type and any analysis based on the catalog needs to be sensitive to that fact .",
    "when the quality of the fit for different models was too similar to effectively differentiate between a single component model ( either bulge or disk ) and the bulge - plus - disk model , the galaxy was assigned the type of the simpler model ( disk or bulge ) . in the cases where it was impossible to visually discriminate between the bulge and the disk models , the type assigned was `` uncertain '' .",
    "galaxies with such type helped determine the faint magnitude limit for the sample .",
    "initially , all galaxies with observed magnitudes ( in the ab system ) @xmath52 for ms1358 and ms1621 , and @xmath53 for ms0016 and ms1054 were fitted .",
    "however , the types assigned to galaxies fainter than a magnitude of 23 are mostly `` uncertain '' .",
    "this limit of f814w@xmath54 corresponds exactly to that used by @xcite when visually classifying galaxies from similar images .",
    "approximately 1100 galaxies ( @xmath17 of the data set ) were inspected and classified as bulge , disk , bulge - plus - disk , or uncertain and the fit quality was recorded .",
    "the galaxies classified are a representative sample of the whole catalog , with galaxies out of each cluster and proportionally representing the whole magnitude range .",
    "most of the visual inspection was done by a single observer ( as ) , but a subset of 150 galaxies was repeated by a second observer ( ds ) , and the two sets of classes were compared .",
    "agreement occurred in 72% of the cases , with every disparity resulting from galaxies that fell past the faint magnitude threshold established above , or for which a single component model and the combined one were practically equivalent .",
    "there were no cases where one observer selected the bulge model when the other one preferred the disk .",
    "this evaluation of the fitted models for 20% of the sample was meant to produce a training set that could be used to perform an objective automated classification on the entire sample .",
    "the goal of this process was to assign a fit type to every galaxy by comparing them to those that had been visually classified .",
    "the obvious interest of this method is to allow for a uniform classification of every galaxy , based on criteria set by the observer when the training set is built .",
    "galaxies were removed if they were classified by eye as `` uncertain '' or had fits of poor quality , for example if a nearby bright object contaminated the image . that left a training set of 415 galaxies , from all the clusters and spanning the whole range of magnitudes , although with fewer galaxies at the faint end of the distribution after the removal of the `` uncertain '' class .",
    "the automated classification of the galaxies was made using the seven - dimensional space defined by the probabilities derived from the @xmath47 test ( 3 values , one for each fit ) , from the trend statistics ( 3 values again ) , and by the f814w magnitude .",
    "each galaxy was selected and assigned the same classification ( bulge , disk , or hybrid ) as its nearest neighbor in this parameter space .",
    "this approach was implemented because of its potential for rejecting un - physical fits .",
    "for example , it would be possible to enforce a tendency to reject very low surface brightness bulge components if a reasonable disk was already present .",
    "in fact , the nearest neighbor procedure is very general . in the end",
    "we chose not to use any of the physical parameters of the galaxies ( size , surface brightness ) except apparent magnitude in the automated classification .",
    "an optimization procedure was used to determine the normalization of the axes of the parameter space which produced the largest success rate for the training set where success is defined as agreement of the automated classifier with the visually - selected class .",
    "the success rate is not sensitive to the exact values of the normalization factors and we set them to a ratio of of 2:4:1 for the @xmath47 , trend statistics , and magnitude , respectively . with these values ,",
    "the success rate for the computer based classification of the galaxies from the training set is 85% .",
    "the discrepancies occur for the fainter galaxies , or for the ones for which a single component model and the hybrid model were almost identical . in the former case",
    ", there will be a cut off in magnitude eliminating these uncertain classifications . in the latter ,",
    "we notice that the classification process would select the combined model when the observer would prefer the single component one , but since the morphological parameters for both models are very similar in such cases , the effect is very minor .    for each cluster ,",
    "a sample of the galaxies that had not been visually classified were examined to verify the automated classification procedure .",
    "no major disagreements were noticed , but the rate of error with magnitude rises significantly above f814w(ab)=23 .",
    "this reinforces the faint limit of 23 established by observing at what point many galaxy types were `` uncertain '' .",
    "there is also an increase of the error rate at the bright end of the distribution .",
    "this effect is caused by the large resolved structures in these luminous galaxies , which are fitted with less efficiency .",
    "however , these bright galaxies are not numerous and are not likely to be at cluster redshifts .",
    "thus , the increase of errors at the two ends of the magnitude distribution will not significantly affect the results .",
    "the distributions of morphological parameters in our catalogs are robust in the sense that they depend only weakly on the exact method that is used to facilitate the classification .",
    "for example , we could have used a much more direct method of choosing the best fit : accept the fit which produced the smallest value of @xmath46 .",
    "if this had been done then we would have produced the same classification as our nearest - neighbor procedure for 78.4% of the training set galaxies or the same classification as our visual classes for 78.9% of the galaxies . as noted , we chose not to do this because we could produce a slightly higher success rate ( 85% ) with the nearest - neighbor method and we could reject some , not all , `` un - physical '' best - fit models .",
    "the relationship between the classification procedure we used and the statistics of the fit is made more clear by examining how many real disagreements exist between the statistics of the fit and our ultimate classification .",
    "a real disagreement is produced when our classification is rejected by the f - test in favor of a classification whose fit is better from a statistical point of view . using this definition",
    "only 2.9% of our training set galaxies represent disagreements with the statistics in the sense that our automated classification chooses a model whose fit is worse than the best - fit model at the 95% confidence level .",
    "a comparison of the visual classification and the statistics yields an identical rate of agreement .",
    "in other words , the choices made in our classification are supported by the statistics of the fits in the overwhelming majority of cases .",
    "the catalog contains a total of 1642 galaxies .",
    "cluster ms1358 has 672 galaxies , ms1621 has 258 , ms0016 has 331 and ms1054 has 381 .",
    "tables [ tab0016 ] , [ tab1054 ] , [ tab1358 ] and [ tab1621 ] present example of the results of the modeling and classification ( the full tables are available only on - line ) . the name of the galaxy in column ( 1 ) contains the following information : name of the exposure , chip where the galaxy was found , @xmath55 and @xmath56 pixel coordinates on that chip . an asterisk put after the name indicates that the galaxy has been statistically identified as a field galaxy . columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the coordinates of each galaxy .",
    "the observed magnitudes are given in column ( 4 ) , and are the magnitudes in the reddest filter for each galaxy , f814w .",
    "color is given in column ( 5 ) and corresponds to f814w - f555w for clusters ms0016 and ms1621 , f814w - f606w for ms1054 and exposures a through i , l and m of ms1358 .",
    "exposures j and k of ms1358 are f814w - f450w .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "note that the magnitudes are calculated from the best - fit model parameters and are thus effectively integrated to infinite radius . in the next column",
    "( except for ms1054 ) are presented the redshift of the galaxies for which they were available @xcite .",
    "the last five columns of the table present the morphologic parameters . in column",
    "( 6 ) is @xmath1 , which is the ratio of light in the bulge component of the galaxy and the total luminosity .",
    "if @xmath57 , the galaxy is a pure disk , and the last four columns present the properties of this disk , and if @xmath58 columns ( 7 ) through ( 10 ) list the quantitative description of this bulge . finally , every galaxy with @xmath59 is represented by two lines in the table .",
    "the first line gives its disk properties , and the second line lists the bulge parameters . in column ( 7 ) , @xmath60 is the central surface brightness , the scale length is h in ( 8) , ar is the axial ratio ( the ratio of the length of the minor axis to the major axis of the galaxy ) and is presented in column ( 9 ) , and the last column gives the position angle of the galaxy . the position angle is the angle between the major axis of the ellipse and the @xmath55 pixel coordinate axis on the original images .",
    "the errors presented in columns ( 8) and ( 9 ) are mostly reliable for the single component models , and are given in the hybrid model case to indicate the average precision of the measurements .",
    "after the fit has converged its parameters represent our best estimate of the shape of the galaxy luminosity profile . given that shape , the normalization of the model is determined by    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the observed counts in the @xmath63 pixel and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the values of the model and the noise at that pixel .",
    "the normalization @xmath66 is the total number of counts in the model if @xmath67 .",
    "this relation can be derived by minimizing @xmath46 under the assumption that the model is represented by the product of a shape ( the @xmath68 s ) and a normalizing factor .    as described earlier ,",
    "the original image is rotated , subtracted and the difference image is clipped at @xmath43 to create an asymmetric image composed of only the significant positive departures from symmetry .",
    "this image is subtracted from the original image .",
    "statistically , there is some flux removed from the image even if it is symmetric because of the noise in the image .",
    "the size of the effect depends on the signal - to - noise ratio and the most severe effect occurs at the background limit ( that is , when background noise from sky and read - noise is the dominant noise source ) .",
    "given a gaussian background noise distribution with a specific root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "deviation or @xmath44 the clipping will leave behind 2.25% of the pixels and these will carry , on average , a signal of 0.054 times @xmath44 ( background ) for each pixel in the aperture .",
    "this signal is subtracted from the image and thus produces a bias in the measured flux .",
    "this bias is in the sense of producing less flux in the symmetric image compared to the original image .",
    "the size of the effect depends strongly on the size of the photometric aperture and we estimate the size of the effect using values of signal and noise from our actual data for ms1358 where the galaxies are larger than in the more distant clusters .",
    "the larger size translates into larger photometric apertures and thus more background noise and a larger value of the potential bias . for the f814w ( i - band",
    ") images in ms1358 we compute a bias of about 3.5% at @xmath69 using an aperture with a diameter of 3 arcseconds ( the bias would be 6% at the limit of @xmath70 or 1.4% at @xmath71 ) . however , as noted above , aperture photometry is not used to normalize our models .",
    "the approach we use optimizes the signal - to - noise ratio by weighting the pixels according to how much galaxy signal they contain .",
    "this reduces the effective number of pixels that contribute to the noise therefore it also reduces the size of the bias . for a disk galaxy at @xmath69 with a scale length of 0.5 arcseconds",
    "the bias is reduced by a factor of 0.57 to about 2% and for scale lengths of 0.25 and 0.10 arcseconds the bias is reduced to 0.8% and 0.2% respectively . for bulge galaxies of a given half - light radius the effect is small because the galaxies are more compact than disks .",
    "for example , at @xmath69 a bulge with half - light radius of 0.5 arcseconds will have a bias estimated to be 0.5% .",
    "so for typical galaxies the effect is small .",
    "still , the existence of the bias and its variation with galaxy size is an effect to note with caution . for faint large galaxies ( @xmath72 arcsecond )",
    "the effect could still be 3 - 4% .",
    "but the effect is small in ms1358 and smaller still for our more distant clusters .",
    "simulations of several thousand galaxies ( typically 250 galaxies per run ) were done to see if we could detect any bias in the fitting of symmetrized images compared to fitting the original images .",
    "the exercise highlighted the reason that the symmetrizing process was important : fits ( particularly two - component fits ) to the original images are plagued with problems due to neighboring stars and galaxies .",
    "for this reason , the results that follow were computed after excluding 5 - 10% of the poorest fits . for disk galaxies with simulated scale lengths ( @xmath73 ) of 0.5 arcseconds and magnitudes of @xmath70 we recovered values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 from the original images and @xmath76 and @xmath77 from the symmetrized images .",
    "the quoted errors are the dispersions in the recovered values . at @xmath70 and @xmath78",
    "arcseconds these galaxies have poor signal - to - noise ratio which explains their large errors . for moderate size disks with @xmath79 arcseconds we recovered @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath83 from the original and symmetrized images .",
    "for very small disks ( @xmath84 arcsceonds ) at @xmath70 we recovered values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the original and symmetrized images .",
    "any bias due to the symmetrizing process is very small compared to the other sources of error , for example crowding by neighbors , sky subtraction , psf uncertainty , and centering errors .",
    "if the signal - to - noise ratios of the two images used to produce colors differ significantly from one another , it would be possible to produce a color bias from the symmetrizing procedure .",
    "this possibility was examined with the particular data from this paper and was found to be at roughly the 0.5% level when 3 arcsecond diameter apertures were used .",
    "the color bias would be smaller in our fitting procedure as noted above and is thus a negligible source of error .",
    "the referee for this paper made the interesting suggestion that it might be possible to produce an artificial reddening of galaxies if blue star - forming regions which were distributed asymmetrically were removed by the symmetrizing process .",
    "clearly the effect would be expected to be largest at low redshift where the regions are best resolved .",
    "the most direct way to address this issue is to perform aperture photometry ( thus bypassing any dependence on the model - fitting process ) on the original images and compare that photometry to the same measurements on the symmetrized images .",
    "we did this with 95 of the larger disk - dominated galaxies in the field of ms1358 without regard for whether these had been classified as cluster members or field galaxies .",
    "it was found that the offset in the mean color between the original images and the symmetrized images in ms1358 was @xmath89 magnitudes in f814w - f606w .",
    "if a single outlier was removed then the offset became statistically significant ( @xmath90 magnitudes ) .",
    "if the offset were being produced by the removal of star - forming regions by the symmetrizing process then blue galaxies would be expected to show a stronger effect than red galaxies .",
    "a comparison of the blue and red halves of the sample yielded offsets of @xmath91 and @xmath92 magnitudes respectively .",
    "so the effect is small and is not significantly larger for the blue galaxies which should be forming stars more vigorously .",
    "a small set of large disk galaxies is available in ms1358 with f450w and f814w observations and this set should be more sensitive to the effect of star - forming regions because of the bluer filter measurement . for this set of 15 galaxies",
    "we find a reddening of @xmath93 magnitudes ( @xmath94 if the worst outlier is removed ) .",
    "again , this fails to provide support for the suggestion that the symmetrizing process is biasing the colors of galaxies by removing star - forming regions .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a visual inspection of images and symmetrized images along with the fit residuals for 50 of the larger galaxies in both ms1358 and ms1054 .",
    "there are very few cases where there the effect of the symmetrizing process might plausibly produce a significant change in the structure and color of the galaxies .",
    "the errors on single - component models ( bulge or disk ) are given as output from the fitting software and are generally reliable ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "errors on multi - component fits suffer from the correlation of errors in the bulge and disk components which are assumed to be concentric .",
    "because of these error correlations the errors from the fitting software may not be reliable when fitting multi - component models .",
    "@xcite used fits to multiple observations of the same galaxies to estimate the errors in the morphological analysis .",
    "the evaluation of the errors can be confirmed through simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the present paper ,",
    "several hundred simulations of galaxies spanning the range of morphological parameters and signal - to - noise ratios were done .",
    "these confirm that the scatter from all sources of random error for galaxies of the size and surface brightness that this paper deals with are typically in the range of 10% in the scale length or half - light radius and 10 - 20% in surface brightness .",
    "the errors can be worse for large , low - surface brightness galaxies where the detection is also problematic .",
    "the galaxy types are defined as follows : disk galaxies are taken to be the ones with @xmath95 , and bulges those for which @xmath96 . the galaxies with ratios in the range of 0.4 to 0.8",
    "are said to be intermediate .",
    "this class is likely to include all of the s0 galaxies , as well as other bulge dominated structures that still possess a disk ( early type sa galaxies , for example ) .",
    "the comparison between these results and other work should therefore be done cautiously . but as will be shown in the next paragraphs , the classification still allows one to recreate classical results as accurately as a visual classification with hubble type classes would do .",
    "a small correction based on the individual colors of the disk and bulge components is applied to the @xmath1 values to reduce them to rest - frame @xmath97-band .",
    "one test of the reliability of these galaxy classifications is an examination of the color - magnitude relation .",
    "bulge galaxies should be predominantly red and exhibit a tight relation .",
    "disk - dominated galaxies would be expected to show a wider dispersion in color .",
    "figure [ cmag ] presents the color - magnitude relations in the observed planes for the four clusters ( of course some field galaxies will also be present in these fields ) .",
    "as expected , the distribution of colors differs between galaxies defined as bulges and those defined as later type .",
    "the bulges tend to form a tighter sequence at redder colors than the later types , which cover a wide range in color .",
    "this is especially clear for clusters ms1358 and ms1054 where the observed galaxies are concentrated in the center of the clusters ( cf .",
    "figure [ radec ] ) .",
    "ms1054 shows a high concentration of faint blue disks , and an apparent gap in color between the red sequence and this group of galaxies .",
    "this suggests that there might be some galaxy groups in the field that are unrelated to ms1054 or sub - clustering in ms1054 itself to produce that bimodal distribution .",
    "it has been shown using x - ray maps produced by _",
    "rosat _ and _ chandra _ that there is sub - clustering in ms1054 @xcite . to investigate the possibility that the bimodal distribution in the color - magnitude plane is caused by different groups",
    "being observed , the spatial distribution of the galaxies in ms1054 was examined .",
    "looking at figure [ cmag ] , it appears that there are two distinct structures , with colors ( f606w - f814w ) larger and smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ c1054 ] shows the spatial distribution of these two subsets on the bottom two panels , respectively .",
    "as expected , the reddest galaxies ( those with ( f606w - f814w)@xmath98 ) are more concentrated towards the center of the cluster as a result of the morphology - density relation .",
    "we then expect the bluer galaxies to be distributed around that central concentration .",
    "this is what is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ c1054 ] .",
    "the distribution appears uniform and not to correlate with the two clumps observed in the x - ray .",
    "the central position of these concentrations , as given in @xcite , are shown on the bottom panel of figure [ c1054 ] as the open stars .",
    "the apparent presence of a concentration of blue disks north and west of the center in that plot is directly related to the spatial distribution of the observations made , as seen in figure [ radec ] . without redshifts to confirm the membership of these galaxies to the cluster , we will assume that we are only sampling a different population of the cluster by observing at outer radii and that these galaxies legitimately belong to the cluster .",
    "note that a statistical correction will be made for field galaxy contamination .",
    "another way of verifying the results of the classification , and the validity of the morphology classes , is to look at the morphology - clustercentric radius relation .",
    "it has been shown that a radial dependence of galaxy morphology inside clusters exists @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued @xcite that instead of projected radius , local density should be used as the independent variable , since it takes account of any sub - clustering or irregularities in the distribution of galaxies in the cluster , which was supported by the observation of a universal relation in local clusters between morphology and density .",
    "recently , a debate has been made as to which of the two relations is more fundamental ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since we are looking at the morphology - radius only to confirm the validity of our classification , we will not present the morphology - density as well , nor try to answer that question .    the morphology - radius relation for our four clusters",
    "is presented in figure [ morphrad ] . in all cases , but to various extent , the expected trends are observed : an increase in the disk population with radius , and a decrease in the number of intermediate and bulge galaxies .",
    "rest - frame values are calculated to allow for comparison between clusters .",
    "the observed f814w(ab ) magnitudes are k - corrected using the galaxy color to choose among the spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) of @xcite .",
    "note that ab magnitudes are used throughout .",
    "the procedure used , including the convolution of filter bands with the seds is described in @xcite .",
    "the same tables and procedures used in that work were used here .",
    "the chosen sed is then used to determine the correction from the observed wavelength to rest - frame @xmath99-band and used together with the systemic redshift of the cluster to determine rest - frame @xmath99 absolute magnitude .",
    "the various colors ( f814w - f606w , f814w - f555w , f814w - f450w ) are transformed into rest - frame @xmath100 ( thereafter , @xmath101 ) using the same sed - choosing procedure .",
    "for the galaxies that were assigned a hybrid model , k - corrections are obtained separately for the bulge and the disk from the color of each individual component .",
    "finally , disk scale - lengths and bulge half - light radii are computed in units of kpc and surface brightnesses with restframe @xmath99 magnitudes .",
    "all rest - frame values were calculated using @xmath22 km sec@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "redshifts are available for only @xmath102 of the galaxies , so in order to have the largest sample possible , another means of defining cluster membership must be used .",
    "a statistical correction for field galaxy contamination was applied to identify probable cluster members .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that such a correction works only in the case where the level of actual field galaxy contamination is typical , in a statistical sense .",
    "if there were groups or clusters of galaxies in the same field as the x - ray identified clusters but at a different redshift , then this process would fail to weed them out .    to perform this correction ,",
    "images of other randomly - selected fields obtained with wfpc2 were retrieved .",
    "they include 23 frames from the groth strip and 12 frames from the _ canada - france redshift survey _ @xcite .",
    "the images were reduced , processed , and their galaxies were fitted and classified in exactly the same manner as the cluster images . for a given pair of filters ,",
    "the same number of frames from the field were processed as for the cluster sample ; the use of a single frame to correct all the data could introduce systematic errors . in order to avoid such errors",
    ", the subset of field galaxies used to do the correction was randomly selected and changed for each cluster frame .",
    "it is necessary in the field correction procedure to account for the different density of sources on the frames .",
    "the field galaxies are assumed to be uniformly distributed whereas the cluster galaxies are concentrated toward the cluster center . on the scale of an individual hst pointing the distribution of galaxies appears to be clumpy rather than obeying a clear radial density gradient and",
    "this clumpiness varies from cluster to cluster .",
    "it was decided that the scale represented by a single hst pointing ( there are 5 or more in each cluster ) was sufficient to characterize the local density for the purpose of doing he field correction and this had the advantage of avoiding the assumption of a very regular galaxy distribution which is only true in an average sense .",
    "each pointing was corrected individually .",
    "the randomly selected galaxies for a given field were `` matched '' with the cluster galaxies .",
    "the cluster galaxy that most closely resembles each field galaxy is marked as a `` statistically identified field galaxy '' and removed from the cluster sample .",
    "the parameters used to do that matching are the observed magnitude , the color , and the @xmath1 ratio .",
    "the best match was defined using the same type of procedure as applied for the classification .",
    "a space was constructed and the nearest neighbor of each field galaxy in the cluster was removed .",
    "clusters ms1358 , ms1621 and ms0016 were corrected up to a magnitude of @xmath103 , and ms1054 up to @xmath104 .",
    "the color - magnitude relation is used in figure [ fieldcorr ] to illustrate the effect of the field galaxy contamination correction .",
    "the red bulge sequence is relatively un - modified and many of the galaxies off the sequence are identified statistically as interlopers from the field . for ms1358 , there was a large number of galaxies redder than the reddest ellipticals in the core of the cluster , which were believed to be either higher redshift background galaxies or very dusty foreground galaxies .",
    "the correction identifies most of them as field galaxies .",
    "in ms1054 , as discussed in  [ sectioncmag ] , there are two groups visible in the color - magnitude diagram , one which lies in the bluer region of the plot ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ cmag ] ) .",
    "that `` blue group '' of galaxies is largely removed by the statistical correction process .",
    "another means of verifying the results of the field galaxy correction is to compare the sample of field galaxies used to do the correction to the ones rejected from the cluster frames .",
    "this comparison is done using one of the parameters that remained free during the matching process : the disk scale length .",
    "the distribution of the sizes from the two samples were compared using a kolmogoroff - smirnoff test with the result that the hypothesis that the two samples of scale lengths are drawn from the same distribution can not be rejected at the 5% level ( the k - s probability was 7% ) .",
    "this indicates that the galaxies in the cluster field that are designated as field galaxies are similar to the field galaxies used to do the corrections .",
    "we have forced them to be similar in terms of color , magnitude , and bulge - to - total luminosity and , after doing so , we find that the scale length distributions are not distinguishable .",
    "it is impossible to do a reasonable comparison of the number counts of galaxies between the four clusters directly because the clusters vary in mass and because the completeness and the radial coverage of the sampling varies enormously from cluster to cluster ( as shown in figure [ radec ] ) . in order to correct for this problem ,",
    "a normalization factor was computed based on the fraction of cluster mass that was sampled by the fields observed in the present study .",
    "the calculations take into account the mass of each cluster , the field of view , and the density profile of the clusters , and are made under the assumption that the cluster mass is a good predictor of the total number of galaxies it contains . in other words , we are assuming that the efficiency of galaxy formation is identical in these four clusters .",
    "further , we implicitly assume that the efficiency of production of each galaxy type is constant across clusters .    in a study based on the cnoc clusters ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the galaxy number density profile is proportional to the cluster mass profile , at least over a given range in radius ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "therefore , by selecting an appropriate density profile and integrating it over the field of view , a good estimate of the mass that has been sampled can be made .",
    "this can be converted into an expected number of galaxies under the assumptions stated above . in the study by @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the function @xmath106 is adequate to describe the mass distribution of 14 of the 16 cnoc clusters , including the three studied here ( this model is similar to the one presented by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it will be used to represent the three - dimensional spatial density profile of the clusters , with a value for the scale radius , @xmath107 , of 0.27 as suggested by the best fits of @xcite .    to compute the normalization factor , the assumption that the clusters are spheres containing their galaxies within @xmath108",
    "first , @xmath109 was integrated to project it in the plane .",
    "this produces @xmath110 , the surface density which is then normalized by the integral of @xmath109 over the whole sphere .",
    "this normalized surface density is then integrated over the entire field of view of the observations .",
    "the fraction of the cluster observed is then known , and multiplying it by the cluster mass ( as presented in table [ tab1 ] ) gives the normalization factor that we seek .",
    "the results are sensitive to the cluster masses .",
    "estimates of the mass of ms1054 have been made using various techniques : x - ray luminosity @xcite , weak lensing @xcite , and observed velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the value calculated with this last technique is the one adopted here , since it is very similar to that used to evaluate the masses of the cnoc clusters @xcite .",
    "the values of the normalization factor are presented in table [ tabnorm ] .      in this section",
    ", the distribution of disk surface brightnesses is investigated in the four clusters .",
    "it is important to note that these galaxies are identified as `` disk '' galaxies solely on the basis of the light profiles , in the sense that exponential profiles provide better representations of their luminosity distributions than are provided by de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "figure [ hdsb ] shows the relationship between the scale length and the rest - frame b - band central surface brightness of the disks in those galaxies with @xmath111 and with magnitudes brighter than f814w(ab)=22.5 ( 23.0 for ms1054 ) . at each cluster redshift ,",
    "the cutoff in observed magnitude translates into a cutoff in luminosity ( modified slightly by variation of the k - correction with color ) .",
    "disk central surface brightness ( @xmath112 ) depends on both disk scale length ( @xmath113 ) and absolute b magnitude ( @xmath114 ) as : @xmath115 the dotted lines represent these limiting luminosities in terms of size and surface brightness . figure [ hdsb ] also indicates on each frame the magnitude cutoff for ms1054 .",
    "the analysis of the sensitivity of our source detection procedure to disk galaxies shows that the probability of detecting pure disk galaxies in all of the clusters is high ( @xmath116 ) brighter than the nominal limiting magnitudes only for those galaxies with scale lengths smaller than 2.0 kiloparsecs in all clusters .",
    "therefore the region of the diagrams shown in figure [ hdsb ] to the left of the magnitude selection lines and with scale lengths smaller than 2.0 kpc is fairly sampled in all of the clusters .",
    "that is , fair comparisons of the size - surface brightness distributions can be made only in this region . in practice",
    "we limit our consideration to disk galaxies with @xmath5 kpc .",
    "the most striking feature of figure [ hdsb ] is the increase with redshift in the number of small ( @xmath5 kpc ) , high surface brightness disk galaxies .",
    "this effect could be produced in a number of ways .",
    "this could be an actual evolutionary effect .",
    "or it could be that the populations of disk galaxies in all of the clusters are similar but that the sampling rate of the population in ms1054 is much higher than in the other clusters so that the observed number is larger although the underlying distributions are identical . if the clusters do not represent a family with a common evolutionary history then the difference in the number of small disk galaxies may not be an evolutionary effect but merely an indication of the range of characteristics of the galaxy populations in rich clusters .    in the next section",
    ", an attempt will be made to address the issue of the different sampling rates in the four clusters by normalizing the counts on the basis of the sampled mass in each observation .",
    "this will be based on the conjecture that disk galaxy formation is equally efficient in all of these clusters .",
    "another way of saying this is that a given quantity of total mass ( dark plus baryonic ) will produce a given quantity of disk galaxy mass .",
    "the uncertainty of this conjecture is obvious and the fact that the disk galaxy populations may be in different phases of their evolution in different clusters is a further caveat .",
    "nevertheless , we will proceed to investigate the difference in the properties of these galaxies under the assumptions that we have stated above .",
    "the simplest pair of models to describe the change in the size - surface brightness distribution is a ) a shift in size of the entire distribution with no change in surface brightness , and b ) a shift in surface brightness of the population with no change in size .",
    "pure size evolution of disk galaxies ( by definition with no change in surface brightness ) is a way to model changes in the statistical distributions that are observed in these samples . but",
    "this model is difficult to link in a simple way to a physical scenario for the evolution of individual galaxies because some change in star formation rate is likely to occur over time and passive evolution of the stellar population will change the disk surface brightness even if the star formation rate is maintained a some constant level .",
    "it is conceivable that a changing star - formation rate could balance an aging population that is fading but it seems unlikely because it would require an interesting degree of fine - tuning if it were to be observed over a population of galaxies .    in general",
    ", evolving disks are expected to grow in size as they add more mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present case",
    "we observe many small galaxies at a given central surface brightness in ms1054 at @xmath16 which are absent in the lower redshift clusters .",
    "the way for them to escape detection in these lower redshift clusters is for them to evolve to smaller sizes ( at a given surface brightness ) as time moves forward .",
    "this is directly contrary to a simple model of disk growth .",
    "therefore , we have reason to be skeptical of the pure size evolution as a physical model for evolution for individual galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we will test pure size evolution as a model for the evolution of the distributions of size and central surface brightness .    to do this test ,",
    "the size distribution of each cluster is shifted ( in size only ) until the `` equivalent expected number '' of galaxies above the selection line is the same as the observations of ms1054 .",
    "this means that the ratio of observed numbers of galaxies above the selection line is equal to the ratio of the normalizing factors which correct for cluster mass and the spatial coverage of the observations , as calculated in  4.2.2 ( the `` equivalent expected number '' for each cluster is given in column 2 of table [ tablum ] ) . in other words , the whole galaxy sample for a given cluster",
    "is shifted in size until the expected number of galaxies appears in the region of the size - surface brightness plane where the small bright disks are found .",
    "this region is the one represented in figure [ hdsb ] .",
    "the shifts in the disk scale length distributions required are given in the third column of table [ tablum ] .",
    "a problem with this test appears immediately : a shift in size is unable to provide the expected number of small bright disks for ms1358 and ms0016 .",
    "we can only shift the distributions in size until the selection line due to limiting magnitude in each cluster coincides with the corresponding selection line in ms1054 . beyond this shift",
    "we have no sensitivity to smaller galaxies in ms1358 , ms1621 , and ms0016 .",
    "the shift given in table [ tablum ] is the shift that gives the largest number of small bright disks and is roughly the largest shift we can do for ms1358 and ms0016 .",
    "this problem is not due to the poorer sampling of these clusters since the normalization technique used to calculate the expected numbers removes the effects of the different areas sampled .",
    "the shifted distributions are plotted in figure [ delh ] . in that plot , the lines are the same as in figure [ hdsb ] , i.e. , the magnitude cutoff of ms1054 and the 2 kpc scale length cut off .",
    "the limiting size at which detection of disk galaxies is complete varies from cluster to cluster as given above . at this limiting size",
    "there is a limiting central surface brightness imposed by the magnitude limit .",
    "the region of the size - surface brightness plane that is complete for all of the clusters has a limiting size of 2.0 kpc and and at this scale length each cluster has its own limiting surface brightness . for ms1358 , ms1621 , ms0016 , and ms1054 this limiting surface brightness is roughly 22.6 , 21.8 , 21.1 , and 20.3 respectively .",
    "thus we can shift each cluster population by , at most , the difference between its limiting surface brightness at 2 kpc and that of ms1054 .",
    "if we shift it more than this amount then we are no longer comparing complete regions of the size - surface brightness plane .",
    "the simplest model that is suggested by these data is a uniform change in surface brightness experienced by the entire disk galaxy population . to test this model the population",
    "is shifted in surface brightness only , subject to the constraint above , namely , that we are careful to compare only well - sampled regions of the size - surface brightness plane .",
    "the shift produces an acceptable model when the observed number in the well - sampled region of the clusters agree with the expected number of galaxies predicted from the ms1054 data using the mass normalization to account for cluster mass and variation of our sampling .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ delsb ] .",
    "the 95% confidence intervals for these shifts were estimated using procedures described by @xcite .",
    "the number of disks in the region where they can confidently be compared ( scale length smaller that 2 kpc and surface brightness high enough to be detected in ms1054 ) is different in ms1358 and ms1054 at greater than the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "the galaxy populations differ by more than the difference in sampled mass would indicate .",
    "the shifts that are required in order to bring the number of observed galaxies in our comparison region into line with the number predicted by the mass normalization factor ( together with the number in ms1054 ) are given in table [ tablum ] .",
    "at the 95% confidence level only ms1358 differs , to a degree that is statistically significant , from ms1054 although the best - fit shifts in surface brightness are always non - zero .",
    "the comparison of ms1358 and ms1054 indicates that a shift of @xmath117 magnitudes ( 95% confidence level ) in surface brightness produces agreement in the number of small disks and , furthermore , the median scale lengths and dispersion in the resultant samples agree reasonably well ( the values are shown in table [ tablum ] ) .",
    "the statistics for the other clusters are poor because of small numbers of galaxies .",
    "a simple model such as pure evolution of the disk population in surface brightness is unlikely to provide a complete explanation of the observations .",
    "nevertheless , with the statistics in hand on these four clusters , such a model explains the main features of the size - surface brightness distributions of small disks in these four clusters .",
    "in particular , it models the discrepancy in the small disk population between ms1358 at @xmath7 and ms1054 at @xmath16 .    another way of estimating the apparent change in surface brightness of these galaxy populations is by visual examination of the upper - left envelope to the distribution in the plane of size and surface brightness .",
    "this envelope , where the maximum scale length at a given surface brightness increases with fainter surface brightness may be explained by the higher angular momentum of low surface brightness galaxies , which results in larger disk sizes for a given mass @xcite .",
    "since the existence of this envelope is , plausibly , an intrinsic physical property of the galaxies , tracking it through the different clusters allows one to get an estimate of the luminosity evolution of the galaxies . on figure [ env_minmax ]",
    "are traced both the limiting magnitude of each cluster and the estimated position of the upper envelope , represented by constant magnitude lines on each frame .",
    "both upper and lower limits for this upper envelope are plotted .",
    "this time , the @xmath118 represent the shift between the upper envelope of each cluster and the one of ms1054 .",
    "the shifts are simply estimated by eye .",
    "the values are given in the last column of table [ tablum ] .",
    "the ranges just overlap with those previously calculated in the cases of ms0016 and ms1621 , but are somewhat smaller for ms1358 .",
    "there is reasonable agreement of this result with the previous estimation of the surface - brightness evolution that used a more rigorous statistical procedure .    in summary , a simple model of",
    "the change in the distribution of small disk properties in the plane of size and surface brightness is pure surface - brightness evolution .",
    "if interpreted physically this implies a brightening of @xmath119 magnitudes in the b band over the range @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "the results of the preceding sections raises the question of whether we could be making the error of classifying galaxies as disks when they are actually bulges .",
    "the frequency of such errors might vary with redshift producing a spurious population of small disk galaxies at high redshift . in figure [ diskfit ]",
    "we show that we can distinguish reliably between disk and bulge models even for very small and faint galaxies in the field of ms1054 .    in order to quantify our success rates at distinguishing bulges and disks",
    "we simulated galaxies including all sources of error and subjected them to the end - to - end fitting and classification process .",
    "note that the fits to actual data were done by simultaneously fitting the images in two filters whereas these simulations were done using only a single image .",
    "the magnitude scales were accurate so that the signal - to - noise was reproduced exactly for the i - band images in the simulations .",
    "this means that our simulations actually had lower signal - to - noise ratios than the two - filter fits that were used for the real data .",
    "therefore , these simulations produce results that are lower quality than our actual fits .",
    "this simplified the simulation procedures and is sufficient to illustrate the effectiveness of the fitting process .",
    "the resolution in physical units is lowest in ms1054 .",
    "simulations were done of 800 disks with a scale length of 0.10 arcseconds and these galaxies were added to actual ms1054 images in order to include the effects of neighbors and crowding .",
    "the galaxies went through the same detection and symmetrizing processes as the real data .",
    "uncertainties in the point - spread function and sky level were effectively included .",
    "the fits were processed through the automated classification procedure .",
    "pure disk galaxy models with true ( simulated ) scale lengths of 0.1 arcseconds and @xmath70 were classified as pure disks in 90.2% of the cases . in 91.8% of the cases",
    "the disk parameters were recovered effectively with the galaxy classified as either pure disk or bulge - plus - disk . in the latter case",
    "this implies a negligible bulge component although the class chosen was bulge - plus - disk . in 3.4% of the cases the simulated disks were classified as pure bulges . in the remaining 4.8% of the cases",
    "the fits failed to converge to a reasonable result .",
    "the mis - classification as disks of galaxies that are actually bulges is a serious concern .",
    "we simulated and fit approximately 800 pure bulge galaxies with half - light radii @xmath120 arcseconds and @xmath70 .",
    "this corresponds to the same half - light radius as a pure disk with scale length of 0.1 arcseconds .",
    "we claim success ( recovery as a pure bulge in 73% of the cases or recovery as a bulge - dominated bulge - plus - disk galaxy where the bulge parameters were well - determined in 23.9% of the cases ) in a 96.9% of the cases .",
    "our end - to - end simulations mistakenly classified a pure bulge as a disk in 1.3% of the cases .",
    "the remaining 1.8% were fits which failed to converge .",
    "these simulations also yield estimates of the errors on our fitted parameters by comparing the distributions of recovered parameter values to the known input values .",
    "the errors do not decrease rapidly with increasing signal- to - noise ratio indicating that they are dominated by small systematic errors such as errors in the point - spread function , sky level estimate , galaxy centering , and other details of the processing procedure .",
    "for the smallest galaxies ( half - light radius @xmath121 arcseconds ) at @xmath70 the dispersion in both recovered size and magnitude hover around 10% and grow to about 15% as the size doubles at a fixed luminosity . as the half - light radius approaches 1 arcsecond the dispersion in recovered size approaches 30% and the error in brightness is about 0.35 magnitudes .",
    "there are not many galaxies this large in the catalog .",
    "systematic errors are seen as failures of the mean recovered values to converge on the true value even for large sample sizes but these systematics are always less than the dispersions and the worst cases are for small galaxies where the systematics can be 50 - 60% as large as the random errors . for the majority of galaxies in our catalog the total errors in size and brightness parameters are in the range of 10% for smaller galaxies and 20% or less for most of the catalog galaxies .    in summary",
    ", these results indicate that we can reliably distinguish between bulges and disks near the magnitude limit of our observations and at very small galaxy sizes where the interesting results of our study fall .",
    "the cluster ms1054 apparently contains a population of small , high - surface brightness disk - like galaxies that are not seen in the other three clusters at lower redshift .",
    "these galaxies are referred to as `` disks '' because they are better fit by an exponential profile than by a de vaucouleurs @xmath45 law .",
    "these galaxies are reminiscent of the high - surface brightness field `` disk '' populations detected by @xcite , and @xcite . under the assumption that the observed differences in the small disk - galaxy populations in these four clusters are due to evolution , then pure surface brightness evolution describes the observations somewhat better than pure size evolution . neither model is perfect and our ability to distinguish between them is limited by the small numbers of galaxies involved in the comparison .",
    "more complex models have not been investigated .    using two independent techniques ,",
    "the luminosity enhancement of the disk galaxies was estimated .",
    "the method based on the detection of the upper limit of the distribution of galaxies in the size - surface brightness plane is free of any assumptions on the mass and population of the cluster .",
    "it provides a range of values for the shift in surface brightness observed in the galaxy population from cluster to cluster .",
    "the other technique , based on the cluster mass normalization factors , gives another estimate for each cluster .",
    "the agreement between the results of the two techniques is encouraging in terms of the validity of the counts normalization method . to further test it ,",
    "larger samples would be required such that statistics could be made with larger number . as it was seen with these clusters ,",
    "the larger the data set , the easier it is to get accurate results when trying to find the `` equivalent expected number '' of galaxies , as done in section [ analysis ] .",
    "one must also keep in mind the assumptions that were made , mainly that the number of disks observed in a cluster is directly proportional to the total mass of the cluster , and that the galaxy number density profile is proportional to the mass profile . even though this second assumption is supported by previous work @xcite ,",
    "the first one albeit reasonable has yet to be proven .    because of all the assumptions made , the result on the luminosity evolution of the galaxies needs to be considered carefully , in the context of previous work .",
    "@xcite have shown that disk galaxies , both in the field and in clusters , have a mean surface brightness increased by @xmath122 magnitude at @xmath28 compared to local clusters .",
    "similar conclusions have also been reached in other works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied the population of small bright disks and showed that this rapidly - evolving population has sizes and velocity widths typical of irregular galaxies in the local universe but are typically @xmath123 magnitudes more luminous than local irregulars .",
    "the most obvious caveat accompanying our conclusions about the evolution of small disk galaxies is that the cluster membership of these galaxies is uncertain .",
    "redshifts are not available for all galaxies .",
    "corrections for field galaxy contamination have been made but these corrections apply only to typical fields and it may be that there are atypical levels of contamination by non - cluster members .",
    "in other words , we may be seeing an effect that is not only unrelated to the cluster environment but is erroneous because the cluster redshifts have been assumed for all cluster `` members '' and these redshifts would be incorrect if membership were incorrectly assigned .",
    "redshifts would make these conclusions far more secure .    to further rule out the possibility that the small bright disks observed in ms1054 are contaminants , their spatial distribution is observed .",
    "the small bright disks are not concentrated in any region of the cluster , as evidenced by figure [ radec1054 ] , such as it would be expected if they were members of a group projected in the field of ms1054 , or of a subgroup falling into the cluster .",
    "the small bright disks of all clusters were visually examined .",
    "they all appear to form one population of compact and regular disks .",
    "the fact that these galaxies are observed in all clusters , even though there are many more in ms1054 , is another argument to assume that they are not observed in ms1054 because of a field - of - view contamination .",
    "a catalog of @xmath124 galaxies from the rich clusters ms0016 , ms1054 , ms1358 , and ms1621 is presented .",
    "it shows positions , photometry , and quantitative morphology obtained through modeling of the galaxies .",
    "each galaxy was fitted with three different models ( bulge , disk , bulge and disk ) , and assigned a type based on the comparison of the best fit of each model ( as evaluated by the @xmath47 optimization ) .",
    "the galaxies were then classified by both an observer for a subset , an by a computer script for all the data set .",
    "the classification produces the morphology measurements : the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio , the scale - lengths , axial ratios , position angles and surface brightnesses of both the bulge and disk components of the galaxies .",
    "the validity of these techniques was tested by comparing the results they produce to well known properties of cluster galaxies .",
    "first of all , the color - magnitude relation made with observed values is examined .",
    "the galaxies assigned a `` bulge '' type are concentrated in the region of the red sequence , a tight distribution in the color - magnitude plane .",
    "this is in agreement with the known fact that the red sequence is formed by the ellipticals in the center of the cluster .",
    "the disk galaxies generally have bluer colors , and the scatter increases with fainter magnitudes . secondly , the morphology gradients observed in the clusters through the morphology - radius relation with the morphology classes defined in this paper are those expected : the number of disk galaxies increases with radius , while the intermediate and bulge galaxies are more numerous in the inner regions of the cluster .",
    "the catalog of measurements was applied to the study of luminosity evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "a population of small ( @xmath125kpc ) , high surface brightness disks is observed in ms1054 .",
    "some of these disks are also present in the other clusters , but in much smaller numbers .",
    "two models were tested to account for the presence of the small bright disks in ms1054 : the first model considers a size evolution with redshift , and the second a luminosity evolution .",
    "the size evolution model is not successful at describing the data .",
    "the luminosity evolution model does a good job , albeit not perfect , at explaining the differences in population with redshift . as a result , a luminosity enhancement of @xmath6 magnitude from @xmath7 to @xmath8 was observed .",

    "<S> examination of the relations between disk scale - length and central surface brightness suggests , under the assumption that these clusters represent a family who share a common evolutionary history and are simply observed at different ages , that there is a dramatic change in the properties of the small disks ( @xmath5 kpc ) . </S>",
