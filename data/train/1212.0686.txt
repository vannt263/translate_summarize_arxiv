    "@xcite discovered the first planet orbiting a normal star outside our own solar system , 51peg , from radial velocity ( rv ) measurements .",
    "the first transiting planet was found using photometric observations of a system , hd209458 , already known from rv measurements to host a planet @xcite .",
    "ogle - tr-56 was the first planet discovered from its transits @xcite .",
    "the transit detection method uses photometry to measure the change in received flux from a star when a planet crosses the stellar disc .",
    "since then , ground - based transit detection surveys such as wasp @xcite and hat @xcite have been set up around the world .",
    "once a survey has discovered a transiting extrasolar planet ( tep ) , follow - up spectroscopic and photometric observations are required to properly characterise the system .    to achieve high - precision photometry",
    "requires not only a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) but also nullification of many systematic effects inherent in ground - based photometry .",
    "@xcite investigated the use of defocussed telescopes to obtain high - precision photometry .",
    "telescope defocussing causes the light from point sources to be distributed over thousands of ccd pixels .",
    "this allows the use of longer exposure times , which means that the ccd is read out less often .",
    "this reduced dead time means that more photons can be collected over a given time interval , leading to lower poisson and scintillation noise .",
    "flat - fielding noise also averages down by an order of magnitude due to the large number of pixels in the software aperture , and changes in seeing become inconsequential .",
    "many researchers have used the technique of defocussed photometry to obtain precise measurements of the parameters of tep systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the defocussing technique is only suitable for bright isolated stars .",
    "if a star is too faint then the increased background and read - out noise can be detrimental .",
    "if the target and comparison stars are in a crowded field then defocussing will cause their point spread functions ( psf ) to become blended with those of nearby stars .    the discovery of the tep system wasp-50 was presented by @xcite , who found it to comprise a tep with a mass of @xmath6@xmath7  and radius of @xmath8@xmath9 , orbiting a cool star with mass and radius @xmath10@xmath11  and @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "we observed wasp-50 with the aim of improving its measured physical properties , using the telescope - defocussing approach .",
    "we used the new technology telescope ( ntt ) operated by eso at la silla , chile .",
    "this telescope is alt - az mounted and has a thin primary mirror whose shape is maintained using active optics . whilst these qualities are not outwardly well - suited to the telescope - defocussing approach , we have previously found the ntt to work well for this type of observations @xcite .",
    "we observed two complete transits of wasp-50 using the ntt , achieving extremely low photometric scatters of 258 and 211 parts per million ( ppm ) , respectively , versus a fitted model . to our knowledge",
    "the latter is the lowest scatter ever achieved in ground - based photometry per point for a point source .",
    "some of the highest photometric precisions previously accomplished for a tep system are 479ppm for corot-1 using the 8.2 m vlt @xcite , 478ppm for wasp-4 using the 6.5 m magellan baade telescope @xcite , 470ppm for wasp-10 using the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope @xcite , 387ppm for wasp-2 using a 1.5 m telescope @xcite , and 316ppm for tres-2 using the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias @xcite .",
    "the highest photometric precision we are aware of from a ground - based telescope was previously 258ppm in time - series observations of stars in the open cluster m67 @xcite .",
    "an alternative metric which is well - suited to direct comparison is signal to noise per unit time .",
    "we have calculated the scatter in ppm per minute of observing time for the datasets listed above . by this metric",
    "the better of our two datasets is almost exactly equal to the best one presented by @xcite , and both of our light curves are better than any previously published ground - based photometric observations of a tep system .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     once the photometric parameters of wasp-50 had been measured , we moved to the determination of its physical characteristics .",
    "we adopted the approach of @xcite , which uses the parameters measured from the light curves and spectra , plus tabulated predictions of several theoretical models .",
    "we adopted the values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 from table[tab : results ] , and the stellar properties of effective temperature @xmath17k , metal abundance @xmath18}}= -0.12 \\pm 0.08 $ ] and velocity amplitude @xmath19ms@xmath20  @xcite .",
    "an initial value of the velocity amplitude of the planet , @xmath21 , was used to calculate the physical properties of the system using standard formulae and the physical constants listed by @xcite .",
    "the mass and @xmath22 $ ]  of the star were then used as interpolates within tabulated predictions from stellar theoretical models , in order to find the expected @xmath23  and radius .",
    "@xmath21 was then iteratively refined to find the best agreement between the observed and predicted @xmath23 , and the light - curve - derived @xmath24 and predicted @xmath25 .",
    "this was performed for ages ranging from zero age to the terminal - age main sequence , in steps of 0.01gyr .",
    "the overall best fit was identified , yielding estimates of the physical properties of the system and the evolutionary age of the star .",
    "this procedure was performed separately using five different sets of stellar theoretical models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the spread of values for each output parameter was used to determine a systematic error .",
    "statistical errors were propagated by perturbing each input parameter in turn to quantify the effect on each output parameter .",
    "the final results of this process have good internal agreement ( between the five sets of theoretical models ) and are also consistent with those found by @xcite .",
    "the final physical properties are given in table[tab : model ] and include separate statistical and systematic errorbars for those parameters with a dependence on the theoretical models .",
    "the final statistical errorbar for each parameter is the largest of the individual ones from the solutions using each of the five different stellar models .",
    "the systematic errorbar is the largest difference between the mean and the individual values of the parameter from the five solutions .",
    "in the pursuit of obtaining accurate properties for transiting extrasolar planetary systems we have achieved photometric precisions of 258 and 211ppm in observations of wasp-50 , which to our knowledge is a record for ground - based photometry of a point source . our approach was to heavily defocus the 3.6 m ntt and to use exposure times of 120150s .",
    "we also benefitted from the presence of a good comparison star , at a distance of 2.25arcmin from wasp-50 and with similar colours and @xmath26-band apparent magnitude .",
    "the sky brightness was also low , as the moon was below the horizon for most of our observations .",
    "we reduced our data using two independent pipelines , finding agreement between them .",
    "we modelled the light curves using the prism and jktebop codes , again finding good agreement . from these results and",
    "published spectroscopic measurements we have deduced the physical properties of the wasp-50 system to high precision .",
    "the properties of the planet wasp-50b are now known to within 5% ( mass ) , 2% ( radius ) , 4% ( density ) and 2% ( surface gravity ) .",
    "this compares to 6% , 4% , 9% and 6% , respectively , in the discovery paper @xcite .",
    "we also obtained a refined orbital ephemeris .",
    "further improvements in precision could be made in the shorter term by obtaining additional radial velocity measurements , and in the longer term by using sets of stellar models which show a better interagreement on properties of the host star wasp-50a .    in our study of wasp-19",
    "@xcite we found a modest discrepancy between limb darkening coefficients measured from three datasets taken with the same telescope .",
    "this was attributed to the fact that wasp-19a is an active star with significant starspot activity , which alters the limb - darkening behaviour of the star @xcite . whilst wasp-50 does show modest chromospheric activity , as judged from emission in the caii h and k lines @xcite ,",
    "starspot anomalies have not been observed in any of the five transit light curves of this system .",
    "the limb darkening coefficents found from our two datasets are in excellent agreement ( 0.02-@xmath27 ) , supporting the suggestion that starspots affect stellar limb darkening .",
    "finally , we have checked if observations of this high precision could be used to characterise transiting super - earths .",
    "we injected a synthetic transit of a 2r@xmath28 planet in front of wasp-50a into the residuals of our best fits from both nights , and binned the data together .",
    "this simulated light curve ( fig.[fig : sim ] ) shows a clear transit signature , suggesting that ground - based defocussed photometry of transiting super - earths is a viable possibility .",
