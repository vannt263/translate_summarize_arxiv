    "the role of pdz domains in the organization of protein complexes at the plasma membrane has been increasingly recognized in the last decade  @xcite",
    ". proteins containing several pdz domains ( up to 13 in the mupp1 protein  @xcite ) act as scaffolds that cluster together different transmembrane , membrane associated and periplasmic proteins involved , among other functions , in signaling pathways  @xcite and ion permeability  @xcite .",
    "the participation of pdz domains in the organization of supramolecular complexes in skeletal muscle cells has also been documented  @xcite .",
    "pdz domains associate with other proteins by binding their carboxyl - terminal aminoacids  @xcite , as highlighted by the structure of several pdz domains , such as the third pdz domain of psd95 ( postsynaptic density-95/disks large / zonula occludens-1 )  @xcite and the pdz domain of zasp ( z - band alternatively spliced pdz - motif )  @xcite , although internal structures , such as @xmath0-hairpins that mimic c - terminal geometries can also be recognized , as in the complex between nnos ( neuronal nitric oxide synthase ) and syntrophin  @xcite .",
    "recently , due to their central role as key mediators of protein  protein interactions in mammalian cells , pdz domains have been the object of intense study , with the aim of designing small molecules capable of acting as modulators or inhibitors of the pdz binding activity in a controlled fashion .",
    "efforts have focused in the design of both non  peptide  @xcite and peptide  @xcite ligands , with the ambition to develop molecular probes to study the biophysical and biochemical properties of pdz domains and to devise new small molecule  based therapeutic strategies .",
    "hence , the great importance of understanding the principles of peptide  pdz interactions .",
    "the geometry and chemistry of binding to pdz domains involve the fit of the last 4 to 5 carboxyl - terminal aminoacids into a groove between a @xmath1-helix and a @xmath0-strand on the pdz surface ( fig.[fig : struct ] ) , with the last c - terminal residue almost invariably hydrophobic .",
    "the specificity of each domain is conferred by a few ( 2 to 3 ) pdz surface aminoacids that make contacts with the residues in positions -1 to -4 relative to the c - terminal in the target protein  @xcite .",
    "the surprising simplicity of this binding scheme possibly explains why pdz domains are one of the most widespread binding modules yet identified , since just a few incremental , concerted mutations involving surface aminoacids ( hence unlikely to change the overall protein stability ) can tune the affinity of pdz domains for different targets . on the other hand ,",
    "a binding architecture that relies on just a few optimized contacts comes at the price of losing strict specificity .",
    "indeed , recent experiments on 26 mouse pdz domains and domain clusters have confirmed that each pdz domain can bind to several peptides  @xcite , and that each peptide , in turn , can bind to several pdz domains .    in a recent work @xcite , we have explored via normal mode analysis  ( nma ) the mechanical aspects of binding of a peptide to a pdz domain . in line with the results of nma analysis of several proteins  @xcite ,",
    "the picture that emerged was that a limited number of low - frequency modes suffice to reconstruct the observed conformational change from the apo to the complexed structure of the pdz .",
    "the long - range spatial correlations that characterize these modes correspond to a concerted _ breathing _",
    "motion of the binding cleft , thus suggesting that functional dynamics is deeply rooted in the native architecture itself .",
    "however , despite their success in providing a qualitative picture of the coupling between thermal fluctuations of the structure and the binding deformation , the predictive power of normal modes is still limited by the harmonic approximation .",
    "hence , in order to investigate the progressive detachment of the peptide from the pdz structure , one must resort to more general computational studies .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have played a crucial role in understanding the basis of the concomitant selectivity and promiscuity of the pdz binding dynamics  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in particular , have used all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) with a realistic force - field to correctly reproduce the experimental ranking , but not the precise values , of binding free - energies .",
    "the chemical details of the target peptide and of the binding groove have been taken into account , and hydrophobic effects have been shown to be key determinants of the promiscuity , with other interactions conferring stronger or weaker selectivity .",
    "the free energy difference @xmath2 between the unbound and bound states is customarily related to the dissociation constant @xmath3 by @xmath4 where t is the absolute temperature and @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "however , the constant @xmath3 is also related to the dynamics of the system by the equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the unbinding and binding rates respectively . at a first approximation , @xmath7 and @xmath9",
    "depend on the free energy difference between the bound and unbound states and the barrier between them .",
    "the dissociation constant @xmath3 , therefore , conceals the kinetics of the system , the same value being compatible with both very fast and very slow rates , as long as their ratio does not change . in the case of pdz domains ,",
    "dissociation rates range experimentally  @xcite from a few s@xmath10 to 10@xmath11 s@xmath10 , thus implying that a correct description of the unbinding process would need to capture the pdz dynamics over comparable timescales .",
    "unfortunately , detailed all - atom md simulations can at present cover a few tens  @xcite and at most reach a hundred nanoseconds .",
    "therefore , in order to observe a typical unbinding event , md simulations should be from 6 to 10 orders of magnitude longer than currently possible .",
    "hence , one must resort to simpler , coarse - grained models in order to study the kinetics of interaction between a pdz domain and its target peptide .    neglecting",
    "the atomic detail clearly has both advantages and drawbacks .",
    "on the one hand , the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom and the simplified force - field of interaction allow to explore longer times scales , thus making a complete equilibrium description of the binding kinetics possible .",
    "on the other hand , the chemical specificities can be reincorporated in the model only at a qualitative level .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the g@xmath12 strategy  @xcite , a native - centric scheme , coarse - grained at the residue level to simulate the unbinding dynamics of a peptide from the third pdz domain of psd-95 ( henceforth referred to as pdz3 ) .",
    "such simplified description has already proved successful in the characterization of the role of the native state topology and of its dynamics in protein recognition and binding mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "our simplified simulation scheme allows us to draw a clear , though approximated , picture of the dissociation kinetics .",
    "the escape of the peptide from the binding groove on the pdz surface takes place over a free - energy landscape that strongly depends on the temperature . at physiologically relevant temperatures , less than 10% lower than the unfolding temperature ( measured to be about 320k for the second pdz domain of ptp - bl  @xcite )",
    ", the free energy difference between the bound state and the barrier turns out to be rather small ( @xmath13 kcal / mol ) because of the nearly complete compensation of the enthalpic and entropic components . as a consequence , unbinding at physiological temperatures is eminently a diffusive , rather than thermally activated , process and",
    "the unbinding rate is orders of magnitude smaller than an arrhenius - like extrapolation from low temperatures would suggest .",
    "the pdz3 domain ( pdb codes 1bfe and 1be9 without and with bound peptide respectively ) as resolved by x - ray crystallography  @xcite is 110 residue long but we truncated the chain from arg309 to ser393 because the final loop does not participate to the binding mechanism and its large flexibility may hinder some signals specifically involved in the binding .",

    "we have performed fixed - temperature molecular dynamics simulations within the isokinetic scheme  @xcite , which provides a correct sampling of the configuration space .",
    "we have then applied the multiple histogram technique  @xcite to estimate thermodynamic observables such as the internal energy , the specific heat @xmath39 and the structural similarity @xmath40 of a given conformation with the native structure .",

    "the multiple histogram technique allows to construct the free energy profiles @xmath43 as functions of @xmath40 , which plays the role of a reaction coordinate .    in order to obtain the free energy profiles of unbinding , we employed the umbrella sampling technique  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we restrained the distance between the peptide and the pdz3 centers of mass @xmath44 to a given range of values @xmath45 @xmath46 via the harmonic umbrella potential @xmath47 with @xmath48 kcal / mol / @xmath49 .",
    "the multiple histogram technique allows then a de - biasing at a given temperature by matching all the histograms for the center - mass distance collected around the different sampling values . by varying the reference temperature",
    "we can obtain different free energy curves .",
    "the statistics of the unbinding times have been collected through langevin dynamics .",
    "the unbinding time is defined here as the time at which the bond distances of all the 13 contacts linking the peptide to the pdz3 exceed a given threshold for the first time .",
    "we fixed such thresholds at 1.5 times the corresponding values in the native conformation .",
    "however , small variations of this threshold did not result in major changes of the exit times statistics .",
    "the energy scale @xmath34 can be fixed by comparing the folding temperature @xmath50 of the model , in units of @xmath51 , with experiments . for this purpose",
    "we studied the pdz - domain specific heat @xmath52 as a function of temperature .",
    "the thermogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] allows to identify the unfolding transition at @xmath53 . from available data  @xcite , the folding temperature of pdz3 is close to 323 k ( 50@xmath54 c ) , which allows to set the model energy scale to the value @xmath55 kcal / mol . the free energy profile as a function of the fraction of native contacts @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] , inset ) is typical of clean two - state transitions , in agreement with experiments  @xcite , where folding was found to be affected at most by a high energy poorly populated intermediate .",
    "a further check of the chosen energy scale may be obtained from a comparison with the experimental stability @xmath56 kcal / mol of pdz3 at 298 k @xcite . from our simulations",
    "we can estimate @xmath57 as the energy difference between the minima in the native and denaturated basins . at @xmath58 k",
    "we find @xmath59 kcal / mol , in good agreement with experiments .",
    "it is our aim to investigate the unbinding dynamics of a small peptide from the pdz3 domain .",
    "hence , both the unbinding and unfolding transitions have to be carefully located in temperature .",
    "the free - energy profiles as a function of the distance between the centers of mass of the protein and of the peptide , chosen as reaction coordinate for the unbinding , are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_en ] for several temperatures lower than that of unbinding . at low temperatures ,",
    "the curves are characterized by a well defined minimum corresponding to the bound state and by a steep free energy barrier that has to be overcome in order for the complex to thermally dissociate .",
    "remarkably , the barrier turns out to decrease rapidly at increasing temperatures , marking an almost complete compensation of the enthalpic barrier by the increase of conformational entropy .",
    "the behaviour of the dissociation free energy @xmath60 with the temperature is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : free_en ] . as expected , @xmath61 is a decreasing function of @xmath62 , vanishing at @xmath63 k , which locates the spontaneous unbinding 17@xmath54 c below the unfolding temperature .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : free_en ] contain the relevant information on the unbinding dynamics .",
    "in fact , it is possible to compute the dissociation rates by straight integration of the numerical free energy profiles according to kramers theory @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the abscissas of the minimum and of the barrier maximum , respectively .",
    "the temperature curve of the dissociation rates as calculated from formula   is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrhenius ] .",
    "our results clearly show that the simple arrhenius description @xmath69 only holds in the low temperature region , where the free energy barrier is high enough to justify the familiar treatment of a thermally activated unbinding . at higher temperatures the dissociation process slows down considerably with respect to the extrapolated low - temperature prediction .",
    "this effect is due to the gradual switch from a barrier - limited , thermally activated process at low temperatures to a diffusion - limited process as the unbinding temperature is approached . indeed , using ( [ eq : kramers ] ) in the limit case where there is a perfectly flat free - energy landscape between @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( and a reflecting wall in @xmath67 ) , hence no barrier , @xmath70 , which is the typical rate for particles diffusing from @xmath67 , with diffusion constant @xmath71 , and absorbed at @xmath68 .",
    "the diffusion - limited @xmath7 depends only slightly on temperature when represented on an arrhenius plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : arrhenius ] ) .    however , the straightforward application of kramers theory at high temperatures may not be legitimate due to the strong reduction of the free energy barriers , that makes the hypotheses of local equilibrium in the free energy minimum and high barrier questionable .     through eq .   and",
    "the rates computed as inverse average times from direct unbinding simulations",
    ". since pre - factors are unknown by construction , the latter have been rescaled by an appropriate temperature - independent factor to match the values obtained from kramers theory .",
    "all rates are normalized by the kinetic rate at room temperature @xmath72 k. the thick dashed line is the result of an arrhenius fit with the expression @xmath73 , which gives a free energy barrier height of @xmath74 kcal / mol .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks the room temperature . ]      in order to check the validity of the kramers prediction at high temperatures , we carried out kinetics simulations of unbinding to directly estimate the dissociation rate at a temperature @xmath62 .",
    "we observed the time evolution of the pdz3/peptide complex until a spontaneous unbinding event was recorded . by doing so",
    ", we were able to measure very accurately the lifetimes @xmath76 of the molecular complex , the temperature - dependent average @xmath77 and distributions @xmath78 .",
    "the inverse of @xmath77 provides a measure of the kinetic dissociation rate : @xmath79 .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in figure  [ fig : arrhenius ] together with the rates estimated from kramers formula ( [ eq : kramers ] ) .",
    "the agreement between unbinding simulations and the analytical estimates is remarkable at all temperatures where we were able to collect enough statistics for the computation of the average inverse lifetime of the complex .",
    "in fact , dissociation events become exponentially rarer at low temperatures , thus requiring unrealistic simulation times in order to collect satisfactory statistics .",
    "these results provide a direct confirmation of the validity of eq .   in the high temperature region .    that the unbinding process is diffusion - limited at high temperatures is nicely confirmed by the analysis of the the histogram of dissociation times . in fig",
    "[ fig : ptau300k ] we show one of such distributions computed at @xmath80 k. at long times @xmath78 decreases exponentially , implying that the slow unbinding events obey the statistics of the waiting times of a poisson - like process , as should be expected for a simple arrhenius picture of thermal activation over a barrier .",

    "it is known that the kinetics simulated with langevin md is strongly dependent on the friction coefficient @xmath82 .",

[ fig : arrhenius ] still hold for other values of the damping parameter when using frequencies and free energy barriers computed numerically .",

    "[ fig : arrhenius_gamma ] that the essential features of the arrhenius plot are preserved .",

    "each of them will be characterized by a different breaking time @xmath95 , that can be estimated as the average over many dissociation events in a typical unbinding simulation .",
    "the ranking between such times provides an average picture of the order at which contacts break down during the gradual detachment of the peptide from the pdz domain .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate whether there exists a correlation between the unbinding event of each pdz / peptide bond and the dynamics of the residues from the pdz domain involved in the same link .",
    "a relation between the binding dynamics and a specific spatial pattern characterizing a reduced subset of low - frequency normal modes has been recently suggested by de los rios _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in the present case",
    ", we find four modes among the eigenstates of the hessian of our force field that match the pattern identified in ref .  , namely the set @xmath96 .",
    "we thus introduce an indicator measuring the spectral weight corresponding to that set of modes at each site @xmath97 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the @xmath1 ( @xmath99 ) component of the @xmath100-th normal mode at site @xmath20 . in figure",
    "[ fig : contact ] we plot @xmath95 vs. @xmath101 for the 13 binding contacts , where @xmath20 indicates the residue of the pdz domain participating to the contact @xmath102 with the peptide .",
    "the data show to be clustered into three sets .",
    "the right outermost cluster contains the two contacts that have both a short lifetime and the larger spectral weight . in terms of the latter indicator ,",
    "these contacts are characterized by the fourth and fifth largest values among all residues .",
    "this strongly suggests that functional normal modes are likely to contribute substantially to the loosening of the pdz / peptide bond and its eventual rupture .",
    "the left bottom cluster involves the contacts with small @xmath95 but whose local fluctuations are poorly captured by the functional modes . taken together , these first two clusters include the residues forming the hydrophobic pocket : the second group comprises the residues at the bottom of the pocket whereas the first one includes two residues flanking the entry of the binding pocket . finally , the last contacts to break up involve the less conserved residues that confer specificity to the different pdz domains .",
    "overall , these results outline the following picture of a typical unbinding event . the first contacts to loosen up are",
    "those involving residues from the hydrophobic binding pocket , part of which are involved in the _ breathing _ pattern of the cleft as highlighted from normal mode analysis .",
    "this observation provides a nice example of the interpretation of a specific normal mode pattern as _ precursory _ feature of a much larger amplitude motion .",
    "the contacts that break up the last are those from the surface region of the binding pocket , the ones associated with binding specificity and thus the less conserved ones . since these residues are obviously more important as their chemical details are concerned , it is not surprising that a dynamical investigation based on a purely topological model does not assign them a key role in the unbinding kinetics .",
    "counterintuitively , this happens as a direct consequence of the strong temperature  dependent quenching of the free energy barrier in the proximity of the functional region of temperatures . as a matter of fact ,",
    "such slow down of the dissociation reflects the gradual change in nature of the fastest events from thermally activated to diffusive .",
    "indeed , as the free energy barrier gets substantially reduced at increasing temperatures due to the entropy - enthalpy compensation typical in the proximity of the unfolding transition , kramers formula   predicts a diffusion dominated unbinding process , and kinetic simulations confirm such picture .",
    "overall , diffusion slows down the process of two orders of magnitude with respect to the prediction of the arrhenius formula extrapolated from the low - temperature region .",
    "the spectral analysis of the breaking time of the contacts involved in the binding helps shedding further light on the unbinding process , that on average first involves the escape from the hydrophobic binding pocket and subsequently from the surface region where residues conferring specificity are usually located . from the time history of all the contacts that keep the peptide bound to the domain until they rupture we obtained their average lifetimes , that correlate with a picture emerged form nma analysis .",
    "this suggests a non trivial coupling between collective dynamics of the molecule and binding mechanism even at physiological temperatures .",
    "this confirms that normal mode analysis may provide a valuable method for detecting the protein chain fluctuations that represent the precursory events to unbinding .",
    "our results rest on the reliable calculation of the free - energy profile of unbinding , which is a quantity defined at ( quasi-)equilibrium , and on the precise determination of the escape - time histograms , which implies a complete description of the metastable state of the process , again a ( quasi-)equilibrium quantity .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that experimental unbinding rates range from @xmath103 to @xmath104 s@xmath10 , time - scales long enough for nanometric dynamical molecules such as pdz domains to fully explore their phase - space and consequently to be amenable to a ( quasi-)equilibrium description .",
    "unfortunately , present all - atom md with realistic force - fields can access at most few hundreds nanoseconds of the dynamics , and are thus likely to miss events relevant on the second or longer time - scales .",
    "employing a native centric backbone representation of the protein with simplified force field ( g - like model ) on the one hand allowed us a thorough investigation of the equilibrium and stationary properties of the system , and on the other hand emphasized the role of the native state geometry in the binding mechanism of the pdz3 domain .",
    "given the overall high structural similarity of the pdz family , our evidence for a diffusion - limited unbinding process likely applies to most if not all of them .",
    "although necessary to access the relevant time - scales , neglecting the chemical details of the binding cleft and of the peptide comes at a price : it is impossible to precisely rank the affinities of different peptides for the same domain and of different domains for the same peptide . at the same time",
    ", the promiscuity of pdz binding implies that some degree of generalized stickiness , captured by the simplified force - field used here , is present .",
    "moreover , we believe that our results represent a reading frame for future unbinding simulations that will become possible when algorithms and computational resources will be powerful enough to access the experimental time - scales of the process while taking into account the full chemical detail .",
