    "patterns formed by toppling dominoes are not only a spectacular view , but their dynamics is also a nice illustration of the mechanics of solid bodies . one can study the problem on different levels .",
    "walker @xcite gives a qualitative discussion .",
    "banks @xcite considers the row of toppling dominoes as a sequence of independent events : one domino undergoes a free fall , till it hits the next one , which then falls independently of the others , and so on .",
    "he assumes that in the collision the linear momentum along the supporting table is transmitted .",
    "this is a naive viewpoint , but it has the advantage that the calculation can be carried out analytically . a much more thorough treatment has been given by d. e. shaw @xcite .",
    "his aim is to show that the problem is a nice illustration of computer aided instruction in mechanics .",
    "he introduces the basic feature that the domino , after having struck the next one , keeps pushing on it .",
    "so the collision is completely _",
    "inelastic_. in this way a train develops of dominoes leaning on each other and pushing the head of the train .",
    "one may see this as an elementary demonstration of a propagating soliton , separating the fallen dominoes from the still upright ones .",
    "indeed shaw s treatment is a simple example how to handle holonomous constraints in a computer program describing the soliton . as collision law he takes conservation of angular momentum .",
    "we will demonstrate , by analyzing the forces between the dominoes , that this is not accurate .",
    "the correction has a substantial influence on the solition speed , even more important than the inclusion of friction , which becomes possible when the forces between the dominoes are known .",
    "the setting is a long row of identical and perfect dominoes of height @xmath0 , thickness @xmath1 and interspacing @xmath2 . in order to make the problem tractable",
    "we assume that the dominoes only rotate ( and e.g.  do not slip on the supporting table ) .",
    "their fall is due to the gravitational force , with acceleration @xmath3 .",
    "the combination @xmath4 provides a velocity scale and it comes as a multiplicative factor in the soliton speed .",
    "typical parameters of the problem are the aspect ratio @xmath5 , which is determined by the type of dominoes used , and the ratio @xmath6 , which can be easily varied in an experiment .",
    "another characteristic of the dominoes is their mutual friction coefficient @xmath7 which is a small number ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the first domino gets a gentle push , such that it topples and makes a `` free rotation '' till it strikes the second . after the collision",
    "the two fall together till they struck the third and so forth .",
    "so we get a succession of rotations and collisions , the two processes being governed by different dynamical laws . without friction the rotation conserves energy , while the constraints exclude the energy to be conserved in the collision .",
    "in fact this is the main dissipative element , more than the inclusion of friction .",
    "the goal is to find the dependence of the soliton speed on the interdistance @xmath6 . in the beginning",
    "this speed depends on the initial push , but after a while a stationary pattern develops : a propagating soliton with upright dominoes in front and toppled dominoes behind .",
    "the determination of the forces between the dominoes requires that we first briefly outline the analysis of shaw .",
    "then we analyze the forces between the dominoes . knowing these we make the collision law more precise . with the proper rotation and collision laws",
    "we give the equations for the fully developed solitons .",
    "the next point is the introduction of friction and the calculation of its effect on the soliton speed .",
    "as illustration we discuss the limit of thin dominoes @xmath9 , with permits for small interseparations a complete analytical solution .",
    "finally we present our results for the asymptotic soliton speed for various values of the friction and compare them with some experiments .",
    "we also give an explicit formula , which displays the main dependence of the soliton speed on the parameters of the problem .",
    "the paper closes with a discussion of the results and the assumptions that we have made .",
    "the basic observation is that domino @xmath10 pushes over domino @xmath11 and _ remains in contact afterwards_. so after the contact of @xmath10 with @xmath11 the motion of @xmath10 is constrained by the motion of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore we can take the tilt angle @xmath12 of the foremost falling domino , as the only independent mechanical variable ( see fig . [ dominoes ] ) .",
    "simple goniometry tells that @xmath13 to see this relation it helps to displace domino @xmath11 parallel to itself , till its bottom line points at the rotation axis of domino @xmath10 ( see fig . [ dominoes ] ) . by this relation",
    "one can express the tilt angle @xmath14 in terms of the next @xmath15 and so on , such that all preceding tilt angles are expressed in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "the recursion defines @xmath14 as a function of @xmath12 of the form @xmath16 i.e. the functional dependence on the angle of the head of the train depends only on the distance @xmath17 .",
    "the functions @xmath18 satisfy @xmath19 with the starting function @xmath20 .",
    "they are defined on the interval @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angle of rotation at which the head of the train hits the next domino @xmath23 we will call @xmath22 the angular distance . from the picture it is clear that the functions are bounded by the value @xmath24 , which is the angle for which the right hand side of ( [ a1 ] ) vanishes @xmath25 @xmath24 is the angle at which the dominoes are stacked against each other at the end of the train .",
    "we call @xmath24 the stacking angle .",
    "the picture shows that the functions @xmath18 are monotonically increasing functions .",
    "they become flatter and flatter with the index @xmath26 and converge to the value @xmath24 ( at least not too close to the maximum separation @xmath27 , see section [ calc ] ) .",
    "the functions are strongly interrelated , not only by the defining recursion ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "the angle @xmath14 can be calculated from the head of the train @xmath12 by @xmath28 but also from an arbitrary intermediate @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "this implies @xmath31 one easily sees that @xmath32 .",
    "therefore one has @xmath33 a property that will be used later on several times .",
    "an inmediate consequence of ( [ a1 ] ) is the expression for the angular velocities @xmath34 in terms of @xmath35 . from the chain rule of differentiation we find @xmath36 with @xmath37 computationally",
    "it is easier to calculate the @xmath38 recursively",
    ". differentiation of ( [ a3 ] ) with respect to @xmath12 yields @xmath39 } \\right).\\ ] ] another useful relation follows from differentiation of the second relation ( [ a6 ] ) @xmath40 since @xmath32 and @xmath41 .",
    "without friction , the motion between two collisions is governed by conservation of energy , which consists out of a potential and a kinetic part .",
    "the potential part derives from the combined height of the center of mass of the falling dominoes , for which we take the dimensionless quantity @xmath42.\\ ] ] the kinetic part is given by the rotational energy , for which holds @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the angular moment of inertia with respect to the rotation axis and @xmath45 is the mass of the dominoes .",
    "we write the total energy as @xmath46 where the dimensionless effective moment of inertia @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 we have factored out @xmath49 in ( [ b3 ] ) as it is an irrelevant energy scale .",
    "this has the advantage that the expression between brackets is dimensionless .",
    "the factor @xmath50 @xmath51 provides a time scale that can be incorporated in @xmath35 . from now on we put this factor equal to unity in the formulae and remember its value when we convert dimensionless velocities to real velocities .",
    "we see ( [ b3 ] ) as the defining expression for @xmath35 as function of @xmath12 @xmath52 as mentioned @xmath53 is a constant during interval @xmath54 .",
    "so we can solve the temporal behavior of @xmath12 from the equation @xmath55 the initial value for @xmath12 is 0 and the final value equals the rotational distance @xmath56 .",
    "the duration of the time interval where @xmath54 is the head of the chain , follows by integration @xmath57 in this time interval the soliton has advanced a distance @xmath58 .",
    "the ratio @xmath59 gives the soliton speed , when the head of the train is at @xmath54 . in order to integrate the equations of motion ( [ b6 ] )",
    "we must have a value for @xmath53 which basically amounts to finding an initial value @xmath60 as one sees from ( [ b3 ] ) . in the next section",
    "we outline how to calculate successively the @xmath61 .    putting all ingredients together",
    "we obtain the asymptotic soliton speed @xmath62 as @xmath63 in this formula the time @xmath64 is computed from the dimensionless equations ( setting @xmath50 equal to 1 ) .",
    "we now investigate what happens when domino @xmath54 hits @xmath65 . in a very short time",
    "domino @xmath65 accumulates an angular velocity @xmath66 .",
    "the change in @xmath67 takes place while the tilt angles of the falling dominoes hardly change .",
    "shaw @xcite postulates that the total angular momentum of the system is unchanged during the collision .",
    "this is not self - evident and we comment on it in section [ coltrain ] . before the collision we have the angular momentum @xmath68 after the collision we have @xmath69 equating these two expressions yields the relation @xmath70 with the aid of this value we compute the total energy @xmath71 and the next integration",
    "can be started .",
    "for the first time interval holds @xmath72 since only the zeroth domino is involved and it starts in upright position with angular velocity @xmath73 .",
    "the value of @xmath73 has no influence on the asymptotic behavior .",
    "after a sufficient number of time intervals , a stationary soliton develops .",
    "conservation of energy requires the dominoes to slide frictionless over each other . before we can introduce friction we have to take a closer look at the forces between the falling dominoes . without friction the force which @xmath10 exerts on @xmath11 is perpendicular to the surface of @xmath11 with a magnitude @xmath74",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ dominoes ] ) . consider to begin with the head of the train @xmath54 .",
    "domino @xmath54 feels the gravitational pull with a torque @xmath75 @xmath76 and a torque from domino @xmath77 equal to the force @xmath78 times the moment arm with respect to the rotation point of @xmath54 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath54 becomes @xmath79.\\ ] ] domino @xmath77 feels , beside the gravitational pull @xmath80 , a torque from @xmath54 which slows it down and a torque from @xmath81 which speeds it up .",
    "generally the equation for domino @xmath10 has the form @xmath82 the coefficients of the torques follow from the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ dominoes ] .",
    "@xmath83 note that the first equation ( [ d2 ] ) is just a special case with @xmath84 .",
    "another interesting features is that @xmath85 .",
    "so @xmath10 gains less from @xmath86 than @xmath86 looses to @xmath10 . therefore dominoes , falling concertedly , gain less angular momentum than if they would fall independently .",
    "this will have a consequence on the application of conservation of angular momentum in the collision process .",
    "we come back on this issue in the next section .",
    "we can eliminate the forces from the equation by multiplying ( [ d2 ] ) with @xmath87 and the general equation with @xmath88 and chosing the values of @xmath89 such that @xmath90 then adding all the equations gives @xmath91 =    \\sum_i [ \\,f_{i-1 } \\,r_{n - i } \\",
    ", a_{i-1 } - f_i \\ , r_{n - i-1 } \\ , a_i\\ , ] = 0.\\",
    "] ] now observe that the recursion for the @xmath89 is identical to that of the @xmath38 as given in ( [ a10 ] ) .",
    "with @xmath92 we may identify @xmath93 .",
    "it means that if we multiply ( [ d6 ] ) with @xmath35 and replace @xmath94 by @xmath95 , we recover the conservation of energy in the form @xmath96 it is not difficult to write the sum of the torques as the derivative with respect to time of the potential energy , thereby casting the conservation of energy in the standard form .",
    "so if conservation of energy holds , the elimination of the forces is superfluous . however , equation ( [ d6 ] ) is more general and we use it in the treatment of friction .",
    "we have assumed that in the collision of the head of chain @xmath54 with the next domino @xmath65 conserves angular momentum . having a more detailed picture of forces between the sliding dominoes we reconsider this assumption . in this section without friction and in section [ friction ] with friction .",
    "the idea is that in the collision domino @xmath54 , exerts a impulse on @xmath65 and vice versa with opposite sign . in other words : one has to integrate the equations of motion of the previous section over such a short time that the positions do not change , but that the velocities accumulate a finite difference . however , not only the jump in velocity propagates downwards , also the impulses have to propagate downwards in order to realize these jumps . denoting the impulses by capital @xmath97 s , domino @xmath10 receives @xmath98 from @xmath11 and @xmath99 from @xmath86 .",
    "so we get for the jumps in the rotational velocity @xmath100 w_1 ( 0)\\ , \\omega_{n+1}(0 ) - w_0 ( \\theta_c)\\,\\omega_n ( \\theta_c ) & =   & f_{n-1 } \\ , a_{n-1 } - f_n \\ , b_n,\\\\*[2 mm ] \\cdots & =   & \\cdots \\\\*[2 mm ] w_{n+1-i } ( 0)\\ , \\omega_{n+1 } ( 0 ) - w_{n - i } ( \\theta_c)\\,\\omega_n ( \\theta_c )   & = & f_{i-1 } \\ , a_{i-1 } - f_i \\ , \\,b_i .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the same as those defined in ( [ d4 ] ) .",
    "if we would have @xmath103 we could add all equations and indeed find that the angular total angular momentum is conserved in the collision .",
    "but only @xmath104 since @xmath105 . the impulse @xmath98 can be eliminated in the same way as before by multiplying the @xmath10th equation with @xmath106 and adding them up . for the coefficient of @xmath66",
    "we get @xmath107 and for the coefficient of @xmath108 one finds with ( [ a10 ] ) @xmath109 as general relation we get @xmath110 in our frictionless case @xmath93 and therefore @xmath111 .",
    "so the desired relation reads @xmath112 we have added the last equality since it smells as a conservation of angular momentum using the effective angular moment of inertia @xmath113 .",
    "this inertia moment is however linked to the energy and not to the angular momentum .",
    "the true angular momentum conservation is given in section [ collision ] .",
    "it is also not conservation of kinetic energy .",
    "then the squares of the angular velocities would have to enter .",
    "the difference with the earlier relation ( [ c3 ] ) is that the sum involves the squares of the @xmath114 s .",
    "this has a notable influence on the asymptotic velocity .",

    "it is the difference between an upright domino and a stacked domino at angle @xmath24 .",
    "the functional form reads explicitly @xmath126 it is clear that the domino effect does not exist if @xmath125 is negative , because a domino tilted at the stacking angle has a higher potential energy than an upright domino .",
    "we use ( [ z7 ] ) in the conservation law for the energy , taken at @xmath127 @xmath128 solving @xmath61 and @xmath108 from ( [ z3 ] ) and ( [ z11 ] ) yields @xmath129 by and large @xmath130 sets the scale for the rotation velocity .",
    "the dependence on @xmath131 is rather weak . for large",
    "@xmath131 it drops out .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath131 is 2 which is reached for large separations .",
    "after all this groundwork it is relatively simple to introduce friction . let us start with the equation of motion ( [ d3 ] ) .",

    "but we can not identify any longer @xmath135 with @xmath136 . in order to use ( [ d6 ] )",
    "we must express the accelerations @xmath137 in the head of chain @xmath138 .",

    "next we insert ( [ f5 ] ) into ( [ d3 ] ) and obtain @xmath144 the equation can be transformed into a differential equation for @xmath145 by dividing ( [ f8 ] ) by @xmath146 @xmath147 we use this equation to find @xmath35 as function of @xmath12 and then ( [ b6 ] ) again to calculate the duration of the time between two collisions .    the inclusion of friction in the collision law is even simpler , since relation ( [ e4 ] ) remains valid , but now with the definitions ( [ f3 ] ) for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "sometimes limits help to understand the general behaviour .",
    "one of the parameters , which has played sofar a modest role , is the aspect ratio @xmath5 . in our formulae",
    "it is perfectly possible to take this ratio 0 . in practice",
    "infinitely thin dominoes are a bit weird , because with paperthin dominoes one has e.g. to worry about friction with the air . in this limit",
    "we can vary @xmath6 over the full range from 0 to 1 . in fig .",
    "[ cthans ] we have plotted the asymptotic velocity as function of the separation @xmath6 . the curve is rather flat with a gradual drop  off towards the large separtions .",
    "we discuss here the two limits where the separation goes to 0 and where it approaches its maximum @xmath27 . both offer some insight in the overall behavior .",
    "if the dominoes are narrowly separated , the head of chain rotates only over a small angle @xmath148 and the collisions will rapidly succeed each other .",
    "the number of dominoes with a tilt angle @xmath14 between 0 and @xmath149 becomes very large and slowly varying with the index @xmath10 .",
    "so a continuum description is appropriate .",
    "we first focus on the dependence of @xmath150 on the index @xmath10 and later comment on the dependence on the weak variation with @xmath12 ( which is confined to the small interval @xmath151 ) .",
    "we take as coordinate @xmath152 the distance of domino @xmath10 .",

    "not surprisingly we find that the shape of the tilt angles is a function of the difference with respect to the head of the train .",
    "the above expression gives the shape of the soliton .",
    "next we comment on the dependence of this profile on the angle @xmath12 .",
    "as mentioned it can be only weak as the interval for @xmath12 is narrow .",
    "thus it suffices to know a few derivatives and for that , the interpretation ( [ a10 ] ) is useful .",
    "the behavior of @xmath38 in the continuum limit , follows from the differential form of the recursion relation @xmath163 with the solution @xmath164 note that , not unexpectedly , the form of @xmath165 follows also from that of @xmath166 by differentiation with respect to @xmath167 .",
    "similarly the expression for @xmath142 , as given by ( [ f6 ] ) , can be obtained from differentiation of ( [ h7 ] ) with respect to @xmath167 @xmath168    what still is needed is the propagation velocity of the soliton , or in the present language : how fast @xmath54 or @xmath167 moves with time . as the foremost domino rotates over a small angle @xmath169 ,",
    "the head of train covers the distance @xmath6 with the rotation velocity @xmath35 .",
    "so the propagation speed equals @xmath35 . as before",

    "it starts as @xmath182 and it saturates exponentially fast to the value @xmath183 ( leading to @xmath184 ) .",
    "thus we have obtained in the continuum limit a full and explicit solution .",
    "it may serve as an illustration for the general discrete case .      on the other side , near maximal separation @xmath185 , also a simplification occurs . here",
    "the number of dominoes involved in the train is restricted to a few .",
    "the head of the train rotates over almost @xmath149 before it strikes the next domino .",
    "so one comes close to the picture of banks @xcite in which the toppling of the dominoes is a succession of independent events .",

    "a small angle further it has dropped to 1 , since @xmath197 drops to 0 . as the energy is conserved the kinetic energy of domino @xmath54 is transferred to domino @xmath65 .",
    "so @xmath67 rises by a factor @xmath198 in a short interval .",
    "therefore we start the integration of the time after this sudden increase , using the conservation law for the energy @xmath199 in particular we have the relation for @xmath200 @xmath201 the collision law for this degenerate case becomes @xmath202 note that since the @xmath38 are either 1 or 0 , there is no difference between the proposal by shaw ( see ( [ c3 ] ) ) and ours ( see ( [ e5 ] ) ) .",
    "the stationary state is obtained by the identification @xmath203 . combining ( [ h21 ] ) and ( [ h22 ] ) then yields @xmath204 .",
    "thus the time integral for the interval becomes in the stationary state @xmath205 the reciprocal yields the asymptotic soliton speed @xmath206 .",
    "the story of thin dominoes gives a warning on the numerical integration scheme .",
    "for small separations we need many intervals before the asymptotic behaviour has set in .",
    "on the other hand we do not need many points in the integration for the time of a rotation . for wide separations",
    "it is the opposite : only a few intervals are needed for the asymptotic behavior , but we have to perform the time integration with care .",
    "the factor @xmath113 in the energy law is rapidly varying for small @xmath207 .",

    "this gives quite a different value , since the transmission of linear momentum becomes inefficient . for small separations",
    "the transmission is nearly perfect ( as becomes our collision law ) .",
    "the conservation of energy of a single rotating domino reads @xmath210 for the stationary state we insert ( [ h24 ] ) into ( [ h25 ] ) and get @xmath211 for small @xmath22 , the value @xmath212 approaches @xmath213 , which is again substantially smaller than our limiting value 1 .",
    "the reason is that the dominoes , which keep leaning onto each other and onto the head of the train , speed up the soliton .",

    "the frictionless case we can use the formulae of section [ solitons ] , i.e. first calculate the asymptotic value of @xmath215 and then integrate the rotation equation to find the time between two collisions and thus the asymptotic soliton speed . with friction we must iteratively find @xmath215 , by trying a value of @xmath215 , then solve equation ( [ f8 ] ) for @xmath216 and finally apply the collision law in order to see whether we come back to our trial @xmath215 .",
    "a form of iteration is to start the train with one domino and an arbitrary initial @xmath73 and let the train grow longer such that an asymptotic pattern develops .    in table",
    "[ tab ] we have summarized the results . the thickness to height ratio is set at @xmath214 since this is the only value on which experiments @xcite are reported .",
    "the first column gives the separation @xmath6 , the second the soliton speed using shaw s collision law and the third gives the results for ours ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "in the subsequent columns the influence of the friction is indicated .",
    "note that the reduction of the speed due to the change of the collision law is larger than that of modest friction .",
    "the curves corresponding to these values are shown in fig .",
    "[ survey ] , which also contains the experiments of maclachlan et al .",
    "they suggest that the soliton speed diverges for short distances , while we find a maximum .",
    "their values seem to correspond best with the friction coefficient @xmath217 .",
    "we found empirically the value @xmath218 , by estimating the angle of the supporting table at which dominoes start to slide over each other .    in order to make the behavior of fully developed solitons more transparant",
    ", we may introduce , for frictionless dominoes , the average @xmath219 with @xmath220 the solution of ( [ z4 ] ) .",
    "this average is a number close to @xmath221 ( with @xmath125 defined in ( [ z8 ] ) ) , since the integrand varies from a value slightly larger than @xmath221 to a value slightly less than @xmath221 .",
    "then we get for the asymptotic soliton speed the formula @xmath222 where the factor @xmath223 is given by @xmath224 here we have reinstalled the factor @xmath50 in order to include in this formula , all the factors that contribute to the velocity . the factor @xmath223 is shown as function of @xmath6 for various @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ shape ] .",
    "one may consider @xmath223 as the main factor determining the dependence of the soliton speed on the parameters of the problem .",
    "the fraction in ( [ z14 ] ) is a refinement which requires a detailed calculation .",
    "we found that this fraction is virtually independent of the aspect ratio @xmath5 .",
    "it stays close to 1 for the the major part of the range of practical separations . only around the already `` unworkable '' separation @xmath225",
    "the value has increased some 10% .",
    "a good indicator for the behavior is the curve for the frictionless thin dominoes which is the product of the fraction and @xmath226 .",
    "we mentioned in section [ solitons ] that the function @xmath125 as given by ( [ z8 ] ) has to be positive for the existence of the domino effect .",
    "this gives a bound on the minimal distance @xmath6 , which can be cast in the form @xmath227 separations smaller than the value of ( [ z9 ] ) do not show the domino effect and slightly above that limit the train has difficulty to develop .",
    "the reason is that after a while , too many dominoes of the train get tilt angles , which have a higher potential energy than an upright domino .",
    "ultimately the fraction of these dominoes in the train looses out against the dominoes at the end of the train , which are tilted at the stacking angle ( with a potential energy _",
    "lower _ than an upright domino ) .",
    "one can overcome this barrier by starting with an unreasonble high initial @xmath73 .",
    "so ( [ z9 ] ) is the true theoretical limit , but in practice the domino effect will not start for slightly larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "another limitation of the _ theory _ is at the other side .",
    "the dominoes at the end of the train are tilted at the stacking angle @xmath24 _ provided _ the height @xmath0 is sufficiently large .",
    "the condition is @xmath228 for smaller @xmath0 the dominoes fall flat on the supporting table .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath229 beyond this value the train is actually shorter than blind application of the formulae would suggest .",
    "it is not so interesting to sort out what precisely happens if ( [ i2 ] ) is violated , since then the no - slip condition for the dominoes is highly questionable .",
    "for such wide separations the force on the struck domino has hardly a torque to rotate it .",
    "it rather induces the rotation axis to slide along the table .",
    "in fact , as a practical limitation , we look to the height of impact . if it is above the center of mass of the struck domino , it will start to rotate and below that value , it may slip if the friction with the supporting table is not large enough .",
    "this criterion yields the limit to the distance @xmath230 which is already a large separation , not far from the limit set by ( [ i2 ] ) for @xmath231 .    for very thin",
    "dominoes ( [ z9 ] ) is hardly a limitation .",
    "however , ( [ z9 ] ) and ( [ i3 ] ) form a window of separations for the existence of the domino effect , which depends on the thickness @xmath5 .",
    "this window narrows down to zero and the domino effect disappears for @xmath232 this estimate comes close to the one given by freericks @xcite .",
    "friction also makes the excluded interval larger .",
    "for @xmath233 we have not found a domino effect for @xmath234 , which is , for @xmath214 , about 7 times the theoretical limit .",
    "so our estimate ( [ i4 ] ) for the upper thickness is still too optimistic .",
    "we have studied the toppling of a row of equally spaced dominoes under the assumptions that the dominoes only rotate and that they keep leaning onto each other after a collision with the next one . by and large",
    "we follow the treatment of shaw @xcite , who introduced the constraint ( [ a1 ] ) , which synchronizes the motion of train of toppling dominoes . by analyzing the mutual forces between the dominoes ,",
    "we have corrected his collision law and we could also account for the effect of friction between the dominoes .",
    "the correction of the collision law is more important than the influence of friction , given the small friction coefficient between dominoes .",
    "the limit of thin dominoes @xmath235 leads to a completely tractable model . for large separations",
    "we encounter a situation which resembles the viewpoint of banks @xcite , seeing the toppling as a succession of independent events .",
    "however his collision law differs substantially from ours and can not be reconciled with the force picture that we develop .",
    "we give a formula ( [ z14 ] ) , which displays explicitly the main dependence of the soliton speed on the parameters of the problem .",
    "the maximum speed which can be reached , appears close to the closest separation for which the domino effect exists .",
    "the assumptions , on which our calculation are based , are the no - slip condition and the constraint ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "one can help the no - slip condition by increasing the friction with the supporting table ( putting them on sandpaper as walker @xcite does ) .",
    "if the no - slip condition is violated , it is the end of the domino effect as the dominoes are kicked over with the wrong rotation .",
    "we argue that this will happen when the falling domino hits the next one below its center of mass .",
    "the constraint ( [ a1 ] ) is implied by the assumption that the collision is fully inelastic .",
    "this assumption is supported by slow motion pictures of the effect , which show that the dominoes indeed lean onto each other while falling .",
    "it is an interesting question what happens , if the collision would be less inelastic .",
    "the extreme opposite , fully elastic collisions , yields an ever increasing soliton speed .",
    "a falling domino increases its rotation velocity as soon as its center of mass goes down .",
    "if this is fully transmitted to the next domino , the rotation velocity keeps increasing . in that case friction",
    "can not play a role since the dominoes do not touch each other . in the less extreme case of partially inelastic collisions ,",
    "the dominoes also rotate without contact , but friction can play a role during the collision . as fig .",
    "[ dominoes ] indicates , friction always rotates the mutual impulse such , that the torque on the next one decreases and that the reaction torque increases .",
    "this will slow down the train and a stationary state can develop .",
    "therefore it would be interesting to experiment with dominoes of different making ( e.g. steel ) to see the increase in the soliton speed .",
