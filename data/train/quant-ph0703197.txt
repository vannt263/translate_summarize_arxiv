    "since the appearance of the quantum teleportation protocol @xcite and its experimental demonstration @xcite , whereby an arbitrary state describing a quantum system can be transferred from one recipient ( alice ) to another ( bob ) , several new quantum communication protocols have appeared .",

    "these nodes are connected by multipartite entangled quantum channels and by properly using one or several of the aforementioned protocols one could avoid errors and eavesdropping during the transmission of a state between nodes @xcite .    however , most treatments of these protocols assume bipartite or multipartite maximally entangled channels , whereas in realistic scenarios decoherence and noise ensure that that is not the case .",
    "one suggested solution is quantum distillation protocols @xcite , which allow us to obtain a maximally entangled state from a large ensemble of partially entangled states , although only asymptotically .",

    "moreover , alice can change the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the transferred state at will for each run of the protocol .",

    "one obtains the well - known result of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , which is the optimal average fidelity @xcite .",
    "we now begin to study each qubit s disentanglement effect on the channel efficiency @xmath63 .",
    "we investigate how the port , ancillary and copies disentanglement influence the overall channel efficiency and how we can remedy the disentanglement effect as modelled by eq .",

    "the first qubit we treat is the port . applying the map giving in eq .",
    "( [ disentanglement - def ] ) only to the port qubit ( i.e. @xmath71 ) we get : [ c - pro - port ] c^pro_1(2)=_j= ( 1 + ) .",
    "note that for @xmath72 we obtain @xmath70 , the original telecloning efficiency @xcite .",
    "moreover , noting that for this case the channel can be written as @xmath73 it is evident to see that the same treatment as in the generalized teleportation protocol ( gtp ) @xcite and the generalized quantum state sharing ( gqsts ) @xcite applies here . by simply changing the measurement basis ( adjusting a proper @xmath45 ) and choosing the proper acceptable measurements one can either retain unit probability of success with low fidelity ( @xmath74 , accepting all results ) , or",
    "transform the protocol to a probabilistic one with optimal fidelity ( @xmath75 ) .",

    "finally , we can see that the greater the channel efficiency ( eq .",
    "( [ c - pro - port ] ) ) the greater the channel global entanglement .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ cproeg1 ] .     global entanglement ( black - solid ) , as given by eq .",

    "it is interesting to note that the ancillary disentanglement ( @xmath82 ) has no effect on the overall channel efficiency . in other words ,",
    "eq .  ( [ c - pro - ancilla ] ) does not depend on @xmath83 .",
    "it is worth noting that eq .",
    "( [ c - pro - ancilla ] ) is equal to eq .",
    "( [ c - pro - port ] ) when @xmath84 , i.e. , when one still has a maximally entangled channel ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "again we find that the overall channel efficiency is optimal for @xmath74 , namely @xmath70 .      the last case to consider is the one in which we apply the map to the copies . in this case , we assume that the port and the ancillary qubits are not affected ( i.e. @xmath86 ) . the channel efficiency can be rewritten as [ c - pro - copy ] & c^pro_1= ( 1 + ( ^(1)+^(2)c(n_c_1)c(m ) ) ) , + [ symmetric - mutual - concurrence ] & ^(1)= , ^(2)= , + & = .[lambda ] for the second copy , @xmath87 is given by changing @xmath67 . as we discuss below , eq .",

    "firstly , let us analyze some trivial limiting cases . for @xmath74",
    ", note that when @xmath88 we obtain , as it should be , @xmath70 , the noiseless optimal limit .",
    "moreover , when @xmath89 we get @xmath90 .",
    "this value can be understood noting that for this case the channel is @xmath91 , i.e. we have no entanglement whatsoever .",
    "thus the telecloning protocol can be seen as the usual teleportation protocol whose efficiency is at most @xmath92 when we have pure but not entangled channels @xcite .",
    "furthermore , only for the case when @xmath93 , we see that the channel efficiency of the first copy does not depend on @xmath94 , as can be seen looking at eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "a similar argument applies for the second copy channel efficiency .",
    "this is remarkable and it means that the application of the map on the second ( first ) copy changes the protocol efficiency of the first ( second ) copy in a way that depends on the application of the map on the first ( second ) copy . finally , when @xmath95 one recovers @xmath96 , similar to eq .  , with @xmath97",
    "this shows that the action of the map on the port qubit ( @xmath98 ) changes @xmath99 in exactly the same way as when the map acts on just the first copy ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the case where the map acts only on the port qubit , we were not able to devise a procedure by which we can increase the fidelity of the copies , even in a probabilistic protocol .",
    "in other words , equating @xmath101 does not improve the fidelity of the copies , contrary to a similar successful strategy ( @xmath76 ) employed for the port qubit case .",
    "we end this section showing that the channel efficiency is a monotonic increasing function of the global entanglement , as depicted in fig .",

    "we want , therefore , to create a gtp channel between alice and copy 1 ( bob ) in detriment of copy 2 ( charlie ) , who will have a considerable decrease of his channel efficiency .",
    "this can be achieved by ` disentangling ' copy 2 from alice s qubit and copy 1 .",
    "the final goal is to concentrate all the entanglement of the channel between alice and bob .",
    "firstly , let us restrict ourselves to local unitary operations ( alice s site ) .",

    "this is a gtp - like channel between @xmath3 and @xmath1 but with @xmath119 instead of @xmath109 , which is the cost one pays for the inaccessibility to the copy qubits .",
    "however , the channel efficiency is still large since for @xmath93 we have @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , we can also implement with the above channel a probabilistic teleportation protocol .",
    "this means we can have , sometimes , a unity fidelity teleported state , i.e. a successful run of the protocol @xcite .",

    "we have analyzed all the three possible ` disentanglement ' scenarios .",
    "firstly , acting locally on the port qubit , the reduction of the channel s entanglement can be dealt with in a probabilistic manner , similar to the approach employed for the generalized teleportation and quantum state sharing protocols . here",
    "we can achieve the optimal fidelity for the telecloned qubits by properly rotating alice s measurement basis .",
    "secondly , the ancillary s disentanglement has no effect on the overall average efficiency , as expected from an ancillary .",

    "all these results highlight that non - maximally pure entangled channels can also be employed to the direct implementation of quantum telecloning , although only probabilistically . and",
