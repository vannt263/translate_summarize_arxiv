    "<S> in this review we discuss the multifaceted problem of spin transport in hydrogenated graphene from a theoretical perspective . </S>",
    "<S> the current experimental findings suggest that hydrogenation can either increase or decrease spin lifetimes , which calls for clarification . </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss the spin - orbit coupling induced by local @xmath0 re - hybridization and @xmath1 c - h defect formation together with the formation of a local magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> first - principles calculations of hydrogenated graphene unravel the strong interplay of spin - orbit and exchange couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of magnetic scattering resonances , recently introduced @xcite is revisited by describing the local magnetism through the self - consistent hubbard model in the mean field approximation in the dilute limit , while spin relaxation lengths and transport times are computed using an efficient real space order n wavepacket propagation method . </S>",
    "<S> typical spin lifetimes on the order of 1 nanosecond are obtained for 1 ppm of hydrogen impurities ( corresponding to transport time about 50 ps ) , and the scaling of spin lifetimes with impurity density is described by the elliott - yafet mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this reinforces the statement that magnetism is the origin of the substantial spin polarization loss in the ultraclean graphene limit .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction_.-remarkable electronic and transport properties of graphene ( see for instance @xcite ) can be further tailored towards higher functionality through the use of chemical functionalization @xcite , irradiation ( defect formation ) @xcite or structural patterning ( such as creating a nanomesh superlattice ) @xcite . among the wealth of possible modifications , hydrogenation , ozonization or fluorination </S>",
    "<S> have demonstrated the tunability of graphene from a weakly disordered semimetal to a wide band - gap or anderson insulator depending on the nature and density of impurity atoms , varying typically from @xmath2 to few percent @xcite . together with raman spectroscopy which provides an estimate of defect density , analysis of the low - temperature conductance behaviour and weak localization regime enable evaluation of the main transport length scales ( such as the mean free path and localization length ) @xcite . surprisingly , strongly hydrogenated graphene , with anomalously large ioffe - regel ratio of @xmath3 still exhibits quantum hall effect features in the high magnetic field regime @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> hydrogen defects are particularly interesting since , together with a resonant scattering state created locally in space , the breaking of the sublattice symmetry entails the formation of a zero - energy mode and a local magnetic moment on the order of 1 bohr magneton for an isolated hydrogen adatom @xcite . meanwhile , the coupling between different induced magnetic moments is either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , depending on whether the h - adatoms correspond to the same or to different sublattices of the graphene lattice , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical calculations have reported specific magnetoresistance signals for specific long range magnetic ordering situations @xcite , which could be realized by substrate - induced chemical reactivity as proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene spintronics has attracted a lot of attention since the pioneering demonstration that spin could be efficiently injected and propagated over long distances at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has opened an opportunity for the development of lateral spintronics @xcite , that would benefit from the unique features of graphene , such as a high mobility and remarkable electronic and transport features like relativistic energy dispersion , klein tunneling phenomenon , ... @xcite . in table 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we compile the typical values obtained for charge and spin transport in a variety of graphene devices , from graphene supported on silicon oxide or boron nitride to suspended graphene . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that the variation of mobility varies by up to two orders of magnitude , whereas spin lifetime seems difficult to relate to the quality of the material .    </S>",

    "<S> the underlying goal is to use a low enough level of hydrogenation to preserve a sizable transport signal while also inducing local or long range magnetic ordering ( ideally a ferromagnetic ground state ) , and evaluate how spin diffusion is affected by interaction between itinerant spins and local magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , one could envision spin devices such as spin valves that do not use ferromagnetic materials to inject and detect spins , but rather utilize the varying signal response of `` magnetized graphene '' to manipulate the spin degree of freedom and engineer logic functions , a long - standing quest of spintronics @xcite .    from that perspective , the first experimental result showing some interaction between spin diffusion and magnetic moments produced by h adatoms was reported in 2012 by mccreary and coworkers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> low - temperature spin transport measurements on graphene spin valves ( t=15k ) were shown to exhibit a dip in the non - local spin signal as a function of the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was tunable with hydrogen density , and was related to spin relaxation spin relaxation by exchange coupling with paramagnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> spin lifetimes were estimated to be @xmath42ps in absence of hydrogen , and were slightly enhanced upon increasing the h - adatom density up to @xmath43 ) , and accompanied by a reduction of charge mobility by one order of magnitude to @xmath44 .    a subsequent experiment also reported a surprising increase of spin lifetime with hydrogen density , with values enhanced by a factor of two after hydrogenation of the samples for @xmath45 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the upscaling of @xmath46 with hydrogen density suggests a dyakonov - perel relaxation mechanism @xcite . in these experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of magnetic moments is proposed to be strong enough to counteract the expected increase of spin - orbit coupling , which would be expected to produce shorter spin lifetimes with increasing h - adatom density .    in 2013 , j. balakrishnan and coworkers @xcite reported experimental evidence for a room temperature spin hall effect ( she ) in weakly hydrogenated graphene , with non - local spin signals up to @xmath47 ( orders of magnitude larger than in metals ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non - local she revealed by larmor spin - precession measurements was assigned to a `` colossal enhancement '' of the spin - orbit interaction induced by h - adatoms for density in the range @xmath48 , mobilities @xmath49 ) and spin lifetime on the order of @xmath50ps . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit interaction was estimated to be about 2.5 mev , one order of magnitude higher than _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the large she - signal was exclusively assigned to an enhancement of spin - orbit coupling by h - adatoms , which limits spin lifetimes . </S>",
    "<S> it is however not clear whether the previously observed contribution of magnetic moments in spin transport @xcite remains marginal or not for the formation and strength of the she signal , and which mechanism ( dyakonov - perel @xcite or elliott - yafet @xcite ) can explain the variety of conflicting experimental data .    in this context , it is of prime importance to clarify the specific impact of h - adatoms on spin relaxation in graphene , and to quantify the relative contribution of spin - orbit coupling and magnetic effects . </S>",
    "<S> a first fundamental advance in this direction has been made by kochan , gmitra and fabian @xcite who introduced a new relaxation mechanism in hydrogenated graphene driven by resonant scattering by magnetic impurities . by neglecting the spin - orbit coupling effect , </S>",
    "<S> spin lifetimes of @xmath51ps were estimated for 1 ppm hydrogen at room temperature and for large contribution of electron - hole puddles . </S>"
