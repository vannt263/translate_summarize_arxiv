    "relativistic brownian motion is an interesting and active area of research nowadays@xcite .",
    "the dynamical behavior of any relativistic process is , of course , strongly constrained by the main properties of the relativistic kinematics , namely the speed of light @xmath3 as the maximum possible physical velocity , the invariance under lorentz transformations , and the causal structure associate with the light - cone .",
    "some well established non - relativistic dynamical behaviors are simply incompatible with the principle of special relativity .",
    "this is specifically the case of the so - called lvy flights @xcite , where very rare events with arbitrarily high velocities give rise to a superdiffusive regime characterized by a power law [ sqr ] x^2(t)t^ , where @xmath4 is the corresponding anomalous diffusion exponent .",
    "however , special relativity does not allow such arbitrarily high velocities , preventing the appearance of such superdiffusive regime in markov chains involving spacetime events .",
    "these points are studied , for instance , in @xcite by using relativistic versions of the fokker - planck equation and of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , leading to a fractional - derivative extension of the diffusion equation .",
    "an earlier analysis of relativistic random walks can be found in @xcite . in @xcite , a generalized wiener process avoiding superluminal propagation",
    "is introduced , giving rise to a non - markovian relativistic diffusion process .",
    "the influence of the spacetime causal structure on dynamical processes , namely the implication of the presence of an event horizon , was investigated recently in @xcite .",
    "we consider here a simple relativistic extension of the weierstrass random walk in order to shed some light on several relativistic aspects of lvy flights .",
    "we remind that the usual one - dimensional weierstrass random walk@xcite corresponds to a markov chain governed by the following probability density function [ pdf ] ( x ) = _ n=0^a^-n ( ( x+vj_n ) + ( x - vj_n ) ) , with the `` jump '' function [ weier ] j_n = j_n^(nr ) = b^n , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are dimensionless constants and @xmath7 gives the scale of the jumps .",
    "a particle moving according to ( [ pdf ] ) and ( [ weier ] ) can perform jumps , in both directions , with magnitude @xmath8 , and with probability , respectively , given by @xmath9 .",
    "we consider here that each step @xmath10 lasts for a given and fixed time interval and , hence , the asymptotic dynamics for large times and for large number of steps are identical .",
    "one can think the constant @xmath11 as the velocity acquired by the particle , just prior to the jump , by some unspecific microscopic mechanism .",
    "notice that one can indeed define a continuous - time version of the weierstrass random walk@xcite , but for our purposes here , the simple markov chain governed ( [ pdf ] ) is enough .",
    "we are mainly interested in the anomalous diffusion process associated to the weierstrass random walk .",
    "a brief review of the main results concerning this topic is necessary here .",
    "we wish to characterize the large @xmath12 behavior of @xmath13 , where x(l ) = x_1+x_2+x_3++x_l , with @xmath14 being the size of the @xmath15 jump , with probability density function given by ( [ pdf ] ) and ( [ weier ] ) .",
    "since @xmath14 are independent random variables for different @xmath10 , we will have x^2(l ) = l x^2 .",
    "[ diff ] notice that [ quadr ] x^2= _ -^x^2(x ) dx = v^2 _ n=0^()^n , from where we have that , for @xmath16 , @xmath17 is finite , equation ( [ diff ] ) reduces to the usual diffusion process with @xmath18 , and , thanks to the central limit theorem , the total probability density function describing the passage from @xmath19 to @xmath20 will be very close to a gaussian . for @xmath21 , on the other hand , @xmath17 diverges , the central limit theorem can not by applied anymore and the associated distributions will not be gaussian , leading to an anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath22 .",
    "we can use the heuristic approach of @xcite in order to evaluate @xmath23 for this case as well , which correspond to @xmath24 , where = .",
    "the key idea is that , according to ( [ pdf ] ) and ( [ weier ] ) , if one considers a large number @xmath12 of steps , the most frequent steps will have magnitude @xmath11 .",
    "steps with magnitude @xmath25 will be @xmath26 less frequent than the previous one . in general , steps with magnitude @xmath27 will be @xmath26 less frequent than those ones with magnitude @xmath28 .",
    "also , if we consider large , but finite , number of steps , the summation ( [ pdf ] ) will be effectively truncated at a given value @xmath29 .",
    "let us consider the following succession of steps , which exhibits the required hierarchy of jumps , l = a^n_max + a^n_max-1 + a^n_max-2 + + 1 , corresponding to @xmath30 steps with magnitude @xmath11 , @xmath31 with with magnitude @xmath25 , and so on . for large @xmath32 ,",
    "we have [ l ] l = _ j=0^n_max a^n_max - j a^n_max .",
    "yet for large but finite @xmath32 , we can estimate @xmath17 as [ est ] _ j=0^n_max ( ) ^j . for @xmath33 , as we already know , we have the gaussian result since < , which coincides with the exacted result evaluated from ( [ quadr ] ) . for @xmath34 , on the other hand , equation ( [ est ] ) implies that [ quad1 ] ( ) ^ l^-1 , where ( [ l ] ) was used , leading to a superdiffusive @xmath35 behavior characterized by [ quad11 ] ( ) ^ l^. the relativistic kinematics , however , will change dramatically this scenario .",
    "the microscopical origin of the jumps in a non - relativistic random walk is not relevant from the dynamical point of view .",
    "provided that the markov property holds , _",
    "i.e. _ , the position @xmath36 of the system at a given step @xmath10 depends only on the position at the previous step @xmath37 , and that successive jumps are independent random variables , the standard approach to lead with random walks @xcite can be applied .",
    "let us , nevertheless , suppose that the jumps are due to microscopical collisions as in the historical example of brownian motion .",
    "the hierarchy of jumps @xmath8 is , in the nonrelativistic case , associated with a similar hierarchy of momentum transfers in the collisions @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the particle rest mass .",
    "however , according to special relativity , the velocity and the momentum of a particle should obey p= , where @xmath41 , with profound implications for the jump hierarchy . assuming that the same hierarchy of momentum transfers is present in the relativistic case , we will have the following jump function [ relatweier ] j_n = j_n^(r ) = , instead of ( [ weier ] ) .",
    "the hierarchy of relativistic jumps will be @xmath42 , occurring in the dynamics , respectively , with probability @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "notice that , in frank contrast with the nonrelativistic case , for large @xmath45 , one has @xmath46 , meaning that there will be no arbitrarily large jumps in the relativistic case , in agreement with the fact that no acquired velocity by any microscopical mechanism can exceed @xmath3 .",
    "the first conclusion we can draw from this relativistic extension of the weierstrass random walk is that the whole process must be gaussian , since , in this case , we have [ quadrel ] = _ n=0^ < , for any @xmath47 , implying the usual diffusion with @xmath18 , irrespective of the value of @xmath48 .",
    "typical non - relativistic situations are characterized by a small @xmath49 . for such cases , from ( [ quadrel ] )",
    ", one realizes that there should exist a critical value @xmath50 such that , for @xmath51 , the summand of ( [ quadrel ] ) is essentially the same one of the nonrelativistic case .",
    "if it is possible to choose a large @xmath52 , one could apply the same heuristic approach of last section , implying in a superdiffusive behavior with @xmath53 .",
    "( we assume hereafter that @xmath54 . )",
    "this occurs because @xmath12 is large enough to justify the averages of last section , but it is still small enough to guarantee that the large @xmath45 events that would imply the relativistic regime are extremely rare and will not contribute effectively to the averages . in other words ,",
    "the system needs some time to realize that it is indeed relativistic !",
    "if we allow for @xmath55 , we will have in ( [ quadrel ] ) the convergent relativistic summation , implying the usual diffusion with exponent @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear that n_c = - = , leading to [ lc ] l_c = , where ( [ l ] ) was used .",
    "if @xmath49 is small , as one expects in the typical nonrelativistic problems , @xmath56 will be large . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the system behaves as in the nonrelativistic regime and exhibits the properties of a lvy flight with @xmath58 . on the other hand , for @xmath59 , the system change its behavior to the relativistic regime , characterized by ordinary diffusion with @xmath18 .",
    "such crossover between different diffusion regimes , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is compatible    with the results of @xcite .",
    "in fact , our model can be viewed as a simple microscopical realization for the generalized fokker - planck equation considered there .",
    "we can apply the same heuristic approach of last section to the relativistic case .",
    "in particular , we have for a finite and large @xmath32 [ quadrel2 ] l _ n=0^n_max , leading to the following generalization of ( [ quad11 ] ) for @xmath60 ( see the appendix for details )    [ eqtot ] ,    where @xmath61 stands for the standard hypergeometric function@xcite . using that @xmath62",
    ", we have from ( [ eqtot ] ) an anomalous diffusion process with @xmath58 . for large @xmath12 obeying @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath59 , we have ( see the appendix for details ) [ asym ] f(1,1- ; 2- ; - ( ) ^ ) ( ) ^1- , leading to the usual gaussian diffusion l , for @xmath59 .",
    "the results of the preceding sections can be summarized as follows .",
    "suppose we have a weierstrass random walk model with typical velocity @xmath11 , implying in lvy flights characterized by an anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath63 .",
    "then , relativistic effects imply that , after a certain critical number of steps @xmath64 , the system loses it anomalous diffusion properties and the dynamics necessarily settle into a gaussian diffusion . in order to estimate the order of magnitude of these relativistic effects ,",
    "let us associate the kinetic energy of the walking particle , and thus @xmath11 , with the typical thermal energy @xmath65 . for non relativistic situations , where @xmath65 is small if compared with @xmath66 , we will have @xmath67 , leading to l_c ( ) ^.    as our first explicit example , let us consider a system composed by helium atoms , for which @xmath68k .",
    "for such a system at room temperature ( @xmath69k ) , a ballistic @xmath70 lvy flight originated in a weierstrass random walk , will become gaussian due to relativistic effects after @xmath71 steps .",
    "helium atoms at the surface of the sun ( @xmath72k ) can experiment ballistic lvy flights in a weierstrass random walk for no more than @xmath73 steps . in the interior of the sun ( @xmath74k )",
    ", only @xmath75 steps will be enough for the the dynamics settle into a essentially gaussian regime .",
    "heavier particles or bodies will , naturally , lead to larger values for @xmath56 .",
    "let us take , for instance , the case of an _ escherichia coli _ bacterium , for which @xmath76 femtograms @xcite , leading to @xmath77k .",
    "at room temperature , @xmath78 for an _ escherichia coli _ undergoing a lvy flight originated in a weierstrass random walk with diffusion exponent close to those ones observed experimentally@xcite in systems of breakable micelles @xmath79 .",
    "one realizes that such microscopic bodies can indeed experience much longer anomalous diffusion process than atomic scale particles .",
    "we can approximate ( [ quadrel2 ] ) by an integral by using [ integr ] _ n=0^n_max _",
    "1^b^2n_max dw , where variable @xmath80 was introduced and @xmath48 is , in general , an irrational . for @xmath81 , we can introduce the following series expansion [ expans ] = _",
    "n=0^(-^2 w)^n , and the integral ( [ integr ] ) will be written as @xmath82 where @xmath61 is the standard hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "notice that the hypergeometric functions have a single valued analytical extension over the entire complex plane , with the only exception of the positive real axis for @xmath83 @xcite , justifying the use of ( [ hyper ] ) for the evaluation of the integral ( [ integr ] ) , which limits , in fact , do not belong to the region where the expansion ( [ expans ] ) converges .",
    "the integral ( [ integr ] ) may also be evaluated by exploring the hypergeometric function identities@xcite ( z^c-1f(1,b;c;z ) ) = ( c-1)z^c-2f(1,b;c-1;z ) , and @xmath84 , valid for any @xmath85 and @xmath3 .",
