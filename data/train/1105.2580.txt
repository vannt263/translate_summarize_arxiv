    "lenticular , or s0 galaxies , sitting on the intersection of the hubble sequence , are often thought to be the remnants of spiral galaxies after their star formation ( sf ) has ceased or slowed down substantially ( bekki et al .",
    "2002 ; van den bergh 2009a , b ) .",
    "this reduction of the sf rate ( sfr ) must be directly related to the decrease of the cold gas content and/or density in the galactic disk .",
    "the change could be caused by various internal or external mechanisms ( e.g. , martig et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) , such as ram - pressure stripping ( of cold gas ) , termination or strangulation ( removing surrounding hot gas , the cooling of which may be a source of new cold gas ) , morphological quenching ( heating of a stellar disk or even transforming to a spheroid ) , and exhaustion ( consuming gas via sf ) .",
    "the relative importance of these mechanisms can not be easily determined because large uncertainties remain in our understanding of these processes , especially in terms of their connection to the observed properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . however , if only galaxies in relative isolation are considered , where the external mechanisms are likely ineffective , the removal of the cold gas must then be dominated by the internal processes .",
    "type  ia sn feedback is one such internal process , especially in s0 galaxies with a modest mass and a low sfr .",
    "( 2009 ) ( paper i ) found extraplanar filamentary dusty features in the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc  5866 , which they suggested is cold gas blown out from the galactic disk . for individual dusty filaments ,",
    "the energy required to lift them is comparable to the energy of a single sn .",
    "the sf in this galaxy is inactive and less energetic than type  ia sne .",
    "the latter is thus likely the origin of these features and the dominant source of cold gas removal in this special case .",
    "currently there is still not much direct evidence for gas removal by type  ia sne in s0 galaxies .",
    "however , cold gas is detected in many of them , either produced by evolved star mass loss or leftover from precursor spiral galaxies ( sage & welch 2006 ) .",
    "possible interactions between the cold gas and the hot gas produced by sn heating may have various forms as : photo evaporation ( melioli et al .",
    "2005 ) , turbulent mixing due to kelvin - helmholtz instability ( cooper et al . 2009 ; pittard et al . 2010 ) , and enhanced radiative cooling ( melioli & de gouveia dal pino 2004 ; melioli et al . 2005 ; cooper et al . 2009 ) , etc .",
    "these interactions can have significant effects on the observed hot gas properties .",
    "in particular , the mass loading of cold gas into the hot phase can increase the density , while reduce the specific energy or temperature of the hot gas , so enhance the observed soft x - ray emission .",
    "in addition , the reduced specific energy makes the hot gas take more time to flow out and better mix with the interstellar medium ( ism ) , resulting in a lower sn heating efficiency , i.e. , the fraction of the sn energy used to drive the outflow ( melioli & de gouveia dal pino 2004 ; strickland & heckman 2009 ) .",
    "the dynamical state and the observed soft x - ray luminosity of the hot gas thus crucially depend on the cold gas content ; the cold - hot gas interaction behaves like a glue that helps to make the gas easier to be gravitationally bound .",
    "although indirect evidence of this cold - hot gas interaction , such as the complicated thermal structure of the hot gas , has been revealed in some late - type galaxies ( e.g. , strickland et al .",
    "2004 ; li et al . 2008 ; owen & warwick 2009 ) , it is difficult to find direct evidence for such interaction in early - type galaxies .",
    "this is because early - type galaxies often have a low cold gas content and their hot gas luminosity is usually thought to be determined by stellar mass instead of the cold gas properties .",
    "however , the relations between the hot gas luminosity ( @xmath0 ) and various stellar mass tracers , such as b - band or k - band luminosities ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) , typically show scatters in @xmath0 as large as @xmath8 orders of magnitude at a certain @xmath6 or @xmath7 value ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "many possibilities have been discussed to explain such a large scatter ( e.g. , ellis & osullivan 2006 ; for a review , refer to mathews & brighenti 2003 ) , including agn heating ( e.g. , david et al . 2006 ) , environmental effects ( e.g. , white & sarazin 1991 ; helsdon et al .",
    "2001 ; mulchaey & jeltema 2010 ) , various dynamical states of gas flows ( e.g. , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) , different stellar mass distributions ( e.g. , brighenti & mathews 1996 ; pellegrini 1999 ) , different ages of the stellar populations ( e.g. , memola et al .",
    "2009 ; boroson , kim & fabbiano 2010 ) , and various dark matter halo to stellar mass ratios ( e.g. , mathews et al .",
    "2006 ) , etc .",
    "in addition to these mechanisms , due to the cold - hot gas interaction described above , it is also possible that the various cold gas contents in early - type galaxies may make some contributions to the scatter of this stellar mass-@xmath0 relation .    in this paper , we present _ chandra _ observations of five nearby isolated s0 galaxies to study the hot gas properties of them , and explore the relations between the cold / hot gases .",

    "they are then subtracted with the local sky background and modeled with a thermal plasma ( _ mekal _ or _ vmekal _ in xspec ) plus various stellar contributions : ( 1 ) the emission from cvs and abs , ( 2 ) the emission from unresolved lmxbs below the detection threshold , as well as residual photons after the source removal .",

    "many theoretical and observational works have been presented to explain this trend .",
    "the two most important mechanisms are the partially rotation - supported gravitational potential and the flattened stellar mass distribution ( e.g. , ciotti & pellegrini 1996 ; brighenti & mathews 1996 ; dercole & ciotti 1998 ) .",
    "rotation is thought to be important in reducing the @xmath0 in two different ways , either by reducing the effective gravitational potential or by moving the gas to larger radii . in the sequential wind , outflow and inflow scenario ( ciotti et al . 1991 ) ,",
    "ciotti & pellegrini ( 1996 ) showed that rotation can not change the state of the gas flow for any fixed galaxy structure , but can only make the existing flow state more stable .",
    "for early - type galaxies in wind or outflow states , rotation could reduce @xmath0 , but as the dynamical state is not changed , it only has a minor effect . on the other hand , brighenti & mathews ( 1996 ) showed that in hydrostatic or inflow states , rotation can significantly reduce the @xmath0 in sense of flattening the x - ray isophotes . due to the increasing ordered motion introduced by the rotation , more gas",
    "is deposited in a large disk when it cools , and arrives at larger radii after long - term evolution .",
    "it can then be removed by ram - pressure stripping or sn feedback .",
    "the total effect is to flatten the central diffuse x - ray surface brightness distribution and reduce the observed @xmath0 .",
    "different optical and diffuse x - ray morphologies have been evidenced in normal elliptical galaxies , but such differences are suggested to be produced by agn feedback instead of rotation - supported gravitational potential ( diehl & statler 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "however , it is still not clear if rotation is more important in quiescent s0 galaxies , which typically have substantial rotation .",
    "ciotti & pellegrini ( 1996 ) showed that even in the presence of massive spherical dark matter halos , the flattening of stellar mass distribution ( s0 or elongated elliptical galaxies ) is sufficient to change the dynamical state of the gas flow from inflow to wind .",
    "such a flattening will greatly reduce the observed @xmath0 .",
    "dercole & ciotti ( 1998 ) further showed in their 2-d simulations that the flattening of the stellar mass distribution can cause decoupling of the gas flows , i.e. , after the initial wind phase , the flow tends to revert to an inflow in the polar region , while keep outflowing in the outer disk .",
    "this decoupled gas flow results in a lower @xmath0 of flattened galaxies than that of spherical galaxies .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lk_lx ] , high mass s0 galaxies , in particular ngc  4382 and ngc  1316 , are indeed x - ray fainter than elliptical galaxies of the same stellar masses . however , at the low mass end , e and s0 galaxies tend to be indistinguishable in @xmath0 .",
    "we combine all the s0 galaxies in the three samples ; by jointly fitting them , we obtain an @xmath66 relation as : @xmath71 in comparison , the similar fittings of the elliptical galaxies in mulchaey & jeltema ( 2010 ) ( eq .",

    "we now investigate how the cold gas content may affect the x - ray properties of early - type galaxies , and hence the scatter of the @xmath66 relation .    as the slope of the @xmath76 relation is @xmath77 ( eqs  [ equi : lklxalls0]-[equi : lklxborosone ] )",
    ", we compare the total cold gas mass @xmath4 with @xmath3 .",
    "we obtain the cold gas masses mostly from a volume limited sample , which excludes members of the virgo and fornax clusters ( welch & sage 2003 ; sage et al . 2007 ;",
    "welch et al .",
    "for ngc  2681 , we obtain the atomic and molecular gas masses from haynes et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and taniguchi et al .",

    "[ fig : coldm_lx ] may be expected .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath3 appears to correlate positively with @xmath4 for cold - gas - poor galaxies ( @xmath5 ) , whereas an anti - correlation is apparent for cold - gas - rich ones .",
    "these ( anti-)correlations with the cold gas content can significantly contribute to the large scatter in the @xmath66 relation .",
    "in early - type galaxies with a fixed gravitational potential , the observed diffuse x - ray luminosity is mainly determined by the specific energy of hot gas ( energy per particle ) ( e.g. , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; tang et al .",
    "2009a , b ) . the higher the specific energy ,",
    "the faster the gas flows out , hence the lower the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the specific energy is determined by the ratio of the energy and mass input rates ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we thus explain the observed cold - hot gas relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coldm_lx ] ) by assuming that early - type galaxies , especially s0s , are evolved from cold - gas - rich precursors after a major starburst epoch , without further replenishment of external cold gas . in this scenario ,",
    "the energy input is then mainly from sne , while the mass input is from stellar mass loss and gas leftover from star formation .",
    "initially , the energy input rate ( especially from prompt type  ia sne , after initial core - collapsed sne ) decreases fast after the cease of starburst ( e.g. , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; tang et al .",
    "2009a ) , while the mass - loading may be reasonably steady or even saturated , via the evaporation of the leftover cold gas",
    ". in comparison , the mass input from stellar mass loss may not be as important at this early stage . as a result",
    ", the specific energy of the hot gas is expected to decrease with time , hence the increase of the x - ray luminosity with time .",
    "after the prompt type  ia sn stage , the energy input rate decreases only slowly . as the bulk of the leftover gas",
    "has been evaporated ( e.g. , when @xmath79 ) and as the mass input from the stellar mass loss also decreases with time , one may expect that the specific energy of the hot gas could begin to increase with time .",
    "this specific energy increase may then explain the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath80 at the lower @xmath80 end . in this scenario , after the major starburst epoch , most of the leftover cold gas is gradually removed by the long - lasting type  ia sne feedback , which also helps to quench the sf .    the general trend of fig .",
    "[ fig : coldm_lx ] could be roughly explained with the above scenario .",
    "however , the real case may be much more complicated .",
    "for example , the spatial distribution of cold gas may affect the efficiency of cold / hot gas interaction and so the observed hot gas luminosity .",
    "as the distribution of hot gas concentrates toward the inner bulge in most cases , the galaxies with a more centrally concentrated distribution of cold gas are expected to have a stronger interaction between the cold / hot gases , such as the case of ngc  5866 ( paper  i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cold gas mainly distributes in the outer region , as for the case of the ring of ngc  1291 , the cold / hot gas interaction then tends to be less significant ( irwin et al .",
    "however , the amount and spatial distribution of the cold gas seem to be dependent on other parameters , such as the origin of the gas ( internal or external ) , the merger and sf history etc .",
    "( e.g. , sage & welch 2006 ; combes et al . 2007 ; crocker et al .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of this paper , but they may contribute to the large scatter of the cold / hot gas relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coldm_lx ] ) .",
    "clearly , more x - ray and radio observations are needed to test the above scenario .",
    "in particular , accurate measurement of the hot gas temperature can be very helpful , as it is a direct measurement of the specific energy .",
    "currently the uncertainties in the counting statistics of the data are too large to tightly constrain the temperature ( the errors listed in table  [ table : hotgas ] are only the fitting error ) .",
    "in addition , measurements of the cold gas with improved sensitivity are also needed .",
    "to study the hot gas properties and cold - hot gas relation in s0 galaxies , we have conducted a careful analysis of the _ chandra _ data of five nearby isolated s0 galaxies .",
    "we quantitatively subtract various stellar contributions to reveal the truly diffuse hot gas emission , and further compare the results to those of early - type galaxies from relevant recent papers .",
    "the isolated s0 galaxies studied in the present work are all x - ray faint , with the soft x - ray luminosity of the hot gas typically accounting for @xmath1 of the type  ia sn energy injection rate .",
    "such a low cooling rate indicates the presence of a galactic superwind or subsonic outflow .",
    "the hot gas luminosity of a massive s0 galaxy tends to be lower than that of an elliptical galaxy of the same stellar mass , consistent with previous observational and theoretical works .",
    "however , at the low mass end , this difference is not significant .",
    "@xmath3 , which roughly describes the residual of the @xmath66 relation ( the slope of the @xmath76 relation is @xmath77 from the analysis in this work ) or the relative richness of the hot gas in early - type galaxies , tends to correlate positively with the total cold gas mass ( @xmath4 ) for cold - gas - poor galaxies with @xmath5 , while they anti - correlate with each other for cold - gas - rich galaxies .",
    "this cold - hot gas relation , together with the different hot gas properties for e and s0 galaxies , may contribute to the large scatter of the @xmath66 relation .",
    "we further speculate a scenario to explain the overall cold - hot gas relation , assuming an early - type galaxy with a significant amount of leftover gas from a star forming precursor evolves without replenishment of external cold gas .",
    "initially , the observed x - ray luminosity increases with time primarily due to the decreasing sn energy input rate and hot gas specific energy after the major starburst epoch .",
    "this stage corresponds to a relatively cold - gas - rich phase of the galaxies or the anti - correlation part of the cold - hot gas relation . in the late evolutionary stage",
    ", however , the x - ray luminosity increases with time due to the decreasing mass input rate from the mass loading of the cold gas into the hot phase .",
