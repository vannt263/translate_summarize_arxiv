    "transmutation operators also called operators of transformation are a widely used tool in the theory of linear differential equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that under certain quite general conditions the transmutation operator transmuting the operator @xmath1 into @xmath2 is a volterra integral operator with good properties . its integral kernel",
    "can be obtained as a solution of a certain goursat problem for the klein - gordon equation with a variable coefficient . in particular ,",
    "the elementary solutions of the equation @xmath3 are transformed into the solutions of the equation @xmath4 .",
    "if the integral kernel of the transmutation operator is unknown , and usually this is the case , there is no way to apply it to an arbitrary smooth function .",
    "this obstacle strongly restricts the application of the transmutation operators confining it to purely theoretical purposes .",
    "recently , in @xcite a relation of the transmutation operators with another fundamental object of the sturm - liouville theory was revealed .",
    "sometimes this object is called the @xmath5-basis @xcite where @xmath5 refers to a corresponding linear ordinary differential operator .",
    "the @xmath5-basis is an infinite family of functions @xmath6 such that @xmath7 for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , for @xmath10 and all @xmath11 satisfy certain prescribed initial conditions . in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite it was shown that the @xmath5-basis naturally arises in a representation of the solutions of the sturm - liouville equation in terms of powers of the spectral parameter . the approach based on such representation is called the spectral parameter power series ( spps ) method .",
    "the functions @xmath11 which constitute the @xmath5-basis appear as the expansion coefficients in the spps . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite convenient representations for their practical computation",
    "were proposed which converted the spps method into an efficient and highly competitive technique for solving a variety of spectral and scattering problems related to sturm - liouville equations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the above mentioned relation between the transmutation operators and the functions @xmath11 called in the present paper the recursive integrals consists in the fact established in @xcite that for every system @xmath6 there exists a transmutation operator @xmath12 such that @xmath13=\\varphi_{k}$ ] , i.e. , the functions @xmath11 are the images of the usual powers of the independent variable .",
    "moreover , it was shown how this operator can be constructed and how it is related to the canonical  transformation operator considered , e.g. , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) . this result",
    "together with the practical formulas for calculating the functions @xmath11 makes it possible to apply the transmutation technique even when the integral kernel of the operator is unknown . indeed , now it is easy to apply the transmutation operator to any function approximated by a polynomial .",
    "deeper understanding of the mapping properties of the transmutation operators led us in @xcite to the explicit construction of the transmutation operator for a darboux transformed schrdinger operator by a known transmutation operator for the original schrdinger operator as well as to several interesting relations between the two transmutation operators .",
    "these relations also allowed us to prove the main theorem on the transmutation operators under a weaker condition than it was known before ( not requiring the continuous differentiablity of the potential in the schrdinger operator ) .",
    "in the present paper we overview the recent results related to the spps approach explaining and illustrating its main advantage , the possibility to write down in an analytic form the characteristic equation of the spectral problem .",
    "this equation can be approximated in different ways , and its solutions give us the eigenvalues of the problem .",
    "in other words the eigenvalue problem reduces to computation of zeros of a certain complex analytic function given by its taylor series whose coefficients are obtained as simple linear combinations of the values of the functions @xmath11 at a given point .",
    "we discuss different applications of the spps method and give the results of some comparative numerical calculations .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we introduce a parametrized family of transmutation operators and study their mapping properties , we give an explicit representation for the kernel of the transmutation operator corresponding to the darboux transformed potential in terms of the transmutation kernel for its superpartner ( theorem [ th t2volterra ] ) .",
    "moreover , this result leads to interesting commutation relations between the two transmutation operators ( corollary [ cor commutation relations ] ) which in their turn allow us to obtain a transmutation operator for the one - dimensional dirac system with a scalar potential as well as to prove the main property of the transmutation operator under less restrictive conditions than it has been proved until now .",
    "we give several examples of explicitly constructed kernels of transmutation operators .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the literature there are very few explicit examples and even in the case when @xmath14 is a constant such kernel was presented recently in @xcite .",
    "the results discussed in the present paper allow us to enlarge considerably the list of available examples and give a relatively simple tool for constructing darboux related sequences of the transmutation kernels .",

    "slightly more general families of functions can be studied in relation to sturm - liouville equations of the form @xmath40 .",
    "their definition based on a corresponding recursive integration procedure is given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we introduce the infinite system of functions @xmath41 defined as follows @xmath42    the system ( [ phik ] ) is closely related to the notion of the @xmath5-basis introduced and studied in @xcite . here the letter @xmath5 corresponds to a linear ordinary differential operator .",
    "together with the system of functions ( [ phik ] ) we define the functions @xmath43 using the second half  of the recursive integrals and , @xmath44 the following result obtained in @xcite ( for additional details and simpler proof see @xcite and @xcite ) establishes the relation of the system of functions @xmath41 and @xmath45 to the sturm - liouville equation .",
    "[ @xcite][thgensolsturmliouville ] let @xmath14 be a continuous complex valued function of an independent real variable @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath46 be an arbitrary complex number .",
    "suppose there exists a solution @xmath47 of the equation @xmath48 on @xmath18 such that @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16  for any @xmath17 $ ]",
    ". then the general solution @xmath49 $ ] of the equation @xmath50 on @xmath18 has the form@xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are arbitrary complex constants , @xmath54 and both series converge uniformly on @xmath55 $ ] together with the series of the first derivatives which have the form@xmath56 the series of the second derivatives converge uniformly on any segment@xmath57\\subset(a , b)$ ] .",
    "the representation ( [ u1u2 ] ) offers the linearly independent solutions of ( [ sllambda ] ) in the form of spectral parameter power series ( spps ) .",
    "the possibility to represent solutions of the sturm - liouville equation in such form is by no means a novelty , though it is not a widely used tool ( in fact , besides the work reviewed below and in @xcite we are able to mention only ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) , @xcite and the recent paper @xcite ) and to our best knowledge for the first time it was applied for solving spectral problems in @xcite .",
    "the reason of this underuse of the spps lies in the form in which the expansion coefficients were sought . indeed , in previous works the calculation of coefficients was proposed in terms of successive integrals with the kernels in the form of iterated green functions ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect . 10 ) ) .",
    "this makes any computation based on such representation difficult , less practical and even proofs of the most basic results like , e.g. , the uniform convergence of the spectral parameter power series for any value of @xmath58 ( established in theorem [ thgensolsturmliouville ] ) are not an easy task .",
    "for example , in @xcite the parameter @xmath46 is assumed to be small and no proof of convergence is given .",
    "the way of how the expansion coefficients in ( [ u1u2 ] ) are calculated according to ( [ xn ] ) , ( [ xtiln ] ) is relatively simple and straightforward , this is why the estimation of the rate of convergence of the series ( [ u1u2 ] ) presents no difficulty , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite a discrete analogue of theorem [ thgensolsturmliouville ] was established and the discrete analogues of the series ( [ u1u2 ] ) resulted to be finite sums .",
    "another crucial feature of the introduced representation of the expansion coefficients in ( [ u1u2 ] ) consists in the fact that not only these coefficients ( denoted by @xmath11 in ( [ phik ] ) ) are required for solving different spectral problems related to the sturm - liouville equation .",
    "indeed , the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 do not participate explicitly in the representation ( [ u1u2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , together with the functions @xmath11 they appear in the representation of the derivatives of the solutions and therefore also in characteristic equations corresponding to the spectral problems .    in the present work we also overview another approach developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite where the formal powers ( [ xn ] ) and ( [ xtiln ] ) were considered as infinite families of functions intimately related to the corresponding sturm - liouville operator .",
    "as we show this leads to a deeper understanding of the transmutation operators @xcite , @xcite also known as transformation operators @xcite , @xcite .",
    "indeed , the functions @xmath62 result to be the images of the powers @xmath63 under the action of a corresponding transmutation operator @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to apply the transmutation operator even when the operator itself is unknown ( and this is the usual situation  very few explicit examples are available ) due to the fact that its action on every polynomial is known .",
    "this result was used in @xcite and @xcite  to prove the completeness ( runge - type approximation theorems ) for families of solutions of two - dimensional schrdinger and dirac equations with variable complex - valued coefficients .",

    "theorem [ thgensolsturmliouville ] together with the results on the completeness of sturm - liouville eigenfunctions and generalized eigenfunctions @xcite implies the validity of the following two statements . for their detailed proofs",

    "the spps representation ( [ u1u2 ] ) for solutions of the sturm - liouville equation ( [ sllambda ] ) is very convenient for writing down the dispersion ( characteristic ) relations in an analytical form .",

    "<S> we give an overview of recent developments in sturm - liouville theory concerning operators of transmutation ( transformation ) and spectral parameter power series ( spps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to write down the dispersion ( characteristic ) equations corresponding to a variety of spectral problems related to sturm - liouville equations in an analytic form is an attractive feature of the spps method . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a computation of certain systems of recursive integrals . considered as families of functions these systems </S>",
    "<S> are complete in the @xmath0-space and result to be the images of the nonnegative integer powers of the independent variable under the action of a corresponding transmutation operator . </S>",
    "<S> this recently revealed property of the delsarte transmutations opens the way to apply the transmutation operator even when its integral kernel is unknown and gives the possibility to obtain further interesting properties concerning the darboux transformed schrdinger operators .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the systems of recursive integrals and the spps approach , explain some of its applications to spectral problems with numerical illustrations , give the definition and basic properties of transmutation operators , introduce a parametrized family of transmutation operators , study their mapping properties and construct the transmutation operators for darboux transformed schrdinger operators . </S>"
