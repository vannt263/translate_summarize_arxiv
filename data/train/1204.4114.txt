    "it has been realised over the past decade that the black hole at the centre of a galaxy bulge is no mere ornament but may play a major role in determining the final stellar mass of the bulge . the process by which this occurs is known as agn ( active galactic nucleus ) feedback and it takes place through an interaction between the energy and radiation generated by accretion onto the massive black hole ( the agn ) and the gas in the host galaxy .",
    "the possibility arises where the intense flux of photons and particles produced by the agn sweeps the galaxy bulge clean of interstellar gas , terminates star formation , and through lack of fuel for accretion , terminates the agn .",
    "the ratio of the size of the black hole to its massive host galaxy is tiny and similar to a coin in comparison to the earth .",
    "the feedback process must therefore operate over a hundred to thousand millionfold range of scale ( i.e. @xmath0 ) .",
    "the details of the feedback are complex and the observational evidence is not always clear .",
    "the overall picture in terms of energetics is fairly straightforward and at least two major modes have been identified , differentiated by the nature of the energy outflow near the black hole .",
    "the first is the _ radiative _ mode , also known as the quasar or wind mode , which operates , or operated , in a typical bulge when the accreting black hole was close to the eddington limit .",
    "it is most concerned with pushing cold gas about .",
    "the second mode is the _ kinetic _",
    "mode , also known as the radio jet , or maintenance mode .",
    "this typically operates when the galaxy has a hot halo ( or is at the centre of a group or cluster of galaxies ) and the accreting black hole has powerful jets . at the present epoch it tends to occur at a lower eddington fraction and in more massive galaxies and",
    "involves hot gas .",
    "a further , ill - understood , mode may be associated with giant radio sources , which range in size up to a few mpc .",
    "the energies in these sources are prodigious and approach the binding energy of the gas in groups and subclusters .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that the growth of the central black hole by accretion can have a profound effect on its host galaxy .",
    "if the velocity dispersion of the galaxy is @xmath1 then the binding energy of the galaxy bulge , which is of mass @xmath2 is @xmath3 .",
    "the mass of the black hole is typically observed to be @xmath4 ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . assuming a radiative efficiency for the accretion process of 10% , then the energy released by the growth of the black hole is given by @xmath5 .",
    "therefore @xmath6 most galaxies have @xmath7 so @xmath8 .",
    "the energy produced by the growth of the black hole therefore exceeds the binding energy by a large factor .",
    "if even a small fraction of the energy can be transferred to the gas , then an agn can have a profound effect on the evolution of its host galaxy .",
    "fortunately accretion energy does not significantly affect the stars already existing in the host galaxy , or there would not be any galaxies as we know them .",
    "nevertheless , observational evidence is reviewed here that energy and momentum from accretion onto the central black hole can couple strongly with the gas from which new stars forms .",
    "agn feedback is a relatively young topic and a wide range of argument and opinion has been expressed .",
    "one opinion holds that agn feedback locks the mass of the black hole to that of its host galaxy bulge , and determines the ultimate stellar mass of the bulge .",
    "another opinion has it as just one of many processes of comparable importance in galaxy evolution ; with the black hole  galaxy bulge mass correlation merely being a result of repeated mergers ( e.g. jahnke & macci 2011 ) .",
    "there is little or no evidence at the present time for agn feedback operating in low mass galaxies where stellar feedback is important , or that it significantly affects galaxy disks , or pseudobulges .",
    "the clearest observational evidence for agn feedback is found in the most massive galaxies known , brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in cool core clusters of galaxies . without energy input through kinetic feedback ,",
    "many bcgs would be yet more massive and appear as brilliant , giant starbursts .",
    "agn feedback features in many theoretical , numerical and semi - analytic simulations of galaxy growth and evolution ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; granato et al 2004 ; di matteo et al 2005 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ; bower et al 2006 ; croton et al 2006 ; ciotti et al 2010 ; hopkins et al 2006 , scannapieco et al 2011 ) .",
    "they are not reviewed here .",
    "the 9 orders of magnitude in physical scale means that all such simulations include subgrid assumptions and approximations .",
    "the review begins with a brief outline of the physics behind the radiative mode , then discusses the effects of radiation pressure on dusty gas , followed by agn winds , outflows and agn evolution .",
    "the radiative mode is the most likely agn feedback explanation for the black hole mass  stellar velocity dispersion relation ( @xmath9 , see section 2 ) , since it relies on the accretion being radiatively efficient and close to the eddington limit .",
    "it was probably most effective back at @xmath10 when quasar activity peaked and galaxies were most gas rich .",
    "much of the feedback action involves absorption of the quasar radiation , which obscures the agn itself , so direct observational evidence is patchy at the moment",
    ".    if feedback empties a massive galaxy of gas it will then refill with at least stellar mass loss if isolated , or with intracluster plasma if in a cluster or group . keeping it empty , or at least keeping the gas hot",
    "so it does not cool , appears to be the role of the kinetic mode , which is discussed next .",
    "this mode gives the most dramatic observational examples of agn feedback in terms of bubbles in the cores of clusters .",
    "energy injection from powerful giant radio galaxies is treated last .",
    "this may have a drastic impact on the gas in groups and subclusters .",
    "observational evidence is poor , however , since much of the power in relativistic electrons ( but not protons ) is lost in compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background , the energy density of which was much higher in the past .",
    "the review finishes by considering whether the long term behaviour of agn , and the modes of accretion , parallels the outbursts of galactic , stellar mass , binary black holes which tend to be radiatively efficient and windy at high luminosity , and radiatively inefficient and jetted at low luminosity .",
    "future observational prospects for agn feedback , which are very bright , are treated in a concluding section .",
    "silk & rees ( 1998 , see also haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ) pointed out that a quasar at the eddington limit can prevent accretion into a galaxy at the maximum possible rate provided that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the thomson cross section for electron scattering and @xmath13 is the fraction of the galaxy mass in gas .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to be isothermal with radius @xmath14 , so that its mass is @xmath15 the maximum collapse rate , @xmath16 , is equivalent to the gas content , @xmath17 , collapsing on a freefall time , @xmath18 , requiring a power of @xmath19 to balance it which is limited by the eddington luminosity @xmath20 .",
    "the argument is based on energy which is necessary but may not be sufficient for ejecting matter ( the rocket equation , for example , is based on momentum ) .",
    "momentum balance gives an expression ( fabian 1999 , fabian , wilman & crawford 2002 , king 2003 , 2005 , murray , quataert & thompson 2005 ) @xmath21 which is about @xmath22 times larger and in striking agreement with the observed black hole mass vs stellar velocity disperson ( @xmath23 ) relation ( e.g. gltekin et al 2009 ) for a plausible gas mass fraction @xmath24 .",
    "there are several ways to derive the above formula .",
    "a simple one is to assume that the radiation pressure from the eddington - limited quasar @xmath25 has swept the gas , of mass @xmath26 to the edge of the galaxy .",
    "balancing the outward radiation force with the inward one due to gravity gives @xmath27 i.e. @xmath28 from which the result follows .",
    "the cancellation of the radius in the formula means it applies within the galaxy .",
    "the agreement that this simple formula gives with the observed @xmath29 relation can be interpreted as ( weak ) observational evidence for agn feedback .",
    "the interaction can not rely on radiation pressure on electrons as in the standard eddington - limit formula , since if the quasar is locally at its eddington limit then it must be far below the eddington limit when the mass of the galaxy is included .",
    "quasars appear to respect the eddington limit , see e.g. kollmeier ( 2006 ) and steinhardt & elvis ( 2010 ) .",
    "( king 2003 does however invoke super - eddington luminosities . )",
    "the interaction has to be much stronger , either due to a wind generated close to the quasar which then flows through the galaxy pushing the gas out , or to dust embedded in the gas , as expected for the interstellar medium of a galaxy ( laor & draine 1993 , scoville & norman 1995 , murray , quartaert & thompson 2005 ) .",
    "dust grains embedded in the gas will be partially charged in the energetic environment of a quasar , which binds them to the surrounding partially - ionized gas .",
    "@xmath30 is reduced by a factor of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the equivalent dust cross section per proton , appropriately weighted for the dust content of the gas and the spectrum of the quasar .",
    "we find that @xmath33 is about 1000 for a gas with a galactic dust - to - gas ratio exposed to a typical quasar spectrum ( fabian , vasudevan & gandhi 2008a ) , dropping to 500 for low eddington ratio objects .",
    "this means that a quasar at the standard eddington limit ( for ionized gas ) is at the effective eddington limit ( for dusty gas ) , @xmath34 of a surrounding object 1000 times more massive .",
    "both agn and galaxy are then at their respective eddington limits .",
    "is this just a coincidence or the underlying reason why @xmath35 ?",
    "agn show indications of an effective eddington limit in the distribution of absorption column densities , @xmath36 as a function of eddington ratio , @xmath37 found in several surveys ( raimundo et al 2010 ) .",
    "there is a lack of objects with column densities , @xmath36 in the range @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is unlikely to be an observational selection effect since such objects would be x - ray bright .",
    "any object found in that zone would be of great interest as it could test radiative feedback on dust .",
    "the gas should be outflowing .",
    "interstellar gas in an agn host evolves such that any which strays into a region where @xmath40 is pushed outwarde .",
    "gas which is introduced to a galaxy can remain , fuelling both the black hole and star formation , provided both @xmath41 and @xmath30 remain below unity .",
    "repitition of this process could drive @xmath42 .",
    "if the repeated action of radiation pressure on dust is responsible for the @xmath43 relation then it must cause the bulge mass to be @xmath33 times the black hole mass , @xmath44 for a constant mass - to - light ratio , this corresponds to the faber ",
    "jackson ( 1976 ) relation .",
    "since @xmath45 , then @xmath46 feedback should shape both the black hole and the galaxy bulge and may even lead to some aspects ( e.g. @xmath47 ) of the fundamental plane ( faber et al 1987 ; djorgovski et al 1987 ) .",
    "( it is curious that the above value for @xmath48 is close to the fiducial acceleration @xmath49 in mond theory ( sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) .",
    "galaxies occur in dark matter haloes , which define the outer gravitational potential well .",
    "the total mass of the halo can be an order of magnitude more than that of the stellar part of the galaxy .",
    "silk & nusser ( 2010 ) have shown that agn feedback may not be energetic enough to eject all the gas from the halo , as well as the galaxy , if the gas moves at the ( local ) escape velocity .    in the speculative process described above",
    ", where cycles of agn activity push the gas out of the galaxy , then the gas may end up trapped in the halo .",
    "it is plausible however that the squeezing of the gas during the ejection process triggers star formation , leading to shells of stars on ever larger ( bound ) radial orbits as the galaxy grows .",
    "this inside - out growth pattern superficially matches observations of the development of the radii of early - type galaxies since @xmath50 ( van dokkum et al 2010 ) just after quasar activity had peaked .",
    "the above discussion assumes that the infrared radiation produced by the absorption of quasar radiation by dust is not heavily trapped .",
    "if it is then the net radiation pressure is increased proportional to the optical depth , and the relationships become more complicated .",
    "the bulk of quasar radiation originates from an accretion disc and has a bipolar radiation pattern .",
    "this both allows accretion to proceed along the disc plane , fuelled by mergers , cold flows , or just secular evolution of the galaxy , while at the same time pushing matter out strongly along the disc axis .",
    "gas in the body of the galaxy at 100  pc or more will be mostly swept up along that axis , the gap around the equator preventing significant large - scale trapping of the radiation .",
    "this means that galaxies growing under strong radiation feedback as envisaged above could appear elongated along the radiation axis .",
    "if the main interaction is due to winds , not to radiation pressure , then the wind needs to have a high column density @xmath51 , high velocity @xmath52 , high covering fraction @xmath13 , all at large radius @xmath14 .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of a wind is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gravitational radius @xmath55 and @xmath56 for high wind power , @xmath57 , then if @xmath58 then values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are needed .",
    "if the wind is pressure driven then it might be expected that the gas is accelerated where @xmath52 is the local escape velocity so @xmath61 .    to produce @xmath62 scaling the thrust of the wind needs to be proportional to the eddington limit .",
    "this seems plausible if the wind is dusty or the acceleration is due to radiation pressure acting on resonance lines in the gas .",
    "a problem with a high velocity dust - driven wind is that dust is unlikely to survive close to the black hole where the escape velocity is high .",
    "it is not clear that wind strength is proportional to the eddington limit if the wind is accelerated magnetically by , say , the blandford - payne ( 1982 ) mechanism .",
    "the commonest way in which agn winds are observed is by line absorption of the quasar continuum by intervening wind material .",
    "the x - ray warm absorbers commonly seen in seyfert galaxies ( reynolds 1997 , crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) flowing at @xmath63 are insufficient , by a large factor ( blustin et al 2005 ) .",
    "faster winds are required , such as those seen in uv observations of bal quasars ( e.g. ganguly et al 2007 ; weymann et al 1991 ) and in x - ray observations of some agn ( e.g. pounds et al 2003 ; reeves et al 2009 ; tombesi et al 2010 , fig .  1 ) , with velocities of tens of thousands of @xmath64 .",
    "establishing that the kinetic power of the wind is sufficient has proven difficult : if the evidence of the wind is from blueshifted absorption lines then obtaining the covering fraction and radius of the wind requires indirect arguments .",
    "tombesi et al ( 2012 ) estimate that the mass outflow rate exceeds 5% of the mass accretion rate and that the lower limit on the kinetic power of the outflows in individual objects ranges from @xmath65 .",
    "( reeves et al 2009 ) .",
    "note the 9  kev absorption feature in the rest frame of the quasar , presumed to be due to fexxv ( rest frame 6.7  kev ) blueshifted by 0.3 .",

    "this is backed up by a range of less direct estimates .",
    "an understanding of the overall effect of powerful winds also requires estimates of their longevity .",
    "generally , good evidence for agn winds occurs in unobscured agn , where the uv spectrum can be directly seen .",
    "there is then little cold gas along our line of sight in the host galaxy to be swept out , either because this has already occured or there is little cold gas in the first place .",
    "where significant cold gas is present in the galaxy , the intrinsic agn spectrum may be blocked from view and feedback is inferred from the velocity field of any outflow in the galaxy .",
    "evidence of agn feedback is clearly seen in some galactic outflows . galactic winds and starburst superwinds ( veilleux , cecil & bland - hawthorn 2005 ;",
    "heckman et al 2000 , strickland & heckman 2009 ; weiner at al 2009 ) can range from tens to over a thousand solar masses per year with velocities of a few 100@xmath64 for the cool components .",
    "most of the lower velocity winds are considered to be powered by stellar processes such as supernovae .",
    "identifying the effects of agn feedback in outflows often relies on observing higher velocity ( e.g. @xmath66 ) components and an outflow power exceeding that predicted by any central starburst .",
    "the details are not easy to discern , nor is there yet a simple clear dividing line between star- and agn - driven outflows .",
    "@xmath67 is @xmath68 per particle and difficult to achieve with stellar processes in large masses of cold molecular gas .",
    "there should of course be a powerful agn at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "high accretion requires a high fuelling rate which often leads to high obscuration of the agn .",
    "the obscuration by the surrounding gas , makes observations of the uv and soft x - ray bands where absorption features are most readily detected , more difficult .",
    "an important object where both the agn and outflow are seen is the low redshift , @xmath69 quasar / merger mrk231 .",
    "rupke & veilleux ( 2011 ; fig .",
    "1 ) map a strong outflow in it with a velocity of @xmath70 and an outflow rate of @xmath71 , several times greater than the star formation rate .",
    "the outflow power is about one per cent of the bolometric luminosity of the agn ( see also ferruglio et al 2010 ; fischer et al 2010 ) .",
    "the optical / uv spectrum of mrk231 shows that it is a low ionization bal ( lobal ) quasar with strong additional absorption ( smith et al 1995 ) .",
    "a study of felobal quasars at @xmath72 by farrah et al ( 2012 ) concludes that radiatively driven outflows from agn act to curtail obscured star formation ( inferred from the ir luminosity ) in the host galaxies of reddened quasars to less than @xmath73% of the total ir luminosity .",
    "sturm et al ( 2011 ) have used herschel - pacs to observe the far - infrared spectrum of the oh 79@xmath74 m feature in several low redshift ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "they find high velocities above @xmath75 and mass outflow rates of up to @xmath76 in the agn dominant ones .",
    "the gas depletion times range from @xmath77 .",
    "their result leaves little doubt that massive outflows are generated by agn .",
    "there are many recent reports of outflows from galaxies hosting agn .",
    "@xmath75 outflows have been seen either side of an obscured quasar at @xmath78 ( greene , zakamska & smith 2011 ) , in massive post - starburst galaxies at @xmath79 ( tremonti , moustakas & diamond - stanic 2007 ) , and covering 48  kpc of an ultra luminous infrared galaxy hosting an agn at @xmath50 ( alexander et al 2010 ) .",
    "a region over a luminous quasar at @xmath80 shows star formation suppressed , as inferred from decreased h@xmath81 emission , where the outflow velocity , deduced from [ oiii ] emission , is highest ( cano - daz et al 2011 ) .",
    "absorption features in the spectrum of a background quasar shining through the halo 108  kpc out from a @xmath80 quasar reveal extreme kinematics in metal - rich cold gas ( prochaska & hennawi 2009 ) .    a spectacular example is the @xmath82 outflow in a redshift 6.4 quasar revealed by broad wings of the [ cii ] emission line ( maiolino et al 2012 ) .",
    "the kinetic power in the outflow is @xmath83 and the @xmath84 molecular gas content of the host galaxy , inferred by co observation , is ejected in @xmath85 .",
    "strong outflows are also seen in radio galaxies at both low ( e.g. morganti et al 2007 ) and high redshifts ( nesvadba et al 2008 , 2011 ) .",
    "the above results are a foretaste of what can be expected over the next few years as instrumentation and techniques improve .",
    "an important discovery of the past decade was the cosmic downsizing of agn .",
    "the most luminous and massive agn were most numerous at redshifts of 22.5 , the less - luminous peaked at successively lower redshifts with the least luminous peaking around redshift one .",
    "downsizing of agn was first seen in x - ray surveys ( ueda et al 2003 , hasinger , miyaji & schmidt 2005 ; barger et al 2005 ) where the nucleus stands out clearly above the surrounding galaxy in even the low - luminosity objects .",
    "later work in optical and other bands confirms this picture .",
    "downsizing is also see in radio agn ( rigby et al 2011 ) .",
    "the behaviour is the opposite of what is simply predicted in a hierarchical cdm universe , where the most massive objects ( clusters of galaxies ) form last .",
    "it indicates that something is quenching quasar behaviour and the most widely accepted solution is that it is due to agn feedback . in many models ,",
    "massive galaxies merge to generate a massive black hole surrounded by dense gas .",
    "the gas feeds both star formation and an active nucleus ( e.g. sanders et al 1988 ) .",
    "the power of the agn blows the gas away leaving a red , dead elliptical galaxy ( e.g. springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) .",
    "studies of the colours of elliptical galaxies indicate that galaxies move on a colour  magnitude diagram from the blue cloud of star forming galaxies to the red cloud of dead ones .",
    "interestingly most of the hosts of agn are found in the `` green valley '' between these two extremes ( nandra et al 2007 ; schawinski et al 2007 ) .",
    "the rate at which the galaxies have changed in colour can be deduced from post - starburst signatures in their spectra , and appears to be a few 100 million years , significantly faster than would be expected from passive evolution , where stellar mass loss would accumulate and lead to late star formation .",
    "the observational details of this are however uncertain in local galaxy bulges ( wild , heckman & charlot 2010 ) , with signs that the black hole fuelling may lag behind the starburst ( see hopkins 2011 for a model ) .",
    "bell et al ( 2011 ) studying massive galaxies from @xmath86 find quiescence to correlate poorly with stellar mass",
    ". a common factor of a quiescent galaxy is that it has a bulge , with presumably a central black hole consistent with black hole feedback .",
    "a possibly important uncertainty on distant agn hosts is whether they are dusty or not ( e.g. brammer et al 2009 ) . correcting for dust may remove most agn from the green valley altogether ( cardamone et al 2010 ) .",
    "many theoretical models for quasar evolution are based on galaxy - galaxy mergers being the trigger for gas infall onto a black hole .",
    "( this is a convenient assumption since the merger rate is predictable from the growth of large - scale dark matter structure . )",
    "although mergers must occur , the evidence for them triggering agn is weak at most redshifts .",
    "searches for post - merger disruption signatures often give a null result when the host galaxies of agn are compared with a control sample of field galaxies ( e.g cisternas et al 2011 ; schawinski et al 2011 ) .",
    "mergers are best seen as a trigger for distant submillimetre galaxies ( smg , tacconi et al 2008 ; engel et al 2010 ; riechers et al 2011 ) and some local seyferts ( koss et al 2010 ) . secular processes may nevertheless dominate gas inflow in massive bulges at @xmath87 ( genzel et al 2009 )",
    ".    the evidence is building that between redshifts of 2 and the current epoch , much of the evolution of agn is secular ( kocevski et al 2011 , orban de xivry et al 2011 ) .",
    "further evidence for this emerges from a study of the probability that a galaxy hosts an agn .",
    "aird et al ( 2011 ) find this to be a power - law in eddington rate , and largely independent of mass ( see also kauffmann & heckman 2009 for a discussion of eddington ratios at low redshift and alexander & hickox 2011 for a review of black hole growth ) .",
    "secular evolution has implications for the spin of black holes , which are then likely to be high ( berti & volonteri 2007 ) .",
    "hints that most accretion takes place onto spinning black holes , with consequent high radiative efficiency , @xmath88 , have emerged from application of soltan s ( 1982 ) argument relating the energy density of quasar / agn radiation to the local mean mass density in massive black holes .",

    "the picture emerging from many observations of massive galaxies and agn is of radiative feedback being an important process when the agn / quasar was highly luminous and within about two orders of magnitude of the eddington limit . for massive galaxies , this highlights the redshift range of the quasar peak .",

    "the high pressure environment in a cluster core , where the thermal pressure is about 1000 times that of the interstellar medium of the milky way has been invoked as an explanation for low mass stars , due to its effect on the jeans mass ( fabian et al 1982 ) .",

    "van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ) do however find an imf rich in low - mass stars in a small sample of nearby elliptical galaxies ( see also cappellari et al 2012 ) , so the case may not yet be completely closed for low - mass stars playing a role .",
    "the centres of a1835 and the perseus cluster do contain extensive reservoirs of dusty atomic and molecular gas , the mass of which could be the end result of a significant cooling flow , except that it would not then be clear where the dust and molecules formed .",

    "dust formation from cold molecular gas has been proposed in this situation ( fabian , johnstone & daines 1994 ) but no detailed calculation has been attempted .",
    "the situation may change now that significant amounts of dust and molecules have been found in some very young supernova remnants , such as sn1987a ( matsuura et al 2011 ) and the crab ( loh , baldwin & ferland et al 2011 ) .",
    "xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer observations provided crucial information against a simple cooling flow model in that they failed to show the strong lines expected from fexvii as the gas cooled below 0.7  kev ( peterson et al 2001 ; tamura et al 2001 ) .",
    "detailed fits ( peterson et al 2003 ) indicated that there was much less gas below one third of the outer cluster gas temperature than would be expected in a steady cooling flow . either something was heating the gas , or the gas was somehow disappearing .",
    "as will be discussed below , both of these options are probably involved .",
    "the likely heat source is the agn in the bcg at the centre of the cool core .",
    "almost all have an active radio source ( burns 1990 , sun 2010 ) .",
    "heating by the central agn was suggested early by pedlar et al ( 1990 ) , baum & odea ( 1991 ) , tabor & binney ( 1994 ) and tucker & david ( 1997 ) .",
    "later work shows that the correlation between radio power and cooling luminosity ( a measure of the rate at which gas cools within a fiducial cooling radius where @xmath106 is 7  gyr ) is poor ( voigt & fabian 2004 ) and the jets and thus the kinetic power either has to be highly sporadic or extremely radiatively inefficient ( see later ) .",
    "the general consensus now is that the massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy is feeding energy back into its surroundings at a rate balancing the loss of energy through cooling ( for reviews see peterson & fabian 2006 , mcnamara & nulsen 2007 , cattaneo et al 2009 ) .",
    "several steps in this feedback process are clearly seen in x - ray and radio observations .",
    "much of the action is spatially resolved and the gas optically thin .",
    "the accretion flow onto the black hole generates powerful jets which inflate bubbles of relativistic plasma either side of the nucleus .",
    "the bubbles are buoyant in the intracluster or intragroup medium , separating and rising as a new bubble forms ( churazov et al 2000 ; mcnamara et al 2000 ) .",
    "a study of the brightest 55 clusters ( fig .  3",
    "; dunn & fabian 2006 , 2008 ) originally showed that over 70% of those clusters where the cooling time is less than 3  gyr , therefore needing heat , have bubbles ; the remaining 30% have a central radio source .",
    "this implies that the duty cycle of the bubbling is at least @xmath107 .",
    "updating that work now indicates ( fig .",
    "3 ) that the bubble fraction is @xmath108 objects ( the odd one out  the ophiuchus cluster  is undergoing a merger into the core ) .",
    "when projection effects are considered , since bubbles along the line of sight will be difficult to distinguish , the corresponding bubbling fraction is @xmath109% . note that objects can not shift to the left in this diagram on timescales less than @xmath106 ; they can shift to the right on a shorter timescale but this must be rare or there would not be a peak at low @xmath106 .",
    "_ the jet bubbling process is not therefore very episodic , but is more or less continuous . _",
    "the kinetic power in the jets can be estimated from the product of the volume of the bubbles ( fig .",
    "4 ) , and the surrounding pressure ( obtained from the density and temperature of the thermal gas ) , divided by the buoyancy time ( which depends on the gravitational potential ) .",
    "the power is high and only weakly correlated with radio power ( the radiative efficiency of many jets is very low at between @xmath110 ) .",
    "the power is usually in good agreement with the energy loss by x - radiation from the short - cooling - time region ( fig .  5 , mcnamara & nulsen 2007 , rafferty et al 2006 , 2008 ) .",

    "type i radio source usually coincides neatly with the cavity .",
    "the idea that a radio source could blow bubbles in the icm dates back to a paper by gull & northover ( 1973 ) .",
    "the northwest outer bubble in the perseus cluster , called a `` ghost '' bubble because of a lack of high - frequency radio synchrotron emission due to radio spectral ageing , was seen in einstein images ( branduardi - raymont et al 1981 , fabian et al 1981 ) but not recognised as such back then .",
    "the first clear image of bubbles was made using the rosat hri of the perseus cluster core by boehringer et al ( 1993 ) , followed by many observations with chandra after its launch in 1999 .",
    "as already mentioned , most cool cores in the x - ray brightest clusters with central radiative cooling times less than 3 gyr , have clear bubbles seen by chandra . allowing for projection effects , the real fraction is higher .",
    "the innermost bubbles are usually fairly spherical and in the best - studied case ( the perseus cluster ) are surrounded by a thick high - pressure region fronted by a weak shock ( fig .",
    "the thermal energy within that region corresponds to 3.7 times that of a surrounding region of similar volume to the bubble ( graham , fabian & sanders 2008 ) , indicating that bubbles can transfer almost @xmath114 , which is the internal energy expected from a relativistic fluid ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the mechanical power of a new bubble is often assumed to be @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the risetime of the bubble ( churazov et al 2002 ) .",
    "bubbles rise buoyantly in the surrounding hot atmosphere , turning into ghost bubbles as they become undetectable in ( high frequency ) radio observations .",
    "there are far fewer of these outer bubbles known , but they can appear at substantial radii and are then larger than expected ( diehl , fryer & rafferty 2008 : note the sequence of bubbles in ngc5813 shown in fig .",
    "this could be due to their rate of rise being a function of their size , i.e. larger ones move slower catching up smaller faster ones , or vice versa ( fabian et al 2011 ) . observed bubbles appear to be fairly stable to breakup , contrary to what is seen in many simulations .",
    "air bubbles in water can be quite large and stable .",
    "the action of blowing a bubble means that the surface is never static with respect to its surroundings so it is not rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "the growth time of large scale kelvin - helmholtz instabilities is similar to the flow time so this need not be a problem either .",
    "provided that something like viscosity ( reynolds et al 2005 ) or magnetic draping ( lyutikov 2006 ) can damp the smallest perturbations , then there is no immediate reason for them to break up .",
    "having enough energy available does not indicate how the energy flows and is dissipated .",
    "the coolest material is found next to the heat source , which is not what would be expected of a heat source in a room , say .",
    "the jets from the central black hole are intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "the jet / bubble axis is not apparent in temperature maps of cluster cores , so heating is presumably much more isotropic .",
    "as discussed below , linewidths show that the level of turbulence in the gas is relatively low ( energy in turbulence is less than 10 per cent of the thermal energy ) and steep abundance gradients show that there is no large scale , violent , mixing taking place .",
    "the bubbling process is relatively gentle and continuous , perhaps rather like a dripping tap ( or a fishtank aerator ) .    in the case of the perseus cluster , which is the x - ray brightest in the sky ,",
    "chandra imaging shows concentric ripples which we interpret as sound waves generated by the expansion of the central pressure peaks associated with the repetitive blowing of bubbles ( fig .  5 , fabian et al 2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "the energy flux in the sound waves is comparable to that required to offset cooling , showing that this is the likely way in which heat is distributed in a quasi - spherical manner .",
    "similar sound waves , or weak shocks , are also seen in several of the very brightest clusters in the sky , e.g. , the virgo ( fig .  8 , forman et al 2005 ) , centaurus ( sanders et al 2008 ) and a2052 ( blanton et al 2011 ) clusters and in simulations ( ruszkowski , brggen & begelman 2004 ; sijacki & springel 2006 ) . the amplitude of the ripples is less than 10 per cent , so they will be very difficult or impossible to see in less bright clusters ( graham et al 2008b ) .     of energy surrounding each inner bubble , where @xmath118 is the volume of the radio - plasma filled interior ( fabian et al 2006 ) .",

    "it is important to realise that for transport purposes , much of the relevant intracluster gas can not be classified as either collisional or collisionless but is somewhere in between .",
    "the inner parts of most cool cores show higher metal abundance that the bulk of the intracluster gas .",
    "the metallicity can reach 2 to 3 times solar values at the peak .",
    "this is considered to be due to pollution by stars and supernovae of the bcg .",
    "the spatial breadth of the high abundance region is broader than expected from a static atmospher , probably due to some turbulence and motions caused by the central agn .",
    "the existence of the peaks argues against these motions being too disruptive , or of the feedback having been too violent in the past .",
    "constraints on the level of turbulence have been obtained from comparison of the abundance peaks with the underlying bcg light profile by rebusco et al ( 2006 ) and graham et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "rising bubbles appear to have dragged some of the lower entropy , metal - enriched gas outward in some cores ( werner et al 2010 , 2011 ; simionescu et al 2009 ) .",
    "let us now consider how close the apparent heating / cooling balance is and how it has been established and maintained .",
    "the lack of high star formation rates suggests that cooling does not exceed heating by ten per cent or so .",
    "the presence of central abundance gradients and pronounced temperature drops indicates that heating does not generally exceed cooling by much either .",
    "this represents a relatively close balance which needs to continue over tens to hundreds of bubbling cycles ( each of a 1050  myr or so , depending on power ) .",
    "a simple 1d feedback cycle seems at first sight possible .",
    "if too much gas starts to cool then the accretion rate should increase making the heating rate go up and vice versa .",
    "however the lengthscales involved range over a factor of @xmath100 or more and the timescales involved over the whole cooling flow region are long , up to and beyond a gyr , and down to a myr at the accretion radius .",
    "this means that feedback would be delayed or at least that there could be serious hysteresis .",
    "angular momentum could easily prevent gas reaching anywhere near the black hole .",
    "these issues have been discussed most recently by pizzalato & soker ( 2010 ) and narayan & fabian ( 2011 ) .",
    "bondi accretion ( bondi 1957 ) could be relevant here , since it relies on a point mass embedded in a static medium .",
    "the gas accreting onto the central black hole passes at least through about 5 orders of magnitude in radius from where the gravitational field of the central mass begins to dominate gas motions , i.e. the bondi radius , to the centre .",
    "the flow itself originates further out .",
    "it is implausible that angular momentum can be ignored .",
    "one approach is to assume that the accretion flow is viscous all the way so angular momentum is efficiently transported outward at all radii .",
    "the whole inner region of radii a few 100  kpc , from beyond the bondi radius to the innermost regions where the flow becomes supersonic , could resemble a giant advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( narayan & fabian 2011 ) .",
    "this does at least allow for easy passage of the gas without it becoming choked by angular momentum .",
    "an adaf is radiatively inefficient since it transports ( advects ) the energy released in with the gas .",
    "several percent ( allen et al 2006 ) or more of the power in the accretion flow must be released into a ( radiatively inefficient jet ) close to the black hole for this hypothesis to be viable .",
    "there are indications from the observed behaviour of galactic black hole binaries ( section 4.2 ) that this can happen , although the details are poorly understood .",
    "good observations of the inner regions of the flow onto a massive black hole in a bcg are of m87 at the centre of the virgo cluster . the bondi radius there is 100200  pc , corresponding to 12 arcsec ( di matteo et al 2003 ) .",

    "it requires a much hotter incident spectrum with a 150 thousand k blackbody spectrum being suitable ( crawford & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "there is no such source of photons available , so it has been concluded that the filaments can not be excited by photons .",
    "an alternative which has been studied by ferland et al ( 2008 , 2009 ) is that cosmic rays are the source of ionization and excitation .",
    "if they penetrate cold gas then they collide with that gas and leave trails of 3040  ev secondary particles which excite a spectrum resembling the observed one . if the cold gas has denser molecular phases then the h@xmath128 and co emission is also accounted for .",
    "the required energy density in cosmic rays is high .",
    "similar secondary particles are however also produced by the incidence of kev particles , such as constitute the surrounding hot gas .",
    "this has lead to a variant of the cosmic - ray model in which the filaments are powered by interpenetration of the hot gas ( fabian et al 2011 ) .",
    "an interesting aspect of this model is that the incident flux of energy onto a filament in the perseus cluster from the surrounding gas particles is only a few times higher than the total flux emitted by the filament .",
    "this makes it energetically feasible .",
    "interpenetration does require that the magnetic fields which must help support the filaments in the hot gas ( fabian et al 2008 ) and give it integrity do not prevent the particles entering the gas .",
    "reconnection diffusion ( lazarian et al 2011 ) provides a mechanism by which this can proceed .    since particles are entering a filament , its mass is slowly increasing .",

    "direct measurements of the level of turbulence have been made from x - ray line widths using the xmm - newton rgs ( sanders et al 2010b ) .",
    "this is a slitless spectrometer which looks at a region about one arcmin across .",
    "some luminous cool core clusters above redshifts of 0.1 appear pointlike to this instrument , enabling the full spectral resolution to be obtained .",
    "several clusters including a1835 show a dozen narrow iron and ovii lines from which velocity broadening of the x - ray coolest components in the hot gas can be measured , yielding values less than @xmath139 .",
    "turbulent energy density is then less than 10 per cent of the thermal energy density .",
    "this is consistent with some simulations ( vazza et al 2009 ) . despite agn activity pumping out @xmath140 of mechanical power ,",
    "the gas flows are modest .",
    "indirect measurements have also been made .",

    "the feedback is surprisingly gentle .",
    "no evolution in cool core properties is seen in clusters out at @xmath141 ( bauer et al 2005 ; hlavacek - larrondo 2012 ) . beyond that redshift",
    "however , vikhlinin et al ( 2007 ) found no cool cores in the 400 square degree rosat survey .",
    "santos et al ( 2010 ) find some in other samples but no strong cool cores ( ie with short cooling times ) , other than one at @xmath142 ( santos et al 11 ) .",
    "can this mean rapid evolution ?",
    "the lack of observed strong cool cores may be a selection effect ( russell et al 2012 ) and due to enhanced agn activity in the bcg .",
    "generally the central agn in bcgs is quite sub - eddington ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the luminous low redshift quasar h1821 + 643 at @xmath144 in the centre of a rich cluster is a counter - example ( russell et al 2010 ) .",
    "the surrounding gas is in the same state as other cool core bcgs , including a large mass of cold molecular gas ( aravena et al 2011 ) , indicating that a powerful quasar and a cool core can co - exist .",
    "the black holes in bcg at @xmath142 may be more active than at low redshift .",
    "distant cool core clusters hosting central quasars are therefore likely . if such an object is found in an x - ray survey operating at low spatial resolution ( e.g. rosat at 20  arcsec ) , and identification is by optical spectroscopy of the brightest galaxy or object in the error box , then the object will be optically identified with the quasar alone if broad lines are seen in the spectrum .",
    "the underlying cluster could remain unnoticed if no subsequent high spatial resolution x - ray ( or optical / infrared ) deep observation is made of the quasar .",
    "3c186 ( siemigiowska et al 2010 ) and pks1229 ( russell et al 2012 ) are two examples where there appear to be strong cool cores surrounding quasars at @xmath142 .",
    "lower redshift examples are presented in crawford & fabian ( 2003 ) .    until such potential selection effects are investigated",
    "further it is difficult to speculate from observation about the evolution of cool cores .",
    "there are of course many radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies surrounded by extensive ly-@xmath81 nebulosities ( mccarthy et al 1995 , stockton , fu & canalizo 2006 ) .",
    "cool cores appear to be fairly robust to cluster mergers .",
    "observations of some merging clusters show displaced cool cores ( a168 , hallman & markevitch 2004 ; a2146 , canning et al 2012 ) .",
    "some simulations also support survival ( poole et al 2006 ) .",
    "the lack of a cool core in the coma cluster , for example , has long been attributed to a merger ( fabian et al 1984 ) .",
    "what may matter most is when the merger history of a cluster , with early mergers being the most destructive of a cool core ( burns et al 2008 ) .",
    "the most x - ray luminous cluster known , rxj1347 - 1145 with a bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath145 , is a cool core cluster , as are many other highly luminous clusters ( e.g. a1835 , zw3146 , rxcj1504.1 - 0248 and several macs clusters , hlavacek - larrondo et al 2012 ) .",
    "the feedback power in these objects exceeds @xmath140 , so is comparable to the output of a quasar , yet their nuclei are not exceptionally bright .",
    "much of the energy flow is essentially invisible .",
    "these objects are remarkably radiatively inefficient , in the accretion flow , the jet acceleration process and the jets themselves . in order that the accretion flow can be so inefficient",
    ", they probably have to operate in the adaf regime which requires the accretion rate to be less than about one per cent of the eddington rate .",
    "this in turn implies that the central black holes are ultra - massive , well exceeding @xmath146 ( hlavacek - larrondo et al 2011 ) .",
    "since the bondi accretion rate @xmath147 scales as the bh mass squared , such high masses may make bondi accretion feasible in even the most luminous objects .",
    "@xmath147 also scales inversely as the temperature of the gas at the bondi radius to the power 2.5 ( for a given pressure ) , so some lower temperature gas ( e.g. at 0.5kev ) associated with a weak cooling flow below 1  kev can boost the rate further .    as well as a1835 mentioned earlier , both rxcj1504.1 - 0248 ( ogrean et al 2010 ) and macs1931.8 - 2634 ( ehlert et al 2011 )",
    "have @xmath148 of star formation , as deduced from the copious excess blue light seen .",
    "the behaviour of feedback in these luminous clusters appears similar to that in more typical clusters which are one or two orders of magnitude less luminous , meaning that the processes involved are robust . without any feedback , radiative cooling would lead to mass cooling rates of thousands of @xmath95 in these objects .",
    "dropping in x - ray luminosity by 34 orders of magnitude from the most luminous clusters are elliptical - dominated groups of galaxies and about an order of magnitude lower are individual elliptical galaxies .",
    "feedback can be seen operating in many of them .",
    "most x - ray luminous groups have cool cores with short central radiative cooling times ( @xmath149  gyr ) and low central entropy ( rasmussen & ponman 2009 ; sun et al 2009 ) .",
    "a full range of bubbling behaviour is seen in these objects ( see e.g. fig .  4 ) .",
    "nulsen ( 2007 , 2009 ) study a sample of 104 elliptical galaxies with diffuse x - ray emission and find cavities in 24 .",
    "most of the objects with cavities appear to have a heat input well in excess of their cooling luminosity ( fig .",
    "the authors suggest that the duty cycle of bubbling is then low , at around 25 per cent , which is a sharp drop from the situation in clusters and groups . at face value",
    "this indicates that the duty cycle of bubbling drops with luminosity below the high value ( @xmath150% ) in groups and clusters .",
    "bubble merging , if it occurs , could explain the higher power inferred from this sample , but does not explain why no bubbling is detected at all in some objects , although some of the selection effects mentioned below may be relevant .",
    "diehl & statler ( 2008 ) , in a study of chandra x - ray data of 54 elliptical galaxies , report that the gas is almost always assymmetrically disturbed and that this correlates with x - ray and radio measures of agn activity .",
    "more work is needed to explore all that is happening here and to firmly decide whether the activity scales simply with host mass and luminosity , or not .",
    "several selection effects become important for the detection of low power bubble activity in lower mass galaxies , including : a ) bubble size : small bubbles will be hard to resolve , even using the sub - arcsecond resolution of chandra , b ) low x - ray surface brightness : this can range from many tens of counts per pixel in a long observation of a bright cluster to just a few counts per pixel in a typical observation of an elliptical galaxy , so distinguishing a 1020 percent drop over a small number of pixels is difficult , c ) low mass x - ray binaries produce a mess of point sources in elliptical galaxies which need to be removed in order to distinguish the hot gas emission and d ) the gas temperature will be lower in lower mass objects , shifting the bulk of the emission from hot gas to below the chandra window ( effectively 0.57  kev ) .",
    "finally , the increasing onset of line radiation makes the cooling function rise steeply from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , making it difficult to stably heat and maintain a static atmosphere below @xmath136 .    as an example , consider the elliptical galaxy , ngc720 , for which the temperature , gas mass and cooling time profiles are shown in fig .  2 ( from humphrey et al 2010 ) .",
    "it shows no clear central activity beyond a weak radio source .",
    "bubble size scales roughly as @xmath153 and should be approximately 200  pc in radius ( @xmath154  arcsec ) for ngc720 .",
    "the current chandra data on this galaxy , which is of low surface brightness , can not constrain the presence of any bubbles of that size .",
    "kinetic agn feedback may operate in any object with a hot extended corona . whether there is a lower cutoff in galaxy mass to such",
    "a corona is not yet clear .",
    "mulchaey & jeltema ( 2010 ) find that elliptical field galaxies with infrared luminosity @xmath155 are mostly devoid of hot gas .",
    "most extended soft x - ray emission seen from lower mass galaxies and spiral galaxies has been attributed to a galactic fountain or outflow .",
    "anderson & bregman ( 2011 ) state that `` no hot halo has been detected around a disk galaxy out to a radius of more than a few kpc '' before reporting the detection of 40  kpc extended emission , interpreted as a hot halo , around the massive spiral galaxy ngc1961 .",
    "mass could be the important criterion here .",
    "recent detailed work using hubble space telescope surface photometry ( kormendy et al 2009 ) and integral - field spectroscopy ( sauron ; davies 2011 and references therein ) is changing our picture of the internal structure of elliptical galaxies .",
    "x - ray emitting gas is common in the massive , slowly rotating ellipticals with inner cores .",
    "agn feedback acting in maintenance mode keeps much of the hot gas from cooling ( kormendy et al 2009 ) .",
    "the situation for the less massive , normal ellipticals , which show excess light in the core and are rotating and disky , is less clear , as is the origin of the structural differences . the above selection effects may be relevant here .",
    "many elliptical galaxies orbit in the cores of groups and clusters of galaxies where extensive gaseous haloes have been ram - pressure stripped away .",
    "these objects do have weak central x - ray nuclei with ( @xmath156 ( santra et al 2007 , gallo et al 2009 ) .",
    "an interesting subset of these possess a minicorona , which is a sharp - edged puddle of gas at the galaxy s virial temperature ( @xmath157 ) with a radius of 13  kpc ( vikhlinin et al 2001 ; sun et al 2007 ; santra et al 2007 ) .",
    "the minicorona gas probably originates as stellar mass loss .",
    "the bondi accretion radius is resolved in chandra x - ray images of some of the nearest objects , such as m87 ( di matteo et al 2003 ) , enabling the temperature and density profiles to be estimated and thus the accretion rate determined .",
    "for other nearby elliptical galaxies the density and temperature profiles can be extrapolated inward from measurements made in the inner kpc .",
    "allen et al ( 2006 ) have studied a sample in which the kinetic power can be estimated from bubbles and compare this with the bondi accretion rate .",
    "a correlation emerges indicating that a few per cent of the rest mass energy of the accretion flow is released as mechanical energy in the jets .",
    "luminosity functions of the power radiated by quasars and agn in general can be readily made from careful observations of large samples of objects .",
    "less straightforward is to compile a kinetic luminosity function .",
    "it has been done however by merloni & heinz ( 2008 ) , cattaneo & best ( 2009 ) and mocz et al ( 2012 ) . the accretion history is inferred from the radiant luminosity functions , and some assumption is made connecting that to the kinetic power history .",
    "the mass function of black holes provides an integrated check on accreted mass .    to relate the kinetic and radiated power",
    ", a typical scheme might be to assume that above about one per cent of eddington luminosity the accretion flow is mainly radiatively efficient , with a probability ( say 10 per cent ) that jets are also present .",
    "below that luminosity the flow is advection dominated so the radiated power drops as the square of the accretion rate , with the bulk being kinetic power carried by jets .",
    "the net result of these calculations is that about half a per cent of the accretion power emerges as kinetic energy .",
    "early predictions for the relation between the x - ray luminosity and temperature of intracluster gas indicated @xmath158 , based on gas falling into dark matter potential wells of different total masses ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "this is the pure gravity prediction .",
    "observations show otherwise with a relation closer to @xmath159 for clusters with temperatures in the range of 3.510  kev ( markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "it may flatten toward the gravity prediction at higher temperatures .",
    "below about 2  kev there appears to be a large spread in the luminosity at a given temperature .",
    "some extra energy is required .",
    "the most likely source of the energy to heat groups is agn ( wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 , valageas & silk 1999 ; maccarthy et al 2011 ) . a significant fraction of the total power from all the black holes within a cluster or group is required here , not just that from the central galaxy .",
    "the gas fraction ( baryon mass vs total mass ) rises outward in clusters and approaches the cosmic value toward the virial radius ( e.g. vikhlinin et al 2006 ; allen et al 2008 ) .",
    "lower temperature clusters and groups have lower gas fractions in the core which indicates significant energy injection .",
    "( gonzalez et al ( 2007 ) find an increasing stellar fraction with decreasing group / cluster mass , peaking below @xmath160 where stellar and gas masses are equal .",
    "the trend is confirmed by later studies ( e.g. giodini et al 2009 ) but with a reduced stellar contribution ( see balogh et al 2008 for theoretical limits on the stellar contribution ) . )",
    "they also approach the cosmic value at the virial radius ( humphrey et al 2012 ) .",
    "putting energy into intracluster or intragroup gas causes the gas to expand , reducing its density by a much larger factor than the temperature rises and thus _ reduces _ its x - ray luminosity .",
    "just how much energy has been injected depends upon when it happened .",
    "if the injection was after the group or cluster was formed , then about 13  kev per nucleon is required ( wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 , lapi et al 2005 ) , which clearly will have a major impact on low temperature clusters and groups .",
    "less is required if it was injected early into gas which later fell into the cluster , since raising the adiabat ( increasing the entropy ) means that the gas is more difficult to compress .",
    "these possibilities can be discriminated against by comparing the gas mass fraction at a fiducial radius ( e.g. @xmath161 , vikhlinin et al 2006 ; dai et al 2010 ) as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "young et al ( 2011 ) find from this approach that continual feedback is preferable to pre - heating .",
    "powerful radio galaxies were relatively common at high redshifts above @xmath142 ( miley & de breuck 2008 ) .",
    "these fanaroff - riley class ii objects have lobes which extend many 100s kpc from the active nucleus and , due to extensive losses ( synchrotron cooling , adiabatic expansion and inverse compton scattering on the cosmic microwave background , cmb ) are only readily observed in the radio band when they are young ( blundell & rawlings 1999 ) .",
    "the lobe energies estimated from radio and x - ray ( erlund et al 06 ) observations are high , ranging from @xmath162 with a large uncertainty in the energy stored in protons , which should increase the total energy . given that the thermal energy content of the gas in a small group of total mass @xmath163 is about @xmath164 , ( @xmath165 ) it is clear that such giant radio galaxies can play an important role in the evolution of intragroup gas .",
    "it is possible that most massive galaxies have at least one outburst of jet activity , lasting @xmath166 , leading to a giant radio source in their lifetime , probably between @xmath167 in the quasar era .",
    "estimates of the volume permeated by both `` live '' and `` dead '' radio lobes at that time can be several to tens of per cent ( gopal - krishna & wiita 2001 ; mocz , fabian & blundell 2011 ) of the volume occupied by galaxy - forming filaments ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) , depending on the jet lifetime . given that they occur around the most massive galaxies which occur in proto - groups and clusters , such radio lobes should have a significant destructive and heating effect on the gas content .",
    "ms0735.6 + 7421 may be a lower redshift example of a powerful radio galaxy .",
    "observations of distant examples are hindered in the radio by steep compton losses from cmb which scale as @xmath168 , thus rendering the observed radio lifetime short .",
    "a simple picture emerges in which a massive black hole in a galaxy turns into an eddington - limited quasar , blows away the surrounding gas , truncating both further star formation in that galaxy and quasar activity .",
    "it may even involve a giant radio outburst .",
    "the galaxy dies and any later infalling or cooling gas is heated by jetted , maintenance - mode feedback ( e.g. churazov et al 2005 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the black hole resembles that of outbursts in galactic black hole binaries ( bhb ) .",
    "these objects consist of a stellar mass black hole ( @xmath169 ) in close orbit about a normal star .",
    "accretion instabilities cause the accretion rate to increase to the eddington rate then drop by several orders of magnitude .",
    "although they are not important sources of feedback in a galaxy , some bhb do blow bubbles ( e.g. gallo et al 2005 ) .",
    "outbursts follow a common pattern ( fender & belloni 2004 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) ; the source beginning in the weak radio - emitting low state , rising in luminosity in all bands towards the eddington limit where its spectrum softens and the radio emission peaks with a strong outburst .",
    "radio emission then ceases until the luminosity drops and the spectrum hardens into the low state again . as the source goes into a quiescent state the flow becomes advection",
    "dominated .",
    "much of black hole accretion including timescales and luminosities scale with mass .",
    "the radio emission scales in a more complex manner along a fundamental plane ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ) , but the general pattern may remain for agn .",
    "the timescales are far too long for us to watch an outburst and their behaviour must be pieced together from the populations we observe .",
    "there are some plausible connections however , with the luminous outbursts correlating with powerful frii sources and the weaker low state with fri sources .",
    "a further property of bhb which may prove important is that winds and jets appear to anticorrelate ( miller et al 2008 ; neilsen & lee 2009 ; king et al 2012 ; ponti et al 2012 ) .",
    "winds occur at high eddington fractions when jets are not observed , and vice versa at low eddington values .",
    "atomic processes do not scale for accretion flows , so ionization - dependent accretion instabilities may not be relevant in quasars , and outbursts may be triggered instead by mergers .",
    "clear evidence for this has yet to be established .",
    "submillimetre galaxies at high redshifts often show evidence for strong disturbances which could be mergers , as do some nearby low - luminosity agn ( sec .",
    "2.5 ) , but most agn at intermediate redshifts show no more evidence for merging than do control non - active galaxies .",
    "there are many uncertainties in the evolution of agn , apart from the role of mergers .",
    "does a massive galaxy undergo a single quasar phase or several ?",
    "is the observed luminous phase preceded by a compton thick phase ?",
    "how representative are observations of low redshift agn to conditions around powerful quasars at @xmath50",
    "? how much do jets depend on the spin of the black hole and how does the spin evolve ? is a cluster cool core shaped by a powerful outburst early on and maintained thereafter by black hole spin , which is kept `` topped up '' by sporadic accretion ?",
    "contributions to understanding agn feedback can be expected from all wavebands , but there are some clear advances which can be anticipated from instruments and telescopes being built or planned for the next few years . in particular , the jaxa / nasa / esa x - ray observatory astro - h ( takahashi et al 2010 ) , to be launched in 2014 , will offer non - dispersive high spectral resolution x - ray spectroscopy on a spatial scale of 1.5 arcmin using a microcalorimeter .",
    "it will reveal the number and nature of outflows in quasars and other agn through absorption spectroscopy , being sensitive to all ionizations stages of iron , for example .",
    "it will also , for the first time , map velocity flows of hot gas in galactic outflows , and the hot atmospheres in elliptical galaxies , groups and clusters .",
    "since much of the energy feedback in those objects is mechanical and though the motion of gas , this will take our understanding to the next level of detail .",
    "sensitive , low - frequency radio observations at good spatial resolution , as expected from lofar and other planned radio telescopes leading to the ska ( square kilometre array ) will reveal the old electron populations in the bubbles of cluster cores and giant radio galaxies .",
    "maps of the low - frequency radio sky at redshift 2 should reveal just how much and where feedback from powerful frii sources has occurred .    at ghz frequencies",
    "the jansky very large array ( jvla ) will map the interactions of jets with surrounding plasma , and reveal the magnetic field structure of the plasma through much more detailed faraday rotation observations .",
    "redshifted to @xmath170 .",
    "the line and continuum sensitivity for the jvla in 12 hr and the line sensitivity for alma and existing submm interferometers are shown ( adapted from carilli et al 2011 ) .",
    "noema is an ongoing expansion of the iram plateau de bure interferometer by a factor of two in collecting area .",
    "sma is the submillimeter array in hawaii .",
    ", width=336 ]    the role of radiative feedback needs high spatial and spectral resolution observations at wavelengths that can penetrate the inevitable high absorption present .",
    "alma ( the atacama large millimetre / submillimetre array ) will be a leader in detecting and resolving molecular and dust components and their motions . for high redshift objects where feedback may be a dominant process , a combination of the the jvla , which will measure the radio continuum to distinguish agn and star formation , low order co transitions to give total molecular gas mass , dynamics and low order dense gas tracers ( hcn , hco@xmath138 ) to probe dense star cores , and alma , which will obtain the excitation from high order co , the dust continuum and star formation and fine structure lines to give the cooling rates , further distinguish agn and star formation and measure dynamics , will be crucial ( fig .  10 : carilli et al 2011 ) .",
    "the james webb space telescope will observe the rich , rest - frame , optical band in distant objects , enabling many powerful diagnostics to be used .",
    "agn feedback will be an important goal for the next generation ground - based optical and near infrared telescopes .",
    "both large - area surveys ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey , first- faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ) and single - object studies ( e.g. mrk231 , apm08279 + 5255 , the perseus cluster , m87 etc . ) will continue to be essential .",
    "very significant advances in our observational understanding of agn feedback can be confidently expected in the present decade .",
    "an active nucleus interacts with the gas in its host galaxy through radiation pressure , winds and jets .",
    "the consequences can be profound for the final mass of the stellar component of the galaxy as well as for the black hole .",
    "there is clearly enough energy and momentum produced by the agn to expel the interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "how , when and if it does so are the important questions .",
    "it appears that the radiative or wind mode was most active when the agn was a young quasar . at that stage",
    "the galaxy had a large component of cold molecular gas and the nucleus was probably highly obscured .",
    "obscuration has meant that direct observational evidence is often circumstantial , relying on nearby analogues .",
    "progress has been difficult and slow , but is expected to accelerate soon following observations with alma , jvla and other telescopes .    the kinetic mode on the other hand is more easily observed , albeit at x - ray and radio wavelengths , since it is acting now in nearby massive objects .",
    "the surrounding gas is hot , highly ionized and mostly transparent .",
    "although the gross energetics are roughly understood , the details are not . bubbling of jetted energy from the central black hole appears to scale well over 3 to 4 orders of magnitude in luminosity from the most luminous clusters to small groups .",
    "the behaviour in individual elliptical galaxies and bulges is uncertain , partly because it is more difficult to detect .",
    "non - radiative cooling of hot gas by mixing with cold gas may be an important link in the process .",
    "an attractive possibility is that the radiative mode shaped the overall galaxy and black hole mass at early times and the kinetic mode has since maintained that situation where needed ( churazov et al 2005 ) .",
    "powerful giant radio outbursts back at @xmath167 in all massive galaxies may have been common , heating and shaping the gas not only in the host galaxy but in the host groups and protoclusters .",
    "observational evidence is growing that the baryonic part of the low redshift universe has been shaped by the energy and momentum output of black holes , through agn feedback .",
    "this has profound implications for our understanding of galaxy , group and cluster evolution and has ramifications for precision cosmology using galaxies ( van daalen et al 2011 ) .",
    "agn feedback appears to be an important aspect in the complexity of the baryonic universe .",

    "<S> radiation , winds and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium leading to ejection or heating of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> this can terminate star formation in the galaxy and stifle accretion onto the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> such active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between central black hole and host galaxy mass . </S>",
    "<S> direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback , which occurs when the agn is very luminous , has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects . </S>",
    "<S> feedback from the kinetic or radio mode , which uses the mechanical energy of radio - emitting jets often seen when the agn is operating at a lower level , is common in massive elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is well observed directly through x - ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium . the energy flow , which is roughly continuous , heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> feedback appears to maintain a long - lived heating / cooling balance . </S>",
    "<S> powerful , jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback which affect the cores of groups and subclusters . </S>",
    "<S> new telescopes and instruments from the radio to x - ray bands will come into operation over the next few years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of agn feedback .    </S>",
