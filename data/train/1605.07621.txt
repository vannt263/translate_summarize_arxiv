    "the idea of using galaxy clusters as nature s telescopes goes at least as far back as the 1990 s @xcite .",
    "since then , numerous works have utilized the magnifying power of clusters to better resolve high redshift galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "following in the footsteps of clash ( cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ; pi : m. postman ) , hubble frontier fields survey ( hff ; pi : j. lotz ) is an ambitious effort to use massive merging clusters at intermediate redshifts as nature s most powerful telescopes",
    ". launched in 2013 , it is a three year project that devotes 840 orbits of director s discretionary time to do deep imaging of six galaxy clusters plus the accompanying parallel fields . each field",
    "is observed in three hst optical bands and four ir bands .",
    "it is the largest commitment to date of hst resources to the exploration of the distant universe through the power of gravitational lensing .",
    "the hff project has been remarkably prolific , with contributions in the structure of galaxy clusters @xcite , individual high redshift galaxies @xcite , and high redshift galaxy luminosity function and its evolution @xcite .    to utilize clusters as telescopes one needs to first characterize their uneven optics , i.e. obtain cluster magnification maps .",
    "these are derived from the mass distribution maps , which are , therefore , of prime importance to the success of the project .",
    "even with hst s deep imaging of the frontier fields , the number of detected strongly lensed sources is not sufficient to map out a cluster s mass distribution with arbitrarily high precision and resolution . a finite observational data set leaves information gaps .",
    "how to fill these gaps has been the subject of many papers , based on several lens mass inversion methods .",
    "the assumptions going into the different methods are varied ( see section  [ mim ] ) ; for example , some methods rely on the observed light distribution of cluster galaxies to model the mass of the galaxies and estimate the mass distribution of the cluster , while others do not use cluster galaxies at all .",
    "each method generates statistical uncertainties on the recovered mass maps . a practical estimate of the systematic uncertainties is provided by the dispersion between different models .",
    "this is the strategy implicitly adopted by hff .",
    "originally , stsci sponsored five modeling groups with a diverse range of models .",
    "these groups have since been joined by others , leading to an even wider range of available models .",
    "in addition to the hff data products and the published work based on these by various groups , added value of the hff project comes from two new features that are being adopted for the first time in the cluster lensing community .    _",
    "( 1 ) consistency and uniformity_.   in the past , comparison of various science results from cluster lensing was hindered by the use of different data sets , and differences between model versions from the same groups .",
    "most of that has been eliminated in the hff project , because teams collectively agree on the most trustworthy set of data to use , namely multiple images , redshifts and weak lensing measurements .",
    "_ ( 2 ) testing against known mass distributions_.   testing of the modeling techniques against synthetic clusters is very important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods .",
    "the synthetic cluster comparison project from @xcite is the largest coordinated effort to date to compare cluster lensing inversion methods based on known mass distributions .    in this paper",
    "we add a third item to the list : analyses to assess the similarities and differences of the lens inversion methods , without the use of synthetic mass distributions .",
    "we hope it will help provide a unified and transparent view of the lens inversion results .",
    "_ ( 3 ) comparison of models for unknown mass distributions .",
    "_   an exercise parallel to _ ( 2 ) _ is to compare reconstructions of an unknown mass distribution , i.e. those of observed galaxy clusters , among themselves .",
    "this will show which methods are similar to each other , and which are outliers , and assess which methods are better at estimating systematic uncertainties in the reconstructions , assuming the true uncertainties are given by the scatter among models .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because factors other than modeling methods are approximately the same among all the reconstructions .",
    "the positions and redshifts of images are the same in all reconstructions , as these were agreed upon by all participating groups .",
    "though the set of sources / images used by various groups are not the same , the number of sources / images used are comparable , see table  [ sldata ] .",
    "the quality of the mass reconstructions , as summarized by the lens plane rms ( the rms of the differences between the observed and reconstructed image positions ) is also similar in all models , and is @xmath4 for most models ( see table  [ sldata ] ) .",
    "this type of comparison can also provide an indirect test of the state of the art of synthetic models themselves . if the synthetic clusters are well matched to observed hff clusters in important respects , then a comparison of reconstructions of observed clusters and that of synthetic clusters should yield statistically similar results .",
    "our current work was inspired by a limited comparison of models presented in @xcite , which was based on a supernova type ia , hff14tom ( sn  tomas ) , that went off in 2014 behind abell 2744 , one of the hff clusters . as standard candles ,",
    "type ia supernovae are important because they are the only sources whose actual magnification can be accurately measured , and used to constrain lens inversions  @xcite .",
    "based on its redshift and light curve properties , @xcite deduced that the source was magnified by @xmath5 relative to its expected unmagnified brightness .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured magnification includes both the photometric uncertainty and the known scatter in the luminosity of type ia sne at that redshift ( after correcting for light curve shape and color ) .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , taken from that paper , shows the magnification predictions of various lens models for the location and redshift of hff14tom , with 68% uncertainties .",
    "the figure also shows that the median of the lensing model magnification predictions is 25% higher than what is deduced from the observed brightness of the supernova .",
    "hff14tom is not the first supernova to be detected behind galaxy clusters @xcite , but it is the first to be used systematically as a precise benchmark to compare several models .",
    "later in 2014 , the universe provided another opportunity for directly testing lens models with the appearance of the first multiply imaged sn behind the hff cluster macs j1149 : sn refsdal  @xcite .",
    "this sn was strongly lensed both by the cluster and also by a single cluster member galaxy , resulting in four distinct images in an `` einstein cross '' configuration .",
    "measurement of the time delays and relative magnifications between these first four images allowed a similar test of lens model accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the reappearance of sn refsdal with a fifth image more widely spaced from the initial four is now offering another opportunity to confront lens model predictions with a pencil - beam test  @xcite .",
    "although these sn tests have been exciting and informative for the lens modeling community , we still have only a handful of examples , scattered across several clusters .",
    "hst remains the only observatory that has demonstrated the capability to discover and study these distant sne in sufficient detail to enable such tests . for the foreseeable future such spot checks will remain few and far between .",
    "in this paper we extend the model comparison analysis of @xcite to the whole area of clusters , and especially to regions of high magnification .",
    "we also augment the analysis with a range of different statistics . because the true magnification ( the equivalent of the vertical solid line and blue band in fig .  [ fig : figure1 ] ) as a function of sky location is unknown ,",
    "we use the median of all models as the comparison benchmark ( the equivalent of the vertical dashed line . )",
    "we examine all the reconstruction models that used hff data and were submitted to stsci in september 2015 in response to that call for models .",
    "models v3 and v3.1 of clusters",
    "abell 2744 ( @xmath6 ) and macs j0416 ( @xmath7 ) fall into that category .",
    ".summary of input strong lensing data : number of images used by each model , the assumed positional error of the images , and the lens plane rms of the reconstructed maps .",
    "the values on either side of the vertical bar are for abell 2744 and macs j0416 , respectively .",
    "all models are v3 unless otherwise noted .",
    "( note that in some models , like glafic , the value of the assumed positional error affects the reconstructions , but in many others , like sharon / johnson and diego , it does not , because the same positional error is assumed for all the images .",
    "the assumed positional error may affect the quoted errors in mass reconstructions . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the comparison of models presented here provides a birds - eye view of the state of the art of cluster lensing reconstruction .",
    "we show that despite the overall agreement among models , the differences are not insignificant , and often exceed the statistical errors of individual reconstructions .",
    "we have argued that the most important source for the differences in predicted magnifications are lensing degeneracies . while the classic global mass sheet degeneracy is broken by sources at multiple redshifts , the generalized version of that degeneracy ( where the scaling of the mass and the added mass sheet vary somewhat across the face of the cluster ) , as well as other , local degeneracies are alive and well .",
    "a corollary is that a small lens plane rms is not a sufficient condition for the model to be a good representation of the true magnification distribution of the cluster . despite degeneracies ,",
    "the total cluster mass is likely to be well constrained by all models .",
    "degeneracies redistribute mass within the lens , but have little affect on the total mass , which is an integral quantity , largely determined by the radial extent of the lensed images from the cluster centre .",
    "model comparison of the type presented here can be used to determine how well the data constrains the mass and magnification map of a cluster : if there is a significant dispersion between models predictions , then a cluster is not well constrained , despite what the statistical uncertainties from individual models may imply . in the present case , macs j0416 is constrained considerably better than abell 2744 , whose models suffer from the generalized mass sheet degeneracy , and possibly from the source - plane transformation ( section  [ degen ] ) .",
    "the reason why the msd is not an issue in macs j0416 , but is present among models of abell 2744 is not clear .",
    "one possibility is that macs j0416 has more multiple images , thereby restricting the msd .",
    "quality of lensing data , like accurate redshifts , may play a role , however , msd - degenerate models of clusters with perfectly known data are easy to construct @xcite .",
    "we show that the same set of models ( for example , the 7 models that are in common between abell 2744 and macs j0416 ) can perform differently in two clusters . for example , in one cluster , a given model may consistently over - predict the magnifications , while in another , its predictions could track the median very well .",
    "this conclusion has implications for model testing on simulated data . even if a given model performs well in tests where a synthetic cluster is being reconstructed",
    ", one must be careful in claiming that method to be superior to others : the method may work well on clusters generated using certain prescriptions , but not necessarily on real ones , whose physics may differ from that assumed in simulations .",
    "this makes the analysis presented in this paper , which does not rely on synthetic clusters , an essential part of model comparison .    for the v3 and v3.1 round of hff reconstructions , the number of submitted parametric models far outnumbered free - form ones : williams/",
    "is fully free - form , and diego is hybrid .",
    "the rest are parametric , and 3 ( cats v3 , v3.1 , and sharon / johnson ) use the same modeling software , . because of that , we can not currently assess the differences in the performance of the two types of reconstructions : parametric vs. free - form , but hope to do so in the future , when more models become available .",
    "another interesting avenue is to explore the differences between v1 and v3 models .",
    "preliminary examination suggests that v1 models of abell 2744 were in better agreement with each other than is the case with v3 models .",
    "in this study we represented the actual magnifications  which are unknown  with the median values from all models . while there is no guarantee that the median is the true magnification , it is the best guess . in the future",
    "it will be interesting to repeat this analysis with synthetic clusters instead of observed ones .",
    "this will provide information both about how well a single model s magnifications match the true ones , as well as how well the median of all models , @xmath8 , tracks this true magnification .",
    "the remark made earlier stays relevant of course : while it is certainly a good idea to benchmark different models against simulated clusters , one must avoid the pitfall of declaring one model to be superior simply because it performs the best on simulated data .",
