    "there has been a growing interest in the multi - electron dynamics when atoms or molecules interact with intense laser field , due to the development of laser technology.@xcite as is well known , the computational task grows in exponential way as the degrees of freedom for the system increase . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "theoretical physicists have paid much attention to the time - dependent hartree - fock(tdhf ) method @xcite recently , since it has the promise for simulating electron dynamics of extended systems and takes account of the response of all electrons in the strong laser field . in general tdhf scheme ,",
    "the time - dependent wave functions are expanded in terms of a complete set of time - independent hartree - fock orbitals . to achieve meaningful predication from tdhf , both high - quality bound and continuum hartree - fock orbitals are needed .",
    "so it s necessary to perform accurate hartree - fock calculations for atoms and molecules .",
    "there are a number of approaches to study electronic properties of diatomic molecules within hartree - fock approximation for various applications .",
    "roothaan describes molecular orbitals with a linear combination of atomic orbitals(lcao ) , and obtains the molecular orbitals and orbital energies by linear variational method.@xcite however , the atomic orbitals are usually expanded by slater - type or gaussian - type functions , which suffer from linear dependence , and the basis parameters need to be chosen carefully .",
    "after that , many kinds of numerical hartree - fock methods arise .",
    "partial - wave self - consistent - field method is developed to decrease the total energies of n@xmath0 and co by more than @xmath1 a.u .",
    "than those obtained by lcao methods.@xcite meanwhile , finite element method and finite difference method are applied to diatomic molecule calculations , and good accuracy is achieved.@xcite compared to the traditional lcao method , finite difference method is more accurate because of basis independence .",
    "another approach for accurate hartree - fock calculation of diatomic molecules adopts b - splines and associated legendre polynomials , and the second - order correlation effect is calculated by perturbation theory.@xcite recently , the hartree - fock calculations for diatomic molecules have been carried out by hermite spline associating with collocation method.@xcite however , the above - mentioned numerical methods are carried out in spheroidal coordinates , which it is not easy to include nuclear motion or extend to study the electronic properties for multinuclear linear molecules.@xcite    one - center method and b - spline basis have been widely used to investigate diatomic molecular structures.@xcite the main advantages of one - center method are that the calculation of diatomic molecule is similar to atomic calculation , and it is natural to take account of nuclear motion and investigate the electronic properties of multinuclear linear molecules.@xcite @xmath2 a.u .",
    "accuracy has been reached for the lowest state of h@xmath3 by one - center method , in conjunction with the properties of b - spline.@xcite the accuracy of @xmath4 a.u . has been yielded for the ground state of h@xmath5 , which is based on infinite angular expansions and one - center approach.@xcite resonant photoionization of h@xmath0 has been investigated by one - center scheme and b - spline functions,@xcite since the continuum states are well represented .",
    "bian et al . have employed one - center method and b - spline basis to study ionization dynamics of the one - electron systems h@xmath3 and h@xmath6 in intense laser field.@xcite recently , one - center method has been combined with b - spline functions to study hydrogen molecular ion in strong magnetic field , which could rival multi - center calculations.@xcite    the purpose of this work is to extend one - center method and b - spline basis to investigate the structure of many - electron atoms and molecules at hartree - fock level , and lay the foundation for the development of tdhf . to our knowledge , this is the first attempt to expand radial wave function and angular wave function by b - spline functions in the molecular hartree - fock calculations within the framework of one - center method .",
    "the advantages are twofold .",
    "first , the evaluation of two - electron integrals is time - consuming in hartree - fock theory , while b - splines are local basis functions,@xcite so it could save much time to calculate two - electron integrals .",
    "the second one is that radial b - splines could handle cusps by adopting coincident knots at the nuclear positions,@xcite and angular b - splines could speed up convergence than spherical harmonic functions.@xcite    the organization of the present paper is as follows .",
    "firstly , the hartree - fock formulas associating one - center method with b - spline basis and single - active - electron(sae ) model are briefly described in section ii ; secondly , the results and discussions of some typical atoms and diatomic molecules are shown in section iii ; finally , our conclusions and outlooks are presented in section iv .",
    "positioning the origin of the spherical coordinates at middle point between the two nuclei , within the born - oppenheimer approximation , the total hamiltonian of closed - shell diatomic molecule with 2n electrons could be written as follow(atomic units are employed throughout this article . ) :    @xmath7+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\neq j}\\frac{1}{r_{ij}}+\\frac{z_az_b}{r}.\\ ] ]     coordinates of the diatomic molecule . ]",
    "the first term includes the electron kinetic energies and the coulomb potentials between the electron and the nuclei .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the charges of the two nuclei , and r is the internuclear distance .",
    "@xmath10 is the repulsion potential between electrons .",
    "the third term is constant , which indicates the interaction between the two nuclei .",
    "the coordinates of diatomic molecules are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the spatial molecular orbital @xmath11 could be expanded by basis functions @xmath12 :    @xmath13    the total energy of the system is given by:@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 indicates the electron - electron coulomb interaction and @xmath16 denotes the electron - electron exchange interaction .",

    "@xmath48 is the molecular orbital which we obtain from hartree - fock calculations for diatomic molecule .",
    "as above , we solve eq.(14 ) and obtain a series of eigenvalues , in which negative eigenvalues and positive eigenvalues correspond to bound states and discretized continuum states , respectively .",
    "the laser field is linear polarized along the molecular axis , and the time - dependent electric field is defined via the vector potential a(t ) as e(t)=-@xmath49a(t ) .",
    "the time - dependent wave function could be expressed with the field - free eigenstates as follow : @xmath50    the time - dependent schrdinger equations for the highest occupied molecular orbital(homo ) of diatomic molecule in intense laser field are written as : @xmath51\\phi(\\textbf{r},t).\\ ] ]    substituting eq.(17 ) into eq.(18 ) and projecting onto @xmath52 , we adopt crank - nicolsen method to propagate the time - dependent wave function.@xcite after we obtain the time - dependent wave function , the ionization probability at the end of the laser pulse is defined as :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 denotes the time at the end of the laser pulse .      considering the axial symmetry of diatomic molecules , both the radial functions and the angular functions are expressed with b - splines in the following way : @xmath55    @xmath56(r ) and @xmath57 are the b - splines of order k@xmath58 and k@xmath59 , respectively .",
    "there are many advantages for b - spline.@xcite on one hand , finite b - splines could construct a nearly complete set , and do not suffer from linear dependence . on the other hand , b - splines could provide a very proper representation of bound state wave function and continuum state wave function,@xcite and the density of continuum states could be adjusted by changing the truncated radius , which has been applied to studying dynamic properties of molecules such as photoelectron energy spectra and enhanced ionization.@xcite the factor @xmath60 describes the asymptotic behavior of wave function for @xmath61 close to @xmath62 , and also eliminates the singularities in eq.(5 ) for @xmath63 . for radial b - splines ,",
    "k@xmath58 - 2 multiple knots are positioned at nuclear locations to handle the cusps properly in radial direction , which has been tested in ref.[32 ] .",
    "the other knots are distributed in exponential way , so we could obtain satisfactory results for the bound states . for radial b - splines ,",
    "the knots are distributed in the following way : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total radial knot number and r@xmath66 is the truncated radius . except for the knots locating at the nuclear position and on the boundaries ,",
    "the other knots are distributed as follows : @xmath67    the parameter @xmath68 could be adjusted .",
    "the angular wave function is expanded by b - splines , since b - splines include more high angular momentum effects and accelerate angular convergence dramatically.@xcite for angular b - splines , the knots sequence are written as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total number of angular knots . for atoms and homonuclear molecules , the knots in ( -1,0 )",
    "are distributed in the following way : @xmath71,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the number of knots in ( -1,0 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 is adjusted to let more knots position close to @xmath62 to cope with cusps in angular direction , and the knots in [ 0,1 ] are in symmetric distribution comparing with the knots in [ -1,0 ] .    for heteronuclear molecules ,",

    "the nucleus with more charge is positioned at -1 in the angular direction , so more knots are distributed in ( -1,0 ) comparing with the range ( 0,1 ) .",
    "however , the knots are distributed as gauss - legender - quadrature - points in ref.[30,31 ] , so the b - spline knots can not be flexibly adjusted .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results of some atoms , homonuclear molecules(h@xmath80 and n@xmath80 ) and heteronuclear molecules(lih and co ) . we choose h@xmath80 and lih , because the electronic properties have been studied in many different ways and the results",
    "could be severed as benchmarks to check our approaches.@xcite we select n@xmath80 and co , since they have been widely studied in experiments to investigate ionization,@xcite and we will extend the present approach to study the ionization dynamics for n@xmath80 and co in intense laser fields .    for diatomic molecules , the orders of both the radial b - spline and the angular b - spline are k@xmath81(@xmath82)=9 ;",
    "for atoms , the order of the radial b - spline is k@xmath81=7 and the order of the angular b - spline is k@xmath83=3 . @xmath84 and @xmath85 are 300 and 30 , respectively .",

    ", since the outmost orbital is not tightly bound .",
    "the orbitals of one - electron hamiltonian h are chosen as the initial wave functions , and the orbital energies are used as convergence criterion for the hartree - fock iterations . in each iteration",
