    "the hallmark of planetary microlensing events is a short deviation from an otherwise normal , point - source / point - lens ( hereafter pspl ) event .",
    "@xcite showed that extrasolar planets could be detected from such events , and @xcite gave an explicit prescription for how the planet / star mass ratio @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and the angular separation @xmath3 ( in units of the angular einstein radius @xmath4 ) could be reconstructed by decomposing the event light curve into its `` normal '' and `` perturbed '' components .",
    "work during the ensuing decade has elucidated many additional subtleties of planetary light curves , but their fundamental characterization as briefly perturbed pspl events has remained intact .",
    "of particular importance in the present context , @xcite showed that events with small impact parameter ( @xmath5 ; where @xmath6 is the minimum separation between the source and the lens center of mass in units of @xmath4 ) probe the so - called `` central caustic '' of the lens geometry , making them much more sensitive to the presence of planets than the larger impact - parameter events analyzed by @xcite , which probe the outer `` planetary caustic '' .",
    "these central - caustic events are of exceptional importance , even though they are intrinsically rare .",
    "they are rare simply because the central - caustic is much smaller than the planetary caustic , so the great majority of planet - induced deviations ( of fixed fractional amplitude ) are due to planetary caustics .",
    "however , the probability of detecting a planet is much greater in small impact - parameter events , partly because the source is guaranteed to pass close to the central caustic , which almost by definition is near the center of the lens geometry ( @xmath7 ) and partly because even the sensitivity of planetary caustics is enhanced for @xmath5 .",
    "( here @xmath8 denotes the source position on the sky , normalized to @xmath4 , with respect to the lens center of mass . ) by contrast , higher impact - parameter events miss the central caustic , and they are likely to miss the planetary caustic as well because it lies in a random position relative to the source trajectory . because of their higher sensitivity to planets , and because they can be recognized in real time , low impact - parameter events are monitored more intensively than typical events by microlensing follow - up networks , which in turn further enhances their sensitivity to planets .",
    "central - caustic events , like their planetary - caustic cousins , involve a short deviation from an otherwise normal pspl light curve .",
    "the major difference between these two classes of planetary events is that central - caustic anomalies always occur near the peak , whereas planetary - caustic perturbations can occur anywhere on the light curve , and are typically expected on the wings of the light curve . of particular importance , for central - caustic events , there is no simple prescription for extracting @xmath3 and @xmath1 by decomposing the light curve into `` normal '' and `` perturbed '' components and it is unclear to what degree these two parameters are degenerate .",
    "another important , albeit accidental , discovery was that planets could give rise to perturbations that are not short compared to the event timescale .",
    "in the course of their search for planetary perturbations among 43 approximately pspl events , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) found one event , ogle-1999-bul-36 , that was asymmetric in a way that was consistent with the presence of a planet .",
    "they argued , however , that the asymmetry was also consistent with parallax effects induced by the earth s motion around the sun of the type analyzed by @xcite , and that in general it would be extremely difficult to distinguish between the two possible causes of such an asymmetry .",
    "they concluded that , in most cases , microlensing searches are not able to distinguish between parallax and a weak , asymmetric planetary perturbation , and consequently , all such `` detections '' should be ignored .",
    "this reduces the sensitivity of microlensing searches to planets , but only by an extremely small amount since , as @xcite showed , long - timescale asymmetric perturbations account for less than @xmath9 of all planetary events .",
    "hence , the long - timescale asymmetric events also confirm in a way the basic paradigm : planetary perturbations have short durations relative to the parent light curve , and in the rare cases for which they do not , they are not recognizable as a planetary perturbation anyway",
    ".    however , not all short timescale deviations are due to planets and therefore the mere detection of such an anomaly does not prove the presence of a planet .",
    "@xcite showed that close binaries ( @xmath10 ) give rise to light curves that are virtually identical to pspl events , except when the source comes very close to the lens center of mass ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "hence , for events with @xmath5 , the light curve looks `` normal '' except for a brief deviation near the peak .",
    "qualitatively , this is exactly the same behavior as that of central - caustic planetary events .",
    "similarly , light curves of wide - binary ( @xmath12 ) events can also take the same form if one  and only one  of the caustics lies very close to the source s passage . indeed , a close correspondence between a certain pair of close - binary and wide - binary events was discovered both theoretically @xcite and observationally @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question under what conditions these various types of events can be distinguished from one another .",
    "if central - caustic planetary events could not be distinguished from close- and/or wide - binary events , it would seriously undermine planet searches in high - magnification events and hence would call into question the basic strategy adopted by microlensing follow - up groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we analyze the light curve of the microlensing event macho  99-blg-47 , the first intensively monitored event with a short - lived , high signal - to - noise - ratio deviation from an otherwise normal pspl light curve .",
    "we identify the lens as an extreme - separation binary rather than a planetary system , thereby showing that , at least in this case , the two classes can be clearly distinguished .",
    "we also show that both wide- and close - binary solutions fit the data equally well , implying that although planetary perturbations can be distinguished from those arising from extreme - separation binaries , the discrimination between very close and very wide binaries may be difficult in practice .",
    "the initial alert for the microlensing event macho  99-blg-47  was issued by the macho collaboration on 1999 july 23.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the event was located about 18  from the galactic center along the disk ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and reported to be rather faint at baseline ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "planet began monitoring macho  99-blg-47  right after the electronic alert with the expectation that it would be a very high magnification event .",
    "planet detected anomalous behavior in the light curve during the first week of august , and subsequently issued an anomaly alert on 1999 august 4.[multiblock footnote omitted ]      the planet light curve of macho  99-blg-47  consists of observations made from three different southern sites : the elizabeth 1 m at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , sutherland , south africa ; the canopus 1 m near hobart , tasmania , australia ; and the yale / aura / lisbon / osu ( yalo ) 1 m at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , la serena , chile . the observations were carried out in two bands : @xmath17 ( at all three sites ) and @xmath18 ( at saao only ) .",
    "the event was most intensely monitored in 1999 august during and following the photometric peak and the anomaly , but we obtained data through mid - september and also when the event was close to baseline early in the 2000 season as the source came out from behind the sun . after the usual reductions , we perform photometry by two independent methods : a direct fit to the point spread function ( psf ) using dophot @xcite and difference imaging using isis @xcite . for details , see also @xcite . because of the different characteristics of the two methods and varying frame qualities , we recover a different number of photometric measurements . before any elaborate efforts to clean and select the data , we have 303 points from dophot photometry and 297 from isis photometry ( table  [ tab : data ] ) for the 1999 observations , as well as 8 points observed from yalo during early 2000 season ( dophot photometry only ) .",
    "the photometric observations taken at saao are calibrated to the standard johnson - cousins system with respect to e - region stars @xcite observed contemporaneously with macho  99-blg-47  at saao on 1999 july 31 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of observations from canopus and yalo are not calibrated explicitly , but rather we allow independent source fluxes for different sites and bands in our modeling , which provide the relative photometric scalings among them .",
    "we also include in our analysis the publicly available macho photometry , which comprises 77 @xmath19 and 90 @xmath20 points from the 1999 season as well as 213 @xmath19 and 227 @xmath20 points taken between 1995 and 1998 .",
    "the latter were used to constrain the baseline and to check for source variability .",
    "we find no evidence for such variability .",
    "the difference photometry is placed on an absolute scale by a linear regression from the psf - based flux ( dophot ) to the differential flux ( isis ) , after removing obvious faulty points from the two data sets based on the reports by each reduction / photometry package .",
    "we find that , except for the canopus data , the residuals of the psf - based flux from the regression line are strongly correlated with the size of the seeing disk , but that most of this correlation is removed by adding a linear seeing correction . for example , for the saao @xmath17-band observations , we detect the presence of a non - zero linear seeing dependence term of @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) , with the signal to noise ratio being as large as @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the net flux of the lensed source star alone and the total flux in the same psf when there is no magnification .    in order to minimize the effects of known systematics , we optimize the data set by rejecting outliers and reevaluating the sizes of the photometric error bars .",
    "we also include a correction term for the correlation between the seeing and the blended flux that enters the same psf with the lensed source when we fit the observed flux to a specific magnification model .",
    "these procedures are described in detail and fully justified in several earlier planet papers @xcite .",
    "briefly , we first construct an initial clean subset of the data by rejecting 3-@xmath26 outliers with respect to the linear regression from dophot to isis flux , and then determine a reference model based on this subset .",
    "once we have a reference model , we include all the data and follow the same iterative procedure of outlier removal and error rescaling described in @xcite .",
    "the final data set used for the subsequent analysis reported in the present paper contains 276 dophot - reduced and 266 isis - reduced planet points as well as 166 macho points ( one @xmath19 point rejected ) , all from the 1999 season ( table  [ tab : data ] ) . the data obtained during seasons other than 1999 ( the 2000 season yalo @xmath17 , and the 1995  1998 season macho @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands )",
    "are included in the analysis as a combined single point for each set . in doing so ,",
    "4 data points ( all @xmath20 in the 1998 season ) are eliminated as outliers .",
    "the light curve of macho  99-blg-47  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) is that of a normal high - magnification pspl event with a short - lived ( @xmath27 ) deviation near the peak , of the type predicted for planets @xcite or binaries with extreme separations .",
    "we therefore develop a method for probing the space of lens geometries of this type and then search for the minimum @xmath28 within this space .",
    "we begin by excising the anomalous points near the peak and fitting the remaining light curve to the degenerate form of the @xcite profile that obtains in the high - magnification limit @xcite , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the instantaneous flux , @xmath31 is the peak flux above the baseline of the model , @xmath25 is the baseline flux , @xmath32 is the time of the peak , and @xmath33 is the effective width of the light curve .",
    "these degenerate parameters are related to the standard parameters by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the einstein timescale , i.e. , the time required for the source to move an einstein radius .",
    "we find @xmath38 ( heliocentric julian date ) , @xmath39 , and that @xmath31 roughly corresponds to @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig : data ] ] ) .",
    "however , the exact values of those parameters are quite dependent on which points we excise .",
    "note that though the baseline magnitude is measured to be @xmath41 , there is at this point essentially no information of how the baseline flux divides into source flux @xmath24 and blended flux @xmath42 , which is why it is necessary to fit the light curve to the degenerate profile ( eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : degen ] ] ) .",
    "next , we reinsert the excised points near the peak and note that the maximum ( over - magnified ) deviation from the degenerate fit is @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) .",
    "we then establish a set of initial trial event geometries as follows .",
    "for each diamond - shaped caustic produced by various geometries of ( @xmath3,@xmath1 ) pairs , we examine the magnification as a function of distance from the `` caustic center '' along each of the three directions defined by the four cusps of the caustic ( one direction is redundant due to the reflection symmetry with respect to the binary axis ) . here for computational simplicity , we use an analytic proxy point for the `` caustic center , '' defined as follows . for close binaries",
    ", we adopt the center of mass of the lens system for the caustic center . on the other hand , for wide binaries , the position of one component of the binary shifted toward the other component by @xmath44^{-1}$ ]",
    "is chosen as the caustic center .",
    "[ these choices can be understood from the approximation developed in appendix  [ sec : ap ] .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "] then , at each point @xmath45 , the point of the cusp - axis crossing , we take the ratio of the actual magnification to that predicted for the corresponding pspl lens : a point mass lens located at the caustic center with the same mass as either the whole binary ( close binaries ) or the nearest lens alone ( wide binaries ) .",
    "we proceed with the search only if this ratio lies in the interval @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "we then choose a source trajectory perpendicular to the cusp axis as an initial trial model , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and use four - parameter ( @xmath49 , @xmath37 , @xmath32 , and @xmath6 ) downhill simplex @xcite to search for a best - fit model to minimize @xmath28 , which is determined by a linear - flux fit to the model of lens magnifications ( and thus the corresponding @xmath24 and @xmath42 are found immediately ) , subject to the constraint of fixed ( @xmath3,@xmath1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : chi2cont ] shows the result of this search ( based on isis solutions ) in a contour plot of @xmath28-surface over the ( @xmath3,@xmath1)-space .",
    "the @xmath28 is rising around all the boundaries shown in figure  [ fig : chi2cont ] , except toward lower @xmath1 . while the @xmath28-surface flattens with @xmath50 as the mass ratio @xmath1 becomes very small ( @xmath51 ) for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we find no evidence of a decrease of the @xmath28 as @xmath1 becomes smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "rather it asymptotically approaches @xmath50 .",
    "we find well - localized minima of @xmath28 over the searched ( @xmath3,@xmath1)-space , one of close binaries ( @xmath55 ) and the other of wide binaries ( @xmath56 ) , whose exact parameters depend slightly on whether we use the isis or dophot photometry ( tables  [ tab : model ] and [ tab : modelw ] ) .",
    "we adopt the isis solutions in the subsequent discussion ( and they are also what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2cont ] ) because the light curve shows less scatter and consequently , the errors for the model parameter determinations are smaller . despite the combination of the dense coverage near the peak by the planet data and the extensive baseline coverage by the macho data , the final two isis models ( i.e. , the close binary and the wide binary ) are essentially indistinguishable : @xmath57 for 412 degrees of freedom , with the close binary having the lower @xmath28 of the two . in appendix  [ sec : ap ]",
    ", we discuss this degeneracy in further detail .",
    "finally , we also note that @xmath58 and @xmath59 from the best - fit binary - lens model parameters are not quite the same as the @xmath33 and @xmath31 derived from the initial degenerate form of the light curve fit .",
    "these discrepancies are traceable to small differences between a true @xcite curve and its degenerate approximation ( eq .  [ [ eqn : degen ] ] ) , and are not due to differences between the binary and corresponding pspl event , which are very small except around the peak . since the parameters derived from equation  ( [ eqn : degen ] ) function only as seeds for simplex , and since",
    "the final @xmath28-surface is very well - behaved , these discrepancies in input values do not influence the final result .",
    "the mass ratios of the best fit models are @xmath60 ( close binary ) and @xmath61 ( wide binary ) , which are well away from the regime of planetary companions ( @xmath51 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the ratio of the duration of the anomalous portion of the light curve ( @xmath62 ) to the einstein timescale ( @xmath63 ) is @xmath64 . for light curves perturbed by planetary caustics ,",
    "one typically finds @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this relation clearly does not apply to the caustics of extreme - separation binaries .",
    "models with @xmath66 ( and @xmath67 ) are formally rejected at @xmath50 , which is significant but not in itself an overwhelming rejection of the planetary hypothesis .",
    "hence , we examine the least @xmath28 model for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) for its plausibility and the origin of statistical discriminating power .",
    "we discover that the difference of @xmath28 is mostly from the macho data between hjd @xmath70 and @xmath71 , approximately 2 months prior to the photometric peak .",
    "however , we also find that the `` planetary '' model exhibits an extremely high peak magnification ( @xmath72 ) , and consequently , requires the event to be much longer ( @xmath73 ) and more extremely blended ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) than the already unusually long and highly blended best - fit models .",
    "in addition , there is a clear trend of increasing peak magnification ( and thus timescale and blend as well ) as @xmath1 is lowered beyond @xmath54 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the observed timescale of the anomaly in the light curve essentially fixes the source movement relative to the caustic .",
    "however , as @xmath1 becomes smaller , the size of the caustic relative to the einstein ring shrinks , and therefore , the timescale of the event , that is the time required for the source to cross the einstein ring , increases .",
    "( note that this behavior causes a mild continuous degeneracy between @xmath1 and the blending . )",
    "these parameters determined for the `` planetary '' model are extremely contrived and highly improbable a priori .",
    "furthermore , the timescale associated with the `` planet '' component , @xmath76 is much longer than that of typical stellar lenses , which further reduces the plausibility of the planetary interpretation . in summary , while in simple statistical terms , the star / planet scenario is not overwhelmingly disfavored relative to extreme - separation binaries , we nevertheless can conclude that it is highly unlikely that this event is due to a star / planet system .    from the standpoint of refining microlensing planet detection strategies",
    ", it is important to ask how one could have discriminated between the planetary and extreme - separation binary solutions with greater statistical significance .",
    "as noted above , most of the discriminating power came from the macho data points on the rising wing of the light curve , even though ( or in a sense , because ) these had the largest errors and the lowest density of the non - baseline coverage .",
    "that is , the precision planet photometry over the peak and falling wing `` predicts '' the rising wing for each of the models , but the noisier macho data can only roughly discriminate between these predictions .",
    "hence , the key would have been to get better data on the rising part of the light curve . in practice",
    "this is difficult : the macho data are noisier exactly because they are survey data , and one does not know to monitor an event intensively until the light curve has actually started to rise .",
    "the long duration of the event , @xmath77 ( close binary ) or @xmath78 ( wide binary ) , may lead one to expect that the event would show some sign of parallax effects @xcite .",
    "similarly , the close passage of the source to a cusp could in principle give rise to finite source effects @xcite , as for example was recently observed in the case of eros  blg-2000 - 5  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the combination of parallax and finite - source effects permitted @xcite to measure the mass of a microlens for the first time . we have therefore searched for both parallax and finite source effects , but find no significant detection of either .",
    "finally , we examine the position of the source on the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ; fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) . the most prominent feature found in the cmd",
    "is a track of stars running diagonally in the same direction as would the main sequence .",
    "since the field is in the galactic disk , this feature is probably not a true main sequence , but rather likely to be a `` reddening sequence '' , that is , an ensemble of mostly disk turnoff stars at progressively greater distances and correspondingly greater reddenings .",
    "the baseline `` star '' ( combined light of the source and blended light ) lies within this sequence toward its faint / red end although its position is seeing - dependent because of the seeing - correction term .",
    "the position indicated in the cmd is plotted assuming median seeing .",
    "however , the source itself [ @xmath79 , @xmath80 lies @xmath81 below the baseline `` star , '' in a region of the cmd that is well below the threshold of detection .",
    "if the baseline were mainly composed of source light , and the `` blended light '' were simply source light that had been falsely attributed to blending by a wrong model , then the real source would lie within the well populated `` reddening sequence '' , and the timescale would be much shorter , @xmath82 .",
    "we therefore searched for solutions with little or no blending .",
    "however , we find that these are ruled out with @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit models with no blended light are still extreme - separation binaries and not planetary systems .",
    "since we have only a crude understanding of the cmd , no strong argument can be made that the position of the source is implausible .",
    "if , in fact , the observed track of stars in figure  [ fig : cmd ] is really the reddening sequence of disk turnoff stars , the source position is consistent with a low - mass main - sequence star lying @xmath84 below the turnoff .",
    "this would also explain the lack of finite source effect .",
    "moreover , we note that in disk fields , long events are not at all uncommon @xcite because the observer , source , and lens are all moving with roughly the same velocity .",
    "regarding the large amount of blended light required to fit the observed light curve , we note that the highly significant seeing effect in the psf - based photometry ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) is also evidence that the event is strongly blended .",
    "in addition to the direct confirmation of the strong seeing effect from the comparison between the differential flux and the psf - based flux measurements , we independently detect a significant seeing correction when we fit the observed flux to the magnification model . for saao",
    "@xmath17-band observation , the seeing correction determined from the model fit using dophot flux is slightly smaller ( @xmath85 ) than the value derived from the regression between dophot and isis flux . the seeing correction derived by fitting isis data to the model is basically consistent with zero .",
    "multiple - peak events like the one seen in figure  [ fig : data ] can be caused by a binary _ source _ @xcite rather than a binary _ lens_. in general , one expects that such events will be chromatic , since the colors of the two sources will not usually be the same . by contrast ,",
    "macho  99-blg-47  is achromatic : the difference in color of the two wings of the light curve is @xmath86 . in the limit",
    "that one component of the binary is completely dark , the event will be achromatic , and yet can have still have multiple peaks caused by rotation of the binary during the event . in this case , however , there will be a series of roughly equally spaced peaks that gradually die out as the event declines @xcite , contrary to the distinct double - peaked behavior seen in figure  [ fig : data ] .",
    "hence , a binary - source explanation appears a priori implausible .    nevertheless , it is possible in principle that the source has two components of nearly identical color .",
    "we search for binary - source models , with either static or slowly moving components , but find that the best fit model has @xmath87 , which clearly rules out such models .",
    "the basic problem is that the observed second peak is very sharp given its height and the timescale of the declining light curve .",
    "binary - source light curves that fit these latter features tend to have a width that is closer to that of the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : data ] . recall that this curve represents a single - lens degenerate fit to the non - peak data .",
    "we conclude that the explanation for the double - peaked behavior of the light curve is that it is a binary - lens rather than a binary - source event .",
    "macho  99-blg-47  is the first microlensing event with a short - lived , high signal - to - noise - ratio anomaly , characteristics that could betray the existence of a planet around the lensing star .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that the lens of macho  99-blg-47  is not a planetary system , but an extreme - separation ( very close or very wide ) binary composed of components of similar mass , based on the result of the light curve fit as well as the extreme value of event duration and blending fraction required for any plausible `` planetary '' fit .",

    ", we note that @xmath118 so that the second term in the bracket is lower order than @xmath119 . in order to find the magnification for this image",
    ", we differentiate equation  ( [ eqn : quad ] ) , and find , @xmath120 \\ .\\ ] ] then substituting @xmath113 , for which @xmath117 is given by equation  ( [ eqn : delc ] ) , into equation  ( [ eqn : part ] ) , we obtain , @xmath121 \\ .\\ ] ] note that the total magnification for the given source position is usually dominated by one or two images found close to the critical curve .",
    "thus , we consider only the case for which the non - perturbed pspl images lie close to the unit circle , so we have @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "then , we find the expression for the inverse magnification for the ql approximation ( up to the order of @xmath124 ) , @xmath125    for the extreme wide - binary case , one can rewrite the lens equation  ( [ eqn : lenseq ] ) as @xmath126 here the position and the mass of the first lens component are the origin and the unit mass so that @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 . we note that , apart from the constant translation , the first non - pspl term here is essentially the shear , @xmath132 for the crl approximation .",
    "analogous to the extreme close binary , if @xmath133 , the image position for the crl approximation can be found by the perturbative approach , but here the corresponding pspl source position would be @xmath134 .",
    "then , the image deviation @xmath135 of crl from pspl is @xmath136 \\ .\\ ] ] using this result and the derivative of equation  ( [ eqn : crl ] ) , @xmath137 \\,,\\ ] ] we find @xmath138 \\ .\\ ] ] from the same argument used for the ql approximation of the extreme close binary , we can set @xmath122 , and then the inverse magnification for the crl approximation ( up to the order of @xmath139 ) is @xmath140 by comparing equations  ( [ eqn : magc ] ) and ( [ eqn : magw ] ) , we therefore establish the magnification correspondence ( up to the order of @xmath141 ) between the close binary with @xmath92 and the wide binary with @xmath91 when @xmath142 .    for the two planet isis models for macho  99-blg-47 , we obtain @xmath143 for the close binary solution @xmath144 and @xmath145 for the wide binary solution @xmath146 . hence , the observed degeneracy between the two planet models ( see   [ sec : model ] and tables  [ tab : model ] and [ tab : modelw ] ) is the clearest example of this type of correspondence observed so far . while @xcite reported that two different binary lens models , one of a close binary and the other of a wide binary , can fit the observed light curve of the ( caustic - crossing ) binary lens event , macho  98-smc-1 , .",
    "] one can infer from their figure  8 , that the degeneracy between the two models exists only for the specific light curves ( which is essentially a particular one dimensional slice of the magnification field over the source plane ) but not for the magnification field in the neighborhood of the caustic as a whole .",
    "this is obvious from the relative rotation of the two caustics .",
    "in addition , the source magnitudes for the two models of macho  98-smc-1  differ by @xmath147 .",
    "by contrast , the difference of the predicted @xmath148 between the two models of macho  99-blg-47  is only @xmath149 .",
    "in fact , we get @xmath150 ( the close binary ) and @xmath151 ( the wide binary ) for the two models of macho  98-smc-1 , and thus , although the degeneracy of the macho  98-smc-1  light curve is somehow related to the correspondence of @xmath93 , it can not be completely explained simply by the argument in this appendix , and it should be investigated further for its origin . on the other hand ,",
    "the degeneracy of macho  99-blg-47  is the first definitive observational case of the correspondence between extreme separation binaries .",
    "this can be also seen in figure  [ fig : caust ] , which illustrates the similarity between the magnification fields for the two models of macho  99-blg-47 .",
    "the very low @xmath152 between the two solutions despite the excellent data implies that it is extraordinarily difficult to break this degeneracy with photometric data .",
    "@xcite showed that for macho  98-smc-1  the two solutions were also astrometrically degenerate , at least for data streams lying within a few @xmath37 of the peak .",
    "they argued that this astrometric degeneracy , like the corresponding photometric degeneracy , was rooted in the lens equation .",
    "however , as shown in this appendix , the correspondence between the equations describing close- and wide - binaries is _ purely local _ ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for example , there is a constant - offset term in equation  ( [ eqn : crl ] ) , which does not give rise to any local photometric or astrometric effects , but which must `` disappear '' at late times .",
    "hence there must be a late - time astrometric shift between the two solutions .",
    "such a shift was noted explicitly by @xcite for the case of macho  98-smc-1 , and these are likely to be a generic feature of close / wide corresponding pairs of solutions .",
    "we also plot the lines of ( @xmath3,@xmath1 ) pairs that have the same shear @xmath88 as the best - fit wide - binary model or the same quadrupole moment @xmath89 as the best - fit close - binary model on @xmath28-surface contour plot shown in figure  [ fig : chi2cont ] .",
    "while the iso - shear line for wide binaries lies nearly parallel to the direction of the principal conjugate near the best - fit model , it is clear from the figure that the condition of @xmath142 alone does not define the observed well - defined two - fold degeneracy , which involves the additional correspondence between higher order terms beyond the quadrupole moment ( @xmath153 ) and the pure shear ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "further comparison between equations  ( [ eqn : magc ] ) and ( [ eqn : magw ] ) indicates that there exists a magnification correspondence up to the order of @xmath155 if the condition @xmath156 is also satisfied in addition to @xmath157 .",
    "we find that , for the two planet models , @xmath158 ( the close binary ) and @xmath159 ( the wide binary ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that , in fact , these two conditions , @xmath160 @xmath161 define a unique correspondence between two extreme separation binaries .",
    "we also note that the images ( not shown ) of the iso-@xmath152 contours for the close binary models of macho  99-blg-47  under the mapping defined by the above two relations follows extremely closely the corresponding iso-@xmath152 contour for wide binary models , except for the difference of @xmath162 offset between two solutions .",
