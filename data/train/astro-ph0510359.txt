    "in the last few years , there have been a large number of different approaches to the dark energy enigma . as is well - known , the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation  @xcite and data from type ia supernovae  @xcite , are well - fit by a cosmological constant , albeit a fine - tuned one , of which we have no satisfactory theoretical understanding .",
    "another possibility is that the cosmological constant is precisely zero ( or at most subdominant ) and that a dynamical component is driving cosmic acceleration .",
    "this component may be a manifestation of a large - scale modification of general relativity @xcite , or a new dynamical field , such as a scalar field @xcite .",
    "it is quite natural to consider scalar fields that are non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "such fields arise both in the context of string theory , and in more general theories with extra spatial dimensions .",
    "these fields are typically of the brans - dicke ( bd ) type , and have been considered in a large variety of other cosmological contexts , such as inflation and baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "however , there exist tight constraints on bd fields .",
    "some of these constraints are on solar system scales , constraining the bd parameter to satisfy @xmath0 .",
    "other constraints arise from cosmology itself .",
    "for example , in order not to spoil the success of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) predictions , the scalar field component should be subdominant to radiation and the scale factor must evolve nearly as @xmath1 .",
    "this constraint is quite well accepted , and a detailed analysis of the constraints on other kinds of evolutions , such as dark matter dominated one , can be found in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit this particular issue , considering whether a bd scalar field might play a _",
    "significant _ role in cosmic evolution during bbn , while maintaining an acceptable evolution of the scale factor .",
    "we shall only require the bd field to drive the kinematics of the universe , making it expand _ as if _ radiation dominates .",
    "it should be emphasized that in our model the expansion rate ( hubble function @xmath2 ) is driven by the bd field , while the scattering rates are determined by cross sections and abundances of the standard fields of the plasma ( @xmath3 , neutrinos , photons , baryons ) .",
    "one consequence is that the relation between temperature and time becomes an adjustable parameter in this model .",
    "provided the bd field can reproduce a standard kinematics @xmath4 , one is free e.g.  to normalize the abundances of all the fields to the value they assume at the same @xmath4 in the standard model . since they do not interact with the bd field but gravitationally , the particles in the plasma can not distinguish which component is driving the evolution of the universe , and they will interact among themselves in the same way as if the bd field is not present . as a consequence ,",
    "the production rate for the light elements is the same and the freeze - out temperatures for the reactions are unchanged .",
    "the big difference between this model and other bd models during bbn ( see e.g. @xcite ) , is that now the bd field , i.e  newton s constant , can be largely different from today s value at the time of bbn .",
    "this is quite different from a standard approach in which the bd field is allowed to be just slightly different from today s value .",
    "however , just after bbn , some non - trivial dynamics is required to bring the bd fields to values consistent with a standard evolution for the universe .",
    "this is sufficient to ensure that the temperature of the universe has the usual behavior from the end of bbn up to now .",
    "we shall see that such a scenario is possible , while remaining consistent with solar system constraints .",
    "however , as one might expect , this interesting possibility can only arise under finely tuned conditions .",
    "we describe the tuning required , both on the initial conditions of the scalar and on its associated potential .",
    "to study the cosmological aspects of this theory in the framework of a homogeneous and isotropic universe , we use the friedmann , robertson - walker ( frw ) ansatz for the metric @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scale factor and @xmath21 is conformal time , related to the usual cosmic time through @xmath22 .",
    "we have assumed a zero curvature contribution , consistent with current data .",
    "in the standard scenario , the universe is radiation dominated during bbn .",
    "this requirement leads to theoretical expectations that are in reasonable agreement with observations , at least at the 2 @xmath28 level .",
    "in particular the deuterium number density  @xcite points to a value for the baryon content of the universe which is within 1-@xmath28 equal to the independent determination of this parameter extracted from the cmb power spectrum  @xcite @xmath29 this result is compatible with a radiation content given by photons and three weakly interacting neutrinos / antineutrinos ( for a review of the present status of standard bbn see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , present data still leave room for a non - standard energy density content , or a non standard value for the hubble expansion rate .",
    "for example , the analysis carried out in @xcite shows that a conservative observational range for the helium-4 mass fraction constrains any extra contribution or deficit in the radiation energy content in the range @xmath30 , when parameterizing it in terms of extra effective neutrino species .    in view of these considerations ,",
    "the main question we would like to address is whether it is still possible that the bd field @xmath31 contributes during bbn in a non negligible way .",
    "the effect of @xmath31 can be easily discerned from eq .",
    "( [ eqzns2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , its dynamics affects the value of the gravitational constant which scales as @xmath32 and which ties the energy - density to the expansion rate .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of @xmath31 provides extra contributions to the hubble parameter .",
    "the usual assumption is to consider a negligible role of the functions @xmath33 ( the `` potential energy term '' ) and @xmath34 ( the `` kinetic energy term '' ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqzns2 ] ) , is somehow imprecise , since their sum does not correspond in general to a covariantly conserved energy density .",
    "nevertheless they are useful quantities to quantify the contribution of the bd field dynamics to the expansion rate and moreover , their sum is covariantly conserved in the limit of very large @xmath35 and negligible energy density @xmath26 of standard matter which we discuss in this section , see e.g. @xcite . ]",
    "so that the usual bbn scenario is only possibly changed by a different value of the effective gravitational constant or , equivalently , of a re - scaled energy density , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the same bound previously quoted in term of @xmath36 then translates into @xmath37 .      using the covariant conservation of the energy for standard matter @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ norma ] ) can be further simplified into @xmath54    we are interested in a situation in which the expansion rate of the universe is of the order of the standard value leading to a successful bbn , and yet the @xmath31 contribution is relevant or even dominant . by inspection of ( [ eqzns2 ] )",
    "we see that in order for these conditions to hold , the energy density @xmath26 should be suppressed by a value of @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , the new terms , which are dependent on the dynamics of @xmath31 , should _ mimic _ a radiation dominated behavior and compensate for the reduced contribution of ordinary radiation to the expansion rate . in order to see whether this scenario is in fact possible at all",
    ", we start by considering the simplest case , in which ordinary radiation and matter contribute negligibly to the kinematics .",
    "of course , this means that we have to check _ a posteriori _ that , during bbn , it is possible to choose values of @xmath31 large enough so that @xmath26 is sufficiently suppressed .",
    "the leading contribution to  ( [ eqzns2 ] ) will then be provided by the dynamics of @xmath31 .",
    "field versus @xmath48 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the field bounces back at @xmath62 where @xmath77 . ]",
    "notice that since @xmath35 is very large , in the interval @xmath78 the two solutions can be expressed with an accuracy better than @xmath79 as _",
    "( a)= _ 0 ( 1 a )  .",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ phia ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ pott ] ) ( and neglecting @xmath26 ) one has @xmath80 where the last expression holds for large @xmath35 .",
    "let us summarize the results obtained so far . by considering a potential of the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ pot2 ] ) , the expansion rate of the universe due to a bd field behaves the same way as during a radiation dominated regime .",
    "depending on the sign of the power - index in @xmath50 , there are two possible behaviors for the field @xmath31 , increasing or decreasing with cosmic expansion .",
    "the @xmath31 field rolls very smoothly along the potential , and with comparable `` kinetic '' and `` potential '' energy densities @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "since we derived these results in the limit @xmath83 , we must check that this condition is compatible with the solution found .",
    "indeed , it is easily seen that the term @xmath82 in eq.([pot2 ] ) is independent from the value of @xmath61 , while the term @xmath84 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath61 arbitrarily large .",
    "this implies that provided we choose the initial value for @xmath31 to be sufficiently large , the contribution of ordinary radiation can be neglected , and the expansion of the universe follows @xmath85 despite the fact that it is driven by a bd scalar field .",
    "in the previous section we have found that there are two solutions for which a bd field dominates cosmic dynamics , while keeping a radiation - dominated expansion as in eq .",
    "( [ radia ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the phenomenological requirement of preserving in this scenario the general agreement between bbn predictions and the observed light element yields . of course",
    ", the scenario outlined in the previous section of a pure @xmath31-dominated universe can not describe the late stages of cosmic evolution .",
    "indeed this would be at variance with the fact that today we require @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , with the potential considered in the previous section , the universe would continue to expand as in a radiation dominated regime until very small redshifts .",
    "we do not address these issues further here , but it is clear that a more complicated dynamics after the bbn period is required in order to bring such kind of models in accordance with `` late '' cosmological and astrophysical observables . in the following ,",
    "in particular we will assume that cmb observations are explained as in the standard scenario .",
    "the set of equations governing bbn , besides equations  ( [ eqzns1 ] ) and  ( [ eqzns2 ] ) , is the following ( see e.g.  @xcite ) 1n_b&=&-3h + & = & -3h(+p ) + & = & _ i(x_j ) + l(m_e / t,_e)&=&_j z_jx_j + ( _ t - h|p|_|p| ) f__(|p| , t)&=&i__[f__e , f_|_e ,  ]  .",
    "the first two equations state respectively the conservation of the total baryon number and energy density in a comoving volume .",
    "the third equation is the boltzmann equation which describes the density of each nuclide species , with the @xmath87 being the rates of interaction averaged over the kinetic equilibrium distribution functions .",
    "the fourth equation accounts for the electric charge neutrality of the universe in terms of the electron chemical potential @xmath88 . finally , the last equation is the boltzmann equation for the neutrino species .",
    "it is clear that the field @xmath31 never explicitly enters these equations but does appear in the evolution of the hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , as long as the evolution of @xmath2 in the bd case is indistinguishable from the standard case , adopting initial conditions ( at whatever @xmath89mev ) for the matter and radiation fields analogous to the standard case , the production of the light elements will also be unchanged .",
    "however , even in the scenario described in the previous section there is one relevant departure , since the hubble factor evolves strictly as @xmath90 , while in the standard case this evolution is modified because @xmath91 annihilation changes the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "note that this phenomenon happens just between the two crucial temperatures for bbn ; @xmath92mev at which the neutron / proton ratio freezes , and @xmath93mev when the deuterium bottleneck opens and light element production begins .",
    "if the bd hubble rate matches one of the two conditions , it might fail to match the second one . to test",
    "if such a difference can be accommodated at all , we have run the bbn code described in @xcite by assuming that the dominant contribution to @xmath2 is provided by the bd field , and its behavior is as for pure radiation as discussed in the previous section . to this end",
    "we replace the standard matter / radiation energy density @xmath26 in the hubble law ( and only there ! ) with the following parametrization in terms of a single neutrino energy density @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in the limit in which the solution previously found holds ,",
    "this useful parametrization is _",
    "exact_. we ask if there is any value at all for the factor @xmath97 which can accommodate at least @xmath42he and @xmath9h abundances .",
    "since we assume that the standard cosmology holds for @xmath98 , we fix the baryon abundance to that deduced from the cmb , eq .",
    "( [ omcmb ] ) .",
    "note that , since there are two conditions to fulfill with only one parameter , the constraint is non - trivial .",
    "we find that , for @xmath99 the conservative constraint on the @xmath42he mass fraction @xmath100 quoted in  @xcite is satisfied , while predicting a deuterium fraction @xmath101 @xmath9h / h @xmath102 , comparable with the observed one @xmath9/h@xmath103 @xcite within 2@xmath104 . for @xmath97 in the range of eq .",
    "( [ boundy ] ) we also found @xmath105 @xmath41he / h @xmath106 , which is consistent with present bounds @xcite , and @xmath107 @xmath43li / h @xmath108 , which remains a factor @xmath109 3 larger than the observed one @xcite .",
    "( light grey ) contours in the @xmath121 plane . ]",
    "it should be noticed that to impose the condition that bd behaves as radiation , or that @xmath125 corresponds to the choice of a particular potential . in principle",
    "one should show that this choice is possible . in order to see",
    "if this is indeed sensible , we use  ( [ potenza ] ) in equations ( [ eqzns1])([eqzns2 ] ) and find that a solution can be found by taking the time derivative of these two equations .",
    "the outcome is a system of nonlinear 2@xmath126 order differential equations in @xmath48 and @xmath31 .",
    "there is only one independent initial condition",
    " the choice of @xmath127since @xmath128 can be found by using equation  ( [ eqzns2 ] ) , and since equation  ( [ eqzns1 ] ) becomes a cubic equation in @xmath129 .",
    "this means that the system becomes uniquely determined and the solution does indeed exist and it is unique .",
    "we have revisited the constraints on a brans - dicke scalar field , arising from the requirement of successful nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is an important question in light of the different roles that a brans - dicke field @xmath31 may play in various sectors of cosmology , such as inflation , baryogenesis and dark energy .",
    "indeed , we have found that the bd field , i.e.  newton s constant , can have significantly different values from today s one , and at the same time dominate the energy density making the universe behave as if radiation dominates .",
    "the matter content is not changed at all , so that all physical quantities such as freeze - out temperatures and decay / production rates for elements do not differ from standard ones .    in other words , we have found that it is possible for the bd field to mimic the effect of radiation on the evolution of the cosmic scale factor . in such a case @xmath31 is the dominant contributor to the hubble parameter during bbn .",
    "we have put constraints on the bd potential using the observed light elements yields and the bbn predictions in such a modified scenario .",
    "this scenario requires a large initial value for @xmath130 so that the standard contribution of matter to the expansion rate is suppressed by the reduced value of the effective newton constant , as well as potential for the bd field @xmath50 that scales as a power law in @xmath31 , w/^2  . here",
    "@xmath131 if we assume that the local result of the cassini mission also holds on cosmological scales .",
    "we do not offer any suggestion how to explain such an high exponent . by numerically solving the set of bbn equations we have found that it is indeed possible to tune the overall scale of the potential @xmath50 , see eq .",
    "( [ resfin ] ) , so as to obtain final yields for both @xmath9h and @xmath42he compatible with the observed data .",
    "of course , one may worry that large values of @xmath31 at the bbn epoch are not compatible with today s value .",
    "in fact , if we considered the same effective potential valid until today , the field @xmath31 would keep on being the dominant component of the universe , leading to a completely different evolution for the universe , e.g. an extrapolation would lead to value for the field @xmath31 incompatible with today s value for the newton gravitational constant . therefore , after bbn , the potential should be chosen such that the field decreases to acceptable values , and the universe follows a standard evolution .",
    "the fact that today s value of @xmath31 imposes an upper bound on the possibility of having very large values for @xmath132 is tantamount to saying that a fine - tuning of the choice of the potential is necessary in order to allow a huge change in the value of the field from bbn up to now .",
    "finally , we have considered the more general scenario where both standard radiation and the bd field contribute to the expansion rate , in the case that the bd dynamics again corresponds to a pure radiation behavior . in this case too , by comparing the theoretical prediction with light nuclei abundances , we have found that , depending on the value of the bd field during bbn and its contribution to @xmath2 , there is a region in this two - parameter space leading to successful nucleosynthesis .",
    "this region shown in figure  [ fig : likely ] extends from the high @xmath31 regime already discussed down to the standard scenario with @xmath86 showing that provided the @xmath31 potential is suitably tuned , basically all values of the bd field can be shown to be compatible with the abundances of both @xmath9h and @xmath42he produced during bbn .",
    "an interesting feature of the scenario considered in this paper is that one is basically free to adjust the time - temperature relation , which analytically means rescaling the initial conditions for the thermodynamical quantities of the fluids in the plasma .",
    "we have limited our discussion to the case where @xmath4 around the bbn epoch has the same evolution it would have in a radiation - dominated plasma , keeping the particle densities fixed at the same value of the standard case as our initial conditions .",
    "this is not a fine - tuning required a priori , but an useful working hypothesis which authomatically ensures that the rates for the scattering processes ( including the nuclear reactions ) are unchanged .",
    "however , one may relax this assumption , and thus the allowed region in the model space may enlarge considerably , to the price of major ( and model - dependent ) modifications in the physical processes in the plasma .",
    "we do not discuss further this point in our phenomenological approach , since our purpose in this article was to show that exotic scenarios where the bd field is driving the expansion rate at the bbn epoch are indeed possible .",
    "nonetheless , this feature should be kept in mind when characterizing specific models ( as e.g. quintessence potentials with solutions tracking radiation ) with a cosmic evolution before and after the bbn epoch determined self - consistently within the theory .",

    "<S> we reconsider constraints on brans - dicke theories arising from the requirement of successful big bang nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> such constraints typically arise by imposing that the universe be radiation - dominated at early times , and therefore restricting the contribution that a brans - dicke scalar could make to the energy budget of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this paper we show how the dynamics of the brans - dicke scalar itself can mimic a radiation - dominated kinematics , thereby allowing successful nucleosynthesis with a sizable contribution to the total cosmic energy density . </S>",
    "<S> in other words newton s constant may dynamically acquire values quite different from that today , even though the evolution mimics radiation domination . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility significantly relaxes the existing bounds on brans - dicke fields , and opens the door to new possibilities for early universe cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary fine tunings required by such an arrangement are identified and discussed . </S>",
