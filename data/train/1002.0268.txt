    "schrdinger had pointed out long time ago @xcite that quantum entanglement is a crucial element of quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact quantum entanglement is one of the most peculiar feature that distinguishes quantum physics from classical physics and lies at the heart of what is now quantum information theory .",
    "quantum physics allows correlations between spatially separated systems that are fundamentally different from classical correlations , and this difference becomes evident when entangled states violate bell - type inequalities that place an upper bound on the correlations compatible with local hidden variable ( or local realistic ) theories @xcite . in the last two decades research has been very focused on quantum entanglement because the field of quantum information theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) has developed rather quickly to be an important one .",
    "it is very important to get a good understanding of entanglement properties of the quantum states , under effects of accelerations ( lorentz transformations ) and magnetic fields ( constant and homogeneous ) , e.g. , in studying quantum entangled states of the particles that are produced and detected in stern - gerlach experiments @xcite .",
    "the issues of quantum entanglement in ( constant ) external magnetic field were addressed in a previous paper @xcite , through the approach of wigner rotations of canonical spin .",
    "considering frames of observers related through lorentz transformations , it was shown that the entanglement is frame _ independent _ but the violation of bell s inequality is frame _ dependent_. similar features and correlations ( or degrees of entanglement ) were noted for spins undergoing precession in a magnetic field in that study .",
    "however , the study of quantum entanglement in magnetic fields was limited to 2-particle states of total spin zero . here",
    "we study entangled 3-particle states in constant external magnetic fields and display the emergence of remarkable _ periodic _ correlations and density matrices .",
    "note that consequent features of the 2-particle sub - systems can also be extracted from them . to our knowledge ,",
    "such a study of periodicities in correlations and density matrices is being presented and analysed for the first time .",
    "we then introduce an electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field , and obtain the corresponding wigner rotations of the spin states . in this paper",
    ", we also propose a new scheme of systematic classification of the entangled states corresponding to well - known ones in the study of 3-particle entanglements ( viz .",
    "greenberger - horne - zeilinger @xmath0 , werner @xmath1 , flipped werner @xmath2 and their variant states ) , using a particular coupling of three angular momenta .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we introduce the notations and formalism in section ii . in sections",
    "iii and iv , the emerging patterns of periodicity in correlations and density matrices , respectively , are studied explicitly for different entangled states , and particularly for certain initial configuration of the velocities . in section",
    "v , we study the case with an electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field , linking to the preceding case via lorentz transformation , and obtain the corresponding wigner rotations of the spin states . in section",
    "vi , we demonstrate the proposed scheme of systematic classification of the entangled states corresponding to well - known ones in the study of 3-particle entanglements , using the particular coupling of three angular momenta . finally , we make some concluding remarks and give an outlook of future directions of work in section vii .",

    "@xcite , and review articles @xcite ) will be used and generalized .",
    "2 .   a particularly simple configuration of the initial velocities is then selected for detailed study ( later in section iii ) . this would permit us to display the contents of the generalized equations , for a few selected cases of particular interest without obscuring the basic features due to a profusion of parameters . +",
