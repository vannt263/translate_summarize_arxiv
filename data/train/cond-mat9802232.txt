    "in a series of intermetallic compound rmn@xmath0 ( r = rare earth ) , an existence of magnetic moments on mn sites depends largely on an inter - atomic mn - mn distance@xcite . above a critical distance of @xmath11=2.7",
    "@xmath12 m there exists a magnetic moment on the mn which is antiferromagnetically ordered in general . below this critical distance",
    "the ground state remains paramagnetic down to lowest temperature .",
    "this fact that the mn - mn inter - atomic distance plays a key - role in determining their magnetic properties indicates that these compounds may be magnetically sensitive to such a perturbation as a chemical substitution or an application of pressure .",
    "an interesting possibility is then that an application of pressure induces quantum critical phase transition governed by the zero point quantum spin fluctuation . in particular",
    "this is the case of ymn@xmath0 which exhibits antiferromagnetic ( af ) order with a nel temperature around 100  k at ambient pressure .",
    "a relatively low pressure of @xmath13=3 to 4  kbar is enough to suppress the af order@xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic to af magnetic transition upon cooling is of first order type accompanying by well pronounced hysteretic phenomena in various measurements .",
    "therefore , the af to paramagnetic phase transition across @xmath14 is anticipated to be first order type .",
    "so far it is reported that the paramagnetic state at ambient pressure is dominated by the af spin fluctuations @xcite which is well treated in terms of the self - consistent renormalized ( scr ) spin fluctuation theory developed by moriya et al . @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the sc - substitution of y suppresses the af order and the spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic phase was reported to be well described in terms of the scr theory @xcite . on the other hand , the inelastic neutron scattering experiment has found that the singlet correlation among four mn spins forming the tetrahedron is developed to stabilize this paramagnetic phase , i.e. , a kind of spin liquid state is formed in the sc substituted system .",
    "thus , it is still controversial whether or not this novel character of spin fluctuations is actually related to the nature in the paramagnetic state above @xmath1 in ymn@xmath0 because the effect of disorder induces by the sc -substitution is not addressed yet . in other words ,",
    "we address the question whether or not , near the critical point in ymn@xmath0 where the nel temperature is suppressed to zero , the af spin fluctuations are also critical with a damping energy tending to zero .",
    "an application of pressure to suppress the af order is promising to settle these issues , because this is the only way to stabilize the paramagnetic state in ymn@xmath0 at low temperatures without any disorderliness .",
    "the aim of this paper is to enligthten the evolution of low - energy magnetic excitations in the pressure - induced paramagnetic phase by approaching the critical point from the higher pressure side .",
    "a polycrystalline sample has been crushed in fine powder in order to ensure the penetration of the radio - frequency pulsed field .",
    "a conventional clamp - type pressure cell was employed for the nmr experiment under pressure with use of the fluorinert liquid as the pressure transmitting medium .",
    "the fluorinert volume was of the proportion as the sample volume and froze below 200  k. to calibrate the pressure at the sample position at low temperature , the pressure shift in @xmath15 of lead powder was monitored .",
    "the measurement of @xmath15 was performed by an inductive method using the in - situ nmr coil in a resonant circuit .",
    "the nqr spectrum has been obtained by plotting the spin - echo intensity as a function of frequency with an interval of 50  khz .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath16 , was measured by the saturation recovery method in a temperature range of @xmath17  k. for the nqr transition of @xmath18 , the recovery function of nuclear magnetization , m , is given by @xmath19 and the spin - lattice relaxation time was uniquely determined by a fit of the data with the above formula .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] indicates the evolution of the @xmath20mn nqr spectrum for the @xmath21 transition at @xmath22  k under pressure . with increasing pressure",
    ", the spectrum experiences a slight shift towards a higher frequency side , reflecting an increase of the electric field gradient ( efg ) .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum in a series of nqr spectra does not change appreciably , which means that the pressure - induced distribution in efg can be ignored .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath16 was not measured above 120  k in order to avoid a melting of the transmitting liquid medium at high temperatures which increases the pressure effectively . the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath6 , which is plotted with the semi - logarithmic scale in temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , shows the possible existence of two regimes marked by a kink ( arrows ) .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to this cross - over temperature as a characteristic spin fluctuation temperature , @xmath24 , in the pressure - induced paramagnetic phase .",
    "@xmath5 increases from 30  k with increasing pressure . below @xmath5 , @xmath6 becomes weakly temperature dependent .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath25 , is in general related to the transverse component of the imaginary part in the dynamical magnetic susceptibility @xmath26 such as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei studied , @xmath29 the number of atoms , @xmath30 the hyperfine coupling constant , and @xmath31 the nmr frequency ( @xmath32 represents the transverse component of the generalized susceptibility ) . in the case of nearly antiferromagnetic metals , the q dependence of the low - energy spin fluctuations",
    "are dominated by the components close of the af vector * * q**=*q * and the main contribution will thus be such as @xmath33 . therefore eq .  ( [ equ2 ] ) can be given by a simple form of @xmath34 the pressure and thermal dependences of @xmath6 thus allow us to probe corresponding dependences of af spin fluctuation . in the framework of the scr theory the dynamical susceptibility is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the parameter to make the self - consistency equation valid , the non - interacting susceptibility @xmath37 and @xmath38 the coulomb intra - site interaction .",
    "the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ equ4 ] ) is equivalent to the stoner factor which tends to zero at the criticality and @xmath39 .",
    "correspondingly the divergence of @xmath40 means the divergence in the static staggered susceptibility and as a result , it is expected that @xmath41 undergoes a divergence at @xmath39 or it is largely enhanced approaching @xmath42 .",
    "however , the experiment does not follow the above expectation .",
    "rather , the development of af spin fluctuations is saturated upon cooling and approaching the @xmath39 .",
    "namely , @xmath5 does not tend to zero , but seems to remain finite even at @xmath39 .",
    "this may due to the first order nature of the transition from the af state to paramagnetic at @xmath39 induced by pressure . above",
    "@xmath5 , the spin fluctuations are dominated by thermal fluctuations which are treated in terms of the scr theory , whereas 1/@xmath43 approaches a constant value below @xmath5 characteristic for the fermi liquid excitation .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicates the pressure dependence of @xmath44 deduced from the present @xmath16 measurement . from the electrical resistivity measurements under pressure , the spin fluctuation temperature was defined as the cross - over temperature below which the thermal variation of @xmath45 obeys the expected fermi liquid @xmath46 law@xcite",
    "remarkably , a fairly good agreement is obtained concerning the variation of both @xmath47 under pressure @xmath48 with these experimental implications , it is possible that the development in spin fluctuation remains in short - range upon cooling .",
    "from the thermal variation of the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate , @xmath49 of @xmath20mn above the critical pressure of 4  kbar , the spin fluctuation feature has been found to change below the temperature @xmath5 . at",
    "temperatures higher than @xmath5 , the nuclear relaxation behavior is well described in terms of the self - consistent renormalized spin fluctuation theory for a nearly af metal , whereas below @xmath5 , a deviation from that is significant and @xmath50 exhibits a weak temperature variation . it is pointed out that @xmath47 coincides with the temperature below which a @xmath46 law in resistivity is valid as expected for the fermi liquid state .",
    "we proposed that these features are understood from the view that the development in af spin fluctuation remains in short - range associated with the singlet formation among mn spins in each tetrahedron as suggested by the inelastic neutron experiments on y@xmath8sc@xmath9mn@xmath0 ."
