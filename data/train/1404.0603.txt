    "one of the most important steps in the study of the atomic nuclei was the discovery of the nuclear magic numbers @xcite . despite the great success of the spin - orbit force in explaining the closed shells and subshells in the nuclear stability valley",
    ", there is a long standing controversy about its adequacy near the drip lines . in recent years",
    ", both theoretical and experimental results indicate the formation of new magic numbers @xcite and it seems that a large part of our knowledge about the location of magic numbers should be renewed in the near future .    over the last few decades",
    ", there is an ongoing argument about the nature of the @xmath0ca nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , these studies could not reach a common conclusion about the magicity of the @xmath0ca nucleus .",
    "one of the appropriate theoretical approach to predict nuclear shell effects is the self - consistent mean field method .",
    "this is the purpose of the present work .    in a recent experiment ,",
    "very striking results were obtained by d. steppenbeck et al . @xcite .",
    "the data from the spectroscopic study of the neutron - rich @xmath0ca nucleus using proton knock - out reactions reveal the doubly magic nature of this nucleus . the first @xmath7 state is found at about 2 mev , thus indicating a magic structure where the neutron @xmath9 subshells would be occupied whereas the neutron @xmath10 level would be empty . in order to get a clear understanding of the experimental results ,",
    "theoretical predictions are thus needed .    in the last decade",
    ", it has been shown that the tensor force plays an active role in the shell evolution of nuclei .",
    "the tensor component of the effective n - n interaction contributes also to the spin - orbit part of the nuclear mean field and thus , it can affect considerably the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "energies @xcite . in the hartree - fock ( hf )",
    "type of description , the tensor force is either added directly to the known skyrme interactions ( e.g. , sly5+t @xcite ) or all skyrme terms including the tensor component are refitted on the empirical ground state properties ( e.g. , the tij family of force parameters , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . detailed explanations and more information about the tensor force can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . recently , adding the tensor term to the known sly5 force could explain well the experimental energy differences between the s.p . states of z=50 isotopes and n=82 isotones @xcite .",
    "in addition , the emergence of the magicity in the @xmath8ca and @xmath0ca nuclei occurs when skyrme - hartree - fock calculations are performed with the sly5 force plus an added tensor component @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "investigation of the tensor effects on the s.p .",
    "energies and the first @xmath6=@xmath7 excited state can provide valuable information for the interpretation of the experimental results .    in this work , as a first step we present the effect of the tensor force on the shell evolution of n=34 isotones : @xmath1fe , @xmath2cr , @xmath3ti and @xmath0ca nuclei with both hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) and hf+bcs models using the skyrme - type sly5 ( without tensor ) @xcite and sly5+t , t44@xcite ( with tensor ) interactions .",
    "among the many possible tensor parameter sets in the literature , we choose sly5+t and t44 to illustrate the tensor force effects . the sly5 interaction is designed for describing satisfactorily exotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "furthermore , addition of a tensor force on top of sly5 helps to explain the observed s.p .",
    "spectrum @xcite , which makes sly5+t appropriate for illustrating the tensor force effects . to check the reliability of the results",
    ", we also use t44 which is another skyrme interaction containing a tensor component .",
    "since the t44 interaction contains both the like - particle and proton - neutron tensor terms , it is also meaningful to study its predictions . the calculated s.p .",
    "energies with and without tensor force are compared at the mean field level .",
    "then , the low - lying @xmath6=@xmath7 states are calculated within qrpa on top of hf+bcs for the ca isotopic chain . finally , conclusions are drawn on the possible magicity of @xmath0ca .",
    "in this section , we discuss the calculated shell evolution of the n=34 isotonic chain using the hfb method@xcite . in addition , we show that the hfb and hf+bcs methods yield very similar mean field properties , thus giving us more confidence in the quasi - particle ( q.p . ) rpa ( qrpa ) results presented in the next section .",
    "the details of the hf+bcs and hfb calculations can be found in refs .",
    "we present the results obtained with and without the tensor force in order to investigate the magic nature of the @xmath0ca nucleus .    to study the effects of the tensor force on the s.p .",
    "energies of the n=34 isotonic chain , we compare the results obtained with sly5 , sly5+t and t44 interactions .",
    "the sly5+t and t44 interactions include tensor force components . in our calculations ,",
    "the tensor interaction parameters are @xmath11 - 170 mev.@xmath12 , @xmath13100 mev.@xmath12 for sly5+t and @xmath118.96 mev.@xmath12 , @xmath13113.02 mev.@xmath12 for t44 .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by :    @xmath16    where t and u are the strengths of the original tensor force @xcite .",

    "@xmath24 ) is adjusted according to the experimental binding energies and two - neutron separation energies of the calcium isotopic chain .",
    "additionally , the first 2@xmath25 states of @xmath26ca isotopes have been used to obtain a proper pairing strength value .",
    "all calculations are performed in a 20 fm box with 0.1 fm mesh size and a quasiparticle energy cut - off equal to 60 mev . in our calculations , the maximum angular momentum value is taken as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) for neutrons ( protons ) . in the hfb approach the canonical quasiparticle energies @xmath29",

    "the results indicate a non - magic @xmath0ca nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , the results obtained with sly5+t ( lower panels of fig.[100 ] ) are somewhat different .",

    "energies of n=34 isotones and they give no pairing in the @xmath0ca nucleus . comparing sly5 and sly5+t spectra clearly shows that the tensor force enhances the occupied - unoccupied level gap . to check the model dependence of the results",
    ", we have performed the same calculations with the t44 interaction@xcite .",

    "another clue about the influence of pairing effects on the shell structure of ca isotopes is found in the evolution of the first @xmath7 state . since the calculated q.p .",
    "spectra are very similar in hfb and hf+bcs descriptions , it is appropriate to perform qrpa calculations @xcite on top of the hf+bcs scheme in order to study this evolution .",
    "our aim is to see the effects of the tensor force on the first 2@xmath25 state and to compare with the data in ca isotopic chain . in the qrpa part of the calculations ,",
    "skyrme energy density functionals are used in the derivation of the p - h matrix elements which also includes spin - orbit and two - body coulomb interactions@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the tensor force is just used in the mean field part of the calculations but it is not included in the residual interaction part of the present qrpa study .",
    "however , the effect of the residual p - h tensor interaction is expected to be rather small in the @xmath7 excitations @xcite",

    ", the first @xmath7 states of the ca isotopes are coming from single 2-q.p .",
    "inclusion of the tensor force has almost no effect from @xmath37ca to @xmath38ca and the predictions are in agreement with the data .",
    "however , the energies of the first @xmath7 states in @xmath39ca , @xmath8ca and @xmath0ca are increased by the tensor force .",
    "this increase is about 1.43 mev , 1.82 mev and 1.43 mev , respectively .",
    "in addition , the first @xmath7 states of the @xmath39ca , @xmath8ca and @xmath0ca nuclei exhibit pure neutron s.p . excitations : ( @xmath40-@xmath41 ) , ( @xmath42-@xmath43 ) and ( @xmath34-@xmath44 ) , respectively .    the first @xmath7 state of @xmath0ca nucleus has been discussed before in shell model approach @xcite which are not able to predict the observed energies in ref . @xcite . in @xmath0ca",
    ", we obtain a good agreement with the latest experimental results .",
    "inclusion of the tensor force in the mean field part of the calculations explains well the behavior of the first @xmath7 states in this nucleus .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ 102 ] , we show the b(e2 ) values calculated with and without the tensor interaction .",
    "the tensor force does not modify much the b(e2 ) values , as expected .",
    "however , the qrpa b(e2 ) values with and without tensor force are not in agreement with the data .",
    "this is a general drawback of rpa and qrpa that the electromagnetic transition probabilities of collective low - lying states are generally not well described , even in stable nuclei .",
    "this may be related to the property that the rpa approach is better suited for describing collective modes corresponding to an irrotational flow in a hydrodynamic picture @xcite , which is the case for giant resonances but not so much so for low - lying electric modes .",
    "in this work , we have employed both hfb and hf+bcs methods to study the ground states of n=34 isotones with the aim of exploring the possible magic nature of @xmath0ca .",
    "the calculations were performed with skyrme type interactions , without ( sly5 ) and with a tensor component ( sly5+t , t44 ) .",
    "this choice is guided by the fact that the tensor force affects the s.p .",
    "spectra and thus , it can change the magicity behavior of those nuclei . the evolution of the s.p .",
    "spectra was explored .",
    "we do not obtain a clear sign of sub - shell closure with the sly5 interaction , but the addition of a tensor force component quite enhances the energy difference between the s.p .",
    "states , thus leading to a subshell closure in @xmath0ca .",
    "we have also investigated the first @xmath7 states in the ca isotopic chain , again with and without the tensor component in the skyrme interaction .",
    "the tensor force leads to an increased energy of the first @xmath7 state in the calcium isotopic chain .",
    "both @xmath8ca and @xmath0ca show a magic nature .",
    "especially , the first @xmath7 state of @xmath0ca is well reproduced when compared with the experimental results .",
    "however , the b(e2 ) values are not well reproduced , as it is often the case with qrpa applied to low - lying collective states in spherical nuclei .",
    "the results indicate the importance of the tensor force on the shell evolution of @xmath45 shell nuclei .",
