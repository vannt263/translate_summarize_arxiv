    "<S> , the efficiency at maximum power decreases with increasing the heat conductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> j. phys . a : math . theor . </S>",
    "<S> 41 , 312003 ( 2008 )    as is well known , the carnot efficiency @xmath3 gives the upper bound for heat engines working between two thermal baths at temperatures @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the engines at the carnot efficiency can not produce output power because the carnot cycle requires an infinitely slow process . </S>",
    "<S> the cycle should be speeded up to obtain a finite power . </S>",
    "<S> curzon and ahlborn @xcite derived the efficiency , @xmath8 , at maximum power for macroscopic heat engines within the framework of finite - time thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the same expression was also obtained from linear irreversible thermodynamics for perfectly coupled systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that the efficiency at maximum power might be different from @xmath9 for imperfectly coupled systems @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite , schmiedl and </S>",
    "<S> seifert investigated cyclic brownian heat engines working in a time - dependent harmonic potential and obtained the efficiency at maximum power , @xmath5 , within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics @xcite .    to illustrate the second law of thermodynamics </S>",
    "<S> , feynman introduced an imaginary microscopic ratchet device in his famous lectures @xcite . following feynman s spirit , </S>",
    "<S> many models were put forward , such as on - off ratchets @xcite , fluctuating potential ratchets @xcite , temperature ratchets @xcite , chiral ratchets @xcite , and so on , which have potential applications in biological motors . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is significant to investigate the efficiency and power of these ratchets . </S>",
    "<S> feynman s ratchet , as a parental model , attracts researchers interests @xcite in the nature of things . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the efficiency at maximum power of feynman s ratchet was obtained by optimizing the external load for given internal parameter in refs.@xcite-@xcite . however , there is still lack of a result by optimizing both the internal parameter and the external load of the ratchet device . </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper , we will analytically derive this result .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider feynman s ratchet device as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a ratchet , a paw and spring , vanes , two thermal baths at temperatures @xmath7 , an axle and wheel , and a load . for simplicity , we assume that the axle and wheel is a rigid and frictionless thermal insulator .        </S>",
    "<S> now we follow feynman s discussion @xcite . in one - step forward motion , we must borrow an energy @xmath10 to overcome the elastic energy of spring and then lift the pawl . </S>",
    "<S> assume that the wheel rotates an angle @xmath11 per step and the load induces a torque @xmath12 , thus we also need an additional energy @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> then the total energy that we have to borrow is @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we can borrow it from the hot thermal bath in the form of heat . </S>",
    "<S> the rate to get this energy is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant with dimension s@xmath17 , and the boltzmann factor is taken to 1 . in this process , the ratchet absorbs heat @xmath14 from the hot thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> a part of this heat is transduced into work @xmath13 , and the other is transferred as heat @xmath10 to the cold thermal bath through the interaction between the ratchet and the paw .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider one - step backward motion . to make the wheel backwards </S>",
    "<S> , we have to accumulate the energy @xmath10 to lift the pawl high enough so that the ratchet can slip . here the rate to get this energy is @xmath18 in the backward process , the load does work @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this energy and the accumulated energy @xmath10 are returned to the hot thermal bath in the form of heat .    in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> , the net work done on the load by the system may be expressed as @xmath20 the net heat absorbed from the hot thermal bath via the potential energy @xcite may be expressed as : @xmath21 since the ratchet contacts simultaneously with two thermal baths at different temperatures , there may exist a heat conduction from the hot thermal bath to the cold one via the kinetic energy @xcite . in time interval @xmath19 , it can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the heat conductivity due to the heat exchange between the ratchet and the paw via kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis by parrondo and espaol suggests that @xmath23 is inversely proportional to the masses of ratchet and paw @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider an perfect ratchet device in which the masses of ratchet and paw are infinitely large relative to the gas molecules full in both thermal baths . in this case , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> thus the efficiency can be defined as @xmath25 the power is defined as @xmath26.\\label{power1}\\ ] ] we find that @xmath27 depends on the internal parameter @xmath10 and the external load @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to tune the external load @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath10 can also be adjusted by changing the strength of the spring . </S>",
    "<S> we can optimize both @xmath10 and @xmath12 to achieve the maximum power . before doing that , we introduce two dimensionless parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> . equations ( [ efficd ] ) and ( [ power1 ] ) are then respectively transformed into @xmath30 and @xmath31.\\label{powerdm}\\ ] ] maximizing @xmath27 with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 the solution to the above equation is @xmath35    substituting equation ( [ optpare ] ) into equation ( [ efficdm ] ) , we derive the efficiency at maximum power @xmath36 this is the main result in the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> it is not hard to prove @xmath37 through simple analysis . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , substituting equation ( [ optpare ] ) into equation ( [ powerdm ] ) , we obtain the maximum power @xmath38    now we compare the present result with two typical values @xmath9 and @xmath6 at various temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows the relation between the efficiency at maximum power and the relative temperature difference , @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the present result ( solid line ) is slightly higher than the value @xmath40 obtained by curzon and ahlborn ( dash line ) for macroscopic heat engines , and than the result @xmath41 obtained by schmiedl and seifert ( dot line ) for stochastic heat engines at small relative temperature difference ( for example , @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the evident deviation between the present result and @xmath6 appears merely for @xmath43 .        </S>",
    "<S> now we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath6 at small relative temperature difference . </S>",
    "<S> expanding them up to the third order term of @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 these results deviate from each other at the third order term of relative temperature difference , which suggests that a universal efficiency at maximum power , @xmath48 , should exist at small relative temperature difference .    up to now , </S>",
    "<S> we have only discussed the ideal case that the masses of ratchet and paw are infinitely large relative to the gas molecules full in both thermal baths such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are vanishing . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the masses are finite and the ratchet device is imperfect , so @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non - vanishing . in this case , the net heat absorbed from the hot thermal bath is @xcite : @xmath49\\delta t.\\label{heat11}\\ ] ] correspondingly , the efficiency is modified as @xmath50^{-1}},\\label{efficdmrv}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the reduced heat conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the power @xmath27 is independent of the heat conductivity @xmath23 , so equations ( [ powerdm])-([optpare ] ) and ( [ maxpower1 ] ) are unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> substituting equation ( [ optpare ] ) into ( [ efficdmrv ] ) , we obtain the efficiency at maximum power @xmath52 it is obvious that @xmath53 because @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency at maximum power depends on the reduced heat conductivity @xmath55 . from figure  [ fig3 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we see that it decreases with increasing the reduced heat conductivity .        in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the efficiency at maximal power of feynman s ratchet as a heat engine by optimizing both the internal parameter and the external load . </S>",
    "<S> we have analytically derived the efficiency at maximum power , equation ( [ effmaxp ] ) , for perfect ratchet device , which is slightly higher than the value obtained by curzon and ahlborn . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency at maximum power for the imperfect ratchet device , equation ( [ effmaxprv ] ) , decreases with increasing the reduced heat conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the present result for perfect ratchet device deviates from the value obtained by schmiedl and seifert merely at large relative temperature difference .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have to list a few open problems which should be addressed in the future work . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> what is the underlying reason for the deviation between @xmath0 and @xmath6 at large temperature difference ? </S>",
    "<S> a possible conjecture is that there might not exist a universal formula at large relative temperature difference . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) zhang _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ held a different viewpoint on @xmath23 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they argued that @xmath56 , which is independent of the masses of ratchet and paw . by adopting their argument </S>",
    "<S> , one can derive the efficiency at maximum power to be @xmath57 $ ] which is much smaller than @xmath9 , @xmath6 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 . whether @xmath23 does indeed depend on the rates @xmath60 and @xmath61 ? </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) allahverdyan _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ investigated a class of quantum heat engines consisting of two subsystems interacting with a work - source and coupled to two separate baths at different temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they also found that the efficiency at maximum power of these quantum heat engines was slightly larger than @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> is there any relation between their result and ours ?    </S>",
