    "the calculation of hadronic excitation energies is an important area of activity for lattice",
    ". hadrons containing both heavy and light quarks present an interesting challenge since one has to deal with quarks at many different mass scales .",
    "recently results for radial excitations of heavy - light hadrons were reviewed @xcite and it was found that in the meson sector there was reasonably good agreement between lattice qcd simulations , quark models and available ( but still incomplete ) experimental data . however , for baryons containing a single charm or bottom quark there seems to be a puzzle .",
    "the few results obtained for radial excitations of s - wave singly heavy baryons are consistently larger than quark model values .",
    "whereas the quark model suggests that excitation energies of heavy - light baryons should be smaller than that of heavy - light mesons the lattice results reviewed in @xcite do not show this qualitative feature .",
    "unfortunately , experiment is unlikely to settle this issue any time soon .",
    "in addition to predicting that baryonic excitations are smaller than mesonic ones , quark models also predict that the lowest lying radial excitation of a doubly heavy baryon should be significantly smaller than of a singly heavy baryon ( see , for example , fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the different excitation modes at play @xcite . in a singly heavy baryon",
    "the lowest lying excitation is due to the motion of the heavy quark relative to the diquark system formed by the light quarks . in a doubly heavy baryon",
    "it is the excitation of the heavy quark pair that is important .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced for bottom baryons .",
    "it is natural to ask if the features of the spectrum which these quark model mechanisms predict are reproduced in a lattice qcd simulation .",
    "this is the theme of the present paper .    in this work we focus on the lattice simulation of spin @xmath3 baryons @xmath0 and @xmath4",
    "since the valence quark content of these baryons consists only of strange and bottom the values of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 sea quark masses are of secondary importance .",
    "for our simulation the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks are near physical corresponding to a pion mass of @xmath7 so @xmath8 mass extrapolation is not carried out . secondly , with strange quark valence",
    "content statistical fluctuations are considerably smaller than what would have been possible if @xmath8 valence quarks would have been used .",

    "[ sec:1 ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the analysis method and results are presented .",

    "the @xmath2 dynamical flavour gauge field configurations used in this work were generated by the pacs - cs collaboration @xcite on a @xmath9 lattice using the iwasaki action ( @xmath10 ) for the gauge field and the clover - wilson action for the fermions .",
    "the strange quark hopping parameter used here was @xmath11 which is slightly different than that used by the pacs - cs collaboration and is in line with the value determined from earlier work on the @xmath12 spectrum @xcite .",
    "the strange quark clover coefficient was @xmath13 .",
    "the gauge field ensemble had 198 configurations .",
    "for this ensemble pacs - cs determined a lattice spacing of @xmath14 .",
    "the bottom quark was described using tadpole - improved lattice nrqcd @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is the same as used in previous calculation of bottom baryon masses and may be found in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite terms up to order @xmath15 were retained in the nonrelativistic expansion .",
    "the @xmath16-quark bare mass was @xmath17 as determined in ref .",
    "@xcite from tuning to s - wave bottomonium .",
    "the average link in landau gauge , estimated to be @xmath18 , was used for tadpole improvement and the stability parameter @xmath19 appearing in the nrqcd hamiltionian was taken to be 4 . as a check of the lattice nrqcd setup the @xmath20 - @xmath21 mass difference was calculated with the result @xmath22 in excellent agreement with the experimental value @xmath23 obtained using the pdg @xcite value for the @xmath20 mass and the belle result @xcite for @xmath21 .",

    "the simplest operator that one can construct of the form ( [ eq : bary ] ) has all quark fields at the same space - time point .",
    "however to disentangle ground and excited state contributions to correlation functions it is advantageous to use a variety of spatially smeared operators which will lead to different admixtures of states in the correlators .",
    "successful phenomenological descriptions of baryons are often made using a quark - diquark model which implies strong spatial correlations among the constituents .",
    "ideally , we would like to construct lattice baryon operators incorporating quark - quark correlations .",
    "however a usable scheme for doing this is not available so here independent spatial smearing of the quark fields is carried out .",
    "quark fields are smeared according to @xmath27 where f is a gauge field independent profile function .",
    "since this is not gauge covariant a gauge fixing to coulomb gauge is carried out on the gauge field links prior to use . a choice for the profile @xmath28 which has been used successfully in nrqcd applications is motivated by the shape of wavefunctions for the coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "in this work we use mostly a smearing function of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the shortest distance between @xmath31 and @xmath32 in a periodic box .",
    "this will be referred to as ground state smearing .",
    "an excited state smearing function @xmath33 was also considered . since",

    "it is natural to ask if this work and other the lattice calculations done to date @xcite indicate an irreconcilable difference with quark models for heavy - light baryon spectroscopy .",
    "it is probably premature to conclude this as there are still systematic effects that have not been studied systematically .",
    "lattice calculations have been done in a variety of lattice setups for up and down quark masses , including the present work where there are no valance u , d quarks and the sea u , d quark masses are near physical .",
    "since the qualitative comparison of lattice simulations with quark models is the same for all setups light quark mass extrapolation may not be a primary issue .",
    "perhaps more significantly no continuum extrapolation was carried out in the lattice calculations mentioned above .",
    "it is tempting to point to this systematic as the source of all discrepancies .",

    "for excited states , it was difficult to see the finite volume effect due to large statistical fluctuations .",
    "what we propose here is that differences seen between present lattice simulations and quark models for radial excitation energies may at the same time be pointing to the resolution of the issue .",
    "the lattice qcd discrepancy with quark models is seen to be larger for singly heavy baryons than for doubly heavy baryons .",
    "since it is expected that singly heavy baryons are more strongly affected by finite volume effects this may be indicating the need for baryon simulations in larger spatial volumes .",
    "masses for spin @xmath108 @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons were calculated using lattice qcd . as well , the energies of lowest lying radial excitations were computed . at present , there is no experimental information about radial excitations in heavy - light baryons so comparison is made to quark models .",
    "quark models have the interesting feature that the radial excitation energies in doubly - heavy baryons are significantly smaller than for singly - heavy baryons .",
