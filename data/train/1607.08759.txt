    "nearly ten years ago the surprising observation of  slow \" quantum oscillations in under - doped oxygen - ordered yba@xmath3cu@xmath9o@xmath10 ( ybco ) crystals  @xcite at high magnetic fields and then in the intrinsically under - doped stoichiometric compound yba@xmath3cu@xmath11o@xmath12  @xcite , opened up new avenues in the study of high temperature superconductors .",
    "more recently , the presence of incommensurate charge density waves ( cdws ) at temperatures ( @xmath5 ) well above the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath13 ) has been established by a number of experiments , nmr  @xcite , resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs )  @xcite and high energy x - ray diffraction  @xcite both in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , and other underdoped cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the wave vector of the cdw is directed along the copper - oxygen bonds and that it decreases slightly with increased hole doping  @xcite .",
    "angle resolved photoemission  ( arpes ) studies  @xcite of underdoped bismuth and lanthanum - based cuprates give evidence for fermi arcs .",
    "in particular comin et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that the cdw wave vector gives rise to small electron pockets  @xcite because it connects the tips of different fermi arcs .",
    "this is appealing because it provides a direct link between the presence of the pseudogap and cdw formation .",
    "namely the pseudogap is finite except in regions near the diagonals of the brillouin zone ( the nodal regions in the @xmath14-wave superconducting state ) .",
    "it therefore breaks the large fermi surface , which has been observed directly via quantum oscillation studies of an overdoped cuprate  @xcite , into disconnected arcs .",
    "nmr measurements of underdoped ybco give evidence for long range static charge order in high fields , without any sign of spin - order for @xmath15 0.5  @xcite while nmr measurements of quadrupolar frequency broadening suggest that the cdw order is also static at low fields  @xcite .",
    "disorder may be important in low fields  @xcite and on the basis of earlier work on nbse@xmath3 , it has been suggested that static cdws nucleate around defects  @xcite .",
    "but somewhat against this , 2@xmath16 zn doping strongly suppresses the cdw intensity in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath17  @xcite .",
    "ultrasonic measurements at high - fields  @xcite have also revealed a transition to a long - range charge ordered state , with further evidence being provided by two recent structural studies  @xcite .",
    "the ionic displacements associated with the cdw in ud67 ybco ( @xmath13=67  k ) have recently been calculated  @xcite .",
    "they reveal a complicated pattern involving shear displacements perpendicular to the cuo@xmath3 layers that breaks the mirror symmetry of the bi - layers . for this ud67 crystal chang et al .",
    "@xcite , measured the intensity of cdw diffraction peaks as a function of temperature both at zero and finite magnetic fields . they observed a gradual increase in intensity below an onset temperature @xmath18135  k and then , at zero field , a decrease below @xmath13 .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath19 suggested competition between the two types of order with the cdw signal being restored when superconductivity was suppressed by a large magnetic field .",
    "however , the origin of the cdw ordering vector , the driving force for cdw order and the size of any cdw gap in the electronic density of states ( dos ) are still unknown .",
    "one fundamental thermodynamic property that could contribute towards understanding these questions is the @xmath5-dependent static magnetic susceptibility @xmath20 above @xmath13 .",
    "here we report measurements of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with magnetic field @xmath23 parallel and perpendicular to the crystalline @xmath24-axis for relatively large twinned single crystals of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 at 7 values of the oxygen content @xmath4 .",
    "in other cdw materials such as k@xmath25moo@xmath9  @xcite the opening of the cdw gap causes a clear reduction in @xmath20 , and an increase in @xmath26 for @xmath27 . using a special method of analysis",
    ", that will also be useful in the future for studies of detwinned yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals and other underdoped cuprates , we show that for most , but not all , values of @xmath4 , the onset of the cdw has a small but detectable effect on @xmath28 . from our viewpoint",
    "the physical reason for its small size is that as mentioned before  @xcite the electronic entropy at @xmath29 has already been strongly suppressed because of the pseudogap . or equivalently there are only short fermi arcs rather than a large fermi surface so the electronic dos has already been heavily reduced by the pseudogap . in particular for our ud68 crystal with @xmath13 = 67.9  k we compare our results with expectations from the @xmath5-dependent cdw intensity measured for ud67  @xcite , bearing in mind that the size of the cdw gap will be proportional to the square root of the intensity  @xcite .    while performing this analysis we again found the surprising result , briefly mentioned previously  @xcite , that the small isotropic curie ( @xmath30 ) terms in @xmath20 disappear quite abruptly above 200  k. since then , biscaras et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that fast cooling of polycrystalline yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 from 400  k to below 300  k , increases @xmath31 and have suggested that cu@xmath32 spins at the chain ends give a significant contribution to @xmath31 , so that the longer chains in slowly cooled samples give a smaller curie term .",
    "we discuss this picture and an alternative one in which the spins arise from localized states in the pseudogap  @xcite . finally using model parameters obtained by fitting our @xmath28 data for ud68",
    ", we calculate the changes in electronic entropy , heat capacity and the free energy density caused by the cdw .",
    "we discuss the importance of making high resolution heat capacity measurements of a detwinned ud67 crystal in the future , preferably combined with structural and magnetic susceptibility studies on exactly the same sample . from the present work we estimate the product of the free energy density and the cdw coherence volume in ud68 showing it to be @xmath33 at 100  k and @xmath34 at 80  k. these numbers are lower limits and could be 2 or 3 times larger if the effect of the pseudogap contribution is handled differently .",

    "this is in contrast to our earlier study  @xcite , where squid measurements for the samples in fig .  1 of ref .  ,",

    "they have been annealed at room temperature for extremely long periods , during which weight changes were less than 0.01 mg , but they were not detwinned .",
    "this weight change limit corresponds to an uncertainty in @xmath4 ranging from 0.002 for a 234 mg crystal to 0.005 for an 83 mg one .",

    "furthermore , structural studies on rapidly quenched crystals still show cdw effects although their amplitude is reduced  @xcite .",

    "[ y123intro](b ) .",
    "an important caveat is raised later , but if we do make the simple assumption  @xcite that each chain end gives rise to one spin @xmath51 = 1/2 , and assume that a localized spin always separates two chain segments , then the number of spins is equal to the number of chain segments . hence the values of @xmath31 in fig .",

    "the wilson ratio for the cuprates is similar to that expected for weakly interacting fermions  @xcite .",
    "therefore comparable values for the electronic free energy would be obtained using a more realistic band structure and different arc lengths , because of the general relation between the measured magnetic susceptibility and the electronic heat capacity .",
    "estimates of the size of the cdw gap suggest that there are unlikely to be significant cdw - induced changes in transport properties at 100  k at low magnetic fields , i.e. the hall coefficient would be hole - rather than electron - like in agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",

    "we have also put forward a qualitative explanation for the enhancement of the cdw by a large magnetic field .",
    "this involves a pile up of charge at the tips of the fermi arcs that is induced by the lorentz force .",
