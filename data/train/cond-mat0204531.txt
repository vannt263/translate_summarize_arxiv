    "when a drop of liquid spreads on a solid surface , the _ contact line _ , which is the common borderline between the solid , the liquid , and the corresponding equilibrium vapor , undergoes a rather complex dynamical behavior .",
    "this dynamics is determined by a subtle competition between the mutual interfacial energetics of the three phases , dissipation and hydrodynamic flows in the liquid , and the geometrical or chemical irregularities of the solid surface @xcite .    for a partially wetting fluid on sufficiently smooth substrates , a contact line at equilibrium",
    "has a well defined contact - angle @xmath0 that is determined by the solid - vapor @xmath1 and the solid - liquid @xmath2 interfacial energies , and the liquid surface tension @xmath3 through young s relation : @xmath4 . for a moving contact line , however , the value of the so - called dynamic contact - angle @xmath5 changes as a function of velocity : @xmath6 for an advancing contact line and @xmath7 for a receding one",
    "this is because the unbalanced interfacial force @xmath8 now has to be balanced with a frictional force in a steady state situation .",
    "the dissipation in the moving contact line , which is responsible for the friction , can be either of _ local _ origin , for example due to microscopic jumps of single molecules ( from the liquid into the vapor ) in the immediate vicinity of the contact line @xcite , or due to viscous _",
    "losses inside the moving liquid wedge @xcite .    for a contact line that is receding at a velocity @xmath9",
    ", it has been shown by de gennes @xcite that a steady state is achieved in which the liquid will partially wet the plate with a nonvanishing dynamic contact - angle @xmath5 only for velocities less than a certain critical value .",
    "the dynamic contact - angle decreases with increasing @xmath9 , until at the critical velocity the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which a macroscopic landau  levich liquid film @xcite , formally corresponding to a vanishing @xmath5 , will remain on the plate .",
    "one can think of the dynamic contact - angle as the order parameter characterizing this _ coating transition _ , in analogy with equilibrium phase transitions , while velocity is playing the role of the tuning parameter .",
    "elaborating further on this analogy then seems to suggest that the nature of the coating transition depends crucially on the dominant dissipation mechanism : in the local picture @xmath5 vanishes continuously as @xmath9 approaches the critical velocity , which makes it look like a _ second order _ phase transition , while on the contrary , in the hydrodynamic picture a jump is predicted in @xmath5 from @xmath10 to zero at the transition , which is the signature of a _ first order _ phase transition @xcite .",
    "another notable feature of contact lines , which is responsible for their novel dynamics , is their anomalous long - ranged elasticity @xcite . for length scales below the capillary length ( which is of the order of 3 mm for water at room temperature ) , a contact line deformation of wavevector",
    "@xmath11 will distort the surface of the liquid over a distance @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that the surface deforms instantaneously in response to the contact line , the elastic energy cost for the deformation can be calculated from the surface tension energy stored in the distorted area , and is thus proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "the anomalous elasticity leads to interesting equilibrium dynamics , corresponding to when the contact line is perturbed from its static position , as studied by de gennes @xcite . balancing the rate of interfacial energy change and the dissipation , which he assumed for small contact - angles",
    "is dominated by the hydrodynamic dissipation in the liquid nearby the contact line , he finds that each deformation mode relaxes to equilibrium with a characteristic ( inverse ) decay time @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a characteristic _ relaxation velocity _ @xcite .",
    "the relaxation is thus characterized by a dynamic exponent @xmath16 , defined via @xmath17 , which is equal to 1 .",
    "the linear dispersion relation implies that a deformation in the contact line will _ decay _ and _ propagate _ at a constant velocity , as opposed to systems with normal line tension elasticity , where the decay and the propagation are governed by diffusion .",
    "this behavior has been observed , and the linear dispersion relation has been precisely tested , in a recent experiment by ondarcuhu and veyssie @xcite .    in reality , the presence of defects and heterogeneities in the substrate , which could be due to ( surface ) roughness or chemical contamination , further complicates the dynamics of a contact line @xcite . in the presence of such heterogeneities ,",
    "a contact line at equilibrium becomes _ rough _ , because it tries to locally deform so as to find the path with optimal _ pinning _ energy @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of a perfect solid surface , where the contact line is _",
    "flat_. the roughness can be characterized as a scaling law that relates the statistical width @xmath18 of the contact line to its length @xmath19 , via @xmath20 .",
    "the so - called roughness exponent @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 for a contact line at equilibrium on a surface with short - range correlated disorder @xcite .",
    "since the contact line is pinned by the defects , a nonzero ( critical ) force is necessary to set it to motion , through a _ depinning _",
    "transition @xcite .",
    "for a contact line at the depinning threshold , a roughness exponent about @xmath23 has been predicted theoretically from two - loop field theoretical renormalization group calculations @xcite , and numerical simulations @xcite , which seems to disagree with the experimental finding of @xmath24 for both liquid helium on a cesium substrate @xcite and water on glass experiments @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that there may be numerous metastable states for the contact line due to the random disorder , leading to hysteresis in the contact - angle @xcite .",
    "-2.5truecm    7.5 cm    .3truecm    here we study the _ nonequilibrium _ dynamics of the deformations of a moving contact line on a disordered substrate @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is governed by a balance between three different forces : ( i ) the interfacial force , ( ii ) the frictional force which can stem from either local or hydrodynamic dissipation processes , and ( iii ) a random force caused by the disorder .",
    "we find that the relaxation spectrum of a moving contact line is the same as the equilibrium case , but the characteristic relaxation velocity depends on @xmath9 : it decreases with @xmath9 until at the critical velocity corresponding to the coating transition it vanishes identically . the progressively slow relaxation of a distorted contact line near the coating transition is in agreement with a nucleation picture of the phase transition ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xi ] ) .",
    "we find that coating transition can be actually understood in terms of a _ roughening transition _ of the contact line on the disordered substrate .",
    "since linear relaxation becomes infinitely slow in the vicinity of the coating transition , the dominant relaxation is thus governed by nonlinear terms in the dynamical equation , and the dynamical phase transition can thus be properly accounted for only by using systematic renormalization group ( rg ) calculations .",
    "we find that disorder favors the coating transition , in the sense that the onset of leaving a landau  levich film for a random substrate with strength @xmath25 takes place at a dynamic contact - angle @xmath26 for local dissipation , and @xmath27 for hydrodynamic dissipation , to the leading order .",
    "( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are numerical constants to be defined below . ) the value of the roughness exponent at the transition is found to determine the order of the transition .",
    "although we find that this exponent acquires non - universal values , it appears that the predicted nature of the phase transition from the rg calculation is in agreement with the mean - field results , i.e. second order for local case and first order for hydrodynamic case , for sufficiently weak disorder .    for a sufficiently slowly moving contact line , we find that a _ pinning transition _ takes place , which is the reverse of the depinning transition , and that it can also be understood as a roughening transition .",
    "we obtain the phase boundary for this transition corresponding to the advancing and receding contact angles at the onset of pinning as @xmath30 for the local case , and @xmath31 for the hydrodynamic case , to the leading order , which is in agreement with a previous prediction by robbins and joanny @xcite .",
    "( @xmath32 and @xmath33 are numerical constants to be defined below . )",
    "we further find that the roughness exponent at the pinning threshold is also non - universal .",
    "we combine our results for the coating transition and the pinning transition , and propose a phase diagram for contact lines with local dissipation as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd - local ] , and a corresponding one for contact lines with hydrodynamic dissipation as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd - hydro ] . in particular , we find that the phase boundaries corresponding to the coating transition and the pinning transition meet at a junction point @xmath34 , and suggest that for sufficiently strong disorder a receding contact line will leave a landau  levich film immediately after depinning .",
