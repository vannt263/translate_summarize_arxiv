    "arguably one of the most exciting aspects of galaxy bulges are the monstrous black holes which reside in their cores , sometimes lurking quietly , other times beaming out their existence to the universe .",
    "not only are they the dominant species on the mass spectrum of individual objects , but they play host to such a range of extremely unusual phenomenon that they appeal to people of all ages and professions .    for extragalactic astronomers , one curious aspect is the apparent coupling between the mass of the black hole , @xmath0 , and the host galaxy bulge or spheroid , @xmath1 , within which it resides . the importance of this is because it suggests that the growth of the two is intimately intertwined , and unravelling this connection will provide insight into their co - evolution . while the @xmath0@xmath1 relation may arise from black hole feedback processes such that the black hole regulates the growth of the surrounding spheroid ( a remarkable feat given the factor of a billion difference in physical size ) , correlations between both the central radial concentration of stars and the central stellar density of the spheroid with @xmath1 might be telling us that it is instead the spheroid mass which ( indirectly ) dictates the black hole mass through these relations .",
    "this article starts by providing a background briefing to the development of ideas ( since einstein introduced his theories of relativity ) which have led to our current understanding of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei ( section  [ sec_history ] ) , and the eventual observational proof which ruled out alternative astrophysical suggestions for the dark mass concentrations identified there ( section  [ sec_firm ] ) .",
    "some effort has been made to reference key papers and give credit to the original developers of ideas and solutions , of whom many have been poorly cited in the literature to date .",
    "not surprisingly , many reviews have been written about supermassive black holes , and far more than the author was aware when approached to write this review .",
    "enjoyable reports are provided by kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) , longair ( 1996 and 2006 ) which includes a well - written historical perspective , and an impressively extensive overview of many sub - topics can be found in ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) which remain highly relevant today . in it , they too provide an historical account of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , detail the many methods used to measure the masses of black holes today , and compare the demographics of black holes in distant quasars with local galaxies .",
    "it is however their section  9 , pertaining to the scaling relations between the masses of black holes and the properties of their host galaxy that is the main focus of this article . for references to other aspects of massive black holes , over the past decade or so",
    "the following astrophysical reviews have focussed on : sagittarius a@xmath2 ( alexander 2005 ; genzel et al .",
    "2010 ) ; intermediate mass black holes ( miller & colbert 2004 ; van der marel 2004 ) ; massive black hole binaries ( merritt & milosavljevi 2005 ) ; agn activity and feedback ( brandt & hasinger 2005 ; ho 2008 ; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) , including hot accretion flows ( yuan & narayan 2014 ) and cold accretion flows ( kato 2008 ; abramowicz & fragile 2013 ) ; connections with distant agn ( shankar 2009a ) ; redshifted fluorescent iron lines ( reynolds & nowak 2003 ; miller 2007 ) ; gravitational radiation ( berti et al .  2009 , see also amaro - seoane et al .",
    "2012 ) ; black hole spin ( gammie et al .  2004",
    "; reynolds 2013 ) ; black hole seeds ( volonteri 2010 , see also koushiappas et al .",
    "2004 ) ; and a healthy mix of various topics ( e.g.  kormendy & ho 2013 ; genzel 2014 ) as in ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) .",
    "as noted by ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) , in 2004 direct black hole mass measurements were known for 30 galaxies , plus another 8 galaxies for which the dynamical models might be in error .",
    "recently , savorgnan & graham ( 2014 ) , see also kormendy & ho ( 2013 ) , tabulate 89 galaxies with reliably measured black hole masses . not only has the sample size therefore tripled over the past decade , but new scaling relations have been uncovered and old relations have been revised  and dramatically so as we shall see in the case of the @xmath3@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath4 relations ( section  [ sec_m - m ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath5 relation , involving the velocity dispersion of the galactic host , is reviewed in section  [ sec_m - sigma ] and the controversial issue of its slope addressed .",
    "the apparent substructure in the @xmath0@xmath5 diagram , reported in 2008 due to barred galaxies and/or pseudobulges , is additionally discussed .",
    "having dealt in some detail with the two most commonly cited black hole scaling relations in sections  [ sec_m - m ] and [ sec_m - sigma ] , the assortment of related relations are presented .",
    "while not as popular in the literature , it may be one of these relations which provides the fundamental , or at least an important , link between the black hole mass and its host galaxy ( an issue raised by alexander & hickox 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , section  [ sec_n ] examines the connection between the black hole mass and the host spheroid s srsic index , i.e.  how radially concentrated the spheroid s stellar distribution is ; this dictates the radial gradient of the gravitational potential .",
    "section  [ sec_mu0 ] describes the expected association between the black hole mass and the central stellar density ( prior to core depletion ) .",
    "section  [ sec_core ] explores the link between the mass of the black hole and the missing stellar mass at the centres of giant spheroids .",
    "the connection between the black holes and the dense star clusters found in the nuclei of many galaxies  some of which may harbour intermediate mass black holes  is presented in section  [ sec_bh - nc ] .",
    "section  [ sec_halo ] discusses the black hole mass relation with the halo ( baryons plus dark matter ) mass , expected to exist for spheroid dominated galaxies , while section  [ sec_pitch ] remarks on the existence of a correlation with the pitch angle of spiral arms in late - type galaxies .",
    "finally , section  [ sec_fun ] considers the possibility that a third parameter may account for some of the scatter in the above bivariate distributions , leading to a more fundamental plane or hypersurface in 3-parameter space involving black hole mass and two galaxy / spheroid parameters .",
    "karl schwarzschild ( 1916 , 1999 ; see also droste 1917 who independently derived the same solution in 1916 ) is widely recognised for having developed the ` schwarzschild metric ' for a spherical or point mass within einstein s ( 1916 ) theory of general relativity , but it was finkelstein ( 1958 , see also kruskal 1960 ) who realised the true nature of what has come to be called the `` event horizon '' bounding these gravitational prisons .",
    "finkelstein eloquently describes this schwarzschild surface as `` a perfect unidirectional membrane : causal influences can cross it but only in one direction '' .",
    "five years later , while working at the university of texas , the new zealand mathematician roy kerr ( 1963 ) formulated the metric for the more realistic _ rotating _ black hole .",
    "interestingly , solutions to this space - time include closed time - like curves which , in theory , allow one to travel backwards in time ( a concept popularised but also questioned by thorne 1994 ) .",
    "kurt gdel ( 1949 ) was actually the first to derive such strange solutions to the equations of general relativity , although it is commonly suspected that all closed time - like curves are just a mathematical artifact , in the same way that the original singularity at the schwarzschild radius was later explained away by a coordinate transformation ( e.g.  eddington 1924 ; georges lematre 1933 ) , leaving just the singularity ( i.e.  black hole ) at the centre . but",
    "even if we are to be denied our time machines , black holes still offer the curious and unsuspecting property of evaporating over time  radiating like a black body  before possibly then exploding ( hawkings 1974 , 1975 ) .    evolving parallel to the above analytical developments , our acceptance of black holes as more than just a mathematical curiosity had additional connections with stellar evolution and dark stars .",
    "as detailed by yakovlev ( 1994 ) , the soviet physicist yakov frenkel ( 1928 ) was the first to derive equations for the energy density and pressure of super - dense stars comprised of a degenerate fermi - gas of electrons of arbitrary relativistic extent .",
    "he is , however , not widely recognised for having done so . also using results from albert einstein s ( 1905 ) theory of special relativity , soviet physicist wilhelm anderson ( 1929 )",
    "was the first to derive a maximum mass for the fermion degenerate stellar model of white dwarf stars , above which the fermi pressure is insufficient to overcome gravity .",
    "it is however the british physicist edmund stoner ( 1929 ) who is somewhat better known for having presented the structure for the mass , radius and density of white dwarf stars composed of non - relativistic electrons . using his uniformly distributed mass density model , stoner ( 1930 ,",
    "see also stoner 1932a , b ) refined his work by formulating how the core becomes relativistic at sufficiently high densities ( as had already been done by frenkel 1928 ) and he too predicted a maximum stable mass ( similar to anderson 1929 ) for earth - sized , white dwarf stars .",
    "but it is chandrasekhar ( 1931a , see also chandrasekhar 1931b ) who is well known for calculating , in a short two - page article using _ polytropic density models _ , that at masses above @xmath60.91 @xmath7 , electron - degenerate white dwarf stars are not stable .",
    "that is , there is a maximum mass ( recognised today as 1.4 @xmath7 ) that white dwarf stars can have .",
    "if more massive than this limit then they must undergo further gravitational compression . soon after ,",
    "soviet physicist lev landau ( 1932 ) correctly identified that the next level of resistance to their gravitational collapse would be met in the form of the denser neutron star ( see also oppenheimer & serber 1938 ; oppenheimer & volkoff 1939 ) .",
    "landau ( 1932 ) and chandrasekhar ( 1932 , 1935 ) predicted that the ultimate fate of an evolved massive star would be to collapse to a singularity of infinite density .",
    "following further work on this idea ( e.g.  baade & zwicky 1934 ; zwicky 1938 ; datt 1938 ) , oppenheimer & snyder ( 1939 ) carefully detailed how overly massive neutron stars are not stable and will collapse into stellar mass black holes .",
    "quite simply , if a star is massive enough and the outward pressure from fusion is over , gravity will win over ( e.g.  arnett 1967 ) .",
    "wheeler ( 1966 ) wrote _ `` in all the physics of the postwar era it is difficult to name any situation more enveloped in paradox than the phenomenon of gravitational collapse''_. then , in the following year ( 1967 ) , more than three decades after the initial prediction of neutron stars , pulsars were discovered , finally signalling the existence of neutron stars ( hewish et al .  1968 ;",
    "pilkington et al .",
    "1968 ; hewish 1970 ) . not surprisingly , this bolstered belief in the existence of stellar mass black holes ( e.g.  penrose 1965 ; vishveshwara 1970 ) , as did ( i ) mathematical proof that a singularity will form if an event horizon has formed ( penrose 1969 ; hawking & penrose 1970 ) , ( ii ) the x - ray pulses from cygnus x-1 ( oda et al .",
    "1971 ; thorne & price 1975 ) , and likely also ( iii ) the pioneering searches by weber ( 1969 , 1970 ) for gravitational radiation coming from even more massive objects at the centre of our galaxy .",
    "as detailed by longair ( 1996 , 2006 , 2010 ) , ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) and collin ( 2006 ) , the notion that the centres of galaxies may contain massive black holes , millions to hundreds of millions times the mass of our sun , stems from the discovery of the great distance to , and thus luminosity of , the quasi - stellar radio source 3c  273 .",
    "the optical counterpart of this radio source was cleverly discovered by hazard , mackey & shimmins ( 1963 ) using the parkes radio telescope and lunar eclipsing .",
    "its redshift was subsequently taken with the palomar observatory s hale telescope and correctly interpreted by schmidt ( 1963 ) , see also oke ( 1963 ) regarding 3c  273 and greenstein & matthews ( 1963a , b ) in the case of 3c  48 ( whose redshift had remained uninterrupted over the preceding couple of years ) .",
    "baade & minkowski ( 1954 ) , ambartsumian ( 1958 ) , woltjer ( 1959 ) , burbidge et al .",
    "( 1959 , 1963 , 1964 ) , lynds & sandage ( 1963 ) and others had already recognised active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to be incredibly energetic phenomena .",
    "radio galaxy 3c  273 and other active galactic nuclei emit vasts amount of energy from a small volume of space ( as indicated by quasar variability on short time scales , smith & hoffleit 1963 ) and were thus thought to be powered from the gravitational potential energy released as matter falls onto a compact massive object ( salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich 1964 ; zeldovich & novikov 1964 ; neeman 1965 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . based upon eddington - limiting arguments at the time , it was immediately realised that the central object has to be massive or else the radiation pressure of the quasar would literally blow the quasar apart .",
    "hoyle et al .",
    "( 1964 ) acknowledged the possibility of `` invisible mass '' perhaps from imploded objects of very large mass .",
    "just two years after the high - redshifts were recorded for the star - like radio sources , sandage ( 1965 ) reported on the high abundance of radio - quiet quasars , referring to them as a `` major new constituent of the universe '' .",
    "what he had revealed was that in addition to the radio - loud quasars , the universe was teeming with many more quasars . encapsulating the ideas of recent years , lynden - bell ( 1969 ) and lynden - bell & ress ( 1971 ) suggested that a massive black hole resides at the cores of many galaxies ( see also wolfe & burbidge 1970 ) , and that the infall of orbital matter builds an accretion disc ( e.g.  thorne 1974 ) which heats up due to friction . for a rapidly spinning black hole ,",
    "this process can liberate a substantial fraction ( up to 0.42 for a maximally spinning black hole ) of the infalling matter s rest mass energy ( bardeen & wagoner 1969 ; bardeen 1970 ) .",
    "further support for the presence of massive black holes were the linear radio features emanating from the nuclei of galaxies  which were likely emitted from a stable gyroscope such as a spinning black hole  and the superluminal speed of these radio jets ( e.g.  cohen et al .  1971 ; whitney et al .  1971 ) .",
    "the moniker `` black hole '' was used by ann ewing ( 1964 ) just a year after the redshift of 3c  273 was announced .",
    "she reportedly heard it at a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ) , and it was later seen used in a scientific paper by john wheeler ( 1968 ) . by 1970",
    "the label appears as a familiar term in the literature .",
    "it had , at times , previously been used to describe dusty dark patches in our own galaxy ( e.g.  barnard 1897 ; campbell 1917 ) .",
    "however it became the popular replacement for what the soviet physicists ( e.g.  zeldovich 1964 ) called a frozen star , and western physicists called a collapsed star or a `` collapsar '' ( e.g.  cameron 1971 ) .",
    "the term `` singularity '' had also been , and still is , regularly used by the mathematicians to indicate where any quantity in the field equations becomes infinite .    despite its strangely endearing name ,",
    "the phrase `` black hole '' is often noted to be somewhat unfortunate in that it implies a _ hole _ in space through which matter may fall through .",
    "the idea of an actual singularity  a point of infinite density which arises out of classical physics after division by 0  is also not popular and considered rather old - school .",
    "while a planck - sized mote may be a better description , what actually exists near the centre of a black hole s event horizon is hotly debated .",
    "mathematically - inclined readers who are interested in what a black hole may be like , might enjoy reading about the fuzzball picture from string theory ( t hooft 1980 ; mathur 2005 , and associated references ) , or descriptions of black holes in quantum gravity theories such as spin foam networks ( e.g.  penrose 1971a , b ; penrose & rindler 1986 ; rovelli 1998 ; domagala & lewandowski 2004 ; perez 2004 ) or loop quantum gravity ( e.g.  ashtekar & bojowald 2005 ; hayward 2006 ) .",
    "acceptance of the idea that supermassive black holes reside at the centres of galaxies was not as straight forward as suggested above . during the 1960s and 1970s the agn community battled it out amongst themselves before ( largely ) embracing the idea that black holes must be required to power the quasar engines of galaxies .",
    "building on sandage ( 1965 ) , soltan ( 1982 ) reasoned that there had to be a lot of mass locked up today in massive black holes because of all the past quasar activity , and rees ( 1984 ) advocated further for the preponderance of massive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "then during the 1980s and early 1990s it was primarily the inactive - galaxy community , as opposed to the agn - community , who remained skeptical until two key papers in 1995 ( discussed shortly ) .    among the pioneering observational papers for the presence of a massive black hole in individual , nearby , non - agn galaxies , sanders & lowinger ( 1972 ) calculated that the milky way houses a @xmath8 black hole and sargent et al .",
    "( 1978 ) concluded that a @xmath9 black hole very probably exists in m87 ( see also lynden - bell 1969 who predicted a @xmath10 black hole for the milky way , and a @xmath11 black hole in m87 , i.e.  an order of magnitude higher ) .",
    "although these works had revealed that very high masses in small volumes were required at the centres of these galaxies ( see also dressler 1984 and tonry 1984 in the case of m31 and m32 , respectively ) , it took some years before the observations / measurements improved and alternatives such as a dense cloud of stellar mass black holes or neutron stars could be ruled out .",
    "the three following observational works turned the tide of opinion among the remaining naysayers who demanded further proof before accepting the existence of what is indeed an extreme astrophysical object : the supermassive black hole .",
    "\\1 ) before an object crosses within a black hole s event horizon , any radiation it emits away from the black hole will be gravitationally redshifted , the extent of which depending on how close the object is to the event horizon .",
    "such a tell - tale signature of redshifting was reported on 22 june 1995 by tanaka et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who detected the highly broadened , ionised iron k@xmath12 line ( 6.4 kev ) from the galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "this highly asymmetric , predominantly redshifted , x - ray emission line had a width corresponding to roughly one - third of the speed of light , and was thought to have been emitted at just 3 to 10 schwarzschild radii from the black hole . such relativistic broadening has since been shown to be commonplace ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) , thanks to the enhanced sensitivity and spectral resolution of the japanese asca x - ray satellite ( tanaka et al .",
    "2 ) additional convincing evidence for the reality of massive black holes had came from the very high mass density required to explain the central object in the seyfert galaxy ngc  4258 ( m106 ) . using the very long baseline array in new mexico , miyoshi et al .  ( 1995 ) showed that the h@xmath13o maser emission from this galaxy originates from a thin , rotating nuclear gas disc / annulus displaying a clear keplerian rotation curve and requiring a mass of @xmath14 within a size of just 0.13 parsec mpc . ]",

    "1995a , b ) . in their january 12 paper , miyoshi et al .  ( 1995 ) note that the short collisional timescale ( @xmath15 years ) for a swarm of solar mass dark stars with such density ( @xmath16 pc@xmath17 inside of the inner 4.1 milliarcseconds ) implies that such a hypothetical star cluster could not survive ( see also maoz 1995 , 1998 ) ; a single supermassive black hole is the only viable candidate .",
    "a second example of extreme mass density ( @xmath18 pc@xmath17 ) has since been shown in the circinus galaxy by greenhill et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "\\3 ) several years later , high spatial resolution measurements of stellar orbits around the central object in our own milky way galaxy also eventually ruled out the possibility that it could be a swarm of neutron stars or stellar mass black holes , with the high density favouring the existence of a massive black hole ( schdel et al .",

    " whose radius is defined as @xmath19 ( e.g.  peebles 1972 ; frank & rees 1976 ) where @xmath20 is roughly the host spheroid s velocity dispersion immediately beyond @xmath21  one expects to find keplerian dynamics which are dominated by the black hole .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the stars ( or the rotational velocity of a relatively lighter disc , as in the case of ngc  4258 ) inside @xmath21 should thus decline with the inverse square root of the radius , i.e.  @xmath22 , just as rotational velocities of keplerian discs or solar systems have @xmath23 .    the absence of this clear detection for many galaxies has led merritt ( 2013 ) to question their reported black hole measurements , which may be better interpreted as upper limits until we are better able to resolve the sphere - of - influence ( see also valluri , merritt & emsellem 2004 ) . with this cautionary note , we proceed to the topic of black hole scaling relations , which at the very least would still be upper envelopes in the various diagrams of black hole mass versus host spheroid properties .",
    "it may however then be unusual that all of the clear - cut examples for a definitive black hole reside on this upper envelope ( but see ford et al .",
    "1998 ; ho 1999 , his section  7 ; and batcheldor 2010a ) .",
    "commenting on the ratio of black hole mass to spheroid mass in m31 and m32 , dressler & richstone ( 1988 ) suspected a relation , and used it to predict billion solar mass black holes in bright elliptical galaxies . while the prediction was not new , in the sense that the authors were aware that past theoretical papers had stated that quasars in big elliptical galaxies could have @xmath24 solar mass black holes ( e.g.  rees 1984 ; begelman , blandford & rees 1984 , and references therein ) ,",
    "the idea of a scaling relation with the _ spheroid _ does seem to be new .",
    "dressler ( 1989 ) further advocated this connection between the black hole and the host spheroid ( not the disc ) , and from a sample of 5 galaxies he noted that there is a `` rough scaling of black hole mass with the mass of the spheroidal component '' .",
    "this differed slightly from hutchings et al .",

    "the study by hutchings et al .",

    "however , there is an upper limit to the brightness of quasars which has been observed to scale with the brightness of the host galaxy ( which are typically spheroid - dominated for the brightest quasars ) .",
    "using real data , yee ( 1992 ) fit a linear relation to this limit , which he called the @xmath25@xmath26 relationship , and wrote that `` it may arise due to a correlation of the mass of the central engine and the galaxy mass '' , such that `` the brightest quasars for a given galaxy mass are the ones shining at or near the eddington limit ( which is set by the mass of the central engine ) , while others are at lower luminosities '' . as noted by mcleod ( 1997 ,",

    "ho et al .",
    "1997 ) , likely signalling low - level accretion onto near - dead quasars .    rather than the pure ` linear ' scaling , a single power - law relation was introduced by magorrian et al .",

    "in other works , using variously updated masses and samples , ho ( 1999 ) reported a median @xmath29 ratio of 0.2% , and merritt & ferrarese ( 2001c ) and kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) reported a ratio of 0.13% , although with notable scatter .",
    "mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) noticed that the scatter was considerably reduced once the disc galaxies were excluded , suggestive of poor bulge / disc decompositions used to estimate the bulge masses .",

    "the term `` srsic galaxy '' or `` srsic spheroid '' shall be used to denote galaxies or spheroids ( elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies ) whose surface brightness profile is well described by the srsic ( 1963 , 1968 ) model all the way into the centre of the galaxy .",

    "( 1993 ) demonstrated that the srsic model fits the surface brightness profiles of early - type galaxies remarkably well over a large dynamic range .",
    "an historical and modern review of srsic s model can be found in graham & driver ( 2005 ) .",
    "srsic galaxies may contain additional nuclear flux components above that of the host srsic spheroid .",
    "the term `` core - srsic galaxy '' or `` core - srsic spheroid '' refers to a galaxy whose main spheroidal component has a partially - depleted core ( i.e.  a central stellar deficit of light that is not due to dust ) such that the surface brightness profile is well described by the core - srsic model ( graham et al .",
    "2003b ) . the history of galaxy surface brightness models and the impact that the above systematically ( with luminosity ) varying structures ( i.e.  non - homology and depleted cores ) have on galaxy scaling laws and the unification of bright and faint early - type srsic galaxies is discussed at length in graham ( 2013 ) .",
    "re - analysing the dynamical spheroid mass and ( updated ) black hole mass data for 30 galaxies studied by hring & rix ( 2004 ) , but this time separating the galaxies depending on whether or not they have a partially depleted core , graham ( 2012a ) found that the two populations follow different relations in the @xmath0@xmath49 diagram . while the dozen core - srsic spheroids , which are the more massive spheroids , followed the near - linear relation @xmath50 , the srsic spheroids followed a much steeper power - law relation , such that @xmath51 . excluding the barred galaxies , the srsic relation was @xmath52 .",
    "this near - quadratic relation for the low- and intermediate - mass spheroids had never been reported before and it signalled a bend in the @xmath0@xmath49 diagram .    with an increased sample size of 72 galaxies with directly measured black hole masses , graham & scott ( 2013 ) confirmed this behavior using near - infrared @xmath53-band magnitudes .",

    "the average @xmath61 ratio of these core - srsic galaxies then reflects the value obtained at the high - mass end of the near - quadratic srsic @xmath0@xmath1 relation from which they peeled off . in late 2012 graham & scott ( 2013 )",
    "reported this mass ratio to be 0.49% , in agreement with that already noted by laor ( 2001 ) for massive spheroids .",
    "this ratio is basically the calibration for the yee ( 1992 ) relation between black hole mass and galaxy mass in massive galaxies , modulo the fact that some core - srsic galaxies contain large discs .",
    "furthermore , our own galaxy , with an @xmath61 ratio of 0.05% , is no longer a low outlying point requiring explanation in the @xmath0@xmath1 diagram .",
    "it has a mass ratio in accord with the near - quadratic scaling relation for srsic spheroids .",
    "adding agn data from half a dozen recent papers which had observed the agn black hole masses to reside below the original @xmath0@xmath1 relation , graham & scott ( 2014 ) revealed that they depart from the near - linear @xmath0@xmath1 relation in a systematic manner consistent with the near - quadratic @xmath3@xmath1 mass scaling relation for srsic galaxies .",

    "this is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "this also provides the picture with which we can now interpret the observations by laor ( 1998 , 2001 ) and wandel ( 1999 ) , who were on the right track over a decade ago .    _",

    "however , without the fuller parameter baseline that we now have , or artificially subdividing the data at a srsic index of 2 , or at @xmath65 mag , or where the curvature in relations using ` effective ' radii and surface brightnesses are a maximum ( see graham 2013 for an explanation of this ) , the continuity between the low- and intermediate - luminosity srsic galaxies can be missed , even if the data itself is accurate .",

    "the so - called ` quasar ' or ` cold ' mode of black hole growth during gas - rich processes , as implemented in semi - analytical models , has typically assumed that black hole growth occurs via accretion which is linearly proportional to the inflowing mass of cold gas ( which also produces the host spheroid ) , modulated by an efficiency which is lower for both unequal mass mergers ( croton et al .",

    "given that the majority of srsic spheroids ( i.e.  those without partially depleted cores ) also follow the near - quadratic @xmath0@xmath83 relation , it appears that the masses of black holes in pseudobulges correlate with at least one property of their host bulge , and unless pseudobulges are restricted to have a narrow range of velocity dispersion , then their black hole masses also correlate with velocity dispersion ( or at least define an upper envelope in the @xmath0@xmath5 diagram ) .",
    "a few of the ( often not properly recognised ) difficulties with identifying pseudobulges are noted here , in case it is helpful to some readers . from a kinematical perspective , just as with the formation of rotating elliptical galaxies via mergers , mergers can also create bulges which rotate ( e.g.  bekki 2010 ; keselman & nusser 2012 ) and bars can spin - up classical bulges ( e.g.  saha et al .",

    "this is of interest for several reasons .",
    "one of which is that it may provide insight into the merging scenario , which currently has an unresolved problem . in general , galaxies with the greatest @xmath139 ratio should have experienced the highest number of major dry mergers , and due to the increase in black hole mass but stagnation in velocity dispersion associated with such mergers ( e.g.  ostriker & hausman 1977 ; hausman & ostriker 1978 ; ciotti & van albada 2001 ) , they should be offset to high black hole masses in the @xmath3@xmath5 diagram ( see volonteri & ciotti 2013 ) .",
    "however , they are not ( savorgnan & graham 2014 ) .    within low - luminosity early - type galaxies ,",
    "the nuclear star cluster can be slightly offset ( @xmath42100 parsec ) from the galaxy s photometric centre ( binggeli et al .",
    "2000 ; barazza et al .",
    "this is thought to be due to the dense star cluster s harmonic oscillation within the weak gravitational gradient of the galaxy s core .",
    "the amplitude of the nuclear cluster s rocking back and forth motion is expected to be greater in spheroids with lower srsic index , because they have lower central stellar densities and shallower inner density profiles , and thus less well defined gravitational centres over a greater fraction of their half - light radii ( see terzi & graham 2005 , their figure  2 ) .",
    "similarly , high - luminosity core - srsic spheroids have somewhat weakened gravitational centres ( terzi & graham 2005 , their figure  3 ) due to the partial depletion of stars in their cores .",
    "one may then expect to find the supermassive black holes slightly offset from the photometric centres of core - srsic galaxies ( miller & smith 1992 ; taga & iye 1998 ) .",
    "however a mechanism capable of creating more extreme ( @xmath144 kpc ) offsets is the recoil from the emission of anisotropic gravitational radiation that a newly merged black hole may receive ( e.g.  bonnor & rotenberg 1961 ; peres 1962 ; bekenstein 1973 ) .",
    "the linear momentum carried away by the gravitational wave is balanced by a kick imparted to the black hole .",
    "this recoil process has the ability to evacuate a much greater loss cone , and has been proposed as an explanation for some cores having large @xmath139 ratios ( e.g.  boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2004 ; campanelli et al .",
    "2007 ; gualandris & merritt 2008 , 2012 ) , which have been observed in ngc  1399 and ngc  5061 . while only small spatial offsets are known for black holes in galaxies with directly measured black hole masses ( e.g.  batcheldor et al .  2010b",

    "2012 ) of black holes in galaxies with larger @xmath139 ratios . however , if the damping timescale of the recoil - induced oscillation is sufficiently short , one may not find this correlation .    in passing , it might be remiss if a few words were not said about the gravitational wave signals expected from the final coalescence of massive black holes after they have scoured out the cores of massive spheroids , preferentially removing stars on plunging radial orbits ( e.g.  quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; thomas et al .",

    "it is based on the observation that the black hole mass correlates with the agn radio and x - ray flux in such a way that they define a 2-dimensional surface in 3-parameter space , which has been dubbed the ` fundamental plane of black hole activity ' ( merloni et al .",
    "therefore , obtaining radio and x - ray data is expected to prove fruitful in the hunt for the elusive intermediate mass black holes .",

    "<S> with references to both key and oft - forgotten pioneering works , this article starts by presenting a review into how we came to believe in the existence of massive black holes at the centres of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it then presents the historical development of the near - linear ( black hole)(host spheroid ) mass relation , before explaining why this has recently been dramatically revised . </S>",
    "<S> past disagreement over the slope of the ( black hole)(velocity dispersion ) relation is also explained , and the discovery of sub - structure within the ( black hole)(velocity dispersion ) diagram is discussed . as the search for the fundamental connection between massive black holes and their host galaxies continues , </S>",
    "<S> the competing array of additional black hole mass scaling relations for samples of predominantly inactive galaxies are presented . </S>"
