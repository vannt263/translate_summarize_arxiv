    "baryogenesis is one of the fundamental questions left unanswered by the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "there are many approaches to generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , some examples of which are electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg ) @xcite , leptogenesis @xcite and affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "ewbg is an intriguing possibility because it relies only upon weak scale physics and gives rise to possible direct experimental tests , but it can not take place within the sm @xcite given the current lower bounds on the higgs mass  @xcite .",
    "ewbg could be realized within the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , see @xcite for reviews , but it requires a particular corner of the mssm parameter space known as the light stop scenario ( lss )  @xcite . as the name suggests there are in principle directly testable predictions of new light particles that can be discovered at the lhc .",
    "however , as with many searches at the lhc , depending on the exact spectra , particles with copious production cross sections can be missed if a particular signature is not investigated .",
    "the benefit of the lss is that direct production of stops are not the only test of the scenario . in the mssm",
    "the stop sector is crucial for a viable higgs sector due to the needed radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "the stops also contribute to various effective higgs couplings , most significantly to two gluons .",
    "this intertwining of the two sectors means that there are additional tests of ewbg in the mssm , based purely on the properties of the higgs .",
    "recently , both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) reported intriguing @xmath5 excesses in the diphoton and @xmath6 channels that could be interpreted as early signs of a @xmath0 standard - model - like higgs .",
    "more data is needed to claim discovery , but it is not too early to start thinking about what the implications of such a result might be  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are only two ways that such a heavy higgs could be realized within the mssm : large mixing in the stop sector with relatively light stop masses , or minimal mixing with at least one of the stops being extremely heavy .",
    "this potential higgs mass measurement immediately creates tension with ewbg .",
    "a detailed recent analysis of the lss @xcite showed that a higgs mass of  @xmath0 requires the left - handed ( lh ) stop to be heavier than about @xmath7 , since the stop mixing can not be large .",
    "the right - handed ( rh ) stop , on the other hand , gets pushed to a mass of @xmath8 .",
    "this spectrum is very peculiar , especially when trying to imagine a corresponding susy breaking scheme @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it remains as the _ only realization of ewbg in the mssm_.    before the recent higgs mass measurement , ewbg was reconcilable with a fairly wide variety of higgs phenomenologies @xcite .",
    "now that the stop spectrum has been so strongly constrained by the higgs mass measurement it may be possible to rule out ewbg purely by determining the properties of the higgs boson .",
    "this is particularly attractive , since one could imagine many ways to hide a light stop from direct searches ( e.g. decay through a displaced vertex ) .",
    "using higgs data represents a model - independent approach to excluding ewbg in the mssm .",
    "we will show in this paper that the correlations between different higgs decay channels and production modes , in particular those which occur via loops compared to those that occur at tree level , make predictions that are already in tension with the data . by combining the available constraints from lhc higgs searches ,",
    "we show that _ ewbg in the mssm is already excluded at the ( 90 ) 98% confidence level ( cl ) _ in the ( non-)decoupling limit .",
    "we also examine the exclusion without the assumption of a @xmath0 higgs .",
    "the higgs searches are still highly constraining , excluding the entire ewbg parameter space at the 90% cl except for a small window of @xmath1 due to a small excess seen in the atlas @xmath9 search .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s.review ]",
    "we provide a very brief review of electroweak baryogenesis , which explains the need for the lss in the mssm .",
    "we then discuss the current status of the lss in section section [ s.lss ] and the particular parameter space within the lss dictated by a higgs of mass  @xmath0 . in section [ s.fingerprint ]",
    "we investigate the _ fingerprint of ewbg in the mssm _ , the correlations amongst the different production and decay channels of the higgs that are the signature of the lss . in section [ s.expstatus ] we discuss the available experimental data from lhc higgs searches and combine them to exclude the ewbg parameter space at the 90% cl .",
    "we conclude with section [ s.conclusion ] .",
    "various technical details of the h iggs decay width calculations are included in the appendix .",
    "as is well known , to generate a bau the three sakharov conditions @xcite must be satisfied : @xmath10-violation , @xmath11-violation ( otherwise any @xmath10-producing process is cancelled out by its @xmath11-counterpart ) and departure from thermal equilibrium ( to prevent washout of the accumulated @xmath10-excess ) .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) is a mechanism for producing the bau that relies entirely on weak scale physics to satisfy the sakharov conditions .",
    "the triangle anomaly in the electroweak sector of the standard model leads to non - perturbative sphaleron processes at high temperatures that violate baryon number , complex phases in the higgs - fermion couplings provide the necessary @xmath11-violation , and departure from thermal equilibrium is instigated by the electroweak phase transition .",
    "even though the standard model has all the qualitative ingredients for electroweak baryogenesis , the size of the generated baryon asymmetry falls far short of the required value @xcite .",
    "the phase transition is first order but only weakly so , and there is not enough @xmath11 violation .",
    "this means that electroweak baryogenesis can only work in a theory with additional complex phases , as well as weak - scale particles that interact strongly with the higgs sector to give the necessary additional contributions to its thermal potential .",
    "these conditions can be satisfied in the mssm @xcite : contributions from stops to the thermal potential of the higgs can generate a stronger first order phase transition , and there are many new sources of cp violation available .",
    "the task of computing the generated bau can be approximately factorized , into sectors that are responsible for the first order phase transition , and those directly responsible for creating the baryon asymmetry during that phase transition .",
    "therefore we can examine the constraints or evidence for these sectors independently .",
    "provided that a strong enough first order phase transition occurs , computation of the bau involves a complicated tunneling , quantum transport and hydrodynamics calculation .",
    "@xmath11-violating interactions between the plasma and the space - time varying higgs vev generate chiral currents across the bubble wall , which sphalerons in the unbroken phase convert to baryon asymmetry .",
    "this excess then partially survives in the broken phase , where sphalerons are suppressed , as the bubble expands .",
    "there is a vast literature on this calculation  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties are still order one , and tend to err on the optimistic side @xcite .",
    "that being said , the generation of a sufficient bau seems at least possible within the mssm for some suitably chosen gaugino / higgsino parameters ( @xmath12 ) , _ if _ there is a strong enough first order phase transition .",
    "the only severe constraint from this step of the calculation comes from edms @xcite that can arise as a result of the required @xmath11-violating phases .",
    "the required phases are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the higgs sector soft mass .",
    "one - loop edm contributions can be suppressed by making the first and second generation sfermions heavier than @xmath16 , but two - loop contributions involving the chargino and higgs fields are sizable unless @xmath17 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this generic bound can be loosened if @xmath18 is strongly suppressed relative to @xmath19 , since the phase of the bino - mass by itself does not generate strong two - loop edm contributions . in this _ bino - driven _",
    "scenario @xcite @xmath20 can take on smaller values .",
    "calculating the strength of the first order phase transition is somewhat more straightforward , and ultimately more constraining , than the baryon density calculation .",
    "a sufficiently strong phase transition requires @xmath21 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath22 is the _ critical temperature _ at which the electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum @xmath23 is degenerate with the symmetric minimum @xmath24 . in the one - loop thermal higgs potential",
    "one finds that @xmath25  ( cubic coefficient)/(quartic coefficient ) .",
    "the cubic term comes solely from the thermal contribution and has the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the field dependent thermal mass of the additional scalars in the mssm . to maximize",
    "the strength of the phase transition clearly requires maximizing the new contributions to the cubic term .",
    "given the form of the contribution from the scalars of the mssm , the largest potential contribution will come from the stop sector .",
    "the higgs dependent masses of the stops are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "working along the direction of the zero - temperature higgs - vev in the higgs potential is large , and sufficient for our purposes of demonstrating the effect of stops on @xmath30 . ] , @xmath31 , their mass eigenvalues are @xmath32 ^ 2 .   }",
    "\\ ] ] in the cubic term of the thermal one - loop higgs potential one has to replace the soft masses @xmath33 by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the thermal masses of the lh and rh stops .",
    "( this is necessary to control ir divergences in the one - loop thermal potential and restore the validity of the perturbative expansion at the critical temperature @xcite ) . to maximize the cubic higgs term , one of the stop mass eigenvalues should therefore be close to @xmath37 .",
    "this requires small stop mixing , as well as a fairly precise cancellation between the light stop s thermal mass , @xmath38 , and the necessarily negative stop soft mass - squared @xcite .",
    "this yields one stop that is lighter than the top . to increase the higgs mass beyond the lep limit @xcite and avoid large corrections to the @xmath39-parameter @xcite the lh stop",
    "should then be heavier than a tev or so .",
    "two - loop corrections @xcite are quite large because @xmath40 enters for the first time at this order .",
    "both two - loop and non - perturbative corrections @xcite enhance the phase transition , enlarging the viable parameter space .",
    "this provides a more complete picture of the viable regions of mssm parameter space for electroweak baryogenesis , but the intuition from examining one - loop effects still provides a helpful guide .    putting all these ingredients together leads to the _ light stop scenario _ ( lss)@xcite , the only corner of mssm parameter space where electroweak baryogenesis might be possible .",
    "the constraints on the stop sector parameters are the following :    * achieving a strong phase transition and avoiding color - breaking requires a mostly right - handed light stop with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the mostly left - handed stop should be heavier than @xmath43 to satisfy the lep higgs mass bound ( for a sm - like higgs ) and avoid large corrections to the @xmath39-parameter .",
    "* the gluino should be heavier than @xmath44 to decouple it from the plasma , otherwise its large contribution to the stop thermal masses would make it even more difficult to achieve the needed cancellation @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , there are some constraints on the electroweak gaugino and higgsino parameters to allow for sufficient generation of bau :    * @xmath46 or @xmath47 with sufficiently large @xmath11-violating phases in the -ino sector , as well as @xmath48 @xcite . *",
    "@xmath17 , unless all the @xmath11-violation is pushed into the bino soft mass @xcite .",
    "it is well known to experts that the possible detection of a @xmath49 gev higgs at the lhc spells trouble for electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm .",
    "such a large higgs mass can only be achieved if stop mixing is large ( incompatible with a strong phase transition ) or if the left - handed stop is extraordinarily heavy . to quantify the exact consequences of such a heavy higgs",
    ", we draw upon the results of @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite studied the electroweak baryogenesis window of the mssm in great detail .",
    "they constructed a low - energy effective theory @xcite in which all scalar superpartners with the exception of the rh stop are pushed to some high common scale .",
    "this effective description , tailored to the light stop scenario , included the most important one- and two - loop effects .",
    "they constructed the resulting thermal higgs potential and scanned over the stop- and higgs - sector parameter space . requiring a sufficiently strong first - order phase transition and avoiding color - breaking yields regions of the stop - higgs mass plane where electroweak baryogenesis could proceed within the mssm .",
    "as expected , a higgs mass in the range of @xmath50 is extremely difficult to accommodate .",
    "the stop sector has to take on a very particular form : @xmath51 with stop mixing being completely negligible for such large @xmath52 .",
    "the size of the allowed @xmath53 range is somewhat overestimated , since it was obtained by interpreting the results of the analysis in a _ very _ conservative fashion . therefore , if this stop spectrum can be excluded , then electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm is excluded ( assuming of course that the higgs mass falls into the above mentioned range ) .",
    "the extremely heavy left - handed stop is in significant conflict with notions of naturalness , reminiscent of split supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "one could ask how a high - energy theory of susy breaking could generate such a spectrum @xcite , but let us put aside such considerations and focus on the phenomenology .    the light right - handed stop with a mass of @xmath54",
    "is an extremely interesting _ prediction _ of electroweak baryogenesis within the mssm , emerging as a direct consequence of requiring a sufficiently strong electroweak phase transition and a higgs mass of @xmath0 .",
    "it is already excluded if it decays promptly @xcite or escapes the detector @xcite , but one could imagine it being hidden from direct stop searches somehow , for example by decaying via a displaced vertex @xcite .",
    "the question is then : given a higgs mass of @xmath0 , can electroweak baryogenesis within the mssm be excluded in a model - independent way ?",
    "as it turns out , the answer is yes .",
    "the specific spectrum required by the lss in light of such a higgs mass , especially the light rh stop , makes very definite predictions for the higgs production rate and branching ratios .",
    "this allows us to test electroweak baryogenesis within the mssm using pure higgs data , separate from collider searches for the stop and questions of how such a strange spectrum could be generated by a high - energy theory of susy - breaking .",
    "the presence of a light rh stop can significantly alter higgs production and decay rates compared to their sm expectation . in the context of overall inclusive production cross sections",
    "this has been investigated in detail by  @xcite . however , even without an unambiguous @xmath55 higgs discovery at the lhc , or an extremely precise measurement of the @xmath9 branching fraction , it is _ still _ possible to conclusively test the mechanism of ewbg in the mssm .",
    "this is because the lss makes specific predictions for _ all _ possible production and decay modes of the higgs , and they have very particular correlations .",
    "the presence of the light rh stop affects higgs phenomenology through loop level production via gluon fusion and decays to @xmath9 .",
    "the effects are encoded by examining the partial widths , which can be related to both production and decay .",
    "the leading order contributions to gluon fusion ( in the decoupling limit ) are @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the normalized higgs coupling to the right - handed stop , which in the lss is given by @xmath59 .",
    "the functions @xmath60 ( @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) are defined as @xmath63/\\tau^2\\\\ a_{1/2}(\\tau)&= & 2 \\left[\\tau+(2\\tau-1)f(\\tau)\\right]/\\tau^2\\nonumber\\\\ a_1(\\tau)&= & -\\left[2\\tau^2 + 3\\tau+3(2\\tau-1)f(\\tau)\\right]/\\tau^2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 ^ 2 & \\tau > 1 \\end{array}\\right . .\\ ] ] the crucial point is that the light stop loop interferes constructively with the top quark loop , which leads to a more than three - fold _ increase _ in the higgs production cross section via gluon fusion .",
    "however , when investigating the clean @xmath9 decay channel we must also examine the stop s contribution to the @xmath65 decay width , which at lowest order ( again in the decoupling limit ) is @xmath66 where we have also included the contribution from charginos .",
    "we do not explicitly calculate @xmath67 as a function of the chargino mass , but they can shift the width at most by order @xmath68 if their mass is small , @xmath69 gev , and we include this as a theory uncertainty . unlike for the gluon width , the stops destructively interfere with the dominant contribution in eq .",
    "( [ e.hgagadecay ] ) coming from the @xmath70 bosons , and thus _ decrease _ the decay width @xmath67 by nearly a factor of @xmath71 compared to the sm expectation .",
    "thus , while a light stop can effect both @xmath72 and @xmath67 significantly , the effect can be washed out by looking at the total rate of @xmath73 only . however , there are both additional higgs production and decay modes available at the lhc .    in particular ,",
    "examining both tree level and loop level ( affected by the stop ) production and decay modes in various combinations should reveal strong correlations amongst the various channels .",
    "we call this the _ fingerprint of electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm_. for example , in gluon fusion events with tree level decays one would expect a large increase over standard model rates . however , if one examined vector boson fusion production of a higgs which then decayed to @xmath9 , we would expect a rate smaller than the sm . for ewbg we can give predictions for all the channels , and even without a higgs discovery one can still make strong exclusion statements by considering their correlations .",
    "this is similar in spirit to analyses investigating naturalness and general composite higgs sectors  @xcite .",
    "we use @xcite to compute the ewbg predictions for the higgs decay widths . to understand the various correlations and predictions for ewbg quantitatively",
    "we define ratios of the various production channels , gluon fusion ( ggf ) , vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and associated production ( ap ) , in the lss compared to the sm : @xmath74 @xmath75 is derived by taking ratios of decay widths , while @xmath76 in the decoupling limit .",
    "similarly we can define ratios for the branching fractions @xmath77 compared to the sm as : @xmath78 combining these various production and decay channels we can define a _ partial signal strength _",
    "@xmath79 where @xmath80 labels the higgs decay final state and @xmath81 represents the production channel . as an example , our partial signal strengths for @xmath9 final states when produced through gluon fusion and vector boson fusion are @xmath82 in principle these can both be measured separately , as discussed in section [ s.expstatus ] , in which case a large discernible difference compared to the sm should be found if ewbg takes place within the mssm .",
    "we also consider searches sensitive to both ggf and vbf , with possibly different efficiencies @xmath83 for each production mode . in this case case",
    "the @xmath84 signal strength prediction ( similarly for other channels ) is given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 if the efficiencies for ggf and vbf are comparable .    while ewbg fixes the stops of the mssm to particular values , in principle the value of @xmath20 can range from the decoupling limit to very low values of @xmath20 as in bino - driven ewbg@xcite , while still preserving the successes of ewbg .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is important since it alters the @xmath87 coupling compared to the sm , which in turn rescales @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the effective @xmath11-even higgs mixing angle .",

    "given the large error bars in the early higgs data it is perhaps surprising that we can make relatively strong statements regarding the exclusion of electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "this is due to the correlations of the signal strength predictions in the various channels and their dependence on ewbg parameters .",
    "the higgs signal in the various channels depends only very weakly on @xmath99 , since our parameterization takes @xmath96 as a low - energy input and @xmath99 can not be large for successful ewbg .",

    "dropping the assumption of a 123 - 128 gev higgs allows us to examine the prospects of electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm if the higgs were to sit at a different mass .",

    "we minimize exclusion with respect to theory error , @xmath99 dependence and @xmath20 dependence , using the experimental signal strength bounds for whatever higgs masses they are available ( see table [ t.channels ] ) .",
    "however , there is one additional complication with this expanded higgs mass range : the atlas @xmath134 bounds have extremely asymmetric error bars for @xmath135 .",
    "this suggests a reduced reliability of the gaussian likelihood approximation , and therefore we do not use the atlas @xmath134 bounds for @xmath135 .    what does fig .",
    "[ f.mhmstopexclusion ] imply for mssm ewbg in general ? without a higgs mass constraint , the successful electroweak phase transition requires @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xcite .",

    "including tevatron data does not significantly enhance these constraints . if we were to include the atlas @xmath134 constraints below @xmath140 by naively applying its @xmath141 error bar to @xmath142 and using the gaussian likelihood approximation , then the exclusion of the allowed higgs mass window increases by @xmath143 .",
    "however , given the possibly long tail of the likelihood distribution these numbers must be taken with a grain of salt .    at any rate , it is clear that the lhc higgs searches are already excluding large portions of the lss parameter space , even without the assumption of a particular higgs mass .",
    "further data should allow exclusion of the 117 - 119 gev higgs mass window , but these considerations are of course irrelevant if a higgs mass of @xmath0 is confirmed .",
    "we also point out that our exclusions could likely be improved if the experimental collaborations provided more detailed signal strength likelihoods .",
    "finally , we point out that the discovery or exclusion of the mssm pseudoscalar higgs would of course significantly enhance the power of these constraints by restricting the allowed value of @xmath20 .",
    "ewbg in the mssm has long been an attractive possibility for baryogenesis due to the presence of additional light supersymmetric states within reach of colliders . with the 7 tev run of the lhc",
    "now completed , there finally is enough high energy data to confront the entire parameter space of ewbg .",
    "however , in direct searches there are in principle ways to weaken constraints without affecting the physics of ewbg . in this paper",
    "we looked at the indirect consequences for the higgs sector alone , which represents an irreducible constraint on ewbg in the mssm .",
    "given that the only window for ewbg that still exists is the lss , there are very large corrections to higgs phenomenology and in particular strong correlations amongst channels as we have demonstrated .",
    "we have shown that in the context of a possible higgs mass measurement of @xmath144 at the lhc , ewbg in the mssm is now ruled out at greater than a 98% cl in the decoupling limit for the higgs sector , and at least 90% cl for lighter values of @xmath20 .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that this heavy of higgs mass even further restricts the allowed parameter space for ewbg in the mssm .",
    "if we relax the constraint of @xmath144 , to allow for a larger parameter space , we can _ still _ constrain the lss in full generality with the current lhc data .",
    "we find that the only significant region excluded at less than @xmath145 cl is @xmath146 - @xmath147 .",
    "this window can be excluded with more data , though of course the point is moot if the higgs is confirmed to have a mass of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , one can speculate that lhc higgs searches could in fact offer an almost model - independent way to exclude electroweak baryogenesis , even beyond the mssm implementation . at its very basic level ,",
    "the mechanism of ewbg requires the presence of weak - scale particles with substantial higgs couplings to generate the strong first - order phase transition via their contributions to the thermal potential .",
    "these particles , via those very same couplings , could then significantly contribute to the effective higgs couplings and allows for testing ewbg in other scenarios  @xcite .",
    "while complete exclusion of the electroweak baryogenesis idea may not be possible @xcite , this could nonetheless reduce the array of viable models to a few very special cases .",
    "ultimately , the indirect tests of higgs phenomenology using correlations , such as those we have demonstrated in this paper , may prove to be the most important window into new physics .",

    "this is feasible since we only care about calculating decay widths and production cross sections from a very simple low - energy spectrum , not the derivation of that spectrum from uv - parameters .",
    "the case of small @xmath20 is handled as follows : for each choice of @xmath148 and @xmath20 , we use the expressions in @xcite to derive the lh stop mass required to give the desired higgs mass at one - loop resummed order .",
    "this allows us to compute the radiatively corrected charged and heavy neutral higgs masses at the same order and include their contributions in the light higgs decay widths and branching fractions .",
    "this one - loop resummed calculation might be insufficient if we were actually interested in how exactly the higgs spectrum is derived from a low - energy theory , but for the purposes of ` sweeping through the higgs spectrum ' as we change @xmath20 this is certainly expected to work well .",

    "<S> this allows us to exclude ewbg in the mssm at greater than ( 90 ) 98% confidence level in the ( non-)decoupling limit , by examining correlations between different higgs decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the exclusion without the assumption of a @xmath0 higgs . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs searches are still highly constraining , excluding the entire ewbg parameter space at greater than 90% cl except for a small window of @xmath1 .    </S>",
