    "this long coherence time of the zero quantum ramsey fringe leads to the enhanced precision for the estimations of non - secular hyperfine terms .      according to the eq.([eqs8 ] )",
    ", the zero quantum ramsey fringe is independent of the frequency detuning ( @xmath115 ) of the mw excitation .",

    "the curves in the ( c ) and ( e ) were detuned by 10 mhz and 5 mhz , respectively .",
    "the ffts are the same as shown in ( d ) and ( f ) .",
    "this detune independency of the measured oscillation is an evidence that the coherence measured is the zero quantum coherence , not single quantum .",
    "if it s a single quantum coherence , it should be dependent on the frequency detuning .",
    "the optimal excitation and readout pulse for the zero quantum ramsey fringe is the @xmath120 pulse .",
    "if one use a different pulse duration , such as @xmath88 pulse , the mixture of single quantum and zero quantum coherences appears .",
    "one example is shown in fig .",

    "the fft spectrum shows a zero quantum coherence near 6 mhz in addition to two triplets from 14 to 26 mhz .",
    "single triplet stems from the hyperfine splitting due to the @xmath82n nuclear spin .",
    "the two triplets are split by the amount of the zero quantum frequency , i.e. 6 mhz , which indicates the simultaneous transition of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the disadvantage of the excitation of such multiple coherences is that , a higher number of average is required for the same signal to noise ratio as that of the zero quantum coherence alone .",
    "for instance , the curve in ( c ) was obtained in 30 minutes , but the curve in ( g ) in 5 hours .",
    "in the system of single nv center with single @xmath0c nuclear spin , the energy splitting in the ground state @xmath8 can be measured from the frequency of zero - quantum ramsey fringe .",
    "the perturbation calculation reveals the contributions of hyperfine interaction components in the system hamiltonian @xmath99 to the splitting of the ground state .",
    "this section will be devoted to the description of the calculation procedure and the related physical explanations .      before dealing with the actual hyperfine interaction ,",
    "we start with a simpler form only with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the system hamiltonian , thus , can be written as @xmath158 in which @xmath46 and @xmath159 are gyromagnetic ratios of electron and nuclear spins , and @xmath45 zero - field splitting of electron spin of the nv center .",
    "the two angles @xmath95 and @xmath77 define the orientation of external magnetic field of which strength is @xmath75 . to get the matrix representation of the hamiltonian , ( 6 by 6 )",
    "one may consider the six states @xmath160 ( @xmath78 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 ) as the basis .",
    "this , however , is not a good choice because for the sub - matrix ( 2 by 2 ) of the @xmath99 , represented in the basis of the two states @xmath163 , the off diagonal component can be as large as diagonal ones , shown as below ,    @xmath164    this is because , for nuclear spin states belonging to @xmath8 , the hyperfine interaction becomes ineffective in first order .",
    "the zeeman energy for nuclear spin , therefore , brings non - negligible off - diagonal components when the external magnetic field is tilted from the @xmath165 axis .",
