    "bright solitons are unstable and undergo finite - time blowup which manifests itself in a singular growth of the solution amplitude @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the growing intensity of the wave field makes it necessary to account for nonlinearities of higher orders , and the collapse can be arrested by the defocusing quintic nonlinearity .",
    "this idea has motivated intensive studies of cubic - quintic ( cq ) generalizations of nlse @xcite .",
    "additional relevance of inclusion of cq nonlinearity into the standard nlse model is justified by the possibility to establish similarities between propagating light and a liquid for the 2d case @xcite .",

    "in particular , such coupled systems allow one to account for polarization effects  @xcite , describe vector and mixed solitons ( i.e. , paired bright and dark solitons )  @xcite , simulate soliton switching  @xcite , and describe the symmetry breaking , the latter corresponding to a transition from a symmetric state which bears identical fields in both components to an asymmetric one  @xcite . in the meantime",
    ", much less information is available about the wave dynamics in more sophisticated systems of three coupled equations , which , to the best of our knowledge , were mainly studied in the context of the mean - field theory of spinor bose - einstein condensates , where the main attention was focused on the repulsive interactions ( i.e. , the defocusing nonlinearity in the optical terminology )  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a natural generalization of coupled nlse - like systems resides in the possibility of inclusion of the effects related to the gain and loss .",
    "one of particularly interesting cases corresponds to the situation of parity - time ( @xmath0- ) symmetric arrangement of gain and lossy cores @xcite .",
    "the simplest and experimentally feasible @xmath0-symmetric configuration can be implemented in the form of two coupled optical waveguides , one of which experiences gain and another one corresponds to the losses  @xcite .",
    "dynamics of solitons in such a @xmath0-symmetric coupler has received a considerable recent attention in 1d  @xcite and in 2d  @xcite settings . however , to the best of our knowledge , @xmath0-symmetric solitons in triple - core waveguides have not been reported , so far . in the meantime , it is known that such an important feature as @xmath0-symmetry breaking ( i.e. , reality of the spectrum of the underlying linear system ) is very sensitive not only to the distribution and balance between gain and losses but also to the geometry of the waveguides ( depending on whether they are assembled in an open or a closed chain ) and to the number of waveguides ( either even or odd )  @xcite .",

    "more specifically , we classify possible types of vector bright solitons and reveal symmetry breaking bifurcations in the conservative chain .",
    "next , we touch upon the properties of underlying linear problem in the @xmath0-symmetric case where the system possesses a nonzero @xmath0-symmetry breaking threshold , provided that there exists a mismatch in the couplings between the sites . as the main outcome of our work , we numerically show that there exist two branches of @xmath0-symmetric solitons which are stable as long as the strength of the gain - and - loss is small enough . upon increase of the gain - and - loss parameter",
    "the solitons become unstable ; however the families of these unstable solutions can be continued to the arbitrary strength of the gain - and - loss , even to the domain of the broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "thus the present work is focused on the model governed by the following equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the dimensionless amplitudes of the electric field in the three cores , @xmath3 is the propagation distance , @xmath4 is the 2d laplace operator in the transverse plane @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 are the cq nonlinearities , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the coupling coefficients and @xmath11 is the gain - and - loss parameter . for @xmath12",
    "the system is conservative , as no gain and losses are present .",
    "the case @xmath13 preserves the @xmath0 symmetry , where the first equation describes gain , the third equation describes a lossy waveguide , and the second equation remains neutral . from the formal point of view , @xmath0 symmetry manifests itself in the following property : for any solution @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the transpose of system ( [ 3eqsgamma ] ) there also exists another solution @xmath16 where the parity @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 and the anti - linear operator @xmath19 acts according to @xmath20 ( hereafter the asterisk @xmath21 denotes the complex conjugation ) .",
    "notice that @xmath0 symmetry requires not only the balanced gain and loss ( @xmath22 in the first waveguide and @xmath23 in the third waveguide ) , but also the equal coupling @xmath24 between the waveguides with @xmath25 and the waveguides with @xmath26 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "first , we analyzed interaction of asymmetric solitons in the conservative system .",
    "initially quiescent solitons had a relative phase @xmath138 between them and were separated by a relatively small distance @xmath139 .",
    "the respective initial distributions were prepared as follows : @xmath140 we have observed that in - phase solitons , @xmath141 , attract each other and undergo inelastic collision after which they merge in a single pulse , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "out - of - phase solitons , @xmath142 , repel each other , similarly to what happens in the system of two equations @xcite .",
    "+    we have also considered two @xmath0-symmetric solitons which were launched towards each other with an initial velocity from a certain distance .",
    "after the collision , the solitons combine one more time in a single pulse .    however , initially out - of - phase solitons , i.e. , having initial relative phase @xmath142 , do not recombine , but move outwards after the collision ( see fig .  [ fig11 ] ) , and the distance between them grows indefinitely .",
    "the repulsion between the out - of - phase solitons is additionally illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , which shows how the solitons do not cross at @xmath143 .",
    "we have studied a model of a triple - core wave guide described by a system of three coupled two - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equations with the cubic ( focusing ) ",
    "quintic ( defocusing ) nonlinearity . in the first part of the work , we have considered the conservative case and classified possible families of bright solitons .",
    "the most interesting effect found is the symmetry - breaking bifurcation occurs at varying strength of the coupling or at growing propagation constant .",
    "the stability of the found solitons has been addressed in details .    in the second part of the work",
    ", we have extended the analysis onto the @xmath0-symmetric system , where one of the waveguides was lossy and another one active , with gain and losses balancing each other .",
    "we have demonstrated that such three - waveguide structure supports solitons .",
    "two branches of solitons can be stable , at least for sufficiently weak gain - and - losses .",
    "unlike in the case of two coupled equations @xcite , the branches of @xmath0-symmetric solitons can be continued into the domain of arbitrarily strong gain - and - losses parameter .",
    "however , in this last limit the @xmath0-symmetry is broken what means instability of the solitons .",
    "finally , the interactions and collisions between the solitons were briefly investigated .",
    "we observed merge of two in - phase solitons into a stable one and repelling of two out - of - phase solitons .",
