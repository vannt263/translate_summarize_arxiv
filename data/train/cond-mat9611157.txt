    "since the success of observing the vortex core image by hess",
    "_ et al . _ in the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments , it has been possible to investigate experimentally the local density of states ( ldos ) around a vortex core in type ii superconductors.@xcite this investigation has revealed a rich internal electronic structure associated with a vortex core , and should be important for understanding the conventional and unconventional superconductors .",
    "then , to extract further information from the experimental data , the detailed calculation of the ldos is expected from the theoretical side .",
    "hess _ et al .",
    "_ have done a series of beautiful stm experiments on a layered hexagonal compound 2h-@xmath1 ( @xmath2=7.3k ) to reveal the detailed spatially resolved electronic structure around a vortex core.@xcite they provided direct images of individual vortices and the flux line lattice .",
    "their experiment is the first one detecting the quasiparticle state bound to the vortex core , which was theoretically predicted by caroli , de gennes and matricon.@xcite further , the remarkable result is the sixfold star - shaped ldos around a vortex.@xcite their results are summarized as follows when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the hexagonal plane : ( 1 ) the ldos for quasiparticle excitations has a sixfold star - shape centered at a core .",
    "( 2 ) the orientation of this star depends on the bias energy . at zero bias , the `` ray '' of the star extends away from the nearest - neighbor direction where the conventional @xmath3 abrikosov vortex lattice is formed . upon increasing the bias voltage ,",
    "the star rotates by @xmath4 and the ray extends to the nearest - neighbor direction .",
    "( see fig . 4 in ref . or fig . 1 in ref . . )",
    "( 3 ) in the intermediate bias voltage , a ray splits into a pair of nearly parallel rays , keeping its direction fixed ( see the stm image for 0.48 mv in fig . 1 of ref . ) .    recently ,",
    "on the other hand , maggio - aprile _ et al . _",
    "have succeeded in observing the stm image of the vortex cores on a high-@xmath2 superconductor @xmath5.@xcite one of the point in analyzing their stm image of vortex is how the gap anisotropy ( @xmath6-wave in the high @xmath2 superconductor ) affects the ldos around a vortex .    to understand these experimental results , the concrete form of the ldos structure",
    "is expected to be calculated from the theoretical side .",
    "so far , the ldos around a vortex was calculated by gygi and schlter,@xcite and shore _",
    "et al._@xcite from the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation .",
    "the calculations of the ldos based on the quasi - classical eilenberger ( qce ) theory@xcite were done by klein,@xcite and ullah _",
    "et al._@xcite for an isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "while these calculations showed that the vortex image observed by stm is due to the quasiparticle state bound to the vortex core , they investigated only the case of an isolated single vortex , and based on the assumption of the cylindrically symmetric vortex core structure . in a @xmath6-wave superconductor , the ldos around an isolated single vortex was calculated by schopohl and maki,@xcite and ichioka _",
    "et al._@xcite however , the ldos in the vortex lattice case has not been calculated so far .    on the other hand ,",
    "the stm experiments associated with the vortex core are usually performed at high magnetic fields , where the distance between vortices is short and the overlap of the vortex core with that of the nearest - neighbor vortices can not be neglected .",
    "in this situation , the ldos around a vortex core is expected to break cylindrical symmetry and show sixfold symmetric structure when the vortex lattice forms an triangular lattice .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the ldos in the triangular vortex lattice by using the qce theory , and clarify its sixfold symmetric structure .",
    "it is expected to be observed at a high magnetic field . for the case",
    "cylindrical symmetry is broken , the qce approach is more suitable than the bdg approach .    as for the sixfold symmetric structure of the ldos observed by hess _",
    "et al_.,@xcite gygi and schlter @xcite discussed it on the basis of the bdg theory by introducing a sixfold symmetric perturbation term and using their numerical solutions of the cylindrical symmetric case . while they explained the above - mentioned experimental features ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the origin of their perturbation term is not clear , and it is uncertain whether the sixfold symmetric term can be treated by a perturbation theory .",
    "we note that their theory can not determine the absolute orientation of the star relative to the vortex lattice configuration , since in their theory the orientation is determined by the sign of the perturbation term , which is given as an assumption .    as for the origin of the sixfold symmetric vortex structure ,",
    "the following three possibilities are enumerated within the weak coupling bcs theory ; the effect of the vortex lattice ( that is , the effect of nearest - neighbor vortices ) , the effect of a sixfold symmetrically anisotropic @xmath0-wave pairing , and the effect of the sixfold symmetrically anisotropic density of states at the fermi surface . in this paper , we focus on the effect of the vortex lattice by calculating the ldos naively in the vortex lattice case . the contribution of this effect should be clarified before considering other anisotropic effects .",
    "the contribution of the other anisotropic effects is investigated elsewhere.@xcite    the quasi - classical calculation in the vortex lattice case was so far performed by klein in the case of low-@xmath7 type ii superconductors such as ta or nb.@xcite he calculated the spatial variation of the pair potential and magnetic field , where the eilenberger equation is solved self - consistently in the matsubara frequency and he succeeded in solving it by either the so - called symmetry method or the so - called explosion method.@xcite he also tried the calculation of the ldos,@xcite where the eilenberger equation is solved in real energy instead of the matsubara frequency by using the self - consistently obtained pair potential and vector potential . in this real energy case , he could calculate only the momentum - resolved ldos for specific @xmath8 ( the relative momentum of the cooper pair ) direction because only the symmetry method was used . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the ldos following the method suggested by klein.@xcite however , as we succeed in solving the eilenberger equation in the real energy case for arbitrary @xmath8 directions by using the explosion method , we can calculate the momentum - resolved ldos for arbitrary @xmath8 directions .",
    "then we can obtain the ldos integrated over all @xmath8 directions .",
    "the ldos in the vortex lattice is an important physical quantity , since it can be observed directly by the stm experiments . and",
    "further , it can be a clue of estimating the transfer of the quasi - particle bound states between vortex cores .",
    "this transfer leads to the band structure of the bound states as suggested by canel.@xcite if the enough transfer exists , it makes the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) oscillation possible even in the superconducting state , which is observed in the materials such as @xmath1@xcite and @xmath5.@xcite    in our calculations , we consider the same situation as that hess _",
    "_ performed their stm experiments on @xmath1.@xcite we use the material parameter appropriate to @xmath1 , and assume that the fermi surface is two dimensional , which is appropriate to @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the hexagonal plane , that is , along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the case of the triangular vortex lattice in an isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductor is considered in the clean limit .",
    "the fermi surface and the energy gap of the superconductivity are assumed to be isotropic in order to exclude other origins of anisotropy and to clarify the vortex lattice effect on the ldos around a vortex . throughout the paper , energies and lengths",
    "are measured in units of the uniform gap @xmath10 at @xmath11 and the coherence length @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the fermi velocity and @xmath14 bcs coherence length ) , respectively .",

    "the calculation based on the eilenberger theory is performed by following the method suggested by klein.@xcite first , we obtain the pair potential and vector potential self - consistently by solving the eilenberger equation in the matsubara frequency .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ) , @xmath120 ( line ob ) and @xmath4 ( line oc ) radial directions . in the figures ,",
    "we show the spectrum at @xmath141 for the @xmath119 direction , @xmath142 for the @xmath120 direction and @xmath143 for the @xmath4 direction , where we choose the point for @xmath107=0 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.6 , 1 . as for the case",
    "@xmath134 tesla , fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] shows the spectrum at the points along the @xmath119 direction . for @xmath135 ,",
    "the spectrum has the similar structure as that of the single vortex case ( see fig . 2 in ref . for comparison",
    ") . at higher energy ,",
    "the peak at @xmath144 in the single vortex case becomes broad and shifts a little to higher energy side due to the vortex lattice effect . along the other radial directions , the ldos has the almost similar spectrum as that of the @xmath119 direction .",
    "small differences are shown only for @xmath145 .",
    "on the other hand , the spectrum for @xmath136 tesla is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , where ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are that along @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath4 radial directions , respectively .",
    "it is notable that the lower energy peak in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] splits into two or three peaks in this higher field case .",
    "the behavior of these peaks varies depending on the direction of the radial lines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ( a)-(c ) .",
    "the peak above @xmath144 in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] is suppressed in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "the peak of the spectrum at the boundary point ( @xmath146 ) shifts to higher energy from 1 .      here , to discuss the transfer of the quasiparticle bound states between vortex cores , we focus on the ldos structure at @xmath87 . with increasing a magnetic field , the peak of the ldos at the vortex center decreases ( @xmath14771 for 0.1 tesla , 65 for 1 tesla , 44 for 2 tesla and 11 for 4 tesla ) , and the distribution of the ldos extends sixfold symmetrically to the wider region .",
    "therefore , the ldos around the vortex core is connected each other at high magnetic field even in the zero energy state . to show the connection clearly , the ldos for @xmath148 tesla and 4 tesla is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:11 ] and [ fig:12 ] . at @xmath148 tesla in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ( a ) , the ldos around the vortex core is connected each other at the middle point of the line ac of fig .",

    "[ fig:11 ] ( b ) , the ldos is seems to have the component uniformly distributing all over the unit cell .",
    "there , the ldos has small peak at the vortex center and minimum at the stationary point of the current flow ( point a of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . with raising a magnetic field , the ldos at the boundary of the wigner - seitz cell increases ( its maximum value is 0.01 for 0.1 tesla , 0.18 for 1 tesla , 0.44 for 2 tesla and 0.90 for 4 tesla ) , which means that the transfer of the quasiparticle bound states between vortex cores increases .",
    "on @xmath1 , the dhva oscillation is observed at magnetic fields down to 4 tesla in the superconducting mixed state . as discussed above ,",
    "we show that there is large transfer of the bound state between vortex cores in this high field region .",
    "this transfer seems to be a possible origin of the dhva oscillation in superconductors .",
    "by using the self - consistently obtained pair potential and vector potential , the ldos of the triangular vortex lattice is calculated in an isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductors based on the quasi - classical eilenberger theory .",
    "important results obtained for the vortex lattice are as follows ; ( i ) we do find a sixfold star shape of the ldos and the @xmath4 rotation upon elevating the bias energy .",
    "the sixfold star originates from the triangular vortex lattice effect .",
    "( ii ) the orientation of the star coincides with the stm data , namely the ray extends toward the next nearest - neighbor vortex direction at lower bias energy .",
    "therefore we succeed in determining the absolute direction relative to the vortex lattice .",
    "this is one of the most eminent features in the stm data by hess _",
    "et al._@xcite thus the experimental features ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] are qualitatively reproduced by the naive calculation of the ldos in the triangular vortex lattice .",
    "( iii ) for @xmath150 , the ldos distributes around the boundary of the wigner - seitz cell of the vortex lattice , and there are little distribution around the vortex core region .",
    "therefore , the vortex core is detected as a sixfold symmetric dark object in the stm images . at the energy @xmath151 ,",
    "the ldos has large intensity at the point farthest from the vortex center ( the point c in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "( iv ) the characteristic sixfold symmetric ldos structure in the low energy case appears only at a high magnetic field such as 1 tesla for the material parameters appropriate to @xmath1 , where the core regions substantially overlap each other . at a lower magnetic field such as 0.1 tesla",
    ", the ldos reduces to the almost cylindrical structure in the low energy case .    as mentioned above",
    ", the numerically obtained ldos in the vortex lattice case can qualitatively reproduce the characteristic features ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the experimental data on @xmath1 .",
    "however , the detailed comparison reveals some discrepancies between the experimental data and our results , as follows ; ( v ) at the intermediate energy of the @xmath4 rotation , our results does not reproduce the split parallel ray structure ( the feature ( 3 ) mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] ) . in the experiment ,",
    "the ray of the star in the @xmath4 direction at @xmath87 splits into two parallel rays with elevating @xmath65 . in our results ,",
    "the ray along the @xmath4 direction at @xmath87 weakens and new ray starts to extend along the @xmath119 direction with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "( vi ) the shape of the star in our results is rather different from the experimental data at @xmath87 . in the experimental data",
    ", the ray of the star sharply extends with the narrow width along the @xmath4 direction . on the other hand",
    ", the ray extends with wide width in our results .",
    "( vii ) in our results , the structure of the ldos has cylindrical symmetry at a low magnetic field in the low energy case .",
    "however , in the experiment by hess _",
    "_ , the clear star - shaped structure is observed at low fields down to 500 gauss .",
    "these discrepancies mean that we have to consider the other effects in addition to the vortex lattice effect studied here in order to reproduce the detailed ldos structure of @xmath1 observed by hess _",
    "et al_. if we consider the effect of the anisotropic @xmath0-wave pairing which has sixfold symmetrically anisotropic gap in the basal plane , the stm images by hess _",
    "_ are quite well reproduced .",
    "we report it in detail elsewhere.@xcite it suggests that the well - studied material @xmath1 seems to be one particular system which has anisotropic pairing .",
    "our calculation is performed for the idealized isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the characteristic features numerically obtained in this paper are expected to be well observed in other materials which are isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductors .    to discuss the transfer of the quasiparticle bound states between vortex cores",
    ", we consider the ldos structure at @xmath87 . at high magnetic fields , the ldos around the vortex core",
