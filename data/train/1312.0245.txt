    "the nucleon and its excitation spectrum is of fundamental interest for our understanding of the visible nature in terms of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the non - perturbative regime . whereas the nucleon itself is mainly investigated in electron scattering by its form factors and densities as well as in compton scattering by polarizabilities , the excitation spectrum is traditionally explored in elastic and inelastic pion nucleon scattering and meson photo- and electroproduction . while the electromagnetic excitation of nucleon resonances was for a long time just the source for obtaining the photon decay amplitudes and the transition form factors , in recent years",
    ", the accuracy of data in photo- and electroproduction has increased so much that this reaction has now also become a source for possible observations of new resonances or for confirmations and establishments of such resonances that have only been ` seen ' in other reactions with rather uncertain parameters in the particle data listings . just recently in the 2012 issue of the listings of the particle data group ( pdg ) a series of @xmath4 resonances",
    "have been established mainly due to precise data in kaon photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the simplest process to detect and to study nucleon resonances is the elastic pion nucleon scattering .",
    "it has the largest cross sections , it is a two - body process with a simple kinematical structure and it is described by only two spin degrees of freedom , giving rise to two scattering amplitudes and four polarization observables .",
    "this field was pioneered by hoehler@xcite and cutkosky@xcite and led to the detection of most of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances .",
    "their determinations of masses , widths , partial decay widths , pole positions and residues are still considered as of high quality in the pdg .",
    "after shutdown of the pion beams , experimental activities in pion nucleon scattering practically stopped about 20 years ago . nevertheless , an impressive progress has been achieved in the last decade , mostly by shaping up the analyzing tools and developments of various models , first to mention the dynamical models , some of them with 8 and more coupled channels  @xcite .    on the other side ,",
    "the construction of modern electron accelerators , new detector systems and polarized targets led to an enormous progress on experiments in photo- and electroproduction .",
    "next to pion nucleon scattering , the photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath6 is the simplest process to analyze .",
    "it is described by four spin degrees of freedom with 4 complex amplitudes , usually given as cgln , invariant , helicity or transversity amplitudes , all of them are linearly related to each other . with these four amplitudes , 16 polarization observables are defined and can be measured with linearly or circularly polarized photon beams , polarized targets and recoil polarization detection .    already around the year 1970",
    "people started to think about how to determine the four complex helicity amplitudes for pseudoscalar meson photoproduction from a complete set of experiments . in 1975",
    "barker , donnachie and storrow published their classical paper on ` complete experiments '  @xcite .",
    "after reconsiderations and careful studies of discrete ambiguities , in the 90s  @xcite it became clear that such a model independent amplitude analysis would require at least 8 polarization observables which have to be carefully chosen .",
    "there are a large number of possible combinations , but all of them would require a polarized beam and target and in addition also recoil polarization measurements .",
    "technically this was not possible until very recently , when transversely polarized targets came into operation at mainz , bonn and jlab and furthermore recoil polarization measurements by nucleon rescattering have been shown to be doable .",
    "a complete experiment is a set of measurements which is sufficient to predict all other possible experiments , provided that the measurements are free of uncertainties .",
    "therefore it is first of all an academic problem , which can be solved by mathematical algorithms . in practise , however , it will not work in the same way and either a very high statistical precision would be required , which is very unlikely , or further measurements of other polarization observables are necessary .",
    "this has been studied by ireland  @xcite with information entropy , by a joint mainz / gwu collaboration  @xcite with event based pseudo data generated from the maid model  @xcite , by a jlab collaboration with both experimental and pseudo data for kaon photoproduction  @xcite and in a very recent work by the ghent group  @xcite with a combination of kaon photoproduction data measured at graal and additional pseudo data from a theoretical model .",
    "in fact , photoproduction of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are ideal for the complete experiment analysis , as the necessary recoil polarization observables can be obtained from the self - analyzing decay of the hyperons . in case of pion and eta photoproduction",
    "this is very different and recoil polarization can only be detected by an additional elastic scattering of the outgoing nucleon on a spin - zero nucleus as @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this reduces already very much the count rates , but even more , it does only allow a measurement of the transverse component of the recoil polarization in the laboratory frame . in this way , the necessary recoil polarization observables in the cms frame can not be measured .",
    "but even for kaon photoproduction , where the first complete experiment analysis is only a question of time , an important problem remains with the unknown overall phase .",
    "any set of quadratic equations must suffer from the problem that the underlying amplitudes can only be solved up to an overall phase .",
    "for the four complex amplitudes in pseudoscalar photoproduction , this means , that the full solution gives just 4 absolute magnitudes and 3 relative phases .",
    "the residual overall phase remains undetermined .",
    "in the literature , two methods have been discussed , which are both highly academic and can not be used in practise .",
    "the first goes back to goldberger  @xcite in 1963 with a hanbury - brown and twiss experiment , the second was recently published by ivanov  @xcite in 2012 , using vortex beams to measure the phase of a scattering amplitude . even though the missing overall phase is no problem for reconstructing all 16 possible polarization observables , it does not allow to perform a partial wave analysis , because of the fact that this phase is a function of both energy and angle . without knowing this angle dependence",
    "a partial wave projection will not give meaningful partial wave amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "an escape from this trap can be found in the truncated partial wave analysis ( tpwa ) . in this method ,",
    "all 16 polarization observables are expanded in a partial wave series up to a given maximal angular momentum @xmath10 , where all partial wave amplitudes are only functions of the energy . in 1981",
    "omelaenko  @xcite showed that such a complete truncated partial wave analysis is possible with even less than 8 observables .",
    "in fact he proved that with only 4 observables , unpolarized cross section @xmath0 , photon beam asymmetry @xmath1 , target polarization @xmath2 and recoil polarization @xmath3 , the sets of quadratic equations with multipoles can be solved up to a discrete ambiguity for any given @xmath10 . and",
    "in order to resolve this final ambiguity , only one more double polarization is needed , e.g. @xmath11 , while a measurement of @xmath12 or @xmath13 would not suffice .",
    "this is a rather surprising result , as it even allows a complete analysis for pion or eta photoproduction without the need of recoil polarization observables . the single recoil polarization @xmath3 can more easily be measured in a beam - target double polarization experiment .",
    "as in the previous case , also here , the full solution will determine all partial waves only up to an overall phase , however , this phase is now only dependent on the energy , and with some theoretical assumptions , e.g. unitarity and watson theorem , this phase can be constructed .",
    "this was first performed for @xmath14 in 1989 by grushin et al .",
    "@xcite for a complete tpwa in the delta region .",
    "the aim of this paper is to revisit the omelaenko paper  @xcite , published more than 30 years ago .",
    "the formalism of this paper is not so easy to follow in the shortness of the original publication and the paper never gained much attention .",
    "we have extended and further clarified the formalism and have applied the method of ambiguities to modern partial wave analyses ( pwa ) as maid  @xcite , said  @xcite and bnga  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also considered truncations beyond @xmath15 waves and discuss also higher partial waves .",
    "we also investigate the possibilities for unique numerical solutions with current pwa .",
    "the work of omelaenko is based on investigations on ambiguities arising in the analysis of @xmath16 scattering that were performed by gersten  @xcite in 1969 .",
    "both approaches proceed via appropriately representing the spin amplitudes describing the process by products . for the sake of completeness",
    ", it should also be mentioned that for @xmath16 scattering an alternative scheme for obtaining product representations was proposed by barrelet  @xcite in 1972 ( see  @xcite for a brief treatment on this subject ) .",
    "the latter approach is generally referred to as the method of barrelet zeros .",

    "the approach of omelaenko from 1981  @xcite was revisited and supplemented by more information on intermediate calculational steps .",
    "this above mentioned approach consists of first searching for all possible ambiguities of the group s observables and then selecting appropriate double polarization measurements that can remove all additional solutions .",
    "one ambiguity , called the double ambiguity , can be predicted just by the formalism .",
    "it can be removed for all energy regions and all orders in the truncation angular momentum @xmath106 by a measurement of the observables @xmath118 and @xmath117 or any beam - recoil as well as target - recoil double polarization observable .",
    "however there can also exist numerically accidental ambiguities that may require information on additional double polarization observables .    as a numerical application of the presented formalism , the investigation of an s- and p - wave truncation ( i.e. @xmath62 ) also executed similarly in ref .",
    "@xcite was done using multipoles of the partial wave analysis solution maid2007  @xcite as input .",
    "it was found that for this situation , i.e. in a treatment that disregards measurement uncertainty , accidental ambiguities can be neglected and only the double ambiguity has to be removed .",
    "therefore in this case the sets of @xmath122 observables @xmath123 can be postulated as complete sets of observables for this simplest case in the context of the study . as derived in sect .",
    "[ sec : doublepolarizationobs ] , the double polarization observables @xmath117 or @xmath118 can also be replaced by any one of the recoil observables of the groups br and tr .",
    "the development of the situation for increasing @xmath106 is as follows .",
    "the number of new sets of potentially ambiguous solutions is @xmath124 for every @xmath106 .",
    "although not all of these solutions have to fulfill all of the consistency requirements in order to be regarded as realistic ambiguities , the number of candidates that potentially could fulfill all those requirements is vastly increasing .",
    "this increasing difficulty with growing angular momentum @xmath106 is also described in ref .",
    "it is therefore likely that , at least as soon as real data are fitted , the complete sets given above have to be extended by additional observables for higher values of @xmath106 .    as an outlook it is interesting whether the results found in this work apply to the numerical fitting of data .",
    "the following procedure is proposed for these fits .",
    "first , numerical precision data for polarization observables generated by use of existing pwa solutions should be fitted .",
    "these data do not carry statistical fluctuations and have numerical uncertainties given by the number of digits in the tables . in this case",
    "it is expected that the accidental ambiguities are not significant , since only precise equalities of phases are relevant , which are relatively infrequent .",
    "the numerical precision data could then be used in order to generate pseudo data that are closer to the realistic situation by carrying adjustable uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "fits to these data then have to show how significant the impact of varying uncertainties is on the appearance of additional ambiguous solutions .",
    "however , both fitting procedures proposed until now are only preparatory steps .",
    "the final goal is to investigate the fitting to real data from the world database of a specific photoproduction channel , for example @xmath63 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether it will be possible to arrive at a final unique multipole solution by using only group s and beam - target double polarization observables , exclusively .",
