    "the navier - stokes equation governing fluid flow is deterministic .",
    "nevertheless , the statistical description of fully developed turbulence has a long tradition @xcite .",
    "random multiplicative cascade models form a particularly simple and robust class of such statistical models , reproducing important observed features such as multiplier distributions and their correlations @xcite and related kramers - moyal coefficients reflecting markovian properties @xcite .",
    "the models have worked almost too well in the sense that different cascade - generating probability density functions ( pdf s or `` splitting functions '' ) @xmath1 for the multiplicative weights have been equally successful in reproducing these observables .",
    "more sophisticated ways to distinguish between them are clearly desirable .",
    "while some experiments have concentrated on measuring statistics in the energy dissipation density @xmath2 , we recently found a complete analytical solution working in @xmath0 rather than @xmath2 itself @xcite .",
    "we here and in ref .",
    "@xcite show that cumulants in @xmath0 are analytically calculable even when translational invariance is restored in order to emulate the spatial homogeneity of experimental turbulence statistics .",
    "both one- and two - point cumulants turn out to be powerful tools which for third and fourth order differ not only in magnitude but even in sign for splitting functions which are indistinguishable in terms of other observables . unlike multifractal scaling exponents , for example , such cumulants can be expected to distinguish between different models for sufficiently large experimental samples .",
    "energy flux densities @xmath2 are generated in the simplest multiplicative cascade models as follows . in successive steps",
    "@xmath3 , the integral scale @xmath4 is divided into equal intervals of length @xmath5 and dyadic addresses @xmath6 with @xmath7 or @xmath8 . at each step",
    "@xmath9 , the energy flux density @xmath10 generates fluxes multiplicatively in the two subintervals via @xmath11 where the random variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the left and right subintervals are drawn from a given cascade - generating pdf @xmath1 , independently of other branches and generations of the dyadic tree .",
    "when after @xmath14 cascade steps the smallest scale @xmath15 is reached , the local amplitudes of the flux density field @xmath16 at positions @xmath17 in units of @xmath18 are interpreted as the energy dissipation amplitudes which are to be compared to experimental time series converted to one - dimensional spatial series by taylor s frozen flow hypothesis .",
    "we have shown previously @xcite that , since the product of multiplicative weights ( [ nlyb ] ) becomes additive on taking the logarithm , @xmath19 the multivariate cumulant generating function for @xmath0 has the analytical solution @xmath20 where the branching cumulant generating function @xmath21 has arguments @xmath22 ( see figure  1 ) and is defined by the mellin transform of the splitting function , @xmath23,\\ ] ] because of the simplicity of ( [ nlyd ] ) , @xmath21 can often be found analytically .",
    "a host of analytical predictions for statistics in @xmath0 follow , starting with any and all @xmath24-multivariate cumulants obtained directly from @xmath25 through @xmath26 for arbitrary dyadic bin addresses @xmath27 .",
    "these multivariate cumulants in @xmath0 are easily calculated since , due to the additivity of @xmath25 in ( [ nlyc ] ) , they are simple sums @xcite of _ same - lineage cumulants _ @xmath28 and _ splitting cumulants _ @xmath29 in @xmath30 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ rstf ] ) and ( [ twpb ] ) below ) , @xmath31 where without loss of generality we have assumed @xmath32 to be symmetric in its arguments .",
    "before the above theoretical cumulants can be compared to experimentally measured ones , the issue of translational invariance must be dealt with . clearly , the generating function ( [ nlyc ] ) and its cumulants ( [ nlye ] ) are not translationally invariant , in conflict with the homogeneous statistics characterising experimental results .",
    "spatially homogeneous statistics can , however , be emulated by creating a theoretical time series consisting of a chain of @xmath33 adjacent independent cascade fields with @xmath34 finest - scale bins each @xcite . in analogy to the experimental situation , an observation window of width @xmath35 is successively moved over this series in bin - sized steps , @xmath36 , successively `` seeing '' parts of adjacent cascade configurations : see figure 2 .",
    "a translationally invariant one - point moment density would thus be constructed as @xmath37 which should be comparable to the experimental time series . operationally , this can be implemented by keeping only one cascade while averaging over many different cascade configurations , i.e.   @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 denoting configuration averaging .",
    "likewise , a translationally invariant two - point density with constant distance @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) between the two bins would be simulated by two adjacent cascades , @xmath43 with @xmath44 . as shown in figure  3 , bin @xmath45 at some stage in the summation",
    "exceeds @xmath46 and hence would refer to the right - hand cascade while @xmath47 would refer to the left - hand one .",
    "given that the model provides solutions in terms of cumulants , it is tempting to apply this averaging prescription directly to cumulants also , i.e.  to define @xmath48 using for @xmath49 theoretical expressions obtained from ( [ nlye ] ) .",
    "however , experimental cumulants are derived from measured moments rather than the other way round @xcite ( for example @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , so that averaging over moments rather than cumulants is mandatory for theory also .",
    "the proper procedure is hence to convert theoretical cumulants ( [ nlye ] ) to moments , average these over @xmath47 , and then convert these back to cumulants for experimental comparison .    for the one - point case ,",
    "this convoluted route becomes simple : the @xmath24-th order one - point cumulant @xmath52 , given by @xmath53 is independent of position @xmath47 so that translational averaging is trivial .",
    "the only remaining complication is that @xmath14 is not an experimental observable , and this is easily addressed by looking at cumulant ratios @xmath54 for which the @xmath14-dependence cancels",
    ". ratios of translationally averaged one - point cumulants , @xmath55 being independent of @xmath14 , should hence be directly comparable to experiment .    to demonstrate the quality of these cumulant ratios , we consider three model distributions , all with factorised splitting function @xmath56 namely a binomial distribution ( often also termed the `` @xmath57 model '' ) , @xmath58 with parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 , a log - normal distribution @xmath61\\ ] ] with parameter @xmath62 , and a beta distribution @xmath63 with parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the beta model is particularly appealing because it parallels the experimental situation where energy conservation in three dimensions results in a non - energy - conserving one - dimensional projection .",
    "parameter values quoted are the result of requiring @xmath66 and best fits needed to reproduce observed multiplier statistics @xcite , which hence can not distinguish between these three models .",
    "as shown in figure  4 , all three splitting functions also have almost identical multifractal scaling exponents @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath66 by construction , @xmath68 is zero for all three distributions .",
    "for @xmath69 we get @xmath70 for the first two distributions and @xmath71 for the beta distribution , indistinguishable within the uncertainty of the experimental intermittency exponent @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we secondly note that even for @xmath73 the @xmath74 s for the binomial and the beta distributions remain indistinguishable .",
    "thirdly , all three distributions have a positive skewness @xmath75 when measured in @xmath76 and reproduce the observed multiplier statistics , including their correlations .",
    "this has been shown for the binomial and log - normal in ref .",
    "@xcite . numerical analysis of the beta distribution yields similar results .",
    "fits to observed scaling exponents have not been performed because it is not straightforward to compare theoretical and experimental scaling exponents due to the finiteness of the inertial range @xcite .",
    "the above observables thus fail manifestly to distinguish between the different model distributions .",
    "by contrast , figure  5 demonstrates that , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 are almost identical for the three models , higher - order cumulants and cumulant ratios ( [ rstg ] ) are very different . for example , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the distributions ( [ rstj ] ) , ( [ rstk ] ) and ( [ rstl ] ) respectively , so that the theoretical cumulant ratios @xmath82 lead to results that differ even in sign . if the present model assumptions are adequate , this sign difference should be seen in the experimental ratio @xmath83 in fourth order , the same - lineage cumulant @xmath84 has a different sign for the binomial and beta distribution , so that the ratios @xmath85 of two - point cumulants come with a different sign , too . for the log - normal distribution ,",
    "these ratios are of course again zero .",
    "having demonstrated the advantages of measuring ratios of one - point cumulants , we now consider equivalent two - point ratios .",
    "the theoretical two - point cumulant for two bins is found in terms of their mutual ultrametric distance @xmath86 . as illustrated @xcite in figure  6 , two bins @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with @xmath89 ,",
    "are separated by an ultrametric distance @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 again we must restore translational invariance using ( [ rstd ] ) for theoretical densities @xmath92 rather than ( [ rste ] ) for cumulants . in",
    "doing so , we must note that , since the density @xmath93 factorises when bins @xmath47 and @xmath94 belong to independent cascades , i.e.  whenever @xmath95 , the averaged moment splits up , @xmath96 analytic expressions for @xmath97 are again readily derived by inserting the cumulants ( [ rstf ] ) and ( [ twpb ] ) into the usual relations between @xmath24-variate moments and cumulants @xcite and thence into ( [ twpc ] ) .",
    "since the cumulants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are independent of @xmath47 , this procedure clearly involves summation of @xmath98 over @xmath47 as in ( [ twpb ] ) to create `` geometrical coefficients '' of @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the type @xmath99 with @xmath100 , where the dependence of the ultrametric distance @xmath101 on the bin positions is made explicit .",
    "these coefficients are best evaluated by changing the index of of summation , @xmath102 with @xmath103 the ( normalised ) histogram function counting the number of times @xmath101 appears while @xmath47 runs over its allowed values .",
    "empirically , we find @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the ceiling of @xmath106 . insertion of ( [ twpg ] ) into ( [ twpf ] ) leads to analytical expressions for the geometrical coefficients @xmath107 which in turn yield analytical results for the averaged two - point densities @xmath108 of ( [ twpc ] ) .",
    "spatially homogeneous two - point cumulants are then constructed via the inversion formulae @xcite @xmath109 with eqs .",
    "( [ twpc])([twphc ] ) , we arrive for @xmath110 at @xmath111 this turns out to be equivalent to direct translational averaging of cumulants ( [ rste ] ) . for @xmath112 , however , such direct averaging is wrong and the full conversion from cumulant to moment to averaged moment and back to averaged cumulant is unavoidable .",
    "for @xmath113 we get , for example , @xmath114 ^ 2         \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the additional terms are a consequence of the third term in the expression ( [ twpjd ] ) for @xmath115 . averaged two - point cumulants @xmath116 of higher order @xmath117 exhibit similar structures .",
    "translationally averaged @xmath24-point cumulants @xmath118 can be calculated by the procedure sketched above .",
    "figure 7 shows explicit examples for @xmath119 and @xmath120 for a cascade of length @xmath121 . as expected , @xmath119 reflects the trivial dependence of the splitting cumulant on the sum limits @xmath122 , apart from the point @xmath123 for which no splitting cumulant enters at all .",
    "more interesting is the coefficient for the same - lineage cumulant , @xmath120 : it consists of a series of straight - line segments , changing slope whenever @xmath124 and ending at zero for @xmath125 .",
    "since the form of @xmath120 changes whenever @xmath126 is a power of 2 , approximate exponential behaviour of @xmath127 as a function of @xmath126 is to be expected ; this is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the exponential form would , however , be destroyed by any sizeable contribution of @xmath119 entering via the splitting cumulant , especially at larger @xmath126 .",
    "the form of @xmath120 can be further understood by considering an alternative formulation for @xmath103 in terms of @xmath128 , @xmath129 ( with @xmath130 the kronecker delta and @xmath131 whenever @xmath132 and 1 otherwise ) since , with @xmath133 , we find @xmath134 which is a sum of straight - line contributions kicking in whenever @xmath126 becomes smaller than @xmath135 this means that whenever @xmath126 becomes smaller than some dyadic fraction of @xmath136 , the two bins @xmath47 and @xmath45 can fall within the same @xmath137-scale subcascade so that @xmath120 picks up new contributions from this scale",
    ".    translationally invariant cumulants @xmath138 are constructed from these factors according to eqs.([twpk])([twpl ] ) .",
    "figure  9 shows by example @xmath139 for the binomial ( @xmath57 model ) and the corresponding energy - conserving @xmath140-model with pdf @xmath141        \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ ; \\times\\ ; \\delta(q_l + q_r - 2 ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] setting ( for purposes of comparison ) @xmath142 .",
    "the @xmath57-model has @xmath143 and hence contains no contribution from @xmath119 but only from @xmath120 and @xmath144 ^ 2 = 0.1795 $ ] , while for the @xmath140-model both @xmath145 and @xmath78 contribute in ( [ twpk ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath140-model @xmath139 has the same peak at @xmath123 as the @xmath57-model but exhibits the familiar anticorrelation ( negative cumulant ) at larger @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "whether and for what @xmath126 the @xmath139 is negative depends , however , on the sum of same - side and splitting cumulant contributions rather than on the splitting cumulant alone .",
    "we further note that _ all _ models whose splitting function factorises have zero translationally invariant two - point cumulants for @xmath146 .",
    "roughly , this can be translated into the statement that deviations of two - point cumulants from zero for `` long '' distances @xmath126 ( compared to an admittedly fluctuating cascade size which we have modelled as a constant @xmath34 ) would signal the nonfactorisation of the splitting function and vice versa .    returning to cumulant ratios , we focus on cumulants @xmath147 .",
    "if the splitting function factorises as in ( [ rsth ] ) , then the splitting cumulant @xmath29 is zero and the two - point cumulant for @xmath148 , becomes directly proportional to the geometrical coefficient @xmath149 , @xmath150 taking ratios of two - point cumulants of different orders , @xmath151 the geometrical coefficient drops out , so that these ratios become independent of @xmath126 .",
    "this is an important observation as it grants access to properties of the pdf ( cascade generator ) even after spatial homogeneity has been restored .",
    "also , the @xmath126-independence of these ratios constitutes a severe test of the model assumptions entering the cascade models .",
    "furthermore , the factorisation assumption can be tested since one- and two - point ratios are equal if ( [ rsth ] ) holds , @xmath152 in this case , @xmath153 would assume the same numerical values as those in eq .",
    "( [ rstm ] ) , with similar powers to discriminate between models .",
    "two - point cumulant ratios would hence also predict clearly different results , in contrast with scaling exponents and multiplier distributions .",
    "we also note that the connection @xcite between the multifractal scaling exponents @xmath154 and the cumulant branching generating function ( [ nlyd ] ) , @xmath155 implies that the same - lineage cumulants ( [ nlyf ] ) , which are to be extracted from ratios ( [ rstg ] ) or ( [ twpp ] ) , are related to the @xmath74 by @xmath156 i.e.  the cumulant @xmath28 in @xmath30 is related to the @xmath24-th derivative of the scaling exponent @xmath157 , taken at @xmath158 . in principle , this not only allows for an unambiguous , albeit indirect extraction of scaling exponents , but also of the more fundamental splitting function .",
    "we end on an interesting sideline regarding the detection of scaling in the bin size @xmath159 .",
    "conventionally , this is done by plotting @xmath160 against @xmath161 in the expectation of seeing a straight line .",
    "the same scaling of @xmath162 is just as easily detected by pointing out that the one - point cumulant in @xmath0 is given at every scale @xmath9 by @xmath163 and , since @xmath164 , @xmath165 in other words , scaling in @xmath166 is manifest in a logarithmic dependence on the length scale @xmath167 of the corresponding one - point cumulant in @xmath0 .",
    "it must be remembered , though , that such `` forward '' scaling behaviour can be destroyed by the processes of translational averaging as well as the experimental `` backward '' box summation @xcite .",
    "we have shown that features of the analytical solution for cumulants in @xmath0 can be preserved beyond the complication of translational invariance , and in the process elucidated the interplay between the same - lineage and splitting cumulants generated at each cascade splitting on the one hand , and the geometrical features on the other .",
    "we are , of course , tempted to apply two - point cumulants of @xmath0 directly to the experimental energy dissipation field deduced from hot - wire time series and to study possible dependences on the reynolds number and the flow configuration .",
    "this may be done in the spirit of naive discovery .",
    "we do think , however , that studies of different model assumptions such as continuous multiplicative cascade processes @xcite , hierarchical shell models @xcite , effects of finite inertial range etc .",
    "should sensibly be undertaken before taking the comparison with data too seriously . +",
