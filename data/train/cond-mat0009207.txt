    "in recent years , the growing attention was paid to the so - called _ quantum chaos _ , ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . nowadays , this term is used in very different situations and often leads to a kind of confusion . to clarify the subject",
    ", one needs to remind that the origin of this term relates to quantum systems which , first , have the well - defined classical limit , and second , in this limit the corresponding classical system is assumed to manifest strong chaotic properties .",
    "one should stress that systems under consideration are dynamical ones ( or , the same , there are no random parameters in their description ) .",
    "therefore , this term was used in relation to the problem of the quantum - classical correspondence for dynamically chaotic systems .",
    "later , it was discovered that distinctive properties of _ quantum chaos _",
    "( properties of quantum systems with the dynamical chaos in the classical limit ) are generic for many other physical systems . for this reason ,",
    "on recent conferences and workshops on _ quantum chaos _ there were many talks devoted to specific problems in atomic and nuclear physics , molecular and solid state physics , optics and acoustics etc .    in order to classify the subject",
    ", we suggest to use global terms _ quantum complexity _ and _ wave chaos_. the first term refers quantum systems with complex behavior ( or complex properties of spectrum and eigenstates ) , both with and without the classical limit ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , we stress that properties of complex quantum systems may have generic features , although the mechanism can be different . in the case of",
    "_ quantum chaos _ the mechanism is closely related to the deterministic classical chaos , in contrast to quantum systems without the classical limit , where the mechanism of _ complexity _ is either due to a disorder ( _ disordered chaos _ ) or due to dynamical reasons ( quite complex interactions , although dynamical ones ) . as for the _ wave chaos _ , it refers to the chaotic properties of classical systems described by wave equations which are similar to the quantum schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore , many properties of such classical systems have much in common with those of _ quantum chaos _ and _ quantum disorder_. there are many physical situations in electrodynamics , optics , acoustics , etc .",
    ", where chaotic properties of systems are well described by the methods developed in the study of _ quantum complexity_.    below we discuss generic features of complex quantum systems , both dynamical and random ones , paying the main attention to the structure of strength functions and chaotic eigenstates . in what follows we consider the models of isolated systems of interacting particles which can be represented as a sum of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath0 and the interaction @xmath1 , @xmath2 here @xmath0 describes finite number of non - interacting particles or quasi - particles .",
    "the term @xmath1 stands for a _ two - body interaction _ between the particles , and it is assumed to be responsible for chaotic properties of the total hamiltonian @xmath3 . for disordered models the interaction @xmath1 is random by assumption , however , the two - body nature of an interaction leads to important restrictions for chaos , see below . for dynamical systems the mechanism of chaos is not obvious , however , it is known to be related to classical chaos , if the classical limit exists . as for dynamical quantum systems without classical limit , this case is less studied , however , the knowledge of properties of _ quantum chaos _ and _ disordered chaos _ helps very much .",
    "we would like to stress that both the hamiltonian @xmath0 and interaction @xmath1 can be integrable ( for dynamical systems ) , however , the total hamiltonian @xmath3 may reveal strong chaotic properties .",
    "such a separation of a total hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) into two parts is common in the description of complex atoms and nuclei and is known as the  mean field approximation  .",
    "the core of this approximation is to choose such a basis in which regular part of the total hamiltonian is absorbed in @xmath0 thus resulting in new single - particle states ( quasi - particles ) .",
    "in contrast , the _ residual interaction _",
    "@xmath1 accumulates all other terms which can not be embedded into @xmath0 due to their very complicated structure .",
    "we note that the choice of the mean field is not well - defined procedure , however , one can expect that if the most regular features of a system are described by @xmath0 , main results are not very sensitive to a specific choice of the mean field .",
    "in the limit case of a very strong and  chaotic  interaction @xmath4 , it is naturally to assume that system may be approximately represented by a completely random matrix of a given symmetry , this idea was in the origin of the _ random matrix theory _ ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . giving correct predictions for statistical fluctuations of energy levels of complex physical systems , such as heavy nuclei and highly excited many - electron atoms , full random matrices are too general and can not describe global properties of physical systems such as dependencies on the energy , strength of interaction , number of interacting particles etc .",
    "it is interesting to note that one of the first random matrix models studied in 1955 by wigner ( @xcite ) has more complicated form in comparison with full random matrices . in analogy with ( [ h ] ) , it consists of two parts , one of which is diagonal matrix with increasing entries @xmath5 and",
    "another is a band matrix @xmath6 with random elements inside the band , @xmath7 in original papers @xcite the  unperturbed spectrum  was taken in the form of  picked fence ",
    ", @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the spacing between two close energies and @xmath10 is a running integer number , however , more generic case corresponds to random values @xmath11 with the mean spacing @xmath9 , reordered in an increasing way ( @xmath12 is the delta - function ) . as for off - diagonal matrix elements",
    "@xmath6 , they are assumed to be random and independent variables inside the band @xmath13 , with the zero mean and given variance , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . outside the band , the matrix elements equal to zero .",
    "thus , the control parameters of this model are the ratio @xmath16 of a typical matrix element to the mean spacing , and the band - width @xmath17 .",
    "as one can see , the first term in ( [ wbrm ] ) corresponds to the `` mean field '' @xmath0 and the fact that the interaction has a finite energy range is directly taken into account .    in spite of impressive results of the rmt in many different applications",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , standard random matrix ensembles suffer from the lack of information about the nature of interparticle interaction . for this reason a new kind of random models",
    "was suggested in @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) ; for a long time they were forgotten and recently they have again attracted much attention in the connection with the onset of chaos due to inter - particle interaction ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "standard model of this kind describes @xmath18 interacting particles which can occupy @xmath19 single - particle states ( _ orbitals _ ) , for fermi - particles it has the form @xmath20 here matrix elements @xmath21 of the perturbation @xmath22stand for a _ two - body interaction _ ( indices @xmath23 indicate initial @xmath24 and final @xmath25 single - particle states coupled by this interaction ) , and @xmath26 is the energy of a single - particle state @xmath27 .",
    "creation - annihilation operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 define the many - particle basis @xmath30 of non - interacting particles , in which the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath31 is diagonal .",
    "it is convenient to reorder this basis according to an increase of the unperturbed energy @xmath32 with an increase of the index @xmath33 . in the _ two - body random interaction _ ( tbri ) model all matrix elements @xmath21 are assumed to be random independent variables . in realistic applications such as complex atoms and nuclei , matrix elements of the two - body interaction",
    "are calculated directly by using a proper mean field approximation , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the tbri model is very useful for the study of the role of a two - body interaction , as well as for establishing generic properties of _ quantum complexity _ , such as the localization , onset of chaos and thermalization in closed systems . to compare with _ wigner band random matrices _ ( wbrm ) of the type ( [ wbrm ] ) , one should stress the following . having globally a band - like structure ,",
    "the matrix @xmath34 defined by ( [ tbre ] ) has many zero off - diagonal matrix elements inside the band , even in the extreme case when there are no additional integrals of motions and dynamical constraints , therefore , when all single - particle states are coupled by the ( two - body ) interaction .",
    "for @xmath35 the ratio of the number of non - zero matrix elements @xmath6 to the total number of matrix elements is very small , therefore , the matrix turns out to be very sparse .",
    "moreover , non - zero off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath34 have been found @xcite to be slightly correlated , in spite of the complete randomness of two - body matrix elements .",
    "the latter fact results in specific correlations between chaotic compound states and may lead to non - statistical behavior of physical systems with completely random two - body interaction even in the region where conventional statistical description is assumed to be valid , see details in @xcite .",
    "the tbri model ( [ tbre ] ) allows both to study the conditions for the onset of chaos and thermalization in closed systems , and to relate chaotic properties of spectra and eigenstates in many - particle basis to the properties of single - particle operators .",
    "one of important results obtained recently @xcite in the frame of this model is the anderson - like transition which occurs in the hilbert space determined by many - particle states of @xmath0 .",
    "the critical value @xmath36 for this transition is determined by the density of states @xmath37 of those basis states which are directly coupled be a two - body interaction .",
    "the point that the interaction should be compared not with the total density of states @xmath38 of @xmath0 but with @xmath39 for the first time was noted in @xcite when considering specific model of a rotating nuclei ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "when the interaction is very weak , @xmath40 , exact eigenstates are delta - like functions in the unperturbed basis , with a very small admixture of other components which can be found by the standard perturbation theory . with an increase of the interaction , the _ number of principal components _ @xmath41 increases and can be very large , @xmath42 . however ,",
    "if the interaction is still not too strong , @xmath43 , @xcite , the eigenstates are sparse , with extremely large fluctuations of components . in order to have _ ergodic eigenstates _ which fill some energy range ( see below ) , one needs to have the perturbation large enough , @xmath44(for a large number of particles this transition is sharp and , in fact , one needs the weaker condition , @xmath45 ) .",
    "in order to characterize global properties of ergodic eigenstates , it is convenient to introduce the @xmath46_function _",
    "@xmath47 which gives the envelope of eigenstates , @xmath48 here @xmath49 are components of exact eigenstates @xmath50 of the total hamiltonian @xmath3 expressed in terms of basis states @xmath51 of @xmath0 , @xmath52 , and the bar stands for the average inside small windows centered at @xmath10 or @xmath18 .",
    "we use here the notations which refer low indices to the basis states , and upper indices to the exact ( compound ) eigenstates .",
    "thus , the structure of eigenstates is given by the dependence @xmath53 on @xmath10 for fixed values of @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , if we fix the index @xmath10 and explore the dependence @xmath54 on @xmath18 , one can find how the unperturbed state @xmath55 is coupled to other basis states due to interaction .",
    "the latter quantity is very important since it gives the information about the spread of the energy , initially concentrated in a specific basis state @xmath56 over other basis states , when switching on the interaction .",
    "the envelope of this function @xmath57 in the energy representation is related the _ strength function _ or _ local spectral density of states _ ( ldos ) which can be defined as follows , @xmath58 the sum is taken over a number of eigenstates @xmath59 chosen from a small energy window centered at the energy @xmath60 .",
    "one can see that this function @xmath61 is originated from the same matrix @xmath62 which gives the structure of eigenstates , therefore , the shapes of strength functions and eigenstates are related to each other .",
    "normalized to the mean energy level spacing , the strength function @xmath63 determines an effective number @xmath41 of principal components of compound states @xmath64 which are present in the basis state @xmath55 .    for the first time",
    "the form of the ldos for wbrm ( [ wbrm ] ) has been analyzed in ref .",
    "it was found that the form of the strength function essentially depends on one parameter @xmath65 only .",
    "wigner analytically proved @xcite that for relatively strong perturbation , @xmath66 , in the limit @xmath67 the form of the ldos is the lorentzian ,    @xmath68    which nowadays is known as the _ breit - wigner _ ( bw ) dependence . here",
    "the energy @xmath69 refers to the center of the distribution .",
    "the _ spreading width _",
    "@xmath70 ( half - width of the distribution ( [ bw ] ) ) is given by the famous expression , @xmath71    in other limit @xmath72 the influence of the unperturbed part @xmath73 can be neglected and the shape of the ldos  tends to the shape of density of states of band random matrix @xmath1 , which is known to be the semicircle .",
    "recently , wigner s results have been extended in @xcite to matrices @xmath74 with a general form of @xmath1 , when the variance of off - diagonal matrix elements decreases smoothly with the distance @xmath75 from the principal diagonal . in this case the effective band size @xmath76 is defined by the second moment of the envelope function @xmath77 .",
    "another important generalization of the wbrm studied in @xcite , is an additional sparsity of the matrix @xmath1 , which may mimic realistic hamiltonians .",
    "random matrix models of the type ( [ wbrm ] ) are very useful for the understanding some important properties of the ldos .",
    "let us , first , write the condition for the ldos to be of the bw form @xcite , @xmath78 the left part of this relation refers to the non - perturbative character of the interaction , according to which many of unperturbed basis states are strongly coupled by an interaction . on the other hand , the interaction should be not very strong , namely , the width @xmath70 determined by eq.([bwgam ] ) , has to be less than the width @xmath79 of the interaction in energy representation .",
    "the latter condition is generic for systems with finite range of the interaction @xmath1 .",
    "one should also stress that , strictly speaking , the bw form is not correct for such systems since its second moment diverges . as was shown in @xcite , outside the energy range latexmath:[$%    than pure exponent .",
    "for other models , such as the tbri model where the band width @xmath17 of the interaction is not well - defined , instead of @xmath81 it is more convenient to use another important quantity , the variance @xmath82 of the ldos . the latter quantity can be rigorously expressed through off - diagonal matrix elements of the interaction , @xmath83 for @xmath84 , therefore , @xmath85 for the model ( [ wbrm ] ) . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath86 and eq.([range1 ] ) can be written as @xmath87 numerical data @xcite for the wbrm and tbri models show that on the border @xmath88 the form of the ldos is quite close to the gaussian , and this transition from the bw dependence to the gaussian - like turns out to be quite sharp .",
    "one should note that the form of the ldos determines the dynamics of wave packets in the energy representation , see the data for the wbrm in ref.@xcite .",
    "for a long time it was assumed that in real physical systems the ldos has the universal bw - dependence ( [ bw ] ) . however , when studying the structure of the ldos  and eigenfunctions of the ce atom , it was observed clear deviation from the bw - shape .",
    "moreover , recent numerical investigation of nuclear shell models @xcite has shown that the form of the ldos is much closer to the gaussian rather that to the bw .",
    "this fact is due to a quite strong interaction @xmath89 since the mean field @xmath0 often includes a large regular part of the interaction , thus leaving a `` disordered part '' ( _ residual interaction_@xmath90 in @xmath1 .    as one can see , it is of great importance to find an analytical description of the ldos in dependence of the strength of interaction .",
    "although the extreme limit of a very strong interaction , @xmath91 ( or , the same , @xmath92 ) has been studied by wigner in the wbrm model ( [ wbrm ] ) , the semicircle form of the ldos seems to be unphysical .",
    "indeed , this form is originated from the semicircle dependence of the total density @xmath93 , and the latter is known to be an artifact of the standard rmt . as was shown quite long ago",
    "( see the review @xcite and reference therein ) , this result formally corresponds to random @xmath94body interaction between fermi or bose particles with @xmath95 on the other hand , physical interaction is typically of a two - body nature , this fact is directly taken into account in tbri models of the type ( [ tbre ] ) .    it is clear that analytical treatment of the tbri models is much more difficult in comparison with full and band random matrices . for this reason ,",
    "numerical data are very important since they may give a hint for rigorous results to be proved analytically ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the form of the ldos  in the tbri model ( [ tbre ] ) in the extreme case when @xmath0 can be neglected , is also defined by the density of states @xmath96 associated with the random two - body interaction @xmath1 . as was shown in @xcite , for large number of particles and orbitals , @xmath97 , the density of states @xmath96 has the gaussian form .",
    "this result is expected from the point of view of combinatorics , however , the rigorous proof is non - trivial .    using general result of the wbrm model ,",
    "see eq.([range2 ] ) , one can expect that if the spreading width @xmath98 , determined by the density @xmath99 of directly coupled basis states , larger than the `` width '' @xmath100 of the ldos , @xmath101 the form of the ldos approaches the gaussian .",
    "as is indicated above , the variance @xmath82 of the ldos is defined by the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath102 and can be found analytically ( see details in @xcite ) , @xmath103 it turns out that for fermi - particles the variance of the ldos is independent of the index @xmath10 ( therefore , of the total energy @xmath104 ) , in contrast to the models with bose - particles , for this reason in what follows we omit the index @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "one can see that with an increase of the interaction , the half - width @xmath107 of the ldos changes from the quadratic dependence @xmath108 to the linear one , @xmath109 .",
    "sometime , this fact is missing in the analysis of the tbri models .",
    "it is important to stress that in the case of @xmath110 the parameter @xmath111 has nothing to do with the half - width @xmath107 of the ldos , the latter is proportional to @xmath112 ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , the form of the ldos for the tbri model ( [ tbre ] ) was analytically found @xcite in general form .",
    "since the density of states @xmath113 strongly depends on the energy , one should take it into account explicitly , @xmath114",
    ". here , @xmath115 is the @xmath46function discussed above , written in the energy representation , @xmath116 is the total energy ( energy of an exact state @xmath117 of @xmath3 ) , and @xmath118 is the unperturbed energy ( energy of the basis state @xmath119 of @xmath0 .",
    "the method used in @xcite , is an extension of the approach developed in @xcite , which takes into account specific structure of the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath120 was found to have the form ,    @xmath121    with some function @xmath122 . in the case of a relatively weak interaction , @xmath123 ,",
    "the function @xmath122 is almost constant on the scale of the energy width @xmath81 , therefore , the conventional bw - expression ( [ bw ] ) is recovered for @xmath120 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of strong interaction , @xmath124 , the dependence of @xmath125 on the energy @xmath126 can not be neglected and the nominator in ( [ ffbw ] ) is the leading one .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the function @xmath122 is defined by the density of states for one - body and two - body transitions , and for large number of particles and orbitals has the gaussian form with the variance @xmath106 .",
    "detailed numerical study @xcite of the form of the ldos in the region @xmath127 have shown that the ldos  coincides with the gaussian with a very high accuracy .",
    "it is important to stress that the condition for the existence of a smooth energy dependence @xmath128 is defined by the condition @xmath45 of ergodicity for the components @xmath129 of the ldos ( or , the same , for exact eigenstates ) .",
    "below this transition , for @xmath130 , the smooth solution of the equation for the function @xmath122 does not exist . in this sense , the result obtained in @xcite can be treated as the independent proof of the onset of chaos in the tbri model when @xmath45 .",
    "having formal solution ( [ ffbw ] ) for the ldos , it is , however , convenient to find a simple phenomenological expression which depends on two control parameters only , the width @xmath111 defined by ( [ lam ] ) , and the width @xmath106 , see eq.([sigma ] ) .",
    "this was recently done in @xcite where both the wbrm and tbri models have been used to compare numerical data with the following expression , @xmath131 here @xmath132 is the normalized energy which refers to the center of the ldos , with @xmath106 given by ( [ sigma ] ) . taking the parameter @xmath133 as the fitting parameter",
    ", two other parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 are determined from the normalization conditions @xmath136 and @xmath137 . as one can see , in the normalized energy units",
    "there is only one control parameter @xmath138 . in the region",
    "@xmath139 the bw - dependence for @xmath140 is recovered , and for @xmath141 the gaussian emerges , see details in @xcite .",
    "numerical data show that this dependence gives quite good description of the ldos for any values of @xmath138 defined by @xmath111 and @xmath106 .",
    "it turns out that the transition from the bw - dependence to the gaussian is quite sharp and takes place when @xmath142 ( see also recent numerical data @xcite ) .",
    "the above phenomenological expression ( [ fit ] ) with the fitting function @xmath143@xmath144 is quite useful in the applications .",
    "so far , we have discussed the form of the ldos , provided the eigenstates are chaotic in the sense that the fluctuations of their components @xmath145 around the smooth envelope given by @xmath146 are gaussian - like .",
    "similar analysis can be performed for the form @xmath147of exact compound eigenstates in the unperturbed energy representation . as was noted above , these two functions , @xmath146 and @xmath148 are related to each other through the matrix @xmath62 , see eq.([w ] ) .",
    "analytical estimates @xcite for the tbri model show that for not very strong interaction , when @xmath149 with @xmath150 as the total width of the energy spectrum of @xmath0 , the two functions are close to each other .",
    "this fact allows to use the results obtained for the ldos , when considering typical structure of exact eigenstates .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath46function is very important for the relation of chaotic properties of the hamiltonian @xmath3 in the many  body representation , with the properties of single - particle operators . indeed , exact eigenstates @xmath151 of the total hamiltonian @xmath3 are given as     _",
    "@xmath152 _ where _ @xmath129 _ is the @xmath153 component of the compound state _ @xmath154 _ in the unperturbed basis .",
    "these coefficients @xmath155 determine the so - called _ occupation numbers _",
    "@xmath156 ,    @xmath157    where @xmath158 stands for the occupation number operator .",
    "this quantity gives the probability that one of @xmath18 particles occupies an orbital @xmath159 specified by the one - particle state @xmath160 for the fixed exact state @xmath161 . according to this expression ,",
    "this probability can be found by projecting the state @xmath162 onto the basis of unperturbed states , for which the relation between the positions of all particles in the single - particle basis and the specific many - particle basis state is known by the construction of the latter .",
    "one can see that the probability @xmath163 is the sum of probabilities over a number of basis states which construct the exact state . for fermi - particles the occupation number @xmath164 is equal to @xmath165or @xmath166 depending on whether any of the particles in the basis state @xmath119 occupies or not the single - particle state @xmath167 .    for chaotic eigenstates",
    "the @xmath168distribution is a fluctuating function of the total energy @xmath169 of a system , due to strong ( gaussian ) fluctuations of the components @xmath129 . in order to obtain a smooth dependence",
    ", one should make an average over a small energy window centered at @xmath170 , which is in the spirit of the conventional statistical mechanics for systems in the contact with thermostat .",
    "in fact , such an average is a kind of microcanonical averaging since it is done for the fixed total energy @xmath126 of a system .",
    "therefore , one can define the @xmath168_distribution _ through the @xmath171 see ( [ w ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) , @xmath172    the @xmath168 distribution plays essential role in the statistical approach to finite systems of interaction particles , see details in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that non - trivial part in the above expression for @xmath156 is the @xmath173function @xmath174 which absorbs statistical effects of the two - body interaction @xmath1 .",
    "the important point is that in order to find the distribution of occupation numbers , one needs to know the envelope of exact eigenstates in the basis ( or energy ) representation , not the eigenstates themselves .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the @xmath46function and the density of states @xmath175 of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath0 ( it appears when passing from the summation to the integration in eq.([nsav ] ) ) gives us the possibility to relate global properties of eigenstates to the distribution of occupation numbers of single  particle states .",
    "the form of @xmath176 in the tbri  model ( [ tbre ] ) has been studied in detail in connection with the problem of thermalization and of the onset of fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution .",
    "it should be stressed that the occurrence of the fd - distribution in closed systems of finite number of interacting particles is far from being trivial , especially , when the number @xmath18 of particles is not very large .",
    "it has to be noted that in many applications @xmath18 is the number of particles ( quasi - particles ) above the fermi level , therefore , it can be relatively small .",
    "for example , in the mean field description of the ce atom there are @xmath177 interacting electrons in the outer shell @xcite , and @xmath178 in the standard @xmath179 shell model of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting results obtained in the frame of the tbri model ( [ tbre ] ) is that the fd - distribution may occur even for 4 interacting fermi - particles , provided the ( random ) interaction @xmath22is strong enough . in this case one can obtain an analytical expression for the temperature and chemical potential which stand in the standard fermi - dirac form for the occupation number distribution @xmath156 .",
    "another important result is that even if the form of the @xmath168distribution is far from the fd - distribution , it can be described analytically , the simplest case is when the form of the @xmath46function is close to the gaussian .",
    "the study of the @xmath180distribution allows to determine the onset of thermalization in terms of the ergodicity of components of compound states in the energy range defined by the @xmath46function .",
    "in fact , the ergodicity of eigenstates results in standard ( gaussian - like ) fluctuations , both for components of eigenstates around the envelope ( @xmath46function ) and for the @xmath156 numbers , when changing slightly the total energy of a system ( see details in @xcite ) . the latter property ( existence of a smooth dependence of the @xmath168distribution with gaussian fluctuations around this dependence ) is , in essence , the existence of a statistical equilibrium for interacting particles in a closed system .",
    "one of the important questions is the quantum - classical correspondence for the _ shape of eigenstates _ ( se ) and the ldos .",
    "as was pointed out in ref.@xcite , there is quite simple approach for finding _ classical shape of eigenstates _ and _ classical ldos .",
    "_ this approach is generic and can be used for different physical models @xcite .",
    "let us start with the classical se .",
    "we consider the total hamiltonian in the form ( [ h ] ) where the `` unperturbed part '' @xmath0 can be represented as the sum of single - particles hamiltonians @xmath181 describing the motion of @xmath18 non - interacting particles , @xmath182 .",
    "the interaction @xmath1 between the particles is assumed to result in a chaotic behavior of the system @xmath3 .",
    "now let us fix the _ total _ energy @xmath183 of the hamiltonian @xmath184 and find ( numerically ) the trajectory @xmath185 by computing hamiltonian equations . since the total hamiltonian @xmath3 is chaotic , any choice of initial conditions @xmath186 gives the same result if one computes the trajectory for a sufficiently large time .",
    "when time is running , let us collect the values of the _ unperturbed _ hamiltonian @xmath187 at fixed times @xmath188 and construct the distribution of energies @xmath189 along chaotic trajectory of the _ total _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath3 . in this way",
    "one can obtain the distribution @xmath190 . comparing with the quantum model",
    ", one can see that this function @xmath191 is the classical analog of the average shape of eigenstates in the energy representation .",
    "indeed , any exact eigenstate corresponds to a fixed total energy @xmath192 and it is represented in the unperturbed basis of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , one can expect that for chaotic eigenstates in a deep semiclassical region the two above quantities , classical and quantum ones , correspond to each other .    in the same way one can consider the complimentary situation .",
    "let us fix the _ unperturbed _ energy @xmath193 and compute the trajectory @xmath194 which belongs to the _ unperturbed _ hamiltonian @xmath195 similar to the previous case , let us put this unperturbed trajectory into the total hamiltonian @xmath184 and collect the values of the total energy @xmath196 along the unperturbed trajectory for discrete values of time .",
    "it allows us to find the distribution @xmath197 which now should be compared with the ldos in the corresponding quantum model .",
    "however , in this case one should perform an average over many initial conditions @xmath198 with the same energy @xmath199 , since the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath0 is separable .",
    "one can see that the above two classical distributions @xmath200 and @xmath201 determine the ergodic measure of two energy shells , the first one , when projecting the phase space surface of @xmath202 onto @xmath0 , and the second one , when projecting the surface of @xmath73 onto @xmath3 ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the first example is the model of two interacting rotors ( see @xcite and references therein ) ,    @xmath203    with angular momentum @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "this model may be used to describe the interaction of quasi - spins in nuclear physics or pseudo  spins in solid state systems . comparing with eq.([h ] ) , here @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "the constants of motion are @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , which are connected by the relation @xmath211 for @xmath212 .",
    "it is worth to mention that in ( [ ham1 ] ) the dynamical variables @xmath213 are not canonical , however , keeping @xmath209 and @xmath214 as constants , one can present @xmath215 in the canonical variables .",
    "it is known ( see references in @xcite ) that in the classical limit the phase space consists of both regular and chaotic regions , the size of which depends on the values of @xmath209 @xmath216 and @xmath210 .",
    "we consider the simplest case @xmath217 for which trajectories are regular when @xmath218 is close to @xmath219 , and are chaotic at the center of the energy band , @xmath220 .",
    "quantization of this model can be done in the standard way , with angular momenta quantized according to the relations @xmath221 where @xmath222 is an integer number .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath223 the hamiltonian matrix is finite and the semiclassical limit corresponds to the limit @xmath224 and @xmath225 while keeping @xmath209 constant . according to the approach",
    "discussed above , the hamiltonian is represented in the two  particles basis @xmath226 ) , it is important to reorder the unperturbed basis in such a way that the energy of many - particles states of @xmath73 increases .",
    "this kind of sorting corresponds to the classical model and allows to establish quantum - classical correspondence for the shape of ldos and eigenstates .",
    "after this reordering , the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath0 has the shell structure , with the same value on energy inside one shell .",
    "diagonal matrix elements are given by the eigenvalues @xmath227 of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath0 , and diagonal elements of the perturbation @xmath1 vanish due to a particular form of the interaction .",
    "the global structure of the matrix @xmath228 is quite specific , however , it has some similarity with the tbri matrices .",
    "apart from the principal diagonal @xmath229 determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath0 , the next ( to the principal one ) diagonals @xmath230 correspond to transitions inside each @xmath0-shell while the  arcs  connecting the two corners represent transitions between neighboring shells having @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath34 has only four off - diagonal `` curves '' along which non - zero off - diagonal elements are located .",
    "all other matrix elements vanish thus resulting in extremely sparse matrix @xmath232 in spite of a clear band structure , the hamiltonian matrix @xmath34 can not be compared with wigner band random matrices of the type ( [ wbrm ] ) since its band size is not much less than the total size of the matrix .",
    "indeed , the band width is @xmath233 in the middle of the matrix , therefore , the control parameter @xmath234 is of the order 1 and the finiteness of the matrix is crucial ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also important to stress that non - zero matrix elements can not be treated as random ones since the model ( [ ham1 ] ) is dynamical .",
    "all non - zero off - diagonal matrix elements are positive and the mean and variance of the distribution of these matrix elements depend on the classical parameter @xmath235 only .    numerical data for the ldos in the center of the energy band , @xmath236 , have been obtained in the dynamical approach discussed in the previous section . more precisely , this distribution was numerically calculated taking a sample of chaotic trajectories having the same fixed values of @xmath126 and @xmath237 . following these trajectories ,",
    "one can calculate @xmath238 taken at equal instants of time and find the distribution of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the classical distribution can be also evaluated analytically since the classical unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath0 is integrable .",
    "the result is presented in fig.2 in the normal and semi - log scales .",
    "the quantum distribution eq.([ldos ] ) was obtained by averaging over @xmath239 values of individual dependencies @xmath240 for the largest shell with @xmath241 . here ,",
    "the normalized energies are used , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , with @xmath193 and @xmath126 as the unperturbed and exact energies .",
    "one can see a remarkable correspondence between the quantum ldos  and its classical counterpart . the only difference can be found in long tails of the distribution , which manifests a kind of quantum tunneling beyond the energy region given by the classical hamiltonian .",
    "also , one can notice some discrepancy at the center of the energy band , where quantum effects are also expected to be relatively strong due to a finite value of the semiclassical parameter @xmath223 .",
    "a very good correspondence has been also found for the shape of exact eigenstates se , see fig.3 .",
    "numerical procedure of the averaging was taken in the way similar to that for the ldos , with the average over @xmath239 exact eigenstates taken from the center of the energy band .",
    "again , one can see some difference in the tails and at the center of the distribution , which is caused by pure quantum effects .",
    "it should be pointed out that at the edges of the energy spectrum where the classical motion is regular , individual eigenstates differ very strongly one from the other , therefore , one needs take a relatively large number of eigenstates for the average , in order to obtain a smooth dependence on the energy .",
    "this means that although the quantum - classical correspondence can be achieved in the regular region , it has no sense since the energy interval to be taken for the average can be of the order the whole spectrum .",
    "the interesting question arises in the view of the form of the ldos , see fig.2 .",
    "one can suggest that this form is close to the breit - wigner dependence ( [ bw ] ) which generically occurs in random matrix models .",
    "however , the detailed study @xcite rejected this possibility since only in a very small energy region close to the center one can speak about a kind of the correspondence .",
    "this means that for the dynamical model of two interacting spins typical form of the ldos is neither the breit - wigner nor the gaussian .",
    "one should note that in this model there are no free parameters ( apart from the total energy ) which can change the relative strength of the interaction @xmath1 .",
    "when comparing the shape of eigenstates with the form of the ldos , see figs.2 - 3 , one can see a strong difference in the energy range associated with the width of energy shells .",
    "this fact is due to the difference in the density of states@xmath244 and @xmath245 for the unperturbed and total hamiltonians , see details in @xcite .",
    "it was , however , shown that with a proper rescaling the ldos distribution coincides with the @xmath173 function with a high accuracy .",
    "now let us consider the motion of a particle in the quasi-1d rippled billiard @xcite , see fig .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the dynamics of a classical particle in this billiard manifests generic properties of the transition to chaos with an increase of the amplitude @xmath246 for a fixed @xmath247 . a possible experimental realization of this model with _",
    "finite _ length is a mesoscopic electron wave guide . in @xcite",
    "_ classical _ transport properties of this billiard have been related to its dynamical properties , thus giving a transport signature of chaos .",
    "the analysis of the quantum motion in the _ infinitely _ long rippled channel with the periodic upper boundary @xmath248 is useful for the understanding of universal features of electronic band structures of real crystals , propagation in periodic waveguides , quantum wires and films , see references in @xcite .",
    "detailed study of the energy band structure of the quantum version of this periodic rippled channel is presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the control parameter that determines the degree of chaos in the classical model is @xmath249 , and strong chaos occurs when @xmath250 . in the quantum description one should solve the schrdinger equation @xmath251 with the boundary conditions @xmath252 at @xmath253 and @xmath254 . instead , in ref.@xcite the approach has been used which is based on the transition to the new coordinates @xmath255 , and @xmath256 , for which the boundary conditions become trivial , @xmath257 at @xmath258 . on the other hand , in the new variables",
    "the specific interaction between two degrees of freedom arises and the hamiltonian acquires a much more complicated form ,    @xmath259    which is simply the kinetic energy expressed in the covariant form .",
    "the momentum is now given by @xmath260=-i\\hbar g^{-1/4}\\partial _",
    "\\alpha g^{1/4}$ ] , where @xmath261 is the metric tensor , and @xmath262 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath263 , ( see @xcite for details ) . as a result , the original model of one particle in the rippled billiard",
    "is formally transformed into the model of two interacting particles . in this way ,",
    "the complexity of the boundary in the original model is incorporated into the `` interaction potential '' .",
    "the solution for the wave function can be represented by expanding the function @xmath264 in a double fourier series , @xmath265 where @xmath266 stands for the eigenstate of energy @xmath267 , and @xmath268 and the bloch number was fixed @xmath269 in the numerical study .",
    "the index @xmath19 refers to the mode ( or channel ) number and @xmath18 stands for the brillouin zone number . note that @xmath270 are the eigenstates of the unperturbed momenta squared ( and , therefore , of the unperturbed hamiltonian ) : @xmath271 , @xmath272",
    "one should remind that each pair @xmath273 is associated with one number @xmath274 which labels the unperturbed two - particle basis and it is essential that the unperturbed basis of @xmath0 has to be ordered in increasing energy , @xmath275 .    in the classical limit",
    "one should perform the coordinate transformation in the same way as it was done for the quantum model .",
    "the classical hamiltonian has the form @xmath276 with the same boundary conditions in @xmath277 coordinates .",
    "expanding this expression , one can obtain ,    @xmath278 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath279 , and @xmath263 .",
    "it should be noted that the transformation from the old to new variables is canonical . in accordance with the quantum model",
    ", the separation of the total hamiltonian into two parts , @xmath280 , has to be done as follows , @xmath281 ; \\,\\,\\,\\,v\\equiv h - h^0\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    let us now compare the quantum ldos and the shape of exact eigenstates with their classical counterparts which are numerically obtained @xcite in the described above approach , see fig.5 .",
    "one can see , that , in general , there is quite good global correspondence between quantum and classical data ( the role of quantum fluctuations around the envelopes will be discuss below ) .",
    "the interesting point is that the forms of the ldos and the se are highly non - trivial , if to compare with the breit - wigner or gaussian distribution .",
    "remarkably , the averaging procedure reveals a three - peak structure for both classical and quantum quantities .",
    "the origin of these peaks can be understood by a detailed analysis of the classical trajectories @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was found that even for the chaotic motion the particle can be located for a long time in the neighborhood of stable and unstable periodic orbits of period 1 .",
    "one can find that the unstable ( stable ) periodic orbit is defined by @xmath282 and @xmath283 respectively .",
    "the right peak corresponds to the motion perpendicular to the @xmath284 axis at @xmath285 ( unstable orbit ) .",
    "similarly , the left one results from the stable orbit at @xmath286 .",
    "in contrast , the central peak is originated from the trajectories which are nearly parallel to the @xmath284-axis .",
    "a similar analysis explains the origin of the structure of the classical ldos .    as for the comparison between the form of the ldos  and that of the se",
    ", it is easy to detect a difference , especially , in the central region .",
    "the reason for this is still not clear , in ref.@xcite it was suggested that it is due to the difference between time averages and phase space averages for finite times .",
    "now let us discuss the problem of localization in the energy shell . as was claimed above , with an increase of the interaction in the tbri model , the anderson - like transition",
    "is expected @xcite in the hilbert space of many - particle states .",
    "it occurs when the interaction strength @xmath287 exceeds the mean level spacing between basis states which are directly coupled by the two - body interaction , @xmath45 . in terms of the structure of compound states ,",
    "this means that above this threshold the components @xmath288 ergodically fill an available energy shell .",
    "more specifically , the fluctuations of these components fluctuate around the mean given by the @xmath173function , in accordance with the conventional statistical mechanics , typically , according to the gaussian distribution .",
    "one should stress that for closed systems the width of the energy shell is always finite due to a finite range of interaction , and it can be much less than the total size of the energy spectrum",
    ". however , the number @xmath41 of principal components can be very large . in this sense",
    ", one can rigorously define the _ onset of chaos _ ( or maximal complexity in eigenstates ) , as the ergodic filling of the energy shell with the gaussian fluctuations around the envelope given by the @xmath46function .",
    "if the system has the classical limit , the @xmath46function has its classical counterpart which can be easily found from newton equations of motion .",
    "more difficult situation is when there is no classical limit , in this case , although the @xmath46function exists , it is of the problem to find it without direct diagonalization ( and the average over a number of eigenstates ) of a ( typically huge ) hamiltonian matrix . using two examples of simple quantum dynamical models with the classical chaos ,",
    "we have shown here that in a deep semiclassical limit there is a good correspondence for the form of both the ldos and eigenstates .",
    "strange enough , this quantum - classical correspondence is studied scarcely , there are mainly numerical results discussed above ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "as the data for the rippled channel show , a kind of semiclassical periodic orbit theory can be developed both for the ldos  and se .",
    "the knowledge of the se is extremely important for the study of any kind of localization in the energy shell .",
    "the non - trivial role of the @xmath46function is that it gives a reference to which individual eigenstates should be compared in order to see the localization .",
    "let us first consider the tbri model where there is no influence of classical periodic orbits which result in a specific sort of localization ( scars , if to speak about the quantum - classical correspondence in the configuration space ) . for such kind of models , above",
    "the threshold @xmath289 the gaussian fluctuations for the coefficients @xmath145 are expected .",
    "this was checked for excited states of the ce atom which is known to be quite chaotic dynamical system @xcite .",
    "numerical data have shown , that , indeed , the fluctuations turns out to be very close to the gaussian .",
    "note , that for the study of these fluctuations , first , one needs to normalize each value @xmath145 to its mean - square - root value which itself depends on the index @xmath290 ( or on the energy @xmath170 , if to analyze the fluctuations in the energy space ) .",
    "therefore , one should find this mean value ( square root of the @xmath46function ) by a kind of the average .",
    "below the threshold @xmath289 the fluctuations of the amplitudes @xmath288 are extremely large since the components which correspond to those states , which are not coupled directly by a two  body interaction , are very small , thus resulting in a large peak in the distribution of @xmath291 around zero . as one can see , the quantum localization results in the sparsity of the @xmath46function and the ldos , in contrast to the standard anderson localization in one and quasi-1d disordered models , where eigenstates are  dense \" in the configuration space and occupy a finite number of sites ( analog of basis states in our models ) .",
    "therefore , the fingerprint of the anderson localization is an exponential decay of the amplitudes @xmath292 far from the `` centers '' of eigenstates , unlike the localization in the energy shell for closed systems , where the cut - off of tails always exists due to finiteness of the energy shell . on the other hand , for a very strong localization , when eigenstates consist of few basis states ( for @xmath40 )",
    ", the situation is quite similar to that for the anderson localization ( this typically happens for low energy states due to a relatively large values of @xmath293 ) .",
    "a much more delicate situation occurs for dynamical quantum systems with the classical limit . in this case in addition to the quantum localization , even in a strongly chaotic classical region , the influence of tiny structure of the classical phase space ( for example , short unstable periodic orbits ) may be quite important . in this sense",
    ", one can speak about the localization which is caused by both classical properties ( periodic orbits ) and quantum ones ( scarring effect ) . for this reason ,",
    "the mesoscopic region where both classical and quantum effects can be equally strong , is of the most difficult for the analysis .",
    "coming back to the numerical data for the rippled channel @xcite , a noticeable fraction of extremely localized eigenstates has been detected in the region of a strong classical chaos where typically eigenstates are ergodic .",
    "it was found that these eigenstates are originated from those basis states which are located on the edges of the shells of @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that these basis states are very slightly coupled with the others by the interaction @xmath1 .",
    "these localized states correspond to almost free motion of a particle along the channel .",
    "the presence of very localized states has been also observed in the model ( [ ham1 ] ) of two interacting spin @xcite . in this case ,",
    "their origin is not so clear and deserves an additional study .",
    "finally , we would like to raise a new problem related to the quantum - classical correspondence for chaotic classical systems .",
    "it refers to the ergodicity of _ individual _ eigenstates in a deep semiclassical region . according to the shnirelman theorem",
    ", it is believed that the closer this limit , the less influence of quantum effects .",
    "to see this fact , a kind of the average over a small energy range is typically assumed . on the other hand , in a deep semiclassical limit",
    "the eigenstates have a very large number of components .",
    "this allows one to perform the statistical analysis inside _ individual eigenstates _ , without any energy or ensemble average",
    "this is in a spirit of dynamical chaos for which statistical properties can be revealed along a single chaotic trajectory .",
    "specifically , we can ask : how fast these fluctuations approach those ones prescribed by the standard statistical mechanics ?",
    "numerical data @xcite manifest that individual eigenstates can not be rigorously treated as random ones since non - statistical deviations seem to persist for _ any finite values _ of @xmath294 . in this sense",
    ", one can speak about _ non - ergodic character _ of individual eigenstates , in spite of the existence of the classical limit itself .",
    "definitely , this question deserves a detailed study , both numerically and analytically .",
