    "are required to access the disk midplane properties .",
    "the ionization fraction @xmath9 in disks is especially important because the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , believed to drive viscous accretion , requires ionization to couple the magnetic field to the gas @xcite .",

    "the observations were carried out with the emir 330 ghz receiver , with a beam size of @xmath1595 ( fwhm ) .",

    ", we define the midplane as the region where all heavy elements are frozen out and h@xmath13 and its isotopologues are the dominant charge carriers . theoretically , the midplane temperature is limited by the freeze - out temperatures of co and n@xmath0 , since both react readily with h@xmath13 , resulting in hco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xcite . since n@xmath0 is maintained in the gas phase at slightly lower temperatures than co @xcite",
    ", the n@xmath0h@xmath1 rotational temperature provides the strongest observational limit available on the midplane temperature .      to estimate the n@xmath0h@xmath1 rotational temperature , we assume lte and co - spatial emission from the n@xmath0h@xmath1 32 and 43 lines",
    "this is a reasonable approximation because chemical models predict that n@xmath0h@xmath1 should be abundant in a narrow temperature regime between where co begins to freeze - out and n@xmath0 freeze - out is not complete @xcite .",
    "assuming optically thin emission , unity filling factor within the co 32 disk , and molecules thermalized at a single rotational temperature ,    @xmath48    from @xcite , where @xmath49 is the total number of molecules , @xmath50 is the temperature dependent partition function , @xmath51 the energy of the upper level in k , and @xmath52 the rotational temperature .",

    "the derived @xmath5 ratio is 0.50.1 for temperatures of 1020 k , with the lowest ratio at 1317  k. while the assumed grain size distribution and density are more appropriate for dense clouds than disk midplanes , the grain size distribution mainly affects the temperature profile , and @xcite find that the h@xmath0d@xmath1 @xmath5 is nearly constant with increasing density .",

    "the derived ratio is an order of magnitude above the ratio found by @xcite , who used resolved hco@xmath1 1 - 0 and single - dish dco@xmath1 2 - 1 emission and a radiative transfer calculation rather than lte .",
    "the derived disk averaged n(hco@xmath1 ) are almost identical over the inner 400  au of the disk : @xmath84 @xmath7 from their tabulated column density at 300  au and power law index , compared to @xmath85 @xmath7 calculated here assuming lte at 38  k. the different ratios must thus be due to different assumptions on the dco@xmath1 emission conditions .",
    "the hco@xmath1 column density compares well with model predictions of the outer disk ( 100400  au ) .",
    "it is for example consistent with the disk chemistry model by @xcite within a factor of 3 .",
    "@xcite observed n@xmath0h@xmath1 10 with the plateau de bure interferometer and derived n@xmath0h@xmath1/hco@xmath1 of @xmath150.020.03 .",
    "this ratio agrees well with the results in table 3 , which implies a disk - averaged ratio of 0.03 .",
    "the disk averaged n(h@xmath0 ) within each temperature regime are 15 , 2.4 , and @xmath86 @xmath7 , and these values are used with the derived ion column densities to calculate disk averaged @xmath9 in each layer .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows that the hco@xmath1 abundance and the midplane ion limits are comparable at @xmath87 n@xmath79 , while the abundance of dco@xmath1  +  n@xmath0h@xmath1 is an order of magnitude lower at @xmath88 n@xmath79 .",
    "overall , the derived ion abundances suggest a decreasing @xmath9 with depth in the disk , which might be expected from attenuation of ionizing radiation .",
    "the assumption that dco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 alone are representative for the degree of ionization in the intermediate layer may be oversimplified , however .",
    "the @xmath89 layer is a transition region where some hco@xmath1 may still be present and h@xmath13 may already have started to become important . a combination of better limits on the midplane ions as well as more detailed modeling of the intermediate layer with dco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 will be needed to confirm the depth dependent trend on @xmath9 .",
    "in the previous section the disk averaged column densities and abundances were calculated based on observed line intensities and a density and temperature structure of dm tau from the literature . this particular structure model has not been used as a basis for chemical modeling . in this section",
    "we therefore use predictions on the ion chemistry in generic disk models to compare our observational results with the current understanding of the chemical compositions in disks .",
    "model predictions on the abundances of h@xmath0d@xmath1 and other ions in protoplanetary disks have been made by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for generic t tauri disk structures .",
    "in particular , the models of @xcite include abundances and column densities for all of the ions considered in this study , and therefore we focus on comparing the observational results with these predictions .",
    "we examine specifically the disk averaged ionization fraction , the ionization fraction in different disk layers , and the relative abundances of different ions .",
    "@xcite based their chemical calculations on the disk structure model of @xcite , representing a generic t tauri disk . the assumed accretion rate , disk mass etc are within a factor of a few of the values that have been derived for dm tau @xcite .",
    "most disk chemistry predictions are therefore expected to be valid for dm tau , except for absolute ion column densities .",
    "the chemical modeling is based on the umist database , updated with multiple deuterated species @xcite . within this model framework , @xcite investigated the importance of cosmic ray desorption and photodesorption on the disk chemical abundances , which has a large effect on the ion abundance ratios .",
    "an important caveat when comparing observations and model predictions , is that @xcite presents column densities as a function of radius with no simple procedure to calculate disk averaged column densities .",
    "observations can therefore only be compared with model predictions at specific radii . from the dm tau structure model",
    "the observed emission is dominated by the outer disk ; beyond 50 au the column densities of the different temperature layers are almost constant , which entails that the larger emission region of the outer disk will dominate . in particular more than 2/3 of the ion emission",
    "is expected to originate outside of 250  au if the ions are present across the co disk . in the models by @xcite the ion column densities are constant within a factor of 2 at 100400  au , except for the relative importance of different h@xmath13 isotopologues .",
    "it is therefore useful to compare model predictions in this regime with the observed disk averaged values as long as this factor of two uncertainty is considered .",
    "@xcite provides the most complete model results at 250  au and this radius is used in all comparisons between model and observations .",
    "the main sources of ionizing radiation in disks are ultraviolet ( uv ) photons , cosmic rays , radioactive decay and x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ionization level therefore depends on a combination of the incident fluxes and the attenuation of external photons with dust and gas column density .",
    "@xcite include both the interstellar radiation field and a stellar uv field that is 500 times stronger at 100  au . because of efficient absorption by dust and h@xmath0",
    ", the uv ionization is mainly important in the disk atmosphere and upper molecular layer .",
    "cosmic rays are assumed to penetrate unperturbed to the disk midplane resulting in an ionization rate of @xmath90 s@xmath4 .",
    "radioactive decay also contributes to the midplane ionization , at a rate of @xmath91 s@xmath4 .",
    "the effect of x - rays are not included in the model and the model may therefore underestimate @xmath9 in lower disk layers .    in this model , the total ion column density ( h@xmath13 , h@xmath0d@xmath1 , d@xmath0h@xmath1 , d@xmath13 , hco@xmath1 , dco@xmath1 , n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) at 250  au is @xmath92 @xmath7 , corresponding to an average @xmath9 of @xmath93 n@xmath79 .",
    "this value is consistent with the observed abundances and limits . in the related disk model of @xcite ,",
    "the ion abundance depends on the assumed cosmic ray flux , as expected .      in disks , including the model from @xcite the temperature increases both inward and upward in the disk , resulting in a vertically layered structure outside of an inner truncation radius . in the model ,",
    "hco@xmath1 extends through the disk , while dco@xmath1 is only abundant outside of 50  au and h@xmath0d@xmath1 outside of 100  au . as mentioned above , beyond 100  au",
    "the different ion column densities are basically constant , justifying the comparison between disk averaged observations and model predictions at 250  au .    because all uv photons and probably some of the x - rays and cosmic rays are absorbed in the outer disk layers , the ionization fraction should decrease between the outer disk layers and the disk midplane . at 250",
    "au , in the disk chemistry models ( fig . 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the ion abundance in the upper molecular layer , where co is in the gas - phase and hco@xmath1 is the dominant ion , is a factor of 5 higher than in the midplane ( @xmath94 compared to @xmath95 n@xmath79 ) . in the intermediate region , where dco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundances peak , the ion abundance is about a factor of 23 below the co layer ion abundance .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the results of the analysis of the dm tau observations ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "_ hco@xmath1 and dco@xmath1 : _ the hco@xmath1 column density predicted by @xcite is @xmath96 @xmath7 at 250  au and is found to not depend on the different desorption mechanisms considered .",
    "in contrast , the dco@xmath1 column density predictions vary by an order magnitude , resulting in a dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 ratio of 0.11 .",
    "the higher dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 ratios appear with desorption through cosmic ray heating , which maintains co in the gas - phase in the disk midplane where the temperatures are low enough for efficient deuterium fractionation and enhanced dco@xmath1 production .",
    "the observations indicate that the disk averaged dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 abundance ratio is below 0.1 , which suggests that co is confined to the warm @xmath1020  k molecular layer .",
    "the observational results are consistent with including uv photodesorption , which is efficient only in the warm molecular layer .    _ n@xmath0h@xmath1 : _",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1/hco@xmath1 abundance ratio is predicted to be in the range from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , but the models with the highest values also predict dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 ratios of unity and can be excluded . compared to the value of 0.03 derived from the observations , the models are an order of magnitude too low .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is unknown , demonstrating that even the simplest nitrogen - based chemistry remains poorly constrained .",
    "_ h@xmath0d@xmath1 : _",

    "these values are well below the observational limits , and the reason is that d@xmath13 is the dominant carrier of charge in the midplane in these models , 2050 times more abundant than h@xmath0d@xmath1 . in the disk model by @xcite ,",
    "the h@xmath0d@xmath1 column density is predicted to be significantly higher , 10@xmath8 @xmath7 , likely because multiple deuteration is not considered .",
