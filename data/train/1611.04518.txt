    "the application of uniaxial strain on graphene has been studied in the tight - binding approximation by pereira and co - workers @xcite .",

    "as mentioned in the main text , in order to study the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice under uniaxial strain , the method we choose is the two - particle self - consistent approach ( tpsc ) .",
    "this nonperturbative , semi - analytical technique is valid from weak to intermediate values of interaction .",
    "initially developed as an approximation scheme to study the single - band hubbard model on the square lattice @xcite , tpsc was later extended to study the multi - band case of the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "in particular , the semi - metal to antiferromagnet transition of the half - filled hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice was studied using this method @xcite .",
    "tpsc satisfies many important physical constraints like conservation laws , pauli principle and local sum rules for spin and charge susceptibilities .",
    "most importantly , this approach obeys the mermin - wagner theorem , which prevents a finite temperature phase transition in two dimensions , while aptly capturing the physics of long wavelength antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the system .",
    "once the antiferromagnetic correlation length becomes larger than the thermal de broglie wavelength , there is a crossover to the renormalized classical regime .",
    "since the quasiparticles get destroyed by these large antiferromagnetic fluctuations , a pseudogap opens up @xcite .      in tpsc , we start with the noninteracting susceptibility and define bethe - salpeter equations for the interacting spin and charge susceptibilities .",
    "although tpsc looks similar to rpa , the irreducible vertices for the spin and charge channels are different , and are different from the bare interaction@xcite . in the case of the honeycomb lattice , for our purposes",

    "<S> strain tuning is increasingly being recognized as a clean tuning parameter to induce novel behavior in quantum matter . motivated by the possibility of straining graphene up to @xmath0 percent , we investigate novel quantum criticality due to interplay between strain - induced anisotropic band structure and critical antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afsf ) in this setting . </S>",
    "<S> we detail how this interplay drives @xmath1 a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between the dirac - semimetal - incoherent pseudogapped metal - correlated insulator as a function of strain ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath3 critical afsf - driven divergent nematic susceptibility near critical strain ( @xmath4 ) manifesting as critical singularities in magneto - thermal expansion and grneisen co - efficients . the correlated band insulator at large strain affords realization of a two - dimensional dimerized spin - singlet state due to this interplay , and we argue how doping such an insulator can lead to a spin - charge separated metal , leading to anomalous metallicity and possible unconventional superconductivity . on a wider front , our work serves to illustrate the range of novel states realizable by strain - tuning quantum materials .    the exciting discovery of single - layer graphene has spawned a tremendous burst of activity  @xcite on fundamental and applied grounds . </S>",
    "<S> it is the strongest electronic material , capable of sustaining reversible elastic deformations in excess of @xmath0 percent .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , graphene possesses rich electronic properties , originating from gapless , linearly dispersing dirac - like excitations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> attractive features like high mobility , absence of backscattering and strong field effects hold out the promise for future devices , but such possibilities are hindered by the gapless spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> inducement of a gap by quantum confinement is possible , but this also gives rise to edge roughness , with deleterious effect on electronic properties .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , strain engineering has been studied  @xcite as a way to profitably unite seemingly independent mechanical and electronic properties of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies indicate that reversible and controlled strain up to @xmath0 percent can be produced in graphene  @xcite , opening a unique opportunity to realize this aspect . </S>",
    "<S> while detailed investigation of this interplay within one - electron band structure has been carried out  @xcite , possibility of novel physics arising due to interplay between strain - modified electronic structure and electron - electron interactions has not received much attention . </S>",
    "<S> observed breakdown of the wiedemann - franz law  @xcite near the charge neutrality point betrays the effect of sizable @xmath5 interactions in graphene . in this light , one may anticipate that a strain - modified band structure could give rise to novel quantum phase transition(s ) and novel physical responses as a result of interplay between an anisotropic electronic structure and local coulomb interactions . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the possibility of inducing novel quantum phase transitions in ( @xmath0 percent ) strained graphene as a consequence of interplay between strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afsf ) and anisotropic band structure under strain . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our analysis has potentially wider consequences for materials with honeycomb lattice structures , but with correlations not so strong as to induce a mott transition ( which requires complementary dmft - like analyses  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the electronic structure of graphene under strain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have repeated their earlier analysis . as shown in detail in supplementary information ( si ) @xcite and in fig .  [ fig1 ] , </S>",
    "<S> zig - zag strain induces sizable reconstruction of the electronic structure : it moves the dirac point away from @xmath6 toward @xmath7 for finite strain , and @xmath3 beyond a critical zig - zag strain ( @xmath8 ) , a band - insulating gap develops in graphene and the `` dirac point '' gets shifted to the @xmath7 point . in contrast , armchair strain has very little effect on the electronic structure , so we will restrict ourselves to zig - zag strain hereafter .    </S>",
    "<S> though scarcely studied  @xcite , @xmath5 interactions are not negligible in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> realistic estimates put the intra - orbital hubbard @xmath9  ev within first - principles studies . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy is to vary @xmath10 from small to realistic values , where @xmath11 is the tight - binding hopping integral between nearest - neighbor @xmath12 orbitals on the honeycomb lattice . under zig - zag strain , </S>",
    "<S> the zig - zag hoppings @xmath13 progressively reduce , while the @xmath14 hopping @xmath15 increases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , interplay with hubbard correlations is , very generally , expected to @xmath1 enhance strain - induced anisotropy , @xmath3 produce a tendency to mott localization beyond a critical @xmath16 , and @xmath17 perhaps most importantly , to induce exotic semi - metallic / insulating states around critical strain @xmath18 when @xmath19 is varied across a critical @xmath20 . in the @xmath21 case that applies in graphene , long - range afsf should be very relevant . </S>",
    "<S> while dynamic - mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite or its cluster extensions can reveal `` mottness '' effects , they can not , by construction , access the effects of long - ranged critical afsf and possible af quantum criticality at low @xmath22 .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the role of long - range critical afsf in strained graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the two - particle self - consistent ( tpsc ) theory : tpsc exploits the pauli principle and exact sum rules  @xcite relating wave - vector dependent susceptibilities to _ local _ correlators to formulate a non - trivially renormalized version of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is similar in spirit to the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory of moriya and co - workers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> use of the renormalized hubbard u ( different for charge and spin channels ) , @xmath23 leads to a negative feedback in rpa , preventing the divergence of the spin susceptibility at _ any _ finite @xmath22 , in accord with stringent mermin - wagner restrictions in @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> further , tpsc also recovers quantum critical ( qc)-``renormalized classical ( rc ) '' and qc - quantum disordered ( qd ) crossovers at low but finite @xmath22 , and yields low-@xmath22 af correlation lengths in good accord with non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) predictions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus an excellent approximation for @xmath21 when coupling of carriers to long - range magnetic fluctuations is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , tpsc has been extensively employed  @xcite within the itinerant spin - fluctuation theory to study af quantum criticality in magnetic metals within the framework of hubbard models .    </S>",
    "<S> we now present our results for strained graphene , relegating technical details to si@xcite . for each value of strain ( @xmath2 ) , we vary the hubbard @xmath19 in the interval @xmath24  ev choosing an unstrained value of @xmath25  ev . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we show the imaginary part of the self - energy , im@xmath26 @xcite at the strain shifted `` dirac '' point as a function of matsubara frequency @xmath27 . for zero or small ( @xmath28 ) strain , </S>",
    "<S> the dirac lfl metal remains stable for the range of @xmath10 we consider , as seen by the fact that -im@xmath29 for small @xmath19 @xcite . for @xmath30 , however , we find im@xmath31 , implying correlated landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) , or dirac liquid metallicity , for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , for larger @xmath2-dependent @xmath33 , im@xmath26 shows anomalous behavior : -im@xmath26 _ increases _ as @xmath34 , reflecting appearance of a _ pseudogap _ in the one - particle excitation spectrum . in the inset , </S>",
    "<S> we show how @xmath35 develops an anomaly around @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> further , since gapless electronic states exist only at the `` dirac '' point , im@xmath37 also reflects the @xmath22-dependence of the @xmath38 resistivity : thus , given @xmath39 in the lfl regime , we expect the @xmath40-co - efficent of the resistivity to show a similar anomaly , reflecting a change from lfl metal to an incoherent non - lfl metal as @xmath41 around the critical strain .    within tpsc </S>",
    "<S> , the origin of this feature is associated with the coupling of itinerant @xmath12-band carriers to long - ranged , critical af spin fluctuations ( afsf ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we show that while the af correlation length ( @xmath42 ) is finite for @xmath43 , it indeed diverges ( for low @xmath22 , @xmath44 ) at @xmath45 for @xmath46 , confirming this view . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that @xmath47 e@xmath48 in the quantum critical region within tpsc ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) , in accord with predictions of the nlsm approach . </S>",
    "<S> these features are thus manifestations of the crossover from qd to the qc regime of afsf as @xmath19 increases : it is the coupling of itinerant @xmath12 carriers ( encoded in the bare one - electron propagator , @xmath49 ) to nearly critical afsf , encoded in the spin susceptibility @xmath50^{-1}$ ] with @xmath51 as above that drives the qd - qc crossover .    as expected , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we show that increasing strain ( toward @xmath4 ) reduces @xmath20 for the qd - qc crossover . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that reduction in @xmath52 along the zig - zag direction under strain enhances the effective @xmath10 anisotropically ( it becomes larger for the zig - zag relative to @xmath14 bonds ) , resulting in enhanced afsf for smaller @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this also implies that the renormalized afsf under strain will be enhanced by nearly - divergent @xmath54 , and that the feedback effect of the anisotropic afsf will in turn enhance the electronic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> while this issue requires a self - consistent extension of tpsc in its current form , we consider this issue ( see below ) while investigating strain - enhanced nematicity .    </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic electronic structure modification under strain has profound consequences . </S>",
    "<S> since uniaxial strain acts as a field conjugate to the nematic order parameter , electronic nematic ( en ) criticality itself will be washed out by strain , ruling out en itself as a candidate for the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) under strain . however , since strong afsf directly feed back on the tpsc self - energy  @xcite and hence the renormalized propagator , the non - trivial renormalization effects do show up in @xmath55^{-1}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> computing the average ( renormalized ) kinetic energies along @xmath56 bonds from @xmath57 thus allows for a direct estimate of the influence of strong afsf in enhancing strain - induced electronic anisotropy , and hence on _ bond _ en state . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we show variation of @xmath58 , with @xmath59 with @xmath60 without and with the hubbard @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it is rather clear that en `` order '' is significantly enhanced by strong afsf , the origin of which is anisotropic suppression of @xmath61 relative to @xmath62 , the latter itself being a direct consequence of afsf - driven anisotropic renormalization of @xmath63 under strain . </S>",
    "<S> finally , notwithstanding the absence of quantum criticality associated with en order , we find that @xmath64 shows an abrupt change precisely around @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there _ is _ evidence for nematic criticality as a function of strain : to characterize it , we observe that @xmath1 if bond en order would exist without strain , it would break the discrete ( @xmath66 for graphene ) rotational symmetry of the crystal lattice , implying spontaneous breaking of an ising - like symmetry , but @xmath3 strain washes out this criticality . </S>",
    "<S> however , since strain is a field conjugate to @xmath67 , nematic critiality can still occur  @xcite at finite strain , as in fe arsenides . </S>",
    "<S> such a criticality should show up as a divergent nematic susceptibility , @xmath68 , near @xmath20 . in the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we show that this is indeed what we find . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to the central conclusion of this work : _ a nematic quantum criticality of the quantum liquid - gas variety , driven by strong afsf around the critical @xmath20 , underlies the `` transition '' from dirac - lfl to an incoherent metal near critical strain_.    lack of lfl quasiparticles for @xmath33 as above implies that one should expect an ( anisotropic ) breakdown of the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law . </S>",
    "<S> this has recently been shown to occur for neutral graphene , leading to possibility of a novel `` dirac liquid ''  @xcite with transport due to collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> thermal and electrical transport under strain could help in determining the fate of the wf law under strain . </S>",
    "<S> however , use of strain as a tuning parameter suggests that studying magnetic - fluctuation contributions to magneto - volume , thermal expansion and grneisen co - efficents could more naturally facilitate observation of the above qpt . that it is possible to reversibly tune the strain to about @xmath0 percent </S>",
    "<S> could make the above scenario realistically possible . </S>",
    "<S> motivated hereby , we now propose that critical divergences in thermal expansion and magnetic grneisen co - efficients due to divergent afsf near @xmath4 can be fruitfully employed to unearth the novel criticality proposed here .    in our picture , coupling of strain to afsf results in a magneto - elastic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this will have novel consequences for spin fluctuation contribution to the magneto - volume , defined as @xmath69 and thermal expansion co - efficient , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> such effects have long been well - documented in @xmath71-band transition metals and compounds and explicated by the well - known moriya - usami approach  @xcite within scr theory . given that tpsc is an advanced variant of scr theory , we can use the scr formulation to investigate magneto - elastic effects in strained graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> moriya - usami theory asserts that electronic correlation or spin fluctuation contribution to the magneto - volume in the quantum paramagnetic state ( @xmath72 in @xmath21 ) is related , apart from parameters @xmath73 ( related to the strain dependence of the band - width via @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 , the bulk modulus , to the magnetic fluctuations , @xmath76 , the latter evaluated in the quantum paramagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> this can be evaluated using @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , the double occupancy evaluated from tpsc ( from @xmath79 ) using the tpsc sum rule , providing a direct way to study magnetoelastic effects near the qcp above . in fig.[fig5 ] , we show @xmath80 and @xmath81 for a range of @xmath19 near critical strain to illustrate the main features of interest . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 is negative and of the order of 1 , while @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , though the magnetic fluctuation contribution to @xmath83 is sizable at small strain , we find that _ both _ contributions vanish as @xmath84 . beyond a strain - dependent @xmath65 , </S>",
    "<S> however , marked changes show up : most interestingly , the influence of long - range critical afsf reveal themselves in a critical divergence in @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> further , this should have direct bearing on the divergence of the _ magnetic _ grneisen co - efficient , defined as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the electronic contribution to the specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> it is numerically involved to compute @xmath88 within tpsc : however , we expect @xmath89 in @xmath21 up to logarithmic corrections ( in fact , within the field - theoretic rg work of sheehy _ et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one finds @xmath90log@xmath91 with @xmath92 a constant . </S>",
    "<S> if this were to qualitatively hold right up to @xmath93 from the lfl side , it would imply that @xmath94 would also show a critical divergence . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these hallmarks of quantum criticality disappear beyond critical strain @xcite , pinning them to the influence of critical afsf .    </S>",
    "<S> anomalies in @xmath83 and @xmath95 have recently received intense attention in the context of quantum criticality in @xmath71- and @xmath96-band materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can now rationalize the critical divergence of @xmath97 near critical strain at @xmath19 close to @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> these are directly related to singular @xmath22-dependence of @xmath98 due to diverging afsf at sizable @xmath19 in the vicinity of @xmath4 as shown above . in light of inducement of reversible strain  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite up to @xmath0 percent , such a novel qcp with diverging nematic susceptibility at finite strain is potentially realizable in practice . more generally , _ </S>",
    "<S> metallic _ honeycomb materials involving @xmath99 in @xmath100 configuration  @xcite ( whence modelled by one - band hubbard model ) could exhibit such anomalies as we find near a pressure - driven mott transition between a spin - liquid insulator and ( incoherent ) metal .     </S>",
    "<S> +    we conclude by discussing the novel prospect of fractionalization of added electrons ( holes ) in heavily strained graphene . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath63 is enhanced by afsf under strain , it is reasonable to expect that at sizable @xmath101 @xmath102 , in the correlated `` band '' insulator beyond @xmath4 , the combined effect will be to readily promote spin - singlet valence - bond pairing on @xmath103-bonds . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] , it then follows that this state can be viewed as a @xmath21 generalization of ( dimerized ) polyacetylene . in our case , it is the interplay between strain and strong afsf ( which also promotes the nematic state ) which produces the dimerized state in the insulator . in the spinful case of relevance here , a single doped hole corresponds to a missing state in the valence band , and unoccupied , singly and doubly occupied states correspond  @xcite to charge and spin quantum numbers @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in panel ( b ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] , we schematically show how a doped hole results in generation of an extended `` string defect '' of singlets emanating from the bond hosting the hole : clearly the unpaired spin , originally in the vicinity of the hole , separates from it by creating such a string . thus , a doped hole will fractionalize into a spinless _ holon _ and a spin-@xmath107 spinon ! in the continuum limit , this could be seen by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes like equation for a doped hole , which results in only _ </S>",
    "<S> one _ renormalizable solution for a vortex or antivortex . </S>",
    "<S> this bares an alternative route to create fractionalized excitations by strain tuning in honeycomb lattice models . </S>",
    "<S> these solitonic excitations are defects in the dimerized ground state , and have exciting consequences . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , beginning with such an insulator , doping should lead to a fractionalized state , wherein electrical current is carried by holons but the hall current by spinons , as is implicit in the two - relaxation rate scenario  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , if two doped holes sit on different dimers , the hole pair , dressed by the dynamically fluctuating short - range singlet correlations ( see the dashed region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] , panel ( c ) ) could hop as a composite pair without scrambling the background spin configuration , leading to unconventional superconductivity in a spin - gapped background ( this would be a @xmath21 version of the luther - emery scenario in @xmath108 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our study points toward such exotic possibilities , but we leave more detailed exploration of these themes for the future .    to conclude , we have presented a specific scenario to realize a range of unconventional states of matter by use of `` clean '' strain - tuning in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> our work motivates study of other interesting materials like phosphorene , silicene , among other honeycomb systems , whose unstrained structures bear some resemblance to graphene . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be an attractive tool to investigate novel strain - induced qpts in topological and weyl systems , where the role of sizable coulomb interactions remains largely unexplored , and should be a theme of potential interest .    </S>",
