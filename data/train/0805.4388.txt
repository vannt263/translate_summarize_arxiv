    "in a recent paper  @xcite we have used the coupled cluster method ( ccm )  @xcite to study the influence of spin anisotropy on the ground - state ( gs ) magnetic ordering of an anisotropic version ( viz . , the @xmath0@xmath1 model ) of the well - known @xmath22@xmath23 model on the infinite two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , described below , for particles with spin quantum number @xmath24 .",
    "in the present paper we further the investigation of the @xmath0@xmath1 model by replacing the spin-@xmath6 particles by particles with @xmath25 .",
    "the main purpose of the previous paper was to examine carefully the role of spin anisotropy in tuning the quantum fluctuations that play such a key role in determining the quantum phase diagram of the pure ( spin - isotropic ) @xmath22@xmath23 model that has become an archetypal model for discussing the subtle interplay between the effects due to quantum fluctuations and frustration , as discussed below .",
    "while increasing the spin quantum number @xmath26 is , of course , expected to reduce the effects of quantum fluctuations , new and unexpected phenomena may also arise .",
    "thus , a well - known example of such new behaviour emerging when @xmath26 is increased is the appearance of the gapped haldane phase  @xcite in @xmath25 one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains , which is not present in their @xmath24 counterparts .",
    "the basic ( spin - isotropic ) @xmath22@xmath23 model with nearest - neighbour ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , of strengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , has been extensively studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "many of the earlier studies were motivated , at least in part , by the hope of shedding light on the possible link between antiferromagnetism and the onset of superconductivity at high temperature in the doped cuprate materials whose undoped precursors are seemingly well described by the @xmath24 version of the @xmath22@xmath23 model on the square lattice in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of several other quasi-2d materials that are realizations of the @xmath22@xmath23 model , has only served to extend the theoretical interest in the model .",
    "some of the actual magnetic compounds that can be well described by the @xmath29 @xmath22@xmath23 model are la@xmath30cuo@xmath31  @xcite for small values of @xmath32 , and li@xmath30vosio@xmath31 and li@xmath30vogeo@xmath31  @xcite for large values of @xmath32 .",
    "other such materials include the compounds vomoo@xmath31  @xcite and pb@xmath30vo(po@xmath31)@xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the compound vomoo@xmath31 is interesting because its exchange couplings appear to be more than an order of magnitude larger than those of li@xmath30vosio@xmath31 , even though the structures of the two compounds are closely related .",
    "similarly , the compound pb@xmath30vo(po@xmath31)@xmath30 also has a structure closely related to that of li@xmath30vosio@xmath31 , but it appears to have a ferromagnetic nn exchange coupling ( @xmath33 ) frustrated by an antiferromagnetic nnn exchange coupling ( @xmath34 ) , with @xmath35 .",
    "by contrast , although all of the other compounds mentioned above are also examples of quasi-2d frustrated spin-@xmath6 magnets , they have nn and nnn exchanges that are both antiferromagnetic .    for the past few decades , a great deal of attention",
    "has also been devoted to magnetic materials with spin-1 ions , such as the linear chain systems including csnicl@xmath36  @xcite with a weak axial anisotropy , csfebr@xmath36  @xcite with a strong planar anisotropy and the complex materials nenp ( ni(c@xmath30h@xmath37n@xmath30)@xmath30no@xmath30(clo@xmath31 ) )  @xcite with a weak planar anisotropy and nenc ( ni(c@xmath30h@xmath37n@xmath30)@xmath30ni(cn@xmath31 ) )  @xcite with a strong planar anisotropy ; as well as the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet k@xmath30nif@xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the spin gaps observed in csnicl@xmath36 and nenp are believed to be examples of the integer - spin gap behaviour predicted by haldane  @xcite ; whereas half - odd - integer spin sytems are gapless .",
    "another new spin - gapped material is the 2d triangular lattice antiferromagnet niga@xmath30s@xmath31  @xcite which , it has been argued  @xcite , may be a `` spin nematic ''  @xcite .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that the theoretical study of 2d spin-1 quantum magnets is worthy of pursuit .    in this context",
    "we note the recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature at @xmath38k in the layered iron - based compound laofeas , when doped by partial substitution of the oxygen atoms by fluorine atoms  @xcite , la[o@xmath39f@xmath40feas , with @xmath41 0.050.11 .",
    "this has been followed by the rapid discovery of superconductivity at even higher values of @xmath42 ( @xmath43k ) in a broad class of similar doped quaternary oxypnictide compounds .",
    "enormous interest has thereby been engendered in this class of materials .",
    "of particular relevance to the present work are the very recent first - principles calculations  @xcite showing that the undoped parent precursor material laofeas is well described by the spin-1 @xmath22@xmath23 model on the square lattice with @xmath44 , @xmath3 , and @xmath45 .",
    "broadly similar conclusions have also been reached by other authors  @xcite .",
    "many of the above quasi-2d magnetic materials , and many others like them , display interesting gs phases , often with subtle quantum phase transitions between them .",
    "generically , the interplay between reduced dimensionality , competing interactions and strong quantum fluctuations , seems to generate a number of new states of condensed matter with orderings that differ from the usual states of quasiclassical long - range order ( lro ) .",
    "thus , for high - temperature superconductivity , for example , anderson  @xcite has suggested that quantum spin fluctuations and frustration due to doping could lead to the collapse of the 2d nel - ordered antiferromagnetic phase present at zero doping , and that this could be a mechanism that drives the superconducting behaviour .",
    "this , and many similar experimental observations for other magnetic materials of reduced dimensionality , has intensified the study of order - disorder quantum phase transitions .",
    "thus , low - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets have attracted much recent attention as model systems in which strong quantum fluctuations might be able to destroy magnetic lro in the ground state ( gs ) . in the present paper we consider a system of @xmath46 spin-1 particles on a spatially isotropic 2d square lattice .",
    "the isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet with only nearest - neighbour ( nn ) bonds , all of equal strength ( @xmath47 ) , exhibits magnetic lro at zero temperature on such bipartite lattices as the square lattice considered here . a key mechanism that can then serve to destroy the lro for such systems ( with a given lattice and spins of a given spin quantum number @xmath26 ) is the introduction of competing or frustrating bonds on top of the nn bonds .",
    "the interested reader is referred to  @xcite for a more detailed discussion of 2d spin systems in general .    in this context , and as we have already noted above , an archetypal frustrated model of the above type that has attracted much theoretical attention in recent years is the 2d @xmath22@xmath23 model on a square lattice with both nn and nnn antiferromagnetic interactions , with strength @xmath47 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the nn bonds @xmath47 promote nel antiferromagnetic order , while the nnn bonds @xmath34 act to frustrate or compete with this order .",
    "all such frustrated quantum magnets continue to be of great theoretical interest because of the possible spin - liquid and other such novel magnetically disordered phases that they can exhibit ( and see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the @xmath48 @xmath22@xmath23 model on the 2d square lattice are well understood in the limits when @xmath49 or @xmath50 . for the case",
    "when @xmath49 , and the classical gs is perfectly nel - ordered , the quantum fluctuations are not sufficiently strong enough to destroy the nel lro , although the staggered magnetization is reduced to about 61% of its classical value .",
    "the opposite limit of large @xmath23 is a classic example  @xcite of the phenomenon of order by disorder  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case where @xmath51 with @xmath52 and fixed , the two sublattices each order antiferromagnetically at the classical level , but in directions which are independent of each other .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by quantum fluctuations and the gs becomes magnetically ordered collinearly as a stripe phase consisting of successive alternating rows ( or columns ) of parallel spins .",
    "it is by now also widely accepted that the @xmath48 @xmath22@xmath23 model exhibits the above two quasiclassical antiferromagnetic phases with lro at small and at large @xmath23 separated by an intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase without magnetic lro in the parameter region @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the gs at low @xmath56 exhibits nel - ordered magnetic lro ( with a wave vector @xmath57 ) , whereas the gs at large @xmath58 exhibits collinear stripe - ordered magnetic lro ( with a wave vector @xmath59 ) or @xmath60 ) .",
    "given the key role played by quantum fluctuations in determining the gs structure of frustrated magnets , it is clearly of central interest to focus special attention on the various means by which we may vary or `` tune '' them .",
    "clearly , as we have already noted , an increase in the spin quantum number @xmath26 is expected to decrease their strength .",
    "thus , for example , for the simple case of the isotropic heisenberg model on the square lattice with nn bonds all of the same strength , whereas the quantum fluctuations reduce the perfect nel ordering in the classical case ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) so that the staggered magnetization is only about 61% of its classical value for the @xmath24 case as noted above , the corresponding reduction in the @xmath25 case is less , namely to about 80% of the classical value ( and see  @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to investigate similarly the effect of increasing @xmath26 for the archetypal @xmath22@xmath23 model on the 2d square lattice . in order to do so",
    "it is convenient to consider at the same time any other means to `` tune '' the quantum fluctuations . in particular",
    ", we note that besides changing @xmath26 or the dimensionality and lattice type of the system , and apart from varying the relative strengths of the competing exchange interactions , another key mechanism to tune the quantum fluctuations is the introduction of anisotropy , either in real space  @xcite or in spin space  @xcite , into the existing exchange bonds .    turning first to the case of anisotropy in real ( crystal lattice ) space",
    ", we note that nersesyan and tsvelik  @xcite have recently introduced and studied an interesting generalization of the pure @xmath22@xmath23 model for the @xmath24 case in order to investigate the effects of spatial anisotropy on the quantum fluctuations in the model .",
    "this extended model , the so - called @xmath22@xmath62@xmath23 model , has been further studied by other groups for both the @xmath24  @xcite and the @xmath63  @xcite cases .",
    "this generalization of the 2d @xmath22@xmath23 model introduces a spatial anisotropy on the square lattice by allowing the nn bonds to have different strengths @xmath22 and @xmath62 in the two orthogonal spatial lattice dimensions , while keeping all of the nnn bonds across the diagonals to have the same strength @xmath23 . in previous work of our own  @xcite on this @xmath22@xmath62@xmath23 model",
    "we studied the effect of the coupling @xmath62 on the semiclassical nel - ordered and stripe - ordered phases . for the @xmath24 case",
    ", we found that the quantum critical points for both of these phases with lro increase as the coupling ratio @xmath64 is increased , and an intermediate phase with no magnetic lro only emerges when @xmath65 , with strong indications of a quantum triple point at @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath67 , the results agree with the previously known results of the @xmath22@xmath23 model described above .",
    "by contrast , for the @xmath63 case , we found no evidence for an intermediate phase between the nel and stripe states , as compared with all previous results for the corresponding @xmath24 case .",
    "however , for the @xmath25 case we found instead strong evidence for a quantum tricritical point at @xmath68 , where a line of second - order phase transitions between the quasiclassical nel - ordered and stripe - ordered phase ( for @xmath69 ) meets a line of first - order phase transitions between the same two states ( for @xmath70 ) .",
    "for @xmath71 the results obviously reproduce those of the usual spin-1 @xmath22@xmath23 model , for which @xmath72 .    finally , we turn to the main subject of interest in this paper , namely to further the study of the 2d spin-1 @xmath22@xmath23 model on the square lattice by introducing anisotropy in spin space . while the influence of the spin anisotropy on the @xmath24 @xmath22@xmath23 model on the square lattice has been studied by various groups  @xcite ,",
    "including ourselves  @xcite , relatively little is known for the @xmath63 case .",
    "our aim here is to further the study of the @xmath0@xmath1 model for the @xmath63 case , by making use of the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) carried out to high orders by making use of supercomputing resources .",
    "the ccm ( see  @xcite and references cited therein ) is one of the most powerful and most universally applicable of all known _ ab initio _ techniques of modern microscopic quantum many - body theory . it is also one of the most accurate methods available at attainable levels of computational implementation .",
    "we note , in the present context , that the ccm is a particularly effective tool for studying highly frustrated quantum magnets , where such other numerical methods as the quantum monte carlo method and the exact diagonalization method are often severely limited in practice , e.g. , by the `` minus - sign problem '' for the former case , and the very small sizes of the spin systems that can be handled in practice with available computing resources for the latter .",
    "this is especially true for spin systems with spin quantum number @xmath73 , as are of interest here .",
    "the ccm has been applied successfully on many previous occasions to calculate the ground - state and excited - state properties of a diverse array of quantum spin systems  @xcite .",
    "exactly as for the @xmath29 case that we studied earlier  @xcite , the @xmath63 @xmath22@xmath23 heisenberg model employed here has two kinds of exchange bonds , namely the nn @xmath22 bonds along both the row and the column directions of the square lattice , and the nnn @xmath23 bonds along the diagonals of the squares .",
    "the model is then generalized by including an anisotropy in spin space in both types of bonds . the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 is assumed to be the same in both exchange terms , thus producing the so - called @xmath0@xmath1 model , with a hamiltonian given by @xmath74 where the sums over @xmath75 and @xmath76 run over all nn and nnn pairs respectively , counting each bond once and once only .",
    "both exchange couplings are assumed to be antiferromagnetic here ( i.e. , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , and henceforth the energy scale is set by putting @xmath79 .",
    "we shall also only be concerned here with the case @xmath80 .",
    "the model has two types of classical ground state ( gs ) , namely a @xmath8-aligned state for @xmath9 and an @xmath10-planar - aligned state for @xmath81 .",
    "since all directions in the @xmath10-plane in spin space are equivalent , we may choose the direction arbitrarily for the @xmath10-planar - aligned state to be the @xmath82-direction , say .",
    "both of these @xmath8-aligned and @xmath82-aligned ground states further divide into a nel ( @xmath83 ) state and collinear stripe states ( columnar stripe ( @xmath84 ) and row stripe ( @xmath85 ) ) .",
    "there is clearly a symmetry under the interchange of rows and columns , and hence we only consider the columnar stripe state .",
    "the nel states are the classical gs for @xmath86 , and the collinear stripe states are the classical gs for @xmath87 .",
    "the ( first - order ) classical phase transition between these states of perfect classical lro occurs precisely at @xmath88 , .",
    "we now briefly describe the ccm formalism . for further details interested readers",
    "are referred , for example , to  @xcite and references cited therein .    in order to use the ccm",
    "the first step is always the choice of a normalized model ( or reference ) state @xmath89 which is required to act as a cyclic vector ( or , more physically , as a generalized vacuum state ) with respect to a complete set of mutually commuting multi - configurational creation operators , @xmath90 that need to be chosen simultaneously .",
    "the index @xmath91 here is a set - index that gives a complete labelling of the many - particle configuration created in the state @xmath92 .",
    "the requirements on @xmath93 are that any many - particle state can be exactly decomposed as a unique linear combination of the states @xmath94 , together with the conditions , @xmath95 @xmath96 = 0 = [ c^{-}_{i},c^{-}_{j}]\\ , .",
    "\\label{c_comm}\\ ] ]    the exact many - body gs ket and bra states , whose solutions we seek via the ccm calculation at hand , satisfy the respective schrdinger equations , @xmath97 respectively , with the normalization defined by @xmath98 [ i.e. , with @xmath99 , and with @xmath100 itself satisfying the intermediate normalization condition @xmath101 . in terms of the set @xmath93",
    ", the ccm now employs an exponential parametrization for the exact gs ket energy eigenstate , @xmath102 the gs ccm correlation operators , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , contain the real c - number correlation coefficients , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , that need to be calculated . clearly ,",
    "once they are known , all other gs properties of the many - body system can be derived from them . in order to find them we simply insert the parametrizations ( [ ccm_para_ket ] ) and ( [ ccm_para_bra ] ) into the schrdinger equations ( [ sch_eq_ket ] ) and ( [ sch_eq_bra ] ) , and then project onto the complete sets of states @xmath107 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "completely equivalently , we may simply demand that the gs energy expectation value , @xmath108 , is minimized with respect to the entire set @xmath109 . in either case",
    "we are easily led to the equations @xmath110\\mbox{e}^{s}|\\phi\\rangle & = 0\\ ; ; \\quad \\forall i \\neq 0 \\ , ,   \\label{bra_coeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are first derived using computer algebra and then solved for the set @xmath109 within specific truncation schemes described below , by making use of parallel computing routines  @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ ket_coeff ] ) also shows that the gs energy at the stationary point has the simple form @xmath111 it is important to realize that this bi - variational formulation does not necessarily lead to an upper bound for @xmath112 when the summations for @xmath103 and @xmath104 in ( [ ccm_para_ket],b ) are truncated , due to the lack of manifest hermiticity when such approximations are made .",
    "nonetheless , one can prove  @xcite that the important hellmann - feynman theorem _ is _ preserved in all such approximations .",
    "equation ( [ ket_coeff ] ) represents a coupled set of nonlinear multinomial equations for the c - number correlation coefficients @xmath113 .",
    "the nested commutator expansion of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian , @xmath114 + \\frac{1}{2!}[[h , s],s ] + \\cdots \\ , ,   \\label{h_sim_xform}\\ ] ] and the fact that all of the individual components of @xmath103 in the expansion of ( [ ccm_para_ket ] ) commute with one another by construction , as in ( [ c_comm ] ) , together imply that each element of @xmath103 in ( [ ccm_para_ket ] ) is linked directly to the hamiltonian in each of the terms in ( [ h_sim_xform ] ) .",
    "each of the coupled equations ( [ ket_coeff ] ) is hence of goldstone _ linked - cluster _ type , which thereby guarantees that all extensive variables , such as the energy , scale linearly with particle number , @xmath115 .",
    "thus , at any level of approximation obtained by truncation in the summations on the index @xmath91 in ( [ ccm_para_ket ] ) and ( [ ccm_para_bra ] ) , we may always work safely from the outset in the limit @xmath46 of an infinite system , as we do in all our calculations below .",
    "it is also important to note that each of the linked - cluster equations ( [ ket_coeff ] ) is actually of finite length when expanded , since the otherwise infinite series of ( [ h_sim_xform ] ) will always terminate at a finite order , provided only that each term in the hamiltonian , @xmath116 , contains a finite number of single - particle destruction operators defined with respect to the reference ( vacuum ) state @xmath89 , as in the case of our hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the implementation of the ccm for quantum spin systems , for which it is usually convenient to take the classical ground states as our ( initial ) choices for the model state @xmath89 .",
    "hence , we may choose here either a nel state or a collinear ( columnar ) stripe state for @xmath117 .",
    "each of these can be further sub - divided into a @xmath8-aligned choice or an @xmath10-planar ( say , @xmath82-aligned ) choice , which we expect to be appropriate for the regions @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively on purely classical grounds . we present results in section  [ results ] based on all four of these classical ground states as choices for @xmath89 . in order to implement the ccm computationally it is very convenient to treat the spins on every lattice site in any chosen model state @xmath89 as equivalent . in order to do",
    "so we introduce a different local quantization axis and a correspondingly different set of spin coordinates on each site , so that all spins , whatever their original orientations in @xmath89 in the global spin - coordinate system , align along the negative @xmath8-direction , say , in these local spin coordinates .",
    "this can always be done by defining a suitable rotation in spin space of the global spin coordinates at each lattice site .",
    "such rotations are canonical transformations that leave the spin commutation relations unchanged . in these local spin axes where the configuration indices @xmath91 simply become a set of lattice site indices , @xmath120 , the generalized multi - configurational creation operators @xmath121 are simple products of single spin - raising operators , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are the usual su(2 ) spin operators on lattice site @xmath125 . for the quasiclassical magnetically - ordered states that we calculate here ,",
    "the order parameter is the sublattice magnetization , @xmath126 , which is given within our local spin coordinates defined above as @xmath127    the ccm formalism is clearly exact if one includes all spin configurations @xmath91 in the expansions ( [ ccm_para_ket ] ) and ( [ ccm_para_bra ] ) of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 operators respectively .",
    "however , truncations are necessary in practice . based on a great deal of previous experience",
    ", we usually employ the so - called lsub@xmath128 approximation scheme for @xmath48 quantum spin systems ( see  @xcite and references cited therein ) , and its so - called sub@xmath128@xmath129 counterpart for @xmath63 systems ( see  @xcite and references cited therein ) . the lsub@xmath128 scheme is defined such that all possible multi - spin - flip correlations over different locales on the lattice defined by @xmath128 or fewer contiguous lattice sites are retained at the @xmath128th level of approximation . for the case of spins with @xmath130 , the multi - configurational creation operators , @xmath121 can contain no more than one spin - raising operator @xmath131 for each lattice site @xmath132 .",
    "however , the number of fundamental lsub@xmath128 configurations for @xmath25 becomes appreciably higher than for @xmath24 , since each spin on each site @xmath132 can now be flipped twice by the spin - raising operators , so that in this case the multi - configurational creation operators , @xmath121 can contain up to two spin - raising operator @xmath131 for each lattice site @xmath132 .",
    "thus , for systems with @xmath73 it is more practical to use the sub@xmath128@xmath129 scheme , in which all correlations involving no more than @xmath128 spin flips spanning a range of no more than @xmath129 adjacent lattice sites are retained .",
    "clearly , for spins with @xmath63 , the sub@xmath133@xmath128 scheme is fully equivalent to the lsub@xmath128 scheme .",
    "more generally for spins with arbitrary spin quantum number @xmath26 , sub@xmath134@xmath128 @xmath135 lsub@xmath128 . in order to keep the number of fundamental configurations from growing too quickly with increasing level of approximation we set @xmath136 , and thus we have the sub@xmath128@xmath128 scheme .",
    "the approximation clearly becomes exact as @xmath137 .",
    "we note that , in general terms , both the lsub@xmath128 and sub@xmath128@xmath129 truncation schemes are systematic _ localized _ approximation hierarchies in which the truncation indices are physically related to the size of the clusters of spins on the lattice for which the multi - spin correlations are explicitly included .",
    "their physical motivation ( and eventual justification ) thus stems ultimately from the localized short - range nature of the underlying hamiltonian ( which , in the present case , involves just two - spin interactions at nn and nnn distances apart only ) .",
    "the maximum number of spins correlated in such clusters is @xmath128 in both cases .",
    "by contrast , the sub@xmath128 scheme ( which is formally equivalent to the sub@xmath128@xmath129 scheme in the limit @xmath138 ) explicitly correlates all clusters of spins involving no more than @xmath128 spin - flips , regardless of the spatial separations of the spins within the correlated clusters .",
    "it is important to note however that in _ all _ ccm approximations ( including the lsub@xmath128 and sub@xmath128@xmath129 schemes ) each correlated cluster configuration retained within the correlation operator @xmath103 of ( [ ccm_para_ket ] ) is actually counted an _ arbitrarily large _ number of times due to the exponentiated form in which the operator @xmath103 appears in the parametrization ( [ ccm_para_ket ] ) .",
    "it is precisely the exponential form that guarantees the proper counting of arbitrary multiples , at different positions on the lattice , of each configuration ( and all products of such multiples for different configurations ) retained in @xmath103 , considered as _",
    "independent _ excitations .",
    "thus , even though , for example , the lsub@xmath128 and sub@xmath128@xmath129 truncation schemes are motivated by the inclusion of the explicit correlations within localized clusters of spins only up to a given size , every approximation includes configurations in which an _ arbitrary _ number of spins ( up to all @xmath46 spins ) are correlated , albeit as ( properly counted ) products of independent sub - clusters up to a given finite size .",

    "we see that the number of fundamental configurations for the planar model state at the sub@xmath142@xmath142 level of approximation is 61904 for the nel phase and 123471 for the stripe phase .",
    "the intensive calculations required at even this very high order of approximation are easily practicable with relatively modest supercomputing resources .",
    "thus , for example , we employed 200 processors simultaneously to execute the sub@xmath142@xmath142 calculations using the planar @xmath82-aligned collinear stripe state as model state , and with this number of processors it took about six hours to solve the ccm equations ( [ ket_coeff ] ) and ( [ bra_coeff ] ) at this level of approximation for each value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .    clearly , the last step in our calculations is to extrapolate the approximate sub@xmath128@xmath128 results to the exact , @xmath137 , limit .",
    "we use here for the extrapolations of the raw sub@xmath128@xmath128 data the same well - tested scaling laws as we used previously in our studies of the @xmath22@xmath62@xmath23 model for both the @xmath24 case  @xcite and the @xmath25 case  @xcite , as well as for the @xmath24 version of the present model  @xcite .",
    "thus , the scaling law used for the gs energy per spin , @xmath143 , is @xmath144 and that for the staggered magnetization , @xmath126 , is @xmath145    in order to have a robust and stable fit to any fitting formula that contains @xmath129 unknown parameters , it is well known that it is desirable to have at least ( @xmath146 ) data points ( the so - called @xmath146 rule ) . both of our scaling laws ( [ e_scaling ] ) and ( [ m_scaling ] ) contain @xmath147 unknown parameters to be determined , and in all cases we have sub@xmath128@xmath128 data sets with @xmath148 . in all our results presented below the sub@xmath128@xmath128 results",
    "are extrapolated to the limit @xmath137 using the sets with @xmath148 for both the @xmath8-aligned and planar @xmath82-aligned states .",
    "however , we have also extrapolated @xmath143 and @xmath126 using the sets @xmath149 and @xmath150 . in all cases they lead to very similar results , thereby adding credence to their validity and stability .",
    "we also note that for the corresponding @xmath48 model we could perform lsub@xmath151 sub@xmath128@xmath128 approximation calculations for @xmath152 .",
    "this enabled us to perform extrapolations using the sets @xmath148 and @xmath152 as well as the preferred set @xmath153 .",
    "gratifyingly , all sets yielded very similar extrapolated results , even near phase boundaries and the quantum triple point , which gives us great confidence in the accuracy and robustness of our extrapolation scheme .",
    "figure  [ e_spin1 ]    shows the extrapolated ccm results for the gs energy per spin , @xmath143 , as a function of @xmath23 for various values of @xmath5 , using both the @xmath8-aligned and planar @xmath82-aligned model states . for each value of @xmath5 two curves",
    "are shown , one ( for smaller values of @xmath23 ) using the nel state , and the other ( for larger values of @xmath23 ) using the stripe state as ccm model state . as has been discussed in detail elsewhere  @xcite , the coupled sets of lsub@xmath128 equations ( [ ket_coeff ] ) have natural termination points ( at least for values @xmath154 ) for some critical value of a control parameter ( here the anisotropy , @xmath5 ) , beyond which no real solutions to the equations exist .",
    "thus , for each set of calculations based on one of the four ccm model states used , the @xmath155 points shown in figure [ e_spin1 ] are either those natural termination points described above for the highest ( sub88 ) level of approximation we have implemented , or the points where the gs energy becomes a maximum should the latter occur first ( i.e. , as one approaches the termination point ) .",
    "the advantage of this usage of the @xmath155 points is that we do not then display gs energy data in any appreciable regimes where sub@xmath128@xmath128 calculations with very large values of @xmath128 ( higher than can feasibly be implemented ) would not have solutions , because of having terminated already .",
    "all of the curves such as those shown in figure  [ e_spin1 ] illustrate very clearly that the corresponding pairs of gs energy curves ( for the same values of @xmath5 ) for the nel and stripe phases cross one another , for both the @xmath8-aligned ( figure  [ e_zaligned_spin1 ] for all values @xmath9 ) and the @xmath82-aligned ( figure  [ e_planar_spin1 ] for all values @xmath11 ) cases .",
    "the crossings occur with a clear discontinuity in slope , which is completely characteristic of a first - order phase transition , exactly as observed in the classical ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) case . unlike in the @xmath24 version of this model that we studied earlier  @xcite ,",
    "there is no indication at all in the present @xmath63 case of any intermediate paramagnetic phase emerging for any values of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the direct first - order phase transition , so indicated by our results for the gs energy , between the quasiclassical nel - ordered and collinear stripe - ordered phases , in both the @xmath8-aligned and planar @xmath82-aligned cases , occurs for all values of @xmath80 very close to the classical phase boundary @xmath156 , the point of maximum ( classical ) frustration .",
    "we show in figure  [ m_spin1 ]    corresponding indicative sets of ccm results , based on the same four model states , for the gs order parameter ( viz . , the staggered magnetization ) , to those shown in figure [ e_spin1 ] for the gs energy .",
    "the staggered magnetization data completely reinforce the phase structure of the model as deduced above from the gs energy data .",
    "thus , let us now denote by @xmath157 the quantum phase transition point deduced from curves such as those shown in figure [ m_spin1 ] , where @xmath157 is generically defined to be either ( a ) the point where corresponding pairs of ccm staggered magnetization curves ( for the same value of @xmath5 ) , based on the nel and stripe model states , intersect one another if they do so at a physical value @xmath158 ; or ( b ) if they do not so intersect at a value @xmath158 , the two points where the corresponding values of the staggered magnetization go to zero .",
    "clearly , in this generic scenario , case ( a ) corresponds to a direct phase transition between the nel and stripe phases , which will generally be first - order if the intersection point has a value @xmath159 ( and , only exceptionally , second - order , if the crossing occurs exactly at @xmath160 ) .",
    "on the other hand , case ( b ) corresponds to the situation where the points where the lro vanishes for both quasiclassical ( i.e. , nel - ordered and stripe - ordered ) phases are indicative of a phase transition from each of these phases to some intermediate magnetically - disordered phase .",
    "a detailed discussion of this order parameter criterion for a phase transition and its relation to the stricter energy crossing criterion has been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figures  [ m_zaligned_spin1 ] and  [ m_planar_spin1 ] that case ( b ) above never occurs for the present spin-1 model for any values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 or for any values of the nnn exchange coupling @xmath28 , unlike in the @xmath24 version of this model that we studied earlier  @xcite .    by putting together data of the sort shown in figures [ e_spin1 ] and [ m_spin1 ] we can now deduce the gs phase diagram of our system from our ccm calculations based on the four model states with quasiclassical antiferromagnetic lro that we have employed .",
    "figure  [ phase_spin1 ]    shows the zero - temperature gs phase diagram of the 2d @xmath63 @xmath0@xmath1 model on the square lattice for the @xmath8-aligned and planar @xmath82-aligned states , as obtained from our extrapolated results for both the gs energy and the gs order parameter .",
    "the completely independent results from both the energy criterion and the order parameter criterion for the phase transition give extremely similar positions for the phase boundary , as one can observe from figure  [ phase_spin1 ] .",
    "note that the results from using the order parameter criterion become increasingly inaccurate for large values of @xmath5 , and this is why we show them in figure  [ phase_spin1 ] only out to @xmath161 .",
    "the reason for this is simple .",
    "thus , as @xmath20 , the order parameters @xmath162 for both the nel - ordered and collinear stripe - ordered phases , and it becomes increasingly difficult to determine the point where they cross , since the angle of their crossing becomes vanishingly small .",
    "this effect can clearly be seen in figure  [ m_zaligned_spin1 ] , where it has clearly become acute even for values of @xmath5 as small as about 2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy criterion correspondingly becomes _ more _ accurate as @xmath20 , as one may observe from figure  [ e_zaligned_spin1 ] .",
    "thus , figure  [ phase_spin1 ] clearly shows that the phase boundary approaches the classical line @xmath163 as @xmath20 , as expected in this ising - like limit .",
    "our results certainly provide very clear and consistent evidence that there exists no intermediate phase .",
    "thus , the curves for the order parameters of the nel and stripe phases always meet at a finite value and the corresponding curves for the gs energies of the two phases intersect with a discontinuity in slope , for both the @xmath8-aligned and planar @xmath82-aligned states , for all values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 .",
    "all of the evidence clearly points towards a first - order phase transition between the two phases .",
    "we note also that the @xmath8-aligned and @xmath10-planar - aligned phases meet precisely at the isotropic point @xmath15 , just as in the classical case , and exactly as expected .",
    "however , this does provide a consistency check on our independent numerical calculations for the two phases .",
    "the case @xmath15 obviously reproduces the usual ( isotropic ) @xmath22@xmath23 model .",
    "thus , at @xmath15 , we find @xmath164 which , very encouragingly , is the same value we found  @xcite for the @xmath63 @xmath22@xmath62@xmath23 model in the spatially isotropic limiting case when @xmath71 .",
    "we also note that in the present spin-1 quantum model , the isotropic point @xmath15 is precisely the point at which the boundary between the two quasiclassical phases deviates most from its classical position at @xmath165 for all values of @xmath80 .",
    "our calculations also indicate that at the isotropic @xmath17 point of the model ( i.e. , where @xmath18 ) the phase boundary is at @xmath166 .",
    "our results have clearly shown in detail how the quantum fluctuations present in the spin-1 @xmath27@xmath28 model on the infinite square lattice are diminished by varying the spin anisotropy parameter @xmath5 away from the heisenberg isotropic point @xmath15 in either direction .",
    "this is precisely as was observed previously  @xcite for the spin-@xmath6 version of the same model , and as was to be expected .",
    "however , unlike what would be predicted by lowest - order ( or linear ) spin - wave theory ( lswt )  @xcite , for example , we can now conclude with confidence from our results that no such intermediate disordered phase as the one that we observed in the spin-@xmath6 version of this model between the two quantum triple points at ( @xmath167 = @xmath168 , @xmath169 = @xmath170 ) and ( @xmath167 = @xmath171 , @xmath169 = @xmath172 ) , exists for the spin-1 version , for any values of the parameters @xmath7 and  @xmath5 .    in the context of a spin - wave theory ( swt ) treatment of the isotropic @xmath27@xmath28 model on the square lattice , lswt predicts that quantum fluctuations can destabilize the classical gs with lro , even at large values of the spin quantum number @xmath26 , for values of the frustration parameter @xmath32 around 0.5 .",
    "for the spin-@xmath6 case the range of values , @xmath173 , for which a magnetically - disordered phase thereby occurs is predicted by lswt to be given by @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "these values may be compared to our own predictions  @xcite of @xmath176 and @xmath177 . for the spin-1 case lswt",
    "predicts a narrower , but still non - vanishing , strip of disordered intermediate phase in a range with @xmath178 and @xmath179 , whereas we predict with confidence that the disordered phase simply does not exist as a gs in this case .    the discrepancy between our results and those of lswt for the spin-1 case are undoubtedly due to the shortcomings of lswt .",
    "thus , while lswt can work reasonably well in the absence of frustration ( e.g. , for the isotropic @xmath27@xmath28 model here when @xmath180 , that represents the heisenberg model with only nn interactions ) , in the presence of frustration it consistently overestimates the effects of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this effect worsens as the frustration ( here measured by the ratio @xmath32 ) increases .",
    "thus , igarashi  @xcite has shown explicitly for the @xmath27@xmath28 model by going to higher orders in swt ( i.e. , by calculating higher - order terms in the @xmath181 power expansion ) , that while the series seems to converge for values @xmath182 , the second - order corrections grow so large for values @xmath183 that no prediction based on lswt , or even on higher - order swt , in this region ( e.g. , about the appearance of an intermediate magnetically - disordered phase near @xmath184 ) should be relied upon .",
    "furthermore , he showed that the effects of the higher - order correction terms to lswt make the nel - ordered state more stable than predicted by lswt .",
    "relatively little attention has been paid by other authors to the ( pure , isotropic ) @xmath27@xmath28 model at higher values of the spin quantum number , @xmath73 .",
    "we note , however , that cai _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have also recently postulated the possible existence of an intermediate phase between the quasiclassical nel - ordered and collinear stripe - ordered phases for the spin-1 model .",
    "more specifically , they hypothesize an intermediate valence - bond solid ( vbs ) ground state ( gs ) for the spin-1 isotropic @xmath27@xmath28 model at or near the point of maximal classical frustration where @xmath185 . their evidence is indirect and",
    "is based on a trial variational state of vbs type , which is an _ exact _",
    "gs of a related spin-1 model hamiltonian , and on a pseudopotential approach to extend it to the actual spin-1 @xmath27@xmath28 model .",
    "they express the dual hopes that this trial state might capture the main character of the disordered phase that they thereby predict for the fully frustrated case , and that accurate numerical methods , such as those considered here , might verify the existence of this postulated intermediate phase .",
    "such variational analyses , based on physically motivated trial states , are always of interest , but have a very chequered history of success in the field of highly correlated spin- and electron - lattice systems . in the present case",
    "we stress again that our own detailed numerical analysis provides no evidence at all for the existence of such an intermediate magnetically - disordered vbs phase as postulated by cai _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in the same context ,",
    "we note too that in earlier work read and sachdev  @xcite have applied a large-@xmath115 expansion technique based on symplectic sp(@xmath115 ) symmetry to the isotropic @xmath27@xmath28 model .",
    "they found that the method , which can itself be regarded as akin to a @xmath181 expansion , predicts an intermediate phase ( with vbs order ) for smaller values of @xmath26 , but that this phase disappears for larger values of @xmath26 where they predict instead a first - order transition between the nel and stripe phases .",
    "all of these qualitative results for the pure @xmath27@xmath28 model are in accord with our quantitative predictions .",
    "we note that the results presented here for the spin - anisotropic spin-1 @xmath186@xmath187 model are also fully consistent with our own previous results  @xcite for the spatially - anisotropic spin-1 @xmath27@xmath62@xmath23 model discussed in section  [ intro ] above , for which we also found no evidence for an intermediate disordered phase between the quasiclassical nel and collinear stripe phases with lro .",
    "however , whereas for the spin-1 @xmath27@xmath62@xmath28 model we found strong evidence for a quantum tricritical point at ( @xmath188 , @xmath189 ) where a line of second - order phase transitions between the nel - ordered and the collinear stripe - ordered states ( for @xmath190 ) meets a line of first - ordered phase transitions between the same two states ( for @xmath191 ) , we find for the present spin-1 @xmath0@xmath1 model that the phase transition between these two states is first - order for all values @xmath80 . clearly , these two sets of results are in complete agreement with one another at their common point of overlap , when @xmath192 and @xmath15 .    at the @xmath17 isotropic point ( @xmath18 ) of the present spin-1 @xmath0@xmath1 model",
    "we predict that the phase boundary occurs at a value @xmath193 .",
    "it is interesting to note that our previous results for the spin-@xmath6 version of the model  @xcite showed a quantum triple point ( qtp ) at ( @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) .",
    "clearly our results for this spin-@xmath6 case are consistent with this lower qtp occurring exactly at the @xmath17 isotropic point ( @xmath18 ) and also at the point of maximum classical frustration , @xmath196 .",
    "similarly , in the present spin-1 case our results are consistent with the phase boundary at the @xmath17 isotropic point also occurring at the point @xmath196 .",
    "it would seem likely , therefore , that for both the cases of spin-@xmath6 and spin-1 particles the corresponding quantum @xmath197@xmath198 model has a special behaviour at the point @xmath199 where the classical frustration is greatest .",
    "our results indicate that a more detailed investigation of this case might , therefore , be worth undertaking for general values of the spin quantum number @xmath26 .",
    "although there is very little other accurate numerical work for the present model against which to make comparisons , there have been several previous detailed comparisons , for example , of ccm results with those from the exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite spin - lattices for some particular models .",
    "one such example  @xcite is the spin-@xmath6 @xmath200@xmath201 ( or zigzag ) model on the square lattice which contains two kinds of nn isotropic heisenberg interactions , of strength @xmath200 and @xmath201 respectively , such that each square plaquette contains three @xmath200-bonds and one @xmath201-bond , with the @xmath201-bonds arranged in a regular zigzag fashion such that every lattice site on the square lattice is joined to only one @xmath201-bond .",
    "an alternative but equivalent description of the model is that it interpolates between a honeycomb and a square lattice , such that the @xmath200-bonds join nn lattice sites on the honeycomb lattice , and the @xmath201-bonds join sites across only one of the main diagonals of each hexagon , such that when @xmath202 the model is equivalent to the nn isotropic heisenberg model on the square lattice .    ed calculations were performed for the above model  @xcite for lattices with up to @xmath203 sites . in general terms",
    "it was found that the ccm results for the model at attainable levels of implementation ( viz . , using the lsub@xmath128 approximation with @xmath204 agree well with the extrapolated ( @xmath46 ) ed data .",
    "the ccm is particularly good , however , at describing both the dimerized and the helical gs phases that this system can support . for the latter phase the ed results lie appreciably above those from the ccm",
    "this is because the energies for the small lattices able to be considered do not fit well to the known theoretical finite - size scaling law in this regime .",
    "it is no surprise that finite - size effects for systems with an incommensurate helical spin structure are larger than for systems with nel order or that are ordered with dimerized spin pairs .",
    "similar conclusions were also drawn for comparions of ccm and ed results for extensions of the above spin-@xmath6 @xmath200@xmath201 model to both ( a ) the anisotropic @xmath205@xmath206 model  @xcite where both bonds contain an ising anisotropy of precisely the sort considered in the present paper ; and ( b ) the case where the spin quantum number @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "for the latter case of the spin-1 @xmath200@xmath201 model , calculations were performed using both the ccm in the sub@xmath128@xmath128 scheme with @xmath207 and the ed technique on lattices of sizes @xmath208 .",
    "again , the resulting finite - size ed extrapolations remained quite poor , and only allowed some qualitative conclusions to be drawn , whereas results from the ccm were seen to be much more robust and more reliable . in no case , however , did the ccm and ed results conflict with each other .",
    "another model where ed and ccm results have been compared is the pure ( isotropic ) spin-@xmath6 @xmath27@xmath28 model on the square lattice  @xcite .",
    "again , the ed results ( with @xmath209 ) were found to provide a good qualitative check of the ccm data for lsub@xmath128 calculations performed with @xmath204 .",
    "finally , for the spin-@xmath6 version of the present anisotropic @xmath0@xmath1 model , we  @xcite have also compared the ccm results with those from ed calculations on finite - sized lattices of size @xmath210 sites ( with periodic boundary conditions imposed ) . in this case too the ed data are best used to complement the ccm results . on the basis of all the above evidence",
    "we expect that the same will hold true for the spin-1 version of the model studied here . since the number of basis states increases roughly as @xmath211 for the spin-1 case , by comparison with @xmath212 for the spin-@xmath6 case , ed calculations for the present model would be limited to lattices of sizes @xmath213 and @xmath214 . the next biggest lattice that preserves the full lattice symmetry has @xmath215 sites in this case , and an ed calculation of this size for the spin-1 model is probably beyond the limits of presently available computing power . with only such limited data the ed finite - size extraploation",
    "would again be bound to remain poor , as seen in the previous work cited above , and we fully expect that the ccm results would again prevail even if ed results were available for the present model .    finally , we note that our analysis and conclusions have relied heavily on two of the unique strengths of the ccm , namely its ability to deal with highly frustrated systems as easily as unfrustrated ones , and its use from the outset of infinite lattices .",
    "these , in turn , lead to its ability to yield accurate predictions for the locations of phase boundaries . our own results for the gs energy and staggered magnetization provide a set of independent checks that lead us to believe that we now have a self - consistent and coherent description of these challenging anisotropic and frustrated @xmath0@xmath1 systems for both the spin-@xmath6 and spin-1 cases .",
