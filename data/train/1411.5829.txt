    "many main - sequence stars host circumstellar dust discs whose particles re - emit the absorbed stellar light and produce thermal emission at infrared ( ir ) and millimeter wavelengths . grain - grain collisions and dynamical interactions with the stellar radiation lead to the removal of the emitting dust particles on a timescale significantly shorter than the age of the star .",
    "it is believed that the particles are continuously replenished by collisional erosion of previously formed larger bodies .",
    "thus , these _ debris _ discs are composed of second generation material , and their presence implies the existence of a significant planesimal population . because of the close link between the dust and large bodies the detailed investigation of the debris discs can also provide information on the characteristics and evolution of the parent planetesimal belt(s ) and even on the formation and evolution of the underlying planetary system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for collisions to produce a copious amount of dust , the relative velocities between the colliding larger bodies must exceed a critical value .",
    "this requires a dynamical stirring of the planetesimals motion . in the _",
    "self - stirring _ scenario proposed by @xcite , the gradual build - up of large planetesimals via collisional coagulation of smaller bodies eventually leads to an enhanced dust production .",
    "according to this model , the emergent largest planetesimals ( `` oligarchs '' ) perturb the orbits of neighbouring smaller bodies , increasing their inclination and eccentricities .",
    "this results in destructive collisions and initiates a collisional cascade . in a specific disc region the peak dust production roughly coincides with the formation of @xmath11000  km radius ( @xmath1pluto - sized ) planetesimals . alternatively , in the _ planetary or binary stirring _",
    "scenario @xcite , a giant planet or a stellar companion triggers the collisions . in this case",
    ", the companion can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals via secular perturbations even if the companion is located far from the planetesimals .",
    "self - stirring is an inside - out process , i.e. the collisional cascade is ignited in the inner disc first and then the active dust production propagates outward .",
    "the same is true for planetary stirring if the perturber is located closer to the star than the planetesimal belt .",
    "_ stellar flybys _ can also initiate more energetic collisions between planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the scarcity of stellar encounters among old field stars , however , suggests that this mechanism is likely limited to debris systems located in dense young clusters @xcite .",
    "very little is known about the relative contributions of self - stirring and planetary stirring in observed debris systems .",
    "@xcite concluded that the observational statistics provided by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ ( hereafter _ spitzer _ ) for debris discs around a - type stars can be reproduced by simulating the evolution of a sample of discs assuming either self - stirring or planetary stirring . although the importance of the different mechanisms can not be established by studying the whole debris population , there are some individual systems where self - stirring can be excluded with high probability . in self - stirring models ,",
    "the pace of the outward propagation of the formation of 1000  km - sized planetesimals depends on the disc mass : the more massive the disc initially , the faster the outwards spread .",
    "therefore , the existence of dust - producing planetesimals at large stellocentric radii around a relatively young star would require an unrealistically massive initial protoplanetary disc .",
    "in these cases , planetary stirring by an inner planet is a natural candidate because its timescale in the outer disc could be faster than that of the growth of large planetesimals needed for self - stirring .",
    "indeed , based on this consideration , @xcite identified debris discs around two young moving group members where self - stirring is unlikely .",
    "the location of the dust grains in a debris disc is generally estimated from their temperature and the star s luminosity , assuming thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , the temperature of a dust grain depends not only on its distance from the star , but also on its size and optical properties .",
    "because of this well known degeneracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can not provide an unambiguous picture on the spatial distribution of dust in debris systems . to break this degeneracy and to estimate the location of the emitting grains reliably and precisely ,",
    "spatially resolved images are needed .",
    "due to the unprecedented spatial resolution ( 611 ) and sensitivity of the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "( hereafter _ herschel , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at far - infrared ( far - ir ) wavelengths , the number of resolved debris discs increased significantly in the last few years @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that disc sizes derived from resolved images are generally 24 times larger than those inferred from sed analysis assuming blackbody grains ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we report on our _ herschel _ observations of 11 debris discs , where young age and an earlier estimate of disc size from previous infrared observations hinted for stirring mechanisms other than self - stirring .",

    "our results do not mean that self - stirring is the only possible explanation for the seven mentioned objects in our sample .",

    "in order to check how robust are the conclusions concerning these debris discs , one can test how sensitive are the outcomes of the self - stirring model on its basic assumptions .",

    "we recalculated the model curves in fig .  [ stirring ] considering these modifications , and found that hd9672 , hd21997 , hd16743 and hd95086 , as well as , @xmath0pic and hr8799 are still outliers . in the previous analyses",
    "the initiation of dust production at a given radius was linked to the formation of @xmath11000 km size bodies .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the cascade is already initiated at smaller sizes , once the largest oligarchs reach sizes of 500 km .",
    "unfortunately , they offered no formulae for the formation of bodies smaller than 1000 km .",
    "their fig .  8 and 9 suggest that the outer front where the largest bodies are @xmath1500 km is at most 30 - 40% larger than the site where 1000 km sized planetesimals are formed . considering our conservative approach in determining the outer size of the planetesimal belt ( sect .  [ location ] ) , the above arguments probably will not change our conclusions .",
    "the initial size distribution of the first planetesimals is very little constrained by current models in the literature @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed turbulent concentration and gravitational clumping models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict significantly larger initial planetesimal sizes ( @xmath2100 km ) than the classical coagulation model utilized by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , @xcite tested different intial planetesimal sizes , however , they used uniform size distribution and not an ensemble .",
    "moreover , the maximum planetesimal size was only 100 km , while graviturbulent processes can produce planetesimals with a size of 1000 km or even larger bodies especially in discs with large initial mass @xcite .",
    "if the latter processes produce an ensemble of smaller planetesimals that can be stirred by the largest ones , then the collisional cascade can be started earlier than in the standard coagulation model .",
    "this phenomenon might help to produce very extended , young discs within the framework of self - stirring scenario .",
    "the detailed investigation of this case is out of the scope of the present paper .    in the following",
    "we will investigate whether alternative stirring mechanisms could explain the formation of the six outlier debris discs .",

    "depending on the planet s orbital parameters and mass , its secular perturbation could excite planetesimal eccentricities , starting a collisional fragmentation at a given radius faster than the time needed for the growth of 1000 km size bodies .",

    "whether in a given system the hypothetical planet can affect the planetesimals even at the observed outer disc radius via secular perturbations depends on its mass ( @xmath74 ) , and semi - major axis ( @xmath72 ) , and eccentricity . in our seven older systems with ages of @xmath250myr ,",
