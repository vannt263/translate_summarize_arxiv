    "the conception of quantum weak measurement was introduced by aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav ) in 1988  @xcite .",
    "their theory is based on the von neumann measurement with a very weak coupling between two quantum systems  @xcite , for example , the weak spin - orbit coupling of electrons in the stern - gerlach ( sg ) device .",
    "a key feature of the weak measurement is that the observable quantity ( acting as the pointer ) is measured in a certain subensemble , for example , measuring the expectation value of the electrons position with the postselected spin state @xmath0 .",
    "this measurement leads to an interesting result that the pointer has a shift proportional to the value @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the initial state and the observable operator of the spin system .",
    "@xmath4 is the so - called weak value .",
    "compared to the strong measurement @xmath5 , the weak value provides an improved approach to detect @xmath3 , and some interesting phenomena result .",
    "recently , the weak value has attracted much interest because it could be arranged to amplify some weak signals  @xcite .",
    "it is also used to study the foundational questions of quantum mechanics  @xcite , such as hardy s paradox  @xcite , the leggett - garg inequality  @xcite , heisenberg s uncertainty relation  @xcite , and the wave - particle correlation  @xcite . regarding the physical implementations ,",
    "most of the previous studies used the light both as the pointer and the measured system  @xcite .",
    "there are several interesting works implementing weak measurement using the condensed - matter system , e.g. , the quantum dot  @xcite , the superconducting phase qubit  @xcite , and the semiconducting aharonov - bohm interferometer  @xcite .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the weak measurement of a cold - atom system based on the dynamics of spontaneous emission .    in this article , the weak measurement is applied to the system of atom - cavity interaction . in such a system , the cavity electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) have predicted many nonclassical phenomena such as the famous vacuum rabi oscillation  @xcite and the vacuum rabi splitting  @xcite .",
    "these effects concern the cavity - induced changes in the internal electron s states of atoms .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown that the light in a cavity can significantly affect the atom s center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "motions , for example , kapitza - dirac scattering  @xcite .",
    "this effect is due to the atom stimulated emitting and absorbing photon in the cavity ( resulting in a momentum change in the atom ) .",
    "it can be found that a vacuum cavity can also generate a similar transverse effect of a neutral atom via the virtual excitation of a photon .",
    "here , we propose a weak value amplification ( wva ) setup to observe such an interesting nonclassical effect of vacuum .",
    "after the atom - cavity interaction , we perform a single - qubit operation on the two internal states of atoms and postselected on an internal state . then , we obtain a weak value ; its real and imaginary parts determine , respectively , the shifts of the average momentum and the position of the atoms external motions .",
    "consequently , the controllable weak value could be used to amplify the vacuum - induced transverse shifts of atoms .",
    "it is shown that the present wva could offer some certain advantages for experimentally detecting the weak transverse effects of atoms .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the vacuum - induced weak coupling between the internal and external motions of free atoms .",
    "this coupling acts as a force to push the neutral atoms moving transversely . in sec .",
    "iii , we get the desirable weak value using the single - qubit operation and postselection and use it to amplify the transverse shifts of atoms . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the physical meaning of wva .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "following the original work of aav , we consider the weak measurement experiment as showing in fig .  1 .",
    "the spatially coherent atoms , e.g. , a released bec  @xcite , are injected into the equipment through a pinhole located about the point of @xmath6 .",
    "this pinhole selects a part of the matter wave , and thus the positional uncertainty of the selected atoms is on the order of the size of pinhole .",
    "hence , one can use the typical gaussian wave - packet to describe the spatially coherent atoms ( after the pinhole ) . in @xmath7-direction",
    ", the gaussian state reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] is the probability - amplitude of position eigenstate @xmath10 and @xmath11 describes the root - mean - square ( rms ) width of the wave - packet . of course",
    ", the state ( 2 ) can be also written as @xmath12 with the momentum eigenstate @xmath13 and the gaussian function @xmath14^{1/4}\\exp(-\\delta^2p^2/\\hbar^2)$ ] .",
    "for this gaussian state , the expectation value of position is @xmath15 and its uncertainty reads @xmath16 .",
    "the average momentum along @xmath7 direction is @xmath17 and its uncertainty reads @xmath18 .",
    "physically , the uncertainty @xmath11 ( or @xmath19 ) determines the main distribution range of particles positions ( or momentums ) . out of this range ,",
    "the probability to find the particles is negligible .",
    "below , we study the vacuum field ( in the cavity 1 ) induced change on the initial wave packet @xmath20 within a very short duration ( i.e. , the free diffraction of atom is negligible ) .    , and",
    "pass through a pinhole with momentum along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the vacuum field ( with the @xmath7-directional gradient ) in cavity @xmath22 generates a weak coupling between the atoms internal states and the external @xmath7-directional motions .",
    "cavity @xmath23 , with classical light , resonantly excites atoms and generates the desirable single - qubit operation @xmath24 .",
    "the applied voltage @xmath25 ionizes the atoms in excited state ( similar to the procedure in the experiments of haroche group  @xcite ) and leave the ground state atoms to be detected .",
    "in the selected ensemble of ground state , the atoms have a shift ( along @xmath7 direction ) of the average position on the deposition plate .",
    "this shift can be described by the so - called weak value , which depends on the pre - selection @xmath26 and the single - qubit operation @xmath24 .",
    ", width=529 ]    in cavity @xmath22 , the quantized field of a mode takes the form  @xcite @xmath27 which excites the incoming atoms . here ,",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the polarization - vector , amplitude , and wave - number of the standing wave ( such as the first excited mode ) . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the creation and annihilation operators of the corresponding cavity mode ( with frequency @xmath33 ) .",
    "we consider the microwave excitation of the two - level rydberg atoms .",
    "although the orbit radius of rydberg states are very large ( about @xmath34 atomic units  @xcite ) , they are far smaller than the wavelength of the microwave cavity ( on the order of centimeter ) . therefore , in the atomic internal region the driving field ( 3 ) can be regarded as uniform . performing the dipole approximation ,",
    "the interaction between the atom and cavity field reads @xmath35 with the so - called rabi frequency @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "where , @xmath37 is the planck constant divided by @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the transition operator of the two - level atom with the ground state @xmath40 and the exciting state @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the transition matrix element of the two - level atom .",
    "we consider @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the hamiltonian ( 4 ) can be approximately written as @xmath45 with the constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 . here , we have used the well - known trigonometric function @xmath48 and neglected the high order of @xmath49 .",
    "note that , @xmath50 means that the range of atomic motion in @xmath7 direction is much smaller than the wave length of the cavity mode .",
    "the range of @xmath7 depends on the initial uncertainty @xmath11 , and the wave packet spread ( i.e. , the diffraction ) . as mentioned earlier , the diffraction of the atom is negligible as the duration of the cavity - atom interaction is very short , i.e. , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the mass of atom ) .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath7 is on the order of its initial uncertainty @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xmath53 m ) , which can be much smaller than the wave length of cavity mode ( about @xmath22  cm  @xcite ) .    with the interaction ( 5 )",
    ", the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath54 in the hilbert space of momentum eigenstates . in this space ,",
    "the position operator is given by @xmath55 .",
    "physically , the first term in the right hand of eq .",
    "( 6 ) describes the cm motion of the free atom .",
    "the second term describes the atomic two internal levels ( by the pauli operator @xmath56 and the transition frequency @xmath57 ) .",
    "the third term is the free hamiltonian of the cavity ground mode .",
    "the last term describes the coupling between the considered three degrees of freedom , i.e. , a position - dependent jaynes - cummings interaction . in the rotating frame defined by @xmath58",
    "$ ] , the hamiltonian ( 6 ) can be written as @xmath59 with such a transform , the free term @xmath60 is eliminated .",
    "considering the atom rapidly crosses the cavity ( i.e. , the effective interaction duration @xmath61 is sufficiently short ) , there is an impulse atom - cavity interaction corresponding to the von neumann measurement  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath62 , and the hamiltonian ( 7 ) reduces to @xmath63 performing an unitary transformation of @xmath64 $ ] , the hamiltonian ( 8) further reduces to @xmath65 with the detuning @xmath66 and the operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 . here , the usual rotating wave approximation is performed , i.e. , the terms relating to the sum - frequency @xmath69 have been neglected .",
    "the time - evolution operator for the hamiltonian ( 9 ) can be given by the dyson - series : @xmath70 under the conditions of large detuning : @xmath71 , the above time - evolution operator can be approximately written as @xmath72 with the effective hamiltonian @xmath73 .",
    "considering the cavity is in the vacuum state @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 , the effective hamiltonian reduces to @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "this hamiltonian just describes a position - dependent vacuum rabi splitting  @xcite , and the parameter @xmath78 describes the coupling strength between the internal and external motions of atom .",
    "numerically , considering the wave length @xmath79  cm of the cavity mode and the rabi frequency @xmath80khz  @xcite , we have @xmath81  khz with @xmath82 , and consequently @xmath83  khz with @xmath84 .",
    "of course , as detuning @xmath85 increased , the coupling strength @xmath78 decreased significantly .",
    "in the following , we will show that the vacuum - induced interaction ( 12 ) can generate a small shift to the initial wave packet @xmath86 , and this displacement can be amplified by using the weak value technique . in the momentum space , the evolved state of atom can be written as @xmath87 , with @xmath26 being the initial state of atomic qubit .",
    "we rewrite the initial gaussian wave function as @xmath88 with the dimensionless number @xmath89 .",
    "then , we have @xmath90 by using the relation @xmath91 . here ,",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 are the dimensionless coupling parameters , and @xmath94 . considering @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 , the state ( 13 ) can be approximately written as @xmath97 for simplicity , we re - define @xmath98 being the initial internal state of the atoms ( which can be prepared by the well - known single qubit operations ) . here , @xmath99 is the phase of the superposition state , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the superposition coefficients ( real number ) satisfying the normalized condition @xmath102 .",
    "immediately , we have the state evolution @xmath103 , and consequently the expectation value of atom s momentum reads @xmath104 this equation means that , the vacuum in cavity @xmath22 generates a transverse shift @xmath105 to the average momentum of atoms . because @xmath106 , the shift @xmath107 for a very weak coupling of @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , one can easily calculate the expectation value @xmath15 of the atomic position .",
    "these results indicate that the weak coupling @xmath109 can generate significant changes neither on the observable @xmath110 nor @xmath111 .",
    "we now use the weak value technique to amplify the shifts @xmath112 and @xmath111 .",
    "first , we preform a single - qubit operation @xmath113 to the state ( 14 ) with the controllable parameter @xmath114 . alternatively",
    ", this single - qubit operation can be realized by the classical resonant light , as it shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have the final state @xmath115\\phi(\\tilde{p})|i\\rangle\\ , . \\end{array}\\ ] ] second , we post - select an eigenstate of the atomic qubit , e.g. @xmath40 , and immediately the external motion of atoms collapses on the wave function : @xmath116 with @xmath117 here , we have used the relation @xmath118 with @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath4 is our weak value , although it dos not satisfy the standard definement of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . this will be explained in the sec .",
    "iv .. physically , the post - selection of @xmath40 could be realized by the field - ionization  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath41 and @xmath40 have the different ionization energies , the ionization is state selective . supposing the atoms only in exciting state @xmath41 are effectively ionized by the applied moderate electric field , and then the exciting state atoms will be accelerated in @xmath120 direction and discarded .",
    "however , the ground state atoms will arrive the plate to be finally detected , as it shown in fig .",
    "1 .    considering the weak interaction , i.e. , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the wave function ( 17 ) can be approximately written as @xmath123 here , the high orders of @xmath109 have been neglected , and @xmath124 and @xmath125 are respectively the real and imaginary parts of @xmath4 . with this approximation , the probability for successfully post - selecting @xmath40 reads @xmath126 . according to eq .",
    "( 19 ) , we have the expectation value of momentum : @xmath127 this means that , within the post - selected sub - ensemble the shift of average momentum @xmath128 is proportional to the real part of the weak value . on the other hand , in the position presentation , the wave function ( 19 ) reads @xmath129 and consequently the expectation value of positions reads @xmath130 this indicates that , within the post - selected sub - ensemble the shift of average position @xmath131 is proportional to the imaginary - part of the weak value .    due to the single - qubit operations @xmath132 and @xmath133 , our weak value reads @xmath134 with @xmath135 $ ] and @xmath136 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath137 @xmath138 these values could be as large as we want by properly adjusting the parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "for example , if @xmath141 and @xmath142 , then @xmath143 . if @xmath144 and @xmath145 , then @xmath146 . with these enlarged weak values , the weak interaction of @xmath109 could significantly change the transverse cm motions of atoms via the basic equations : @xmath147 @xmath148 we would like to emphasize that the shifts @xmath149 and @xmath150 can not be infinitely amplified , as the weak values were obtained under the weak interaction condition of @xmath122 .",
    "that is , the amplified displacements of average position and momentum are limited in the regimes of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "hence , the present amplification effects are significant just for the weak interaction of @xmath108 .",
    "there is a cost of wva .",
    "the probability @xmath126 for successfully post - selecting @xmath40 decreases rapidly with the increasing @xmath124 or @xmath125 , so that the more significant amplification needs more atoms . in the term of metrology , the wva may be suboptimal for parameter estimation since many atoms ( information ) were discarded  @xcite . however",
    ", in the practical experimental systems the discarded atoms may bring also noises into the final detection . as it pointed by the previous refs .",
    "@xcite , the wva can offer some certain technical advantages , for example , suppressing the systematic errors  @xcite or avoiding the detectors saturation  @xcite .    in the present system",
    ", it would be very difficult to precisely scan the position- or momentum - distribution of final atoms .",
    "possibly , one can place two atoms - detectors ( such as the hot - wire ionizers  @xcite ) at the symmetrical positions @xmath7 and @xmath153 to estimate the transverse effects of atoms . in the unit time",
    ", the expected atoms - counting in detectors are given by @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "@xmath156 is the total number of inputted atoms in the unit time , @xmath157 is the atoms - collecting region of detectors . according to @xmath158 and @xmath159 ,",
    "we have @xmath160 with @xmath161 . above",
    ", the high orders of @xmath109 have been neglected , and @xmath162 can be regarded as the signal of atoms transverse shift .",
    "we note that @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and consequently @xmath162 are the expectation values . in practice",
    ", the experimental results may take @xmath163 ( with the index @xmath164 ) and consequently the equation ( 28 ) is replaced by @xmath165 .",
    "@xmath166 is the detection efficiency of the atoms - detectors .",
    "there are two kinds of errors in measurements , namely systematic error @xmath167 and random error @xmath168 .",
    "certainly , the wva does not offer advantages for suppressing the random error since the inputted atoms were reduced by the post - selection  @xcite .",
    "however , it can be found that the wva is very useful for suppressing the systematic error which is proportional to the number of atoms , i.e. , @xmath169 with @xmath170 being a small uncertainty coefficient .",
    "this systematic error arises perhaps because of the unsteady detection efficiency of the atom detector , the uncertain location of the detector , etc .",
    "here , we give a brief discussion on the physical meaningful of the wva . in the original work of aav",
    "@xcite , there are two sg devices .",
    "the first one is used to generate a weak coupling between the spin and orbit of electron , and the second one is arranged to preform the post - selection of the electron s spin states .",
    "the present weak measurement processing is similar to that of aav .",
    "the cavity @xmath22 plays an atomic sg device to implement the coupling between the internal qubit and the external cm orbital motion of atom .",
    "the cavity @xmath23 acts as the second sg device of aav for coherently manipulating the atoms .",
    "after the cavity @xmath22 the atom is in the state ( 14 ) , which can be written as the standard form of @xmath171 , with @xmath172 and @xmath173 . using the orthonormal eigenstates",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 of the two - levels atom , @xmath174 can be further written as : @xmath175 here , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "obviously , eq .  ( 29 ) represses an entangled state . if the internal state @xmath40 is measured , then the external motion of atom collapses on the wave function @xmath180 ; whereas if the state @xmath41 is measured , the atom collapses on @xmath181 .",
    "these measurements preformed on the qubit are just the well - known projective measurements @xmath182 and @xmath183 . and the outcomes of @xmath184 and @xmath185 can be regarded as the weak values since they take the same form of eq .",
    "however , it can be found that @xmath186 and @xmath187 because @xmath172 , so that they can not realize the desirable amplification functions , whatever the initial state @xmath2 is .",
    "we note that , @xmath184 and @xmath185 are both real .",
    "hence , applying directly the projective measurements to the state ( 29 ) can not yield the effect of positional shifts of atoms , as it mentioned early .",
    "comparing to the projective measurement , the weak measurement due to the post - selection @xmath188 is a more general conception , because the state @xmath0 is beyond the eigenstates of the system . how can a coherent superposition of the eigenstates be realized ? in aav",
    "s proposal , the desired post - selection is implemented by the second sg device .",
    "it couples the spin to the @xmath120-directional orbital motion of electron ( the third degree of freedom of electron ) .",
    "and consequently one can select the @xmath120-directional motions ( via the strong measurement ) to realize a post - selection of the superposition state of spin ( see , e.g. , the ref .",
    "@xcite which discussed detailedly the aav s idea ) . in the recent optics experiments",
    "@xcite , the post - selection is realized by a polarizer which is oriented at a certain angle and then selects the desirable superposition state of polarization of light .    here , the cavity @xmath23 together with the ionization electrodes just realized an operation @xmath189 to the state ( 29 ) . and",
    "the weak value ( 18 ) can be written as the standard form of @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "this weak value can be as large as we want , such as @xmath192 .",
    "physically , the present weak value can be regarded as an outcome of the coherent operation @xmath24 .",
    "it can be found that the standard post - selection also implies the coherent operations , by writing @xmath193 with the unitary evolution operator @xmath194 and the eigenstate @xmath40 of any systems .",
    "in this theoretical work , we have shown that a vacuum microwave cavity can shift the neutral atoms to move transversely .",
    "this non - classical effect is due to the vacuum - induced coupling between the internal and external motions of free atoms , i.e. , a position - dependent vacuum rabi splitting .",
    "we further showed that the present effect could be amplified by the weak value technique .",
    "after the atom - cavity coupling , we preformed a single - qubit rotation on the atomic internal states and consequently post - selected an internal eigenstate ( strong measurement ) .",
    "then , we obtained a weak value which was used to amplify the vacuum - induced shift of the average position or momentum of atoms .",
    "technically , the present wva could offers advantages in the practical experiment systems for observing the weak transverse effect of atoms , such as suppressing the systematic error of detectors .",
    "physically , our wva is a quantum - mechanical effect due to the necessary single - qubit operation . finally , we hope the present studies could encourage the further studies on the weak measurements and cavity - qed .      99 y. aharonov , d. z. albert , and l. vaidman , phys . rev . lett . * 60 * , 1351 ( 1988 ) .",
