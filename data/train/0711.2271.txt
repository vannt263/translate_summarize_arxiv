    "in previous work @xcite we have investigated quantum gravity in @xmath0 dimensions with negative cosmological constant on the torus , using an approach involving quantum holonomy matrices .",
    "this followed on from earlier work by one of us with regge and zertuche @xcite based on the traces of the holonomies . in @xcite we focused on the quantum geometry that arises from introducing a constant quantum connection , from which the holonomy matrices and their traces are obtained ( in the sector where these matrices are diagonal ) .",
    "some interesting features emerged , in particular a quantum version of the well - known goldman bracket for loops on a surface . in the present article",
    "we describe some new developments in the understanding of this quantum geometrical picture .",
    "the classical action of @xmath0 gravity with negative cosmological constant @xmath2 , in the dreibein formulation , was related by witten @xcite to chern - simons theory for the gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "thus the classical phase space of this model of @xmath0 gravity corresponds to the moduli space of flat @xmath3 connections on the spatial manifold , which we take to be the torus @xmath4 . treating each @xmath5 factor",
    "separately , we are then led to consider pairs of commuting @xmath5 matrices ( up to simultaneous conjugation by an element of @xmath5 ) , representing the holonomies of the flat connection along two generating cycles of the torus ( up to gauge transformation ) .",
    "note that the fundamental group of the torus is generated by two cycles , with a single relation saying that the generators commute . for a detailed description of the moduli space of flat @xmath5 connections on the torus ,",
    "see @xcite .    the diagonal sector of this moduli space",
    "can be parametrised by constant connections @xcite on the torus of the form a= ( r_1 dx + r_2 dy ) (    clcr 1 & 0 + 0 & -1    ) [ conn ] where @xmath6 are coordinates on the torus ( with periodicity @xmath7 ) , or on its covering space @xmath8 .",
    "the connections are constant in the sense that the functions @xmath9 are constant functions ( independent of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) . after integration ,",
    "this yields the holonomies : u_i = _ _",
    "i a = (    clcre^r_i & 0 + 0 & e^- r_i    ) i=1,2 [ hol1 ] where @xmath12 are generating cycles of the fundamental group of the torus",
    ".    in chern - simons theory components of the connection @xmath13 have non - trivial poisson brackets amongst themselves . at the level of the connection components @xmath14",
    "this translates into the poisson bracket \\ { r_1 , r_2 } = - , which is quantised by @xmath15 = \\frac{i\\hbar \\sqrt{-\\lambda}}{4}. \\label{rcommrel}\\ ] ] therefore we will consider a quantised phase space parametrised by constant quantum connections of the form : = ( _ 1 dx + _ 2 dy ) (    ll 1 & 0 + 0 & -1    ) .",
    "[ quconn ]    after integration along the generating cycles the wilson loops , i.e. traces of the holonomies , of this connection are precisely the variables used by nelson and regge @xcite .",
    "this connection also yields the description in terms of quantum holonomy matrices of nelson and picken @xcite .",
    "we remark also that the relation between the parameters @xmath9 ( a pair for each @xmath5 factor ) and the adm variables for @xmath0 gravity has been elucidated in @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to further explore the quantum geometry arising from the assignment of a quantum matrix ( or its trace ) to a general class of loops on the torus .",
    "it is convenient to identify loops on the torus @xmath16 with paths on its covering space @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore consider all loops on the torus as being represented by piecewise - linear ( pl ) paths between integer points on the @xmath17 plane , and work with this description , bearing in mind that paths upstairs i.e. in @xmath1 represent loops downstairs i.e. on the torus @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , a natural class of paths @xmath18 to consider are those straight paths that start at the origin and end at an integer point @xmath19 . they will be denoted @xmath20 . using the quantum connection we assign a quantum matrix to any such straight path by _",
    "( m , n)= _ ( m , n ) = (    ll e^m_1 + n_2 & 0 + 0 & e^-m_1 -n_2    ) . [ umn ] this assignment is straightforwardly extended to any pl path between integer points by assigning a quantum matrix to each linear segment of the path , in an analogous fashion to , and multiplying the matrices in the same order as the segments appear along the path .",
    "this prescription obviously coincides with the general relation : p_p = p _ p . [ hol ] where @xmath21 denotes path - ordering .    in the upstairs picture , two homotopic loops on the torus",
    "are represented by two pl paths on the plane , @xmath22 , with the same integer starting point and the same integer endpoint .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the following relationship holds for the respective quantum matrices : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the signed area enclosed between the paths @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27    the signed area between two such pl paths is defined as follows : for any finite region @xmath28 enclosed by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , if the boundary of @xmath28 consists of oriented segments of @xmath25 and @xmath29 ( the orientation reversal of @xmath26 ) , and as such is globally oriented in the positive ( anticlockwise ) , or negative ( clockwise ) sense , this gives a contribution of @xmath30 , or @xmath31 respectively , to the signed sum @xmath24 ( otherwise the contribution is zero ) .",
    "see figure [ signedarea ] .",
    "the signed area between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the area of the the horizontally shaded region minus the area of the vertically shaded region ]    we note for the discussion in the next sections that the wilson loops , or traces of the holonomies , are related by the same `` area phases '' , i.e. @xmath32 where @xmath33 .    in @xcite this relation between the holonomy matrices for homotopic loops / paths",
    "was interpreted as a @xmath34-deformed surface group representation , i.e. a deformation of a representation of the fundamental group in terms of matrices .",
    "there we used the fact that signed area between paths has the following two properties : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the concatenation of paths @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "another perspective on this comes from recent work by one of us with martins @xcite , where the notion of @xmath37-dimensional holonomy was explored . in the present context , @xmath37-dimensional holonomy",
    "may be described as the assignment of an element of a group @xmath38 to each of a pair of homotopic loops , and simultaneously the assignment of an element of a group @xmath39 to the homotopy between the two loops , subject to certain consistency relations . amongst these relations",
    ", there is the requirement that the elements assigned to the homotopies behave well under vertical and horizontal composition , which translates precisely to the properties of signed area as in .",
    "we note also that a crucial ingredient in the construction of @xcite is a connection @xmath37-form with values in the lie algebra of @xmath39 , and indeed in the present context there is a natural @xmath37-form , namely the non - vanishing curvature of the connection ( non - vanishing because of the non - commutativity of the components @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "thus there are strong hints that the quantum holonomies of @xmath0 gravity may be interpreted in terms of @xmath37-dimensional holonomy .",
    "when analysing the behaviour of the wilson loops @xmath33 for the quantum connection in @xcite a link with the goldman bracket @xcite emerged .",
    "this bracket is a poisson bracket for functions @xmath42 , defined on homotopy classes of loops on a surface , which for @xmath43 takes the following form ( see @xcite thm . 3.14 , 3.15 and remark ( 2 ) , p. 284 ) : \\{t(_1 ) , t(_2 ) } = _ s _ 1 _ 2 ( _ 1,_2,s)(t(_1s_2 ) - t(_1s_2 ^ -1 ) ) .",
    "[ gold ] here @xmath44 denotes the set of ( transversal ) intersection points of @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the intersection number of @xmath45 and @xmath46 at the intersection point @xmath48 , i.e. ( for simple intersections ) @xmath49 if the angle between the tangent vector of @xmath45 at @xmath48 and the tangent vector of @xmath46 at @xmath48 is between @xmath50 and @xmath51 degrees , and @xmath52 if it is between @xmath51 and @xmath53 degrees .",
    "finally @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote loops which are _ rerouted _ at the intersection point @xmath48 , meaning that we follow @xmath45 as far as the intersection point @xmath48 , then follow @xmath46 ( or the inverse loop @xmath56 ) from @xmath48 back to @xmath48 , and finally proceed along @xmath45 from @xmath48 back to the starting point of @xmath45 . for a fuller discussion and",
    "examples see section 5 of @xcite .",
    "we found that the wilson loops @xmath57 , for @xmath20 a straight path corresponding to a loop on the torus , satisfied a quantum version of the goldman relation .",
    "in fact two different quantisations emerged , a straightforward one , and a refined one , which we will now describe .",
    "first , for straight paths @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the goldman bracket takes the form : \\{t(m , n ) , t(s , t ) } = ( mt - ns ) ( t(m+s , n+t)- t(m - s , n - t ) ) .",
    "[ straightforward ] here @xmath60 is the total intersection number between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and this factor appears because there are effectively @xmath60 simple intersection points and the corresponding reroutings @xmath61 are all homotopic to the straight path @xmath62 , with an analogous statement for the negative reroutings @xmath63 .    by a simple direct calculation ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the wilson loops satisfy : @xmath64= ( q^{\\frac{mt - ns}{2}}-q^{-\\frac{mt - ns}{2 } } ) \\left(\\hat{t}(m+s , n+t ) - \\hat{t}(m - s , n - t)\\right ) \\label{qgb1}\\ ] ] i.e. a quantisation of , with the total intersection number @xmath60 replaced by a quantum total intersection number ( the first factor on the r.h.s . of ) .",
    "we will call this the straightfward quantisation of the goldman bracket .",
    "a more refined quantisation was also obtained in @xcite , where each rerouting appears as a separate term , and the area phases of these different but homotopic reroutings are taken into acccount .",
    "this takes the following form : = _ s p_1",
    "p_2 ( q^(p_1,p_2,s ) - 1)(p_1sp_2 ) + ( q^-(p_1,p_2,s ) - 1)(p_1sp_2 ^ -1 ) [ qgold ] which quantises ( with loops @xmath65 substituted by paths @xmath18 ) by replacing the intersection numbers @xmath66 by quantum intersection numbers @xmath67 .",
    "an example is given by the choice @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where the refined bracket is given by = _",
    "s = p , r , q ( q^-1 -1 ) ( ( 1,2)s(2,1 ) ) + ( q-1 ) ( ( 1,2)s(-2,-1 ) ) , [ qgoldexp ] where the terms on the r.h.s .",
    "come from the positive and negative reroutings at three intersection points denoted @xmath70 , see figure [ p20a ] .",
    "we then calculate the area phases of each rerouting relative to the corresponding straight path @xmath71 or @xmath72 , and using we obtain : @xmath73 & = & ( q^{-1}-1)(q^{\\frac{3}{2 } } + q^{\\frac{1}{2 } } + q^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } ) \\hat{t}(3,3 ) + ( q-1 ) ( q^{-\\frac{3}{2 } } + q^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } + q^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ) \\hat{t}(-1,1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( q^{-\\frac{3}{2 } } - q^{\\frac{3}{2 } } ) ( \\hat{t}(3,3 ) - \\hat{t}(-1,1)).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. the straightforward form of this commutator .     and",
    "@xmath74 for @xmath75 , title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]   and @xmath74 for @xmath75 , title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    in the next section we describe some new insights which allow a better understanding of intersections and reroutings , and prepare the way to address some outstanding issues concerning the two quantisations and ( see the final section ) .",
    "in @xcite we observed that the paths that appear after rerouting two straight paths at an intersection point all pass through an integer point in the parallelogram spanned by the two paths . here",
    "we will show from a new viewpoint that this is necessarily the case , and we shall see that it is also a very useful way to examine the nature of the reroutings .",
    "we look at reroutings of the type @xmath76 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are both straight paths in @xmath8 starting at the origin , corresponding to loops on the torus @xmath77 .",
    "this means that we follow @xmath25 up to the intersection point @xmath28 , reroute along @xmath26 starting at the point @xmath28 until @xmath26 returns to @xmath28 , and complete the remainder of the first path @xmath25 from @xmath28 back to the origin .",
    "note that the intersection point @xmath28 may occur at the origin of @xmath8 ; in that case we follow @xmath26 straight away . instead of studying the intersections between @xmath25 and @xmath26 by reducing both paths to a fundamental domain , as we did in @xcite , we work directly in @xmath8 .",
    "fix the path @xmath25 and parallel translate @xmath26 to start at a new integer point , denoted @xmath78 , in such a way that it intersects @xmath25 at @xmath28 .",
    "of course , all integer points are the same when projecting down to the torus , but this shift of @xmath26 gives a very clear picture of where @xmath28 is located along both paths simultaneously .",
    "we introduce the following notation for paths on the plane : @xmath79 denotes the subpath of the path @xmath18 going from the point @xmath13 on @xmath18 to the point @xmath80 on @xmath18 . also for any path @xmath18 , let @xmath81 denote the integer endpoint of @xmath18 .",
    "note that for straight paths @xmath20 , the notation for the endpoint and for the path itself coincide , i.e. @xmath82 , but when the path is non - straight , there is a distinction between @xmath18 and @xmath81 .",
    "this latter situation will occur when we try and extend the refined bracket to non - straight paths - see the outstanding issues listed in the final section .",
    "now write @xmath83 , to indicate how @xmath25 is divided into two segments by the intersection point @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath25 starts at the origin @xmath50 , but the parallel translated @xmath26 starts at the integer point @xmath78 , so we require a notation to describe the shift or parallel translation of paths to start at different points : @xmath84 will denote the path @xmath18 parallel translated to start at @xmath78 instead of its original starting point .",
    "( of course , projected down to the torus , the original @xmath18 going from the origin to an integer point , and the shifted path @xmath84 give rise to identical loops ) . in this way ,",
    "we can write down an explicit algebraic expression for the rerouting @xmath76 represented as a path in the plane ( see figure [ rerouting ] ) : @xmath85 where the start and endpoints @xmath78 and @xmath86 of @xmath87 are related by : @xmath88 .     the rerouting @xmath76 ]    this detailed notation for rerouted paths should prove useful in the future for manipulating paths algebraically and making precise general statements",
    ". however the approach in this section also makes it very clear why intersections occur and how they give rise to reroutings . in concrete terms , for an intersection to occur , we need either a starting point @xmath78 for @xmath87 such that @xmath87 intersects @xmath25 in a point @xmath28 ( which may be the origin , but not the endpoint of @xmath25 ) , or equivalently we need an endpoint @xmath86 such that the appropriate @xmath87 ending in @xmath86 intersects @xmath25 in a point @xmath28 as before .    looking first at the possible starting points @xmath78 , we see that they are the integer points lying in a `` pre - parallelogram '' with vertices @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and the origin @xmath50",
    ". see figure [ preparallelogram ] .",
    "here we should exclude any integer points lying on the edge between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , since the corresponding paths @xmath87 intersect @xmath25 at its endpoint , and we should also exclude any integer points lying on the edge between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , to avoid double counting , as we are including the integer points lying along the edge between @xmath50 and @xmath91 .     the parallelogram and pre - parallelogram ( dotted line ) for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , showing some of the integer points ( black dots ) and the corresponding parallel - translated copies of @xmath26 ]    equivalently , we can look at the endpoints @xmath86 lying inside the parallelogram generated by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. with vertices @xmath50 , @xmath91 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . here",
    "we will exclude the integer points lying on the edge between @xmath91 and @xmath95 and those lying along the edge between @xmath50 and @xmath91 ( these endpoints correspond to the starting points we excluded from the pre - parallelogram ) .",
    "from both perspectives we can readily verify that the number of intersections is correct , since the total intersection number is : @xmath96 the total number of intersection points ( counting multiplicities ) , all of which have the same sign of the intersection number , is therefore the modulus of @xmath97 , i.e. in geometric terms , the area of the parallelogram or the pre - parallelogram . in turn , this area is given by a classical theorem of pick @xcite , which states that the area @xmath98 of a planar polygon @xmath99 with vertices at integer points of the plane is given in terms of the number of interior integer points @xmath100 and the number of boundary integer points @xmath101 as follows : @xmath102 this value is evidently the same as the number of integer starting points @xmath78 in the pre - parallelogram , or equivalently the number of integer end points @xmath86 in the parallelogram generated by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , since we have excluded two edges , i.e. half the integer points lying along the interior of the edges and three out of four of the vertices ( this is accounted for by the @xmath52 in the formula , since @xmath103 , the single remaining vertex ) .",
    "a convenient feature of this approach is that it handles reducible paths in a natural manner .",
    "a reducible path is one such that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 are all integers , with @xmath106 .",
    "if @xmath26 is reducible , this means that there are integer points along @xmath26 other than the endpoints . in terms of the pre - parallelogram analysis",
    ", there will be @xmath107 integer starting points @xmath78 for each intersection point @xmath28 along @xmath25 .",
    "the intersection point @xmath28 therefore has intersection number @xmath108 and the rerouting at @xmath28 will appear with multiplicity @xmath107 .",
    "these issues were briefly touched upon at the end of the penultimate section of @xcite .",
    "a final point that emerges from this discussion is that , as we observed in @xcite , obviously any rerouting must pass through one of the integer points inside the parallelogram generated by @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( namely the appropriate endpoint @xmath86 ) .",
    "we have presented a new perspective on intersections and reroutings which holds promise of further progress on the following outstanding and interrelated issues :    * the quantum intersection numbers which naturally appear in the two quantisations and have a different appearance , and in particular they are symmetric , for the straightforward bracket , under the interchange @xmath109 .",
    "this is not the case for the refined bracket . *",
    "although there are strong arguments suggesting that , for straight paths , the refined bracket and the straightforward bracket are equivalent , a full proof is still lacking . *",
    "part of the previous problem is dealing with reducible paths , i.e. paths such that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 are all integers , with @xmath106 .",
    "* we would like to extend the refined bracket beyond straight paths on the left to a more general class of paths , and ultimately get a definition of the refined bracket which closes on the class of paths . *",
    "the antisymmetry of the refined bracket for two straight paths is not manifest .",
    "* we must prove the jacobi identity for the refined bracket extended to a wider class of paths .",
    "in particular , the tools are now ready to start analysing the refined bracket when the paths on the l.h.s .",
    "are no longer straight . in the first instance",
    "we hope to address a phenomenon that occurred when we performed direct calculations to see how the refined bracket might extend to non - straight paths : we encountered some unexpected extra phases when the second path @xmath26 in the rerouting @xmath76 was non - straight , and the first path @xmath25 was straight .",
    "these difficulties did not occur when the first path was non - straight and the second straight , i.e. the discrepancy was clearly related to the fact that the middle part of the rerouting was non - straight .    in future work",
    "we also hope to explore in more detail the link with @xmath37-dimensional holonomy @xcite , as discussed at the end of section 2 , and gain further understanding of the elegant quantum geometry that emerges through the quantised goldman bracket , relating it e.g. to noncommutative geometry @xcite or to other quantisations of the goldman bracket @xcite .",
