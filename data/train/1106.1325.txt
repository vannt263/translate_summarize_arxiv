    "scientists face a rapidly growing deluge of data , which requires highly sophisticated methodologies for analysis and compression . simultaneously , the complexity of the data is increasing , evidenced in particular by the observation that data becomes increasingly high - dimensional .",
    "one of the most prominent features of data are singularities which is justified , for instance , by the observation from computer visionists that the human eye is most sensitive to smooth geometric areas divided by sharp edges .",
    "intriguingly , already the step from univariate to multivariate data causes a significant change in the behavior of singularities . whereas one - dimensional ( 1d ) functions can only exhibit point singularities , singularities of two - dimensional ( 2d ) functions",
    "can already be of both point as well as curvilinear type .",
    "thus , in contrast to _ isotropic _ features  point singularities  , suddenly _ anisotropic _ features ",
    "curvilinear singularities  are possible . and , in fact , multivariate functions are typically governed by _",
    "anisotropic phenomena_. think , for instance , of edges in digital images or evolving shock fronts in solutions of transport - dominated equations .",
    "these two exemplary situations also show that such phenomena occur even for both explicitly as well as implicitly given data .",
    "one major goal both for the purpose of compression as well as for an efficient analysis is the introduction of representation systems for ` good ' approximation of anisotropic phenomena , more precisely , of multivariate functions governed by anisotropic features .",
    "this raises the following fundamental questions :    1 .   what is a suitable model for functions governed by anisotropic features ?",
    "2 .   how do we measure ` good ' approximation and what is a benchmark for optimality ?",
    "3 .   is the step from 1d to 2d already the crucial step or how does this framework scale with increasing dimension ?",
    "which representation system behaves optimally ?",
    "let us now first debate these questions on a higher and more intuitive level , and later on delve into the precise mathematical formalism .",
    "each model design has to face the trade - off between closeness to the true situation versus sufficient simplicity to enable analysis of the model .",
    "the suggestion of a suitable model for functions governed by anisotropic features in @xcite solved this problem in the following way .",
    "as a model for an image , it first of all requires the @xmath2 functions serving as a model to be supported on the unit square @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "these functions shall then consist of the minimal number of smooth parts , namely two . to avoid artificial problems with a discontinuity ending at the boundary of @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] , the boundary curve of one of the smooth parts is entirely contained in @xmath4 .",
    "it now remains to decide upon the regularity of the smooth parts of the model functions and of the boundary curve , which were chosen to both be @xmath5 .",
    "thus , concluding , a possible suitable model for functions governed by anisotropic features are 2d functions which are supported on @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath5 apart from a closed @xmath5 discontinuity curve ; these are typically referred to as _ cartoon - like images _ ( cf .",
    "chapter @xcite ) .",
    "this provides an answer to ( p1 ) .",
    "extensions of this 2d model to piecewise smooth curves were then suggested in @xcite , and extensions to 3d as well as to different types of regularity were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the quality of the performance of a representation system with respect to cartoon - like images is typically measured by taking a non - linear approximation viewpoint .",
    "more precisely , given a cartoon - like image and a representation system which forms an orthonormal basis , the chosen measure is the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0 error of the best @xmath1-term ( non - linear ) approximation in the number of terms @xmath1 .",
    "this intuitively measures how fast the @xmath6 norm of the tail of the expansion decays as more and more terms are used for the approximation .",
    "a slight subtlety has to be observed if the representation system does not form an orthonormal basis , but a frame . in this case ,",
    "the @xmath1-term approximation using the @xmath1 largest coefficients is considered which , in case of an orthonormal basis , is the same as the best @xmath1-term approximation , but not in general .",
    "the term ` optimally sparse approximation ' is then awarded to those representation systems which deliver the fastest possible decay rate in @xmath1 for all cartoon - like images , where we consider log - factors as negligible , thereby providing an answer to ( p2 ) .",
    "we already identified the step from 1d to 2d as crucial for the appearance of anisotropic features at all .",
    "hence one might ask : is is sufficient to consider only the 2d situation , and higher dimensions can be treated similarly ? or : does each dimension causes its own problems ? to answer these questions ,",
    "let us consider the step from 2d to 3d which shows a curious phenomenon .",
    "a 3d function can exhibit point (= 0d ) , curvilinear (= 1d ) , and surface (= 2d ) singularities .",
    "thus , suddenly anisotropic features appear in two different dimensions : as one - dimensional and as two - dimensional features .",
    "hence , the 3d situation has to be analyzed with particular care .",
    "it is not at all clear whether two different representation systems are required for optimally approximating both types of anisotropic features simultaneously , or whether one system will suffice .",
    "this shows that the step from 2d to 3d can justifiably be also coined ` crucial ' .",
    "once it is known how to handle anisotropic features of different dimensions , the step from 3d to 4d can be dealt with in a similar way as also the extension to even higher dimensions .",
    "thus , answering ( p3 ) , we conclude that the two crucial dimensions are 2d and 3d with higher dimensional situations deriving from the analysis of those .      within the framework we just briefly outlined",
    ", it can be shown that wavelets do not provide optimally sparse approximations of cartoon - like images .",
    "this initiated a flurry of activity within the applied harmonic analysis community with the aim to develop so - called _ directional _ representation systems which satisfy this benchmark , certainly besides other desirable properties depending in the application at hand . in 2004 ,",
    "cands and donoho were the first to introduce with the tight curvelet frames a directional representation system which provides provably optimally sparse approximations of cartoon - like images in the sense we discussed .",
    "one year later , contourlets were introduced by do and vetterli @xcite , which similarly derived an optimal approximation rate .",
    "the first analysis of the performance of ( band - limited ) shearlet frames was undertaken by guo and labate in @xcite , who proved that these shearlets also do satisfy this benchmark . in the situation of (",
    "band - limited ) shearlets the analysis was then driven even further , and very recently guo and labate proved a similar result for 3d cartoon - like images which in this case are defined as a function which is @xmath5 apart from a @xmath5 discontinuity surface , i.e. , focusing on only one of the types of anisotropic features we are facing in 3d .",
    "the results mentioned in the previous subsection only concerned band - limited systems . even in the contourlet case , although compactly supported contourlets seem to be included , the proof for optimal sparsity only works for band - limited generators due to the requirement of infinite directional vanishing moments .",
    "however , for various applications compactly supported generators are inevitable , wherefore already in the wavelet case the introduction of compactly supported wavelets was a major advance .",
    "prominent examples of such applications are imaging sciences , when an image might need to be denoised while avoiding a smoothing of the edges , or in the theory of partial differential equations as a generating system for a trial space in order to ensure fast computational realizations .",
    "so far , shearlets are the only system , for which a theory for compactly supported generators has been developed and compactly supported shearlet frames have been constructed @xcite , see also the survey paper @xcite .",
    "it should though be mentioned that these frames are somehow close to being tight , but at this point it is not clear whether also compactly supported _ tight _ shearlet frames can be constructed .",
    "interestingly , it was proved in @xcite that this class of shearlet frames also delivers optimally sparse approximations of the 2d cartoon - like image model class with a very different proof than @xcite now adapted to the particular nature of compactly supported generators .",
    "and with @xcite the 3d situation is now also fully understood , even taking the two different types of anisotropic features  curvilinear and surface singularities  into account .      in sect .",
    "[ sec : cartoon - images ] , we introduce the 2d and 3d cartoon - like image model class .",
    "optimality of sparse approximations of this class are then discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : linear - non - linear ] .",
    "[ sec : pyram - adapt - shearl ] is concerned with the introduction of 3d shearlet systems with both band - limited and compactly supported generators , which are shown to provide optimally sparse approximations within this class in the final sect .  [ sec : optim - sparse - appr ] .",
    "we start by making the in the introduction of this chapter already intuitively derived definition of cartoon - like images mathematically precise .",
    "we start with the most basic definition of this class which was also historically first stated in @xcite .",
    "we allow ourselves to state this together with its 3d version from @xcite by remarking that @xmath7 could be either @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",

    ", we assume that @xmath19 is a closed @xmath5-curve with curvature bounded by @xmath20 , and , for @xmath9 , the discontinuity @xmath19 shall be a closed @xmath5-surface with principal curvatures bounded by @xmath20 .",
    "an indiscriminately chosen cartoon - like function @xmath21 , where the discontinuity surface @xmath22 is a deformed sphere in @xmath23 , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] .     with @xmath24 for dimension @xmath9 , where the discontinuity surface @xmath22 is a deformed sphere .",
    "]    since ` objects ' in images often have sharp corners , in @xcite for 2d and in @xcite for 3d also less regular images were allowed , where @xmath22 is only assumed to be _ piecewise _ @xmath5-smooth .",
    "we note that this viewpoint is also essential for being able to analyze the behavior of a system with respect to the two different types of anisotropic features appearing in 3d ; see the discussion in subsection [ subsec:3d ] . letting @xmath25 denote the number of @xmath5 pieces , we speak of the extended class of _ cartoon - like images @xmath26 _ as consisting of cartoon - like images having @xmath5-smoothness apart from a piecewise @xmath5 discontinuity curve in the 2d setting and a piecewise @xmath5 discontinuity surface in the 3d setting .",
    "indeed , in the 3d setting , besides the @xmath5 discontinuity surfaces , this model exhibits curvilinear @xmath5 singularities as well as point singularities , e.g.,the cartoon - like image @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon - piecewise ] exhibits a discontinuity surface @xmath27 consisting of _ three _",
    "@xmath5-smooth surfaces with point and curvilinear singularities where these surfaces meet .     with @xmath28 , where the discontinuity surface @xmath22 is piecewise @xmath5 smooth . ]",
    "the model in @xcite goes even one step further and considers a different regularity for the smooth parts , say being in @xmath29 , and for the smooth pieces of the discontinuity , say being in @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "this very general class of cartoon - like images is then denoted by @xmath32 , with the agreement that @xmath33 for @xmath34 .    for the purpose of clarity , in the sequel we will focus on the first most basic cartoon - like model where @xmath34 , and add hints on generalizations when appropriate ( in particular , in sect .",
    "[ sec : some - extensions ] ) .",
    "after having clarified the model situation , we will now discuss which measure for the accuracy of approximation by representation systems we choose , and what optimality means in this case .",
    "let @xmath35 denote a given class of elements in a separable hilbert space @xmath36 with norm @xmath37 and @xmath38 a dictionary for @xmath36 , i.e.,@xmath39 , with indexing set @xmath40 .",
    "the dictionary @xmath41 plays the role of our representation system .",
    "later @xmath35 will be chosen to be the class of cartoon - like images and @xmath41 a shearlet frame , but for now we will assume this more general setting .",
    "we now seek to approximate each single element of @xmath35 with elements from @xmath41 by ` few ' terms of this system .",

    "letting now @xmath50 , we aim to approximate @xmath49 by only @xmath1 terms of @xmath41 , i.e. , by @xmath51 which is termed _ @xmath1-term approximation _ to @xmath49 .",
    "this approximation is typically _ non - linear _ in the sense that if @xmath52 is an @xmath1-term approximation to @xmath49 with indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 is an @xmath1-term approximation to some @xmath55 with indices @xmath56 , then @xmath57 is only an @xmath1-term approximation to @xmath58 in case @xmath59 .",
    "but certainly we would like to pick the ` best ' approximation with the accuracy of approximation measured in the hilbert space norm .",

    "but it characterizes the set of best @xmath1-term approximations to some @xmath42 precisely .",
    "even more , we have complete control of the error of best @xmath1-term approximation by @xmath74      assume now that @xmath41 constitutes a tight frame with bound @xmath75 for @xmath36 .",
    "in this situation , we still have @xmath66 but this expansion is now not unique anymore . moreover , the frame elements are not orthogonal .",
    "both conditions prohibit an analysis of the error of best @xmath1-term approximation as in the previously considered situation of an orthonormal basis . and",
    "in fact , examples can be provided to show that selecting the @xmath1 largest coefficients @xmath73 in magnitude does not always lead to the _ best _ @xmath1-term approximation , but merely to _ an _ @xmath1-term approximation . to be able to still analyze the approximation error , one typically  as will be also our choice in the sequel  chooses the @xmath1-term approximation provided by the indices @xmath72 associated with the @xmath1 largest coefficients @xmath73 in magnitude with these coefficients , i.e. , @xmath76 this selection also allows for some control of the approximation in the hilbert space norm , which we will defer to the next subsection in which we consider the more general case of arbitrary frames .",
    "let now @xmath41 form a frame for @xmath36 with frame bounds @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and let @xmath79 denote the canonical dual frame .",
    "we then consider the expansion of @xmath49 in terms of this dual frame , i.e. , @xmath80 notice that we could also consider @xmath81 let us explain , why the first form is of more interest to us in this chapter . by definition",
    ", we have @xmath82 as well as @xmath83 .",
    "since we only consider expansions of functions @xmath49 belonging to a subset @xmath35 of @xmath36 , this can , at least , potentially improve the decay rate of the coefficients so that they belong to @xmath84 for some @xmath85 .",
    "this is exactly what is understood by _",
    "sparse approximation _ ( also called _ compressible approximations _ in the context of inverse problems ) .",
    "we hence aim to analyze shearlets with respect to this behavior , i.e. , the decay rate of shearlet coefficients .",

    "we remark that in case of a tight frame , there is no distinction necessary , since then @xmath86 for all @xmath87 .    as in the tight frame case , it is not possible to derive a usable , explicit form for the best @xmath1-term approximation .",
    "we therefore again crudely approximate the best @xmath1-term approximation by choosing the @xmath1-term approximation provided by the indices @xmath72 associated with the @xmath1 largest coefficients @xmath73 in magnitude with these coefficients , i.e. , @xmath88 but , surprisingly , even with this rather crude greedy selection procedure , we obtain very strong results for the approximation rate of shearlets as we will see in sect .

    ", it therefore might look as if the estimate  ( [ eq : n - term - frame - approx - bound ] ) should follow directly from the frame inequality for the canonical dual .",
    "however , since the sum in  ( [ eq : n - term - frame - approx - bound ] ) does not run over the entire index set @xmath95 , but only @xmath96 , this is not the case .",

    "this rearrangement corresponds to a bijection @xmath106 that satisfies @xmath107 strictly speaking , the rearrangement ( and hence the mapping @xmath108 ) might not be unique ; we will simply take @xmath101 to be one of these rearrangements .",
