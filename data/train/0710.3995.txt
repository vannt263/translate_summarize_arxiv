    "recent precise cosmological observations provide us with a large amount of data to probe the evolution and the present state of the universe .",
    "we now customarily extract the information from them by constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "the hubble constant , the expansion rate of the universe at present , is one of the most important cosmological parameters and measured in various ways .    in most studies which consider the constraint on the hubble constant from cosmological observations , a cosmological constant is often assumed as dark energy .",
    "however , the nature of dark energy is not understood yet , which is one of the challenging problem in cosmology today , thus the constraints on the hubble constant should also be considered assuming some possible dark energy models other than a cosmological constant . since the energy density of dark energy can change some distance measures which have been used to constrain the hubble constant , the assumption concerning dark energy is expected to have an influence on the constraint on it . in some works , the constraint on the hubble constant is obtained without assuming a cosmological constant ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) but a constant equation of state is still assumed .",
    "however , a lot of models of dark energy proposed so far have a time - varying equation of state and most of recent works of dark energy accommodate its time dependence in some way .",
    "thus , in light of these considerations and the importance of the hubble constant , it is interesting to study constraints on the hubble constant including time - evolving dark energy equations of state .",
    "this is one of the issues which we are going to investigate in this paper .",
    "on the other hand , notice that the hubble constant is often treated as a nuisance parameter over which we marginalize when we investigate dark energy since the parameters for dark energy themselves are those of interest in such a case .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that , when one studies the nature of dark energy , observations of distance measures such as the angular diameter distance which is relevant to the position of acoustic peaks in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum and the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) are often used .",
    "since the hubble constant affects such distance measures , it is expected that the prior on the hubble constant can affect constraints on the nature of dark energy .",
    "furthermore , the hubble constant can also be determined with the cosmic distance ladder measurements independently from the cosmological distance measurements mentioned above . hence investigating dark energy with some priors on the hubble constant",
    "is also an interesting subject , which is discussed in this paper too .",
    "to study the issues mentioned above , we study the constraints on the hubble constant and dark energy using the observations of cmb , bao and type ia supernovae ( sn ) .",
    "for dark energy , we assume some types of time - varying equation of state as well as the case with a constant equation of state . by assuming several priors on the hubble constant and dark energy equation of state",
    ", we can see how the determination of one of them can affect that of the other .",
    "in addition , we study them allowing a non - flat universe to make our analysis more general .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize our method for obtaining constraints from cosmological observations .",
    "some parametrizations of dark energy adopted in this paper are also briefly explained .",
    "the data used for the analysis are mentioned there too . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we present our results and discuss some implications of our results for the study of the hubble constant , dark energy and the curvature of the universe . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our results and give the conclusion . in the appendix",
    ", we give some quantitative explanations how the combinations of cmb , bao and sn can break degeneracies among the hubble constant , matter density , dark energy parameters and the curvature of the universe .",
    "in this section , we explain the method to constrain the cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant and dark energy equation of state .",
    "we use the data from cmb , bao and sn . before we describe the method in detail ,",
    "first we mention the dark energy parametrizations adopted in this paper , which accommodate the time variations of its equation of state . among various possible parametrizations of dark energy equation of state",
    ", we use simple and often used ones .",
    "the first parametrization adopted in the following analysis is @xcite : @xmath2 which varies in proportion to the scale factor @xmath3 ( normalized as @xmath4 at the present epoch ) .",
    "if we define dark energy as a fluid which can accelerate the universe , this can motivate the following prior : @xmath5 for the particular parametrization eq .",
    "( [ eq : eos ] ) , this is ensured by forcing @xmath6 and @xmath7 to satisfy @xmath8 in principle , a dark energy fluid can have its equation of state larger than @xmath9 .",
    "thus a weaker prior @xmath10 is sometimes adopted , requiring that dark energy does not dominate the universe at early time , say at the epoch of recombination , since such early domination of dark energy is apparently inconsistent with cosmological data .",
    "however this prior allows the case with @xmath11 where dark energy behaves in almost the same way as dark matter as far as the background evolution is concerned .",
    "in such a case , dark energy can be considered as a part of dark matter , which complicates the interpretation of the constraints on dark energy . with the prior eq .",
    ", the dark energy can not be a dominant component of the universe at early times and even its fraction to the total energy density is negligible .",
    "thus we can safely avoid the complication mentioned above by using the prior eq .  .",
    "we provide more detailed discussion on the effects of dark energy perturbation on the cmb power spectrum in appendix [ sec : de_pert ] .",
    "we also adopt another type of dark energy parametrization : @xmath12 where we interpolate the value of @xmath13 linearly with respect to the redshift @xmath14 from the present epoch back to some transition redshift @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath13 becomes @xmath16 at @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the case with @xmath20 corresponds to a cosmological constant .",
    "the prior eq .",
    "is satisfied by setting @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this parametrization is essentially the same as the one which has a linear dependence on the redshift @xmath14 such as @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , this form is adopted in many literatures with a cutoff at some redshift to avoid large value of @xmath13 at @xmath24 which is relevant to the cmb constraint @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we consider several values of @xmath15 to see how the dark energy parametrization affects the constraints on the hubble constant and vice versa .",
    "we note that this parametrization assumes a finite derivative of @xmath13 at the present epoch so we can not probe the dark energy model which behaves like a cosmological constant ( or a constant @xmath13 ) from some earlier epoch to the present but variable before that epoch .",
    "also , we should note that although this parametrization appears to have three parameters , we regard it as a family of two - parameter models labeled by @xmath15 .",
    "namely , we consider several two - parameter models each with a different value of @xmath15 .",
    "such a distinction among dark energy parameters may be artificial , but it is simpler and sufficient for our goal to show how priors for the hubble constant and ways of parametrizing the dark energy equation of state ( and the assumption for the curvature of the universe ) could influence a conclusion drawn from the analysis of cmb , bao and sn data .",
    "now we give detailed descriptions of the method how we make use of observational data .",
    "incidentally , the model parameter fitting to the data is performed by @xmath25 minimization .",
    "we use the brent method @xcite extended to multi - parameters , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , to search a minimum efficiently .      to fit a model to the cmb data",
    ", we first note that we here do not use the whole information of the cmb power spectrum but use only the acoustic scale @xmath26 and the matter density @xmath27 as eq .  . and @xmath28 simultaneously to obtain the constraint from cmb",
    "we in this paper use rather conventional way of using @xmath26 and @xmath27 as in , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , but both ways make use of the same features of the cmb power spectrum , the peak position and height , and should give similar result .",
    "we checked that the constraints on the @xmath29@xmath30 plane from these two methods are almost same for the case with a cosmological constant .",
    "] this is because if we include the effects of perturbation of dark energy and perform a full cmb angular power spectrum analysis to obtain the constraint from cmb , it would be very time - consuming .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to investigate cosmological constraints assuming various dark energy parametrizations .",
    "thus , in this case , much faster method is preferable and it is known that if dark energy dominates the universe only at late time , the constraint derived from the information on the background evolution well captures the nature of dark energy .",
    "this condition is satisfied by adopting the prior eq .  .",
    "the acoustic scale @xmath26 which defines the characteristic angular scale of the acoustic oscillations is written as @xmath31 @xmath26 is given once we determine the comoving angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface @xmath32 and the sound horizon at the recombination epoch @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the redshift of the epoch of recombination .",
    "the comoving angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface is given as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 for a closed universe , @xmath38 for an open universe and @xmath39 with the factor @xmath40 being removed for a flat universe .",

    "note that @xmath47 .",

    "since we consider the case where dark energy is irrelevant at the epoch of recombination , the above expression can be integrated analytically as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath27 are normalized baryon density and matter density ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) . the radiation - to - matter and baryon - to - photon ratios at the epoch of recombination , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",
    "are given as @xmath59 in fact , the redshift at the epoch of recombination slightly depends on the energy density of baryon and matter .",

    "once we give the hubble constant , matter density , baryon density and dark energy parameters , @xmath26 can be calculated . to constrain the cosmological parameters , we use the value of @xmath26 reported by wmap3 for @xmath65cdm @xmath66 in addition to @xmath26",
    ", we also use the prior for @xmath27 which is given by wmap3 for @xmath65cdm as @xmath67 notice that the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are almost unchanged even if we consider a model with a constant equation of state or a non - flat universe @xcite .    using @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we calculate the @xmath25 from cmb as @xmath70 roughly speaking , in this way , although we are not using the whole information of the cmb power spectrum but using only the information of the first peak position and height ( after we extracted @xmath55 from the second peak height to calculate @xmath26 ) , since @xmath26 and @xmath27 are determined from such different , horizontal and vertical , features of the cmb power spectra , the @xmath25 for the parameters we concern in this paper can be constructed as above .",
    "this is explicitly justified in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] for the flat @xmath65cdm model .",
    "furthermore , since the effects of the curvature of the universe and dark energy equation of state on the cmb power spectrum mainly appear as the change of @xmath26 , we can use this @xmath71 for constraints involving these parameters .",
    "we also use the baryon acoustic oscillation scale measured by sdss @xcite . to take the bao data into account",

    "however , since the effect of non - flatness or dark energy is considered to be only the geometrical one ( their effects on the perturbation do not affect the peak of the galaxy correlation function which is located at smaller scales ) , we can use @xmath80 to probe the background evolution just as we use @xmath26 of cmb if the cosmology is not radically different from a flat @xmath65cdm model .",
    "this condition is considered to be satisfied in our analysis because we place the prior eq .",

    "( namely we do not combine these two data sets . )",
    "the main difference between these two data sets is that davis07 uses the first data release of the essence supernova survey @xcite at the intermediate redshift . in detail , gold06 consists of 119 sne ( 38 sne are nearby , @xmath90 ) from the previous gold data set @xcite , 16 sne which are recently discovered by hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite and 47 sne from the first data release of the snls project @xcite .",

    "@xcite , 14 sne discovered by hst which are included in the previous gold data set and 45 nearby ( @xmath90 ) sne .",
    "thus , 30 sne which are discovered by hst and have relatively high redshifts are common in both data sets .",
    "also there are 25 nearby sne which they have in common .",
    "the snls first data release @xcite has 73 sne but gold06 and davis07 place a different criterion for the selection .",
    "we may roughly say that davis07 is constructed from gold06 by replacing sne data at the intermediate redshifts which are discovered in earlier times by the recent essence data .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to constrain the hubble constant using the cosmological observations introduced above .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , the hubble constant can be measured with other methods such as using the cosmic distance ladder measurements .",
    "we summarize the recent values obtained with the distance ladder in table  [ tab : summary_h ] . for a recent review on the hubble constant , see e.g. ref .",
    "we would like to compare such @xmath41 values measured in a relatively direct way with those obtained from the measurements of cmb , bao and sn .",
    "furthermore we also investigate constraints on dark energy putting a prior on the hubble constant to see how the determination of the hubble parameter affects the constraints on dark energy .",
    "thus we also use these values as priors when deriving constraints on dark energy parameters and/or the curvature of the universe .",
    "when we use the prior on the hubble constant , we include them by calculating the @xmath25 which is given by @xmath91 for the error @xmath92 , since we do not obtain a significant effect with those of the current measurements given in table [ tab : summary_h ] , as will be briefly discussed in the following section ( sec .  [ subsec : constraint_de ] ) , we take a hypothetical value @xmath93kms@xmath94mpc@xmath94 .",
    "this value is motivated by the expected accuracy of 1% @xcite which could be obtained through measuring maser distance to a large number of galaxies in the hubble flow by planned radio telescopes such as square kilometer array ( ska ) @xcite .",
    "we adopt a slightly more conservative value than that .",

[ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final remark is that , in the previous works @xcite , it has been shown that when we parametrize dark energy equation of state as eq .   and take @xmath96 , the region of an open universe as large as @xmath97 is allowed .",
    "however , for the result presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ok_h_margom_w0 ] , this is not the case even though we use the same type of parametrizaion .",
    "this is because we in this paper use a strong prior @xmath98 on the equation of state given in eq .",
    "but in the previous works @xcite , a weak prior @xmath10 has been adopted . as is already noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite , an open universe tends to be preferred for dark energy whose equation of state approaches to zero at earlier time .",
    "since we remove this possibility by adopting a strong prior , we do not have a large allowed region with an open universe .",
    "in other words , our result here confirmed explicitly that the dark energy whose equation of state is close to zero at earlier time , which is sometimes called early dark energy , can help to allow an open universe at least as long as the background evolution is concerned .",
    "we studied the constraints on the hubble constant from cmb , bao and sn assuming several types of dark energy parametrization .",
    "although the hubble constant and dark energy are both important issues in cosmology today , these two subjects have not been investigated much simultaneously .",
    "first we investigated the constraints in the @xmath29@xmath30 plane assuming several dark energy parametrizations .",
    "the constraints on the hubble constant from the combination of cmb , bao and sn observations obtained under the different dark energy models and priors are summarized in table  [ tab : margde ] when a flat universe is assumed and in table  [ tab : margde_ok ] when the flatness assumption is dropped respectively .",
    "it is noticed that the constraints are not affected drastically by the dark energy model assumed and/or the assumption of the flatness of the universe .",
    "it is rather more affected by the choice of the the sn data set : the gold06 set gives slightly lower value of @xmath30 than the davis07 set . we can conservatively conclude that @xmath99 and @xmath100 are highly unlikely from these cosmological observations : these parameter regions are not allowed at 2@xmath101 level for any dark energy parametrization even if we do not restrict ourselves to a flat universe",
    ". since the distance ladder estimations of @xmath41 have somewhat large systematic errors at present , we are not at the stage of arguing any possible discrepancies among these measurements now .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning in passing that the sandage s central value @xmath102 @xcite and the macri s value @xmath103 @xcite are fairly close to the limit we have obtained here .",
    "we have also investigated the constraints on some dark energy parameters assuming several priors on the hubble constant .",
    "the constraints are derived with and without the assumption of the flatness of the universe . using the present cosmological observations assuming no hubble prior",
    ", we have found that a cosmological constant and a flat universe can fit all the data satisfactorily .",
    "when we impose a prior on the hubble constant , we have adopted gaussian priors @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the central values are those of freedman s @xcite and sandage s @xcite but the error are taken to be a hypothetical value to give a meaningful effect on the dark energy parameter estimation .",
    "we have found that , even with some limited options discussed in this paper for the assumptions with respect to the prior on the hubble constant , a parametrization of the dark energy equation of state , the curvature of the universe , they can have a great influence on determining the nature of dark energy .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the choice of the sn data set affects the allowed region .",
    "we demonstrate these points by taking a cosmological constant as a reference dark energy model because it is the simplest and most conventional model which can fit the observational data sets .",
    "for example , when we adopt the parametrization eq .   in a flat universe , the prior @xmath106 reject a cosmological constant at 2@xmath101 level for the gold06 data set , but the allowed region broadens to allow a cosmological constant if we do not adopt the flatness assumption or if we instead adopt the prior @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , if we adopt the parametrization eq .   with @xmath108 and the prior @xmath107 ,",
    "the gold06 data set is in good agreement with a cosmological constant in a flat universe , but if we drop the flatness condition and marginalize over the curvature , a cosmological constant is disfavored at 2@xmath101 level .",
    "these examples imply that our understanding of the nature of dark energy can be varied by the assumptions on the hubble constant , a parametrization of dark energy equation of state and the curvature of the universe .",
    "finally , we have investigated the constraints on the curvature of the universe assuming several types of dark energy and the priors on the hubble constant .",
    "in contrast to the constraints on the hubble constant , we see the result depends on the dark energy parametrization we adopt .",
    "for the cases with a cosmological constant and a constant equation of state , the allowed region occupies larger area in a closed universe , whereas for the case with a time - varying equation of state parametrized as eq .   with @xmath108 , the allowed region extends into a region of an open universe .",
    "since there is an obvious positive correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath109 , the prior @xmath106 exaggerates the preference for a closed universe and the prior @xmath107 for an open universe .",
    "this is what we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : ok_h_margom_w0 ] .",
    "we also reconfirmed that the preference of an open universe is caused by the equation of state for dark energy which is close to @xmath110 at earlier time .",
    "this is because , we have found that @xmath109 as large as 0.2 is allowed in our previous papers refs .",
    "@xcite under the weak prior @xmath10 , whereas @xmath109 is found to be well below 0.1 in this paper under the stronger prior @xmath98 .",
    "since dark energy is one of the most important problems in science today , a large number of works are focusing on dark energy itself .",
    "however , when one tries to probe the nature of dark energy , other cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant , which was discussed in this paper , should necessarily be involved in various manners . in light of precise measurements of cosmology that we are having now , the works from this kind of viewpoint",
    "should be done to check our understanding of cosmology and may also give insights to probe the present state and the evolution of the universe .",

    "in the analysis for the constraints , we make use of the quantities which can be thoroughly determined by the background evolution .",

    "when dark energy becomes dominant component at late time , the effect of fluctuation is not significant except on large scales and that from the modification to the background is enough to extract the cosmological constraints .",

    "this shift is caused by the the change of the angular diameter distance to last scattering surface due to the modification to the background evolution .",
    "however , when we take @xmath120 in which energy density of dark energy is not negligible compared to that of matter at earlier time , the structure of acoustic peaks is significantly modified because fluctuation of dark energy can affect it in addition to the shift of the peaks in this case .",

    "in other words , the effect of fluctuation of dark energy can be neglected when energy density of dark energy is small enough at earlier time .",
    "in such a case , since the information on the background evolution alone well captures the effect of dark energy , we can constrain dark energy parameters by only studying the shift of acoustic peaks . thus , our method to obtain constraints from observations of cmb is justified when the equation of state is in a range where the energy density of dark energy is negligible at earlier time . the prior",

    "we also argued that this is equivalent to the determination of @xmath29 from the acoustic scales , @xmath26 and @xmath80 , and the luminosity distance @xmath88 since @xmath129 is given by the height of the cmb acoustic peak .",
    "thus , in this appendix , we explain how these three types of cosmological data sets can determine @xmath29 without referring to any particular dark energy model and without assuming the flat universe .      in this section ,",
    "we focus on sn and cmb observations .",
    "we start with defining @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes the highest redshift to which sn data can probe . for the present data ,",
    "we take @xmath132 . using this integral , the comoving angular distance to the last scattering surface eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_theta ] ) is given by @xmath133 in the second line , we analytically performed the integration by approximating the universe to be matter - dominated for @xmath134 and neglected the term proportional to @xmath135 since @xmath136 .",
    "now , if @xmath137 is known from sn observation , since cmb observation gives @xmath27 and @xmath138 , we obtain the degeneracy relation between @xmath29 and @xmath109 .",
    "this is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : om_isn ] as a contour of @xmath139gpc ( this is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_a ] ) and @xmath140mpc , which is in turn from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sound_horizon ] ) using @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) in the @xmath29@xmath143 plane for several values of @xmath109 .",
    "specifically , if we impose a flat universe prior , @xmath144 , @xmath29 is determined uniquely . in ref .",
    "@xcite , essentially the same argument is used to investigate the prospect of measuring @xmath109 very precisely .",
    "the next issue is how tightly @xmath143 is constrained by the data .",
    "the sn data such as gold06 or davis07 used in this paper consist of the @xmath14@xmath145 relation with an error on @xmath145 where @xmath145 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) .",
    "the integral @xmath143 is directly obtained from @xmath146 if @xmath41 and @xmath87 are known .",
    "however , the uncertainties in them can not be resolved by sn data alone .",
    "thus to cancel these uncertainties , we use @xmath145 at another redshift @xmath147 which is close to zero .",
    "( @xmath148 is required not to make @xmath149 dependent on cosmology .",
    "notice that , as we will adopt below , approximately we can use the relation @xmath150 for small @xmath14 . ) to cancel the constants , we take a difference of @xmath151 as @xmath152 since @xmath153 and , @xmath154 for @xmath148 , we obtain @xmath155    we derive @xmath146 and @xmath149 by fitting the sn data to a power - law function @xmath156 . for the gold06 set , @xmath157 and for the davis07 set , @xmath158 note that it does not refer to a specific parametrization for dark energy .",
    "the @xmath25 s are 158.9 for the gold06 data and 199.0 for the davis07 data which are comparable to the values by the usual approach @xcite of assuming some dark energy models .",
    "@xmath143 has an uncertainty as regards the value of @xmath147 .",
    "however , a numerical experiment reveals that @xmath143 barely depends on the value of @xmath147 for @xmath159 ( @xmath160 is the lowest redshift for the sn data we here use ) .",
    "thus , we take @xmath161 hereafter . then in a flat universe , @xmath162 respectively for gold06 and davis07 .",
    "notice that they do not depend much on the curvature .",
    "in fact , they change less than 1% for @xmath163 .",
    "these values are plotted as horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : om_isn ] .",
    "they cross the contour which satisfies the cmb observation for a flat universe ( denoted by the black thick solid line ) at around @xmath164 .",
    "this is consistent with the full analysis result as presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : constraint_h ] .",
    "moreover , we can see from the figure that since @xmath165 ( which in turn comes from the difference in the power - law slope @xmath166 ) , gold06 favors larger @xmath29 than davis07 does .",
    "this is another point which we have noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : constraint_h ] .",
    "we believe that these explanations are independent of the dark energy model we adopt because we use the sn data without referring to dark energy .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : om_isn ] also shows that if we abandon the flatness assumption and shift @xmath109 from zero , different value of @xmath29 is favored .",
    "this is why we can not constrain @xmath29 much from cmb+sn when we marginalize over @xmath109 .",
    "the bao data gives @xmath167 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dv ] ) where @xmath168 .",
    "this is written as @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a function which expresses the evolution of the dark energy density .",
    "here , the dark energy dependence enters in two places , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "since @xmath173 is relatively small , we may neglect the dark energy evolution ( namely , we approximate dark energy as a cosmological constant ) to approximate as @xmath174 . for @xmath175 , since this is written as @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the integral similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : isn ] ) with @xmath131 replaced by @xmath178 , it can be calculated without referring to a dark energy model provided that we combine with the sn data .",
    "this is because we can infer @xmath177 by using the fit to the sn data in the same manner to derive @xmath143 in appendix [ sec : omok_sncmb ] .",
    "similarly to @xmath143 , @xmath177 depends slightly on the sn data ( but not on @xmath147 or the curvature ) .",
    "gold06 and davis07 give respectively @xmath179",
    "now , if we fix @xmath27 using the cmb value , we have a relation between @xmath29 and @xmath109 determined from sn and bao data for a measured @xmath80 .",
    "thus , here and in appendix [ sec : omok_sncmb ] , we have replaced the dark energy dependent part of cmb and bao observables ( @xmath138 and @xmath80 ) by the empirical values ( @xmath143 and @xmath177 ) inferred from the sn data .",
    "namely , we can now draw contours of @xmath138 and @xmath80 in the @xmath29@xmath109 plane without referring to any dark energy model . in fig",
    "[ fig : ok_om ] , we draw the contours @xmath180gpc ( see appendix [ sec : omok_sncmb ] ) by the black solid line and @xmath181mpc ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : method_bao ] ) by the black dotted line .",
    "we have fixed @xmath27 to the cmb value of 0.1277 .",
    "since the two sn data sets give slightly different values of @xmath143 and @xmath177 as mentioned above , we show the results in two panels separately ( the gold06 data are used in the left panel and the davis07 data in the right panel ) .",
    "the @xmath138 contours run in somewhat diagonal direction , showing the degeneracy between @xmath29 and @xmath109 for the cmb+sn combination as mentioned in appendix [ sec : omok_sncmb ] .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath80 contours run almost horizontally , showing that the bao+sn combination is insensitive to @xmath109 and can determine @xmath29 regardless of the assumption on the curvature of the universe .",
    "this is reasonable because bao measures the distance to relatively low redshift ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "@xcite has derived a linearized relation from bao measurement : @xmath183 ( eq .",
    "( 6 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is quite similar to our slope for the @xmath80 contours . but also note that this relation has been derived only for a cosmological constant . if we consider the case with a constant equation of state or a time - varying equation of state , @xmath29 can not be determined from bao alone .",
    "our point is that when bao and sn are combined , @xmath29 can be determined regardless of the assumption on the curvature of the universe and dark energy model .    in order to check the validity of these approximations",
    ", we plot the allowed regions by the full analysis such as explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : method ] .",
    "the @xmath138 contours are compared with the analysis using @xmath25 constructed from @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the sn data set .",
    "the @xmath80 contours are compared with the one using @xmath25 from @xmath80 , @xmath27 and sn .",
    "for completeness , we also performed the all - combined analysis using @xmath26 , @xmath80 , @xmath27 and sn , which can be compared with the analyses of @xmath29 and @xmath109 done in sec .",
    "[ subsec : constraint_h ] and sec .",
    "[ subsec : constraint_ok ] . the @xmath25 s",
    "are minimized over @xmath30 and dark energy parameters .",
    "we analyzed several dark energy models parametrized as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eos ] ) and ( [ eq : eos2 ] ) but the results do not show much difference . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ok_om ] , we show 2@xmath101 allowed regions for the cases with eq .",
    "( [ eq : eos ] ) ( blue dot - dashed lines ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eos2 ] ) with @xmath108 ( red dashed lines ) as examples .",
    "note that the allowed regions for two models look alike .",
    "we can also see that the regions basically extend in the directions of the approximate @xmath138 and @xmath80 contours .",
    "therefore , it is considered to be appropriate to drop the dark energy dependence by using the sn data as we have done here .",
