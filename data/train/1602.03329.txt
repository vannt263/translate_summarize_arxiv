    "the fact that our universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion has been confirmed by many observations since last fifteen years @xcite . in standard cosmology , this accelerated expansion can be explained by dark energy(de ) .",
    "it is an exotic entity with negative pressure .",
    "one of the most simple contender for de is the time - independent cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) whose equation of state ( eos ) @xmath1 is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "but this suffer from well known coincidence problem - why de and dark matter ( dm ) energy densities are of same order at present even though they evolve at a highly different red - shift @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant problem can also be alleviated by modelling de with a scalar field whose equation of state varies dynamically .",
    "scalar fields play a crucial role in cosmology because they are simple and able to generate meaningful dynamics .",
    "canonical scalar fields can be used to model dark energy and inflation@xcite .",
    "dynamical scalar field models such as quintessence ( @xmath3)@xcite , k - essence @xcite , phantom fields @xmath4 @xcite etc were proposed as possible candidates for de . for a review on different cosmological dark energy models see @xcite .",
    "these models have some merits over the cosmological constant problem .",
    "furthermore , these models yield observed values of @xmath1 and can mimic cosmological constant at present epoch .",
    "generally , in cosmological models where scalar fields are used to describe de , the background matter does not interact with scalar field .",
    "but there is no principle of physics by which this interaction of de and dm can be ruled out .",
    "we may get similar energy density in the dark sector if there is an interaction of de and dm .",
    "so the main motivation for taking interaction between de and dm is to alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "since the nature of de and dm is still unknown , so currently there is no specific form interaction .",
    "therefore , any interaction considered is phenomenological one , even though some may have better justification over the others .    the first interaction between scalar field and matter and its various ramifications are studied in @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of interaction of quintessence and dm is that scaling solutions can lead to late time acceleration @xcite .",
    "this can not be obtained without considering interaction .",
    "furthermore , attempts have been made to study the dynamics of interacting phantom fields and dm@xcite .",
    "the recent accelerated expansion of the universe can also be explained by theories of extra dimensions .",
    "braneworld scenario is an important theory of extra dimension inspired by string theory . in this set up ,",
    "our observable universe is a hyperspace ( called brane ) embedded in a higher dimensional space - time known as bulk .",
    "braneworld models correct standard cosmology in a noble way and solve many outstanding problems of cosmology .",
    "moreover , it has some important differences from standard cosmology and one can see the standard review in @xcite .",
    "dgp braneworld ( proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ) is one of the promising theory of braneworld @xcite .",
    "it consists of two branches , one of which is the self - accelerating branch which does not need any de for acceleration and the other is the normal branch which requires de to accelerate .",
    "but the former suffers from the ghost problem while the latter is free from ghost instabilities .",
    "usually phantom fluid is known to violate weak energy condition ( wec ) but in dgp ( normal branch ) model the phantom characteristic of violating wec is suppressed by brane gravity effects .",
    "another interesting feature of this brane world model is violation of strong energy condition ( sec ) and as a result this model accelerates @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the normal branch of dgp model , the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) is satisfied at both apparent and event horizon ( with some reasonable restrictions ) and as a result this model is a perfect thermodynamical system @xcite .",
    "it may be noted gslt is an inherent property of any cosmological model and it should be valid throughout the evolution . in order to have validity of gslt at event horizon for self accelerating branch some interaction between dark matter and dark",
    "de has to be considered @xcite .",
    "so interaction between dark sectors can also alleviate problems from thermodynamical point of view .",
    "furthermore , in literature different modified dgp models have been studied .",
    "one of the simplest is the ldgp model where the source of de is taken to be cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "some of the other modified dgp models include the following : @xmath5 qdgp model where source of de is a quintessence field @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 cdgp model where source of de is a chaplygin gas@xcite .",
    "@xmath7 sdgp model where source of de is a scalar field@xcite .",
    "@xmath8 hdgp model where source of de is a holographic dark energy @xcite etc .",
    "dynamical system study has been found to be very useful in cosmology @xcite .",
    "the objective of dynamical system tool is to study the asymptotic behaviour of cosmological models .",
    "stable point of the system corresponds to ultimate fate of universe .",
    "such points are also called as late - time attractors . in other words ,",
    "late time attractors give possible solution which describe our present universe irrespective of initial conditions .",
    "recently , the interacting de models from dynamical systems perspective have been extensively studied in literature @xcite .    scaling solutions",
    "play an important role in constructing models of de @xcite and are desirable in cosmic evolution . here",
    "density of the scalar fields dominate at late time only and remains sub dominant at early time .",
    "in general , gr ( general relativity ) based scalar field models of de do not admit scaling attractor unless interaction is considered between dark sectors @xcite .",

    "<S> the phase space is studied by taking two categories of potentials ( exponential and non exponential functions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of critical points are examined by taking two specific interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the first interaction gives late time accelerated scaling solution for phantom field only under exponential potential , while for second interaction we do not get any scaling solution . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that this scaling solution is also classically stable . </S>"
