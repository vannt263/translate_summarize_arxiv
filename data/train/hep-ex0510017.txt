    "@xmath0-meson is among the most sensitive probes of the media properties . due to its large width ( @xmath19  @xmath18 ) a significant fraction of @xmath0-mesons decay inside the dense ( or hot and dense ) matter present in the collision .",
    "mesons produced in collsions of heavy nuclei can have different mass and width compared to the mesons created in vacuum .",
    "comparison of @xmath0-meson yields in different channels in different collisons systems is another way to address the same question .",
    "current results can be used as a baseline for such studies .",
    "the @xmath0-meson is abundantly produced in the hi collisions , but so far its measurement was precluded by combinatorial background coming from the @xmath20-mesons . in this analysis we took the advantage of the excellent phenix trigger capability to compensate for rather limited geometrical acceptance of the detector . triggering on energetic photons enabled us for the first time in phenix to study the dominant three body decay mode @xmath21 .",
    "complemented with the two body decay mode @xmath22 results and additional mode of @xmath23 we obtained sets of measurements which can be verified for consistency by comparision with each other and with previously published data .",
    "the analysis is based on data samples of @xmath24(@xmath25 ) sample , number in brackets to @xmath4 ] triggered events passed which quality assurance control .",
    "each event satisfies the minimum biased ( @xmath27 ) requirement of at least one hit in north and south beam - beam counters .",
    "we selected events with vertex within 30  @xmath28 of the detector center and at least one energetic photon in either of the phenix central arms .",
    "the latter requirement imposed online allowed to record the event sample equavalent to @xmath29(@xmath30 ) mb collisions .",
    "first the @xmath31-mesons candidates are reconstructed using phenix calorimeter .",
    "particles with reconstructed mass within 2 standard deviations ( @xmath1 dependent ) are accepted and combined depending on the channel of study with a single @xmath32 ( br 8.5% ) , @xmath33 pair ( br 89% ) or another @xmath31 candidate for @xmath13 ( br 31% ) .",

    "we consider systematic errors related to reconstruction of neutral and charged particles , errors related to trigger efficiency determination and analysis uncertainties .",
