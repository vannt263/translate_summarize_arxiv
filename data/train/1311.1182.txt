    "in the analytic description of phase transitions in particle physics and nuclear theory , one usually relies on the effective model approach , given the complexity of the fundamental theories involved .",
    "if we consider strong interactions , the phase diagram related to chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement is a particularly interesting example , since they are within experimental reach and currently being investigated by different experiments at rhic - bnl and lhc - cern @xcite .",
    "usually , one generally adopts low - energy effective models such as the linear sigma model @xcite and the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite , which can be combined with different versions of the polyakov loop model @xcite .",
    "the standard approach , then , corresponds to the computation of a thermal effective potential from which one can extract information on the different phases and all thermodynamic quantities , so that one can build a phase diagram .    in most cases ,",
    "the computation is performed in the mean - field approximation with one - loop thermal corrections assuming homogeneous and static background fields @xcite . frequently , vacuum loop contributions are ignored , even in a theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking , where the presence of a condensate always modifies the masses , which then become medium - dependent quantities , affecting significantly the phase structure @xcite .",
    "so , the highly non - linear behavior of the effective potential for large fields is completely missed , as well as non - perturbative effects ( with the exception of the treatment within the functional renormalization group @xcite ) . those aspects can , in principle , dramatically modify the phase structure provided by a given effective model .",
    "the boundary effective theory formalism @xcite furnishes a non - perturbative method to calculate the partition function of quantum systems in thermal equilibrium in which configurations that are not strictly periodic play the main role . in such approach",
    ", one can compute the thermal one - loop effective potential for a system of massless scalar fields with quartic interaction @xcite .",
    "the calculation relies on the solution of the classical equation of motion for the field , and gaussian fluctuations around it .",
    "the result is non - perturbative and differs from the standard one - loop effective potential @xcite for field values larger than @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the temperature and @xmath2 the coupling @xcite .",
    "the natural extension would be the calculation of the effective potential in the case with spontaneous symmetry breaking . that would allow for the description of phase transitions in effective models incorporating non - linear and non - perturbative effects , as well as controlling the infrared divergences of thermal field theory in a well - defined and relatively simple way @xcite .",
    "however , to develop the method to be applied in this case , it is necessary to deal with multiple classical solutions , since more than one solution may satisfy the boundary conditions in euclidean time .",
    "as a first step towards the study of spontaneous symmetry breaking and thermal phase transitions using the boundary effective theory , in this paper we focus on the simpler case of computing the semiclassical partition function for a quartic double - well potential in quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "although apparently trivial and straightforward , the inverted potential in this case has a region of bounded motion .",
    "therefore , one also has to deal with multiple solutions and their coalescence as the temperature changes .",
    "the usual quadratic approximation may yield good results when such solutions are far away from each other in functional space , but , as we shall see later on , this is not so in the opposite scenario . among the numerous solutions , we use the framework of catastrophe theory to identify the only two relevant ones , following refs .",
    "we then compute the partition function and specific heat , obtaining the correct limits at both high and low temperatures , and a regular behavior where the usual quadratic approximation diverges .",

    "ii we review general characteristics of the semiclassical path - integral representation of the partition function and discuss the case of multiple solutions in the double well . in section",

    "in statistical mechanics , the partition function for a system in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath1 is given by the sum of a probabilistic weight , the diagonal elements of the density matrix , over a stochastic variable that labels the state of the system .",
    "this object is of fundamental importance , as it encodes all the thermodynamic information .    for a one - dimensional quantum - mechanical system consisting of a single particle",
    ", the stochastic variable can be chosen as the schrdinger - picture position operator eigenvalue . therefore ,",
    "if the dynamics is dictated by the hamiltonian operator @xmath3 , the partition function is written as ( @xmath4 ) : @xmath5    the matrix element in the previous equation can be understood as the analytic continuation of the transition amplitude @xmath6|x_0\\rangle$ ] to imaginary time , allowing for a formal expression for the diagonal elements of the density matrix in terms of path integrals @xcite .",

    "it is , then , a straightforward task to implement the semiclassical method , as was demonstrated in detail in ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact , even the @xmath47-dimensional case can be treated for central potentials @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes more intricate in the case of double - well potentials .",
    "suppose now that @xmath35 represents a double - well potential with degenerate minima located at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , e.g. like the one sketched in fig .",
    "[ figdouble ] .",
    "as we shall see , it is now necessary to deal with multiple classical solutions .    if @xmath51 or @xmath52 , the particle lies in a region of unbounded motion under the potential @xmath53 , resembling the single - well case .",
    "it is trivial to extend the arguments given in the previous section and conclude that , as before , each pair @xmath54 defines a unique solution to equation .",
    "let us now analyze what happens when @xmath55 , i.e. when the particle starts in the well of @xmath27 . once again , its energy has to be smaller than the barrier height , otherwise the particle will leave the well towards @xmath56 without ever returning to its initial position . in other words , there is a maximum allowed speed for such particles and all the solutions departing from a point in the well must always remain therein . in this region of bounded motion",

    "as fixing the initial position and the first turning point defines univocally the classical trajectory , the plot shows the number of classical solutions related with each value of the time of flight .",

    "cc + & +    to apply the semiclassical method to compute the partition function for the double - well potential we must determine which of the solutions are actual minima of the action and track them down .",
    "to do so , we use the framework of catastrophe theory @xcite , which classifies and studies how the extrema of certain functions coalesce and emerge .",
    "a brief summary of a few ingredients of catastrophe theory is presented in appendix  [ appcatastrophe ] .",
    "following appendix  [ appcatastrophe ] , new real solutions of , i.e. new extrema of the euclidean action , emerge whenever the fluctuation determinant @xmath33 vanishes .",
    "this provides a criterium to determine the location of the caustics .",
    "it is clear that , for the problem under consideration , there are only two variables controlling the pattern of action extrema , which we choose to be @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    ", can be written in terms of the chosen ones . ]",
    "therefore , we are dealing with catastrophes whose codimension is not greater than two .",
    "the only two catastrophes satisfying this condition are the fold and the cusp , both having only one essential variable or coordinate @xcite . in other words , we know that , in our case , only one eigenvalue of the fluctuation operator vanishes when a caustic is crossed .    therefore , we can focus on one direction of the functional space : the one defined by the eigenfunction whose lowest eigenvalue vanishes .",
    "if we project the action onto that direction and perform a change of variables ( see appendix [ appnormal ] ) , we will reach the so - called _ normal form _",
    "( see table [ tablenormalform ] ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the coordinate associated to the aforementioned direction in functional space and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the control parameters .",
    "the bifurcation set is then given by @xmath66 the previous equation defines a cusp in the control parameter space @xmath67 , dividing it in two parts  see fig .",
    "[ figcuspid ] . to the right of the curve",
    "the action has one minimum , to its left there are one maximum and two minima .    if the cusp is crossed at its vertex , as in arrow @xmath68 of fig .",
    "[ figcuspid ] , the original minimum becomes a maximum and two symmetric minima appear  see fig .",
    "[ figaction1 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if the crossing happens at any other point , as in arrow 2 in fig .",
    "[ figcuspid ] , the original minimum remains and two new solutions appear  a maximum and a new ( local ) minimum  see fig .",
    "[ figaction2 ] . in the former case ,",
    "one solution splits into three ; in the later , two new solutions emerge ( out of the coalescence of their complex counterparts  see next paragraph ) while the previously existing minimum is unaffected .",
    "this picture agrees with our previous statement that the number of solutions of increases by two .",
    "it is useful to think of exactly the same merging of extrema that happens in the algebraic equation ( [ normalform ] ) .",
    "being a fourth - order polynomial with real coefficients , there are always three extrema which may be either real or imaginary , depending on the values taken by the control parameters @xmath69 .",
    "then , one usually speaks of the coalescence of _ complex _ solutions ( which always come in pairs and are conjugate to each other ) and their subsequent separation along the real axis , as opposed to their plain _ creation _ out of nothing .    as one lowers the temperature , at the next catastrophe",
    "the classical trajectory with highest action is the one that gives rise to two new solutions .",
    "so , the solutions emerging after the second caustic are still maxima along the direction ( in functional space ) of the first catastrophe . on all the forthcoming catastrophes ,",
    "the same happens : new solutions originate from the one with the highest action .",
    "thus , in the multiple - solution regime , the only solutions that are actual minima of the action are those that are minima along the direction of the first catastrophe .",
    "so , to apply the semiclassical method , we just have to be concerned about at most two classical solutions .",
    "moreover , as the first catastrophe happens before the emergence of strictly periodic solutions ( in fact , these solutions appear only in the second catastrophe ) , we can guarantee that the solutions we have to keep have a single turning point .",
    "hence , there is a criterium that allows to determine which solutions of we must use when applying the semiclassical method : _ at the end we need only the single - turning - point trajectories_.",
    "the solutions of the classical equation of motion for the potential given in equation can be expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions @xcite . in particular , the solutions we are interested in , the ones with a single turning point , can be written as @xmath70 \\label{jacobicd}\\ ] ]    where we define @xmath71 .    for those trajectories , the fluctuation determinant @xmath33 defined in can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath72}{u'(q_t)}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial q_t}\\right)_{q_0}\\ ] ]    that being so , we can now use the previous equation in to obtain the semiclassical partition function .",
    "the standard semiclassical method yields a very good approximation for the density matrix before and after the first caustic .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also below ) , the method breaks down at the caustic , since , there , by construction , the determinant @xmath33 vanishes  see equation .",
    "this can be easily understood in the functional space ( see figs .",
    "[ figaction1 ] and [ figaction2 ] ) : the second derivative of the action vanishes whenever two ( or three ) solutions coalesce .",
    "therefore , any approximation that stops at the quadratic term is bound to diverge at this point .",
    "this singularity , however , is integrable ( as also noted in @xcite ) .",
    "this statement can be proved if we perform a change of variables in from @xmath37 to @xmath44 . using and",

    "therefore , the change of variables removes the singularity and this procedure , summing over the two minima of the euclidean action , should give a reasonable approximation to the partition function .",
    "however , thermodynamic quantities are obtained taking derivatives of the partition function and thus they are affected by the singularity . therefore , as we are interested in computing the specific heat , we shall take our calculation up to the fourth order in the fluctuations .",
    "notice that this is still a semiclassical expansion , for we assume that the main contribution comes from the classical solution .",
    "the calculation is depicted in appendix [ appnormal ] , where one can also promptly recognise the standard semiclassical expansion and higher , eq .",

    "if one stops at the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ action_n ] ) . nevertheless , even the full expression is not useful for practical purposes , for its calculation requires the knowledge of the eigenfunction @xmath78 and its eigenvalue @xmath79 .",

    "( [ normalform ] ) and table [ tablenormalform ] ) @xmath80 the coefficients @xmath81 are completely determined by the values of the function @xmath82 in 3 points . in the present case ,",
    "all we need are the values of the action at the 3 extrema , easily calculated from the classical trajectories ( [ jacobicd ] ) .",
    "the following plots present the results obtained for the specific heat for @xmath83  we argue in the next subsection that this value is small enough so that the effects of the catastrophe are relevant . in fig .",
    "[ figspec_cat ] we show the results for the specific heat from different approaches around the temperature where the first catastrophe takes place ( at @xmath84 ) . on the right - hand side ( higher - temperature , lower-@xmath39 ) of the plot ,",
    "the action has only 1 minimum ; on the left - hand side ( lower - temperature , higher-@xmath39 ) , the action has 2 minima .",
    "accordingly , we plot ( dotted / magenta line ) the standard semiclassical approximation around the global minimum of the action , ( dashed / blue line ) the standard semiclassical approximation around both minima of the action , considered independent and far apart from each other , and ( solid / red line ) the current approach . the former two calculations are supposed to diverge at the catastrophe due to the coalescence of the classical trajectories .",
    "our results are also to compared the classical one in fig .  [ figspec_class ] .    here , we show the corrections that should be taken into account when the standard semiclassical approximation fails , going beyond second order in the perturbation whenever this approximation yielded divergent results .",
    "on the other hand , we still rely on the assumption that the classical solution is responsible for the main contribution to the partition function ( and , consequently , to relevant thermodynamic quantities , such as the specific heat ) . in other words , we assume throughout the paper that the first term of the jwkb expansion of the partition function is a good approximation .    just as in any standard quantum mechanics calculation , one does not expect the jwkb approximation to hold when the thermal energy is close to the height of the barrier , where the potential changes quickly and the classical turning points are too close to each other .",
    "therefore , one must require here that @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the height of the barrier and @xmath87 corresponds to the thermal energy .",
    "in other words , unless @xmath88 , the jwkb approximation itself will break down before the first catastrophe sets in at @xmath89 .",
    "semiclassical approximations usually uncover important non - perturbative information about quantum systems .",
    "they are specially suited to the construction of effective theories at finite temperature , since the perturbative approach suffers from serious infrared problems and needs involved resummation techniques to provide sensible results .",
    "the boundary effective theory has proved to be very adequate to describe the thermodynamics of a thermal massless scalar theory , providing an excellent result for the pressure at leading order @xcite , as well as a consistent description of the thermal effective potential in the symmetric sector @xcite .",
    "its extension to the case where spontaneous symmetry breaking is present is , nevertheless , subtle , the main obstacle being the existence of multiple extrema of the action for sufficiently low temperatures and the associated bifurcations of classical solutions .    in this paper",
    "we have considered , as a toy model ( however not an academic one , since the double well has , of course , applications in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics ) , the analogous case in quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "we have shown how to use the tools of catastrophe theory to deal with caustics and provide finite and well - behaved results for the partition function and the specific heat . in particular , we have proved that one needs at most two relevant classical solutions in the procedure , which renders the method of practical use . as mentioned previously",

    "now , we expand the perturbation @xmath106 in terms of the eigenfunctions of the fluctuation operator , i.e. in terms of the functions @xmath107 satisfying the following equation : @xmath108y_j(\\theta ) = \\alpha_jy_j(\\theta ) \\ .\\ ] ]                  the difference between this expression and the usual saddle - point approximation is the inclusion of higher - order terms in the variable @xmath79 , the one related with the vanishing eigenvalue , while only terms up to second order in the other variables , related with the other directions in functional space .",
