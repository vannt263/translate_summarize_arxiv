    "soudan 2 is a fine - grained iron tracking calorimeter located 2100 mwe underground in soudan , minnesota , usa . the experiment has been taking data since 1989 when the detector was one quarter of its full size ; the construction was completed in 1993 .",
    "the experiment continues to take data with 90% live time .",
    "the results presented here were obtained using a 4.6 fiducial kiloton - year exposure . for previous soudan-2 results on the ratio of ratios of the atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath6_{data } }   \\over{[(\\nu_\\mu+\\bar\\nu_\\mu)/(\\nu_e+\\bar\\nu_e)]_{mc } } }",

    "detailed descriptions have been published of the design and performance of soudan-2 calorimeter modules @xcite , and of the active shield system @xcite .",
    "we analyze fully contained events ( all hits more than 20 cm from the nearest detector edge ) to determine @xmath7 using single - track and single - shower events for which the active shield registered no in - time two - layer coincident hits ( gold events ) .",
    "this sample contains mostly quasi - elastic neutrino interactions , with a background of photon and neutron interactions originating in cosmic - ray muon interactions in the rock .",
    "these rock events are mostly flagged by hits in the active shield , but some are not accompanied by shield hits and constitute a background for our neutrino sample . a correction for this background",
    "is determined using distributions of event depth in the detector . for the 4.6-kty soudan 2 exposure",

    "we wish to analyze neutrino @xmath2 distributions where the neutrino path length is calculated from the event zenith angle , radius of the earth , and the neutrino production height .",
    "we therefore make data selection designed to optimize our resolution in event angle and in energy . for the quasi - elastic events ( tracks , showers )",
    "we require the charged lepton momentum to exceed 150 mev / c if a recoil proton is measured in the event , otherwise we require event visible energy to exceed 600 mev . for multiprongs , we require the visible energy to exceed 700 mev , the vector sum of visible momenta to exceed 450 mev , and the charged - lepton momentum to exceed 250 mev .",
    "the event counts in the resulting event samples are given in table 1 .",
    "[ tab : hires ]    .soudan-2 hires event samples for the atmospheric neutrino data ( before and after the background subtraction ) and monte carlo . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we calculate our ` resolution ' as the difference between the monte carlo truth and the reconstructed final - state characteristics , thereby taking into account both the event kinematics and the instrumental resolution .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 is 20% , and the average angular resolution is 33@xmath10 for @xmath11 , and 21@xmath10 for @xmath12 charged - current events .",
    "the corresponding resolution in log@xmath13 is 0.49 and 0.43 , respectively .    in this ` high - resolution ' ( hires ) sample , the rock background is small , 57% , and the neutrino flavor is determined correctly 92% of the time .",
    "the monte carlo sample represents 25 kty of exposure .",
    "in fig . 1 we show the @xmath2 distributions for the hires sample .",
    "1a shows that the @xmath12-flavor data ( crosses ) follow the shape of the @xmath12-flavor no - oscillation monte carlo distribution ( dashed histogram ) .",
    "( the mc histogram is normalized to the @xmath12 data . ) in the @xmath11-flavor sample , shown in fig .",
    "1b , the depletion of the data vis - a - vis the no - oscillation monte carlo is obvious ( with the same mc normalization as for the @xmath12 sample ) .    to convert results of our atmospheric neutrino simulation generated under the no - oscillation hypothesis into simulated neutrino oscillation data , we apply to every mc event an @xmath2-dependent weight representing the probability of no oscillation for a given @xmath4 and sin@xmath5 valid for two - flavor neutrino oscillations .",
    "2 displays the @xmath11-flavor @xmath2 distribution ( crosses ) together with the oscillation mc for sin@xmath5 = 1 and for four values of @xmath4 .",
    "we see that the simulation exceeds the data for @xmath4 = 0.0001 ev@xmath14 and 0.001 ev@xmath14 for most of the downgoing neutrinos , while the simulation is smaller than the data for @xmath4 = 0.01 ev@xmath14 .",
    "the best agreement between data and the simulation is obtained for @xmath4 = 0.008 ev@xmath14 .    to determine the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath4 and sin@xmath5 from our data , we fit the atmospheric neutrino monte carlo distribution including the effects of neutrino oscillations to the @xmath2 distribution for our @xmath11 data corrected for the rock background , by minimizing @xmath15 . at the same time",
    "we assume that no neutrino oscillations occur in the @xmath12 flux , and include only the total @xmath12 event counts in our @xmath15 .",
    "in addition to @xmath4 and sin@xmath5 , the neutrino flux normalization factor , @xmath16 , is the third free parameter in the fit .",
    "errors in both the data and the monte carlo are taken into account when calculating @xmath15 .",
    "3 shows our @xmath15 surface as a function of @xmath4 and sin@xmath5 . a distinct minimum",

    "the soudan-2 allowed region is seen to overlap both the kamiokande and superkamiokande allowed regions @xcite .",
    "our plans for the near future are to incorporate more recent atmospheric @xmath17 fluxes in the monte carlo , and to include partially contained events in the analysis .",
