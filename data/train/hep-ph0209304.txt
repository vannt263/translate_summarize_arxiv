    "among the scalar mesons there are only two isovector resonances @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "physical properties of both mesons are , however , not well known , for example the widths and branching ratios are poorly determined .",
    "also the mass determination is problematical .",
    "the proper interpretation of the resonant states can be obtained in terms of the s - matrix poles but the data are rarely analysed in such a way .",
    "two @xmath2 thresholds at @xmath5 mev and at @xmath6 mev lie close to @xmath3",
    ". therefore a description of the @xmath3 line shape using the simple breit - wigner formula leads to a _ distortion _ of the @xmath3 mass and width ( compare , for example differences between the results given in @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite montanet",
    "indicated important differences of the @xmath4 masses and widths found in the @xmath7 annihilation by the crystal barrel collaboration @xcite and by the obelix collaboration @xcite .",
    "recently the wa102 collaboration has observed the @xmath3 production in the pp central collisions at 450 gev , however the @xmath4 resonance has not been seen @xcite .",
    "the main decay channels of the @xmath0 resonances are @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the first part of this paper the @xmath3 production and decays",
    "will be discussed using the flatt model @xcite . next we shall present the results following from the coupled channel model formulated in 1996 @xcite and further developed in @xcite",
    "two experimental collaborations have used the flatt model to analyse their data [ 2 , 3 ] .",
    "two different @xmath2 thresholds have not been distinguished . in the flatt model the effective mass distribution in the @xmath8channel ( @xmath9 )",
    "is given by    @xmath10    where c is a constant and the production amplitudes are given by @xmath11 the @xmath1 partial width is a product of the coupling constant @xmath12 and the @xmath1 momentum @xmath13 : @xmath14 . similarly above the @xmath2 threshold @xmath15 .",
    "however , below the threshold this width becomes imaginary : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes the kaon mass . near",
    "the @xmath2 threshold @xmath19 varies slowly and @xmath20 varies _",
    "rapidly_. therefore the @xmath1 distribution is _ narrowed _ on both sides of the @xmath2 threshold as compared to the breit - wigner shape characteristic for the constant width ( independent on @xmath21 ) .",
    "the second important feature of the flatt model is the existence of _ two _ complex poles of the production amplitudes @xmath22 at different energies corresponding to the same meson @xmath3 .",
    "let us derive the pole positions following from the parameter values used by the e852 group in their analysis of the reaction @xmath23 @xcite . at the beginning one",
    "has to correct the coupling constants for the finite experimental energy resolution .",
    "then the @xmath1 coupling constant reduces to the value @xmath24 from which we have found two poles at @xmath25 mev on sheet ii and @xmath26 mev on sheet iii .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with the pole positions of the crystal barrel collaboration recalculated and _ corrected _ by us : @xmath27 mev on sheet ii and @xmath28 mev on sheet iii .",
    "the energy differences are indeed quite large : @xmath29 mev ; the corresponding difference of the total widths is @xmath30 mev .",
    "mass determination from @xcite supplemented by our determination , indicated by crosses and described in the text ]    in fig .",
    "1 we show crosses with errors corresponding to our two pole determination of the real energy parts for the experiments @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one can notice that about 3@xmath31 discrepancy between the e852 value , based on the breit - wigner form , and the mean value determination by the particle data group @xcite disappears when one considers the pole value on sheet ii at 988 mev .    by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : pdg ] one can try to answer often asked question : where is located the @xmath3 , below or above the @xmath2 threshold ?",
    "the most probable answer is : the first @xmath3 pole on sheet iii is located below and the second @xmath3 pole on sheet ii is located above the @xmath32 threshold .",
    "one remark is relevant here : it would be useful to print in the review of particle physics the @xmath3 masses and its widths in the form of the complex energy values corresponding to different determinations of the t - matrix poles .",
    "such a presentation is already given for the @xmath33 and the @xmath34 [ 1 , 10 ] .",
    "the @xmath3 coupling to the @xmath2 channel is responsible for the appearance of two @xmath3 poles . if @xmath35 then @xmath36 . if , however , @xmath37 then @xmath38 and @xmath39 in these equations @xmath40 is the @xmath1 relative momentum at the @xmath2 threshold and @xmath41 denotes the @xmath2 momentum at the @xmath3 pole on sheet iii .",
    "below we present results of the simple two - channel model of @xmath0 resonances applied in @xcite to the analysis of experimental results . in this model four reactions : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are described simultaneously using the separable interactions in the form @xmath46 here @xmath47 are the real coupling constants and @xmath48 are the yamaguchi form factors inversely proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the c.m .",
    "momentum and @xmath51 are constants .",
    "the model has altogether only five independent parameters : the @xmath1 coupling constant @xmath52 , the @xmath2 coupling constant @xmath53 , the interchannel coupling @xmath54 and two range parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the t - matrix satisfies the lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation @xmath57 , where g is the propagator matrix .",
    "we fix four model parameters by choosing the @xmath3 pole of the t - matrix on sheet ii at @xmath58 mev and the @xmath4 pole on sheet iii at @xmath59 mev .",
    "the fifth model parameter is constrained by the experimental @xmath2/@xmath1 branching ratio near the @xmath2 threshold @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath62 and @xmath63 , corresponding to the branching ratio for the neutral @xmath3 decays .",
    "the branching ratio depends very strongly on the upper integration limit @xmath64 as shown in fig .",
    "the crystal barrel result @xcite @xmath65 corresponds to large value of @xmath66 mev . the upper limit of the wa102 group @xcite is lower as it is equal to @xmath67 mev since this group studied the @xmath68 decay into @xmath69 .",
    "their measured value @xmath70 agrees well with the theoretical value 0.19 shown in fig .",
    "the obelix ratio @xmath71 @xcite is also in a good agreement with the theoretical curve .",
    "decay branching ratio on the effective mass upper limit ]",
    "according to @xcite we take the @xmath4 mass equal to @xmath72 mev and its total width @xmath73 mev . then the @xmath2/@xmath1 branching ratio calculated in the limits of @xmath21 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 is equal to 0.98 .",
    "when this ratio is evaluated in the slightly larger limits between @xmath76 mev and @xmath77 mev then it decreases to @xmath78 .",
    "both numbers stay well within the experimental value @xmath79 found by the crystal barrel collaboration @xcite .",
    "thus the model provides us with the theoretical branching ratios consistent with the experimental findings for both @xmath0 mesons .",
    "there are many other predictions coming from the coupled channel model described previously .",
    "one can calculate the elastic and transition amplitudes , the effective mass distributions in two channels , positions of other t - matrix poles not initially imposed in the procedure of fixing the model parameters and the coupling constants in two channels at each pole .",
    "some of these predictions have been already published in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated rather important energy difference of the @xmath3 poles : @xmath80 mev and the width difference @xmath81 mev .",
    "these numbers are in qualitative agreement with the results found in sect .",
    "2 using the flatt model .",
    "three interesting physical quantities are related to the diagonal s - matrix elements in two channels : @xmath82 the inelasticity @xmath83 is common for both channels , what follows from the unitarity condition , however the phase shifts @xmath84 are different in both channels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the sudden rise of the @xmath1 phase shifts near the @xmath2 threshold is due to the presence of the @xmath3 pole on sheet ii .",
    "rather weak variation of the @xmath2 phase shifts near @xmath85 gev is a result of the destructive interference between two related @xmath3 poles lying on sheets ii and iii .",
    "the interference effects are also seen near @xmath86 mev where in the @xmath1 channel the @xmath4 pole interferes with the @xmath87 zero related to the second @xmath4 pole . in the @xmath2 channel ,",
    "however , the interference is constructive and the @xmath2 phase shifts rise very quickly in vicinity of @xmath88 mev .",
    "the presence of the @xmath0 resonances leads to two characteristic dips of the inelasticity coefficient @xmath83 .",
    "the present model is suitable to study the question whether a @xmath2 pair can form a bound s - wave isospin @xmath85 state .",
    "this question is relevant since the coupling between kaons in that state is negative so the forces in the isovector state are attractive . in order to answer this interesting question",
    "we have studied the evolution of the t - matrix poles in the limit of vanishing interchannel coupling constant @xmath54 . in this limit",
    "one can find that the @xmath2 resonance exists at the complex effective mass equal to @xmath89 mev .",
    "if the interchannel coupling is switched on then this resonance evolves into the @xmath4 pole and not into the @xmath3 pole .",
    "the energy of the bound state would be real and smaller than the sum of two kaon masses . since this is not a case in our model the answer about",
    "the presence of the bound @xmath2 isovector state is _",
    "we have found that the @xmath3 meson can be described in terms of two distinct poles lying near the @xmath2 threshold on sheets ii and iii .",
    "this result is a common feature of the two models , namely the flatt model , often used to describe a single @xmath0 resonance , and the coupled channel model of two @xmath0 resonances , constructed recently by us .",
    "the second model has been constrained in the @xmath3 mass range and then successfully applied at higher effective @xmath1 or @xmath2 masses where the @xmath4 resonance is present .",
