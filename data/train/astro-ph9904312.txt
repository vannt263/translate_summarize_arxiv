    "alcock & paczyski ( 1979 ) suggested the possibility of using the clustering statistics of galaxies in redshift space to constrain the global geometry in the universe .",
    "the basic idea is that , since clusters of galaxies should not be preferentially aligned along any direction relative to a fixed observer , their average shape ought to be spherically symmetric .",
    "therefore , if galaxies were following the hubble expansion of the universe , without any peculiar velocities , the average extent of clusters in radial velocity @xmath14 ( measured from redshifts ) and their angular size @xmath15 are related to the physical size of the cluster @xmath16 by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the hubble constant and the angular diameter distance at the redshift @xmath19 where the clusters are observed .",
    "the condition that clusters are spherical on average can then yield the value of @xmath20 .",
    "of course , the effect of peculiar velocities must be included in order to apply this method , since any clustering induced by gravity will generally introduce peculiar velocities ( kaiser 1987 ) that will cause a distortion of similar or greater magnitude than the differences between cosmological models .",
    "recently , the rate at which galaxies at high redshift are being identified has dramatically increased thanks to the lyman limit technique , using the fact that the reddest objects among faint galaxies will often be galaxies at the redshift where the lyman limit wavelength is between the two bands used to measure the color ( guhathakurta et al .",
    "1990 ; steidel & hamilton 1993 ; steidel et al .",
    "for example , very red objects in @xmath21 are likely to be galaxies at redshift @xmath22 .    the galaxy correlation function , @xmath23 , which measures the probability in excess of a random distribution of finding a galaxy at a real space separation vector @xmath24 from another galaxy , has been measured for the first time for the population of lyman - break galaxies ( giavalisco et al .",
    "the correlation length , defined to be the separation at which the excess probability is equal to that of a random distribution , has been estimated to be @xmath25 mpc ( for an @xmath26 universe ; the symbol @xmath27 is used here for the ratio of the density of matter in the universe to the critical density , the subscript @xmath28 indicates redshift zero ) , about half of the correlation length of galaxies at @xmath29 .",
    "the bias , defined as the ratio of the correlation function of galaxies to that of matter at a fixed separation , is estimated to be large , @xmath30 for an @xmath26 universe and smaller for universes with smaller dark matter content ( giavalisco et al .",
    "count - in - cells analysis of the lyman - break sample used in conjunction with a press - schechter mass function for the halos also indicate that these galaxies are likely to reside in rare , massive halos that existed at the time ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ; steidel et al .  1998",
    "; see also coles et al .",
    "1998 and wechsler et al .",
    "1998 for models of clustering of lyman - break galaxies ) .",
    "these rare halos are expected to be much more clustered than the underlying matter distribution as originally suggested by kaiser ( 1984 ) ( see also mo & white 1996 , for analytic models of bias as a function of the mass of halos ) .",
    "both these analysis indicate that the population of lyman - break galaxies is likely to be highly biased with respect to the underlying matter distribution .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the feasibility of using the distortion of the redshift space correlation function of this population of galaxies to measure cosmological parameters .",
    "this possibility has been suggested before by matsubara and suto ( 1996 ) who proposed using the ratio of the value of the correlation function parallel to the line of sight to its value perpendicular to the line of sight at a fixed separation as a measure of the distortion . in this paper",
    "we express the angular dependence of the cosmological redshift space distortion of the correlation function as a multipole expansion",
    ". we are also specifically interested in applying this method to the highly biased , high redshift population of lyman - break galaxies .",
    "ballinger et al .  (",
    "1996 ) have investigated the use of the full functional form of the redshift space power spectrum to separately measure the peculiar velocity effects and cosmological geometry effects .",
    "in essence this reduces to using both the quadrupolar as well as the octapolar distortion of the redshift space power spectrum to simultaneously constrain the cosmological constant as well as the parameter @xmath31 , where b is the linear theory bias . in this paper",
    "we fix the bias of the galaxy distribution by using the constraints on the matter power spectrum at redshift zero derived from observations of cluster abundances . on large scales",
    "the power spectrum of matter at any redshift is related to the power spectrum at redshift zero through the linear growth factor .",
    "we can then use the lowest order quadrupolar distortion of the power spectrum alone to constrain other cosmological parameters such as the cosmological constant .",
    "ballinger et al .  (",
    "1996 ) also estimated the errors involved in such a survey although in fourier space .",
    "we estimate the errors in estimating cosmological parameters directly from the correlation function .    on sufficiently large scales ,",
    "where density fluctuations are in the linear regime , the angular form of the redshift space correlation function depends only on two parameters : the cosmological term @xmath20 , and the bias of the galaxy population .",
    "this paper presents a general method of estimating these two parameters from the basic data of a galaxy redshift survey , and evaluates the size of the survey that is necessary to determine the two parameters ( or a combination of them , given other constraints from the galaxy distribution at the present time ) with a given accuracy .",
    "we shall analyze the sensitivity of the method to a variety of cosmological models , placing special emphasis on models that contain a cosmological constant or a new component of the energy density of the universe with negative pressure christened quintessence ( e.g. kodama & sasaki 1984 ; peebles & ratra 1988 ; caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) , given the recent evidence from the luminosity distances to type ia supernovae ( garnavich et al .  1998",
    "; perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ; reiss et al .  1998 ) suggesting an accelerating universe . as pointed out by alcock & paczyski ,",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is more sensitive to this type of component than to space curvature .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in  2 we describe the effect of geometric distortion . in ",
    "3 we introduce the method for measuring the effects of cosmological geometry and peculiar velocity effects on the redshift space correlation function . in ",
    "4 we present predictions for a variety of cosmological models , and in  5 we estimate the errors in the observational determination of the redshift space correlation function contributed by shot noise and by the finite size of the observed volume .",
    "our discussion is given in  6 .",
    "a redshift survey consists of measuring the radial velocity and angular position of every galaxy included in the sample .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the unit vector along the line of sight , which , if the survey does not extend over a very large area , can be considered constant for all galaxies . given a pair of galaxies , let @xmath3 be the difference between their radial velocities , and @xmath15 their angular separation .",
    "we define their vector separation in redshift space @xmath33 as ( see figure 1 ) @xmath34 ^ 2 ~ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the hubble constant and the angular diameter distance at the mean redshift of the survey , @xmath19 .",
    "we also define @xmath35 , for future use , as the cosine of the angle between the vector separation between two galaxies and the line of sight : @xmath36    the quantity @xmath37 contains the dependence on the cosmological model .",
    "if we could measure the correlation function of galaxies directly in real space ( measuring distances to galaxies instead of radial velocities ) , then the simple requirement that the correlation function should be isotropic would yield the value of @xmath37 .",
    "however , peculiar velocities should obviously introduce an anisotropy in the correlation function , and their effect needs to be included .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the ratio @xmath39 for various models , where @xmath40 is the value of @xmath38 for a `` fiducial '' model , here adopted to be the einstein - de sitter model , with @xmath41 in the form of pressureless matter .",
    "the symbol @xmath42 is used here for the present ratio of the density of matter in the universe to the critical density .",
    "two of the models shown in figures 2 and 3 are the open model ( with space curvature but no negative pressure components ) and the cosmological constant ( or @xmath43 ) model ( with no space curvature and a component with pressure @xmath44 ) .",
    "the third of the models shown is a quintessence or q model with no spatial curvature and a component with equation of state @xmath45 .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is much more sensitive to @xmath43 than to space curvature , and is also sensitive to the q model , with a different redshift dependence . in general",
    ", a component of the energy density in the universe with negative pressure can have any equation of state , but the case @xmath45 implies an expansion mimicking exactly that of an open universe .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 in our q model is exactly the same as in the open model .",
    "however , whereas in the open model the negative space curvature increases the angular diameter distance compared to the einstein - de sitter model , cancelling almost exactly the decrease in @xmath5 , the flat geometry of the q model results in smaller angular diameter distances , so @xmath38 is smaller than in the einstein - de sitter model due to the decrease of @xmath5 .",
    "it is useful to note at this point that in order to obtain useful constraints on cosmological models , @xmath38 must be measured to an accuracy better than @xmath46 . in order to distinguish , between a cosmological constant and a q model , @xmath38",
    "must of course be measured at several redshifts with even higher accuracy . in practice",
    ", we can expect that any constraints obtained from measuring @xmath38 should be combined with other knowledge obtained , for example , from the luminosity distances to type ia supernovae .",
    "for a given value of @xmath38 the effect of peculiar velocities on the shape of the redshift space correlation function is well described in the literature ( e.g. mcgill 1990 ; hamilton 1992;fisher 1995 ) and the redshift space correlation function , @xmath47 , is given by : @xmath48 where , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the bias parameter for the class of objects under survey and @xmath51 is the ratio of the density of matter to the critical density at redshift @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion in legendre polynomials , @xmath52 , can be expressed as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the lth order spherical bessel function .",
    "the function @xmath57 is the linear matter power spectrum at redshift z in terms of the k vector in velocity space .",
    "note that @xmath58 is proportional to the real space matter correlation function at redshift z. hence , @xmath59 is equal to the real space two point correlation function for this class of objects except for the factor of @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "we also mention here that the @xmath61 coefficient is negative implying a squashing of the contours of the correlation function along the line of sight as is expected due to the peculiar velocities from infall on large scales .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the simple model of linear , local , constant biasing of galaxies , i.e. the overdensity in the number of galaxies , @xmath62 , is given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the overdensity in matter and b the bias . for general deterministic local bias models ,",
    "this is valid in linear theory where @xmath65 ( for @xmath66 and @xmath67 is unphysical ) ( gaztaaga & baugh 1998 ) .",
    "hence , our results are likely to be valid on large scales where the correlation function is smaller than one . in reality , biasing is not easily modeled since it depends on the complex process of galaxy formation , which is poorly understood .",
    "several alternative models of galaxy biasing have been suggested , including non - local biasing mechanisms ( babul & white 1991 ; bower et al .",
    "1993 ) and stochastic biasing ( dekel & lahav 1998 ; tegmark & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "however , for stochastic ( local ) models , on large scales , the bias ( the ratio of the correlation function of galaxies to that of matter ) will be independent of scale ( scherrer and weinberg 1998 ) as in the case of a linear , local , constant biasing scheme , although the variance in the measured correlation function will be larger for such models .",
    "on the other hand , non - local models of galaxy biasing in which the efficiency of galaxy formation is modulated coherently over large scales , result in scale dependent bias . in the absence of a well motivated model for bias , we have assumed the simplest scale independent model for the bias .",
    "it is valid only on large scales and is not generally valid for non - local biasing models .",
    "we also mention that we have only taken the linear infall velocities into account in calculating the redshift space correlation function ( see equation [ eqnxi ] ) . on small scales non - linear velocity effects ( ` fingers of god ' ) will also be important ( e.g. see fisher et al .",
    "1994 for the redshift space correlation function of iras galaxies ) .      in order to test the magnitude of the geometric distortion",
    ", we calculate the anisotropy introduced in the correlation function by varying @xmath38 about its fiducial value , @xmath40 .",
    "let the product @xmath38 for any other model be given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is defined as the geometric distortion parameter . then",
    ", using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we have , @xmath70 where @xmath71 we can now express equation ( [ eqnxi ] ) in terms of the variables @xmath72 in the fiducial model : @xmath73 rewriting this as a series in @xmath74 , @xmath75 one can immediately see from the angular dependence in @xmath76 that the expansion is an infinite series in @xmath74 , with the new coefficients of the legendre polynomials , @xmath77 , being given by , @xmath78 thus , expressing the coefficients @xmath52 of a given model in terms of fiducial coordinates introduces angular distortion in the redshift space correlation function .",
    "in this section we present our results for the sensitivity of the anisotropy of the correlation function to the geometric distortion parameter , @xmath79 . we consider here a galaxy survey with a mean redshift of @xmath80 , the typical redshift of the current lyman limit galaxy surveys .",
    "our fiducial model is @xmath81 , with the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) power spectrum . on large scales the power spectrum at redshift @xmath80",
    "is related to the power spectrum at redshift zero by the linear growth factor .",
    "we adopt the cluster normalization for the power spectrum at redshift zero , obtained by requiring that the observed density of galaxy clusters with a given x - ray temperature matches the theoretical prediction .",
    "the constraint obtained in this way can be expressed in terms of the fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath82 mpc , @xmath83 , given by ( eke et al .",
    "1996 ) : @xmath84 and @xmath85    in figure 4 we plot the @xmath86 coefficients for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , for our fiducial model ( lighter lines ) and the @xmath43 model with @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( bold lines ) .",
    "the horizontal axis has been labeled both in units of velocity ( @xmath91 ) and comoving space separation @xmath92 , calculated for the fiducial model .",
    "the observed correlation function is given by the monopole term in the legendre polynomial expansion , @xmath93 . in order to match the value of the @xmath94 coefficient to unity at the observed correlation length of @xmath95 ( comoving ) for @xmath26 ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ) , which corresponds to a correlation velocity of @xmath96 , the bias required is @xmath97 . for the @xmath89 , @xmath90 model , the bias required to match the computed @xmath94 coefficient to @xmath98 at the observed correlation velocity of @xmath96 is @xmath99 . on account of the large bias in these two models ,",
    "we can rely on the linear theory that we have used for peculiar velocity distortions of the correlation function we have shown in  3 for @xmath100 , or @xmath101 .",
    "our goal is to measure the multipoles @xmath86 of the correlation function and use it to constrain the geometric distortion parameter , @xmath79 . from figure 4",
    "we see that on scales of approximately @xmath102 , the @xmath103 coefficient is a @xmath104 perturbation on the monopole term , whereas the octapolar term @xmath105 is a smaller contribution at @xmath106 for the @xmath90 model .",
    "once we fix the bias , the @xmath94 coefficients for the two models shown are similar to each other , except on very large scales . the quadrupolar coefficients for the two models on the other hand are very different .",
    "the @xmath103 coefficient for the @xmath43 model , affected by geometric distortion , is larger by a factor of 2 compared to the @xmath26 model and comes to within a factor of 2 of the monopole term on scales @xmath107 . as we mentioned in",
    " 2 , the @xmath103 coefficient is less than zero which implies a squashing of the contours of constant @xmath108 along the line of sight .",
    "thus we see that for our choice of the fiducial model , the primary effect of geometric distortion caused by a model with a positive cosmological constant is to cause a further squashing of the contours of @xmath108 .",
    "we mention here that the @xmath105 coefficient is even more sensitive to geometric distortion than the @xmath103 coefficient .",
    "its value is approximately @xmath109 times larger for the @xmath90 model as compared to the fiducial @xmath110 model .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath105 coefficient will give us additional information with which to test the bias model that we have used .",
    "it will be interesting to compare the value of the linear bias parameter parameter derived from a simultaneous measurement of the cosmological constant and the @xmath111 parameter using both the @xmath105 and @xmath103 coefficients , to the value obtained by comparison of the galaxy distribution to the matter power spectrum at redshift zero .",
    "we now show that the difference in angular distortion of the correlation function in the two models is primarily due to the change in the distortion parameter and is not strongly dependent on the choice of the power spectrum . in figure 5",
    ", we plot the coefficients @xmath77 , for the fixed cosmological model @xmath112 , but two different correlation functions .",
    "the bold lines correspond to the power spectrum of the @xmath43 model with these same parameters .",
    "the lighter lines are for the same cosmological model , but with the power spectrum of an @xmath26 cdm model as a function of @xmath113 . we see from this figure that at velocity separations @xmath114",
    ", the differences in the power spectra dominate the differences in the @xmath77 coefficients .",
    "but on smaller scales the geometric distortion effect is the most important effect .",
    "in particular the @xmath103 and @xmath105 coefficients are similar once the monopoles for both models are normalized to unity at the observed correlation length",
    ". thus the ratios of the coefficients @xmath115 and @xmath116 are only weakly dependent on the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "this shows that it should be possible to measure the geometric distortion parameter even if the power spectrum is not known accurately from independent methods .",
    "in this section we compute the accuracy in the measurement of the multipoles of the redshift space correlation function from a typical survey volume and test the feasibility of the method described above .",
    "currently , the typical observed fields have a size @xmath117 on each side .",
    "the redshift range of each field extends from @xmath118 to @xmath119 with a surface density of approximately @xmath10 lyman - break objects per square arc minute within this redshift range ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ) . in our fiducial model ( @xmath26 ) , this corresponds to a width of @xmath120 and a depth of @xmath121 .",
    "we consider for the purpose of error estimation , a wide field of view of @xmath122 .",
    "we shall later discuss the scaling of the errors with the angular size of the field of view .",
    "any detailed calculation of the errors in a survey will depend upon the precise geometry of the survey volume and the selection effects involved in the survey . here , we consider two of the sources of error , shot noise and cosmic variance .",
    "shot noise is caused by the discrete nature of the galaxies from which we measure the correlation function .",
    "cosmic variance arises due to the finite volume we use to estimate a statistical quantity .",
    "we calculate these errors for a single cylindrical survey volume with a radius of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 for @xmath26 model ) , and depth extending from @xmath118 to @xmath119 ( @xmath125 for @xmath26 model ) . at the current estimate of surface density of lyman - break galaxies of @xmath10 per square arcmin ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ) , approximately @xmath126 galaxies would be included in our survey volume .      in order to estimate the redshift space correlation function , we bin pairs of galaxies with respect to their separation velocity @xmath91 ( computed in the fiducial model ) in widths of @xmath127 . the redshift correlation function",
    "is then estimated ( denoted by subscript e ) as , @xmath128 where @xmath129 are the number of pairs with separations between @xmath91 and @xmath127 with the separation vector making an angle @xmath130 with the line - of - sight and @xmath131 is the ensemble average of a random distribution of the same quantity .",
    "there are various different estimators for the correlation function discussed in the literature that minimize the error of the estimator due to the unknown true average density of the galaxies at the redshift of the survey ( for a discussion see hamilton 1993 ) .",
    "our shot noise will be dominated by the small number of pairs of galaxies we have in each of our bins .",
    "since we are currently only interested in an estimate of this error , we have adopted the simpler estimator for the correlation function . to analyze the data from a survey one should use a more sophisticated estimator to minimize its variance .    using equation ( [ eqnrxi ] )",
    "we obtain the estimate of the @xmath77 coefficients as given below for @xmath132 @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the number of pairs with separations between @xmath135 and @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is the average number of pairs for a random distribution of galaxies in the same bin .",
    "the summation is performed over the pairs of galaxies ( denoted by subscript i ) in the bin centered at @xmath91 . in order to calculate the statistical average of the estimator",
    ", we have to perform two integrals .",
    "first , for a given number of pairs separated by @xmath91 , we average over their possible orientations .",
    "the probability that a given pair of galaxies with separation @xmath91 is oriented along @xmath138 is given by @xmath139 , where @xmath140 the @xmath141 factor in the denominator comes from normalizing @xmath142 over @xmath138 .",
    "here we have assumed that a given pair of galaxies can have any orientation with respect to the line of sight .",
    "this is clearly not true , for example for a pair of galaxies close to the edge of the survey volume . in order",
    "the circumvent this difficulty we consider a smaller volume within the total survey volume which we call the `` reduced volume '' , hereafter denoted as @xmath143 such that the edges of @xmath143 are a distance @xmath91 away from the edges of the total survey volume .",
    "we only consider pairs of galaxies such that at least one of the galaxies is within @xmath143 . for a random distribution of galaxies ,",
    "a pair chosen in this way is not biased to be aligned along a particular direction .",
    "we can see that the largest separation at which we can measure the coefficients @xmath77 is the radius of the survey for which @xmath143 goes to zero .",
    "secondly , we have to average over the distribution of the number of pairs of galaxies in each bin .",
    "calculating the averages ( denoted by brackets ) yields @xmath144 this gives us that @xmath145 .",
    "this result can also be shown to hold for the monopole term .    in a similar way to the calculation of the statistical average of the @xmath77 coefficients",
    ", we can calculate the mean square variation of @xmath77 coefficients .",
    "using equation ( [ eqnclp ] ) we have , @xmath146    the statistical average of the above equation gives the mean square variance of the @xmath77 coefficients , @xmath147 , denoted by @xmath148 , as , @xmath149    we mention here that in deriving the above equation we have assumed a poisson distribution for the number of pairs in each bin .",
    "this assumption is not strictly valid since every pair separation is not independent .",
    "hence , one may expect some underestimation in the poisson errors we have calculated but this should be small since the second term in equation ( [ clsqpoiss ] ) is proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "figure 6 shows the expected @xmath151 error for the @xmath77 coefficients due to shot noise .",
    "each successive bin is centered at @xmath91 with value @xmath152 times that of the previous bin and hence , each bin has width @xmath153 .",
    "the average number of pairs @xmath131 in the bin centered at @xmath91 and width @xmath154 for a random distribution of galaxies within the survey volume is given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the average density of galaxies within the survey volume .",
    "this is an underestimate of the number of pairs in the bin since it counts only half of the pairs of galaxies of which one of the galaxies is outside @xmath143 . at larger separations",
    "this underestimation is maximum since , in this case , a larger fraction of all the pairs in the bin have one of the galaxies outside of @xmath143 .",
    "thus our shot noise is an overestimate by a factor @xmath157 .",
    "we can see from figure @xmath158 that with shot noise alone , the @xmath77 coefficients are best measured in the velocity range @xmath159 for a survey of the size and geometry that we have assumed .",
    "the errors on the multipoles scale as @xmath160 , and so they are smaller for the @xmath94 coefficient and higher for the @xmath105 coefficient as compared to the quadrupole . for scales close to the radius of the survey",
    "the shot noise error increases rapidly since @xmath143 is now very small . for scales",
    "@xmath161 , with shot noise alone , we can measure the @xmath103 coefficient to a few percent accuracy , both for the fiducial model as well as the @xmath43 model and hence distinguish a large cosmological constant as in our model with @xmath162 to high statistical significance .",
    "the shot noise error on the @xmath105 coefficient is small for the @xmath90 model we have shown but larger for models with smaller cosmological constants .",
    "considering shot noise alone , on scales of @xmath163 , the @xmath105 coefficient can be measured if it is present at the level of a few percent of the monopole , which in turn would indicate a large energy density in the form of a cosmological constant or some form of quintessence .",
    "we also note here that the number of pairs of galaxies at a fixed separation is proportional to @xmath143 .",
    "hence for separations small compared to the radius of the survey , the shot noise error scales as the inverse of the angular size of the survey .      the cosmic variance of a survey volume results from the sparse sampling of the universe made by the small survey volume .",
    "it occurs even if the overdensity at each point within the survey volume is accurately known , and is independent of the number of observed galaxies .",
    "we estimate the cosmic variance in this section using linear theory .    a finite volume estimate ( denoted by subscript e ) of the correlation function is given by , @xmath164 in the above equation , @xmath165 is constrained to be within @xmath143 such that its boundary are a distance @xmath91 away from that of the full survey volume and @xmath166 is within the full survey volume . for every point @xmath165 within @xmath143 , the overdensities at @xmath165 and @xmath167",
    "are accurately known .",
    "the ensemble average of the estimator gives , @xmath168 where as previously , quantities without the subscript @xmath169 stand for their true values .",
    "similarly , @xmath170 the variance in @xmath171 can be computed using , @xmath172 where , @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175 , @xmath176 .    in order to simplify the above expression , we approximate the overdensities to be in the linear regime .",
    "the linear overdensities are gaussian distributed and the four point expression in the above equation can be expressed in terms of two point correlation functions : @xmath177 thus the last two terms in equation ( [ eqn4pt ] ) contribute to the root mean square variance in @xmath171 . since @xmath178 is independent of the azimuthal angle in equation ( [ eqncl ] ) , we can also integrate over this angle .",
    "therefore we can express the root mean square variance as , @xmath179    the method we employed in the calculation of the above integrals is detailed in the appendix .",
    "figure 7 displays the expected cosmic variance errors for our survey volume for the multipole coefficients .",
    "for all three coefficients , the cosmic variance dominates the error on large scales , while the shot noise contribution is larger on smaller scales .",
    "the error is smallest in the region @xmath180 , so this is the best scale at which to measure the quadrupole and octapole coefficients and hence estimate the geometric distortion factor .    as mentioned before , the cosmic variance error that we have calculated assumes linear theory and",
    "hence we have underestimated the contribution to the errors from fluctuations and non - linear velocity effects on small scales . as mentioned in  3",
    "if we adopt a local but stochastic model for the distribution of galaxy number density as a function of the underlying mass density , then the bias will still be scale independent on large scales , but there will be a larger variance in the measured correlation function . in the absence of a well motivated stochastic biasing model , we have not estimated the variance in the @xmath77 coefficients arising from such a model of the bias .",
    "depending on the true nature of bias , we may be underestimating the variance of the measured correlation function .",
    "a more precise estimate of the error can only be given by the direct analysis of numerical simulations , a project we plan to return to in a later paper .",
    "we note here that we have not assumed that the mean overdensity within the survey volume is zero .",
    "the fluctuation in the mean overdensity is the primary source of the cosmic variance error for the monopole component of the correlation function .",
    "this fluctuation of course does not affect the higher multipoles of the correlation function and hence on small scales the error on the higher multipoles is smaller than on the monopole coefficient . with the combined shot noise and cosmic variance errors the @xmath103 coefficient can be measured to a few percent accuracy both for the fiducial @xmath26 model as well as the @xmath43 models which have a larger quadrupole coefficient compared to the fiducial model .",
    "thus , with our estimate of the errors , we can distinguish a geometric distortion factor of about @xmath181 corresponding to a @xmath43 model with @xmath90 to high statistical significance . from figures 6 and 7",
    "we also see that for our survey volume , the @xmath105 coefficient can be measured to @xmath12 accuracy for the @xmath90 model .",
    "the errors are larger for models with smaller cosmological constants .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the octapolar coefficient is possible if it is present at the level of a few percent of the monopole on scales of @xmath182 as in case of a large cosmological constant .",
    "since the error on @xmath105 is large , a simultaneous measurement of both the @xmath111 parameter as well as the cosmological constant from the anisotropy of the redshift space correlation function alone is difficult .",
    "this has been indicated earlier by ballinger et al .",
    "if the the octapolar coefficient can be measured , and the bias parameter constrained , it will be interesting to compare its value to the one obtained by comparison of galaxy clustering to the assumed underlying matter distribution .",
    "but we emphasize that when we assume that the amplitude of the matter power spectrum is known , and only one parameter needs to be measured from the redshift space correlation function , then the quadrupolar geometric distortion effect of the cosmological constant can be measured to high accuracy .",
    "for scales much smaller than the radius of the survey , the cosmic variance error scales as the inverse square root of the volume of the survey and hence as the inverse of the angular size of the survey .",
    "thus both shot noise and cosmic variance have similar dependence on the angular size of the survey on small length scales . a large cosmological constant may be distinguished with high statistical significance for smaller angular size surveys depending upon other sources of error . considering only the shot noise and the cosmic variance that we have estimated , for a survey of angular size @xmath183 , with a factor of three increase in the errors",
    ", we can still measure the quadrupolar coefficient affected by a geometric distortion parameter of @xmath181 with an accuracy of approximately @xmath104 on a scale of @xmath184 .",
    "the error is larger for smaller distortion factors . since a variation of the cosmological constant from zero to @xmath185 changes the quadrupolar coefficient by a factor of 2",
    ", we can use a linear relation between the two to make an approximate estimate of the accuracy with which the value of the cosmological constant can be measured .",
    "this gives us that a large cosmological constant , for which the error in the difference of the @xmath103 coefficient with respect to its value in the fiducial model is small , can be constrained with an error bar of approximately @xmath186 with a @xmath183 field of view . since in fact",
    "this linear relation is incorrect and the geometric distortion parameter is more sensitive to a variation in the cosmological constant when it is large ( ballinger et al .",
    "1996 ) , the error we have quoted will be somewhat smaller for large @xmath187 ( @xmath13 ) . for a field of view of this size",
    ", the @xmath105 coefficient can also be measured , although with a large error of @xmath188 , if it is present at the level of a few percent of the monopole as in the case of geometric distortion with respect to the fiducial @xmath26 model by a cosmological constant @xmath90 .    for a smaller field of view",
    ", the monopole coefficients have to be measured on scales smaller than @xmath189 where shot noise is the dominant source of error .",
    "for example for a field size of @xmath190 , the quadrupole coefficient corresponding to a @xmath191 geometric distortion parameter can still be measured to an accuracy of approximately @xmath192 on a scale of @xmath102 .",
    "hence it can be distinguished from the fiducial @xmath26 model at the @xmath193 level .",
    "for smaller scales the error is larger while to measure the distortion parameter at larger scales a larger field size is required .",
    "thus a field at least @xmath190 in diameter , corresponding to an area approximately four times the currently used field size , is required to distinguish a @xmath90 model from our fiducial @xmath26 model .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the feasibility of using the high redshift population of lyman - break galaxies to measure the geometric distortion effect and hence constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the method is particularly sensitive to components of energy density with negative pressure and in particular to the cosmological constant .",
    "the principal advantage of using this population of galaxies is their high bias with respect to the underlying matter distribution .",
    "this tends to suppress the peculiar velocity effects and makes it easier to measure the geometric distortion effect . as pointed out by ballinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , a simultaneous measurement of the bias and the cosmological constant using the redshift space distortion alone is difficult except in case of a large cosmological constant . in this paper",
    "we assumed that the matter power spectrum at redshift @xmath80 is related by the linear growth factor to the matter power spectrum at redshift zero which is constrained by observations of cluster abundances .",
    "we fixed the bias of the lyman - break galaxies by comparing their clustering to the assumed matter power spectrum at redshift @xmath80 .",
    "then we only need to measure one parameter , the geometric distortion parameter , from the anisotropy of the correlation function .",
    "this permits us to use the lowest order quadrupolar distortion of the redshift space power spectrum to constrain the geometric distortion parameter to high accuracy . in cases of a large energy density in a cosmological constant or quintessence",
    ", the octapolar coefficient may also be measured .",
    "an interesting test would then be to compare the value of the bias parameter derived from the additional information provided by the octapolar term to that determined by comparing the galaxy clustering to the matter power spectrum .",
    "we estimated that in order to distinguish a flat model with @xmath90 from the einstein - de sitter case , at least a @xmath190 sized circular field of view is required .",
    "currently the observation fields have sizes of approximately @xmath194 , which are too small for measurements of geometric distortion , both due to shot noise and cosmic variance .",
    "it is preferable to measure the distortion effect on large scales where the effects of peculiar velocities can be analytically computed using linear theory . for this reason ,",
    "it is better to use a single large field of view than to combine data from several small fields of view which provide data only on smaller scales . for a more accurate measurement of the distortion parameter",
    "larger field sizes are required .",
    "we estimated that for a field size of @xmath195 , the best scale at which to measure the ratio of the quadrupole coefficient to the monopole is approximately @xmath189 , or @xmath196 in the @xmath26 model and somewhat smaller for a smaller field .",
    "since the difference in the quadrupolar coefficients for the flat @xmath197 and @xmath90 models can be measured to @xmath12 accuracy with a circular field of diameter @xmath183 , we made a rough estimate that a large cosmological constant @xmath13 can be measured with this precision .",
    "our cosmic variance was estimated using the linear correlation function and we have underestimated the error due to fluctuations and non linear velocity effects on small scales . we have also used a very simple local non - stochastic scale independent model for the bias .",
    "stochastic bias will lead to variance in the measured correlation function which we have not accounted for .",
    "a full calculation of the errors including non linear effects will require analysis of numerical simulations , which we will discuss in a future paper .",
