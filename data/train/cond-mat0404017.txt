    "our estimates of the exponent @xmath1 are incompatible for the 3-state clock model and the ashkin - teller model . both are compatible within error bars with the estimates found in the literature  : @xmath132 for the 3-state clock model  @xcite and @xmath150 for the ashkin - teller when fitting the data given by  @xcite along the critical line and assuming a dynamical exponent equal to that of the 3-state potts model  @xcite .",
    "while these models belong to the same universality class at equilibrium , it seems thus not to be anymore the case out - of - equilibrium .",
    "surprisingly , the fluctuation - dissipation ratios @xmath2 are compatible within error bars for the two models , although a small downward curvature may be observed for the ashkin - teller model .",

    "the effective exponent @xmath1 and the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath2 that we numerically obtained are plotted on figure  [ fig8 ] and our final estimates are collected in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "our estimates of @xmath1 for the 4-state potts model and the baxter - wu model are compatible within error bars but the latter are very large . on the other hand , estimates of @xmath1 for the multispin ising model and the the baxter - wu model are fully incompatible .",
    "our values are compatible , although at the boundary of error bars , with the estimates found in the literature for the 4-state potts model  @xcite  : @xmath133 assuming @xmath134 and the baxter - wu model  @xcite  : @xmath152 but not for the multispin ising model  @xcite  : @xmath153 assuming the same value for @xmath7 ( @xmath154 with @xmath155 ) . note that these values were calculated from the estimates of @xmath20 and @xmath7 obtained by short - time dynamics monte carlo simulations .",
    "the value of @xmath1 that we give is very sensitive to the accuracy of the dynamical exponent @xmath7 .",
    "note as well that we would have obtained smaller estimates of @xmath1 if we would have done shorter simulations or restricted our calculations to smaller values of @xmath34 .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath2 reproduces the same tendency as can be seen on table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the estimates for the 4-state potts model and the multispin ising model are in agreement while that of the baxter - wu model is clearly not .",
    "however , the data for both the 4-state potts model and the baxter - wu model show a downward curvature as can be seen on figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "the final estimates of @xmath2 have to be taken carefully for these models .",
    "we have addressed the question of universality for ageing ferromagnets , focusing on the study of the autocorrelation decay exponent @xmath1 and the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that , apart from @xmath2 for the ising model on triangular lattice , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not depend on the particular lattice on which the models lives .",
    "this supports the idea of an extension of equilibrium universality classes to out - of - equilibrium processes . on the other hand , the baxter - wu model and a multispin ising model , both belonging to the 4-state potts model universality class at equilibrium ,",
    "do not share the same exponent @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the 3-state potts model and the ashkin - teller model , both belonging to the same universality class at equilibrium , have different exponents @xmath1 but the same fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath2 .",
    "this raises the question of the relevant quantities sufficient to characterise the universality class .",
    "let us recall that we have not studied the influence of the dynamics itself on the universal quantities .",
    "it would be interesting for example to check whether the transition rates eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] and [ eq3b ] lead to the same exponents and fluctuation - dissipation ratios or not .",
