    "<S> we measured the optical properties of mixed valent vanadium oxide nanoscrolls and their metal exchanged derivatives in order to investigate the charge dynamics in these compounds . </S>",

    "<S> a low - energy electronic excitation associated with the pinned carriers appears in the far infrared and persists at low temperature , suggesting that the nanoscrolls are weak metals in their bulk form , dominated by inhomogeneous charge disproportionation and madelung energy effects .    </S>",

    "<S> stoichiometric considerations do not , of course , distinguish between a true mixed - valent v@xmath11 state that may be metallic and a state with an inhomogenous charge distribution , consisting of v - ions with distinct small and large charges . </S>",
    "<S> such charge disproportionation is common in oxides of ti and v with formal oxidation states of ti@xmath12 and v@xmath11 , respectively , and the convention is to assign integer charges ( ti@xmath13 and ti@xmath14 ; v@xmath14 and v@xmath15 ) to the ions with different oxidation states.@xcite we adopt the same convention here , and consider the possibility of charge disproportionation in the nanoscale vanadates .    </S>",
    "<S> the compounds we consider are actually scrolls , consisting of vanadate layers between which organic molecules are intercalated . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the size of the amine or diamine template determines scroll winding , providing an opportunity to tune the size of these materials . </S>",
    "<S> the typical scrolls are @xmath915 - 100 nm in diameter , containing up to 30 vanadium oxide layers ( inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvostruc](a ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> the data suggest a tetragonal lattice of basal repeat size 6.144  , closely related to that of bav@xmath6o@xmath7 , which has a planar structure of basal size 6.160  . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite recently , electron- and hole - doped vanadium oxide nanoscrolls were reported to be 300 k ferromagnets , raising fundamental questions about the underlying magnetic exchange mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was further suggested that charge - injection via `` doping '' introduces free carriers into the pristine mott insulating scrolls , resulting in partially filled bands . </S>",
    "<S> the `` doped '' nanoscrolls are predicted to exhibit drude - type metallic behavior within this picture . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite direct measurement of the low - energy electronic structure is clearly important to test this prediction . </S>",
    "<S> further , the rigid band model raises fundamental questions about the chemical nature of the `` doping '' or ion exchange process in the scrolled vanadates . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite from the chemical perspective , metal intercalation does not appear as simple as `` putting in electrons '' ; both reduction of vanadium as well as ion exchange with the proton on the amine are possible consequences of the exchange process . to date , only mn@xmath0 has been shown to completely replace the organic template , even though some other ions such as na@xmath18 , li@xmath18 , zn@xmath0 , cu@xmath0 , and ca@xmath0 can partially replace the amine template . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in order to understand the fundamental charge dynamics and test the applicability of the rigid band model in vanadium oxide nanoscrolls , we investigated the variable temperature optical spectra of the pristine and mn@xmath0 exchanged materials . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the rigid band model expectation for a metallic state , we find that charge is pinned in the metal substituted scrolls . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy electronic excitation associated with the pinned carriers appears in the far infrared and persists at low temperature , suggesting that the nanoscrolls are weak metals in their bulk form , dominated by inhomogeneous charge disproportionation and madelung energy effects . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an alternate model for charge injection to account for our observations . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the vibrational properties shows that the 575 @xmath19 v - o - v equatorial stretching mode is very sensitive to metal substitution , indicating that ion exchange modifies both the local curvature and charge environment . </S>",
    "<S> charge effects also shift excitations in the higher energy optical conductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> vanadate nanoscrolls were prepared by an initial sol - gel reaction followed by hydrothermal treatment , as described previously . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite appropriate amines ( c@xmath20h@xmath21nh@xmath22 with @xmath23=4 - 18 ) were employed as the structure - directing agent . </S>",
    "<S> ion exchange was preformed by stirring a mixture of vanadate nanoscrolls and mcl@xmath22 ( m = mn@xmath0 , zn@xmath0 , and na@xmath18 ) for 2 hours in ethanol / water mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic experiments were carried out over a wide energy range ( 4 mev - 6.2 ev ; 30 - 50000 @xmath19 ) using a series of spectrometers . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite variable temperature work was done between 4.2 and 300 k using an open - flow helium cryostat and temperature controller . </S>",

    "<S> the inset shows a magnified view of the low - frequency response of pristine and mn@xmath0 exchanged scrolls . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated dc conductivity is indicated by filled circles at @xmath25 = 0 in both panels.,width=3 ]    figure  [ fig_dvolowfre ] shows the optical conductivity of the pristine vo@xmath5 scrolls and the mn@xmath0 substituted compounds at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the pristine scrolls display semiconducting behavior , with clearly resolved vibrational modes below 1000 @xmath19 and a low background conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> these modes were previously assigned as v - o - v axial and equatorial stretching , v - o bending , and screw - like motion of the scrolls . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite subtle spectral changes occur when the amine template is exchanged for mn@xmath0 , zn@xmath0 , or na@xmath18 . in the mn@xmath0 substituted compound ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvolowfre ] ) , the optical conductivity develops a broad electronic background in the far infrared region , with strong phonons riding top of this excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the fano - like lineshapes of several phonons , especially those near 250 and 380 @xmath19 , indicate that the background is electronic in nature.@xcite this localized electronic excitation has a width of @xmath9400 - 500 @xmath19 . extrapolating @xmath26 to zero frequency , we find @xmath27 @xmath91 @xmath28 @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> such a pinned carrier response is characteristic of a weak or `` bad '' metal rather than a traditional drude metal and has been observed in other complex oxides.@xcite we obtain similar results at low temperature , suggesting that the vanadium centers in both pristine and ion - exchanged scrolls are charge disproportionated , with v@xmath14 and v@xmath15 centers rather than the mixed valent state ( v@xmath11 ) that might be anticipated for a highly conducting material .    based on the observation of a pinned electronic excitation in the far infrared , the ion exchange processes does add carriers to the scrolled vanadates . </S>",
    "<S> the carriers are not , however , mobile in the ion substituted scrolls . </S>",
    "<S> single scroll scanning tunneling microscope measurements are in progress to complement this spectroscopic work with local di / dv measurements </S>",

    "<S> this structure will likely have a relatively narrow bandwidth because the excitation is between split defect levels . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) alternate approach to the exchange process in which ion exchange adds carriers within the rigid band model.@xcite a metallic state might be anticipated to arise from the partially - filled band . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) schematic view in which the v @xmath32 band splits due to chemical disorder effects . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 represents a possible low energy excitation , although it might be anticipated to display a wider band width than in scheme ( c ) due to joint density of states considerations . </S>",
    "<S> , width=3 ]    we now discuss the evolution of the electronic structure of the nanoscrolls due to the metal exchange process within a heuristic correlated - electron model . </S>",
    "<S> we use an `` effective '' band picture , even though a localized description may be more suitable for charge - disproportionated v - oxides , @xcite in order to maintain continuity with the existing literature . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the pristine scrolls , depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvomodel](a ) , are semiconductors with an optical gap of @xmath90.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this gap derives from a superposition of both v on - site @xmath33 to @xmath33 excitations and v@xmath14 to v@xmath15 charge transfer excitations . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> thus charge disproportionation exists already in the pristine material . </S>",
    "<S> optical gaps with similar magnitude are observed in bulk vo@xmath22 , ladder - like @xmath34@xmath35-nav@xmath22o@xmath16 , tubular na@xmath22v@xmath3o@xmath36 , and certain molecular magnets.@xcite within the rigid band scenario , the metal exchange process merely involves charge injection into the v 3@xmath33 conduction band , which is now partially - filled ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvomodel](d)).@xcite the spectral response of the mn@xmath0-substituted nanoscrolls in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvolowfre ] , however , clearly precludes the metallic state expected from the bandfilling model . even if the partially - filled band of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvomodel](d ) is split due to chemical disorder effects ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvomodel](e ) ) , the resulting low energy excitation would be fairly broad due to joint density of states considerations in which the narrow occupied level below @xmath30 is coupled to the wider empty conduction band arising from the v @xmath32 states .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the optical response indicates that the ion exchange process injects charges that are strongly localized due to disorder and madelung energy considerations . </S>",
    "<S> any charge introduced into the system can in principle reduce a v@xmath15 to a v@xmath14 ion . </S>",
    "<S> this extra electron remains pinned , however , as mn@xmath0 ions will `` bind '' preferentially ( though not entirely ) to the oxygen atoms bonded to a v@xmath14 ion than to a v@xmath15 ion , since proximity to a v@xmath15 ion would raise the madelung energy substantially . thus even in the  ` </S>",
    "<S> doped' system there exists a barrier to electron hopping between neighboring v@xmath14 and v@xmath15 ions . within the effective band model </S>",
    "<S> therefore the charging process leads to strongly localized deep defect levels as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvomodel](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the d.c . </S>",
    "<S> conductivity may be dominated by hopping between the disordered v@xmath14 and v@xmath15 ions . </S>",
    "<S> the nonbonding character of the localized levels gives them their narrow widths . </S>",
    "<S> the local potentials of the two kinds of ions continue to be different due to electron - electron repulsions between neighboring v@xmath14-v@xmath14 ions and long - range madelung energy involving the mn@xmath0 ions . </S>",
    "<S> we have depicted this in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvomodel](c ) by an energy splitting between `` occupied '' ( predominantly v@xmath14 ) and `` unoccupied '' ( predominantly v@xmath15 ) defect levels . a dipole - allowed transition between these split defect levels would be consistent with a localized charge excitation rather than a traditional metallic response in the low energy region of the optical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> such a feature would be relatively narrow , consistent with the 400 - 500 @xmath19 linewidth observed in the spectrum of mn@xmath0 substituted scrolls . </S>",
    "<S> the above localized picture is in better accord with our experimental results for the pristine and mn@xmath0 exchanged scrolls .    </S>",
    "<S> careful examination of vibrational mode patterns can also provide information on the ion exchange process , although in this case , we must account for both charge and structural modifications . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is possible because vibrational features are observed in both the pristine and ion exchanged materials . in the pristine vanadium oxide nanoscrolls , the mode at @xmath9575 @xmath19 is assigned as the v - o - v equatorial stretch . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this mode is very sensitive to curvature , widening as the size of the amine template is reduced , characteristic of a more strained lattice . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the v - o - v equatorial stretching mode ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvolowfre ] ) redshifts with ion substitution , moving from @xmath9575 @xmath19 in the pristine scrolls , to @xmath9570 @xmath19 in na@xmath18 and @xmath9560 @xmath19 in mn@xmath0 exchanged compounds . </S>",
    "<S> similar shifts in peak position are also observed in other doped and intercalated vanadates . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite from the structural point of view , the redshifted v - o - v equitorial streching mode in the scrolled vanadates is unexpected because x - ray results indicate that the interlayer distance decreases as the smaller metal ions replace the larger amines . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the v - o - v equatorial stretching mode might therefore be expected to widen in the substituted scrolls due to their increased curvature , but the center peak position ought to be relatively insensitive to size . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ion exchange also adds charge to the scrolls . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute changes in the v - o - v equatorial stretching mode position ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvolowfre ] ) to charging effects which overcome the aforementioned local strain that tends to widen and slightly harden the v - o - v resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this overall softening trend ( @xmath9575 @xmath19 in the pristine scrolls to @xmath9560 @xmath19 in the mn@xmath0 substituted compound ) confirms that the ion exchange process adds carriers to the scrolls . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp , unscreened vibrational features in the ion substituted scrolls show , however , that the carriers are not mobile , consistent with the observation of a pinned charge excitation in the far infrared . </S>",
    "<S> the metal exchange process also leads to some chemical disorder , as evidenced in the splitting of a low frequency bending motion ( @xmath9179 @xmath19 ) and the screw - like mode of the scroll at @xmath9112 @xmath19 that is analogous to the radial breathing mode in carbon nanotubes ( inset , fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the inset shows a close - up view of the @xmath95 ev excitation , which changes modestly with sheet distance in the unsubstituted scrolls.@xcite in the inset , the curves are offset for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> , width=3 ]    figure  [ fig_dvoelectr ] displays the 300 k optical conductivity of the pristine vo@xmath5 scrolls and the mn@xmath0 exchanged compound over a broader energy range . with the exception of the aforementioned bound carrier excitation localized in the far infrared ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvolowfre ] ) , the spectrum of the ion exchanged scrolls is similar to that of the pristine compound , in line with the fact that these excitations derive from the vanadium oxide framework . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite both materials display similar @xmath90.5 ev optical gaps and excitations centered near 1 ev that derive from a superposition of v @xmath33 to @xmath33 on - site excitations and v@xmath14 to v@xmath15 charge transfer excitations.@xcite the o @xmath37 to v @xmath33 charge transfer excitations at @xmath93.9 and @xmath95.0 ev redshift with ion substitution . that this is a charge ( rather than size ) effect is evident from a comparison of the data in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dvoelectr ] . here , the excitation centered at @xmath95.0 ev , which is probably polarized in the radial direction , shifts to higher energy as the size of the amine template decreases ( corresponding to a reduction in the interlayer distance).@xcite the 3.9 ev feature does not change with curvature . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the mn@xmath0 substituted scrolls display the opposite trend , indicating that charge effects also modify the charge transfer excitations . </S>",
    "<S> first principles electronic calculations will offer microscopic insight on this problem .    we measured the optical spectra of pristine and mn@xmath0 substituted vanadium oxide nanoscrolls in order to understand the charge dynamics in the pristine and metal exchanged materials and to test the applicability of the rigid band model . </S>",

    "<S> our model is consistent with inhomogeneous charge disproportionation ( v@xmath14 and v@xmath15 ) in both the pristine and the ion - exchanged materials , and explains the observed far infrared charge localization . </S>",
