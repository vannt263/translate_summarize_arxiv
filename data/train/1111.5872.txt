    "the _ median _",
    "problem is of particular interest : while the distance problem is tractable in many models , the median problem is its simplest natural extension ( a distance is a function of two genomes , while the median score is a function of three genomes ) and is computationally intractable in most models .",
    "computing median is at the heart of inferring gene order phylogenies and ancestral gene orders  @xcite .",
    "this motivated research on tractability issues of genomic median problems , well summarized in the recent paper  @xcite , as well as on practical algorithms to address it ( see  @xcite and references there ) .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the median problem is as follows : given three genomes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and a genomic distance model @xmath4 , find a genome @xmath5 that minimizes the _ cost _ of @xmath4 over @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 .",
    "it is in fact an ancestral genome reconstruction problem , as @xmath5 can be seen as the last - common ancestor of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 acting as _ outgroup _ ( i.e. a genome whose last common ancestor with @xmath1 and @xmath2 is an ancestor of @xmath5 ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "tannier _ et al .",
    "_ explored several variants , based on different models of genomes ( linear , circular or mixed , see section  [ sec : prelim ] ) and of genomic distances ( breakpoint , double - cut - and - join , reversals ,  ) .",
    "in particular , they showed that if @xmath4 is the double - cut - and - join ( dcj ) distance , which is currently the most widely used genomic distance , then computing a circular or mixed median is np - complete . in fact , the only known tractable median problem is the mixed breakpoint median : @xmath4 is the breakpoint distance and the median can contain both linear and circular chromosomes . from a combinatorial point of view , the central object in the dcj model is the _ breakpoint graph _ : the dcj distance between two genomes with @xmath8 genes is indeed easily obtained from the number of cycles and paths containing odd number of vertices ( odd paths ) in this graph  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in understanding properties of this graph , and especially of the family of _ adequat subgraphs _ , lead xu to introduce algorithms to compute dcj median genomes which are efficient on real data , but do not define well characterized classes of tractable instances  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we show the following result : if the breakpoint graph of three genomes contains a constant number of vertices of degree 3 , then computing a dcj circular median is tractable . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first result defining an explicit non - trivial class of tractable instances related to the dcj median problem . in section  [ sec :",
