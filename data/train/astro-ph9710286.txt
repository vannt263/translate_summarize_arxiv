    "within the local group the most numerous type of galaxy are the dwarf elliptical ( de ) systems : there are now nine known de companions to the milky way , six de companions to m31 and one apparently isolated de , tucana .",
    "because of their proximity , these galaxies are the most easily studied examples of what may be the most common type of galaxy in the universe . in the last decade these local systems have been studied in increasing detail and though their evolutionary history is far from completely understood , these de systems are all now relatively well observed objects ( see , for example , recent reviews by da costa 1992 , zinn 1993 & armandroff 1994 ) .",
    "indeed the milky way companion de galaxies show well established relationships between surface brightness , absolute magnitude , length scale and mean abundance which both the m31 de companions and the tucana system also follow .",
    "this would seem to suggest that these relations are characteristic of the de formation process and that this process is not strongly dependent on the environment in which the de systems are found . on the other hand",
    ", there is some evidence that these relations are not universal .",
    "for example , caldwell et al .  (",
    "1992 ) have included the low surface brightness virgo cluster de galaxies from impey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) in a plot of central surface brightness against absolute magnitude for the local group de systems .",
    "they conclude ( cf .",
    "caldwell & bothun 1987 ; impey et al .",
    "1988 ) from this diagram , with its larger sample of de galaxies , that the relationship between surface brightness and absolute magnitude breaks down at faint surface brightness ( @xmath3 ) : below this level de galaxies can be found with a wide range of luminosities .",
    "this immediately raises the question : are the abundances and stellar populations of such low surface brightness systems determined by their total luminosities or by their central surface brightnesses ?",
    "support for either alternative can be found in theoretical models in the literature ( e.g.  phillipps et al .",
    "1990 , bender et al .",
    "but by studying the properties of de galaxies outside the local group , we can begin to answer this question observationally and thus address the broader issue of the extent to which environment affects the properties of these systems .",
    "the m81 group of galaxies is one of the nearest groups to our own .",
    "it contains one large spiral ( m81 ) , two peculiar galaxies ( m82 and ngc 3077 ) , a few small spirals and a large number of dwarf galaxies .",
    "further , there is evidence that a number of substantial interactions have occurred in this group in the recent past ( solinger et al .",
    "1977 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1987 ; yun et al .",
    "thus it provides a quite different environment from that of the local group , enabling the possibility of comparative studies .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the structure and stellar populations of two low surface brightness galaxies in the m81 group .",

    "in a number of papers , borngen and colleagues ( borngen et al .  1982a , 1982b , 1984 ; karachentseva et al .",
    "1984 , 1985 ) have surveyed the m81 group for dwarf galaxies using photographic plates from the tautenberg schmidt telescope , attempting to supplement the catalogs of brighter galaxies such as those of de vaucouleurs ( 1975 ) and kraan - korteweg & tammann ( 1979 ) .",
    "this work ultimately resulted in the catalog of karachentseva et al .",
    "( 1985 ) which listed 37 galaxies as possible dwarf members of the group , down to a quoted photographic magnitude of about 18 .",
    "binggeli ( 1983 ; see also van driel et al .",
    "1997 ) edited this list somewhat , showing 41 galaxies with apparent photographic magnitudes from 8 to 18 .",
    "while the quoted limiting magnitude of 18 corresponds to m@xmath4 , thus placing the candidates in the dwarf spheroidal regime , it seemed to us that a further survey of the group using a ccd as a detector would better explore that luminosity realm . to this end , we obtained new images of the m81 field with the burrell schmidt on kitt peak and a tektronix / stis 2048@xmath52048 ccd , located at the newtonian focus .",
    "this system provides images with a 1 degree field , with 2.03 arcsec / pixel . over the years 1991 - 1994 we obtained 60 overlapping v - band frames around the m81/m82/ngc3077 trio , resulting in an areal coverage of approximately 40 square degrees .",
    "exposure times were 1500 sec . unfortunately , bad weather was a constant companion during the years of observations .",
    "hence most of the frames were taken during good , but not photometric , conditions . as a result , it has proved to be impossible to provide accurate survey limits for all the fields , though our newly detected galaxies tell us that we did go deeper than the photographic surveys .    the areal coverage around m81 is equivalent to a radius of about 180 kpc ; this radius around our galaxy includes all but the two outer galactic dwarf ellipticals leo i & ii . we easily recovered all of the previously cataloged m81-group dwarfs , and found seven more candidates as well .",
    "of these , one was not confirmed on re - observation with a different telescope and one turned out to be a galactic reflection nebula ( common in the m81 group , see sandage 1976 ) .",
    "three others have been confirmed to be dwarf members of the m81 group , all apparently dwarf ellipticals , while the nature of the final two awaits future observations .    in this paper , we report further extensive observations of one of the confirmed new dwarf ellipticals as well as a dwarf elliptical listed in karachentseva et al .",

    "[ combined_pic ] .",
    "this galaxy appears to have a nucleus , off - center by about 2 .",
    "the hst images have revealed this `` nucleus '' in fact to be a background spiral galaxy .",
    "the galaxy from our own survey that we discuss here is named f8d1 ( it was found on our eighth field ) , also shown in fig .",
    "[ combined_pic ] .",
    "it is evident that this galaxy is of very low central surface brightness , yet it is also quite large on the sky , much larger than bk5n .",
    "there is also some apparent asymmetry in the outer isophotes at the faintest levels , which we will discuss further below .",
    "figure [ pos_fig ] shows the position of these two galaxies on the sky with respect to the brighter galaxies in the group .",
    "f8d1 is about 1/2 degree away from the spiral ngc 2976 , corresponding to a separation of 34 kpc if both galaxies are at the distance of m81 ( 3.6 mpc , freedman et al .",
    "in fact , an accurate distance of ngc 2976 is not available , and that of f8d1 is somewhat larger than that of m81 ( see sec .",
    "[ distance ] ) .",
    "the implied tidal radius of f8d1 caused by ngc 2976 would be r@xmath6 = 6.5 kpc ( assuming the same m / l for both galaxies ) , whereas the actual limiting radius of f8d1 , determined from the surface brightness profile , is 5.8 kpc .",
    "it is thus possible that f8d1 is tidally limited by ngc 2976 , if both galaxies are at the same distance .",
    "bk5n lies at a similar angular distance from ngc 3077 , implying a tidal radius for the former galaxy of 2.1 kpc .",
    "the dwarf s actual limiting radius is only 0.9 kpc , so this galaxy might also be tidally limited by the nearby giant , again assuming similar distances ( there is no accurate distance to ngc 3077 either ) .",
    "but it is more probable that the radii of both galaxies were determined during formation , because there are other de s with similar light profiles in clusters that are not near large galaxies ( caldwell & bothun 1987 ) .",
    "our calculations showed that giant branch tip stars in galaxies at the distance of m81 should be resolvable from the ground in excellent seeing .",
    "because of its crude resemblance to the surrounding galactic cirrus , f8d1 was imaged with a ccd on the mdm 2.4 m telescope in the r band during two runs in 1994 and 1997 , in an attempt to verify its nature as a galaxy in the m81 group before proceeding with hst observations .",
    "the 1994 data had 0.7seeing , while the 1997 data had 1.2seeing .",
    "figure [ mdm_pic ] , a mosaic of both ccd frames , reveals that indeed the galaxy is well resolved into stars , including the faint asymmetric outer part to the north . thus the asymmetry is not due to contaminating cirrus but is rather a feature of f8d1 ; however it is a relatively minor contributor to the total luminosity of the galaxy , only a few percent .",
    "it is unlikely that the feature is a tide raised by ngc 2976 , because tides raised on dwarf galaxies by giants are expected to be symmetric ( piatek & pryor 1995 ) .",
    "whatever the cause , other small asymmetries are observed in some of the local group de galaxies ( e.g.  irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) .",
    "bv ccd images from the burrell schmidt and the flwo 1.2 m telescope were used to derive the basic photometric properties and light profiles of these two galaxies .",
    "the techniques described in caldwell et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were employed in the analysis of these images .",
    "photometric zero points were derived from standard stars observed during the nights of observations .",
    "the ellipticity of f8d1 was assumed to be 0.0 , as judged by eye , while that of bk5n was measured via an ellipse fitting program to be 0.4 .",
    "the asymmetry of f8d1 was ignored in the photometry because it contributes only a few percent to the total luminosity .",
    "likewise , the central background galaxy in bk5n contributes about 1% , and was interpolated across in the image before analysis ( which was not completely successful , as the figure still shows a steepening of the profile in the center ) .",
    "figure [ profile_fig ] shows the light profiles , and table [ phot_table ] lists the derived properties .",
    "the profile of f8d1 , while exponential in the outer parts , is shallower than an exponential in the center ; the profile of bk5n is much steeper than an exponential ( common for the faintest de s , see caldwell & bothun 1987 ) .",
    "thus sersic profiles ( i = i@xmath7 , sersic 1968 ) , which have an additional free parameter @xmath8 over an exponential ( which corresponds to @xmath8=1 ) , were fit to the data .",
    "the derived parameters are shown in table [ phot_table ] .",
    "in addition to being much smaller , bk5n has a much steeper profile than f8d1 , judging from the differences in the slope parameter @xmath8 .",
    "a general comparison of the two galaxies reveals f8d1 to be about six times larger in radius than bk5n , even though the latter galaxy has a somewhat higher central surface brightness .",
    "thus f8d1 is much more luminous than bk5n ; it is also slightly redder ( table [ phot_table ] ) , though the photometric errors are large . placing these galaxies in the surface brightness ",
    "luminosity diagram for de s ( fig .",
    "[ sb_lumin_fig ] ) allows some further comments to be made ( the distances used in obtaining the luminosities are derived in sec .  [ distance ] ) .",
    "bk5n is clearly similar to the galactic and m31 dwarf ellipticals - it is small and of low luminosity ( it is also highly flattened ) .",
    "_ f8d1 on the other hand has no counterpart in the local group_. rather , its nearest analogs can be found in the virgo and fornax clusters , which contain a small number of very large , low surface brightness dwarfs , as described by sandage & binggeli ( 1984 ) and studied in detail by impey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and bothun et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , who showed histograms of scale lengths and surface brightnesses for virgo and fornax cluster dwarf ellipticals .",
    "the scale length of f8d1 at virgo would be about 18 - 21which is comparable to the scale lengths of virgo systems v2l8 and v3l1 , for example , de s which have similar central surface brightnesses to f8d1 ( impey et al .  1988 ) . nevertheless fewer than 1% of cataloged virgo or fornax de galaxies with similarly low central surface brightnesses are as large as f8d1 , less than 10 in number . thus f8d1 is a rare type of galaxy , in any environment .",
    "f8d1 is the first such large scale length dwarf galaxy to be resolved into stars . for bk5n ,",
    "the scale length at virgo would be 3 to 4 , which is basically below the current detection limit in those clusters , though as we have noted , it is similar to many of the local group dwarf ellipticals .",
    "finally , from the ground - based images these two galaxies do not appear to have had recent star formation .",
    "huchtmeier & skillman ( 1994 ) and van driel et al .  (",
    "1997 ) have surveyed previously cataloged m81 group galaxies at 21 cm , but did not detect any h i in bk5n . assuming a line width of 24 km / sec ( corresponding to a typical galactic de velocity dispersion of @xmath210 km / sec ) , the 3@xmath9 upper limit for bk5n of 13.5 mjy given by van driel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) corresponds to m@xmath10/l@xmath11 @xmath12 0.4 in solar units , provided the velocity of the dwarf is sufficiently separated from that of the galactic h i. this is not a very strong limit since local group de s have m@xmath13/l@xmath11 @xmath14 10@xmath15 , while the local group dwarfs phoenix and lgs3 , which contain young stars , have h i detections that correspond to m@xmath10/l@xmath11 @xmath1 0.1  0.2 .",
    "deeper h i observations of bk5n , and of f8d1 which has not been observed in h i to our knowledge , are clearly desirable .",
    "to explore the resolved stellar populations of these two galaxies , in particular to measure the distances , the mean stellar metallicities , the metallicity dispersions and the young / intermediate age star content , we observed bk5n and f8d1 with the wfpc2 camera on hst .",
    "previous work on deriving metallicities of old stellar populations has indicated that the giant branches must be observed down to about 2 mags below the tip for greatest accuracy .",
    "if our two dwarfs are at the distance of m81 , this means that stars down to i @xmath2 26 must be observed .",
    "this number dictated the exposure times for our galaxies .",
    "we elected to observe with the f555w and the f814w filters , so that we could transform easily to vi magnitudes , and hence employ the techniques of da  costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) using the i magnitude of the giant branch tip for distance determinations and the ( v - i)@xmath16 color of the giant branch for metallicity measurements .",
    "our objects are located in the so - called `` continuous viewing zone '' of hst , meaning that they could be observed continuously through several orbits .",
    "scheduling difficulties prevented us from obtaining all of the data at a single visit however , hence both galaxies were observed at two different spacecraft orientations .",
    "this meant that ( 1 ) we could not combine the frames themselves together , rather we would have to combine the resultant stellar photometry instead and ( 2 ) the area surveyed at the total exposure depth would only be the overlapping areas of the two visits , rather than the full field of the wfpc2 frames . on the positive side ,",

    "[ combined_overlay ] shows overlays of the wfpc2 footprint for the two visits for each of the galaxies .",
    "most of bk5n will thus be found on the pc frame alone , while even the entire wfpc2 area would not include all of f8d1 , let alone the overlapping areas from the two visits .",
    "the frames were debiased , zero - corrected , dark - subtracted and flat - fielded by the stsci pipeline process before being made available to us .",
    "we then combined the frames for each filter and visit using the stsdas routine gcombine , which effectively removes cosmic rays . since we would be doing point source photometry , we also needed to restore the photometric flatness of the images , which had been changed by the flat - fielding process ( which corrects for effect of geometric distortion of the images on extended objects at the expense of introducing a non - flatness for point sources ) .",
    "the frames were multiplied by the so - called `` geometric - distortion '' frame to accomplish the correction .",

    "[ f8d1_wfpc2 ] shows the full wfpc2 field for f8d1 .",
    "it is clear that both galaxies are well - resolved into stars , and that stellar photometry would not be compromised by the minimal crowding .",
    "as mentioned above , bk5n seems to be nucleated from the ground based images , with the `` nucleus '' 2offcenter .",
    "( note that the `` n '' in the name given by karachentseva et al .",
    "1985 refers to `` new '' , not `` nucleated '' . )",
    "the pc image shows that this `` nucleus '' is in fact a background spiral galaxy ( see enlargement in fig .  [ nuc_gal_pic ] ) , with v ",
    "i = 1.2 , typical for field galaxies of its magnitude ( see driver et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were measured from the combined frames using conventional digital aperture photometry , as implemented in the iraf package daophot .",
    "in particular , the find task was used to identify the stars , and the phot task provided the photometry .",
    "an aperture radius of 2.0 pixels was used for both the wf and pc frames .",
    "the next step was to determine the aperture correction from the 2-pixel - radius apertures to the standard aperture size for the wfpc2 photometric system , 0.5 arcsec in radius ( holtzman et al .",
    "these aperture corrections were measured using fairly bright , uncrowded stars . because only a few suitable stars , at most , were present on each ccd , we were forced to ignore any spatial variations in the aperture corrections .",
    "thus , for each visit and filter , we adopted a single aperture correction for the wf frames and another for the pc frame .",
    "as noted in da costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , ignoring the spatial variation in the aperture corrections results in only a second order effect on the colors . after applying the aperture corrections",
    ", we corrected for exposure time and the gain factors for each ccd ( following holtzman et al .",
    "we also eliminated stars found on the vignetted regions of the ccds ( x@xmath1275 , y@xmath1275 for the wf ccds ; x@xmath12100 , y@xmath12100 for the pc ) and a small number of obvious galaxies .",
    "we derived transformation equations between the coordinate system of the first visit and that of the second visit for each galaxy and filter .",
    "this allowed us to match the photometry for stars in common between the two visits . because the wfpc2 orientation on the second visit for each galaxy is rotated significantly from the orientation on the first visit ( see fig .",
    "[ combined_overlay ] ) , comparing the magnitudes during the two visits yields information on the charge - transfer ramp effect ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) during our observations . in plots of magnitude difference between the two visits versus change in y",
    "coordinate , we could see no evidence of the charge - transfer ramp .",
    "this may be a consequence of our relatively long exposure times , and hence relatively high background levels . in any case",
    ", we decided not to apply any charge transfer ramp correction .",
    "next , we combined the corrected magnitudes for the two visits weighted according to their uncertainties and only retained stars that had photometry on both visits in both filters . finally , we transformed from the instrumental system to standard @xmath17 using the zeropoints and color terms of table 7 of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we have compared the uncertainties in the i magnitudes and v ",
    "i colors based on photon statistics with the uncertainties implied by the repeatability of the magnitudes and colors between the two visits .",
    "table [ error_tab ] lists , as a function of i magnitude , the mean uncertainties based on photon statistics ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and those based on repeatability between the two visits ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) after excluding variable stars ( see sec .  [ variables ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties computed by the two methods agree very well at magnitudes fainter than i @xmath1 24.5 .",
    "brighter than this , the repeatability uncertainties do not decrease as rapidly as those based on the photon statistics , particularly for the i magnitudes .",
    "this suggests that there are contributions from effects such as flat fielding , dark subtraction , or the frame combination process , for example , which limit the errors at the brighter magnitudes .",
    "such a result was also noted by da  costa et al .",
    "in addition to these photometric errors , we will also consider in the subsequent analysis the effects of a possible @xmath220.05 mag systematic zeropoint uncertainty .",
    "this comes from the uncertainty in the aperture corrections ( @xmath230.04 mag ) and from uncertainty in the zeropoint of the transformed photometry relative to the standard system ( @xmath220.03 mag ) .",

    "this difference is acceptably small and indicates that our adoption of @xmath12[fe / h]@xmath27 = 1.7 @xmath22 0.25 for bk5n is unlikely to be significantly in error .    the standard deviation in ( v  i ) color for the sample of bk5n giants used in the mean abundance determination is 0.075 mag , larger than that expected from the errors in the photometry at this magnitude ( 0.050 mag ) .",

    "this error contribution from the observed dispersion then yields an intrinsic ( v  i ) color dispersion of .",
    "the error in this color dispersion is derived from its variation as the sample changes due to shifts in the adopted modulus of order @xmath220.15 mag .",
    "armandroff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) noted that at this luminosity ( m@xmath34 = 3.5 ) , the asymptotic and red giant branches in globular clusters are essentially coincident , so for a single age population , any intrinsic color dispersion can be interpreted as an intrinsic abundance dispersion .",
    "however , in bk5n there is evidence from the c - m diagram that suggests the existence of a range of ages in this dwarf ( see following section ) . as a result , the intrinsic color spread on the giant branch will contain a component from the age distribution as well as from the intrinsic abundance distribution .",
    "fortunately , the effective temperature ( and hence v  i color ) of a red giant branch star is much more sensitive to abundance than it is to the star s mass ( age ) .",
    "thus we are justified in interpreting the intrinsic color dispersion primarily as the consequence of an intrinsic abundance dispersion in bk5n , though the quantitative value should be recognized as an upper limit on the true abundance dispersion . with this caveat ,",
    "the abundance calibration then yields for bk5n .",
    "this value of @xmath9([fe / h ] ) for bk5n is consistent with those for local group de s .",

    "the uncertainty given here includes contributions from the abundance calibration ( 0.08 dex ) , the statistical uncertainty from the sample ( 0.02 dex ) , the effect of a @xmath220.05 mag uncertainty in the zeropoint and a @xmath220.02 mag uncertainty in e(b ",

    "we find an abundance higher by 0.13 @xmath22 0.11 dex , also with the error including only the statistical and calibration uncertainties , a difference that is again satisfactorily small .",
    "moreover , it is apparent that the difference in mean abundance between bk5n and f8d1 , @xmath10.7 dex , is independent of the luminosity on the red giant branch at which the mean abundances are determined .    for the sample of stars used in determining ( v  i)@xmath32 for f8d1 ,",
    "the average photon statistics error in ( v  i ) is 0.083 mag while the color error inferred from the repeat measurements is 0.086 mag .",
    "both of these quantities are considerably less than the observed color dispersion @xmath36(v ",

    "the uncertainty given reflects the change in @xmath36(v ",

    "again as for bk5n , given the likely existence of an age range in f8d1 , this value is strictly an upper limit on the true abundance dispersion .",
    "it is illustrative to compare this value for the abundance dispersion in f8d1 with values for local group dwarf systems .",
    "for example , sagar et al .  (",
    "1990 ) give @xmath9([fe / h ] ) = 0.31 @xmath22 0.05 for the fornax de from the intrinsic ( b  v ) width of the giant branch under the assumption of no internal age variation .",
    "alternatively , they give @xmath9([fe / h ] ) = 0.27 @xmath22 0.06 if there is an age variation of between 3 and 17 gyr in this de .",
    "these values are similar to that found for f8d1 which is somewhat more luminous , though of lower surface brightness , than fornax .",
    "the other local group object with which comparison seems appropriate is the de galaxy ngc  147 , which is @xmath20.7 mag more luminous than f8d1 .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have studied ngc  147 in detail using hst observations and have employed a similar analysis to that used here ; a direct comparison is then possible . at ,",

    "i ) = 0.13 for their outer ngc  147 field ( the same value as found by mould et al .",
    "1983 from ground - based data at a larger radial distance ) , while for f8d1 we find @xmath37(v ",
    "i ) = 0.11 @xmath22 0.02 ( at m@xmath31 = 3.0 ) . using the da  costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) calibration at the appropriate ( v  i)@xmath35 color ,",
    "these values translate to @xmath9([fe / h ] ) = 0.42 and @xmath9([fe / h ] ) = 0.27 @xmath22 0.04 for ngc  147 and f8d1 , respectively .",
    "it appears then that the abundance distribution in f8d1 is somewhat narrower than it is in the outer parts of ngc  147 .",
    "of course it has to be kept in mind that the presence of an age range in both galaxies ( han et al .",
    "1997 ; section 7 ) means that these abundance dispersions are strictly upper limits .",
    "it is , however , reassuring to note that the value of @xmath9([fe / h ] ) derived for f8d1 at m@xmath31 = 3.0 agrees with that found at the higher luminosity .",
    "one final point deserves comment here . although the f8d1 data shown in the c - m diagram of fig .",
    "[ f8d1_cmd ] do not cover a substantial fraction of the galaxy s extent , it is nevertheless of interest to investigate whether there is any indication of a radial gradient in the mean giant branch color . to do this",

    "the difference ( inner@xmath40outer ) of 0.010 @xmath22 0.032 mag thus offers no support for the existence of a radial abundance gradient in f8d1 , at least within @xmath21 core radius .",
    "the 3@xmath9 upper limit on any possible change in abundance between the two regions is 0.20 dex .",
    "similarly , the bk5n sample has been split into two groups divided at a ( geometric ) radius of 330 pc pixels , or @xmath215@xmath28 which is approximately 1 core radius or 0.8 r@xmath39 . for the inner sample ( v - i)@xmath32 = 1.353 @xmath22 0.017 ( 20 stars )",
    "while for the outer sample ( v - i)@xmath32 = 1.383 @xmath22 0.031 ( 6 stars ) .",

    "the corresponding 3@xmath9 upper limit on any possible change in abundance between these two groups is @xmath20.4 dex .",
    "these results are consistent with those for the local group galaxies ngc  147 ( han et al .",
    "1997 ) and and  i ( da  costa et al .",
    "1996 ) where in neither case was any strong evidence found to support the existence of a radial abundance gradient .",
    "it is immediately apparent from figs .",
    "[ bk5n_cmd ] and [ f8d1_cmd ] that both these galaxies contain significant numbers of stars that lie above the red giant branch tip .",
    "the lack of stars brighter than i @xmath1 24 in the `` field '' regions of fig .",
    "[ field_cmd ] strongly suggests that the majority , if not all , of these stars are members of their respective galaxies . the high incidence of variability among this population ( cf .",
    "[ variables_plot ] ) is a further testament to the membership of these stars .",
    "indeed , in bk5n 5 out of 14 ( 36% ) stars brighter than i = 23.8 are listed as probable or certain variables while 39 out of 158 ( 25% ) stars brighter than i = 23.9 in f8d1 are similarly listed .",
    "undoubtedly these variable star fractions are lower limits on their true values , given that we have data at only two epochs .",
    "the existence of stars with luminosities above that of the red giant branch tip , i.e.  upper - agb stars , is , in populations with [ fe / h ] @xmath14 1.0 , an unambiguous signature of the presence of an intermediate - age population , a population whose age is considerably less than that of the galactic globulars .",
    "generally , on an age scale where the galactic globular clusters are @xmath213  15 gyr old , an intermediate - age population is taken to be one whose age is less than @xmath210 gyr .",
    "the luminosity that an agb star reaches before it sheds its remaining envelope as a planetary nebula , with the core becoming a white dwarf , is dependent on the envelope mass .",
    "all other things being equal , a younger star will have a larger envelope mass and can then evolve to higher luminosities on the agb than an older star .",
    "thus the maximum luminosity observed on the upper - agb can serve as an age indicator .",
    "there are , however , two things that must be kept in mind when using this technique .",
    "first , since the agb termination luminosity is a function of envelope mass , anything that changes the envelope mass will affect the luminosity evolution .",
    "in particular , these low surface gravity , high luminosity stars will undergo significant mass loss on the agb .",
    "theoretically , this mass loss can be parameterized in a number of ways , but the details of the evolution will be sensitive to the adopted mass loss law ( see , for example , appendix a of gallart et al .",
    "second , upper - agb evolution is rapid so that a reasonable sample of upper - agb stars is required in order to provide a valid estimate of the agb termination luminosity .",
    "we will be concerned with estimating two quantities for these dwarf galaxies from our data : first , a limit on the age of the intermediate - age population from the luminosity of the brightest upper - agb stars , and second , an estimate of the fraction of the total population of each dwarf that exists as intermediate - age stars . as discussed , for example , by da  costa ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the local group de galaxies show a large and surprising variety of intermediate - age population fractions , from essentially none in systems such as ursa minor to substantial in systems such as carina , fornax and leo i. we begin with bk5n .      for bk5n , the mean metal abundance and metal abundance dispersion derived in sec .",
    "[ metallicity ] suggest that it is unlikely that there are any stars in this dwarf galaxy with abundances exceeding [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.0 ( see also fig .",
    "[ bk5n_cmd ] ) . consequently ,",
    "if the stellar population of bk5n consisted entirely of stars comparable in age to the galactic globular clusters , then we would not expect to see any stars with luminosities above that of the red giant branch tip ( e.g.  frogel & elias 1988 , renzini 1992 ) .",
    "clearly this is not the case in fig .",
    "[ bk5n_cmd ] and we can immediately conclude that bk5n _ contains an intermediate - age population_.    using the bolometric corrections to i - band magnitudes from da  costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) and the distance modulus from sec .",
    "[ distance ] , we have calculated bolometric magnitudes for the 14 stars brighter than i = 23.8 in fig .  [ bk5n_cmd ] . with the exception of one star at m@xmath41 @xmath1 4.9 which we will discuss",
    "shortly , the luminosity function of the other stars indicates that the agb termination luminosity in bk5n is m@xmath41 @xmath1 4.3 ; 5 of the 13 stars have bolometric magnitudes at , or @xmath250.2 mag fainter than , this value .",
    "there are two approaches to interpreting this value : empirical and theoretical .",
    "empirically , we note that the value for bk5n is fainter than the luminosity of the brightest ( upper - agb ) carbon stars in the leo  i and carina local group de s , for which azzopardi ( 1994 ) gives m@xmath41 @xmath1 4.5 and m@xmath41 @xmath1 4.6 , respectively . both these de galaxies have substantial intermediate - age populations containing stars as young as a few gyr ( e.g.  lee et al .  1993c , smecker - hane et al .",
    "1994 ) . on the other hand azzopardi ( 1994 )",
    "lists m@xmath41 @xmath1 4.4 for the brightest carbon stars in leo ii .",
    "mighell & rich ( 1996 ) have concluded that this de galaxy contains only stars older than @xmath27 gyr with a `` typical '' leo ii member having an age of 9 gyr .",
    "similarly , the brightest carbon star in the smc cluster kron 3 , which has an age of @xmath29 gyr ( rich et al .",
    "1984 , alcaino et al .  1996 ) , has a luminosity of m@xmath41 @xmath1 4.2 ( frogel et al .  1990 ) .",
    "all these stellar systems have mean abundances that are similar to bk5n .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to conclude that bk5n , like many of the local group de s , has had an extended period of star formation , forming stars until @xmath28 gyr ago .    the single bright star ( at i @xmath1 22.6 , v ",
    "i @xmath1 1.7 ) in the bk5n c - m diagram , if a member , offers a somewhat different interpretation .",
    "this star is well isolated in the c - m diagram which might suggest non - membership .",
    "however , it is also a probable variable in that the v magnitudes for the two epochs differ by 0.17 mag , though the i magnitudes differ by only 0.01 mag .",
    "if it is a member , then it has m@xmath41",
    "@xmath1 4.9 , which , interpreted as an agb termination luminosity , suggests an age of 2  3 gyr .",
    "unfortunately , there is no way at the present time we can definitely establish the membership of this star in bk5n .    the context for a theoretical interpretation of these results is provided by the bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) isochrones , since these include the evolution of stars through the upper - agb phase . however , it is not clear that at the metallicities appropriate for bk5n these isochrones offer much insight . as noted above ,",
    "the agb termination luminosity is dependent on the envelope mass , which is in turn determined by the mass loss rate . in the bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) isochrones the mass loss rate at a fixed luminosity is a strong function of the effective temperature ( i.e.  radius ) of the agb star .",
    "thus the relatively blue metal - poor agb stars , as parameterized , undergo less significant mass loss as they ascend the agb . consequently , and particularly for the most metal - poor case which corresponds to the mean abundance of bk5n , the theoretical agb tip luminosities are at m@xmath41 @xmath1 4.8 even for ages of 8 to 10 gyr . indeed , even for globular cluster like ages , the metal - poor bertelli et al .",

    "this procedure makes use of the formalism developed by renzini & buzzoni ( 1986 ) for the v band in which the number of agb stars expected from a total population characterized by a total luminosity l@xmath42 is given by :    n@xmath43 = 4 @xmath5 10@xmath44 l@xmath42 t@xmath43    here n@xmath43 is the number of upper - agb stars per magnitude and t@xmath43 is the upper - agb evolutionary rate in myr / mag . using t@xmath43 = 1.3 ( mould 1992 ) and m@xmath42 = 11.3 ( reduced by the fraction of the bk5n total luminosity contained on the pc frames , which is one - third ) , the 13 upper - agb stars between 23.8 @xmath45 i @xmath45 22.8 yield an intermediate - age population fraction for bk5n of 0.3 @xmath22 0.1 .",
    "the error is simply the statistical error in the sample of bk5n upper - agb stars .",
    "this intermediate - age population fraction is considerably larger than the 0.1 @xmath22 0.1 fractions calculated using this technique for the m31 de companions and  i and and  iii by armandroff et al .",
    "it suggests that bk5n is perhaps analogous to other local group systems such as carina and leo  i which have substantial intermediate - age populations .",

    "clearly , whatever the mechanism for producing the significant extended star formation histories seen in these galaxies is , it is not restricted to local group dwarfs .",

    "@xmath1 5.0 , the most luminous stars in f8d1 probably have ages of a few gyr using either the lmc cluster data ( e.g.  frogel et al .  1990 , mould & da costa 1988 ) for calibration , or through noting that the galactic companion de s fornax , carina and leo  i have carbon stars of comparable luminosity together with populations of this age , identified from main sequence turnoff magnitudes ( see , for example , da  costa 1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the brightest stars in f8d1 are @xmath20.7 mag brighter than those in bk5n ( putting aside the one bright bk5n star mentioned previously ) , and thus it would appear that the epoch of last significant star formation is different by perhaps 4  5 gyr in these two m81 group de galaxies .",

    "it is equally apparent though that a significant range of ( intermediate ) ages is present .",

    "galactic globulars have half - light radii in the range of 2 to 10 pc ( see e.g. , djorgovski & meylan 1994 ) , so we would expect any globulars in our two dwarfs to have half - light radii in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 . thus such objects would be difficult to distinguish from stars in ground - based data , but such a task lies within the capabilities of hst .",
    "we searched for globulars in these two galaxies by first checking the hst frames for appropriate resolved objects , and then measuring their colors .",
    "cluster candidates were those objects whose colors and morphologies matched what we expect for clusters at the distance of these two galaxies .",
    "for f8d1 we are limited by the area covered by the hst images : only about 3/4 of the area out to r@xmath39 was observed ( or about 15% of the area out to the limiting radius of the light profile )  an important shortcoming since the fornax dwarf , for example , has some globulars out to 2r@xmath39 . being much smaller , bk5n s areal coverage was about 80% out to the limiting radius .",
    "while no likely candidates were found in the images of bk5n , several candidates were identified in f8d1 , one of which has both the color expected for a globular , and an appearance that matches that of a star cluster more than that of a background galaxy . in fact , it appears that stars in this object , which we have designated f8d1-gc1 , are partially resolved .",

    "we have found one good candidate globular cluster in f8d1 , which is about what we would expect given the relatively high luminosity of f8d1 and the lack of coverage of the entire galaxy with the hst images .",
    "none were found in bk5n , again as we expected given the low luminosity of this galaxy .",
    "we now compare these two dwarf ellipticals with others from the local group that are equally well - studied .",

    "its effective radius is in fact larger than any of the 15 known local group dwarf ellipticals ( including ngc 205 ) , by at least a factor of 3 , and indeed is larger than that of the smc and only 15% smaller than that of the lmc ( bothun & thompson 1988 ) . the radius of the recently discovered sgr galaxy appears to be large , but an accurate number is not yet at hand ( ibata et al .  1997 ) .",
    "its large ellipticity ( e @xmath1 0.7 ) and small galactocentric distance ( 16 kpc ) suggest that the structure of sgr has been modified by tidal interactions with the galaxy .",

    "clearly , some physical process during formation drives most of these galaxies to smaller radii in the mean than we see in f8d1 .",
    "explaining how such large galaxies come about must involve the role of supernovae or stellar winds , and would appear to be a central problem for the formation of dwarf galaxies .",
    "an additional diagnostic relation for de s is the relation between luminosity and metallicity ( l  z , here we assume that [ fe / h ] measures z ) , wherein the lower luminosity galaxies have correspondingly lower metallicities . because lower luminosity galaxies also tend to have lower surface brightness , there is as well a general trend of metallicity with central surface brightness ( e.g. , caldwell et al .",

    "f8d1 clearly falls near the l  z relation but deviates significantly from the v@xmath53z relation .",

    "<S> the i magnitudes of the red giant branch tip in both galaxies yield distances that are consistent with membership in the m81 group . </S>",
    "<S> surface brightness and total magnitude measurements indicate that bk5n and f8d1 have similar central surface brightness ( 24.5 and 25.4 mag / arcsec@xmath0 in v , respectively ) , but f8d1 s larger length scale results in it being 3 magnitudes more luminous than bk5n . </S>",
    "<S> bk5n lies on the relation between central surface brightness and absolute magnitude defined by local group dwarf ellipticals , but f8d1 does not . </S>",
    "<S> f8d1 is more luminous for its central surface brightness than the relation predicts , similar to the large low surface brightness dwarf galaxies found in , for example , virgo . </S>",
    "<S> the mean color of the giant branch is used to establish the mean abundance of each galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> f8d1 , the more luminous galaxy , is significantly more metal rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.0 ) than bk5n ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> both bk5n and f8d1 lie on the relation between absolute magnitude and metal abundance defined by local group dwarf ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> however , as regards the relation between central surface brightness and metal abundance , bk5n again follows the local group dwarfs , while f8d1 deviates significantly from this relation . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the total amount of luminous matter is more fundamental in controlling metal enrichment than the surface density of luminous matter . </S>",
    "<S> we have also used the color width of the giant branch compared with the photometric errors to establish abundance ranges in both galaxies , the sizes of which are comparable to those in local group de s . from the numbers and luminosities of asymptotic giant branch stars more luminous than the red giant branch tip , we infer that , again like many of the local group de s , both bk5n and f8d1 have had extended epochs of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> f8d1 contains stars as young as 3  4 gyr , while in bk5n stars as young as @xmath28 gyr are present . </S>",
    "<S> the fractions of intermediate - age population , at @xmath230% , are similar in both galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> further , one globular cluster has been found in f8d1 , but none are present in bk5n . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers of clusters are consistent with our expectations from local group dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find that bk5n is similar in all respects to the local group de s . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in spite of the different environments of the m81 group and the local group , dwarf galaxies of very similar properties are present in each group . </S>",
    "<S> f8d1 , on the other hand , has no local group counterpart and is indeed rare even in large clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our study of its stellar population is the first for a large low surface brightness dwarf . </S>"
