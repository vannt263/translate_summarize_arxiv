    "the phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in quasi two dimensional copper oxides and other aspects of unconventional behavior observed in these systems are far from being understood by the community of physicists .",
    "nevertheless much evidence has been got that the magnetism of these compounds influences their transport properties .",
    "for example , an anomalous suppression of the critical temperature in superconducting @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the doping parameter @xmath5 in the vicinity of the commensurate level @xmath0 @xcite has been associated with the formation of charge and spin order @xcite .",
    "according to such a scenario which is based on neutron - scattering studies this ordering takes the form of stripes which may be viewed as charge filled dws between af regions that are formed in each copper - oxygen plane .",
    "that plane constitutes the most important building block in the crystallographic structure of cuprates . the phase of the staggered magnetization in domains changes by @xmath6 across each dw .",
    "no direct measurements , which could determine the magnetic structure of dws , have been performed .",
    "it is believed that the essential part of cuprate physics takes place in the single cooper - oxygen plane .",
    "thus , we will concentrate on this structure from now on .",
    "there exists much evidence both experimental and theoretical , that the @xmath7-@xmath8 model on the square lattice is well suited to describe the physics of the single copper oxygen plane .",
    "axes of horizontal or vertical stripes which are regions with enhanced content of holes and which simultaneously form dws may lead either through sites ( in the case of so called site - centered stripes ) or through centers of bonds ( in the case of so called bond - centered stripes ) . in the framework of the theoretical model these sites and bonds form the square lattice at which the @xmath9 m is defined .",
    "it has been pointed out in recent papers @xcite that some high - energy excitations observed in neutron - scattering studies of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are distinct from conventional spin waves which propagate in the af and are similar to excitations which are measured in two - leg spin ladders .",
    "much evidence has been obtained that the formation of the spin - peierls order determines the physics of excitations in undoped and doped af two - leg ladders @xcite .",
    "for example , an excitation which propagates in undoped system may be viewed as a bond triplet that moves in the background of bond singlets .",
    "the relevance of bond order , which takes the form of the spin - peierls state , to behavior of doped 2d afs and cuprates in particular , was suggested already some time ago @xcite .",
    "a class of states which have been discussed in this context comprises those having @xmath12 , because each spin finds a partner to form a bond singlet .",
    "since there are many choices for the partner with which a given spin may pair up , the system may fluctuate between different configurations .",
    "the theory of strong fluctuations between many configurations with different patterns of bond singlets covering the whole lattice , is called the resonating valence bond picture @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on a scenario according to which fluctuations between different configurations are limited to small regions and a given pattern of bond ordering dominates",
    ". theories of insulating states in cuprates with af order in domains were being developed already in late 80-ties @xcite .",
    "here we will try to answer the question if a unifying picture of coexisting magnetically ordered domains and dws with the dominating spin - peierls order provides the correct description of the stripe state in cuprates .",
    "in particular , we will try to check if the bond - centered , bond - ordered , hole - filled stripe is more stable than the narrow site - centered stripe .",
    "later we will also analyze how doping and the formation of a stripe superlattice influences the outcome of the competition between these two types of structure . through the paper",
    "we assume that the bond - centered stripe may be viewed as a dw which resembles a two - leg ladder filled with holes .",
    "the detailed plan of our analysis looks as follows .",
    "first we will discuss the motion of holes along the bond - centered ladder - like stripe with the spin - peierls order either on rungs or on legs .",
    "next we will calculate the energy of the `` narrow '' site - centered dw in the undoped quantum 2d af and for the same system the energy of the `` wide '' dw which resembles the bond - ordered two - leg ladder .",
    "finally , by calculating the energy at given linear hole - filling we will compare the stability of the site - centered stripe with the stability of the bond - centered stripe in the 2d hole - doped quantum af .",
    "we will also discuss how doping and the formation of a stripe array influences the underlying magnetic structure of stripes and their shape .",
    "we consider stripes which are formed in the doped af between anti - phase domains as dws filled with holes .",
    "it is not evident , at first glance , what is the magnetic structure of these dws .",
    "the most obvious possible form of a single filled dw , which has been discussed in the literature , is a single chain of sites with the higher density of holes .",
    "that chain separates two af domains with the opposite direction of sublattice magnetization .",
    "it is expected that the behavior of charge and spin excitations in the stripe of that kind resembles the physics of the @xmath7-@xmath8 model ( @xmath9 m ) in one dimension ( 1d ) , the characteristic feature of which is the separation of spin and charge @xcite .",
    "we consider a different scenario according to which the stripe is formed when the dw which takes the form of a two - leg ladder is filled with holes .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of bond order formation in the ladder - like dw either on rungs or on legs .",
    "the isolated two - leg ladder is already an interesting object to analyze @xcite . in copper - oxides ,",
    "ladder - like arrangements of @xmath13 atoms develop in the @xmath14 planes containing line defects @xcite .",
    "spin ladders display short range singlet correlations and gap in the spin spectrum @xcite .",
    "systems with this type of behavior are often described by models of spin liquids or dimer solids .",
    "as we have already mentioned , by analogy with the two - leg ladder we analyze in this paper the dw which consists of two chains that form the ladder .",
    "we also assume that spin singlets develop either on legs or on rungs in the dw .",
    "the motion of a hole in the two - leg ladder is completely different in character than the motion of a hole in the af background @xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction gives rise to formation of singlets on rungs .",
    "the hoping of the single hole between two sites along the same rung favors an even bonding state .",
    "the bonding state represents , by definition , a single fermion on the rung with a well - defined spin .",
    "the propagation of the hole along the ladder is related to a process during which the bonding fermion and the singlet on nearest rungs exchange their positions .",
    "therefore , the motion of the hole in the ladder may be represented to lowest order by a tight binding model of spin-@xmath15 fermions @xcite .",
    "the hopping parameter related to the propagation of the bonding fermionic state is reduced by a factor of @xmath16 relative to the value @xmath7 of the bare hopping parameter .",
    "if the dw between two af dws has the form of a ladder it is also natural to consider the formation of singlets on legs as a possible form of bond order .",
    "there exists some evidence that the af order is formed in cuprates in hole - poor domains separated by hole - rich stripes @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the phase of the staggered magnetization changes across each dw between af domains by @xmath6 .",
    "the motion of a hole in the af is governed by an energy scale @xmath17 which is lower than @xmath7 or @xmath18 . the hopping hole shifts spins and creates defects in the af ordered state .",
    "the presence of defects brings about an increase of energy and confinement of the hole @xcite . that confinement is not perfect because the defects may be annihilated by the exchange term in the hamiltonian which flips antiparallel spins on nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites . in our calculation",
    "we do not consider the coherent propagation of holes in the af .",
    "this motion is mediated by the exchange term @xmath19 , and it thus is a higher order process .",
    "this process may give rise to tunneling between stripes .",
    "we neglect effects related to it in the quantitative analysis , but we will later discuss consequences which it may have for the form of the stripe phase .",
    "now , we temporarily concentrate on the anisotropic version of the @xmath9 m which is the @xmath20 model ( @xmath20 m ) defined by the hamiltonian @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes a pair of nn sites .",
    "the hilbert space is restricted to states representing configurations without doubly occupied sites .",
    "the @xmath9 m contains an additional term , @xmath24 which is needed in order to give the exchange interaction the isotropic form .",
    "we start with the discussion of hole motion inside the ladder - like dw with bond order on rungs .",
    "the physics of this motion is different in one aspect from the propagation of a hole in the ladder .",
    "the exchange interaction with the af ordered domains acts on the dw as an effective staggered magnetic field .",
    "we may assume for convenience , that spins up occupy sites in domains on both sides of odd numbered rungs in the dw , as it has been presented in fig.[str](a ) , where numbers which label rungs are explicitly shown .",
    "an oval represents a bond singlet .",
    "the bonding state on a rung is an even combination @xmath25 of states @xmath26 and @xmath27 representing a single fermion with spin @xmath28 on the left site and on the right site in the m - th rung respectively , fig.[str](b ) and ( c ) . apart from the m - th rung which is in the state @xmath26 or @xmath29 all rungs are occupied by singlets .",
    "the hopping energy along the rung achieves its minimum value in the bonding state .",
    "since the problem of the hole moving along the ladder - like stripe with bond order on rungs posses the axial symmetry , without any loss of generality we will later use in our considerations even combination of reflected states representing holes residing on both sides of the stripe axis .",
    "the bonding state ( [ vfobs ] ) is an example of such an even state .",
    "the meaning of the label `` @xmath30 '' in eq.([vfobs ] ) will become clear later .",
    "greek letters in fig.[str ] represent spins , @xmath31 and a circle denotes a hole ( an empty site ) . for the matrix elements of the hopping term @xmath32 in the @xmath9 m or the @xmath20 m we have @xmath33 the contribution to energy from the magnetic part of the @xmath20 m from states @xmath26 and @xmath34 , fig.[str](b ) and ( c ) , is higher if spins @xmath35 and @xmath28 are parallel and has a lower value if they are antiparallel . for parallel spins that contribution is higher by @xmath36 relative to the energy of the empty dw , fig.[ldw](a ) . for antiparallel spins",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath28 , the magnetic contribution to energy from the single fermion on a rung , fig.[str](b ) or ( c ) , does not increase relative to the energy of a rung occupied by the singlet .",
    "a state representing the single spin - up bonding fermion which propagates inside the ladder - like dw with the spin - peierls order on rungs is given by the coherent sum , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the momentum in the direction parallel to the stripe .",
    "it is probably worth to stress here , that the motion of the hole is now restricted by definition to the dw , which is modeled by the two - leg ladder .",
    "two different parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 have been introduced for odd and even numbers labelling rungs , because the energy of the spin - spin interaction between the fermion in the dw and spins in the domains is different in the @xmath20 m for fermions occupying even and odd rungs .",
    "@xmath41 denotes the total length of the stripe .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath32 between bonding states on nn rungs is @xcite , @xmath42 by collecting all matrix elements we may deduce that the amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath39 obey the eigenstate equation , @xmath43 where @xmath44.\\ ] ] the groundstate of @xmath45 is given by the following solution of ( [ hpl ] ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes a real normalization constant .",
    "the groundstate eigenenergy @xmath48 is @xmath49 the interaction of the bonding fermion with the nearest spin in domains generates some effective magnetic field .",
    "since this effective magnetic field which acts on the propagating bonding fermion is staggered , the effective elementary cell gets doubled in the direction parallel to the dw .",
    "thus , the first brillouin zone ( 1bz ) of the stripe gets reduced by a factor of 2 and the quasiparticle band becomes split into a bonding band and an anti - bonding band . from now , @xmath48 in ( [ hpl ] ) will represent the energy of the bonding band which may be filled twice in the reduced bz by propagating rung fermions with spin up or down .",
    "now we proceed to discuss the motion of the hole in the direction transversal to the dw .",
    "the hole which enters an af domain leaves a sequence of defects on its way .",
    "it must retreat to the stripe along the line formed by these defects , in order to repair them .",
    "the basis of states , which may be used to describe the hole motion along the dw consists of wavefunctions obtained during consecutive hopping in the domain , without retreats , of the hole which has started from a site in the dw @xcite .",
    "the creation of a next state belonging to this basis is mediated by the hopping term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the recursion method is an approach useful to analyze a hamiltonian @xmath50 acting in a basis which consists of states created by applying consecutively that hamiltonian to a given initial state @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this method has been already applied to discuss the hole motion in the ising af @xcite and to discuss the hole propagation along the narrow dw @xcite .",
    "before we use that approach to the analysis of the composite hole - motion along the ladder - like dw we will shortly sketch basic principles of the recursion method . in general , any hamiltonian generates a basis of orthogonal states according to the following set of rules , @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "an additional assumption is that none of states created according to the recipe ( [ srm ] ) vanishes .",
    "the hamiltonian is tridiagonal in the basis formed by states @xmath54 and its eigenenergies may be found by analyzing the poles of the diagonal green s function @xmath55 which takes the form of a continued fraction , @xmath56 as we have already mentioned , the hopping of holes in the ladder favors , in terms of energy , the even bonding states on rungs occupied by a single fermion , while the exchange interaction favors the singlets on rungs occupied by two fermions .",
    "we choose a coherent sum of states representing the bonding state and the singlets on rungs ( [ chm ] ) for the state @xmath57 which we will apply in the recurrence method . to use that state implies explicitly the assumption that the motion of the hole along the ladder - like stripe has two components .",
    "the motion inside the dw is analogous to the propagation between rungs of the bonding state , while the motion of the hole which has left the dw and has entered a domain is governed by processes related to the formation of spin polarons in the af background @xcite . by acting successively with the kinetic part of the @xmath20 m on the state which represents the hole created in the dw we create string - like states representing the hole that enters a domain from a given rung in the ladder - like dw . here , by a string",
    "is meant a line consisting of defects created in the domain by the hopping hole which has started from a given site in the dw .",
    "a combination of states obtained in this way may be viewed as a spin polaron pinned to the ladder at the rung to which belongs the initial site from which the hole has commenced its motion .",
    "the recurrence approach provides a convenient method to construct string states by applying the hopping term to the wave function ( [ chm ] ) .",
    "since ( [ chm ] ) alone represents the coherent motion between rungs of the bonding fermion , it is clear that such a construction takes into account the composite character of the hole motion along the stripe .",
    "the whole procedure looks in detail as follows .",
    "we use the state @xmath58 as the initial state @xmath51 in the recurrence procedure .",
    "states @xmath59 , @xmath60 are obtained by the consecutive action of the hopping term and represent hopping of the hole inside domains .",
    "as we have already stated , the initial state @xmath61 accounts for the component of the hole motion which is related to the propagation of the bonding rung - state inside the dw .",
    "the matrix element @xmath62 in the continued fraction ( [ rm ] ) can be deduced from the form of the hamiltonian ( [ hpl ] ) @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{j}{2 } |\\beta_{o,\\uparrow}(k_{\\parallel})|^2 .",
    "\\label{1h1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ising contribution to energy from the hamiltonian @xmath64 of @xmath20 m in the previous expression is measured relative to the energy of the empty dw .",
    "since @xmath39 and @xmath40 define the groundstate of ( [ hpl ] ) , the matrix element ( [ 1h1 ] ) reaches for that choice of @xmath39 and @xmath40 its minimum value as the function of the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this remark follows from the obvious equivalence of ( [ hpl ] ) and ( [ 1h1 ] ) .",
    "we will later perform an additional variational analysis to demonstrate that the natural ansatz for @xmath65 based on the solution of ( [ hpl ] ) gives rise to qualitatively correct results .",
    "the hopping term moves the hole out of the dw deeply inside the domains .",
    "states obtained after the n - th hop of the hole contribute to the n+1-th state in the sequence @xmath51 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 which is created when the recurrence method is applied to analyze string - like excitations in the ladder - type stripe .",
    "states depicted in figs .",
    "[ str](d ) and ( e ) contribute to the vector @xmath68 which appears in the definition of the green s function ( [ rm ] ) .",
    "the contribution to the ising energy in the @xmath20 m from a state obtained by one hop of the hole into the domains from a rung occupied by a single fermion is higher if the spin direction of the rung fermion and the direction of the nearest spin in this domains are parallel , fig.[str](d ) .",
    "if these directions are antiparallel that contribution is lower because more bonds are occupied by antiparallel spins in the state created after a single hop of the hole , fig.[str](e ) .",
    "the hole which enters deeper into domains frustrates more af bonds and its energy increases , fig.[str](f)-(h ) .",
    "after the first hop the hole has several choices between different directions of the next move inside the domain .",
    "there are exactly @xmath69 possible directions of the next hop during which the hole does not return to the site occupied by it before the previous hop .",
    "@xmath70 is the coordination number .",
    "each next move may in general give rise to @xmath69 new states , examples of which have been depicted in figs.[str](f)-(h ) .",
    "the newly created states contribute to the next vector in the sequence @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 scalar products which appear in ( [ rm ] ) are given by , @xmath74 where @xmath53 . the formula ( [ nm2 ] ) is merely the normalization condition for the amplitudes @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the factor @xmath77 in ( [ nm ] ) represents the number of different paths along which the hole can move without retreats , while the factor @xmath78 appears there because the hopping term transforms the state @xmath79 into the state @xmath80 .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian for the @xmath20 m , between states @xmath81 representing holes , which have left the dw and have entered domains have their origin in the ising term in that hamiltonian and are given by , @xmath82 where @xmath83 . the formula ( [ metjz ] ) has been obtained by counting the number of frustrated af bonds .",
    "( [ metjz ] ) depends on the proportion between the weights @xmath84 and @xmath85 because the number of frustrated bonds is higher if the hole starts from a rung occupied by a fermion with spin parallel to the nearest spin in domains and is lower if these spins are antiparallel .",
    "the energy of the propagating quasiparticle in the ladder - like stripe , @xmath86 measured relative to the energy of the empty dw may be found within the recurrence procedure by looking for the lowest pole in ( [ rm ] ) .",
    "strings formed by defects which have been created by the moving hole may be shortened in the isotropic system by the transverse part of the heisenberg model which swaps antiparallel spins on nn sites .",
    "that process shifts effectively the hole or , to be more precise , the spin polaron to a second or a third nn site . as we have already mentioned , we mean by the spin polaron a state which is a combination of all string - like states created by the hopping hole which starts from a given site .",
    "we have also stressed that the propagating quasiparticle in the ladder - like stripe is the composition of the bonding fermion which moves inside the dw and the semicircular spin polaron .",
    "the latter characteristic manifests itself when the hole moves inside domains .",
    "processes which give rise to the propagation of the polaron in the isotropic af may bring about evaporation of holes from the single dw and it is likely that the single stripe is not stable in the doped isotropic af described by the @xmath9 m .",
    "when stripes form an array , holes can not escape to infinity .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the system of stripes will be additionally stabilized by tunneling of holes between them .",
    "the full quantitative analysis of the stripe system and tunneling phenomena is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we concentrate on energy changes related to the internal structure of the single stripe .",
    "we will argue that the energy scale of these changes is higher than the energy scale of hole propagation in domains and tunneling between stripes .",
    "thus it is sufficient to consider the motion along the single stripe to draw some conclusions about the stability of the whole stripe system .",
    "the motion of the hole inside the dw does not bring about any persistent changes in the spin structure , apart from some triplet excitations .",
    "it has been demonstrated that triplets play a minor role and may be neglected @xcite .",
    "thus , the longitudinal component of the quasiparticle propagating along the stripe resembles a moving free fermion .",
    "that component which is related to the motion in the ladder of the bonding state on a rung , is crucial for lowering the energy of the stripe relative to the energy of the doped homogeneous af . since the energy scale for the polaron propagation in the af is @xmath17 , while the energy scale for the propagation in the dw ( fig.[str](a ) ) of the bonding fermion is @xmath87 , in the lowest approximation we may neglect in the analysis of the stripe stability the processes which give rise to coherent propagation of polarons in the isotropic homogeneous af . on the other hand",
    ", we consider the motion inside domains of holes which start from a given rung in the dw , retrace their steps and return to the initial site .",
    "that motion brings about a considerable change in the energy of the quasiparticle propagating in the stripe relative to the energy of the bonding fermion propagating in the ladder .",
    "this change is of order @xmath87 .",
    "thus we treat the propagating quasiparticle in the ladder - like stripe as a composition which consists of the bonding rung fermions and of the confined semicircular spin polarons which are formed in af domains near the dw .",
    "the reduction of the distance between stripes may bring about an energy change which is also of order @xmath87 .",
    "namely , the length of strings is effectively limited by the width of domains .",
    "we will take into account in our calculation the effect which the domain width has on the energy .",
    "we have already mentioned that the translational invariance of the stripe in the direction parallel to its axis is broken by the af ordering of domains .",
    "thus the energy band formed by holes propagating in the stripe becomes split and the size of the 1d brillouin related to the motion along the stripe is effectively reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ strbds ] represents the lower part of this band .",
    "it can be filled twice by quasiparticles which are compositions of the spin polaron and of the bonding spin - up or spin - down fermion on a rung . a stripe obtained by filling the ladder - like",
    "dw with holes is different in this respect from the stripe obtained by filling with holes the narrow dw @xcite . the quasiparticle band which forms for the latter type of stripe is represented by the dash - dotted line in fig.[strbds ] .",
    "it can be filled only once because a spin - less holon is now the component of the quasiparticle propagating along the stripe @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of that band has been also found by means of the recurrence method .",
    "the energy is measured in both cases relative to the energy of the empty dw .",
    "irrespective that the bottom of the energy band for the stripe which is formed when the ladder - type dw is filled , lies higher than the bottom of the energy band for the stripe which is formed when the narrow dw is filled , filling the ladder - type dw with holes is a more effective way of lowering the energy for higher levels of doping because the quasiparticle band is flatter in this case and it can be filled twice .",
    "the dashed , doubly - dotted , straight line represents the energy of a hole confined in the anisotropic af described by the @xmath20 m .",
    "until now we have assumed that the amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 which define the state @xmath88 are solutions of the eigenstate equation ( [ hpl ] ) .",
    "it might be interesting to analyze if that natural choice , which is optimal in terms of lowering the matrix element ( [ 1h1 ] ) that describes motion of the hole inside the dw , provides a good approximation to the wave function of the hole propagating along the stripe .",
    "we will check how good is the initial choice of @xmath89 by varying the amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 and looking for the minimum of the lowest pole in ( [ rm ] ) considered as a function of these parameters under an additional condition that they are normalized according to the relation @xmath90 now , @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) represents the weights with which polarons pinned to odd ( even ) numbered rungs contribute to the quasiparticle .",
    "the weight @xmath84 may be different from @xmath85 because the contribution to the ising part of the energy in the @xmath20 m is lower if the hole enters the domain from a bond occupied by a fermion with spin antiparallel to the nearest spin in the domains .",
    "we have initially used fixed values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in agreement with the original scheme of the recurrence method in which the form of the initial state is fixed .",
    "now we combine the recurrence method with the variational approach in order to check the correctness of the initial ansatz for @xmath65 and the sensitivity of results to the change of the ansatz parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the dashed line in fig.[strbds ] represents @xmath86 obtained by optimizing the amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 . despite some differences between the dotted and dashed curves",
    "we may conclude that the initial ansatz ( [ ans ] ) for @xmath91 gives rise to the qualitatively correct description of the energy dispersion @xmath86 of the quasiparticle propagating in the ladder - like dw .",
    "the optimization of parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 lowers the energy of the propagating quasiparticle , but the change is not dramatic which indicates that even the original ansatz has been reasonable and the whole method is not very much sensitive to the change of details .",
    "it is worth to point out , that the combination of the recurrence approach with the optimization of the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 is still an approximation .",
    "states contributing to a given vector @xmath92 and related to strings of length @xmath93 , obtained by hopping of the hole which starts from even and odd rungs are created in the same step in the recurrence procedure .",
    "thus , the ratio between weights of strings with different lengths is the same for both kinds of strings independently of their length , which is not necessary optimal in terms of energy lowering .",
    "since the difference between ising energies of string states obtained by hopping of the hole which has started from an even or an odd rung does not change much with the length of strings that approximation definitely should not influence the final result in a qualitative way and thus it is acceptable .",
    "in this part of the paper we consider a different underlying spin structure of the bond - centered stripe . it is not clear what kind of bond order is energetically favorable when a ladder - like dw is filled with holes .",
    "an obvious optional magnetic structure is the spin - peierls order on legs .",
    "fig.[st2](a ) depicts that structure .",
    "we sketch now the calculation of the energy dispersion for the quasiparticle moving in such a spin background .",
    "the hopping of a hole along a rung gives rise to an exchange of positions between a single fermion and a singlet on parallel legs .",
    "the matrix element of the hopping term in the hamiltonian which couples the states depicted by fig.[st2](b ) and ( c ) or couples the states depicted by fig.[st2](d ) and ( e ) is @xmath18 .",
    "since that matrix element is positive , the lowest energy state with a given momentum along the stripe may be constructed by summing odd combinations of states , which are images obtained by reflection in the axis of the stripe .",
    "two examples of reflected states are shown in fig.[st2](b),(c ) , and in fig.[st2](d),(e ) . in a similar way as for stripes with the spin - peierls order on rungs we define @xmath94 as the normalized odd combination of states depicted by fig.[st2](b ) and by fig.[st2](c ) .",

    "we notice that the reduction of the difference between dw energies of the narrow dw , @xmath130 ( [ ehn ] ) and the ladder - like dw , @xmath128 in ( [ eh ] ) and ( [ eh2 ] ) may give rise to the stability of the ladder - like stripe at finite doping . as we have already shown that difference",

    "that it is not possible to find within our approach the exact value of the doping parameter at which the bond - centered stripes become more stable than site - centered stripes , it clear that spin fluctuations mediated by the transversal part of the heisenberg model stabilize a system of stripes which are formed by hole - filling of ladder - like dws with spin singlets on rungs or legs . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that a single stripe of that kind is not stable because holes which propagate in the isotropic af will easily evaporate from a single dw .",
    "a system of such stripes is stabilized by tunneling of holes or hole pairs between stripes .",
    "detailed analysis of such phenomena which seem to change the total energy to much lesser extend than hole kinetics along the stripe is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we expect that the energy change which is brought about by the propagation of the hole through domains does not influence in a decisive way the shape of a stable stripe system , because hole hopping through the homogeneous af background involves the exchange term which is proportional to @xmath156 .",
    "there seems to exist in a system of stripes a mechanism which may bring about a change of energy which is related to hopping and does not involve directly the exchange term . in a system of stripes",
    "the length of strings created by holes which hop in domains is to some extend limited by the width of these domains .",
    "this limitation influences the band renormalization which is brought about by intrusions into domains of the hole moving along the dw .",
    "neutron scattering experiments suggest that the width of af domains is 2 - 3 lattice spacings for the doping level @xmath0 .",
    "now , we are going to check how the energety of stripes is changed by the stripe - length limitation induced by the finite spacing between stripes .",
    "the same quantities as in fig.[stab2 ] have been depicted in fig.[stab3 ] .",
    "the only difference is that to derive energies presented in fig.[stab3 ] we have limited the length of strings to 3 lattice spacings . by the string length is meant here the number of hops needed to create a given string state from a state representing the single hole on a bond . by analyzing the construction of the sequence of states @xmath65 , @xmath157 by means of the recursion method applied to the stripe problem we easily infer that the state @xmath92 represents strings of length @xmath158 .",
    "thus , by stopping the recurrence procedure at the @xmath159-th step we may impose the restriction of the string length to @xmath160 lattice spacings .",
    "we notice that the effective radius reduction which takes place for semicircular quasilocalized polarons which are formed in domains brings about a shift of the lower limiting value of the doping parameter , for which the bond - centered stripe is stable , towards a lower level of linear filling .",
    "energy values depicted in fig.[stab4 ] have been obtained under a more restrictive assumption that the maximal value of string length is 2 lattice spacing .",
    "we conclude that the narrowing of domains is favorable for bond - centered , ladder - like stripes with the spin - peierls order on legs .",
    "we do not assume that nearest dws are impenetrable for a hole which has been created at a given dw .",
    "the hole may penetrate a nearest dw without rising the exchange energy only if at a certain stage of this process the transversal part of the heisenberg hamiltonian is applied to an intermediate state .",
    "the transversal term is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "we believe that omitting such a process does not change final conclusions which we draw from this calculation .",
    "the crucial question which needs to be answered , before the puzzle of high temperature superconductivity and a non - fermi liquid behavior observed in cuprates is solved , is how the mott insulating antiferromagnet is transformed , upon doping , into the unconventional metal and the superconductor .",
    "it is clear that properties of the doped af are determined by the competition between the kinetic energy , which favors formation of a metallic state with well defined itinerant quasiparticles , and the exchange interaction which favors magnetic or charge - ordered states that are insulators or poor conductors .",
    "a fully phase - separated state with one magnetically ordered hole - poor region is favorable in terms of lowering the exchange energy but not in terms of lowering the kinetic energy .",
    "a compromise between two seemingly opposite tendencies to localize moments and to form a broad quasiparticle band is reached by means of micro - phase separation which takes the form of the stripe phase .",
    "much effort has been made to develop theories of stripe states in doped afs @xcite .",
    "the experimental detection of stripes is far from being trivial .",
    "their shape has not been identified yet with full certainty",
    ". experimental evidence of micro - phase separation and its theoretical interpretation is not always unique @xcite .",
    "the width and the magnetic structure of stripes , defined as hole - rich regions which play the role of dws for magnetically ordered regions , belongs to issues that are still under debate .",
    "the concept of magnetically ordered states in doped afs , have been recently confronted with the idea of bond - ordered states .",
    "the classification presented in an article @xcite suggest that magnetic and paramagnetic orders are optional types of ordering , which do not coexist .",
    "a similar confrontation was already performed in an earlier paper @xcite in which energy changes upon doping in the columnar spin dimerized phase and the nel state have been compared . in some other articles @xcite the quantum critical point between the nel state and",
    "the columnar dimerized phase has been examined .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that in all these publications it was assumed that dimers in the columnar phase were covering the whole square lattice .",
    "we have presented in our paper a different point of view , according to which the coexistence of bond order with af order is possible due to micro - phase separation .",
    "the doped antiferromagnet favors the magnetic order with nonvanishing value of the sublattice magnetization in hole - poor parts of the system , while the bond order develops in hole - rich regions which take the form of unidirectional stripes separating af domains .",
    "the formation of the spin - peierls order in stripes which play the role of dws is favorable , because holes may propagate more freely in such a spin background and the kinetic energy is substantially lowered in this way . within the scenario of coexisting bond , af and charge orders we have considered a single dw between two af domains with opposite directions of the sublattice magnetization .",
    "this dw takes the form of the two - leg ladder with the spin - peierls order either on legs or on rungs .",
    "we have assumed that the motion of holes inside the dw is governed by a process during which a singlet on a bond and a single fermion on a neighbor bond exchange their positions .",
    "this location - exchange process is of first order because it is mediated by a single action of the hopping term .",
    "thus it lowers effectively the kinetic energy .",
    "we have also assumed that a strong tendency towards confinement manifests in the motion of a hole which has left a stripe ( a dw ) and has entered one of two af domains which are separated by the stripe .",
    "this quasiconfinement is related to the formation of so called strings or paths along which the hole has been hopping to a given site .",
    "the presence of strings which consist of defects in the af structure and which are created by the moving hole , gives rise to the energy increase .",
    "the tendency towards confinement may be attributed to this energy rise .",
    "holes , by following exactly the same path which they have taken to desert the stripe may return to it without leaving any defects in the magnetic structure of domains .",
    "the motion of the quasiparticle along the stripe may be viewed as position exchange of a bond fermion and of a bond singlet between nearest bonds .",
    "that motion is strongly renormalized by hole intrusions into af domains . after calculating the band energy of such a propagating complex quasiparticle",
    "we have deduced that the system of bond - centered , ladder - like stripes is energetically more stable than the system of site - centered stripes in the isotropic af at the linear hole - filling slightly below 0.5 .",
    "we have also taken into account in our analysis that the form of bond order in the ladder - like stripe , treated as a dw , strongly influences the value of the exchange energy .",
    "we have also argued that processes related to the coherent hole propagation in the af background and to the hole tunneling between stripes are of lower order and that they change the energy to lesser extent .",
    "there exists some experimental evidence , that the linear filling of stripes observed in cuprates is about 0.5 .",
    "since , in the results of our calculation , the limiting value of the linear filling parameter for which the bond centered stripe becomes more stable than the site centered stripe is not far away from that number , we may draw a general conclusion from our calculation , that the competition of different order types may influence properties of moderately doped cuprates .",
    "the outcome of our analysis also demonstrates that the system prefers formation of singlets on bonds parallel to stripe axes .",
    "such direction of bond order in stripes has also been observed in results of exact diagonalizations @xcite . from the comparison of figs.[stab2 ] , [ stab3 ] , and [ stab4 ] we may draw the conclusion that bond centered stripes are formed for higher levels of global doping at which the distance between stripes is shorter .",
    "the narrowing of af domains brings about the shortening of the average string length and the increase of weight for states representing holes inside dws .",
    "it seems that the motion of holes inside the bond centered stripe with the spin - peierls order is more effective in terms of lowering the energy than the motion of holes inside the site - centered stripe .",
    "the influence of this factor becomes more pronounced if distances between stripes are small .",
    "we have observed that quantum fluctuation reduce the energy difference between the bond - centered dw and the site - centered dw in the 2d af . since the limiting value of the linear filling parameter at which the bond - centered stripe becomes stable lies in fig.[stab4 ] below the number 0.5 which refers to the global doping level about @xmath0 and the width of af domains about 2 - 3 lattice spacings , we may deduce that the spin - peierls order is very likely for this and higher amount of doping .",
    "bond order has been already discussed in the context of stripes in some earlier papers . in one of these articles @xcite",
    "it has been demonstrated that the spin columnar dimerized phase is stable at a certain range of global doping .",
    "the author of this paper has suggested that such a state develops in cuprates as the stripe phase .",
    "it seems that it is desirable to consider some additional modulations of the spin structure than dimer columns in order to account for the doping - dependent spacing between stripes .",
    "magnetic excitations in the stripe phase have also been discussed in the literature .",
    "spin wave theory of these excitations , based on a scenario of site - centered stripes separating af domains @xcite does not capture the high energy part of the spectrum measured by means of neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "assuming spin dimerization and formation of bond centered stripes authors of two recent preprints have been able to formulate a theory which correctly describes the measured spectrum @xcite . on the other hand , they have assumed that hole - rich regions taking the form of two - leg ladders do not participate in spin dynamics , which is hard to justify because at the linear filling @xmath1 , 3 sites per 4 are occupied by spins in such structures .    according to our scenario",
    "the bond order dominates in hole - rich stripes which play the role of dws for hole - poor domains with more pronounced af correlations .",
    "it is energetically favorable for holes to fill stripes because there is no tendency to confine hole motion in two - leg ladder - like structures with the spin - peierls order .",
    "af correlations dominate in hole - poor regions which are effectively magnetically coupled via rungs occupied by a single fermion . if the spin direction of this fermion is antiparallel to the direction of spins lying in domains on both sides of the rung , by hopping forth and back along the rung , the fermion is able to lower the contribution to the exchange energy on both sides of the dw .",
    "a similar mechanism is known to operate in site - centered stripes @xcite .",
    "the two - leg ladder in the effective staggered magnetic field was already discussed , in the context of stripes , in some previous publications @xcite , but authors of these papers either did not consider bond order inside the ladder or did not consider the formation of strings in domains and hole intrusions into them .    the experimental identification of bond order in stripes and its shape is a difficult task .",
    "there is no direct method to achieve that goal .",
    "important information is provided by inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite . on the other hand results of theoretical",
    "analyzes @xcite seem to indicate that the shape of measured spectra is not very much sensitive to the form of the underlying bond order .",
    "thus , it seems that by means of neutron scattering measurements alone is it not possible to identify the exact form of the bond order which is formed in stripes .",
    "the interpretation of angle resolved photoemission experiments may be additionally helpful in this task , because the formation of a bond ordered state influences the electronic structure of any system @xcite .",
    "the single - particle spectral weight in the stripe phase was discussed in several theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the impact which the shape of hypothetical bond order in stripes , understood as hole - rich dws between af domains , may have on spectral properties of cuprates has not been yet thoroughfully analyzed .",
    "results of such an analysis performed by us confirm conclusions which we draw in this paper and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "much evidence has been accumulated that in some cases the charge and spin inhomogeneity observed in cuprates has purely 2d character @xcite .",
    "such modulations seem to be also consistent with the scenario of fluctuations between some bond ordered states @xcite .",
    "an analysis of this category of states is beyond the scope of the discussion presented in our paper .",

    "<S> motivated by recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments on cuprates , we discuss the formation of bond order in the stripe phase . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the spin peierls order emerges in hole - rich domain walls ( dws ) formed between hole - poor regions in which long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations exist . on the example of a single stripe we analyze the stability of such structures . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of a hole inside the dw which takes the form of a bond ordered ladder is in principle unrestricted . </S>",
    "<S> the hole hopping in domains is to some extent obscured by the fact that a moving hole spoils af correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation of a hole along the stripe which takes the form of the ladder - like domain wall that separates antiphase af domains is a combination of these two types of motion occurring in two different environments . by analyzing the energy dispersion of a quasiparticle propagating along the bond - centered , bond - ordered stripe and of a quasiparticle propagating along the site - centered stripe </S>",
    "<S> we deduce that bond ordered stripes are stable at the total doping level @xmath0 and the linear stripe - filling level @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion seems to be relevant to the nature of the stripe phase in @xmath2 . </S>"
