    "recently , an ultracold fermi gas has attracted much attention as a useful quantum simulator to study various many - body problems in strongly correlated fermi systems@xcite . using a tunable @xmath7-wave pairing interacting associated with a feshbach resonance",
    ", we can now study the @xmath7-wave fermi superfluid state from the weak - interacting bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ) regime to the strong - coupling bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) limit in a unified manner@xcite .",
    "in addition , the recent experimental progress on artificial gauge field technique@xcite has enabled us to introduce a spin - orbit interaction to a fermi gas , in spite of the fact that this is a neutral gas . in particular , since an antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction breaks the spatial inversion symmetry , the so - called parity - mixing effect has been discussed@xcite . as an interesting application of this unique phenomenon",
    ", the possibility of a @xmath8-wave superfluid fermi gas by using this effect has been proposed@xcite . in this regard , we briefly note that , while a tunable @xmath8-wave pairing interaction associated with a @xmath8-wave feshbach resonance has already been realized@xcite , the @xmath8-wave superfluid state has not been reported yet . since this unconventional pairing state has been realized in various fermi systems , such as liquid @xmath9he@xcite , as well as heavy - fermion superconductors@xcite , the realization of a @xmath8-wave superfluid fermi gas with a tunable interaction would contribute to the further development of unconventional superfluid physics .    besides the parity - mixing effect",
    ", it is also known that a spin - orbit interaction produces a two - body bound state even in the weak - coupling bcs regime ( where the ordinary contact - type @xmath7-wave pairing interaction never produces a bound state ) .",
    "this novel bound state is sometimes referred to as the rashbon in the literature , and it has also been pointed out that they enhance the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2 in the weak - coupling bcs regime , as in the case of the strong - coupling bec regime ( where the superfluid phase transition is dominated by tightly bound two - body states ) .",
    "thus , when we consider the phase diagram of a spin - orbit coupled fermi gas with respect to the strength of a @xmath7-wave pairing interaction and the strength of a spin - orbit interaction , it is an interesting problem to identify the region where the superfluid phase transition can be well described by the bec of rashbons .    in this paper , we investigate a spin - orbit coupled ultracold fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region at @xmath2 . to simplify our discussions",
    ", we treat the case of a spherical spin - orbit coupling , @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 are pauli matrices ) . within the framework of the bcs - bec crossover theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr)@xcite ,",
    "we determine @xmath2 , and an effective fermi chemical potential @xmath10 in a consistent manner . noting that the region with a negative fermi chemical potential at @xmath2 may be regarded as the bec regime",
    ", we divide the phase diagram of this system into the bcs regime and ( molecular ) bec regime .",
    "in addition , using that the rashbon mass is heavier than the mass of a cooper pair , we further divide the bec regime into the  rashbon - bec regime \" and the  ordinary bec regime \" where the superfluid phase transition is simply dominated by tightly bound cooper pairs .",
    "although there is actually no phase transition between , for example , bcs regime and rashbon - bec regime , this phase diagram would be helpful to grasp the overall behavior of a spin - orbit coupled fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region . throughout this paper , we set @xmath11 , and the system volume @xmath12 is taken to be unity , for simplicity .",

    "in addition , using the molecular mass , we also divided the former region into the rashbon - bec regime and the bec regime consisting of ordinary preformed cooper pairs . although these boundaries involve ambiguity because there is actually no phase transition there , the phase diagram obtained in this paper would be useful in studying how rashbons affect many - body properties of a spin - orbit coupled ultracold fermi gas .",
