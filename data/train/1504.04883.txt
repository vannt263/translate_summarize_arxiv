    "the fabry - perot ( fp ) interferometer provides a superb illustration of the mysterious ways in which interference works . despite its apparent simplicity",
    ", it plays a central role as high - resolution spectrometer , laser resonator , or spectral filter , to cite only but a few of its many relevant uses .",
    "a complete account of the subject can be found in the two comprehensive monographs by hernandez  @xcite and vaughan  @xcite .",
    "this variety of fields of application spawned many descriptions of the fp operation , each one capitalizing on specific aspects .",
    "the geometric treatment , in which one adds the multiple beams reflected at each of the different interfaces , is probably more instructive and , accordingly , is reproduced in almost every textbook  @xcite .",
    "the question can also be tackled by imposing the appropriate boundary conditions , which gives the resonant frequencies and allowed fields in the fp  @xcite .",
    "as the boundary conditions appear as a linear system , they can pop up under multiple guises : for example , the fp may be viewed as an optical transmission system with feedback  @xcite , or as a direct application of the transfer matrix  @xcite , a method especially germane to deal with layered structures .",
    "irrespective of the approach , the focus is always on the intensity distributions ( both in reflection and transmission ) ; namely , the well - known airy formulas .",
    "even if the corresponding amplitudes are somehow required to determine these distributions , they are ultimately discarded on the grounds that real experiments measure intensity .",
    "this viewpoint can be challenged , however , by a discussion of the conventional harmonic oscillator , wherein the complex amplitude is decomposed into two orthogonal in - phase and out - of - phase quadratures , also known as the dispersive and absorptive components  @xcite .",
    "these quadratures are of paramount importance as they convey more useful information than just the intensity . at the quantum level , for example",
    ", they play the role of the effective position and momentum of the oscillator  @xcite . actually , a good deal of the latest advances in quantum information processing stem from a proper engineering of these quadratures , with homodyne detection constituting an ideal tool for their measurement , whereas squeezing them provides an efficient route to producing entanglement  @xcite .    inspired by this",
    ", we intend to shed light on the amplitude response of the fp .",
    "indeed , one can define an equivalent version of the quadratures .",
    "when the parameters of the fp vary , the amplitudes trace out elementary curves : the reflected amplitude is a circle , and the transmitted one is a hippopede , a curve with remarkable properties  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fp performance can be naturally assigned to the geometrical features of these curves .",
    "apart from its elegance , this approach makes a close contact with phase - space methods that pervade physics today .",
    "the derivation is straight and easy ; suitable for undergraduates .",
    "surprisingly enough , to the best of our knowledge , such simple ideas have been not hitherto explored ; even if they can be important in some instances in which the phase introduced by the fp matters , as it happens in optical metrology , where the stabilization is crucial .",
    "the ideal fp interferometer consists of two parallel mirrors ( that , for simplicity , we assume to be identical ) separated at a distance @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : schema ] is a block diagram of the system .",
    "this can be addressed by considering a plane parallel plate of thickness @xmath0 and refractive index @xmath1 immersed in a medium of index @xmath2 .",
    "the plate is illuminated near normal incidence with a linearly polarized quasi - monochromatic plane wave , with the electric field lying either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of incidence . any diffraction effect or polarization dependence",
    "are thus neglected .    the complex reflection and transmission coefficients ( i.e.",
    ", the ratios of the reflected and the transmitted amplitudes to the incident one , respectively ) are given by  @xcite @xmath3}{1-r^2\\exp(-i2\\phi ) } \\ , ,      \\quad    t ( \\phi ) = \\frac{(1-r^2)\\exp(-i\\phi)}{1-r^2\\exp(-i2\\phi ) } \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 is the fresnel reflection coefficient for a wave travelling from the surrounding medium into the fp and @xmath5 is the plate phase thickness , with @xmath6 the wavelength in vacuum and @xmath7 the angle of refraction in the medium @xmath1 , which is related to the angle of incidence according to snell s law .    the usual analysis proceeds by calculating the reflectivity and transmissivity ( i.e. , the ratios of the reflected and the transmitted intensities to the incident one ) .",
    "the expressions are obtained directly from equation  ( [ eq : rtampfp ] ) and read @xmath8 where the parameter @xmath9 is @xmath10 although @xmath4 is up to now a real number , we formally treat it as a complex for reasons that will become apparent soon and so @xmath11 is the reflectivity of the plate surfaces .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : rtintfp ] ) constitute the time honored airy formulas . evidently , since there are no losses , the two patterns are complementary , in the sense that @xmath12    in figure  [ fig : tphif ] we plot the transmissivity @xmath13 as a function of the phase thickness @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as @xmath16 increases ,",
    "the minima of @xmath13 fall and the maxima become sharper . in the limit of high @xmath16 , the pattern consists on narrow bright fringes on an almost completely dark background .",
    "the sharpness of the fringes is conveniently measured by their full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , which is the width between the points on either side of a maximum where the intensity has fallen to half its maximum value .",
    "the ratio of the separation of adjacent fringes ( also called free spectral range ) and the fwhm is called the finesse @xmath17 of the fringes .",
    "a direct calculation shows that @xmath18 this quantity is a measure of the apparatus ability to resolve closely spaced spectral features .",
    "high values of @xmath17 require an increased reflectivity @xmath19 and this is accomplished by coating the plates surfaces with a mirror . in what follows",
    ", we assume that such a mirror is lossless . in that case , the airy formulas still hold provided we interpret @xmath4 as the reflection coefficient of the mirror ( which becomes now a complex number ) .",
    "this adds to the plate phase thickness @xmath14 a phase change on the reflection at the mirrors . in general ,",
    "both modulus and phase of the complex @xmath4 depend on the angle of incidence and the dispersion properties of the material , albeit such a variation can be disregarded for most practical purposes .",
    "let us look in more detail at the amplitudes ( [ eq : rtampfp ] ) .",
    "first of all , we observe that @xmath20 is a @xmath21-periodic function , while @xmath22 is @xmath23-periodic .",
    "such a difference can not be seen in the intensity response , for both @xmath24 and @xmath13 have the same period @xmath21 .    to proceed further ,",
    "let us rewrite equation  ( [ eq : rtampfp ] ) as @xmath25 \\",
    ", , \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\\\",
    "t   ( \\phi ) & = & \\frac{1- | r |^{2}}{i n(\\phi ) }     [ x ( \\phi ) - i y ( \\phi )   ] \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath26 we recall that any harmonic signal @xmath27 can be decomposed as @xmath28 where the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the in - phase and ( @xmath31 ) out - of - phase quadratures . in this spirit , @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be seen as sort of quadratures for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we stress , however , that at difference of the harmonic oscillator , here the pre - factors in their definition ( [ eq : quad ] ) are not constant , but depend on @xmath14 .",
    "this arises because the complex amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath35 do not have constant modulus , as in the oscillator .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rtphas ] we represent these complex amplitudes for several values of @xmath37 .",
    "the different behavior commented above in relation with the periodicity translates into the fact that when @xmath38 completes a revolution , @xmath34 makes two turns .",
    "both amplitudes lie inside the unit disk because of the fundamental constraint  ( [ eq : comrt ] ) .    to get a better grasp of these amplitudes , we introduce polar coordinates as @xmath39 with this parametrization ,",
    "we can recast equations  ( [ eq : quad ] ) as @xmath40 where we have used the definition in ( [ eq : rtintfp ] ) and @xmath41 is a real parameter @xmath42 so that @xmath43 .    in this way , the reflected amplitude @xmath36 can be immediately identified as a circle of radius @xmath41 centered in the point @xmath44 of the real axis .",
    "the transmitted amplitude @xmath45 describes a hippopede ( which literally means `` horse fetter '' ) .",
    "it was first investigated by proclus  @xcite and later on by booth  @xcite , hence their names are sometimes attached to this stunning curve .",
    "for @xmath46 it is an oval , and for @xmath47 it is an indented oval , which tends to be an eight in the limit @xmath48 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) . yet not so well known in physics , it has a truly amazing set of properties that the reader can look up in the abundant literature on the subject  @xcite .",
    "we merely quote that the hippopede can be defined as the curve formed by the intersection of a torus and a plane parallel to the axis of the torus and tangent to it on the interior circle .",
    "it is thus a spiric section  @xcite .    for every value of @xmath16 ,",
    "the reflected amplitude passes through the origin : @xmath50 is zero for @xmath51 and @xmath21 and traces the circle clockwise , getting its maximum at @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and then , according equation  ( [ eq : param ] ) , @xmath54 .",
    "on the other hand , the transmitted amplitude also describes the hippopede clockwise . at @xmath55 and @xmath21",
    ", @xmath35 reaches its maxima , which are in the real axis at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "therefore @xmath62 , which corresponds to half the waist of the hipoppede at its indentation .",
    "one can check that @xmath63 which , in turn , implies that for a transparent symmetric system , as the one we are dealing with , we have @xmath64 consequently , for every value of @xmath14 the reflected and transmitted amplitudes are at quadrature .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ortho ] , where we see that the position vectors of @xmath50 and @xmath22 are orthogonal , as it is somehow implicit in equation  ( [ eq : quad ] ) .",
    "apropos of this , it is noteworthy to mention that quite similar relations may be derived under the general assumptions of symmetric and lossless systems  @xcite .",
    "we next examine the local slopes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the dot denoting derivative respect to the parameter .",
    "they are the `` rates '' at which the curves are traced out .",
    "indeed , they entail a valuable physical interpretation .",
    "if we focus for simplicity at @xmath67 , we can write @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the angular frequency .",
    "now , @xmath70 is the single - pass time inside the cavity medium ( for a non - dispersive material , this is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the velocity of light in vacuum ) , and @xmath73 is the time flight through the fp , which incorporates the feedback .",
    "hence , @xmath74 may be viewed as an enhancement factor of the time flight due to the fp  @xcite .",
    "because of equation  ( [ eq : tau - rho ] ) , both are equal for a lossless medium : @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath76 where the negative sign indicates that the curve is oriented clockwise .",
    "this quotient is thus independent of @xmath14 : where the transmitted amplitude is large , so is the velocity and the opposite .    to gain further insight into this issue , in figure",
    "[ fig : vel ] we plot @xmath67 as a function of @xmath14 for several values of @xmath37 .",
    "note that the range of variation of @xmath67 is from @xmath77 to 0 when @xmath14 goes from 0 to @xmath78 , but @xmath79 ranges from @xmath80 to @xmath31 , as one can directly infer at a glance from figure  [ fig : ortho ] .",
    "when @xmath37 is small , @xmath67 is almost a straight line , with a slope pretty constant : this is the case when the hippopede is almost an oval , without indentation .",
    "however , as @xmath37 increases , @xmath67 starts bending near @xmath81 , which is precisely at the waist . in the limit @xmath82",
    ", @xmath67 becomes almost horizontal , with slope zero almost everywhere , except a narrow interval around the maxima of @xmath13 , where it quickly gets large .",
    "the previous considerations can be extended to a lossy ( or gain ) cavity medium , a case of particular interest in laser physics .",
    "the medium is now specified by a complex refractive index ( and so a complex @xmath14 ) , whose imaginary part accounts for the losses .",
    "the resulting trajectories , for the simple case of a plate of germanium , are shown in figure  [ fig : loxo ] and they turn out to be loxodromics  @xcite , a universal feature of absorption .",
    "they start at @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( when there is no film ) and tend to @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( when the film becomes opaque ) .",
    "we can appreciate that the orthogonality between position vectors does not hold true , neither the complementary relation equation  ( [ eq : comrt ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have thoroughly explored the amplitude response of an fp interferometer . despite its basic nature and its simplicity ,",
    "this topic has been snubbed in the literature , which has strengthened instead the role of the associated intensity .    given the relevant role played by the airy formulas",
    ", one might have expected that their `` square root '' counterparts should have remarkable features .",
    "this is indeed the case , as our results indicate : the reflected amplitude traces a circle , while the transmitted one is a hippopede , an intriguing curve full of nice mathematical properties .",
    "many of the ideas in this paper originated from a long cooperation with the late alberto g. barriuso , who unexpectedly passed away before being able to guide this work to completion .",
    "this paper is dedicated to his memory . over the years",
    ", these ideas have been further developed and expanded with questions , suggestions , criticism , and advice from many colleagues .",
    "particular thanks for help in various ways goes to g. bjrk , j. f. cariena , h. de guise , p. de la hoz , a. b. klimov , g. leuchs , and j. m. montesinos - amilibia .",
