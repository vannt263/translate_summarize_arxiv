    "three dimensional topological insulators ( ti ) have recently raised considerable interest in both theory@xcite and experiments@xcite for their nontrivial topological properties , which separate them from conventional band insulators .",
    "the hallmark of a ti is its exotic surface electronic properties . in particular",
    ", the strong topological insulator has an odd number of dirac nodes on the surface of the system , which are stable against moderate perturbations that preserve time reversal symmetry @xcite . such a band structure can not be realized in any two dimensional system with time reversal invariance .",
    "there have been experimental realizations of these predictions in bismuth antimony@xcite alloys and in bismuth selenium @xcite , which have been verified by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy . in two dimensions ,",
    "an analogous state is the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phase , which has counter - propagating one dimensional edge modes .",
    "such a state can occur with spin orbit interactions that preserve spin rotation symmetry about an axis , in which case the oppositely propagating modes carry opposite quantum numbers for this component of spin@xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite , that even in the absence of such spin rotation invariance , the counter - propagating modes remain protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "the three dimensional weak topological insulator ( wti ) can be obtained by stacking such 2d qsh states . however , in order to realize the strong topological insulator , the spin rotation symmetry must be completely broken .",
    "the ti and qsh phases normally exist in the systems with strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) that explicitly breaks spin rotation symmetry ( srs)@xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite an extended hubbard model on a 2d honeycomb lattice can have spontaneous srs breaking and result in a qsh phase , with the right kind of repulsive interactions@xcite .",
    "spin rotation symmetry is only preserved about an axis @xmath0 , which is spontaneously chosen , leading to gapless goldstone modes .",
    "this was termed a topological ` mott ' insulator - the separation of energy scales between the low lying magnetic excitations and the gapped charge excitations being typical of mott insulators .",
    "we will also adopt this nomenclature although it must be noted that local moment physics , often associated with mott insulators , does not occur here .",
    "subsequently , it was argued in @xcite that skyrmions of @xmath0 carry charge @xmath1 .    here , we consider the analogous problem of a three dimensional system without bare spin orbit couplings , and full spin rotation symmetry , being driven into a topological insulator state by strong interactions .",
    "the key difference from the two dimensional case , is that in order to realize the strong topological insulator , spin rotation symmetry must be completely broken .",
    "hence the order parameter in this case is a rotation matrix @xmath2 , similar to superfluid helium-3 a and b - phases , which leads to a richer set of topological textures .",
    "we describe a microscopic model , an extended hubbard model on the diamond lattice that , within a mean field treatment , leads to this phase .",
    "the order parameter supports a number of topological defects .",
    "in particular , a vortex like line defect occurs , but with a @xmath3 charge .",
    "this line defect in the _ strong _ ti is found to be associated with a pair of gapless fermionic excitations that travel along its length .",
    "these modes are topologically stable against moderate perturbations such as impurities and interactions as long as time reversal symmetry is intact .",
    "this is the main result of the paper - an analytical derivation is provided which relies on the properties of the dirac equation on a two dimensional curved surface .",
    "we now contrast our results with other recent work .",
    "similar exotic behavior also occurs in tis , along crystal defects such as dislocations .",
    "gapless fermionic excitations emerge there when a @xmath4 parameter formed by the product of the dislocation burgers vector and three weak topological insulator ( wti ) indices@xcite is nonzero - which in principle can occur in both the weak and strong ti .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper , the fermionic modes along the line defect are solely determined by the more elusive _",
    "strong _ index .",
    "they are absent in the case of the weak ti .",
    "thus far , the characterization of the ti phase has relied on the surface behavior .",
    "this result provides a route to identifying the strong topological mott insulator via a bulk property .",
    "similar modes have been identified propagating along a solenoid of @xmath5 flux , inserted into a strong topological insulator @xcite . here",
    ", the @xmath6 rotation of the electron spin around the line defect leads to a berry s phase , providing a physical realization of the @xmath5 flux .",
    "analogous phenomena occur in the context of line defects in superfluid he@xmath7-b@xcite .",
    "the order parameter @xmath8 admits a skyrmion like texture , which is a point object in three dimensions ( shankar monopole ) .",
    "we find that in contrast to the skyrmion of the quantum spin hall effect@xcite , these are uncharged .    in most solids where electron - electron interactions are important tend to have some degree of spin - orbit interactions - which will confine the defects .",
    "hence , we propose realizations of this physics in optical lattices of ultracold atoms , utilizing molecules with multipole moments to obtain the proposed extended hubbard models . the two dimensional version @xcite is found to be naturally realized with electric dipoles .",
    "realizing the three dimensional case is more challenging , however molecules with electric quadrupole moments confined in optical lattice can realize some of the key ingredients required .",
    "this paper is organized as the following : in the next section , we will present the order parameter manifold and the line modes @xmath4 dependence on the winding number ; in section iii , we will justify our claim with numerical and analytical results ; another texture shankar monopole will be discussed in section iv ; in section v , we will establish our model hamiltonian on a diamond lattice and show the mean field stability of topological mott insulating ( tmi ) phases ; we give two possible experimental realizations in cold atom systems in section vi ; we conclude the main result of this paper in the last section .",
    "hereafter we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the spin and sublattice degree of freedom , respectively .",
    "in order to describe the topological mott insulating phase , we consider a concrete example in the following . in a subsequent section ,",
    "we address the question of how such a phase may be microscopically realized . to contrast the tmi phase with the regular topological insulator , consider the model hamiltonians of a ti introduced in @xcite .",
    "we consider nearest neighbor hopping ( @xmath11 ) on the sites of a diamond lattice , and spin orbit induced hopping on next - neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 is the electron creation operator and @xmath14 is the spin pauli matrix .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction for a pair of second neighbor sites @xmath15 , depend on @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) the two nearest neighbor bond vectors connecting the second neighbor sites @xmath15 .",
    "the spin orbit interactions are thus determined by the crystal structure .",
    "note , the su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry is completely broken , which is required to realize the strong topological insulator in three dimensions .",
    "in contrast , in the tmi phase discussed here , the underlying hamiltonian possesses full su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry that is _ spontaneously _ broken .",
    "the order parameter @xmath8 then is a rotation matrix that describes the relative orientation between the real space coordinate system and the spin axes .",
    "the spin orbit term then takes the form :    @xmath18    there is one important difference between the ti and tmi : since in the latter @xmath8 arises from symmetry breaking it can vary spatially to give rise to a topologically nontrivial texture . to identify the topologically stable defects , we first note that the order parameter manifold is a three dimensional orthogonal matrix @xmath19 .",
    "it can represent by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are orthogonal unit vectors representing the basis vectors of the spin coordinate system .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f03 ] .     of a nontrivial line defect in the @xmath22 plane ,",
    "@xmath23 direction is translation - invariant .",
    "the hollow and solid arrow are the @xmath24 and @xmath25 axes of local coordinate , the @xmath23 axis points out of the paper for proper rotation . ]",
    "the target manifold of this order parameter is @xmath26 , and @xmath4 determines the chirality @xmath27 , or whether the rotation is proper or improper .",
    "hereafter we mainly focus on the continuous @xmath28 part of the order parameter , for it has nontrivial homotopy groups in two and three dimensions .",
    "then , each proper rotation can be described by the parameters @xmath29 , where @xmath0 is the direction of the rotation axis and @xmath30 $ ] is the rotation angle around it . to visualize it",
    "we can map all proper rotation matrices to a solid ball with radius @xmath5 , where @xmath31 maps to the radial direction and rotation angle maps to the radius of the image point .",
    "note a rotation of @xmath5 about @xmath31 is the same as that of @xmath5 about @xmath32 , so opposite points on the spherical surface are identified .",
    "the resulting geometry is a three dimensional projective plane @xmath33@xcite .",
    "we now discuss the topological defects of this order parameter space . the discrete @xmath3 symmetry breaking implied by the @xmath34 order parameter leads to domain walls in three dimensions .",
    "more interestingly , line defects also exist ( we assume three spatial dimensions in the following ) .",
    "these can be captured by considering the order parameter along a closed curve in real space , which encircles the line defect .",
    "this defines a closed loop in the order parameter space and distinct classes of such closed loops correspond to the topological line defects .",
    "there are two classes of closed loops for the @xmath35 space described above .",
    "in addition to the trivial closed loop , that can be shrunk continuously to a point , there exists a nontrivial loop that connects the antipodal points @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "since these represent the same rotation , this is in fact a closed loop .",
    "thus there is a nontrivial line defect characterized just by a @xmath3 topological charge .",
    "technically @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f03 ] with translational invariance along @xmath39 direction although generically , the line can be of arbitrary shape and direction .",
    "the electronic properties of such a line defect is studied in the following section - protected one dimensional modes that propagate along the defect are found in the case of the strong tmi , but not in the case of the weak tmi .",
    "we also note that since @xmath40 , no nontrivial point defects exist in three dimensions . however , since @xmath41 , ` skyrmion ' like textures ( called shankar monopoles @xcite ) exist in three dimensions .",
    "in contrast to topological defects , they are smooth textures without a singular core . we investigate the electronic structure of these objects and find that they are neutral in the large size limit , in contrast to skyrmions in the two dimensional quantum spin hall state which carry charge @xmath1@xcite .",
    "we study the electronic structure of the @xmath3 line defect in the diamond lattice model of a topological mott insulator discussed before . we choose the nearest neighbor hopping in three directions to be equal @xmath42 while the fourth is different @xmath43 . a strong ( weak )",
    "ti phase occurs if @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "we choose an order parameter texture that incorporates line defects :    @xmath46    with @xmath47 + where @xmath48 depends only on the azimuthal angle of the atom connecting sites @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "note , only the parity of @xmath51 is topologically stable .",
    "here we study a system of @xmath52 with a maximally separated vortex ( @xmath53 ) and anti - vortex ( @xmath54 ) , and with periodic boundary condition in @xmath55 plane and translational invariance in @xmath39 direction .",
    "note , time reversal symmetry is preserved by this hamiltonian .    for a @xmath56 strong tmi system with @xmath57 ,",
    "two pairs of conducting line modes are found in the bulk gap .",
    "these states density profiles are strongly localized at the cores or the two defects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f04 ] top , shows only one of them for clarity ) .",
    "therefore a kramer pair of modes is localized along the thread of core .",
    "given the particle hole symmetry that happens to be present in this model , they cross at zero energy ( fig .  [",
    "fig : f04 ] bottom ) .",
    "in contrast , these modes are _ absent _ in the cases of the weak tmi @xmath58 or if @xmath59 in either type of tmi , and the bandstructure remains fully gapped .",

    "we can derive these modes based on the 3d dirac continuum limit of the hamiltonian ( [ h_meanfield ] ) ; however , below we consider deriving these modes using the known properties of surface states of strong topological insulators . consider a bulk sample with a infinitely long cylindrical hole of radius @xmath66 drilled through its center .",
    "we consider the low energy states on the cylindrical surface , both without and with a line defect inserted in the cylindrical hole fig .",
    "[ fig : f06 ] .",
    "we show that in the limit of @xmath67 , a propagating midgap mode survives only when the defect is present ; otherwise a fully gapped insulator results .",
    "interestingly , the key ingredient here is the property of the two dimensional surface dirac state , on a curved manifold .",
    "in contrast to the states of a particle on a ring , where the zero angular momentum eigenstate remains at low energy even when the ring radius is shrunk to zero , here , the dirac particle acquires a berry s phase of @xmath5 on rotating around the cylinder surface , which excludes the zero angular momentum state . hence on shrinking the radius ,",
    "no low energy states remain , and the bulk insulator is recovered . however , if a topological defect of the spin - orbit coupling matrix is inserted through the cylinder , an additional berry s phase of @xmath5 is now acquired by the electrons .",
    "this ultimately results from the rotation of the electron s spin by @xmath6 , on following the texture . with this additional phase",
    ", the zero angular momentum mode is allowed , and a low energy propagating mode results when the cylinder radius is shrunk to zero .",
    "these are the topologically protected one dimensional modes in the core of the defect .",
    "note , since we are establishing the presence of a topologically protected excitations , it is sufficient to use a simple dirac dispersion for the surface states of the strong topological insulator , since a general surface state can always be adiabatically mapped to it .",

    "there should be additional terms due to the curvature .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be systematically derived @xcite , as described in the appendix .",

    "the energy eigenvalues are then given by eqn.[en ] .",

    "the physical picture is : on the surface of a cylinder the momentum @xmath110 is quantized according to boundary condition and the inter - level spacing is proportional to @xmath113 . also , because of the spin - momentum relation , when electron circles about the line defect it picks up a berry phase of @xmath114 when the vortex winding number is @xmath51 .",
    "when the total phase is an integer multiple of @xmath6 it enforces periodic boundary condition , otherwise anti - periodic boundary condition is applied and the quantized @xmath110 will miss the origin .",
    "as we shrink the cylinder radius to zero , all quantized @xmath110 will diverge except @xmath115 . therefore , with time reversal symmetry a kramers pair of line modes exist",
    "when @xmath51 is odd and its dispersion only depends on @xmath62 .",
    "also , the distinction between the strong tmi and weak tmi can be made clear by the number of surface modes . for a weak tmi ,",
    "there are an even number of surface modes , leading to an even number pairs of line modes with the above reasoning .",
    "however , they are unstable against inter - node scattering . in contrast",
    ", a strong tmi always has an odd number pairs of surface modes .",
    "the line vortex is not the only nontrivial texture in 3d .",
    "the other texture we study is the shankar monopole , a mapping @xmath116 characterized by the homotopy classification @xmath41 @xcite .",

    "the homotopy class @xmath130 is described by integer @xmath51 , suggesting the base manifold wraps the target manifold @xmath51 times .",
    "it is protected against any continuous deformation .",
    "this is a zero dimensional defect so the localized states should be localized charge at the monopole , if any .    however , numerical results show this topological defect does not carry localized states even in the strong tmi phase .",
    "we studied a single monopole at the center of a @xmath131 unit cell system . to treat the large system size we found a way to sidestep a complete diagonalization of the spectrum .",
    "instead , we estimate the boundaries of the energy eigenstates using arpack ( arnoldi package ) , and shift the spectrum so that all states below ( above ) the band gap are at negative ( positive ) energies . then",
    ", we only need to look at the difference in the number of negative and positive energy eigenvalues , to determine the monopole charge .",
    "this can be done via an efficient @xmath132 factorization , where the hamiltonian is factorized into a lower triangular matrix @xmath133 and a diagonal matrix @xmath134 .",
    "the entries of the diagonal matrix preserves the sign of the eigenvalues , but not their magnitude . counting the number of positive and negative eigenvalues is then readily accomplished .",
    "while smaller system sizes sometimes show charged monopoles , at the largest sizes , they are found to be neutral .",
    "we conclude that the shankar monopole texture does not carry charge in the tmi phase .",
    "we now discuss the question of realizing the 3d tmi phase beginning with a microscopic model with full spin rotation symmetry .",
    "we consider an extended hubbard model on the diamond lattice within mean field theory .",
    "as always , the results of such a mean field treatment should be treated with caution especially since strong interactions are involved .",
    "nevertheless , we use this analytically tractable approach to obtain a range of parameters where the tmi phase is stabilized over the other obvious candidate phases - the disordered semi - metal , antiferromagnetic insulator ( or spin density wave : sdw ) and the charge density wave ( cdw ) . realizing the 3d tmi which completely breaks spin rotation symmetry spontaneously , requires , in mean field theory , further neighbor repulsion ( between second than third nearest neighbors ) as well as a small antiferromagnetic coupling between second neighbors , as shown in fig .",

    "they are both between the atoms of the same sublattice . ]    without repulsive interaction the system is in a semi - metal phase with gapless excitations along lines in the brillouin zone ( ` dirac lines ' ) and a vanishing dos at the fermi level .",
    "we turn on interactions and investigate possible phases including the topological mott insulator , second and third nearest neighbor charge density wave ( cdw ) insulators , and nearest - neighbor spin density wave(sdw ) insulator .",
    "note , the diamond lattice is composed of a fcc bravais lattice , plus a two site basis that forms the two sublattices .",

    "this is not a tmi phase in the strict sense , since there are dirac nodes at the fermi level .",
    "however , an arbitrarily small distortion of the lattice will introduce anisotropy of nearest neighbor hopping strengths @xmath184 and an effective mass that leads to a gap of size @xmath185@xcite . in the simplest case that one nearest neighbor hopping strength is different from the other three @xmath186 ,",

    "this tmi phase has second nearest neighbor correlation similar to that arising from spin orbit interactions in the fu - kane - mele model on the same lattice , except , of course for an arbitrary su(2 ) spin rotation @xcite , @xmath191 for each second nearest neighbor pair @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath192 and @xmath193 are nearest neighbor bond vectors connecting this pair of sites , and @xmath8 is an arbitrary constant three dimensional rotation matrix .",

    "the system size is @xmath194 for calculation . ]",
    "an experimental realization of the tmi phase must contend with two challenges .",
    "first , the system should have weak intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , but strong interactions .",
    "next , the further neighbour repulsion should be substantial compared to the nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we believe these difficulties can be overcome in cold atom system , where intrinsic spin orbit couplings are irrelevant , if particles with electric multipole moments are confined to optical lattice sites .",
    "we first discuss a two dimensional example involving electric dipoles , for which a fairly definite experimental setup can be constructed .",
    "although the phase realized here is two dimensional and does not break spin rotation symmetry completely ( a u(1 ) spin rotation remains unbroken ) , it illustrates how the necessary ingredients can be assembled .",
    "subsequently we discuss ideas for realizing the three dimensional tmi , the main subject of this paper , using electric quadrupole moments .    _",
    "2d case : electric dipoles on a diamond lattice layer _ dipole - dipole interactions between hetero - nuclear polar molecules , such as rb@xmath195 and k@xmath196 have already been shown to be strong @xcite . consider a fermionic spin 1/2 molecule , with an electric dipole moment ( which is independent of the spin ) confined to the sites of an optical lattice .",
    "we note here that the diamond lattice has a special property that if the dipole - moment is along the [ 100 ] directions , then the nearest neighbor interaction @xmath197 _",
    "vanishes_. thus , the second nearest neighbor interaction @xmath149 becomes dominant .",
    "however , the difficulty is that within the twelve second nearest neighbors , only interactions between neighbors within a plane perpendicular to the dipole moment are repulsive .",
    "this problem can be solved if we restrict the molecules within a two dimensional ( 111 ) layer of the diamond lattice ( still contain both sublattices and essentially two layers of triangular lattices ) , as the sites circled in fig .",
    "[ fig : f01 ] .",
    "then if the dipole moment is perpendicular to the plane all possible nearest neighbor interactions are repulsive .",
    "we solve for the mean field phase diagram of this model , as was done previously for the 3d case .",
    "note , since the lattice is essentially the honeycomb lattice , this is essentially the model studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "there exists a 2d - tmi phase at the center of the @xmath198 phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f05 ] ) . note this phase diagram differs from the same model in ref.@xcite which has an extended 2d - tmi phase .",
    "this is because we also allow for the second nearest neighbor cdw that the authors neglected .",
    "though frustrated , this order will dominate at large @xmath149 .",
    "the resulting tmi phase in our case has a second nearest neighbor correlation resembling that of a quantum spin hall state and su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry is only broken down to u(1 ) .",
    "the resulting order parameter will be @xmath199 instead of @xmath147 . since @xmath200",
    "there are no point topological defects - however skyrmions acquire a charge @xmath1 in this phase .",
    "note , the parameters in the phase diagram seem rather accessible for dipolar molecular systems in this setup , assuming that the onsite @xmath141 , which results from a combination of dipolar and microscopic interactions , is not too large .",
    "the system size is @xmath194 for calculation . ]",
    "_ 3d tmi : electric quadrupoles on a distorted diamond lattice .",
    "_ we now discuss some ideas for realizing the 3d tmi . while these are not as straightforward as the ones discussed earlier , we nevertheless offer them as one avenue that presents itself at the current time .",
    "another possible origin of repulsive interaction is the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "one can show that for two parallel uniaxial quadrupoles ( quadrupole tensors are identical and diagonal ) , the interaction is@xmath201 where @xmath202 is the electric quadrupole moment , r is the distance between two quadrupoles and @xmath70 is the angle between the quadrupole symmetry axis and the direction between the quadrupoles .    from this expression if @xmath203 the quadrupole -quadrupole interaction will vanish .",
    "therefore , assume the quadrupole moment is along the crystal unit cell @xmath23 axis to retain as many symmetries as possible , if we elongate the lattice along one direction to make the nearest neighbor satisfy this condition , we will obtain a system where second nearest neighbor interaction dominates .",
    "this gives @xmath204 .",
    "note the distortion brings no change to the hamiltonian we started with . within this lattice , the ratio between the repulsive interaction from the second nearest neighbor out of the quadrupole perpendicular plane and that from those in plane is @xmath205 .",
    "the @xmath149 anisotropy is reasonably small , thus we believe the physics we discussed with an isotropic @xmath149 is unchanged .",
    "however , in this arrangement , @xmath206 is rather small .    to give an reasonable estimate of the quadrupole strength necessary to drive the system into a tmi phase , we notice the typical nearest neighbor hopping strength in an cold atom system is of order @xmath207 limited by the cooling temperature and the typical lattice dimension is about the laser wavelength @xmath208",
    "this leads to a quadrupole of @xmath209 , @xmath210 is unit charge .",
    "this is rather large but maybe realizable in multi - electron molecules .",
    "also , the critical quadrupole moment can be further reduced by lowering the temperature or using lasers with shorter wavelength . finally ,",
    "a moderate second nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling may result from second nearest neighbor hopping super - exchange effect .",
    "we leave for future work construction of a more realistic setting that can realize the 3d tmi phase .",
    "we have argued that appropriate repulsive interactions can induce a spontaneous spin rotation symmetry breaking state , the topological mott insulator , where spin orbit couplings are induced by interactions .",
    "in addition to exotic surface states , line defects of the order parameter are found to carry protected one dimensional modes along their length in the strong tmi , which provides a bulk signature of this phase . also , potential experimental directions towards creating these phases in cold atom system are discussed .",
    "an interesting open question is whether the form of the spin - orbit interactions near a line defect , and hence these protected line modes , can be realized by suitably modifying the atomic structure in a strong topological band insulator .",
    "we thank t. senthil , ari turner and d. h. lee for discussions , and acknowledge support from nsf dmr-0645691 .",
    "it is known that the effective hamiltonian for a ti surface has the form of a dirac equation : @xmath74 when the spin and momentum are parallel and @xmath211 when they are perpendicular , where @xmath0 is the normal direction of the surface .",
    "both the momentum and spin are confined to the surface . more generally , when the angle between spin and momentum is @xmath70 the effective hamiltonian is:@xmath212      one would tends to apply the same hamiltonian to a curved surface .",
    "however , here we claim the effective hamiltonian on an arbitrary shaped ti surface is:@xmath215 where @xmath213 and @xmath214 are tangent vectors of the surface with radius of curvature @xmath216 and @xmath217 , respectively , and @xmath218 is the normal vectors .",
    "@xmath70 is the constant angle between spin and momentum in the corresponding flat surface effective theory .",
    "note when the surface is flat , the last two terms vanish and the hamiltonian goes back to the one describing the flat surface mode .",
    "this hamiltonian can be systematically derived from the inclusion of the connection form for a curved space@xcite , but an alternative method we used is to ensure hermiticity and anticommutation relation @xmath219 since the spin is in the surface plane@xcite , with the help of the relations : @xmath220 , @xmath221 for @xmath78 , and @xmath222 .
