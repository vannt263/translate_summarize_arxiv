    "ever since the definition of seyfert galaxies ( seyfert 1943 ) and the first recognition of quasars ( schmidt 1963 ) , astronomers have put enormous effort into compiling large samples of active galactic nuclei ( agn , in this paper , `` agn '' refers to active galactic nuclei at all luminosities , including quasars ) and trying to understand the physics that powers them .",
    "this is not easy , since luminous agn comprise only a few percent of normal galaxies .",
    "based on the distinctive characteristics of agn , different methods have been developed to search for agn in various wavebands .    in the optical ,",
    "agn show different colors from stars and normal galaxies , especially at high luminosity .",
    "many surveys have used color selection ( schmidt & green 1983 ; boyle 1990 ) . in particular",
    ", the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( york 2000 ) uses optical colors to identify quasar candidates , which are then observed spectroscopically ( richards 2002 ) .",
    "the color selection is very efficient but it requires that the optical luminosity of an agn be at least comparable to the luminosity of its host galaxy for the color to be distinctive , and thus the color selection systematically misses less luminous agn at low redshift .",
    "agn also show strong optical and ultraviolet emission lines . broadly speaking",
    ", agn can be classified into two types : broad - line and narrow - line agn . the former show broad permitted emission lines , with full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of several thousand km s@xmath1 , while in narrow - line agn , both the permitted and forbidden emission lines are narrow , with fwhms @xmath2 500 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is comparable with emission lines in normal star - forming galaxies , but emission lines in narrow - line agn have considerably greater ionization range . in particular , both high - ionization lines such as [ neiii]@xmath3 , [ ne v]@xmath4 and [ oiii]@xmath5 , and low - ionization lines such as [ oi]@xmath6 and [ ni]@xmath7 , are stronger in narrow - line agn than in normal starforming galaxies .",
    "based on this feature , narrow - line agn can be identified by their distinctive emission line ratios .",
    "the first line ratio diagram was introduced by baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1982 ) , who suggested that agn generically have greater [ oiii]@xmath5/h@xmath8 ( the flux ratio of [ oiii]@xmath95007 to h@xmath8 ) than do galaxies whose emission lines are due to stellar processes .",
    "veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) developed their idea and used diagnostic diagrams that consist of combinations of four line ratios : [ oiii]@xmath95007/h@xmath8 , [ nii]@xmath10/h@xmath0 , [ oi]@xmath11/h@xmath0 and [ sii]@xmath12/h@xmath0 , and further developed a semi - empirical line on the diagrams to separate agn and starburst galaxies .",
    "the emission - line pairs are chosen specifically so that the two lines in a ratio are at nearly identical wavelengths , therefore reddening and spectrophotometric uncertainties are not big effects .",
    "these diagnostic diagrams have been used ever since as a standard to identify narrow - line agn .",
    "kewley ( 2001 ) developed a set of theoretical separation lines for agn and starforming galaxies on the diagnostic diagrams . by constructing a detailed continuous starburst model with large realistic metallicity and",
    "ionization parameter ranges , they found that the model folds on the diagnostic diagrams and there exist upper limits for starforming galaxies .",
    "these upper limits can be used to separate agn and starforming galaxies and they can be fitted to a simple rectangular hyperbolic shape : @xmath13}\\lambda 5007}{\\mathrm{h\\beta}}\\right ) = \\frac{0.61}{\\log(\\mathrm{[nii]/h\\alpha})-0.47}+1.19 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\log\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{[oiii]}\\lambda 5007}{\\mathrm{h\\beta}}\\right ) = \\frac{0.72}{\\log(\\mathrm{[sii]/h\\alpha})-0.32}+1.30 \\\\   \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{[oiii]}\\lambda 5007}{\\mathrm{h\\beta}}\\right ) = \\frac{0.73}{\\log(\\mathrm{[oi]/h\\alpha})+0.59}+1.33 \\nonumber \\label{eq : kewleyline}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these theoretical separation lines between agn and starforming galaxies are widely accepted to use to identify narrow - line agn in the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "kauffmann ( 2003a ) , on the other hand , when studying host galaxy properties of narrow - line agn in the sdss , proposed an empirical and more lenient cut to identify agn : @xmath14}\\lambda 5007}{\\mathrm{h\\beta}}\\right )   \\ge \\frac{0.61}{\\log(\\mathrm{[nii]/h\\alpha})-0.05}+1.3 \\label{eq : kauff}\\ ] ] this criterion will select many more galaxies as agn than kewley s criteria . in this paper , we apply both criteria and discuss their differences in detail .",
    "there are several spectroscopic galaxy surveys from which people have tried to select agn based on their emission lines .",
    "one is the cfa redshift survey ( davis , huchra & latham 1983 ; huchra 1983 ) .",
    "spectra of about 2,400 galaxies were taken to study their large scale distribution .",
    "huchra , wyatt & davis ( 1982 ) used these spectra to select agn by identifying emission lines indicative of nonstellar activity . as a result they found roughly 50 seyfert galaxies , divided approximately equally between seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies , making the local seyfert fraction @xmath15 ( huchra & burg 1992 ) .",
    "another example is the revised shapley - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage & tammann 1981 ) . among its @xmath21,300 galaxies ,",
    "about 50 are seyfert galaxies of luminosity comparable to those found in the cfa survey . ho",
    "( 1997a ) took uniform high signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra of 486 galaxies using very small apertures centered on the nuclei .",
    "418 galaxies were found to contain emission - line nuclei , of which 206 are star - forming , and 211 show agn activity .",
    "this demonstrates that low - luminosity agn activity in the local universe is extremely common , as first discussed by phillips , charles , & baldwin ( 1983 ) .",
    "hall ( 2000 ) systematically selected high redshift agn based either on their broad emission lines or narrow [ nev ] emission lines from the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ; yee 2000 ) .",
    "they found 47 confirmed and 14 candidate agn in the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "the sdss has opened a new window to the study of agn by providing a huge number of high quality spectra of galaxies .",
    "there have been several studies identifying agn spectroscopically from different subsamples of sdss galaxies ( kauffmann 2003a ; miller 2003 ) .",
    "both studies have focused on narrow - line agn identified from the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "miller ( 2003 ) found agn signatures in at least 20% of 4,921 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath17 , and studied the environment of these agn .",
    "kauffmann ( 2003a ) selected 22,623 narrow - line agn from a parent sample of 122,808 galaxies and studied their host galaxy properties . the agn detection rate , however , depends very much on the agn selection criteria used and many other details in defining the sample . in this paper",
    ", we apply a systematic search for both broad and narrow - line agn in a well - defined sky area in the redshift range @xmath18 .",
    "the framework of our narrow - line agn selection is similar to kauffmann ( 2003a ) , but we differ in many details .    in section 2 , we give a brief overview of the sdss , focusing on those aspects most relevant to our study .",
    "@xmath19 introduces the parent sample from which we will select our agn . in @xmath20 , we will discuss the subtraction of stellar absorption lines from the spectra .",
    "the emission line measurements are discussed in @xmath21 . in @xmath22 ,",
    "the selected agn are presented and discussed .",
    "@xmath23 gives a clean agn sample and we summarize in @xmath24 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( york 2000 ) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover approximately one - quarter of the celestial sphere and collect spectra of @xmath25 galaxies and @xmath26 quasars .",
    "it uses a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apache point , new mexico , with a @xmath27 degree field , and a mosaic ccd camera and two fiber - fed double spectrographs to carry out the imaging and spectroscopic surveys respectively .",
    "a separate 20@xmath28 photometric telescope is used for photometric calibration ( smith 2002 ; hogg 2001 ) .",
    "the imaging camera ( gunn 1998 ) consists of a mosaic of 30 imaging ccds with @xmath29 pixels subtending 0.396@xmath28 on the sky .",
    "the sky is observed through five broad - band filters @xmath30 ( fukugita 1996 ; stoughton 2002 ) covering the entire optical band from the atmospheric cutoff in the blue to the sensitivity limit of silicon ccds in the red .",
    "the imaging is done in drift - scan mode and the total integration time per filter is 54.1s .",
    "the 50% completeness limits for point sources are 22.5 , 23.2 , 22.6 , 21.9 and 20.8 magnitudes respectively and the photometric calibration is reproducible to 3% , 2% , 2% , 2% and 3% for the five bandpasses , respectively .",
    "the image data are processed by a series of automated pipelines ( lupton 2001 ; stoughton 2002 ; pier 2003 ) , which make various measurements of the flux of each detected object",
    ".    the sdss is obtaining spectra of complete samples of three categories of objects : galaxies , luminous red galaxies and quasars .",
    "these spectroscopic targets are selected from the imaging data via various target selection criteria .",
    "galaxy target selection is discussed in strauss ( 2002 ) .",
    "briefly speaking , galaxies are separated from stars by morphology .",
    "the magnitude limit cut for the galaxy sample was changed several times during commissioning , but is currently @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the @xmath32 band petrosian magnitude .",
    "all magnitudes are corrected for extinction following schlegel ( 1998 ) .",
    "these objects are the sample from which we will select agn .",
    "quasar target selection ( richards 2002 ) is based on the nonstellar colors of quasars and matching unresolved sources to the first radio catalog .",
    "luminous red galaxies are selected ( eisenstein 2001 ) by a variant of the photometric redshift method , aiming to have a uniform , approximately volume - limited sample of highly luminous objects with the reddest colors in the rest frame to @xmath33 . in this paper , we will not discuss agn selected from these two samples , unless they also satisfy the galaxy sample magnitude cut @xmath31 .",
    "the sdss spectra are taken with two fiber - fed spectrographs , covering the wavelength range 3800 - 9200 @xmath34 over 4098 pixels .",
    "each plate can hold 640 fibers , with a fixed aperture of 3@xmath28 .",
    "the plates are positioned by a tiling algorithm ( blanton 2003 ) and fibers are assigned to targets .",
    "galaxies are among the tiled targets that have the highest priority of having their spectra taken .",
    "the finite diameter of the fiber cladding prevents fibers on any given plate from being placed closer than 55@xmath28 apart .",
    "the resolution @xmath35 varies between 1850 and 2200 .",
    "the relative spectrophotometry is accurate to about 20% .",
    "each spectrum is accompanied by an estimated error per pixel , based on photon statistics and the amplitude of sky residuals .",
    "the typical s / n for galaxy spectra at the sample limit is 16/pixel .",
    "the spectroscopic data are reduced through the spectroscopic pipelines , spectro2d and specbs .",
    "spectro2d reduces the 2-dimensional spectrograms produced by the spectrographs to flux- and wavelength - calibrated spectra .",
    "specbs is different from the sdss official pipeline , it determines classifications and redshifts via a @xmath36 fit to the spectrum in question with a series of rest - frame star , galaxy and quasar templates .",
    "the basic technique is described by glazebrook ( 1998 ) and bromley ( 1998 ) .",
    "even though specbs has made measurements on emission lines by fitting a single gaussian at positions of each expected emission line , we carry out our own fits in our study .",
    "the main reason is that a single gaussian fit is not adequate to model some agn having both broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "the emission lines are measured directly from calibrated spectra , as we describe in detail in @xmath37 .",
    "in order to do statistical studies of agn , it makes sense to start with a complete sample of objects within a certain well defined area from the sdss .",
    "we start from 129,625 target objects complete in 1151 square degrees .",
    "this is about 1/2 of the spectra available in the sdss second data release ( abazajian 2004 ) . among these objects ,",
    "there are 98,684 galaxies targeted by the main galaxy target algorithm ( strauss 2002 ; @xmath38 ) and 17,972 quasar target objects ( richards 2002 ; @xmath38 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the galaxy target objects . however , there are 2057 extragalactic objects selected as quasar targets with @xmath39 , which were not targeted as galaxies because they are unresolved , and we include them in our galaxy sample . among these 100,741 galaxies ,",
    "most of them ( 99,990 ) have redshift @xmath40 , guaranteeing that the @xmath41 emission line lies in our spectral coverage .",
    "@xmath41 is a very useful emission line in identifying agn ( equation  [ eq : kewleyline ] ) , and we limit our galaxy sample to these 99,990 objects .",
    "agn are identified by their emission line characteristics .",
    "as described in @xmath38 , the sdss galaxy spectra are taken through a fixed @xmath42 aperture , which is large enough to let through not only the light from the nucleus but also substantial amounts of stellar light from the host galaxy .",
    "for example , at the median redshift of the sample ( @xmath43 ) , a @xmath42 aperture subtends about @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , galaxies with higher redshift will have a larger host galaxy component in the observed spectra .",
    "thus the nuclear emission lines are often contaminated by the stellar absorption lines of the host galaxy . for weak agn",
    ", this contamination can be so severe that the interesting emission lines are completely submerged in the absorption lines .",
    "thus before considering agn selection , we have to develop a technique to properly remove the stellar absorption lines .",
    "the basic idea of stellar subtraction is to build a library of stellar absorption line spectra templates , and use them as building blocks to simulate the stellar spectrum of the object in question .",
    "the library needs to be complete in the sense that it contains enough information on various absorption features to be able to simulate the stellar components of various galaxies with widely spread metallicities , ages and velocity dispersions . the library is typically composed of star spectra generated from a population synthesis code ( bica 1988 ; saraiva 2001 , kauffmann 2003b ) or direct observational spectra of absorption line galaxies ( ho 1997a ) or stars ( engelbracht 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "the library is constructed by applying the principal component analysis ( pca ) technique ( e.g connolly 1995 ; lahav 1996 ; bromley 1998 ; eisenstein 2003 ; yip 2004 ) to a sample of pure absorption - line galaxies",
    ".    the advantages of building stellar absorption templates via this method are two - fold : only the first few eigenspectra are significant , so we can limit the size of the library without losing much useful information .",
    "moreover , the eigenspectra are orthogonal to each other , resulting in a unique solution to the stellar subtraction fit using these templates .",
    "we wish to identify a sample of pure absorption - line galaxies . in practice , we require that the @xmath41 equivalent width ew(@xmath41)@xmath450 ( positive ew corresponds to emission lines ) , and that [ oii]@xmath46 not be detected .",
    "[ oii]@xmath47 is used because it is always apparent even in very weak emission line galaxies . due to the presence of complex absorption near",
    "[ oii]@xmath47 , we measure this line after subtracting a preliminary pca sample solely with the requirement that ew(@xmath41)@xmath450 .",
    "a gaussian function is fit to the residuals between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if the @xmath36 of the fit is less than the @xmath36 of a linear fit minus 3 , the line is considered significant , and the object is rejected as an absorption - line galaxy .    by limiting ourselves further to high s / n spectra , we defined three samples of several hundred pure absorption line galaxies grouped by their redshifts : 325 galaxies with @xmath50 ; 338 with @xmath51 and 372 with @xmath52 .",
    "pca is done on each group separately , giving three sets of eigenspectra that each can be used to subtract stellar components for galaxies of similar redshifts .",
    "we divide the sample in three groups in order to obtain a larger wavelength coverage for each group as well as the resultant eigenspectra .",
    "figure  [ fig:3mean ] shows the mean of the spectra ( i.e. , the first eigenspectrum ) in each galaxy group .",
    "they are essentially identical , although the lowest - redshift sample has slightly higher s / n .    the galaxies within the three groups are shifted to fixed rest - frame wavelength bins using sinc interpolation .",
    "afterwards , each spectrum is normalized to a constant flux value . unlike some pca analyses ( e.g. , eisenstein 2003 ) ,",
    "the continua are not subtracted from the spectra before pca .",
    "each sample includes several hundred normalized galaxy spectra , which we express as a matrix @xmath53 of dimensions @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total number of galaxies in each group and @xmath56 is the total number of common wavelength bins .",
    "singular value decomposition ( svd ) is used to build the eigenspectra ( connolly 1995 ; bromley 1998 ) .",
    "the pca analysis generates a set of eigenspectra , with main features of the absorption - line galaxies concentrated in the first few . in this study",
    "we will use the first eight eigenspectra as the stellar absorption - line templates .",
    "empirical tests show that including more eigenspectra , which are basically just noise , does not improve the subtraction further .",
    "a @xmath36 minimizing algorithm was adopted to determine the synthetic stellar absorption spectrum for each galaxy .",
    "the minimizing is done over the entire observed wavelength range except regions around the strongest emission lines found in agn and starforming galaxies : @xmath41 , h@xmath8 , [ nii]@xmath57 , [ oiii]@xmath58,@xmath59 and [ oii]@xmath60 .",
    "since the stellar templates are eigenspectra of a sample of pure absorption line galaxies and galaxies having young stellar populations tend to have emission lines , the resultant eigenspectra mainly represent old stellar spectral features . thus these eigenspectra are not representative of galaxies containing a young stellar component",
    ". one possible resolution would be to make sure that the pca sample included enough e+a galaxies , which contain young stellar populations and do not have emission lines ( goto 2003 ; quintero 2004 ) . in this work , however , we simply add an a star spectrum selected from the sdss spectroscopic data to the absorption - line template library to represent the young stellar population .",
    "figure  [ fig : astar ] shows an example of the stellar subtraction with and without this template , for a galaxy with a young star population .",
    "the improvement using the a star template is dramatic .",
    "the stellar subtraction is automatically done to all galaxies in our parent galaxy sample , including those quasars that satisfy the galaxy target selection magnitude cut ( @xmath61 2 and 3 ) . however , doing stellar subtraction to a bright quasar dominated by a non - thermal continuum in the spectrum will certainly be a disaster . we thus add a pure power - law spectrum , written as @xmath62 , to our template library .",
    "figure  [ fig : powerlawsub ] shows an example of stellar subtraction for a quasar with and without the power - law template .",
    "the power - law template significantly improves the subtraction .",
    "since the spectrophotometry is not perfect , quasars have a range of intrinsic power - law slopes ( richards 2002 ) , and the power law fit can be systematically in error due to feii emission ( figure  [ fig : powerlawsub ] and vanden berk 2001 ) , the power - law template will certainly not be sufficient for clean continuum subtraction for all quasars",
    ". however we have found it to be adequate for our purposes . for galaxies",
    "that do not have a nonthermal power - law component , this template can help compensate for continuum shape errors due to errors in spectrophotometry and internal reddening .",
    "in summary , our template library includes 8 pca eigenspectra of pure absorption line galaxies , a power - law continuum and an a star spectrum . as demonstrated in figures  [ fig : astar ] ,  [ fig : powerlawsub ] and further in figure  [ fig : subvd ] , weak emission lines such as h@xmath8 that were originally submerged in the stellar absorption line are successfully recovered .",
    "moreover , emission lines such as [ oi]@xmath63 and [ ni]@xmath7 which are not apparent at all in the original spectrum clearly stand out after the subtraction .",
    "the subtraction also helps correct the strength of @xmath41 , which is very important in subsequent agn identification using emission line ratios .",
    "the stellar subtraction is robust for galaxies of a range of velocity dispersions .",
    "figure  [ fig : subvd ] shows two galaxies with very different velocity dispersions ( bernardi 2003 ) ; note that in both cases , the subtracted spectrum shows no appreciable residuals of the strong absorption lines .",
    "the eigenspectra include terms that can give absorption lines of different width .",
    "this is another advantage of the pca technique over the use of stellar libraries : we do not need to convolve each template with a gaussian broadening function for each galaxy .",
    "the whole procedure of doing pca and stellar subtraction using the resultant eigenspectra is quite straightforward .",
    "once the stellar component is subtracted , the emission lines can be measured , as we now describe .",
    "since we are mainly interested in emission - line galaxies , we will first set up a criterion to remove the pure absorption - line galaxies from the parent sample .",
    "we require that the ew of the @xmath41 line ( in the rest frame ) be greater than @xmath64 . in the rare cases in which the @xmath41 line is saturated or affected by bad pixels ,",
    "we examine the equivalent width of the [ oiii]@xmath5 and h@xmath8 lines , requiring that one of them be greater than @xmath65 .",
    "these equivalent widths are based on the line strength after stellar continuum subtraction , divided by the stellar continuum itself .",
    "this criterion also rejects weak emission line galaxies .",
    "this is acceptable since the s / n ratio for these lines will be low and thus our ability to distinguish agn from starbursts will be poor .",
    "a total of 42,435 galaxies , about half of the parent galaxy sample , pass the equivalent width cut .",
    "we refer to this sample as the emission line galaxy sample .",
    "all agn are selected from this sample .",
    "the intensity , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , central wavelength and nearby continuum value of the main emission lines in these galaxies are measured via gaussian fits weighted by the estimated errors per pixel .",
    "the following emission lines are needed for agn selection : h@xmath0 , [ nii]@xmath66 , h@xmath8 , [ oiii]@xmath67 , [ sii]@xmath68 and [ oi]@xmath6 .",
    "the following lines are fit with a single gaussian : h@xmath8 , [ oiii]@xmath5 and [ oi]@xmath6 .",
    "the [ sii ] doublet is fit with a two - gaussian function model .",
    "the fwhms and intensities of the two gaussians are independent of each other , while the central wavelengths are correlated with a single variable @xmath69 , and the continuum is shared by the two gaussian functions . since our fitting",
    "is done to a stellar continuum subtracted spectrum that has been shifted to rest wavelength , the fitting results for @xmath69 and the continuum are very close to zero .",
    "the h@xmath0 and [ nii]@xmath70 lines are fitted with three gaussians .",
    "the fwhms of the [ nii ] lines are kept the same and the intensity ratio of [ nii]@xmath10 to [ nii]@xmath71 is fixed to 3 , as required by the energy level structure of the [ nii ] ion ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "again , the central wavelengths of @xmath41 and the [ nii ] doublet are correlated with a single redshift parameter and the three lines share the same continuum value .",
    "the pixels located within @xmath72 of the central wavelength of the emission lines are used for gaussian fits ( adjacent emission lines in this range are shielded out ) .",
    "however , in order to be sensitive to a broad component of @xmath41 , we fit the @xmath41 , [ nii ] group to the range @xmath73 ( the adjacent [ oi ] and [ sii ] lines are masked in the fit ) .",
    "we will use the @xmath36 of the fit to test for the significance of the broad component , restricting ourselves to the range @xmath74 to reduce the sensitivity to uncertainties in the continuum .",
    "some agn show both broad and narrow permitted emission lines . for these galaxies ,",
    "a single gaussian function for @xmath41 is obviously not appropriate . to take this into account",
    ", we also fit the @xmath41 and [ nii ] doublet with a four - gaussian model : two for the [ nii ] lines and two for @xmath41 .",
    "the two @xmath41 gaussian functions have the same central wavelength , but different intensities and fwhms .",
    "the final decision of which model ( the three - gaussian model or the four - gaussian model ) to use for a given galaxy is done by comparing the @xmath36 of the two model fits , @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . in particular , we choose the four - gaussian model fit when : @xmath77 this criterion is empirical , but is inspired by a similar statistic for linear fitting models ( lupton 1993 ) .",
    "if we would like to fit a data set ( @xmath78 ) with a linear fitting model @xmath79 , and the errors @xmath80 are gaussian , then @xmath81 follows a @xmath82 distribution , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the numbers of the data points and the parameters used in the model respectively . if there are two linear models @xmath56 and @xmath55 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 parameters respectively ( i.e. model @xmath56 has @xmath32 extra parameters ) , their @xmath36 functions @xmath86 , @xmath87 will then follow @xmath82 and @xmath88 distributions .",
    "it can be proved that for linear models , @xmath87 and @xmath89 are independent , thus the quantity @xmath90 follows a @xmath91 distribution .",
    "if @xmath92 is large , then we can accept the hypothesis that the added parameters significantly improve the fit .    in our case , our models are non - linear in the parameters , and @xmath87 and @xmath89 will not be independent .",
    "the four - gaussian model has two more degrees of freedom than does the three - gaussian model , so the numerator of the criterion is written as @xmath93 .",
    "the limit `` 0.2 '' in equation  ( [ eq : chi ] ) is an empirical number and is demonstrated to be appropriate from our manual inspection .",
    "however it is not always unambiguous to identify the broad @xmath41 component using the above criterion , since not all emission lines are well - fit with gaussians ( strateva 2003 ) . in particular ,",
    "narrow emission lines generally have extended wings at their bases ( ho 1997b ) .",
    "if the narrow emission line is strong , this non - gaussian feature will become prominent , and a 4-gaussian model will be chosen by equation  [ eq : chi ] . in this case , the height of the broader component @xmath94 will be small compared to the height of the narrow component , @xmath95 and the gaussian width of the broader component @xmath96 will be relatively small . to not count such cases as broad line ,",
    "we stick with the 3-gaussian fit for those objects which satisfy , @xmath97 no matter what the criterion of equation  ( [ eq : chi ] ) might indicate .",
    "we compared our empirical criterion ( equation  ( [ eq : chicorrect ] ) ) with the well defined bayesian information criterion ( bic , liddle 2004 ) .",
    "we found that we are as efficient in choosing broad - line component as bic , and at the same time , our criterion identifies far fewer fake broad - line components than bic does .",
    "after fitting all relevant emission lines , the line strengths are calculated based on the line fitting parameters .",
    "the observed sdss spectra are accompanied by an estimated error per pixel , based on photon and read noise statistics and variation among sky spectra .",
    "these errors are approximately independent between pixels and are good to 8% ( mcdonald 2004 ) . in stellar continuum subtraction",
    "we assumed the stellar templates perfect since they are very high s / n .",
    "the errors in the line strengths are calculated using standard propagation of errors .",
    "those emission lines that are less than @xmath98 detections are marked as weak .",
    "if they are needed in identifying an agn , special care should be applied ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the measured emission line parameters can be used to identify agn from the emission line galaxy sample .",
    "we select broad - line agn by checking the @xmath41 line width .",
    "figure  [ fig : broad ] gives the distribution of the fwhm values of the @xmath41 emission line for over 40,000 emission line galaxies .",
    "for galaxies that prefer two gaussian components for @xmath41 ( @xmath37 ) , the width of the broader component is plotted .",
    "the distribution is clearly bimodal , with a minimum at 1,200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the first peak is at about 200 km s@xmath1 , which reflects the resolution limit of the sdss spectrographs .",
    "it extends far above the limit of the plot , demonstrating that most of the galaxies in the sample are starforming galaxies with narrow @xmath41 lines .",
    "clearly separated from these normal galaxies , the second group of galaxies has substantially larger @xmath41 fwhm value .",
    "naturally , we use fwhm(@xmath41)@xmath100 km s@xmath1 as the selection criterion for defining broad - line agn .",
    "the inserted plot in figure  [ fig : broad ] shows the @xmath41 fwhm distribution for agn only ( the detailed selection of narrow - line agn is described in @xmath99 ) .",
    "narrow - line agn have typical @xmath41 fwhm values similar to those of usual emission - line galaxies .",
    "the paucity of objects with fwhm @xmath101 km s@xmath1 is not well understood and will need to be explained in agn unification models .",
    "however , we should make sure that the bimodality is not a consequence of our fitting procedure in choosing the 4-gaussian fitting model over the 3-gaussian model . to do so , we intentionally change the limiting numbers of the criteria described in @xmath37 .",
    "we write the criteria ( equations  ( [ eq : chi ] ) and ( [ eq : chicorrect ] ) ) as : @xmath102 our default values are @xmath103 , @xmath104 ( 2182 km s@xmath1 ) , @xmath105 .",
    "now we change this set of numbers to @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( 3249 km s@xmath1 ) , @xmath108 separately .",
    "the changes will all reduce the number of objects with broad @xmath41 components .",
    "however , those galaxies which are distinctively broad will still be selected by the new criteria .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ fig : bimocheck ] shows the @xmath41 fwhm distribution with the changed criteria .",
    "as can be seen , no matter how the criteria are changed , the bimodality feature and the minimum at about 1,200 km s@xmath1 remain the same even though the number of selected broad - line agn changes substantially .",
    "a complementary test is to loosen the criteria a little . out of the concern that the @xmath104 cut",
    "might artificially reject objects with fwhm around 1,200 km s@xmath1 , we change this criterion to @xmath109 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : bimocheck ] shows the @xmath41 fwhm distribution with @xmath103 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively .",
    "this yields many false broad - line agn .",
    "however , the bimodality and the location of the minimum are still the same . therefore , the bimodal feature is insensitive to the specific details of the criteria in equation  ( [ eq:4fitall_abc ] ) .",
    "one might also suspect that the bimodality is caused by the fact that the values we have used in the plot are coming from two different fitting models . in the distribution plot",
    ", the values of the narrower group usually come from the fitting parameters of the 3-gaussian model while those of the broader group are mostly from the 4-gaussian model .",
    "the change from one model to another might cause some discontinuity in an otherwise continuous distribution . to test this , figure  [ fig:3fitbimodal ] shows the distribution of width using the 3-gaussian model fits alone ; the bimodal feature is still apparent .    as a final check of the reality of the deficit of galaxies with fwhm@xmath101 km s@xmath1",
    ", we carried out simulations of galaxies with composite @xmath41 profiles , in which the broad component had 1200 km s@xmath1 @xmath111 fwhm @xmath111 2200 km s@xmath1 and @xmath112 , and to which we add a stellar continuum and characteristic noise .",
    "after putting these objects through our code , we found that we would miss only a small fraction of broad - line agn with @xmath41 fwhm close to 1,200 km s@xmath1 , not nearly enough to explain the bimodality .",
    "therefore , the bimodal feature is clearly real .    defining broad - line agn as objects with @xmath41 fwhm @xmath100 km s@xmath1 , 1317 broad - line agn",
    "are identified from 42,435 emission line galaxies . for those galaxies that need two @xmath41 gaussian functions but are not classified as broad ( fwhm(@xmath41)@xmath113 km s@xmath1 )",
    ", we use a 3-gaussian fit for @xmath41 and [ nii ] so that we can have consistent @xmath41 measurements when they are used in emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams , as we now describe .",
    "narrow - line agn can not be separated cleanly from star - forming galaxies by their emission line widths .",
    "therefore , we will use the traditional emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; section 1 ) to select them . in figure",
    "[ fig : diagram ] we place the galaxies in the emission line galaxy sample in these diagrams(broad - line agn selected in section 6.1 are excluded ) .",
    "galaxies with relevant emission lines detected with less than @xmath98 significance are omitted in the diagrams .",
    "there are roughly 40,000 galaxies contained in the [ nii]/@xmath41 and [ sii]/@xmath41 diagrams , but only about 23,000 galaxies in the [ oi]/@xmath41 diagram . due to the large number of galaxies available",
    ", we can see a continuous distribution in the diagrams .",
    "agn have larger [ oiii]/h@xmath8 , [ nii]/@xmath41 , [ oi]/@xmath41 and [ sii]/@xmath41 values than do starbursts , and are clearly separated from the loci formed by starforming galaxies .",
    "the agn and starforming galaxy separation lines developed by kauffmann ( 2003a , short - dashed ) , kewley ( 2001 , solid ) and veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 , dash - dot ) are plotted in the diagram .",
    "kauffmann s and kewley s criteria agree much better with the shape of the density profile ; the disagreement between kewley s lines and the data are almost all in the @xmath114dex error range ( dashed lines ) .    within kewley",
    "s separation scheme , we can identify agn as those located to the upper right of the lines . about 10% of all emission line galaxies",
    "are classified differently in the three diagrams .",
    "we will refer to these as mismatched galaxies .",
    "one half of these are classified as agn by the [ oi]/@xmath41 diagram , but not by the other two .",
    "the same discrepancy was also noticed by stasiska & leitherer ( 1996 ) and dopita ( 2000 ) , who ascribed the enhancement of [ oi ] lines in starburst galaxies to the mechanical energy released into the gas by supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "dopita ( 1997 ) noted that when even a weak shock compresses the gas , the postshock local ionization is sharply lowered , leading to a strong enhancement of the [ oi ] lines .",
    "another quarter of the mismatched galaxies are those classified as agn in the [ sii]/@xmath41 diagram but not in the [ nii]/@xmath41 diagram , and the [ oi ] line is of too low significance to use the [ oi]/@xmath41 diagram . the cause could again be shock excitation : the relatively cool high - density regions formed behind the shock front emit strong [ sii ] emission lines ( dopita 2000 ) .",
    "the remaining quarter of the mismatched galaxies are randomly distributed , possibly due to noise .",
    "overall , about 95% of the mismatched objects have enhanced [ oi ] or [ sii ] emission lines compared to the [ nii ] lines , perhaps due to shock excitation from supernovae and stellar winds in a starburst galaxy .",
    "the small overall number of mismatches demonstrates that kewley s theoretical separation lines give very consistent excitation mechanism classifications among the three diagrams .    using kewley s scheme",
    ", we define the galaxies located to the upper right of the lines in all three diagrams as narrow - line agn .",
    "if the emission lines used in the diagrams are weak ( @xmath37 ) , we take special care : if the [ nii ] or [ oiii ] line is found to be weak , the galaxy will not be identified as an agn unless the @xmath41 line is also broad .",
    "however , if the [ oi ] line or [ sii ] line is found to be weak , then the classification based on the [ oi]/@xmath41 or [ sii]/@xmath41 diagram is defined to be inconclusive and the identification of the galaxy depends on the remaining diagrams .",
    "galaxies with one or two inconclusive classifications and agn classifications in the remaining diagram(s ) are also included in our sample .",
    "we do not include any mismatched objects in the final narrow - line agn sample .",
    "based on these criteria , 3074 narrow - line agn are selected .",
    "the selection criteria are different from those used by kauffmann ( 2003a ) ( equation  [ eq : kauff ] , figure  [ fig : diagram ] short - dashed line ) . in the [ nii]/@xmath41 vs. [ oiii]/@xmath115 diagram ,",
    "galaxies are distributed on two arms .",
    "normal galaxies have weaker [ nii]/@xmath41 ratio than do agn .",
    "so it is expected that they form the locus on the left arm ( with smaller [ nii]/@xmath41 values ) and galaxies on the right arm are agn .",
    "but kewley s line cuts through the right arm .",
    "kauffmann propose to classify all galaxies located on the right arm as agn , generating an empirical line separating the two branches .",
    "this line lies well below kewley s criterion in the [ nii]/@xmath41 diagram and the number of galaxies which fall between the two criteria is very large .",
    "this difference between the two criteria will cause tremendous disagreement on agn statistics .",
    "if kauffmann s criterion is adopted , we would have selected about 10,700 narrow - line agn , roughly three times the agn selected via kewley s criterion . to understand the disagreement better",
    ", we divide the galaxies in the right arm into several groups by their locations along the arm ; each group is assigned a different color in figure  [ fig:2ndarm ] .",
    "these galaxies are accordingly plotted in the [ oi]/@xmath41 and [ sii]/@xmath41 vs. [ oiii]/@xmath115 diagrams .",
    "in addition , we plot the @xmath41 fwhm distribution for the galaxies in each group . very interestingly , galaxies in the right arm form a similar sequence in the three diagrams : galaxies with larger [ nii]/@xmath41 values usually have larger [ oi]/@xmath41 and [ sii]/@xmath41 values . furthermore ,",
    "galaxies with larger [ nii]/@xmath41 or [ oiii]/@xmath115 values typically have broader @xmath41 emission lines .",
    "this gives us a hint that some galaxies on the right arm might be galaxies with mixed agn and starburst components , with a larger agn component corresponding to a higher position on the diagrams ( kauffmann 2003a ) .",
    "however , some of the agn and starburst composite galaxies are degenerate with starforming galaxies with widely spread metallicity and ionization parameters , especially in the [ oi]/@xmath41 and [ sii]/@xmath41 vs. [ oiii]/@xmath115 diagrams . because of the degeneracy , kewley s separation lines , which are the upper limit for pure starburst galaxies , are unable to identify every galaxy with an agn contribution .",
    "therefore , the agn sample created using kauffmann s criterion includes these agn + starburst composite galaxies ; they make up the majority of the sample . while these galaxies include an appreciable contamination from star formation in their emission line strengths , the star formation contribution to [ oiii ] is relatively weak ( kauffmann 2003a ) .",
    "the agn sample created using kewley s criterion includes only those that are unambiguously agn dominated .",
    "both samples have their pros and cons , so we will keep both samples . in hao ( 2005 ; paper ii ) , the luminosity functions are measured for both samples and the results are compared .",
    "some of the narrow - line agn have very strong low ionization lines ; these objects are `` low ionization nuclear emission line regions '' ( `` liners '' ) .",
    "ever since the first definition of the liner class by heckman ( 1980 ) , the excitation mechanism causing liners has remained unknown .",
    "there is vigorous debate on whether or not liners belong to the agn family .",
    "filippenko ( 1985 ) showed that many liners have a broad emission - line component , suggesting they are indeed agn .",
    "kewley ( 2001 ) established a series of starburst models and developed a set of extreme mixing lines , below which the galaxies can only be modeled by pure shocks without an ionizing precursor , or a power - law ionizing radiation field with an extremely low ionization parameter .",
    "the long - dashed lines in figure  [ fig : diagram ] show the extreme mixing line in the [ oi]/@xmath41 diagram .",
    "if this line alone is adopted here in selecting liners , there are 650 liners identified in the narrow - line agn sample .",
    "these objects will be studied in detail in future work and will not be discussed further here .",
    "it is interesting to know how the narrow components of broad - line agn are located on the diagrams . in figure",
    "[ fig : broadindiagram ] , we select those broad - line agn with real narrow @xmath41 components ( whose line widths are less than @xmath116 ) and plot their emission line ratio with the narrow components of @xmath41 and @xmath115 in the diagram . most of the broad - line agn are concentrated on the right arm of the [ nii]/@xmath41 vs. [ oiii]/@xmath115 diagram , indicating a strong agn contribution .",
    "therefore , the classifications of these galaxies from the narrow component and the broad component are consistent .",
    "there are also some broad - line agn with their narrow components corresponding to locations to the right of the mixing line in the [ oi]/@xmath41 diagram ( figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) , these can be characterized as liners ( filippenko 1985 ) .",
    "the final agn sample includes 1,317 broad - line agn , 3,074 narrow - line agn if kewley s criteria are adopted and 10,700 narrow - line agn with kauffmann s criteria .",
    "this agn sample is complete over 1151 square degrees , defined by the criteria described in this paper ] .",
    "the large number of high quality spectra available in the sdss provides us with great opportunities for agn studies . in this paper , we have systematically identified agn from the sdss spectroscopic data from their emission line characteristics . in order to make unbiased measurements of the emission lines , we have carefully subtracted absorption stellar spectra from the observed spectra .",
    "the absorption line templates are constructed by applying pca to pure absorption line galaxies .",
    "emission lines are measured from corrected emission line spectra by fitting gaussian functions .",
    "in particular , to obtain proper identification of broad emission lines , the @xmath41 and [ nii ] emission lines are fitted with both a three - gaussian model and a four - gaussian model .",
    "the final decision of which model to use is based on a comparison of @xmath117 values of the two model fits .    using measured parameters of the @xmath41 emission lines ,",
    "broad - line agn are identified .",
    "it is found that the distribution of @xmath41 fwhm values of emission - line galaxies in the parent sample is bimodal , with two populations separated at about 1,200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "various tests have been applied to confirm that this feature is not caused by selection effects .",
    "the bimodal feature also gives a natural separation between broad - line and narrow - line agn , and is significant in understanding the `` unified theory '' of agn .",
    "a naive explanation could be that the physical parameters of the torus are correlated with the black hole mass .",
    "for an agn with a black hole mass less than a certain value , the dust torus becomes so large that it almost totally blocks the broad - line region .",
    "therefore , it is hard to observe any broad - line component with small @xmath41 fwhm values .",
    "narrow - line agn are identified using traditional diagnostic diagrams . due to the large number of galaxies available ,",
    "starforming galaxies follow well - defined loci",
    ". theoretical separation lines between agn and starforming galaxies developed by kewley ( 2001 ) agree fairly well with the shape of the galaxy density contour and bring few mismatched classifications among the three diagrams . only in the [ nii]/@xmath41 diagram",
    "does kewley s line seem to disagree with the data , where the galaxies are distributed into two arms and kewley s line cuts through the right arm ( larger [ nii]/@xmath41 value ) .",
    "kauffmann ( 2003a ) argued that all objects in the right arm should be considered as agn .",
    "based on the sdss data , they proposed to use the empirical line separating the two arms to select agn .",
    "this line is lower than kewley s line , and would classify many more objects than kewley s criterion as narrow - line agn .",
    "we demonstrated that agn selected via kewley s criterion only include those that are dominated by active nuclear activity , while agn selected via kauffmann s criterion also includes agn + starburst composite galaxies .",
    "both samples have their pros and cons , and we keep both for further studies .",
    "the final agn sample , complete to magnitude cut @xmath118 , includes 1317 broad - line and 3074 narrow - line agn ( 10,700 if kauffmann s criterion is used ) over 1151 square degrees .",
    "this is based on 1/8 the eventual sdss survey ; the sample will grow substantially .",
    "this sample is very useful for various studies .",
    "first , with the large number of agn in this sample , we can evaluate the agn luminosity functions ; we carry out this analysis in paper ii .",
    "second , by correlating these agn with their host galaxy parameters , we can study the relationship between agn and their host galaxies for both narrow - line ( kauffmann 2003a ) and broad - line agn .",
    "third , from the velocity dispersion of the agn host galaxies , we can directly measure the approximate black hole mass using the @xmath119 relation developed first in quiescent galaxies ( gebhardt 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine 2002 ) , and further derive the accretion rate for various types of agn ( heckman 2004 ) .",
