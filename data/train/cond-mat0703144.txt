    "dynamical evolution of a spin system following a quench to zero temperature from a disordered state may lead to a non - equilibrium state , e.g. , as in the one dimensional annni ( axial next nearest neighbor ising ) model @xcite which has the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spin at the @xmath12th site and @xmath13 is the ratio of the second neighbour and first neighbour interactions . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the quench does not lead to the equilibrium configuration which is ferromagnetic for @xmath15 and antiphase for @xmath16 . starting from a random state",
    ", there is a short initial time during which the domains of size one die and this eventually results in a configuration with fixed number of domain walls . in this state ,",
    "the domain walls become `` fluid '' in the sense that they can move indefinitely ( keeping the energy of the system same ) @xcite but can not cross each other . in such a system",
    "the persistence dynamics shows that the number of persistent spins is neither a power law nor exponential but rather follows a stretched exponential decay , @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the above dynamical scenario can easily be represented by an equivalent system of mutually avoiding random walkers and the fraction of persistent spins will then be given by the fraction of unvisited sites @xmath0 till time @xmath1 in the system @xcite .",
    "representation of the spin dynamics by random walk of domain walls is well - known ; in the common examples like the ising or potts model , the random walk is accompanied by annihilation of two domain walls if they meet @xcite .    in the original annni model problem ,",
    "when there are @xmath20 domains with each separated by at least two lattice spacings , the probability distribution of the number of domain walls @xmath20 within a size @xmath21 is @xmath22 this equation is easy to derive once it is realised that the problem is identical to the bose statistics of distributing @xmath21 particles in @xmath20 boxes with the number of particles in each box greater than or equal to 2 .",
    "it has been observed that the ratio @xmath23 has a mean value quite close to the most probable value @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "distribution of the value of @xmath25 can be calculated numerically which shows that its fluctuation decreases with the system size ( typically @xmath26 decreases from 0.0645 for @xmath27 to 0.0225 for @xmath28 in a power law manner , @xmath29 ) .",
    "this indicates that the annni dynamics reflects the behavior of @xmath0 for a specific value of the density of walkers in the equivalent random wall picture .",
    "it is therefore a meaningful exercise to find out @xmath0 for general density @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of mutually exclusive walkers and @xmath21 the chain length . in this paper",
    "we have considered @xmath32 and calculated numerically @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 shows a stretched exponential behaviour with an exponent close to 1/2 .",
    "this problem , as we have shown , can be mapped to that of the independent random walkers with a subtle difference and also for small @xmath5 .",
    "the latter problem has been exactly solved @xcite and we compare its results with that of the numerical simulation of mutually repulsive walkers to find a good agreement at small values of @xmath5 .",
    "our results also show a difference when persistence is calculated in terms of a spin system and the system of pure brownian walkers which we have discussed in the paper .",
    "some other dynamical properties have been investigated in this context .",
    "to keep correspondence with the original spin dynamics of the annni model , any of the site in the system may be selected for updating .",
    "it may or may not contain a random walker . if it does , then the step taken by this random walker is according to the following three situations : + 1 . if the walker is flanked by two random walkers on both sides ; it can not make any movement and stays there - this corresponds to a locked domain wall ( fig 1a ) .",
    "+ 2 . there are no neighbouring random walker , then the random walker remains at its position with probability @xmath33 - this corresponds to the probability that a spin does not flip even at the domain boundary .",
    "it can also move to either left or right with equal probability ( fig 1b ) .",
    "there is only one neighbouring walker , say , to the left ( right ) , then it does not move or moves to the right ( left ) ( fig1 ( c ) and ( d ) ) with equal probability .",
    "+ let us represent this dynamical rule by @xmath34 , a dynamics which corresponds to the annni model dynamics",
    ".    as the walls are reflecting , if the random walker happens to hit the wall , it can only step in - wards or stay there .",
    "when @xmath21 sites are hit , one monte carlo step is said to be completed .    it may be noted that in the original annni model , domain walls need to maintain a least distance of two lattice spacings .",
    "we have relaxed this condition to one lattice spacing which is equivalent to having on - site repulsion of random walkers .",
    "effectively , this means that the original ratio @xmath35 in annni corresponds to @xmath36 in the present case .",
    "the starting position of the random walkers may be assumed to be either already visited or not yet visited .",
    "the calculation of persistence will depend on it .",
    "in what we call the spin picture ( sp ) , they are unvisited and in the random walker picture ( rwp ) they are assumed to be visited already .",
    "this brings in a subtle difference in the two problems .",
    "we have discussed the two problems separately in the following two subsections .",
    "first , we calculate the survival probability @xmath0 defined as the probability that a site has not been visited by any of the random walkers till time @xmath1 .",
    "( this corresponds to @xmath37 , the persistence probability of the original annni model with @xmath38 . )    in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath0 is plotted against time @xmath1 for different densities @xmath5 with a fixed lattice size @xmath39 . in each case",
    ", @xmath0 decays with time following a stretched exponential behavior @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "this value of @xmath3 compares well with @xmath42 obtained for @xmath37 in the annni model @xcite .",
    "increasing the system size does not affect the result , only the variation of @xmath0 can be observed over a longer duration of time .",
    "interestingly , the value of @xmath43 increases with the the increase of the density @xmath5 till the value of @xmath44 . beyond this value , @xmath43 decreases gradually as the density increases roughly as @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the behaviour of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 will be discussed in greater detail in the next section .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 is not difficult to explain . for small values of @xmath5 , the probability that a domain wall is hit is small and",
    "therefore one gets a slow decay of @xmath0 with time . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath5 ,",
    "most of the domain walls will be ` locked ' such that again the variation of @xmath0 will be slow .",
    "for very small @xmath5 , we have checked that @xmath46 holds good to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "effectively this means that the relaxation rate at @xmath47 is twice as much as that at @xmath48 .",
    "this can be explained in the following manner : at @xmath47 , an empty site occurs with a probability @xmath45 but has both neighbours occupied with a very high probability , almost one . at @xmath48 , an empty site having an occupied neighbour is very rare ( probability proportional to @xmath49 . in the former , in one iteration",
    ", the empty site can be visited by either of its neighbouring walkers while in the latter , visit to the empty site is possible by one walker only , making the time scale double .",
    "is plotted against the density @xmath5 for both the sp ( spin picture ) and rwp ( random walkers picture ) for the dynamical rule @xmath34 ( see section ii ) .",
    "both the curves follow a behaviour @xmath50 for small @xmath5 , shown by the dashed line.,width=226 ]    one can now compare the value of @xmath4 obtained in the present study with that of the annni model where @xmath51 . in @xcite ,",
    "the value of @xmath4 was found to be equal to 1.06 .",
    "for @xmath52 , we find that @xmath4 is very close to the value 1 ( fig .",
    "3 ) showing again a good agreement with the annni model dynamics .      in the rwp",
    "everything remains same but the initial sites occupied by the random walkers are assumed to be already visited .",
    "now we find that @xmath0 again has a stretched exponential behaviour : @xmath53 with @xmath54 . now",
    "@xmath55 does not show any non - monotonic behaviour but appears to diverge as @xmath47 .",
    "this is again understandable , in the present picture , when @xmath5 is close to one , most of the sites are already non - persistent to begin with and @xmath0 decays very fast making @xmath56 .",
    "the exponents @xmath57 and @xmath3 are apparently equal in the two pictures . in fig .",
    "3 the behaviour of @xmath55 against @xmath5 is also shown .",
    "it is to be noted that upto @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath55 are equal and behave differently beyond this point . for the sp , the possibility of the domains getting locked increase as @xmath5 increases and this happens with a higher probability beyond @xmath60 .",
    "in the last section we obtained the result that the fraction of unvisited sites @xmath0 in presence of mutually repulsive walkers has a stretched exponential decay with exponent 1/2 in both the sp and rwp .",
    "this behaviour turns out to be exactly the same as that of @xmath61 , the number of unvisited sites in the presence of independent or non - interacting walkers . in the latter system",
    "it has been shown @xcite that when @xmath6 is the density of independent walkers , @xmath62 with @xmath63 .    in this section",
    "we show that the interacting system can be mapped to the independent walkers system with the transformation @xmath8 . to show this ,",
    "let us consider a configuration @xmath64 of @xmath31 interacting walkers of density @xmath5 which follow a dynamics represented by @xmath65 .",
    "for the present discussion , we make the dynamics @xmath65 simpler than @xmath34 : the walker will always execute a movement when at least one of the neighbouring site is vacant - if both are vacant , probability to move either to the left or to the right is 1/2 . in case",
    "only one neighbouring site is occupied , the random walker will move to the empty neighbouring site .",
    "( one obtains the same behaviour of @xmath0 with this rule , including the relation ( [ twice ] ) , only the numerical value of @xmath4 increases by a factor of @xmath66 compared to @xmath34 where the time scale is simply double compared to @xmath65 . )    for the independent walkers , let us consider a configuration @xmath67 of @xmath31 walkers of density @xmath6 , who do not `` see '' each other .",
    "the dynamics @xmath68 here is simply that each walker will move to left or right with equal probability .",
    "the world lines in the 1 + 1 dimension of the walkers are shown in fig 4a and 4b .",
    "now let us create a mapping of the original configuration @xmath64 to @xmath69 given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the position of the @xmath72th walker ( @xmath73 from the left ) at time @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "effectively this mapping implies that one spacing between consecutive walkers is being removed .",
    "this would remove the constraint in @xmath64 that two walkers have hard core repulsion and each world line of @xmath69 therefore also occurs in @xmath67 .",
    "although all world lines of @xmath69 and @xmath67 have one to one correspondence , in @xmath69 one has the constraint that @xmath74 while in @xmath67 there is no such constraint .",
    "therefore a particular configuration may occur with different weight factors in @xmath67 and @xmath69 ( figures 4b , c , and d ) .    ) and ( b ) independent walkers ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "( c ) the mapped configuration @xmath69 following eq",
    ". 6 . in ( d ) , another realisation for the independent walkers is possible by switching the order of the walkers at the later time .",
    "this is not allowed in @xmath69.,width=264 ]    using the above mapping , the effective chain length in @xmath69 is @xmath75 and not @xmath21 .",
    "thus the density @xmath5 in @xmath64 is related to the density @xmath76 in @xmath69 by the equation @xmath77    ignoring the weight factor , the mapping is effective in showing the correspondence between the interacting and independent walkers picture .",
    "exact correspondence will imply that @xmath4 or @xmath55 ( with @xmath65 ) would be equal to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , when dynamics @xmath65 is used .",
    "this can happen if the dynamical rule @xmath65 applied to @xmath64 leads to states which when mapped to @xmath69 will correspond exactly to the states obtained by applying @xmath68 on @xmath67 ( with the same weightage ) .",
    "we have verified that this is true for configurations in which either a walker is `` alone '' ( both neighbours are empty ) or has at most one walker in a neighbouring site . however , when three walkers occupy consecutive sites ( a `` three '' state ) , the dynamics @xmath65 gives rise to states which can not be obtained from @xmath67 applying @xmath68 on it .",
    "since the probability of having `` three '' states increases with @xmath5 , we expect that the results for independent and interacting walkers will differ at higher @xmath5 . for @xmath34",
    ", it is expected that @xmath4 and @xmath55 values would be equal to @xmath80 upto small @xmath5 which is exactly what we observe ( fig .",
    "3 ) ( time scales for @xmath34 being simply twice that of @xmath65 ) .",
    "obviously a `` three '' state can not be avoided if @xmath81 and this gives an upper bound where the disagreement will occur . in reality",
    ", such states occur at values of @xmath5 much below than this , even at about @xmath82 .",
    "we have verified that , if the three - states are forcibly ruled out in the simulation , the correspondence between the independent and interacting walkers remain valid upto @xmath83 .",
    "we would like to comment in this section that while for the interacting walkers system , @xmath4 behaves differently in the sp and rwp , no such difference exists for the independent walkers case .",
    "this is because there is no restriction on the movement of the walkers here even as the density becomes high .",
    "a subtle point relevant to the mapping needs to be mentioned here . at small @xmath5",
    "the results for @xmath64 and @xmath67 are equivalent indicating that the dynamical evolution of the walkers can be mapped to each other .",
    "it may still remain a question whether the persistence probability of @xmath64 can be mapped to that of @xmath69 .",
    "the question arises as the @xmath31 sites removed from the original system may either be persistent or non - persistent . on an average , however , the persistence of the two systems @xmath64 and @xmath69 will be same .",
    "this is because the average number of persistent sites removed is @xmath84 .",
    "thus in the mapped system , persistence probabilty is again @xmath85 .",
    "this justifies the correspondence of persistence in @xmath64 and @xmath69 and hence @xmath67 .",
    "the issue of equivalence of persistence requires special mention as persistence is not related to other dynamical behaviour of a system in general .",
    "the result for persistence probability in the spin picture and random walker picture differ in the interacting walkers case as in the sp there is a non - monotonicity in @xmath4 .",
    "this non - monotonic behaviour is clearly due to two features ( a ) presence of interacting walkers and ( b ) the dynamic quantity under consideration being persistence .",
    "point ( a ) is already discussed in the last section . regarding point ( b ) , it must be noted that the non - monotonicity appears when we assume that the initially occupied points are not visited , a fact which is relevant to persistence dynamics only . in this section",
    "we have discussed a few other dynamical phenomena in presence of interacting walkers .",
    "however , we find that none of these are accompanied by any non - monotonic behaviour of the relevant quantities appearing in them .    two dynamic quantities @xmath86 and @xmath87 representing fluctuations can be defined in the following way : we tag a random walker and calculate the fluctuation of its position @xmath88 at time @xmath1 with respect to its initial position @xmath89 and study its behavior with time ( fig . 5 ) .     is its initial position , @xmath88 its position at time @xmath1 and @xmath90 , the mean position averaged up to time @xmath1.,width=188 ]    precisely , @xmath86 is defined as @xmath91 in the second measure , we notice that the path of a walker can be viewed as an interface ( with no overhangs ) in 1 + 1 dimensions ( fig 5 ) .",
    "one can then measure the interface width at any time given by @xmath92 where @xmath90 is the mean value of the position @xmath93 at time t. it is known that for a single walker ( i.e. , @xmath94 in the thermodynamic limit ) @xmath95 with @xmath96 . here , we find @xmath97 with @xmath98 at long times for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite where the result @xmath99 has been derived exactly . in the present system",
    ", @xmath5 has a finite value and for the smallest value of @xmath5 shown in fig .",
    "6 , a crossover effect is noted , i.e. , the behavior at earlier time appears to be consistent with @xmath100 .",
    "this is because at small @xmath5 , the walker continues as a free walker for a considerable period of time and exhibits the corresponding behaviour .",
    "the behavior of @xmath101 with time @xmath1 has been studied for values of @xmath5 even smaller than 0.1 in smaller lattices and it appears that for any finite @xmath5 , however small , @xmath98 is valid at longer times always .",
    "we conclude that there is a transition point at @xmath94 for any @xmath102 , the random walker exponent is @xmath103 while for @xmath104 , it is 0.5 .",
    "the results for @xmath87 are consistent with the above observations .",
    "both @xmath86 , @xmath105 with @xmath99 independent of @xmath5 ( for @xmath106 ) , while @xmath107 depends on @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "7 , we plot @xmath108 against @xmath5 for both @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath108 decereases monotonically with @xmath5 and follows a rough exponential decrease as @xmath109 except for values very close to 1 , where one can expect anomalous behavior .",
    "we investigate the behavior of another quantity @xmath110 , which we define as the fluctuation of the distance @xmath111 between two neighbouring walkers at time @xmath1 with respect to its initial value @xmath112 .",
    "precisely , @xmath113 @xmath110 shows an initial increase with @xmath1 and reaches a time independent equilibrium value @xmath114 at larger times .",
    "this equilibrium value @xmath114 ( calculated from the mean value of the last 100 monte carlo steps ) , when plotted against @xmath5 , again shows a monotonic decay with @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "7 ) . hence , in contrast to the factor @xmath4 appearing in the persistence dynamics , we do not find non - monotonic behavior in the factors appearing in the other dynamical features .",
    "in summary , we have considered the dynamics of @xmath31 mutually avoiding random walkers on a one dimensional chain of length @xmath21 which simulates the quenching dynamics in the annni model for a particular value of @xmath115 . for this value of @xmath5",
    ", we verify that the survival probability @xmath0 which corresponds to the persistence probability in the annni model follows a stretched exponential behavior consistent with the annni model dynamics .",
    "we also observe very good quantitative agreement for the exponent @xmath3 and slope @xmath4 . on generalising the value of @xmath5 , we find that the behavior @xmath116 is valid for all @xmath5 with @xmath3 showing a universal value of @xmath117 .    observing that the time dependence in @xmath0 is identical to that in @xmath61 ( the corresponding quantity in presence of non - interacting walkers ) for all @xmath5",
    ", we have shown that a mapping between the two indeed exist which remains exact for small @xmath5 as far as the behaviour of @xmath4 is concerned .",
    "we have considered two different pictures while computing the persistence probability ; in the spin ( random walker ) picture the sites initially occupied by the walkers are assumed to be not visited ( visited ) and the behaviour of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 is sensitive to this difference . in the sp , it has a non - monotonic behaviour .",
    "such non - monotonic behaviour emerges in the case of interacting walkers only .",
    "however , when other dynamical phenomena in presence of interacting walkers are studied , no such non - monotonic behaviour is found .",
    "thus we find that the persistence dynamics in a system with a finite density of mutually avoiding random walkers calculated in terms of the fraction of sites unvisited till time @xmath1 , shows a unique behavior compared to other dynamical quantities .",
    "this again supports the fact that persistence is a phenomenon which can not be directly connected to other dynamical features of a system .",
