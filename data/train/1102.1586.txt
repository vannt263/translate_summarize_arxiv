    "metallicity is one of the few progenitor attributes that can affect the luminosity of type ia supernovae ( snia ) , with important consequences for their use as cosmological standard candles @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite analysed the metallicity as a source of dispersion in the light - curve width - luminosity relationship and found that deriving supernova luminosities from light curve shapes without accounting for the supernova metallicity might lead to systematic errors of up to 0.5 mag . from an observational point of view",
    ", the dependence of snia luminosities on metallicity might originate a systematic error of @xmath5% in the measurement of the dark energy equation of state @xmath6 @xcite , comparable to the current statistical uncertainties . @xcite proposed to include the host properties ( galaxy mass and metallicity ) into the snia light - curve fitters in order to correct for these systematic errors .    up to now , attempts to measure the metallicity directly from supernova observations have been scarce and their results uncertain @xcite .",
    "measuring the metallicity , @xmath7 , from the x - ray emission of supernova remnants is a promising alternative but as yet has been only applied to a single supernova @xcite , although there are prospects to extend this analysis to further remnants @xcite .",
    "an alternative venue is to estimate the supernova metallicity as the mean @xmath7 of its environment @xcite - this can be done for statistically significant samples of sne in nearby galaxies by taking advantage of the long evolutionary timescales of their supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "excluding these studies based on individual objects or supernova remnants , the vast majority of our knowledge about the metallicity of type ia sn progenitors has been assembled by measuring the bulk properties of their _ entire _ host galaxies .",
    "@xcite looked for galactic age or metal content correlations with snia luminosity in star - forming hosts , but their results were ambiguous .",
    "@xcite studied the correlations between snia properties and galaxy metallicity or , more precisely , its oxygen abundance as determined from emission lines in the integrated spectra of star - forming hosts .",
    "@xcite looked for systematic trends of snia uv spectra with metallicity of the host galaxy , and found that the spectral variations were much larger than predicted by theoretical models .",
    "@xcite studied the metallicity of all the star - forming galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) catalogue with redshifts in the range @xmath8 that hosted sne of some kind and noted that snia occur in a wide range of metallicities , as low as 0.25 solar .",
    "@xcite , using data from the sdss and supernova survey concluded that prompt snia are more luminous in metal - poor systems . @xcite and",
    "@xcite , using different methodologies to estimate the metallicity of snia hosts , arrived to opposite conclusions with respect to the dependence of supernova luminosity on @xmath7 , although these discrepancies might have been solved recently @xcite .",
    "we note that most of the previous work has focused on comparisons between the empirical observationally - determined relationship between the _ metallicity of hosts _ and their snia luminosities on the one hand ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretical predictions of correlations between the _ supernova metallicity _ and luminosity on the other hand ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus assuming implicitly that both metallicities are somehow tied .    estimating the metallicity of an entire galaxy is a complex task , involving many different observational and theoretical challenges . on the observational side ,",
    "different tracers exist for both gas - phase and stellar metallicities , each with their own advantages and disadvantages @xcite . on the theoretical side , complex modelling of the observations",
    "is often required to arrive at a numerical estimate of the metallicity , which introduces biases and uncertainties that depend on the specific technique used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite measured the host metallicity from absorption lines of fe at two wavelengths , thus testing the gas - phase in early - type galaxies , using single - age single - metallicity stellar population models .",
    "then , to derive metallicity , they assumed solar elemental ratios in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite determined the host metallicity indirectly . in a first step",
    ", they determined the host mass from spectral energy distribution fits to galaxy photometry .",
    "next , they applied the well - known mass - metallicity relationship @xcite , also valid for the gas - phase .",
    "the @xcite mass - metallicity relationship was determined in turn through measures of the nebular emission lines of oxygen in star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite compared the stellar metallicities to those of the gas - phase ( measured through the oxygen abundance ) for several thousand galaxies in the sdss .",
    "they found that the relationship between both metallicities is non - linear , with a shallower than linear dependence of the gas - phase oxygen abundance on the stellar metallicity , and a large scatter of data points .",
    "the question we want to address in this work is : what is the relationship between the metallicity of a snia and that of its host galaxy ? given the complexity of the problem we want to address it from a statistical point of view , aiming to determine a distribution function for the difference of metallicities between the supernova and its host .",
    "our approach is based on calculations of galactic chemical evolution together with the evolution of the supernova rate . in order",
    "to understand which the best estimators of snia metallicity are we study the correlations between snia metallicity and different observational tracers of host metallicity : fe vs. o in the gas - phase and stellar vs. gas - phase metallicity . in order to keep simplicity",
    ", we use homogeneous one - zone galactic chemical evolution models , disregarding spatial variations within each galaxy . taking into account the spatial variations of metallicity would increase the scatter and corrections modelled in this paper .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ models ] , we describe the theoretical framework we adopt in order to derive the statistical properties of the metallicities of snia compared to that of their host galaxies . in the next section",
    ", we analyse the results , with particular emphasis on the reliability of different host metallicity measures as estimators of snia metallicity . among the tracers that we consider , we rank highest the measure of snia metallicity through the gas - phase metallicity of its host .",

    "it turns out that the metallicity of an average snia is closer to that of its host if the dtd peaks at small time delays , as the dtd of @xcite , than if the snia rate follows the rate of formation of white dwarfs , as proposed by @xcite . in section  [ catalogs ]",
    "we explore the possibility of using current galactic catalogues , such as sdss and vespa , to derive the metallicity distribution function of snia .",
    "finally , in section  [ toconclude ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we define the metallicity probability density of snia , @xmath9 as the probability that a snia comes from a progenitor whose metallicity logarithm differs from the logarithm of its host metallicity , @xmath0 , in :    @xmath10    similarly , we define the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of snia as the cumulative metallicity probability , i.e. the probability that the difference between the logarithm of the metallicity of the snia progenitor and that of the host is smaller than @xmath3 ( note that this means @xmath3 larger in absolute value in the usual case that the snia metallicity is smaller than the host s one ) ,    @xmath11    we give additional details about the procedure we use to compute @xmath12 at the end of section  [ sectinf ] .",
    "we further define the `` metallicity correction '' , @xmath13 , as the mean value of @xmath3 , i.e. :    @xmath14    the present rate of snia explosions in a given host , @xmath15 , is the convolution over time of the star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath16 , and the dtd , @xmath17 :    @xmath18    the probability that a snia that explodes now ( at time @xmath19 ) comes from a progenitor born at time @xmath20 is :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the time spanned since progenitor birth to the moment the host is being observed , which we will call look - back time , and @xmath19 is the cosmic time .",
    "finally , the knowledge of @xmath23 vs. time and the metallicity evolution , @xmath24 , allows to construct the mdf of snia .",
    "we have used two different prescriptions for the dtd : those of @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * in the following m10b ) . as we will show later in section  [ sectdtd ] ,",

    "we explore the sensitivity of our results to other choices for the imf @xcite and the stellar lifetime law @xcite .",

    "we assume that the mass lost by the star during its hydrostatic evolution returns to the ism the same metal fraction with which the star was born .",
    "the yield tables of @xcite provide the ejected mass of each element , @xmath38 , as a function of the star mass , @xmath39 , and metallicity , @xmath40 : @xmath41 . in most of our calculations we interpolate the yields as a function of metallicity",
    ", according to the metallicity of the ism at the time of stellar birth . as in @xcite , we adopt a fraction of hypernovas @xmath42 .    in order to simplify ,",

    "we integrate the yields between a minimum mass of 10  m@xmath34 and a maximum mass of @xmath35  m@xmath34 , thus obtaining a mean yield , @xmath43 . in this work ,",

    "we have calculated the chemical evolution of homogeneous galaxy models together with the evolution of the supernova rates in order to evaluate the metallicity distribution function of snia , @xmath2 , i.e. the probability that the logarithm of the metallicity of a snia exploding now differs in less than @xmath3 from that of its host .",
    "we have analysed several model galaxies aimed to represent from active to passive galaxies , including dwarf galaxies prone to experience supernova driven outflows .",
    "our results show a remarkable degree of coincidence ( in an statistical sense ) between the mean @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath1 in active galaxy models is quite small , meaning that @xmath0 is a quite good estimator of the supernova metallicity , while passive galaxies present a larger dispersion .",
    "we have devised a procedure to correct the difference in metallicity between snia and their hosts ( sect .",
    "[ sectstat ] ) , based on a linear fit given in fig .  [ figziap ] .",
    "these results are insensitive to the choice of imf , stellar lifetime and stellar yields , within the ranges we have explored .",
    "in contrast , the delay time distribution of snia remains one of the main ingredients influencing the difference of metallicity between snia and their hosts .",
    "we have discussed the use of different metallicity indicators ( fe vs. o , gas - phase metallicity vs. stellar metallicity ) . using o ( assuming its evolution is representative of that of the cno group ) as a metallicity measure for late - type galaxies does not change appreciable the metallicity correction with respect to using fe ( assuming its evolution is representative of that of all metals ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the metallicity correction for early - type galaxies ( @xmath180  gyr ) is quite different for o than for fe . on the other hand ,",
    "the metallicities of snia are much better represented by those of the gas - phase than by the mean stellar metallicities .",
    "thus , when possible , it is advisable to measure the host metallicity through that of its gas - phase .    finally , the results of the application of our formalism to a galactic catalogue ( vespa ) suggest that snia come , in average , from smaller metallicity progenitors both at low redshifts and in galaxies with large star - formation activity",
    ". the paucity of metallicities used in the original stellar - population synthesis models used in the construction of the galactic catalogue does not allow us to build a significant mdf of snia based on the galactic histories stored in the database .",
    "however , in spite of the large uncertainty in the metallicity derived from the catalogue , the gross trends of @xmath4 vs. @xmath0 obtained from vespa for different galaxy types are roughly consistent with our theoretical estimates .",
    "the derivation of improved , observationally based , mdf will be possible in the future if the ssp models include further refinements in their grid of metallicities .",
    "one of the main drawbacks of our approach is the use of homogeneous one - zone galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "actual galaxies are heterogeneous , and radial gradients of chemical composition are routinely measured within them .",
    "a possible improvement of our model would be to divide the galaxy in several non - interacting shells as in , e.g. , @xcite , then computing the galactic mdf accounting for the probability that a snia originates in each shell . then",
    ", however , a complication would arise when comparing to observations of far away galaxies for which there is no possibility of measuring the metallicity gradient : what is the meaning of _ the _ galaxy metallicity in a context where each independent shell has its own chemical history ?",
    "what is clear is that the derived mdf of snia would be characterized by a larger dispersion than the mdf we have obtained . in some sense ,",
    "the true mdf of snia reflects a double dependence : in space , i.e. the position of the snia progenitor within its host galaxy , and in time , i.e. the moment in the galactic history when the progenitor was born .",
    "it is just this last dependence what we have studied in the present work .",
