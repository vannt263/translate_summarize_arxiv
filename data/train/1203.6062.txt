    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are thought to inhabit the central regions of nearly all massive galaxies and have properties well - correlated with those of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the direction of the causal link between smbh and host galaxy properties remains unclear , but the existence of such a correlation implies an intimate connection between the physics of smbh growth and galaxy formation , spanning a factor of at least @xmath0 in length scale from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "quasars came to astronomers attention due to their enormous electromagnetic output .",
    "bright active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emit as much as @xmath3 over the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "a significant amount of careful work has been performed to study the physical effects of this extraordinary outpouring of electromagnetic energy and momentum on the material in the immediate vicinity of the agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result we are beginning to understand the radiation driven broad - line winds emerging from discs around the central smbhs .",
    "however , relatively little work has been done regarding the radiative effects on the surrounding galaxy .",
    "there has been intense theoretical interest in the ability of agn to affect the star formation histories and observed colors of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the relationships between star formation , and agn activity , galaxy mergers , and secular processes have turned out to be complex and the parameter space is not yet fully mapped .",
    "what is clear is that gas added to the central regions of galaxies will induce a central star burst and an agn flare - up , but the triggering mechanism remains uncertain .",
    "although the use of numerical simulations to study the interactions between black holes and galaxies has a long history ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , work by @xcite and @xcite set off an explosion of theoretical work .",
    "they studied the simplest reasonable fully specified model of black hole fueling and agn feedback in the context of a major mergers of gas - rich spiral galaxies and found that the agn has a profound effect on the gas dynamics and star formation history in the merger remnant .    during the combined agn / starburst phase ,",
    "analytical investigations by @xcite and @xcite have shown the importance of radiative forces on dust .",
    "subsequent numerical work @xcite has verified that if the central @xmath4 100 pc of galaxies are assumed to have optical depths of 10 to 25 in the infrared , due to dust opacity , then radiative forces on dust have dramatic dynamical consequences in the context of merging galaxies .",
    "as the investigations have become more detailed and accurate , it has become increasingly necessary to perform the radiative computations in a more rigorous fashion , carefully determining both the energy and momentum input into the ambient gas .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to outline some of the principles and techniques that may be used for this task .",
    "our goal is to develop a numerical method to self - consistently solve the radiative transfer problem in galaxies in the presence of dust and radiation produced by stars and agn .",
    "that is , we would like to solve for the specific intensity of the radiation field for a given distribution of radiation sources in the presence of scattering and absorbing media , and subsequently use the specific intensity to compute the forces on the scattering / absorbing media .",
    "studies of smbh fueling and agn feedback performed to date have either ignored radiative effects or else assumed a particular form of the photon field which is then used to compute forces on the gas .    although it would be ideal to obtain a perfect solution for the radiation field in all cases , we will settle for a method that gives the correct asymptotic behavior in all relevant limits and interpolates reasonably between the limits .",
    "it should respect global conservation laws for energy and momentum .",
    "it must not be overwhelmingly demanding in terms of algorithmic complexity or computational resources .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : previous - work ] we summarize previous theoretical work on agn feedback as well as some recent observational results . in section [ sec : radiative - transfer ]",
    "we discuss the radiative transport equation in the context of the present problem .",
    "we describe the physics behind it , its most important properties , and the different approaches that can be used for the numerical solution . in section [ sec : hydro - simulations ]",
    "we describe the physics implemented in a two - dimensional hydrodynamical code designed to study black hole fueling and radiative feedback from agn and star formation in the context of early - type galaxies . in section [ sec : results ] we present the main results of the simulations . finally in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "it has long been known that the bulk of the matter that enters black holes over the history of the universe does so via radiatively efficient accretion @xcite .",
    "the resulting photons are the clearest observational indication that smbh accretion is taking place .",
    "there is a prodigious amount of energy and momentum available during eddington - limited bursts consequent to accretion , certainly enough to have a profound effect on the structure and dynamics of the interstellar medium .",
    "many agn are observed to have broad absorption lines indicating strong outflows .",
    "several physical processes operating near the smbh could plausibly launch these winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they go under the heading of mechanical feedback regardless of the details of their origin @xcite .",
    "they are thought to be somewhat collimated and are thus only observed in 1/4 to 1/2 of all bright agn .",
    "recently , quantitative estimates of the kinetic energy in these outflows have become available @xcite and indicate that they contain 0.1 - 1% of the energy in the radiative component of the agn output .",
    "this mechanical energy can couple to the ism much more efficiently than the agn photons , making this an attractive mechanism for agn feedback .",
    "however , there are significant observational uncertainties in these kinetic wind energy estimates , the studies have only been carried out for a few objects , and there is no global constraint analogous to the @xcite argument that allows an estimate of the global mean efficiency of energy conversion to kinetic winds in agn . if the @xcite estimate of the kinetic luminosity is correct and we assume all of the mechanical energy and momentum is effectively deposited into the ism , then mechanical feedback will dominate over radiative feedback for column densities less than @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "many groups have carried out substantially similar studies of agn feedback in the context of galaxy mergers where the black hole accretion rate is given by the smaller of the estimated bondi rate and the eddington rate , while the agn feedback is assumed to be purely thermal energy injected in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "this is the basic model developed by @xcite and @xcite and applied extensively to compare with observations of the quasar luminosity function , galaxy colors , and more ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same basic model was also used by @xcite , and all authors found that agn feedback has a dramatic effect on galaxies provided that 5% of the bolometric agn output is transformed into thermal energy within 100 pc of the black hole by mechanical winds operating on smaller scales .",
    "however , observations of gas dynamics near agn have indicated that the actual efficiencies are a factor of 5 to 50 smaller than the value usually used in many of these simulations @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have carried out careful studies of the underlying numerical and physical assumptions that go into this feedback model , the latter paper finding that including the radial momentum of the agn ejecta in the calculation dramatically increases the efficiency of mechanical feedback .",
    "@xcite developed a model of agn involving anisotropic injection of kinetic energy on scales similar to the resolution of the simulation .",
    "they implemented this model in the adaptive - mesh - refinement code ramses @xcite and studied the implications of this feedback model on the properties of black holes and galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations a resolution of approximately one kiloparsec .",
    "@xcite performed simulations of the evolution of the ism of an elliptical galaxy in the presence of agn feedback similar to that of @xcite . in terms of the galaxy model and the treatment of stellar evolution and mass loss ,",
    "the simulations are substantially similar to those presented here .",
    "the differences include the fact that the @xcite simulations are three dimensional rather than two dimensional , have much lower spatial resolution ( @xmath7 rather than @xmath8 , and include feedback _ only _ via anisotropic injection of kinetic energy , rather than the more comprehensive feedback model presented here .",
    "@xcite found that mechanical feedback efficiencies in the range of those observed by @xcite and @xcite were sufficient to limit black hole growth , balance atomic cooling , and lead to observationally reasonable gas density and temperature profiles , in substantial agreement with the conclusions of @xcite , @xcite , and other studies .",
    "the observational studies of @xcite and @xcite indicate that this form of mechanical feedback only uses a small fraction of the available energy .",
    "this motivates the study of other forms of radiative feedback .",
    "it is well - known that the photons couple to the ism weakly if only the small thompson cross section is considered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "of the momentum available , only a fraction @xmath9 ( the optical depth to electron scattering ) couples to the ism , while there is no additional energy transfer to the gas in the case of pure thompson scattering of photons having @xmath10 .",
    "only a small fraction of agn are known to be optically thick to compton scattering , although studies of the x - ray background indicate that compton - thick agn may be common at high redshift @xcite .",
    "x - rays couple more strongly than lower energy photons @xcite due to both inverse compton effects and coupling with resonant metal lines .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath11 relation @xcite has been construed as evidence that black holes regulate their growth via momentum - driven winds @xcite .",
    "radiation also couples to the ism through scattering / absorption by dust grains as well as atomic resonance lines .",
    "the cross section for dust absorption in the uv for solar metallicity gas with a dust / gas ratio typical of the milky way can be 3500 times the electron scattering cross section @xcite , while that for resonance lines can be the same or greater @xcite .",
    "this means that radiative feedback due to line or dust absorption can provide more energy and momentum than mechanical feedback for column densities as low as @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the potential importance of radiative momentum feedback has been known for some time ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) , but the particular importance of dust in the context of agn and starbursts was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite model the effect of radiation pressure acting on dust at radii large compared to the black hole but small compared to the galaxy . note that while the physical process mediating the interaction between the smbh and the ism is different from the mechanical model of @xcite , the photon momentum is converted to hydrodynamic motion on scales smaller than the resolution of the simulation ( @xmath14 pc ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the important effects of x - ray heating and @xcite and collaborators have incorporated all of the standard electromagnetic processes into their one - dimensional treatments of the cooling flow initiated agn outbursts (;",
    "these investigations represent a different viewpoint from the `` conventional '' view that agn are associated with mergers . here , the agn activity attributed to the reprocessing of gas lost by the evolving stellar population of an isolated and `` passively '' evolving early - type galaxy . in section [ sec : observations ] we comment on recent observations that bear on this point .",
    "recently @xcite have added an improved treatment of dust creation and destruction as well as a calculation of the dust temperature to these one - dimensional models .",
    "feedback in the @xcite simulations is implemented via a force on the gas assuming that there is a fixed optical depth to ir photon scattering by dust at all times ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "no self - consistent solution for the radiation field is sought .",
    "the radiative force is applied over one resolution element near the black hole , so , although the physical model posits a radiative origin for the computed forces , in implementation their algorithm bears some resemblance to mechanical feedback schemes in that it is purely local and the photons do not exert forces over macroscopic distances in the simulation .",
    "@xcite used the same physical model described in @xcite and ( with the exception of the radiative forces on dust ) to run two - dimensional simulations of smbh fueling and agn feedback .",
    "the present work extends @xcite to include radiative forces on dust grains .",
    "we seek to carry out the radiative transfer calculation due to photon absorption and scattering by dust in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "@xcite and @xcite carried out simulations of black hole fueling and agn feedback during galaxy mergers and found that the addition of x - ray heating by the agn allowed the black hole to regulate its own growth by keeping its immediate vicinity hot without necessarily heating the majority of the gas in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite used cosmological smoothed - particle - hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations with a simple treatment of x - ray photons from the agn .",
    "@xcite performed adaptive - mesh simulations of galaxy mergers reaching a resolution of 15 pc .",
    "the simulations tracked mechanical feedback in the form of a collimated outflow generated near the black hole as well as radiative feedback in the form of x - rays generated by the agn .",
    "the x - rays transferred energy and momentum to the surrounding gas , via by a three - dimensional monte carlo ray tracing algorithm .",
    "several efforts have focused on understanding angular momentum transport in the absence of feedback .",
    "this eases one of the severe computational constraints in the problem , since it is feedback that generates high gas temperatures and large gas velocities , necessitating very short simulation time steps and therefore very large computational costs per simulation .",
    "@xcite used adaptive - mesh cosmological simulations to examine gas transport from cosmological scales to @xmath4 1 pc from the black hole .",
    "@xcite carried out nested zoom - in simulations of the central regions of a galaxy undergoing a major merger .",
    "both groups concluded that the mutual gravitational torques exerted by clumps of gas were sufficient to transfer angular momentum away from the central regions and permit accretion , and that the scale - free nature of gravity allowed the process to proceed in a nested fashion through all scales to the presumed black hole accretion disk .",
    "it is very attractive to split the problem of black hole fueling and agn feedback into a fueling part and a feedback part .",
    "however , one would expect gas clumpiness to be dramatically reduced if agn are able to heat the ism significantly , which would in turn shut down the angular momentum transfer process that these authors envision .",
    "if the gas clumps are shielded from the agn photons by a central dusty torus , or if the clumps of gas are self - shielding , then the process may continue to operate in spite of agn feedback .",
    "as high - resolution simulation efforts that resolve the bondi radius become more common , technical details of the numerical solution become important . @xcite",
    "have performed a detailed study of the numerical and physical aspects of simulating bondi accretion using sph in the presence of heating by a central black hole over scales of 0.1 to 200 pc .",
    "they conclude that typical formulations of the artificial viscosity term typically used in sph can cause excessive heating near the inner boundary of the simulation .",
    "@xcite have studied the radiation hydrodynamics of the inner few parsecs of galaxies in the presence of dust in the the flux - limited diffusion approximation .",
    "they show that the dusty torus around agn is plausibly supported by radiation pressure on dust in an outflowing wind .",
    "they are interested in smaller physical scales than presently concern us , and they are only interested in the limit of large optical depths to scattering by dust in the infrared .",
    "however , there is significant overlap in the basic physics between their work and the present paper .",
    "the observational situation regarding the links between black hole growth , star formation , and mergers has been somewhat confused , although it seems that a preponderance of evidence is now indicating that , although mergers may trigger agn , the majority of agn are _ not _ triggered by mergers .",
    "@xcite used a combination of x - ray data , space - based optical data , and ground - based optical data , all part of the aegis survey @xcite , to conclude that x - ray selected agn preferentially reside in early - type galaxies and that although the x - ray selected agn were more often members of close pairs , the companion was usually undisturbed .",
    "this was interpreted as evidence against interactions triggering agn .    using sloan digital sky survey data",
    ", @xcite found a strong correlation between close galaxy pairs and galactic star formation , but _ no _ correlation between between close pairs and agn activity .",
    "@xcite conducted a similar study and found superficially similar correlations , but based on their results connecting galaxy color to stellar population age @xcite argued that the lack of agn with close companions was due to a delay between the final merger and the onset of agn activity .",
    "@xcite have found that close pairs tend to have agn activity , but that agn do not have an elevated close companion rate .",
    "they argue that mergers do indeed cause agn activity , but that the majority of agn are caused by other , presumably secular processes .",
    "@xcite found that agn activity is correlated with _",
    "star formation ( within @xmath16100 pc ) , but _ not _ with _ global _ star formation on kiloparsec scales .",
    "@xcite used space - based optical and x - ray data taken as part of the candels survey @xcite to conclude that there is little difference between x - ray selected agn and quiescent galaxies in terms of colors and stellar populations out to a redshift of three , arguing against a scenario where a significant fraction of agn are triggered by mergers . as part of the same survey ,",
    "@xcite concluded that x - ray selected agn are not morphologically different from a mass - matched sample of quiescent galaxies .",
    "in this section , we develop a method of treating the radiative forces forces on the ism gas in a galaxy . our goal is to arrive at an algorithm that gives the correct behavior in the many asymptotic limits required by the physical problem at hand .",
    "first we discuss the astrophysical requirements that motivate some of the choices we have made in defining the method . in the present work we are primarily concerned with radiative forces on dust grains , but the method works for any source of isotropic scattering or absorption opacity .",
    "more precisely , we derive three related algorithms for solving the radiative transfer equation . all of them arise from developing a set of moment equations for the specific intensity . for each method",
    ", we derive set of differential equations , the solution of which give the mean intensity and net flux of the photon field .    the first method ( section [ sec : mathematical - treatment ] )",
    "gives a boundary - value problem where the physical content of the set of differential equations is quite transparent .",
    "however , closing the set of differential equations in this method requires us to rely rather heavily on our physical intuition about the solution .    the second method ( appendix [ sec : complex - rxfer ] ) also gives boundary - value problem and is more aesthetically pleasing in a formal mathematical sense because the closure relation is derived along with the set of differential equations  it does not require a physically motivated guess .",
    "the cost an additional differential equation to solve and the fact that the physical content of the equations is somewhat more opaque compared to the first method .",
    "the third method ( appendix [ sec : simplified - rxfer ] ) is an attempt to capture the essential behavior of the system while reformulating it as an initial value problem .",
    "the reason for this is that it is vastly simpler to efficiently and robustly obtain the numerical solution to an initial value problem",
    ".    note that in this work we use the first of these three methods and present the other two for reference and for future work .",
    "all three of the algorithms are self - consistent in the sense that we first solve for the photon field and then learn from this solution whether the radiation field is nearly isotropic ( like the interior of a star ) or highly directed ( like a point source ) , whether the energy is carried by uv , optical , or ir photons , and so on .",
    "we do not assume a priori that the system is in any particular asymptotic limit of the radiative transfer equation .",
    "we neglect angular force terms and although we use spherical symmetry to derive the differential equations , we argue in section [ sec : ray - by - ray ] that the method can be used with good results even in the case where the system is not spherically symmetric .      over their lifetimes",
    ", galaxies explore essentially all of the asymptotic limits of the radiative transfer equation .",
    "most of the time , most lines of sight are optically thin to radiation and the central smbh is not accreting significantly , so the radiation field within the galaxy is nearly isotropic and produced by a spatially distributed source ( the stars themselves ) .",
    "however , most galaxies undergo brief periods of intense smbh accretion , during which time the radiation field is dominated by the central point source and is _ not _ isotropic . during these times",
    ", most lines of sight remain optically thin , but a few lines of sight pass through the central dusty torus which is highly optically thick to uv / optical photons .",
    "furthermore , many galaxies probably have spent time in a lirg / ulirg state involving intense bursts of star formation with a nearly spherical , highly optically thick ism in the central regions . in this case",
    ", the radiation field may be sourced primarily by the central point source or the distributed stars , and in either case repeated scattering and absorption of uv and optical photons make the radiation field tend toward isotropy .",
    "overall , the galaxy does not spend much time in this highly optically thick state , but interesting and important things are happening during that time .",
    "it is crucial to note here that all of the energy absorbed in the uv / optical bands must be re - emitted as long - wavelength photons , because to neglect the re - emission is to ignore energy and momentum conservation . in particular , ulirgs are optically thick even to electron scattering over essentially all lines of sight , so the diffusion of the reprocessed ir photons can have a significant impact on the state of the gas in the galaxy @xcite .    in the optically thin case , the radiation field is highly directed in the region where the point source dominates .",
    "this region always exists at sufficiently small radii for a true point source . if and when the stellar light starts to dominate the radiation field , it becomes nearly isotropic for radii within the region that is producing the bulk of the photons . for significantly larger radii ,",
    "the radiation field again becomes directed as the photons emerge from the galaxy on nearly radial paths heading toward infinity .",
    "if the ism is optically thick to scattering , the radiation field quickly becomes isotropic even if the photons come from a central point source . in the uv and optical part of the spectrum ,",
    "the opacities to scattering and absorption due to dust are of the same order of magnitude . typically the scattering opacity is less than the absorption opacity @xcite , in which case the primary effect of scattering is to make the radiation field tend toward isotropy , rather than trapping photons so that they diffuse out of the galaxy .",
    "therefore in adopting a closure relation we will assume that the radiation field becomes nearly isotropic ( although still maintaining a net outward flux ) when the optical depth to scattering _ or _ absorption is greater than unity .",
    "if the scattering opacity is _ much smaller _ than the absorption opacity , this is incorrect : a highly directed radiation field from a point source is _ always _ highly directed even after many ( absorption ) optical depths .",
    "however , for realistic dust properties the scattering and absorption opacities are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "if a uv or optical photon is absorbed rather than scattered , then the energy is reprocessed into the ir , but the energy is lost to the uv .",
    "thus absorption will not tend to change the angular character of the radiation field ( directed versus nearly isotropic ) .",
    "however , for declining density distributions , the column density @xmath17 is dominated by what is occurring at small radii , whereas the energy injected by stars , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the emissivity for stellar photons ) , is dominated by what happens at large radii unless the stellar distribution falls off as @xmath20 or faster .",
    "therefore , even if absorption dominates over scattering ( as it does in the uv ) , if the ism is optically thick , the central point source will quickly be diminished compared to the radiation produced by stars .",
    "radiative transfer is difficult in general , in part because of the high dimensionality of the problem .",
    "the quantities of interest are functions of spatial position , photon propagation direction , frequency , and time , giving seven dimensions in total .",
    "furthermore , the solution is subject to non - local effects : photons tend to leave a system via optically thin `` windows '' if they are available . a nearly spherical gas cloud with optical depth @xmath21 along most lines of sight and a few clear lines of sight comprising solid angle",
    "@xmath22 will trap photons roughly as though it had effective optical depth @xmath23 .",
    "that is , in order to effectively trap photons within an optically thick cloud , it is necessary to have a covering fraction of order @xmath24 or else the photons will leak out of optically thin `` holes . ''      using the physical insight provided by the discussion in section [ sec :",
    "astrophysical - preliminaries ] , we now seek a mathematical formulation of the problem that is not overwhelmingly computationally intensive and is correct ( or nearly so ) in each of the identified limits ( optically thin / thick , radiation field nearly isotropic / highly directed , dominated by distributed source / point source , and gas distribution nearly spherical / highly non - spherical ) .",
    "we must distinguish the variables specifying the photon propagation direction from spatial position ; to this end we stipulate that @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to spatial position while @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to photon propagation direction . without loss of generality , in the case of isotropic scattering , as we consider in our treatment , the frequency - integrated equation of radiative transfer is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance along the arbitrary direction of the ray , @xmath31 , @xmath27 is the angle between the ray propagation direction and the @xmath32 axis , @xmath28 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath33 is the specific intensity , @xmath34 is the mean intensity , @xmath35 is the gas density , @xmath36 is the cross section for absorption per unit mass , @xmath37 is the cross section for scattering per unit mass , and finally @xmath19 is the emissivity per unit solid angle @xcite .",
    "all quantities are functions of spatial position and time , suppressed above for brevity .    if we further adopt spherical symmetry , i.e. , all quantities are independent of spatial position @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then eq . ( [ eq : rxfer - general ] ) becomes @xmath38    here we seek a solution to this equation by taking moments in @xmath39 and integrating away the dependence of the photon field on propagation direction .",
    "the final ingredient is a physically reasonable closure relation to terminate the set of moment equations , to be discussed below .",
    "note that although we write the radiative transfer equation in spherical form , the numerical method we outline does _ not _ require spherical symmetry . the gas density , opacities , and photon field may vary as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "further details including the method by which this is accomplished as well as advantages and disadvantages of our formulation are discussed in section [ sec : ray - by - ray ] .",
    "the considerations in section [ sec : astrophysical - preliminaries ] can be summarized by the _ ansatz _ that the specific intensity to be composed of three terms : one isotropic , one mildly anisotropic , and one highly directed : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dirac delta function and the three coefficients ( which are functions of time and radial coordinate ) are adjusted as described below .",
    "incorporating the last term ( with @xmath42 ) permits us to allow for phases when the central point - like quasar dominates the radiation field and to correctly treat the photon field far outside of the galaxy where the specific intensity resembles that of a point source .",
    "note that if we were to take @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity ] ) , then we would arrive at the eddington approximation , which is commonly adopted in stellar interiors .",
    "taking eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity ] ) as a generalization of the eddington approximation allows us to interpolate smoothly between the limits of a central point source and an optically thick situation .",
    "taking moments in @xmath39 of the specific intensity to remove the explicit dependence on the ray propagation direction gives : @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mean intensity , @xmath48 is the energy flux , and @xmath49 is the radiation pressure .",
    "we must find some physically plausible way to decide whether the radiation field is nearly isotropic ( in which case the standard eddington closure relation @xmath50 applies , where @xmath49 is the radiation pressure and @xmath51 is the energy density ) or highly directed ( in which case the flux is simply related to the zeroth and second moments of the specific intensity ) .    to find the appropriate equations , we take two moments of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rxfer ] ) in two different cases .",
    "first , when the radiation field is mildly anisotropic ( @xmath43 ) with the closure relation @xmath52 , yielding the differential equations for the photon field in the classic eddington approximation : @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 second , when the radiation field is highly directed ( @xmath55 ) with the closure relation @xmath56 , appropriate for a point source . in this case",
    "the equation for @xmath57 is the same and the equation for mean intensity becomes @xmath58 the first term on the right - hand side gives the expected @xmath59 fall - off of the mean intensity if the radiation field is primarily directed ( e.g. outside of the galaxy ) .",
    "we combine equations eqs .",
    "( [ inten - eddington ] ) and ( [ inten - point - source ] ) for @xmath60 by introducing the variable @xmath61 that interpolates between the optically thin ( radiation field like a point source ) and optically thick ( radiation field nearly isotropic ) cases .",
    "this gives : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 when the radiation field is nearly isotropic and @xmath65 when it is highly directed . in practice",
    ", we take @xmath61 as a function of position to be : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 evaluating @xmath61 as @xmath69 becomes very large or very small gives @xmath65 at the inner boundary ( near the agn ) and at the outer boundary ( far from the galaxy ) . if the ism is optically thick there will be some region in between where @xmath61 is nearly 0 .",
    "this choice expresses our expectation about where the radiation field should be primarily directed versus primarily isotropic .",
    "the factors of five in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thin - thick ] ) are chosen to ensure that the value of @xmath61 switches from the optically thin limit to the optically thick limit fairly quickly near optical depths of unity .",
    "the transition effectively occurs between optical depths of 0.8 and 1.2 .",
    "finally we specify the boundary conditions . as in the study of stellar interiors , our second order differential equation for @xmath70 requires two boundary conditions , one at the center and one at the outer surface . near the center of the simulation ,",
    "the outgoing luminosity is only that provided by the central point source , the agn .",
    "far from the galaxy , the radiation field is expected to again look like a point source as scattering / absorption become negligible and all of the photons leave the galaxy .",
    "the two natural boundary conditions are then @xmath71 and @xmath72    the force on the gas in a computational cell is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the optical depth ( scattering plus absorption ) of a given cell and @xmath75 is the area of the cell perpendicular to the radiation flux vector .",
    "we are primarily interested in what happens to the ism as a function of radius rather than angle .",
    "angular effects are important and it is of crucial importance to break spherical symmetry so that hydrodynamic instabilities such as convection and the rayleigh - taylor instability can operate .",
    "however , we are concerned mainly with _ whether _ gas makes it to small radii ( and accretes onto the black hole ) or to large radius ( and escapes the galaxy ) , not _ where _ on the sphere the gas enters the smbh or leave the galaxy .",
    "thus we neglect all angular radiative forces and formulate the radiative transfer as occurring exclusively along rays from the center of the galaxy .",
    "similar approximations have been used in numerical simulations of photon and neutrino transport in supernovae for some time ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "one approach is to spherically average the matter distribution , solve for the radiation field , and then calculate forces on matter via eq .",
    "( [ eq : forces ] ) .",
    "another approach is to treat each ray as a separate problem , in which case all intensive quantities ( gas density , emissivity of stellar photons , etc ) are treated as though they obtained over the whole sphere .",
    "we found that the first approach has dramatic failure modes where it wildly overestimates the outward radial forces on the gas in certain situations .",
    "as an example , consider an optically thick cloud covering a small solid angle in an otherwise optically thin medium .",
    "in reality , uv photons deposit momentum in a thin layer at the surface of the cloud , and the total momentum imparted to the cloud depends on the solid angle of the cloud .",
    "however , spherically averaging the matter distribution may result in the ism becoming optically thin at the cloud radius , and the solution for the photon field will indicate that the uv flux is high throughout the cloud . in this case , essentially all of the dust grains in the cloud are able to absorb uv photons and the momentum imparted to the cloud will be wildly overestimated .    instead",
    ", treating each ray as a completely independent problem has much better behavior in the sense that when the algorithm makes an error in computing the force on a particular gas cell , fractional error tends to be of order unity rather than orders of magnitude . in the previous example , this method gives the correct force exerted by uv photons .",
    "for the ir photons , the method assumes that they must traverse the cloud on their way out of the galaxy , while in reality they would leave the system via the optically thin ambient medium .",
    "therefore the method makes a a fractional error of order the ir optical depth when computing the force .",
    "one drawback of the latter approach is that if a particular ray ( say , near the pole ) has deficient star formation compared to the rest of the galaxy , then the forces exerted by the stellar photons will be anemic compared to the true solution , where stars from near the midplane emit photons that help push on gas near the poles .",
    "therefore , we average source terms over a sphere before finding the solution to the radiative transfer equations on each ray .",
    "note that this method allows the radiation field to differ in an unlimited way from one ray to the next .",
    "this is expected for example in the uv where the scattering opacity is less than the absorption opacity , and the interior of an individual `` cloud '' along a line of sight can be shielded from the agn uv luminosity . however , in the ir we consider the absorption opacity to be zero , and it no longer makes sense that the radiation field could differ substantially on adjacent rays .",
    "therefore we also spherically average the ir source terms ( in particular ir generated by absorption of uv or optical ) before solving for the luminosity as a function of radius in the ir .",
    "the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation is complicated by the fact that one boundary condition is specified at @xmath76 while the other is specified at @xmath77 ( note eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , integration from either side requires a guess that must be refined .",
    "this is identical to the situation in treating the radiative transfer in stellar interiors .",
    "conceptually , this is simply because we know the central luminosity , but we do know know the _",
    "intensity _ of the radiation field near the center .",
    "if the scattering opacity is large , photons will build up in the galaxy forming a nearly isotropic radiation field until the gradient of the photon density is sufficient to drive photon diffusion out of the galaxy at the rate required to carry the specified luminosity .",
    "in fact , the numerical solution to the radiative transfer equation in stellar interiors is considerably simpler than in the present problem because within stars , one can exploit the fact that the plasma is everywhere close to local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the plasma is assumed to quickly thermalize any energy sources or sinks so that the plasma is well - described by a single temperature at any point . in galaxies , the photon field is not close the thermodynamic equilibrium and we must track energy as it is transferred from x - rays to uv photons and eventually to ir photons . treating stellar interiors in an analogous way would mean tracking each energy band of photons separately as the star s luminosity was transported through the plasma , from the primary mev photons produced by fusion reactions , to the uv photons that eventually emerge from the photosphere .    to find the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lum - rxfer ] ) and ( [ eq : inten ] ) subject to the correct boundary conditions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) , the `` shooting method '' with newton - raphson iteration @xcite works well up to optical depths of a few . beyond that , the absorbing gas acts as a very effective `` screen '' that hides conditions near the center of the simulation from those at the outer edge .",
    "this makes it very difficult to find the correct solution matching both boundary conditions at once .",
    "we would like to simulate agn feedback in galaxies with gas surface density up to compton - thick , implying an optical depth to dust absorption in the uv of several thousand .",
    "the shooting method is too unstable to use in this case .",
    "it is true that given such a large optical depth , very little of the primary uv radiation escapes the galaxy ; it comes out in the ir .",
    "however , it is incorrect to discard the primary uv radiation completely , or to immediately transfer it to the ir .",
    "while this would correctly give the emergent energy , the uv radiation can have a very large effect near the center of the galaxy before it is transferred to the ir .",
    "for for solar composition and dust / gas ratios , they can limit the accretion rate to @xmath78 .    at large optical depths , the more powerful `` relaxation '' iterative method @xcite is required to adjust the solution over the entire domain of integration while ensuring that the proper boundary conditions are met at both ends of the interval .",
    "newton s method is used to iterate over trial solutions to arrive at the solution to the differential equations , where the independent variables of the newton iteration are taken to be the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 at each spatial point .",
    "the method takes the coupling between variables at neighboring points into account , allowing the entire solution to be updated without overcompensating ( which the shooting method is prone to do ) .",
    "given a good initial guess for the iteration , the relaxation method finds a reasonably accurate solution even for very large optical depths .",
    "the initial guess is conveniently provided by the solution that pertained during the previous simulation time step .",
    "two additional numerical schemes are defined in appendicies .",
    "the method described in appendix [ sec : complex - rxfer ] allows one to avoid using the variable @xmath61 and its somewhat _ ad hoc _ definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thin - thick ] ) at a cost of one additional additional differential equation to solve and a somewhat more opaque relationship between the equations and their physical content .",
    "the algorithm described in appendix [ sec : simplified - rxfer ] is an attempt to preserve the basic physics of the method while transforming the system of differential equations from a boundary value problem to an initial value problem .",
    "this allows one to use a substantially simpler numerical method to obtain the solution .",
    "for the full simulations , we will use the 2d numerical code described in @xcite .",
    "the code implements sources and sinks of mass , energy and momentum relevant for an early - type galaxy including stellar mass loss from planetary nebulae , type 1a and type ii supernovae .",
    "a full description of the input physics can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we describe the simple treatment of dust creation and destruction used in the present work .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for a more complete implementation of dust physics applied to one dimensional models .",
    "the light crossing time of the galaxy is by far the shortest timescale in the system and therefore if the ism is optically thin , photons are considered to act instantaneously for the purpose of our simulation . when the ism becomes optically thick , the radiative diffusion time is @xmath81 where @xmath21 is the optical depth .",
    "typically the temperature of the ism is not far from the virial temperature of the galaxy , so that the dynamical time and the sound crossing time are nearly equal .",
    "the latter is @xmath82 thus the radiative diffusion time will be shorter than the dynamical time and sound crossing time as long as @xmath83 . for our purpose",
    "radiative diffusion takes place primarily in the ir , and the maximum optical depth in the ir is of order 10 .",
    "therefore the radiation field is considered to reach equilibrium instantaneously , and radiative forces are considered to act instantaneously .",
    "that is to say that we solve all of the radiation transfer equations assuming a steady state .",
    "we divide the radiative energy output of the agn into broad bands where the relevant physics is significantly different : ir ( below 1 ev ) , optical ( for our purposes , non - ionizing : 1 - 13 ev ) , uv including soft x - rays where the absorption cross - section is greater than the thompson cross - section ( 13 - 2000 ev ) , and hard x - rays where the interactions are dominated by compton scattering ( @xmath84 2 kev ) . the assumed division of the agn output into the different bands is given in table [ tab : bands ] .    .assumed unabsorbed qso energy output by band @xcite and dust opacities for solar metallicity gas with milky way dust - to - gas ratio expressed in terms of the electron scattering opacity , @xmath85 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the integral in eq .",
