    "the obtained spectrum contains four bands .",
    "it was shown that maxima of the spectral function forming the bands are of dissimilar origin in different regions of the brillouin zone  in its central part and at the periphery the maxima stem from the resonance denominator in the formula for the spectral function , while near the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone they originate from the strong frequency dependence of the irreducible part in the numerator of this formula . the obtained band structure and the shapes of the spectral function are close to those found in the monte carlo calculations .      99 m.  c.  gutzwiller , phys .",
