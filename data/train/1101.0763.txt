    "over the past 23 years , 143 pulsars have been discovered in 27 globular clusters ( gcs ) , the vast majority of which are true millisecond pulsars ( msps ) with @xmath5 .",
    "many of these msps are in exotic binary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this stands in stark contrast to the population of pulsars found in the galactic disk , which are dominated by isolated pulsars with longer spin periods and a small number of binary msps .",
    "these differences have been attributed to the high stellar densities in gc cores , where exchange interactions form mass - transferring binaries leading to the recycling of a `` dead '' pulsar .",
    "these exchange interactions are also responsible for the exotic binaries described above ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "the large number of exchange interactions in gcs can in turn be traced to the high stellar densities in cluster cores , and indeed , correlations between density and the number of neutron stars in gcs have been known for some time .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the core interaction rate , @xmath6 , is a good predictor of the number of low - mass x - ray binaries , which are thought to be the progenitor systems to many msps .",
    "the value of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance and accounts for flux losses , has been used to pick out the most promising clusters for pulsar searches with great success .",
    "terzan 5 @xcite and 47 tucanae @xcite are the two richest clusters for msps and have the highest value of @xmath7 .",
    "recent simulations also show a strong dependence on core density for the number of observable pulsars @xcite .    nonetheless , there are exceptions to this rule that have been known for some time .",
    "@xcite discovered two pulsars in the low density gcs m13 and m53 .",
    "subsequent searches uncovered a substantial population of msps in gcs with @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "the totals now stand at five msps in m5 @xcite , five in m13 @xcite , four in m3 @xcite , two in ngc  6749 @xcite , one in m53 @xcite , and one in m71 @xcite .",
    "these msps account for about 13% of all known gc pulsars , despite the clusters contributing only 3% to the total @xmath11 of all gcs with pulsars .",
    "however , most of these pulsars were discovered by @xcite using arecibo , and without the exquisite sensitivity of this telescope , only a handful of pulsars would have been found .",
    "shortly after @xcite announced their results , @xcite argued that pulsar formation in low density systems was enhanced relative to high density systems , finding @xmath12 ( though this came prior to many fruitful searches in higher density clusters ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that three - body encounters with primordial binaries could give rise to a small population of pulsars even in low - density gcs .",
    "we have searched ten clusters using the robert c.  byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "we selected gcs that had not been searched using the gbt , focusing primarily on clusters that had low central densities and large galactic latitudes ( to avoid oversubscribed lst ranges ) .",
    "five clusters ( ngc  288 , ngc  2298 , ngc  6981 , ngc  7089 , and pal  12 ) were searched using the parkes radio telescope @xcite , but we ensured that our searches were at least twice as sensitive . since eight of the clusters have @xmath13 , this a good sample of deeply searched low density systems .",
    "we have discovered one new binary msp in ngc  5986 , and we discuss the implications of non - detections in the other clusters .",
    "all our searches were carried out using the gbt and the green bank ultimate pulsar processor ( guppi ) back - end @xcite .",
    "observations were made at a central frequency of @xmath14 , with @xmath15 of bandwidth broken into 2048 frequency channels , although persistent radio frequency interference ( rfi ) reduces the usable bandwidth to @xmath16 .",
    "we used sampling times of @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "total system temperatures were typically @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "the contribution from the galactic background was estimated by scaling the values from @xcite to @xmath14 assuming a spectral index of @xmath21 , though this was usually @xmath22 except for clusters at very low galactic latitudes .",
    "the limiting flux density of each search was taken to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 accounts for digitization losses and @xmath25 is our limiting s / n .",
    "@xmath26 is the total sky and system temperature , @xmath27 is the telescope gain , @xmath28 is the number of summed polarizations , @xmath29 is the usable bandwidth , and @xmath30 is the integration time .",
    "@xmath31 is the pulse period and @xmath32 is the observed pulse width , which is a combination of the intrinsic pulse width , instrumental time resolution , and broadening of the pulse due to dispersive smearing and scattering .",
    "this calculation does not take into account sensitivity losses due to rfi or doppler smearing of the pulse due to binary acceleration .",
    "however , we observed very little rfi in our data , and since we performed acceleration searches ( see below ) , only pulsars in very tight binaries should have dropped below our detection threshold .",
    "integration times and approximate limiting flux densities can be found in table [ table : gcs ] , along with some other properties of each cluster .    to test the accuracy of our limiting flux density estimates , we calculated the integration time necessary to just detect the lone pulsar we discovered in ngc  5986 , and then blindly searched this portion of our original data .",
    "the pulsar was indeed detected with with an appropriate s / n",
    ". we are therefore confident that our reported limits are accurate .",
    "data were reduced using the ` presto ` software suite @xcite . after removing rfi ,",
    "de - dispersed time series were created , starting with a minimum dispersion measure ( dm ) of @xmath33 and increasing in steps of @xmath34 to twice the dm predicted by the ne2001 model @xcite .",
    "acceleration techniques were used to search for periodic signals from isolated and binary msps and single pulse searches were used to look for bright transient emission . to search for highly accelerated pulsars , we performed acceleration searches on @xmath35@xmath36 minute subsets of each observation .",
    "we searched up to a maximum acceleration of 800 fourier bins in all acceleration searches .",
    "candidate pulsars were visually inspected and grouped into likely pulsars or random noise and rfi .",
    "we were able to observe some clusters twice , which allowed us to confirm or reject candidate pulsars quickly .",
    "we discovered one new pulsar in ngc  5986 , j1546@xmath373747a , hereafter ngc  5986a ( figure [ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "the pulsar was discovered in our acceleration searches with an acceleration of @xmath38 fourier bins , or @xmath39 , indicating that it is in a binary system .",
    "we conducted three follow - up observations to determine the orbit of ngc  5986a and to search for more pulsars using guppi in a coherent de - dispersion mode at @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the pulsar was detected in all three follow - up observations .",
    "we searched the @xmath40 and @xmath14 observations , but found no new pulsars .",
    "the @xmath41 observations were heavily contaminated with rfi , making a blind search impractical .    while these observations are not sufficient to obtain a full timing solution for ngc  5986a , they have allowed us to accurately determine the orbital parameters ( see table [ table : ngc5986a ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sine ] ) .",
    "the orbit is circular , with a period of @xmath42 and projected semi - major axis of @xmath43 .",
    "the companion mass limit is @xmath2 assuming a pulsar mass of @xmath44 .",
    "given a distribution of orbital inclinations that is flat in @xmath45 , an edge - on orbit is statistically most likely , so the true companion mass is probably close to this limit .",
    "these binary characteristics are similar to those of msps with helium white dwarf companions that are found in both gcs and the galactic disk .",
    "a main - sequence companion seems unlikely , as such systems have only been found in dense gcs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we see no evidence for eclipses , although we lack coverage near conjunction when eclipses would be most likely .",
    "systems similar to ngc  5986a have been found in other gcs of comparable density .",
    "if a precise position can be measured through future pulsar timing , a search for an optical counterpart may be feasible .",
    "rough flux density estimates were obtained by assuming that the off - pulse rms noise levels are described by the radiometer equation , @xmath46 we find @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 at @xmath14 , @xmath50 , and @xmath40 , respectively , which yields a spectral index of @xmath51 , flatter than the canonical value of @xmath52 .",
    "we searched ten clusters for pulsars , five of which have @xmath53 , but found only one msp .",
    "this stands in contrast to previous surveys ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , hereafter ) that found several pulsars in low density clusters .",
    "we therefore consider what factors may have led to our null results .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] shows the approximate limiting luminosity of our searches , where @xmath54 , along with the @xmath55 pseudo - luminosities of pulsars with reliable flux density measurements from , scaled to @xmath14 using a spectral index of @xmath52 ( ngc  5986a is also shown ) .",
    "it is immediately obvious that were more sensitive than our searches .",
    "we can attribute this to two factors .",
    "the first is that all the gcs from had @xmath56 , with the exception of m53 ( @xmath57 ) . by comparison ,",
    "only two clusters in our survey have @xmath56 , while most have @xmath58 .",
    "the second factor is that were able to reach lower limiting flux densities using arecibo than we could with the gbt .    despite these factors ,",
    "3/10 of our searches should have been sensitive to the brightest @xmath59 of a population similar to the pulsars , and 8/10 of our searches should have been sensitive to the brightest two pulsars .",
    "furthermore , four out of five of the clusters with @xmath60 were among the five most sensitively searched gcs in our sample .",
    "in other words , we achieved good sensitivity in the most promising clusters .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : survey ] , we are confident that our limiting flux densities are accurate unless there are pulsars in extremely tight binaries . however , since used the same search procedure as we have , they suffered from the same bias , so we do not believe this is a good explanation for the lack of pulsars in our sample .",
    "while it is possible that some of the pulsars could have a steeper spectral index than the assumed value of @xmath52 , we would also expect some to have flatter spectra , making them easier to detect at @xmath14 .",
    "it therefore seems likely that most of the clusters we searched lack a bright msp .",
    "we now turn to the theoretical results of @xcite , who predict the number of neutron stars in different types of gcs through monte carlo simulations .",
    "they simulated a variety of clusters , including those with @xmath61 .",
    "we began by empirically fitting a simple exponential to the results of @xcite of the form @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and where @xmath65 is the number of pulsars formed per @xmath66 ( as per the @xcite simulations ) .",
    "we explored other functional forms but chose this one for its goodness of fit and simplicity .",
    "we then calculated the expected number of pulsars in our clusters based upon their central densities and masses .",
    "next , we calculated how many pulsars would lie above our limiting flux densities ( at @xmath67 ) , given a power - law distribution , @xmath68 .",
    "we assumed a maximum luminosity equal to the brightest cluster pulsars , ( about @xmath69 at @xmath14 ) and a minimum luminosity of @xmath70 ( obtained by scaling the typically assumed lower limit of @xmath71 at @xmath55 to @xmath14 ) .",
    "we calculated upper and lower estimates in the same way , fitting to the maximum and minimum expected pulsars as defined by the errors quoted in @xcite .",
    "based on these calculations , we expect that about nine pulsars should have been detected in our sample , with upper and lower estimates of 16 and three pulsars , respectively .",
    "our results are not very sensitive to our choices of @xmath72 and @xmath73 since our limiting luminosities are above the @xmath73 cutoff . choosing a flatter slope for the luminosity distribution only increases the number of potentially observable pulsars . as a check on our method",
    ", we performed the same analysis using all the clusters searched by .",
    "m15 ( a dense , massive cluster with eight known pulsars ) was an outlier in these calculations , with far more pulsars predicted than are observed ; when it is excluded from the analysis , we predict @xmath74 observable pulsars in the sample .",
    "twenty have been discovered ( excluding the eight in m15 ) , which is consistent with this upper limit .",
    "@xcite also gave birth rates for pulsars in gcs for different formation mechanisms , the most relevant in our density regime being three - body exchanges .",
    "the birth rates are given per neutron star , so we once again use the results of @xcite for an estimate of the total neutron star content of our clusters .",
    "we also assume an msp lifetime of @xmath75 .",
    "based on these theoretical models , we should have been sensitive to @xmath76@xmath77 pulsars each in ngc2298 , terzan 9 , and ngc6981 , about ten in pal 6 , about two dozen in ngc5986 , @xmath78 in m92 , and @xmath79 in ngc7089 .",
    "we predict that @xmath80 pulsars should have been observable in our sample based on the results of @xcite .",
    "this prediction seems high given our single detection in ngc  5986 ( we note that this cluster was predicted to contain one observable pulsar based on the high estimates of @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , nearly all of the potentially observable msps come from m92 and ngc  7089 .",
    "this assertion is supported by the fact that these two clusters have the highest value of @xmath7 in our sample . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] , m92 in particular was searched fairly deeply , so this null result is particularly interesting .",
    "one parameter that was not taken into account in our simulations was metallicity .",
    "surveys of galactic and extra - galactic gcs have found @xmath81 times more bright lmxbs in metal - rich clusters ( defined by @xmath82 } < -1 $ ] ) @xcite and it is reasonable to believe that this effect may also manifest itself in the msp population .",
    "we note that eight of the clusters we studied have @xmath82 } < -1 $ ] , and that m92 in particular has the second lowest metallicity of any milky way gc  the most metal poor is m15 , which was greatly under - populated in msps based on the calculations discussed in  [ sec : low_dens ] .",
    "while a full treatment of metallicity effects is beyond the scope of this paper , our results may suggest that msps are less likely to be found in low metallicity clusters .",
    "we find that the results of @xcite drastically over - predict the number of msps that should be observable in our study .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that our assumed msp lifetime of @xmath83 is too long .",
    "an order of magnitude decrease in the lifetime would yield numbers that are closer to our observed results .",
    "however , based on observed spin down rates , msps should be very long lived .",
    "the other parameters in our calculations were the number of primordial neutron stars ( which we based off of @xcite ) and the rate of msp formation through exchange encounters calculated by @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems that one or both of these inputs is too large for clusters of low to moderate density . @xcite over predicts the number of observable msps in higher density clusters as well , so it seems that these rates may not be applicable when trying to predict the number of msps in a given cluster .",
    "we thus draw the following conclusions .",
    "gc pulsar searches are still sensitivity limited , and this necessarily makes any statements about the total population of cluster pulsars a matter of extrapolation .",
    "nevertheless , our results show no evidence for a population of pulsars in very low density systems ( @xmath4 ) , which is consistent with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "even given our sensitivity limits , though , it appears that clusters with densities @xmath84@xmath85 are not as efficient at forming msps as the results of imply .",
    "a full treatment of the effects of metallicity may shed more light on this discrepancy .",
    "we find evidence that low ( and high ) density gcs are either not as efficient at forming neutron stars or recycling them into msps through exchange interactions as earlier calculations by @xcite imply .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee whose helpful comments improved the quality of this manuscript .",
