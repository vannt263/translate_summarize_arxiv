    "an ensemble of macroscopic particles , which move ballistically between dissipative collisions , is usually termed as a _ granular gas _ , e.g. @xcite and the loss of energy at impacts is quantified by a restitution coefficient @xmath4 , @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are relative velocities of two particles before and after an impact and @xmath8 is the unit vector , connecting their centers at the collision instant . in what follows we assume that the particles are smooth spheres of diameter @xmath9 , that is , we do not consider the tangential motion of particles .",
    "then the restitution coefficient yields the after - collision velocities of particles in terms of the pre - collision ones , @xmath10 the simplest model for the restitution coefficient , @xmath11 , facilitates significantly the theoretical analysis and often leads to qualitatively valid results , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this assumption , however , contradicts the experimental observations , e.g. @xcite and basic mechanical laws , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a first - principle analysis of a dissipative collision may be performed , leading to a conclusion that @xmath4 must depend on the relative velocity of the colliding particles @xcite .",
    "if the impact velocity is not very high ( to avoid plastic deformation of particles material ) and not too small ( to avoid adhesive interactions at a collision @xcite ) , the viscoelastic contact model may be applied @xcite .",
    "this yields the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient @xcite : @xmath12 here @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the dimensionless temperature , expressed in terms of current granular temperature , [ temp ] @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the velocity distribution function of grains , @xmath18 is a gas number density , @xmath19 is the particle mass and @xmath20 is the thermal velocity ; @xmath21 is , correspondingly , the dimensionless impact velocity .",
    "the restitution coefficient @xmath4 ( [ eps ] ) depends on the small dissipation parameter @xmath22 @xmath23 proportional to the dissipative constant @xmath24 , @xmath25 which depends on the young modulus of the particle s material @xmath26 , its poisson ratio @xmath27 and the viscous constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 reads : @xmath31    due to inelastic nature of inter - particle collisions , the velocity distribution function of grains deviates from the maxwellian , so that the dimensionless distribution function @xcite @xmath32 may be represented in terms of the sonine polynomials expansion , e.g. @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dimensionless maxwellian distribution and the first few sonine polynomials read @xcite , @xmath35 provided that the expansion ( [ sonine ] ) converges , the sonine coefficients @xmath36 completely determine the form of @xmath37 . according to the definition of temperature @xmath38 @xcite , that is , the first non - trivial coefficient in the expansion ( [ sonine ] ) is @xmath39 . for the case of a constant @xmath4 the coefficient",

    "the expansion ( [ sonine ] ) quantifies the deviation of the distribution function from the maxwellian for the main part of the velocity distribution , that is , for @xmath40 ; the high - velocity tail of @xmath41 for @xmath42 is exponentially over - populated @xcite and requires a separate analysis .",
    "the impact - velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient , as it follows from the realistic visco - elastic collision model , has a drastic impact on the granular gas properties .",
    "namely , the form of the velocity distribution function and its time dependence significantly change @xcite , similarly changes the time dependence of the kinetic coefficients @xcite .",
    "moreover , the global behavior of the system qualitatively alters : instead of evolving to a highly non - uniform final state of a rarified gas and dense clusters , as predicted for @xmath43 @xcite , the clustering @xcite and the vortex formation @xcite occurs in a gas of viscoelastic particles only as a transient phenomena @xcite .",
    "based on the restitution coefficient given by eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) the theory of granular gases of viscoelastic particles has been developed , e.g. @xcite , where as in the case of a constant @xmath4 , only the first non - trivial sonine coefficient @xmath44 has been taken into account .",
    "although the evolution of the high - velocity tail of @xmath41 has been analyzed @xcite , neither the location of the tail , nor its amplitude was quantified .",
    "recently , however , it has been shown for the case of a constant restitution coefficient , that the next sonine coefficient @xmath0 is of the same order of magnitude as the main coefficient @xmath1 @xcite ; moreover , it was also shown that the amplitude of the high - velocity tail of @xmath45 and its contribution to the kinetic coefficients may be described quantitatively @xcite .",
    "finally , a new expression for the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient @xmath4 has been derived @xcite , which takes into account the effect of `` delayed recovery '' in a collision .",
    "the delayed recovery implies , that at the very end of an impact , when the colliding particles have already lost their contact , their material remains deformed @xcite .",
    "this affects the total dissipation at a collision , so that the revised @xmath4 reads @xcite : @xmath46 here @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the other numerical coefficients up to @xmath51 are given in @xcite .",

    "<S> kinetic properties of a granular gas of viscoelastic particles in a homogeneous cooling state are studied analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the most recent expression for the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient for colliding viscoelastic particles , which allows to describe systems with large inelasticity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous studies , the third coefficient @xmath0 of the sonine polynomials expansion of the velocity distribution function is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a complicated evolution of this coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that @xmath0 is always of the same order of magnitude as the leading second sonine coefficient @xmath1 ; this contradicts the existing hypothesis that the subsequent sonine coefficients @xmath1 , @xmath2 , are of an ascending order of a small parameter , characterizing particles inelasticity . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze evolution of the high - energy tail of the velocity distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the time dependence of the tail amplitude and of the threshold velocity , which demarcates the main part of the velocity distribution and the high - energy part . we also study evolution of the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath3 and explore the impact of the third sonine coefficient on the self - diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical predictions for the third sonine coefficient , threshold velocity and the self - diffusion coefficient are in a good agreement with the numerical finding .    </S>",
