    "as a result of the recent dispute as to whether the superconducting gap in the high - t@xmath13 materials is @xmath14 or @xmath9type all experiments which can contribute to resolve that question are of special importance@xcite .",
    "it was shown recently@xcite that the study of the polarization dependence of the electronic raman scattering can address these questions and can distinguish between the different orientations ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) of the gap as well .",
    "this evidence can be made more complete by including the phonons and the effect of the electron - phonon coupling , which is the subject of the present paper@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the lineshape of optical phonons in the high t@xmath3 superconductors has been the focus of a large body of investigation@xcite . of the many raman active modes in tetragonal superconductors , all the modes that have been observed in the cuprate materials using in - plane polarizations transform according the @xmath1 symmetry except one , which transforms according to @xmath0 symmetry@xcite .",
    "since this phonon obeys its own selection rules , the frequency of the mode can be unambiguously assigned , which is in contrast with the early confusion of the assignments of the separate @xmath1 modes .    in this paper the phonons involving the perpendicular vibrations of the in - plane",
    "oxygens are investigated .",
    "the displacements of the two oxygens o(2 ) and o(3 ) are in phase for @xmath1 symmetry and out of phase for @xmath0 as is shown on fig .",
    "( 1 ) for the case of yba@xmath2cu@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "the coupling of these phonons to the electrons in the plane has an interesting feature , namely a completely flat cuo@xmath2 plane taken out of the surrounding atomic environment has the mirror symmetry through the plane .",
    "thus the linear coupling between these phonons and the in - plane electrons is absent . in a crystal however , as it has first been pointed out by barii ' c _ et.al._@xcite , that symmetry can be broken since there is an electric field perpendicular to the plane due to the surrounding ions forming an asymmetric environment .",
    "this is in contrast to the la compound , where only the small tilting of the octahedra breaks the symmetry@xcite .",
    "the perpendicular electric field in the 1:2:3 material can be responsible for the buckling of the cuo@xmath2 plane , i.e. the slight separation of the planes formed by the cu and o ions .",
    "this small distortion however can not be responsible for the large electron - phonon coupling to be discussed here .",
    "since the long - range charge transfer fluctuations between unit cells are screened , only intracell charge transfers must be considered .",
    "let us denote the charge transfer fluctuations at o(2 ) and o(3 ) by @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see fig . 1 . ) respectively . a charge transfer fluctuation where",
    "@xmath21 is obviously coupled to the electric field and the crystal deforms in the form of the @xmath0 phonon , similarly @xmath22 is coupled to the @xmath1 phonon .",
    "the fluctuations of the in - plane charges are either due to the transfer ( i ) between the in - plane oxygens and other ions , or ( ii ) between the two in - plane oxygens",
    ". the fluctuations of the @xmath1 symmetry @xmath23 can be a consequence of the transfers between the in - plane copper and oxygens . for @xmath0 symmetry both ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "may be realized .",
    "considering the first possibility@xcite , the charge transfer in 1:2:3 between the bridging oxygen o(4 ) and the o(3 ) is a good candidate .",
    "as long as the non - bonding orbital of o(4 ) parallel to the cuo chain has a partial electronic density of states near the fermi surface , the transfer breaks the @xmath24 symmetry . that mechanism , which is sensitive to the position of the electronic partial density of states of the bridging oxygen relative to the fermi energy , has been worked out in detail@xcite , but the recently observed raman spectra are not consistent with the predicted @xmath16 superconducting gap@xcite .    the second possibility does not depend on such details of the electronic band structure , since only the conduction band plays a role .",
    "the charge transfer fluctuation @xmath25 between o(2 ) and o(3 ) involves especially those parts of the cylindrical fermi surface which are close to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 axis .",
    "thus the influence of the electron - phonon coupling on the electronic raman continuum depends strongly on whether a large superconducting gap opens at that part of the fermi surface .",
    "more precisely , the electronic contribution can be characterized by the azimuthal quantum number @xmath28 on the cylindrical fermi surface@xcite , and @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath0 symmetry , while out of the two ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) channels of @xmath1 symmetry only @xmath31 is relevant since the @xmath30 mode describes charge fluctuations between cells , which are screened by the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the different fermi surface areas probed by raman scattering in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 geometry are illustrated in fig .",
    "( @xmath1 and @xmath0 transforms like @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively ) . thus assuming a @xmath15 type superconducting gap the @xmath0 mode probes the areas with the largest gap , while the @xmath1 averages the areas of both the largest gap and the nodes .",
    "the most appropriate tool in the raman experiments to probe the electron - phonon coupling is to study the fano interference which is formed due to the simultaneous scattering of light on the phonons and the electronic continuum ( see eg",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the fit of the fano lineshape provides information not only on the coupling but also on the electronic continuum influenced by the opening of the superconducting gap .",
    "the appearance of a sharper gap in the @xmath0 symmetry than in the @xmath1 provides a unique identification of the gap of @xmath15 type@xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized however , that these experiments are not sensitive to the sign of the order parameter , therefore can not distinguish between @xmath34-wave superconductivity and a very highly anisotropic @xmath8 type .",
    "the present status of the relation between experiment and theory can be summarized as follows .",
    "the vibration of the @xmath0 mode which appears at roughly 340 wavenumbers in all cuprate materials , is connected with the antisymmetric out - of - plane vibrations of the o(2 ) and o(3 ) ions in the cu - o plane@xcite .",
    "the net charge transfer of this vibration in the unit cell is zero and thus the long range coulomb forces are incapable of screening the charge fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the mode has a large cross section for scattering incoming photons and thus appears in raman experiments as a large sharp signal centered at frequency shifts corresponding to the energy of the mode .",
    "due to the strength and unambiguous identification of the mode , the @xmath0 phonon has been lavished with attention@xcite . in particular",
    ", the spectral lineshape of the mode has been a subject of intense scrutiny both in the normal and superconducting state of the cuprates . in the normal state ,",
    "the asymmetry of the lineshape indicates strong mixing of the phonon with the electronic continuum and fits to a breit - wigner or fano lineshape have been made with great success@xcite .",
    "this has usually led to the assertion that the electron - phonon coupling at least for this mode is large .",
    "however no estimates of the coupling from a microscopic theory have been presented except for the theoretical suggestion by barii ' c and kupi ' c @xcite .",
    "further , the anomalous changes of the @xmath0 phonon as the material enters into the superconducting state have also been exhaustively documented@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the changes in the @xmath0 phonon s lineshape have been used to help determine the magnitude of the energy gap of the superconductor@xcite .",
    "recently , a theory of raman scattering in @xmath9wave superconductors has been presented@xcite and while the general features of the theory fit well with the experiment , no detailed fit of the lineshape could be made without further knowledge of the mechanism and strength of the electron - phonon coupling .    in the present paper",
    "we provide a detailed theory for the behavior of the @xmath0 phonon in both the normal and superconducting states of the cuprate materials using the mechanism suggested by barii ' c _ et.al._@xcite .",
    "in particular , we investigate the mechanism of electron - phonon coupling resulting from crystal field effects and describe the fano lineshape in the normal state .",
    "the theory is then generalized to the superconducting state and the lineshape is calculated in detail for a superconductor with @xmath4 pairing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we develope the mechanism which leads to first order electron - phonon coupling due to the presence of the crystal field .",
    "based on the 3-band model for the cuo@xmath2 plane the electron - phonon coupling constant is evaluated . in sec .",
    "we apply these results in order to fit the experimental data in the normal state .",
    "particular attention is paid to the fano resonance .",
    "section iv .",
    "is devoted to the behavior of the phonon lineshape in the superconducting state . here",
    "we show that the temperature dependence of the spectrum is due to the change in the electronic response , and the data are consistent with a @xmath15 gap .",
    "finally our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the first part of this section we define our model for the electrons in the cuo@xmath2 plane .",
    "this allows us to introduce notations used in the second part , where we develop a microscopic theory of the coupling of these electrons to the out - of - plane phonons due to the crystal field perpendicular to the plane .      using the notations of ref.@xcite we consider the 3-band model for the cuo@xmath2 plane described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath35 where @xmath36 creates an electron with spin @xmath37 at a copper lattice site @xmath38 , while @xmath39 annihilates an electron at one of the neighboring oxygen sites @xmath40 determined by the unit vector @xmath41 assuming the four values , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "an oxygen atom between the two copper atoms at sites @xmath38 and @xmath44 is labeled by either @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 is the difference of the cu and o site energies , @xmath48 is the cu - o hopping integral and @xmath49 depending on whether the orbitals ( with real wavefunctions ) have the same or opposite sign at the overlap region . assuming cu @xmath15 and o @xmath50 orbitals @xmath51 , and we can choose @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for simplicity ,",
    "we neglect direct o - o hopping .",
    "the momentum representation is defined by the following formulae : @xmath54 and @xmath55 a_{\\alpha,{\\bf k},\\sigma},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the lattice constant , @xmath57 is the number of cu sites and @xmath58 is @xmath59 or @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively . in this representation",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.(1 ) decouples for different momenta as @xmath63 where @xmath64+h.c.\\},\\ ] ] and @xmath65    @xmath66 is then easily diagonalized as @xmath67 where @xmath68 assumes the values @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for the antibonding , bonding , and nonbonding bands , respectively .",
    "the corresponding electronic energies are @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 the transformation between the original ( @xmath75 ) and the new ( @xmath34 ) electronic operators is described by @xmath76 where the column vectors of the transformation matrix are given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the last three equations we have dropped the @xmath79 indices for clarity .    in the physically relevant situation for the cuo@xmath2 plane",
    "the upper band is close to half filled . since the three bands do not overlap in the present model",
    ", we will consider only a reduced one - band hamiltonian describing the upper band and neglect the bonding and nonbonding bands .",
    "then the reduced hamiltonian is given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 furthermore , the expressions of the transformation from @xmath34 operators to @xmath56 and @xmath82 operators reduce to    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    where    @xmath86^{-1/2},\\ ] ]    @xmath87^{-1/2},\\ ] ]    @xmath88^{-1/2}.\\ ] ]    as we will see in the next subsection , this simple model contains the most important ingredients in order to describe the electron - phonon coupling .      as we have discussed already",
    ", the electrons in the cuo@xmath2 plane do not couple in first order to the phonon modes with displacement vectors perpendicular to the plane , because in that case the hopping integrals change only in second order in the displacements .",
    "however , if there is an electric field perpendicular to the plane , first order electron - phonon coupling is generated . in our case",
    "this field originates from the asymmetric environment around the cuo@xmath2 plane ( see fig.1 . ) , and is also responsible for the buckling of the plane with restoring force provided by the covalent bonds .",
    "let us consider the effect of a lattice periodic crystal field @xmath89 on the electrons in the plane . the electron density at each ( displaced ) site couples to the external field via the hamiltonian @xmath90\\nonumber \\\\ + & a^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf n},{\\bf x},\\sigma}a_{{\\bf n},{\\bf x},\\sigma } \\phi_{ext}[a{\\bf n}+a{\\bf x}/2+{\\bf u}_x(a{\\bf n})]\\nonumber \\\\ + & a^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf n},{\\bf y},\\sigma}a_{{\\bf n},{\\bf y},\\sigma } \\phi_{ext}[a{\\bf n}+a{\\bf y}/2+{\\bf u}_y(a{\\bf n})]\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are displacement vectors of the cu , o(2 ) , and o(3 ) in the unit cell at the lattice site @xmath38 , @xmath94 is the electron charge , and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are unit vectors in the corresponding directions .",
    "expansion in the displacements up to first order leads to @xmath97 where @xmath98 renormalizes the copper - oxygen site energy difference @xmath99 only , while the term linear in @xmath100 generates an electron - phonon interaction @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are the electric fields at the cu , o(2 ) , and o(3 ) sites respectively , which are parallel to the @xmath105-axis due to symmetry . in the absence of chains @xmath106 would hold .",
    "@xmath107 can be written in momentum representation with the help of eqs.(2 - 3 ) , and eq.(15 ) allows us to express the interaction of phonons and electrons of the reduced hamiltonian eq.(13 ) in the usual form @xmath108.\\ ] ] here @xmath109 annihilates a phonon mode @xmath110 with wavevector @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the coupling constant of that mode to an electron of wavevector @xmath113 . based on our microscopic model the coupling constant",
    "can easily be evaluated using standard procedures of the quantum theory of phonons@xcite .    in the context of raman scattering",
    "we are interested in @xmath114 optical phonons . in case of the @xmath0 phonon",
    "the cu displacement is zero , while the o(2 ) and o(3 ) atoms have equal and opposite displacements ( fig.1.b . ) .",
    "the corresponding coupling constant is evaluated as @xmath115 is the phonon frequency . in the following",
    "we make the approximation @xmath116 . due to the opposite displacements of the oxygens ,",
    "the _ difference _ of the @xmath117 functions ( given by eq.(16 ) ) determines the @xmath113 dependence of the @xmath0 coupling . since @xmath118 on the fermi surface ( see eq.(14 ) ) , this coupling constant is proportional to @xmath119 , which is clearly of @xmath0 character .",
    "in fact , this is exactly the second order fermi surface harmonic@xcite of our model band structure ( eq.(14 ) ) transforming according to the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "therefore we can write the coupling in the form @xmath120 where @xmath121\\ ] ] is the normalized second order fermi surface harmonic of @xmath0 symmetry with the normalization constant at the fermi energy @xmath122 given by@xcite @xmath123[\\cos(ak_x)- \\cos(ak_y)]^2\\over\\int d^2 k \\delta [ e_f - e({\\bf k})]}.\\ ] ] all information about the strength of the coupling is now compressed in the expansion coefficient @xmath124    in case of the @xmath1 phonon the oxygen displacements are the same both in magnitude and in direction ( fig.1.a ) and the displacement of the copper is negligible due to the relative rigidity of its vertical bonds .",
    "the same procedure employed for the @xmath0 phonon yields the following coupling constant for the @xmath1 phonon @xmath125.\\ ] ] in this case however , the coupling depends on @xmath113 only through the energy @xmath126 , i.e. it is constant on the fermi surface for any band filling . therefore within the present model the @xmath1 phonon couples to homogeneous density fluctuations only , and since these fluctuations are suppressed by the long range coulomb interaction , the resulting coupling is vanishingly small .",
    "this conclusion remains valid if we allow for a finite cu displacement as well@xcite , but does not necessarily hold if e.g. o - o hopping is included .    at the end of this section",
    "we wish to evaluate the coupling in eq.(25 ) . for a half filled band the fermi energy @xmath127 , and the normalization constant @xmath128 .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that @xmath129 , and in this limit we only need the electric field @xmath130 at the oxygen site for a numerical value of @xmath131 . in order to estimate this field",
    "we suppose that the charges on the planes of the unit cell of yba@xmath2cu@xmath17o@xmath132 are evenly distributed , and the charges ( per unit cell , in units of @xmath94 ) for the planes y , ba , and cuo@xmath2 are + 3 , + 2 , and -2 respectively , while the remaining ( chain ) region has -3 electron charge to insure neutrality of the unit cell .",
    "each plane produces an electric field at the oxygen site we are concerned with independent of its distance . since all planes in the sample contribute , we consider ever larger environments of the cuo@xmath2 plane in question .",
    "we calculate the field produced by the two neighboring ( y and ba ) planes first , then include the next nearest neighbors etc .",
    "the series of values for @xmath130 is of course not convergent , but has a period of the unit cell .",
    "although a more accurate calculation applying the ewald summation is desirable@xcite , for an estimate we use the average value in this series , which yields @xmath133ev /  . according to eq.(25 )",
    "this crystal field generates a coupling @xmath134ev .",
    "the relevant dimensionless coupling @xmath135 if we use a total density of states at the fermi level @xmath136/ev corresponding to a bandwidth of 9ev .",
    "we note here that due to the presence of chains the tetragonal symmetry of the cuo@xmath2 plane is weakly broken , and @xmath137 .",
    "this leads to the slight mixing of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes .",
    "in this section we utilize our calculations for the coupling constant to discuss the resulting spectra of the cuprates in the normal state , while in the next section we discuss the changes in the spectra due to superconductivity .",
    "the inelastic scattering of photons from a metal can either be caused by collisions with phonons or via the creation of electron - hole pairs .",
    "as well , the phonons interact with the electronic continuum and have a dynamical effect on the way photons are scattered .",
    "the total light scattering cross section resulting from these contributions is depicted by the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "3 . the coupling constant @xmath138 describes the electron - photon coupling , ( i.e. , the raman vertex for particle - hole creation due to the vector potential of the incoming light ) . in the limit of small momentum transfer and frequency transfers smaller than the optical band gap ,",
    "the raman vertex is simply related to the curvature of the band dispersion @xmath139 and the incident @xmath140 and scattered @xmath141 polarization light vectors via @xmath142 which can be expanded in terms of fermi surface harmonics @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "the remaining vertices we denote by @xmath145 for the photon - phonon vertex , and @xmath146 for the electron - phonon vertex as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the bare phonon propagator is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the intrinsic phonon linewidth resulting from e.g. the decay of the phonon caused by the presence of an anharmonic lattice potential .",
    "in the metallic state , the electron - phonon coupling renormalizes the phonon propagator such that @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the complex electronic susceptibility evaluated in channel @xmath110@xcite . defining the renormalized phonon frequency through @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 denotes the real part of the susceptibility",
    ", we arrive at the following expression for the renormalized phonon propagator @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the total frequency dependent linewidth of the phonon , @xmath156 .",
    "we now sum up the diagrams in fig .",
    "( 3 ) for the raman response in terms of the susceptibility @xmath150 .",

    "thus @xmath160 represents the symmetry elements of the raman vertex projected out by the incoming and outgoing photon polarization vectors .",
    "( 32 ) is a generalized form of the breit - wigner or fano lineshape describing the interaction of a discrete excitation ( phonon ) with an electronic continuum . here",
    "the frequency @xmath161 sets the position of the antiresonance of the lineshape . if the intrinsic phonon width @xmath162 then at the antiresonance @xmath163 .",
    "since @xmath150 describes the electronic contribution to raman scattering , which is generally featureless and a smooth function of frequency , we can replace everywhere @xmath150 by the value it takes on near the phonon frequency to fit the raman spectra in the vicinity of the phonon . however to fit the entire spectrum in the normal state , the full @xmath164 dependence is required .",
    "the description of the continuum in high t@xmath3 superconductors has been the focus of a large body of both theoretical and experimental work . while at present no theory can completely describe the full symmetry - dependent continuum for a large range of frequency shifts , we now give expressions for the continuum in two separate cases . in the presence of impurity scattering ,",
    "the continuum lineshape has a simple lorenztian form @xcite @xmath165 here @xmath166 is the channel - dependent impurity scattering rate reduced by vertex corrections . while this form can fit the data on the cuprate materials at least in the @xmath0 channel ( i.e. , crossed polarization orientations aligned 45 degrees with respect to the @xmath167 axis in the cu - o planes ) at low frequencies , the high frequency tail which remains relatively constant and the frequency behavior at low frequencies in other channels can not be accounted for .",
    "another form for the continuum can be arrived at by taking nesting of the fermi surface into account as has been done by one of the present authors@xcite .",
    "the raman susceptibility has a similar form as eq .",
    "( 34 ) with the impurity scattering rate replaced by the addition of the electron - electron and impurity scattering rates on a nested fermi surface and the effect of mass renormalization taken into account , @xmath168,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are constants determined by a fit to the electronic continuum in the normal state .",
    "this form for the raman susceptibility provides an adequate description to the continuum in the normal state of both ybco and bscco ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and thus we will use this form rather than eq .",
    "( 34 ) .    in order to fit the raman spectra in the normal state",
    ", one sees from eqs .",
    "( 32 ) and ( 35 ) that a great deal of parameters are required .",
    "a fitting procedure is now discussed that greatly reduces the number of free parameters .",
    "the first step in the procedure is to determine the bare phonon parameters @xmath171 and @xmath148 , which in principle can simply be read off from a fit to the lineshape of the phonon in the insulating state where @xmath172 .",
    "while the intrinsic width of the phonon can be read off as @xmath173@xmath174 , a problem arises with the position of the @xmath0 phonon , since it shows only a small renormalization with doping from the insulator to the metallic state @xcite , the origin of which is unknown .",
    "this could be due in part to changes of the lattice parameters with doping and/or the tetragonal to orthorhombic transition@xcite .",
    "therefore , we thus must keep this parameter free and use the bare frequency we obtain from fitting the normal state . while in principle @xmath145",
    "can be determined as well at this stage , since the intensity of the spectra is given in arbitrary units , this parameter ( which sets the overall intensity ) must also remain free .",
    "turning next to the metallic state , the continuum parameters @xmath175 and @xmath160 are tuned to fit the full frequency range of the continuum minus the contribution of the phonons .",
    "we then tune the renormalized phonon position , @xmath176 , which we later can compare with the result predicted from the value of @xmath131 obtained in section ii .",
    "thus the only unknown parameters are @xmath145 ( and thus @xmath68 ) , which also sets the antiresonance position @xmath177 , and the bare phonon frequency .    with these constrainsts ,",
    "such a procedure produces the theory lines shown in fig .",
    "( 4a ) compared to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite on ybco .",
    "the parameters used to obtain the fit are as follows : @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 @xmath182@xmath183and@xmath184 , which sets @xmath185 @xmath174 .",
    "similar fits have been obtained before via the usual fano expression@xcite albeit with unconstrained parameters determined solely via a fitting routine .",
    "the value of the coupling constant used is roughly 20 percent smaller than the one given by the crude approximation in section ii . given the uncertainty involved in the band parameters and the neglect of screening ( which will reduce the crystal field and thus lower the coupling constant ) , we remark that the coupling constant derived from a microscopic picture of charge transfer within the unit cell provides an accurate description of the strength of the asymmetric fano lineshape of the @xmath0 phonon in ybco .",
    "turning now to the superconducting state , we note that eq . ( 32 ) is still a valid description of the raman lineshape provided that we use the raman susceptibility calculated for the superconducting case .",
    "in fact , it is possible to obtain important information about the symmetry of the electron pairing in a superconductor through an investigation of the changes in the phonon lineshape below t@xmath3 . in particular",
    ", the electron - phonon coupling depends crucially on the symmetries of both the phonon and the order parameter .",
    "the role of the coupling between a phonon of given symmetry and an order parameter of a different symmetry was recently discussed by one of the authors @xcite , where it was shown that changes in the phonon lineshape are the greatest for a phonon which possesses the same symmetry as the order parameter while smaller changes are predicted for phonons of a symmetry orthogonal to that of the energy gap .",
    "this is pictorially shown in fig .",
    "2 , which shows the energy gap @xmath186 squared and the electron - phonon vertex @xmath187 squared , which enters into the raman response function @xmath188 as a weighted average around the fermi surface .",
    "thus the phonon vertex and the energy gap will contructively ( destructively ) interfere with each other if they have the same ( orthogonal ) symmetry .",
    "this fact can be used to determine the predominant energy gap symmetry .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the electronic contribution to raman scattering @xmath150 was calculated in detail for a superconductor with @xmath4 pairing symmetry and good fits were obtained to the raman spectra of bscco . for details of the theory , we direct the reader to that reference and simply write down the raman response function obtained for the @xmath0 channel using a @xmath4 gap , @xmath189 for a cylindrical fermi surface ( here @xmath190 ) : @xmath191 , & $ x\\le 1 $ , \\cr x [ ( 1 + 2x^{2})k(1/x)-2(1+x^{2})e(1/x ) ] , & $ x > 1$.}\\ ] ] the real parts are obtainable through kramers - kronig analysis ( see ref .",

    "( 36 ) and its real part rather than eqs .",
    "( 34 - 35 ) .",
    "using the coupling constant @xmath196 as obtained in fitting the normal state leads to @xmath197 @xmath174 and @xmath198 @xmath174 , i.e. , the phonon broadens and softens at low temperatures compared to its normal state lineshape .    the fit points towards the predominance of an energy gap of @xmath0 symmetry for the following reasons .",
    "first we remark that the theory predicts the correct magnitude and sign of the phonon renormalization due to superconductivity",
    ". this would be in marked contrast if the gap was @xmath14wave or of @xmath9wave nature but of other symmetry ( @xmath199,etc ) . in the first case an isotropic gap would lead to trivial coupling of the energy gap to the symmetry of the phonon and all phonons",
    "would show the same qualitative behavior , which is not the case for the cuprates @xcite .",
    "in the second case , previous work has demonstrated that the channel probed via raman scattering which shows a peak at the highest frequency in the continuum in the superconducting state of all the channels gives the predominant symmetry of the energy gap .",
    "this again points to @xmath4 pairing .",
    "further , if the gap was of another symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath200 or @xmath1 ) then the position of the phonon , @xmath201 , would predict small phonon softening since @xmath202 the real part of the phonon self energy changes from negative to positive values at roughly @xmath203 , and ( ii ) the weight @xmath204 over the fermi surface which determines the coupling would be smaller for a gap of different symmetry than the vertex . therefore , while although raman can not distinguish between and energy gap which changes sign or not around the fermi surface , the evidence from the data indicate that the electronic pairing is predominantly of @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "in order to improve the study of the superconducting gap anisotropy in high temperature superconductors@xcite the interactions of the electronic continuum and the characteristic phonons shown in fig . 1 have been included in the theory . these interactions and",
    "the intrinsic width of the phonons had complicated a previous comparison of the theory for the continuum for certain gap anisotropy to the experimental data since the contribution of the phonons had to be subtracted in an intuitive way ( see ref .",
    "2 ) . in addition",
    ", the phonon lineshape is of course distorted by the fano interference .",
    "the starting point of our calculation was the model calculation of the electron - phonon interaction based on ref .",
    "6 and a simple tight binding calculation for the electrons is used .",
    "the latter is certainly not very adequate but demonstrates the correct characteristic symmetry properties of the electronic wave functions .",
    "\\(i ) _ phonon lineshape _ - the asymmetric fano lineshape of the @xmath0 phonon is reproduced while the interaction of the continuum with the @xmath1 phonon is much weaker according to the experiments @xcite and disappears in our model calculation ( see sec . ii b ) . using more adequate electronic wave functions , this coupling may reappear but still must be weaker than in the case of the @xmath0 phonon ;    \\(ii ) _ electric field _ - the perpendicular electric field acting on the oxygen atoms in the cuo@xmath5 plane has been determined by a comparison with the experiments in the normal phase , assuming tetragonal symmetry , i.e. , @xmath205 .",
    "this symmetry is certainly destroyed by the presence of the chains as shown in fig . 1 , and results in a mixing of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 symmetry channels .",
    "it is obvious from the coupling presented in sec .",
    "ii b and from the calculation of the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "3 , that starting with , e.g. , light polarizations assigned to @xmath0 symmetry , the coupling with @xmath206 leads to a contribution to the electronic continumm of @xmath1 symmetry which is further coupled to the @xmath1 phonons .",
    "the @xmath1 phonons do appear in the @xmath0 spectrum observed by experiments ( see fig .",
    "4a ) , but it is not clear whether this is dominantly due to misalignments of the samples or to the channel mixing . a more elaborate calculation of the electric fields @xmath207 and @xmath208 arising from different ions would certainly help to resolve this question ;    \\(iii ) _ gap anisotropy _ - the excellent fit of the combined electronic continuum + phonon spectrum in fig .",
    "4b is obtained by assuming the simplest form of the superconducting gap of @xmath4 type for @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the parameters are borrowed from the fitting of the normal state .",
    "the only additional parameters introduced are the gap amplitude defined above eq .",
    "( 36 ) and an additional smearing @xmath209 with a non - unique origin ( see sec .",
    "this fit certainly supports the previous fit in ref .",
    "@xcite where the phonons had been subtracted .    concerning the anisotropy of the gap it has already been pointed out that raman scattering provides information only concerning the absolute value of the gap .",
    "the fit of the low energy spectra in the present paper clearly demonstrates that assuming @xmath9wave pairing in the superconductor , the gap with @xmath4 symmetry gives an excellent fit but @xmath210 and @xmath211 are not applicable ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a very highly anisotropic extended @xmath14wave state which has predominantly @xmath0 symmetry can not be ruled out .",
    "for instance recently the photoemission experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests a gap which can be represented by the form @xmath212/(1+a)$ ] , with the parameter @xmath56 just exceeding one .",
    "our fits clearly show that a fit with @xmath213 are not satisfactory .",
    "the reason is that the different contributions of the different gap features to the low energy ( @xmath214 ) part of the spectra with e.g. @xmath0 symmetry : ( i)the large gap around @xmath215 does not contribute ( see fig .",
    "2 ) ; ( ii ) the gap changing sign at @xmath216 contributes as @xmath217 at low frequencies ; ( iii ) the gap touching zero with zero slope ( parameter @xmath213 ) at @xmath216 contributes as @xmath164 at low frequencies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( iv ) the gap with zero slope but not at zero energy ( parameter @xmath218 ) gives a sharp discontinuity and approximately linear term ( modulo logs ) above or below it ( @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively ) .    on the basis of the above feautures , the zero slope at energy larger than @xmath221@xmath174 and at @xmath222",
    "can be ruled out . any feature with a gap minimum on a smaller energy scale can however still be possible , but the region of the fermi surface where the minima occur must be very narrow compared with those given by the expression mentioned above . as the minima should occur in an anomalously narrow region , the slopes coming or leaving",
    "the minima must be very large .",
    "such a behavior appear to us as very unlikely .    in summary ,",
    "the main result of the present paper is the confirmation of the conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite , namely , that the raman spectra are in excellent agreement with a superconducting gap of @xmath4 symmetry , but gaps with very sharp features on a small part of the fermi surface can not be ruled out .",
