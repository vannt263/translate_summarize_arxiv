    "inspired by the puzzling normal - state properties of the copper - oxide superconductors , the search for possible non - fermi liquid states of metals continues to be a central topic in the theory of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "an interesting new clue toward an understanding of the cuprates and other materials comes from experiments on a variety of materials , indicating a nematic phase transition.@xcite this is a quantum phase transition which , while preserving translational symmetry , breaks the lattice rotational symmetry from square to rectangular , i.e. , the invariance under rotations of the system in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane by @xmath4 is lost . at the quantum critical point ,",
    "electrons couple strongly to order parameter fluctuations , leading to a destruction of the fermi liquid state .",
    "the resulting distortion of the fermi surface is also referred to as a pomeranchuk transition.@xcite    the conventional theoretical approach to quantum critical phenomena is the so - called hertz - millis approach , where the interaction between electrons is decoupled via a ( bosonic ) hubbard - stratonovich transformation and the fermionic degrees of freedom are integrated out.@xcite however , as in the metallic state the electrons are gapless , this approach usually leads to singular vertices , which especially in low dimensions need to be treated with care .",
    "it can therefore be advantageous not to integrate out the fermions at all .    as concerns the nematic phase transition , the most effective scattering processes of electrons take place when the momentum of the bosons is locally almost tangential to the fermi surface .",
    "the phase transition can therefore be modeled by coupling electrons in the vicinity of two patches of a fermi surface to a gapless scalar ising order parameter field .",
    "indeed , the coupling of gapless fermions to gapless bosonic fluctuations is known to give rise to non - fermi liquid behavior.@xcite the corresponding field theory is very similar to a nonrelativistic gauge theory , which has been studied intensively,@xcite starting with the important work by holstein , norton , and pincus.@xcite such gauge theories have applications in a number of different problems , such as the description of the half - filled landau level,@xcite the description of spin liquids in terms of spinons which can form a critical spinon fermi surface,@xcite or the description of the instability of a ferromagnetic quantum critical point.@xcite similar gauge theories have also been used to describe fermions on a honeycomb lattice interacting through an electromagnetic gauge field.@xcite in all cases , the low - energy behavior is expected to be described by a scale - invariant scaling theory .",
    "the single - particle green function @xmath5 was calculated@xcite for a spherical fermi surface within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , resulting in @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the frequency and momentum of the electron , @xmath9 is a complex constant depending on the sign of @xmath7 , and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fermi velocity and @xmath12 is the fermi momentum , denotes the single - particle excitation energy .",
    "while the static part of the self - energy remains unrenormalized , its dynamic part implies that both the renormalized energy and damping rate of the electron scale in exactly the same way .",
    "consequently , there are no well - defined sharp quasiparticles and landau s fermi liquid theory breaks down .    for a long time",
    ", it was thought that the above scenario holds true when going beyond the rpa .",
    "@xcite it was believed that this can be justified by considering the limit of large @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is the number of fermion flavors .",
    "however , it was recently shown by lee@xcite that , even if one considers only scattering processes in the vicinity of a single patch of the fermi surface , the coupling to a gapless gauge field results in very strong correlations such that , even in the large-@xmath13 limit , the theory remains strongly coupled . subsequently , and sachdev@xcite considered a more realistic two - patch model where the two patches of the fermi surface to which a given bosonic momentum is tangent are retained ; they derived a scaling theory and explicitly calculated corrections to the bosonic and fermionic self - energies up to three loops , using the one - loop propagator in internal loop integrations .",
    "metlitski and sachdev identified certain three - loop contributions to the bosonic and fermionic self - energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : msdiagrams ] ) , which give rise to logarithmically divergent corrections to the one - loop rpa results .",
    "exponentiating these logarithmic terms , they obtained the following expression for the retarded propagator of the fermions , @xmath14^{1-\\eta_\\psi/2 } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the anomalous dimension of the fermion field and @xmath16 is the fermionic dynamic critical exponent . using scaling relations for the fermionic and bosonic green functions , metlitski and",
    "sachdev argued that the fermionic dynamic exponent is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the corresponding bosonic dynamic exponent .",
    "their explicit calculations@xcite show that @xmath19 is not renormalized by fluctuations up to three loops , implying that @xmath20 is correctly given by the one - loop approximation .",
    "on the other hand , for the fermionic anomalous dimension , metlitski and sachdev obtain the finite result @xmath21 at the ising - nematic transition , whereas @xmath22 within the one - loop approximation .    on a technical level",
    ", the reason for the breakdown of the large-@xmath13 expansion can be traced back to the fact that the curvature of the fermion propagator comes with a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "this in combination with a cancellation of the curvature in a set of planar diagrams eventually leads to the breakdown of the large-@xmath13 expansion . in the words of chubukov,@xcite",
    "there is _ hidden one - dimensionality _ in two - dimensional systems .",
    "+ albeit @xmath0 can not be used as a control parameter , it was suggested by mross _ et al._,@xcite following earlier work at finite @xmath13 by nayak and wilczek,@xcite to use @xmath18 as a tunable parameter . in this case",
    "it is possible to consider the limits @xmath23 and @xmath24 while keeping the product @xmath25 finite to bring the calculation under control .",
    "using a tunable @xmath18 is a sensible strategy because a non - local interaction is not expected to be renormalized . extrapolating the results obtained by mross _",

    "obviously , this value is much larger than the estimate @xmath28 by metlitski and sachdev .",
    "@xcite    even though the calculations in refs .   and",
    "are based on the field - theoretical renormalization group , the fact that two independent calculations involving different types of approximations produce different values for @xmath1 shows that on a quantitative level there are still open questions . due to the sign problem in quantum monte carlo calculations and the fact that dynamical mean field theory can essentially only predict mean field exponents , the number of alternative methods to verify the correctness of the anomalous scaling properties of the ising - nematic transition is limited . in this work ,",
    "we study this problem by means of the one - particle irreducible implementation of the functional renormalization group ( frg ) method,@xcite which is a modern implementation of the wilsonian renormalization group idea .",
    "the flexibility of frg methods to deal with systems involving both fermionic and bosonic fields has already been used by several authors.@xcite in particular , in refs .",
    "it has been shown that it can be advantageous to introduce a cutoff parameter @xmath29 which regularizes the infrared divergences only in the momentum carried by the bosonic field ( the momentum - transfer cutoff scheme ) .",
    "we show in this work that this cutoff scheme is also convenient to study the nematic quantum critical point .",

    "we explicitly calculate the effect of vertex corrections on the value of the fermionic anomalous dimension , @xmath1 , to leading order in the small parameter @xmath30 . in the concluding section  [ sec : conclusions ] ,",
    "we summarize our results and discuss some open problems .",
    "we have added two appendices with more technical details . in appendix",
    "a we derive skeleton equations relating the purely bosonic two - point and three - point functions to the fermionic propagators and irreducible vertices .",
    "these skeleton equations are useful to close the infinite hierarchy of frg flow equations .",
    "finally , in appendix b , we explicitly evaluate the symmetrized fermionic loop with three external bosonic legs ( the symmetrized three - loop vertex ) for our model system .",
    "we are interested in a minimal model describing the coupling of electrons in the proximity of a two - dimensional fermi surface to a gapless scalar bose field . in particular",
    ", the bosonic field can describe the fluctuations of a scalar order parameter near the onset of a metallic ising - nematic phase , such as a @xmath31-wave nematic state in a two - dimensional square lattice , where the point - group symmetry of the lattice is reduced from square to rectangular .",
    "however , the gapless scalar bose field can also describe the fluctuations of an emergent gauge field minimally coupled to a two - dimensional fermi surface .",
    "for example , this can be physically realized in a system where a spin - liquid phase is described in terms of fermionic degrees of freedom ( spinons ) , thereby causing the emergence of a @xmath32 gauge symmetry in the system : the critical fluctuations near the onset of the spin - liquid phase are then described by the coupling of the spinon fermi surface to the corresponding @xmath32 gauge field .",

    "the integration symbols are defined by @xmath40 , and similarly for the bosonic quantities , where @xmath41 is the inverse temperature and @xmath42 is the volume . throughout this work",
    "it is understood that we eventually take the zero temperature limit ( @xmath43 ) and the infinite volume limit ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the index @xmath45 labels @xmath13 different flavors of the fermion field .    the fermionic energy dispersion @xmath46 is defined relative to the fermi energy @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 , while , in the bosonic dispersion , @xmath49 plays the role of a mass ( or gap ) term which measures the distance to the quantum critical point : at the quantum critical point , @xmath50 , such that order parameter fluctuations become gapless .",
    "the absence of higher - order terms in @xmath36 and gradients of @xmath36 in the action defining our model can be justified by a dimensional analysis , which shows that such higher - order terms become irrelevant at the critical point .    in the general form given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spsi])([eq : sint ] ) , the action of our model is still too complicated to be treated analytically with renormalization group or field - theoretical methods . however , as pointed out by metlitski and sachdev@xcite ( see also ref .  ) , the relevant critical fluctuations can be described by a simplified minimal action involving only fermion fields with momenta close to two opposite patches on the fermi surface .",
    "the reason is that the most singular scattering processes mediated by a given bosonic mode with momentum @xmath51 involve only fermions lying on patches of the fermi surface which are almost tangential to the bosonic momentum @xmath51 .",
