    "what is quantum gravity ?",
    "this question would be one of the most difficult questions we have ever faced .",
    "quantum gravity naively means to  quantize \" a riemannian manifold since , according to the general relativity , gravity is the dynamics of spacetime geometry where spacetime is a riemannian manifold and the gravitational field is represented by a riemannian metric .",
    "but we are still vague how to  quantize \" the riemannian manifold .    mathematically ,",
    "in order to define the quantization of a dynamical system , it is necessary to first specify an underlying poisson structure of the dynamical system.@xcite the dynamical system will be described by a poisson manifold @xmath9 where @xmath3 is a differentiable manifold whose local coordinates are denoted by @xmath10 and the poisson structure @xmath11 is a ( not necessarily nondegenerate ) bivector field .",
    "the poisson structure ( [ poisson - st ] ) defines an @xmath12-bilinear antisymmetric operation @xmath13 by @xmath14 such that the bracket , called the poisson bracket , satisfies @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "a poisson manifold appears as a natural generalization of symplectic manifolds where the poisson structure @xmath17 reduces to a symplectic structure if @xmath17 is nongenerate.@xcite    formally , the quantization , especially the canonical quantization where @xmath18 in eq.([poisson - st ] ) is a nondegenerate constant matrix , can be done by associating to a commutative algebra @xmath19 of smooth functions , a noncommutative algebra @xmath20 of linear operators acting on a suitable hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "that is , the dynamical variables @xmath22 in a classical system are replaced by self - adjoint operators @xmath23 acting on @xmath21 and the poisson bracket ( [ poisson - bracket ] ) is replaced by a quantum bracket @xmath24.\\ ] ] this completes the quantization of the dynamical system whose phase space @xmath3 now becomes noncommutative , i.e. @xmath25 = i \\theta^{ab}.\\ ] ]    note that the detailed structure of poisson manifold @xmath9 depends on what kind of dynamical system we consider .",
    "a prominent example is the mechanical system of classical particles where @xmath3 is the particle phase space with coordinates @xmath26 and the poisson structure @xmath27 . here , we intentionally inserted the planck constant @xmath28 into @xmath17 to emphasize that the deformation ( quantization ) parameter @xmath28 carries the physical dimension of length times momentum , i.e. , @xmath29 so that @xmath17 is dimensionless . in this case , the quantization ( [ qm - bracket ] ) defines quantum mechanics as we know very well and the particle phase space @xmath3 is now noncommutative , i.e. @xmath30 = i\\hbar \\delta^i_j.\\ ] ]    a classical field theory is a generalization of finite - dimensional particle system to an infinite - dimensional system where particles are described by several continuous functions @xmath31 defined on spacetime @xmath32 and their conjugate variables @xmath33 where the index @xmath34 denotes internal degrees of freedom . in this case , the corresponding poisson structure is defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a spacelike hypersurface in spacetime .",
    "the poisson structure ( [ field - poisson ] ) generalizes the poisson bracket ( [ poisson - bracket ] ) to an infinite - dimensional poisson manifold @xmath37 as follows @xmath38 for any functionals @xmath39 depending on the functions @xmath40 on @xmath41 .",
    "the canonical quantization ( [ qm - bracket ] ) for the poisson bracket ( [ field - bracket ] ) leads to quantized fields , e.g. , @xmath42 = i \\hbar \\delta^{ab } \\delta^3 ( \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}).\\ ] ] quantum field theory is therefore defined by quantizing an infinite - dimensional poisson manifold @xmath37 in terms of @xmath28 again , as we clearly know .",
    "now consider to  quantize \" gravity .",
    "first we have to carefully contemplate about what is the dynamical system for gravity we want to quantize .",
    "to lift the veil , it is necessary to clearly pin down what is the underlying poisson manifold @xmath9 for quantum gravity .",
    "note that gravity describes the dynamics of spacetime geometry and it is characterized by its own intrinsic scale given by the newton constant @xmath0 where classical gravity corresponds to @xmath43 limit . for an astronomical body with mass @xmath3 is not small .",
    "for example , @xmath44 for the earth where @xmath45 kg , which corresponds to 1 cm compared to the planck length @xmath46 cm .",
    "] furthermore , since the gravitational constant @xmath0 carries the physical dimension of @xmath1 in natural unit , the newton constant @xmath47 , as will be seen soon , actually signifies an intrinsic poisson structure of spacetime @xmath48 therefore , it should be reasonable to ponder on the possibility that the quantum gravity is defined by quantizing spacetime itself in terms of @xmath47 instead of @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "quantum gravity may be defined by the poisson manifold @xmath9 , where @xmath3 is a spacetime manifold with the poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson]).@xcite    customarily , we have taken the same route to the quantization of gravity as the conventional quantum field theory . to be precise ,",
    "basic phase space variables for canonical quantum gravity are defined by a spatial metric @xmath49 defined on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath50 and the canonically conjugate variable @xmath51 together with hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "that is , the basic poisson manifold @xmath37 is defined by @xmath52 with the poisson structure ( [ field - poisson ] ) where @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the conventional quantum gravity also intends to quantize an infinite - dimensional _ particle _ ( graviton ) phase space associated with the metric field @xmath54 ( or its variants such as the ashtekar variables or spin networks ) of riemannian geometry .",
    "this quantization scheme is very different from the quantum gravity defined with the poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) because the quantization of poisson manifold @xmath37 is to quantize a _ particle _ ( graviton ) phase space @xmath55 in terms of @xmath28 while the quantization of poisson manifold @xmath9 is to quantize spacetime @xmath3 itself in terms of the newton constant @xmath47.@xcite    now we have to understand what is the origin of the spacetime poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) and what is the relation between poisson geometry @xmath9 and einstein gravity or riemannian geometry @xmath5 .",
    "it is well - known that the union of three  fundamental \" constants in nature , the planck constant @xmath28 in quantum mechanics , the universal velocity @xmath56 in relativity , and the newton constant @xmath47 in gravity , uniquely fixes characteristic scales for quantum gravity : @xmath57 and it is believed that in the planck scale @xmath2 spacetime is no longer commuting but becomes noncommutative , i.e. @xmath58 = i \\theta^{\\mu\\nu}.\\ ] ] note that the noncommutative spacetime ( [ nc - spacetime ] ) arises from the quantization ( [ qm - bracket ] ) with the poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) like as in eq.([nc - space ] ) . in general , if spacetime @xmath3 supports a poisson structure such as ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) , the algebra @xmath19 of smooth functions defined on the spacetime @xmath3 becomes a lie algebra under the poisson bracket@xcite @xmath59 in the case where @xmath60 is a constant matrix of rank @xmath61 , we can apply the same canonical quantization to the poisson manifold @xmath9 .",
    "we can associate to a commutative algebra @xmath62 of smooth functions defined on the spacetime @xmath3 , a noncommutative algebra @xmath20 of linear operators on a suitable hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "that is , the smooth functions @xmath22 become noncommutative operators ( fields ) @xmath23 acting on @xmath21 and the poisson bracket ( [ st - bracket ] ) is replaced by a noncommutative bracket @xmath63 \\in { \\cal a}_\\theta$].@xcite as a result , spacetime becomes noncommutative after the quantization and satisfies the heisenberg algebra ( [ nc - spacetime ] ) .",
    "therefore , we understand that spacetime admits the intrinsic poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) as long as spacetime at a microscopic world is noncommutative . now",
    "the pith and marrow of quantum gravity is to understand how to derive a riemannian geometry @xmath64 from a poisson geometry @xmath9 of spacetime . because quantization in general introduces a new kind of duality between physical or mathematical entities , the question is what kind of duality arises from the quantization ( [ nc - spacetime ] ) of spacetime itself .",
    "recall that the quantization ( [ nc - particle ] ) of particle phase space introduces the wave - particle duality in quantum mechanics .",
    "the wave - particle duality results from the fact that translations in the noncommutative phase space ( [ nc - particle ] ) are an inner automorphism of the algebra @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the infinitesimal form of ( [ p - inner ] ) is given by @xmath69 = - i \\hbar \\big\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{f}}{\\partial x^i } \\big\\rangle , \\quad    [ x^i , \\widehat{f } ] = i \\hbar \\big\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{f}}{\\partial p_i } \\big\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath70 indicates a symmetric weyl ordering .",
    "the exactly same mathematical structure will also appear in the noncommutative spacetime ( [ nc - spacetime ] ) where translations are an inner automorphism of the noncommutative @xmath71-algebra @xmath20 , i.e.,@xcite @xmath72 for any @xmath73 .",
    "what is a duality resulting from this inner automorphism ?",
    "first , let us expose that the noncommutative spactime ( [ nc - spacetime ] ) introduces a new kind of duality between gauge theory and gravity.@xcite in order to illuminate the issue in a broad context , let us return to the system ( [ trio ] ) of physical constants .",
    "we believe that all the four interactions in nature , gravitational , electromagnetic , weak and strong forces , will be unified into a single force at the planck scale ( [ trio ] ) .",
    "so it may be more natural to treat gauge theory on an equal footing with gravity in the system ( [ trio ] ) which is missing the gauge theory counterpart .",
    "for the reason , consider the quartet of physical constants by adding a coupling constant @xmath74 which is the electric charge but sometimes it will be denoted with @xmath75 to refer to a general gauge coupling constant . using the symbol @xmath76 for length , @xmath77 for time , @xmath3 for mass , and writing @xmath78 $ ] for the dimensions of some physical quantity @xmath79 , we have the following in @xmath80 dimensions @xmath81 = m l^2 t^{-1 } , \\qquad \\qquad [ c ] = l t^{-1 } , \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ e^2 ] = m l^{d-1 }",
    "t^{-2 } , \\qquad [ g ] = m^{-1 } l^{d-1 } t^{-2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a remarkable point of the system ( [ quartet ] ) is that it specifies the following intrinsic scales independently of dimensions @xcite : @xmath82 , \\quad l^2 = \\big [ \\frac{g \\hbar^2}{e^2 c^2 } \\big ] , \\quad t^2 = \\big [ \\frac{g \\hbar^2}{e^2 c^4 } \\big].\\ ] ] from the four dimensional case where @xmath83 , we can see that the scales in ( [ 3-quartet ] ) are not so different from the planck scales in ( [ trio ] ) .",
    "note that the first relation @xmath84 in ( [ 3-quartet ] ) implies that at the mass scale @xmath3 the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions become of equal strength .",
    "then , the length @xmath76 in eq.([3-quartet ] ) is the compton wavelength of mass @xmath3 where the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions have the same strength , which turns out to be the scale of spacetime noncommutativity where the conspiracy between gravity and gauge theory takes place .",
    "suppose that a gauge theory whose coupling constant is given by @xmath74 is defined in the noncommutative spacetime ( [ nc - spacetime ] ) .",
    "in this case , the noncommutative gauge theory bears an intrinsic length scale given by @xmath85 and then the quartet system ( [ 3-quartet ] ) implies that the newton constant @xmath47 can be determined by field theory parameters only , i.e.@xcite @xmath86 hinting an intimate correspondence between gravity and gauge theory . ) would be an analogue of the de broglie relation @xmath87 for the wave - particle duality .",
    "the de broglie relation is possible because quantum mechanics has a conversion factor @xmath28 with the physical dimension of length times momentum . likewise ,",
    "if spacetime is noncommutative and so the theory equips with a dimensionful parameter @xmath88 of @xmath1 , the relation ( [ coupling - dual ] ) shows that the gravitational interaction can be inherited from a gauge field interaction , so leading to the gauge / gravity duality . ]",
    "this novel duality in noncommutative spacetime will be clarified in the next section .",
    "we have speculated in the previous section that , if spacetime @xmath3 admits a poisson structure such as ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) , there will be a novel duality between riemannian geometry @xmath5 and poisson geometry @xmath9 .",
    "now we will briefly sketch how this remarkable duality can be true .",
    "we refer to ref .   and a recent review@xcite for a full exposition .",
    "see also refs . and references therein for related discussions .",
    "to simplify the argument , let us assume that the poisson structure @xmath89 in ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) is nondegenerate at any point @xmath90 .",
    "then , we can invert this map to obtain the map @xmath91 , which is called a symplectic structure of @xmath3 , i.e. , a nondegenerate closed 2-form , @xmath92 , in @xmath93 .",
    "the pair @xmath94 is called a symplectic manifold .",
    "now consider an arbitrary deformation of the symplectic geometry @xmath95 by adding an arbitrary 2-form @xmath96 such that @xmath97 .",
    "but we will require that the resulting geometry after the deformation is still symplectic , i.e. @xmath98 .",
    "then , according to the poincar lemma , the closed 2-form @xmath99 can locally be written as @xmath7 where @xmath100 is an arbitrary one - form . because the original symplectic structure @xmath101 is a nondegenerate and closed 2-form , the associated map @xmath102 is a vector bundle isomorphism .",
    "therefore , there exists a natural pairing @xmath103 between @xmath104-sections of tangent and cotangent bundles .",
    "note that @xmath105 is an arbitrary vector field so that @xmath106 is an arbitrary one - form for a given @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we can identify @xmath107 and so @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the lie derivative along the flow of a vector field @xmath79 . to conclude",
    ", the deformation of symplectic geometry @xmath95 in terms of an arbitrary closed 2-form @xmath99 can be represented as @xmath110    the result ( [ def - symp ] ) shows that a smooth family @xmath111 of symplectic structures joining @xmath112 to @xmath113 is all deformation - equivalent and there exists a map @xmath114 as a flow  a one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms  generated by the vector field @xmath115 satisfying @xmath116 such that @xmath117 for all @xmath118 .",
    "this can be explicitly checked by considering a local darboux chart @xmath119 centered at @xmath120 and valid on an open neighborhood @xmath121 such that @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a constant symplectic matrix of rank @xmath61 .",
    "now consider a flow @xmath124 \\to m$ ] generated by the vector field @xmath115 . under the action of @xmath125 with an infinitesimal @xmath126",
    ", we find that a point @xmath120 whose coordinate is @xmath127 is mapped to @xmath128 .",
    "using the inverse map @xmath129 , the symplectic structure @xmath130 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath131 dx^\\mu \\wedge dx^\\nu \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & b + \\epsilon f\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 or @xmath133 and @xmath134 was used for the vanishing of the second term .",
    "equation ( [ moser ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath135 , which is exactly the result obtained from ( [ def - symp ] ) by taking @xmath136 .",
    "so far , @xmath137 in eq.([def - symp ] ) is an arbitrary closed 2-form deforming the original symplectic structure @xmath101 .",
    "now we make an important identification that the one - form @xmath100 is a connection of @xmath138 bundle supported on a symplectic manifold @xmath139 and @xmath140 as its curvature.@xcite to phrase in physics , we are considering electromagnetic fields @xmath7 defined on a symplectic manifold @xmath139 .",
    "this identification is consistent with the bianchi identity @xmath141 in electromagnetism .",
    "furthermore , the identification ( [ moser - eq ] ) is defined up to symplectomorphisms , i.e. , @xmath142 where @xmath143 and so @xmath144 , because it does not affect the symplectic structure @xmath113 or the curvature 2-form @xmath7 . from the gauge theory point of view",
    ", the symplectomorphisms can be identified with @xmath138 gauge transformations.@xcite in other words , the gauge symmetry acting on @xmath138 gauge fields as @xmath145 is generated by a hamiltonian vector field @xmath146 , i.e. , satisfying @xmath147 .",
    "so we arrive at an overwhelming evidence for the novel duality between riemannian geometry @xmath5 and symplectic geometry @xmath4.@xcite the first important point is that the @xmath138 gauge symmetry is a diffeomorphism symmetry generated by a vector field @xmath146 satisfying @xmath144 which is known as the symplectomorphism in symplectic geometry .",
    "therefore , the @xmath138 gauge symmetry on a symplectic manifold @xmath95 should be regarded as a spacetime symmetry rather than an internal symmetry .",
    "this result implies that @xmath138 gauge fields on a symplectic spacetime can be realized as a spacetime geometry like as gravity in general relativity.@xcite in general relativity , the equivalence principle beautifully explains why the gravitational force has to manifest itself as a spacetime geometry . if the gauge / gravity duality is realized in noncommutative spacetime , it is necessary to realize a corresponding equivalence principle for the geometrization of the electromagnetic force .",
    "note that we have already realized such a noble form of the equivalence principle in eq.([moser ] ) as follows.@xcite the presence of dynamical gauge fields on a symplectic manifold @xmath139 appears only as a deformation of the symplectic manifold @xmath139 such that the resulting symplectic structure is given by @xmath97 where @xmath140 .",
    "but the result ( [ def - symp ] ) immediately implies that the electromagnetic force @xmath140 can always be eliminated by a local coordinate transformation generated by a vector field @xmath79 satisfying ( [ moser - eq ] ) , as was explicitly shown in ( [ moser ] ) . remarkably , the poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) of spacetime admits the novel equivalence principle even for the electromagnetic force which turns out to be the crux of the gauge / gravity duality.@xcite this geometrization of the electromagnetism is inherent as an intrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the darboux theorem or the moser lemma.@xcite as a consequence , the electromagnetism on a symplectic spacetime can be realized as a geometrical property of spacetime like gravity . together with the cartan s magic formula @xmath148 . ]",
    "one overarching lesson we have learned so far is that the darboux theorem in symplectic geometry manifests itself as a novel form of the equivalence principle such that the electromagnetism on symplectic spacetime can be regarded as a theory of gravity .",
    "hence , the final touch for the gauge / gravity duality is to find an explicit map between electromagnetism and gravity.@xcite first , note that the @xmath138 gauge field ( [ moser - eq ] ) deforming an underlying symplectic structure is completely encoded into a local trivialization of the symplectic structure up to symplectomorphisms via the darboux theorem or the moser lemma.@xcite let us denote the local coordinate transformation @xmath149 as @xmath150 where the local coordinates @xmath151 will be assumed to be darboux coordinates so that the poisson bracket @xmath152 is a constant matrix of rank @xmath61 .",
    "the argument ( [ moser ] ) shows that such darboux coordinates always exist .",
    "it is well - known@xcite that , for a given poisson algebra @xmath153 , there exists a natural map @xmath154 between smooth functions in @xmath19 and vector fields in @xmath155 such that @xmath156 for any @xmath157 .",
    "that is , we can obtain a vector field @xmath158 from a smooth function @xmath159 defined at @xmath90 where @xmath160 . as long as @xmath161 in ( [ vec - map ] ) is a poisson structure of @xmath3 , the assignment ( [ vec - map ] ) between a hamiltonian function @xmath162 and the corresponding hamiltonian vector field @xmath163 is the lie algebra homomorphism in the sense @xmath164\\ ] ] where the right - hand side represents the lie bracket between the hamiltonian vector fields .    from the above arguments",
    ", we see that @xmath138 gauge fields on a symplectic manifold @xmath165 have been transformed into a set of smooth functions @xmath166 through the coordinate transformation ( [ darboux - coord ] ) .",
    "thus , we can apply the map ( [ vec - map ] ) to embody the lie algebra homomorphism ( [ poisson - lie ] ) from the poisson algebra @xmath62 for the set ( [ set - cc ] ) to the lie algebra @xmath167)$ ] of vector fields defined by @xmath168 for any @xmath159 .",
    "the vector fields @xmath169 in ( [ lie - vector ] ) take values in the lie algebra of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms because @xmath170 by definition . but",
    "it can be shown that the vector fields @xmath171 are related to the orthonormal frames ( vielbeins ) @xmath172 by @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , we see that the darboux theorem in symplectic geometry implements a deep principle to realize a riemannian manifold as an emergent geometry from symplectic gauge fields through the correspondence ( [ vec - map ] ) whose metric is given by @xmath175 where @xmath176 are dual one - forms.@xcite    note that the emergent metric ( [ emergent - metric ] ) is completely determined by the set ( [ set - cc ] ) of @xmath138 gauge fields and it describes any riemannian manifold with a fixed asymptotic background . for example , the asymptotic background geometry is a flat euclidean space @xmath177 if @xmath178 in ( [ set - cc ] ) are asymptotically vanishing fluctuations in four dimensions while it becomes a hyper - khler manifold if @xmath178 describe a noncommutative @xmath138 instanton.@xcite",
    "let us recapitulate how we could get the riemannian metric ( [ emergent - metric ] ) . we have considered electromagnetism on a symplectic spacetime @xmath95 . the electromagnetic fields in this case",
    "manifest themselves only as a deformation of symplectic structure such that the resulting symplectic spacetime is described by @xmath179 where @xmath7 . via the darboux theorem",
    "together with the homomorphism ( [ vec - map ] ) , this deformation of symplectic structure in terms of the electromagnetic force @xmath7 can be translated into a deformation of frame bundle over spacetime manifold @xmath3 ; @xmath180 , or , in terms of dual frames , @xmath181 .",
    "that is , the deformations of symplectic spacetime @xmath139 in terms of electromagnetic force @xmath7 are isomorphic to those of riemannian manifold",
    "@xmath64 @xmath182 this isomorphism implies that a field theory equipped with the fields in ( [ set - cc ] ) on a symplectic or poisson spacetime gives rise to einstein gravity.@xcite another crucial point , as will be shown below , is that an underlying field theory action for emergent gravity will be represented only by the poisson bracket @xmath183 between the fields in ( [ set - cc ] ) , and so the equations of motion will be defined only with the poisson bracket ( [ st - bracket ] ) .",
    "if this is the case , quantum gravity will be much more accessible since there is a natural symplectic or poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) and so it is obvious how to quantize the underlying system , as was already done in ( [ qm - bracket ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate the emergent gravity with the following action @xmath184 where @xmath75 is a @xmath61-dimensional gauge coupling constant .",
    "note that @xmath185 and @xmath186 it is easy to see by identifying @xmath187 and @xmath188 and using the relation ( [ poisson - dd ] ) that the lie algebra homomorphism ( [ poisson - lie ] ) leads to the following identity @xmath189\\ ] ] where @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",

    "therefore classical gravity is defined by the action ( [ symp - action ] ) and the so - called emergent gravity suggests a novel and authentic way for quantum gravity where the quantization of gravity is reduced to quantizing a dynamical system described by the action ( [ symp - action]).@xcite with the poisson structure ( [ spacetime - poisson ] ) , who is still in agony to find a quantum world",
