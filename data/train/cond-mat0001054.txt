    "in the last decades , @xmath0 intermetallic compounds have received a lot of attention both in theory and experiment . on one side , these systems can exhibit a large variety of behaviors , such as superconductivity , huge magnetoresistance , itinerant magnetism , etc . on the other side ,",
    "the nature of the @xmath1 states is controversial since it has not been established yet which systems can be treated using a bandlike picture and which ones using a localized one . in the first picture , the effective electronic correlation is weak and the @xmath1 states form a narrow band@xcite , while in the second one , the @xmath1 electrons are highly correlated and interact weakly with the conduction band@xcite .",
    "the main difference between @xmath0 and other rare earth systems is that , in the case of ce , the @xmath1 state is energetically very close to the fermi level so that its occupation number and the strength of hybridization with the conduction electron bands strongly depend on the chemical and geometrical environment . in that sense",
    ", we can understand the complexity of the phase diagram of pure metallic @xmath0 which , depending on temperature and pressure , can be magnetic , paramagnetic or superconducting@xcite . due to this fact , different types of magnetism have been observed within the intermetallic compounds : intermediate valence behavior , kondo effect and magnetic ordered structures ( fm , af ) are among them@xcite .",
    "intermediate valence behavior appears in systems having the states with @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath1 electrons almost degenerate . the nearly degenerate condition is a consequence of hybridization of the @xmath1 states and results in a configuration with a non integer electronic occupation number @xmath4 . in general ,",
    "intermediate valence materials show anomalous values for some physical properties such as lattice parameter , bulk modulus , magnetic susceptibility , etc , as compared to systems with an integer @xmath1 occupation number .",
    "the intermediate valence behavior in @xmath0 compounds is characterized by having a very small or zero magnetic moment@xcite .",
    "the different physical situations posed by these systems have been traditionally described by many body hamiltonians which consider strong electron - electron interactions and treat hybridization as a small perturbation .",
    "kondo systems , for which correlations are dominant , have to be treated with these model hamiltonians . in @xmath0 intermetallics ,",
    "particularly , it is not clear at all how important the relative strength of hybridization and correlations are .",
    "there are systems whose electronic ground state can be well described by an itinerant picture , namely those in which @xmath1 hybridization plays a relevant role giving rise to a decrease in correlation effects@xcite .    in this work",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "first we want to use the band picture to establish a criterion for characterizing the ground state of @xmath0 intermetallic compounds by analysing their lda spin contribution to the magnetic moment . as a second goal , and using for this the established criterion as a tool , we also want to analyse the dependence of the magnetism of @xmath0 on geometrical and chemical environment . for this",
    "we study a variety of @xmath0 compounds , whose magnetic properties are experimentally well known .",
    "we claim that it is possible to determine to which regime the system under study belongs .",
    "that is , if we are dealing with strongly hybridized or strongly localized systems , going through the intermediate situations , by analysing the itinerant magnetic contribution that results from spin polarized lda calculations .",
    "this analysis is certainly done in the knowledge that only those @xmath0 compounds whose @xmath1 states are essentially itinerant can be well described within the lda band theory frame . actually , a proper treatment for the @xmath1 electrons would be to include the self - interaction correction ( sic)@xcite in the calculations but this is not necessary for the kind of description undertaken in this work .",
    "once we have established our characterization tool , we discuss the relative importance of chemical and crystalline environment on hybridization and thereafter on the determination of the magnetic state of intermetallic systems of the type @xmath5 with @xmath2 equal or larger than one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we report the results of calculations done for several real systems and present a discussion of how the lda approximation can be used to classify them into magnetic , intermediate valence or paramagnetic compounds . in the second part of this section we analyse the influence of chemical and structural environment on the magnetic ground state of @xmath0 compounds .",
    "we finally present the conclusions in sec .",
    "in this work we perform _ ab - initio _ calculations using the full potential linearized augmented plane waves ( fp - lapw ) method in the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite .",
    "we use the exchange and correlation potential of j.p .",
    "perdew and y. wang@xcite .",
    "we make both paramagnetic and spin polarized calculations .",
    "the sampling of the brillouin zone used to calculate the electronic ground state depends on the size and symmetry of each system . in general , from 800 to 1400 k - points in the first brillouin zone are enough for convergence .",
    "the considered _ muffin tin _ radios , @xmath6 , are equal to 2.8 au for ce , 2.4 au for @xmath7 transition metals ( tm ) , 2.0 au for @xmath8 transition metals ( tm ) , 1.8 au for s and 1.6 au for n. the cutoff parameter which gives the number of plane waves in the interstitial region is taken as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the maximun value of the reciprocal lattice vector used in the expansion of plane waves in that zone .",
    "the total energy is converged up to @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 has one @xmath1 electron in the solid . as we have mentioned before , the energy of this @xmath1 state is very close to the fermi level so that it is , in principle , very sensitive to chemical and geometrical environment . in some compounds",
    "@xmath0 keeps its magnetic moment equal to 1 @xmath12 and in others it can decrease even going to zero . in this section we establish a way of characterizing @xmath0 compounds which allows us to classify them into magnetic , intermediate valence or paramagnetic by doing lda spin polarized calculations . to achieve this we study compounds whose magnetic properties",
    "have already been reported and are listed in table i.    @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are accepted to be intermediate valence compounds@xcite while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are well described by an itinerant picture@xcite , being paramagnetic .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are magnetically ordered systems .",
    "table i contains the structural data and the experimental ordering temperatures , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which correspond to the curie and nel temperatures depending on whether the compounds are ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "no magnetic order has been experimentally observed for the cases where no ordering temperature is shown@xcite .    in our calculations three types of magnetic configurations",
    "are possible : paramagnetic ( p ) , ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic(af ) . in table",
    "i we also list the more stable configuration and the obtained lda magnetic moment of @xmath0 for the different compounds .",
    "the calculations are performed at the experimental volumes shown in the same table .",
    "the obtained magnetic moments for the compounds @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are far from being 1@xmath12 but they are clearly not zero so that we can not consider them as being paramagnetic . in that sense it is not surprising that these compounds are those which are widely accepted to be intermediate valence systems . an intermediate valence system is usually defined in the literature as one having in the average a non integer number of @xmath1 electrons .",
    "it is very important to keep in mind that lda calculations can not account for the strong correlation effects that may occur in some rare earth compounds .",
    "however , we can infer from their itinerant contribution and using lda the correct ground state for the systems studied here .",
    "based on the comparison of experimental data and our lda results , we propose that , depending on the lda magnetic moment , a @xmath0 compound can be considered as    itinerant if @xmath24 ,    intermediate valence if @xmath25    or    magnetic if @xmath26 .    the systems that are accepted to be itinerant , such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are the ones whose magnetic moment is exactly equal to zero .",
    "that is , when in a given @xmath0 system the magnetic moment is zero the @xmath1 electrons have a strong itinerant character .    in @xmath0 compounds",
    "the degree of localization is closely related to the strength of @xmath0 hybridization and consequently to the magnetic state .",
    "let us take two extreme situations as examples , @xmath17 and @xmath20 . in figure 1",
    "we show an electronic charge density plot corresponding to one of the kohn - sham orbitals with energy close to the fermi level and with @xmath27 of @xmath1 character . in the @xmath17 case",
    ", there is a mixing between @xmath28 and @xmath0 states near @xmath29 while , this is not the case for @xmath20 , as can be clearly seen in figure 1 .",
    "we can also analyse the degree of hybridization by comparing @xmath1 and @xmath7 partial densities of states ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the most striking difference between @xmath17 and @xmath20 systems is that in the last one , the @xmath7 and @xmath1 bands are approximately 4 ev apart being both of them very narrow , of the order of 1ev , while in @xmath17 , the @xmath7 band is more extended in energy ( about 4ev ) , leading to an energy region around the fermi level where hybridization is important .",
    "thus , taking into account the calculated magnetic moments and using the established criterion , we say that in the compound where the @xmath1 band is more hybridized , namely @xmath17 , the @xmath1 band turns more delocalized leading thus to a non magnetic ce .",
    "this should hold in general .",
    "@xmath0 can completely or partially loose its magnetic moment depending on chemical and crystalline environment . in this section",
    "we study how @xmath1 hybridization affects the @xmath0 magnetic moment depending on the local symmetry and the chemistry of the ligand .",
    "the @xmath1 band hybridizes not only with @xmath1 electrons of neighboring @xmath0 sites but also with orbitals of the ligand ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath30 bands ) . both types of hybridization produce a decrease in the magnetic moment of ce .    for the symmetry considerations , we compare systems of the type @xmath31 ( x = ni , rh , pd ) and analyse them in the crb and cscl crystal structures .",
    "these structures are being taken as prototypes of different symmetries within the same relative composition . actually , both structures appear in nature associated with @xmath31 compounds . in general ,",
    "when x is a latter tm the observed structure is crb and when x belongs to the 1b , 2b or the 3a column of the periodic table the corresponding structure is the cscl one .",
    "the calculation for a given @xmath31 system in both the crb and the cscl structures helps us to understand how local symmetry affects @xmath1 hybridization and consequently the magnetization of ce .",
    "the calculations within the crb structure are performed at the experimental equilibrium volume at room temperature and , since the cscl structures are hypothetical ones for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath19 , we take the same volume per atom as in crb in order to be able to compare the outcoming magnetic properties .    from table",
    "ii we see that the cscl structure favours magnetism , even if slightly , as compared to the crb one .",
    "this is a consequence of cscl having higher symmetry .",
    "crystal field effects lead , in the crb case , to a lifting of almost all of the @xmath1 degeneracies while this is not the case in the cscl structure . within a quasi-stoner image cscl favours magnetism due to a higher density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this is coherent with the fact that only some of the crb compounds are magnetic while all of the cscl ones are magnetic .",
    "figure 3 shows charge density plots with contributions stemming from the energy range @xmath32 , where @xmath29 is the fermi energy . in this range",
    "the @xmath1 band is the most important one .",
    "the plots show , for the @xmath14 system , the charge densities projected into the ( 010 ) plane for crb and into the ( 110 ) one for cscl . in the crb structure the @xmath1-@xmath1 hybridization between neighboring @xmath0 sites is more important than the @xmath1-@xmath7 or @xmath1-@xmath8 hybridization between @xmath0 and tm atoms .",
    "this can be infered from the fact that there is more charge between @xmath0 atoms than between @xmath0 and tm , namely a weight of 0.02 in crb as compared to 0.007 in cscl . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath33 hybridization is stronger in cscl than in crb .",
    "the amount of total interstitial charge is practically the same in both structures : crb and cscl structures have 4.4 and 4.3 interstitial electrons per formula unit respectively .",
    "the difference among them comes from the spatial distribution of charge .    for the systems under study which crystallize in the cscl structure , symmetry makes a contribution to the magnetic moment of @xmath0 , but it is actually not the crystalline environment the determining factor for the magnetic behavior .",
    "it is rather the chemical nature of the ligands the one that is responsible for this magnetic result .",
    "considering for instance , the @xmath20 or @xmath21 system from the previous section , which crystallize in the cscl structure , the 4d band lies very low in energy and thereafter there is nearly no hybridization betwen @xmath1-@xmath7 bands , leading this to the magnetization of ce . in the hypothetical situation that one could force these systems to crystallize in the crb structure",
    "they would also be magnetic .",
    "on the other hand , if we compare the magnetization of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath19 focusing on the crb structure , which is the real one for these compounds , we can get insight into the effect that the type of ligand has on the magnetic moment of @xmath0 . using our criterion",
    "@xmath19 is a magnetically ordered system , while @xmath14 and @xmath13 are not when considered in their natural crb structure . in figure 4",
    "we show the densities of states for the three compounds .",
    "the different magnetic solutions within the same crystalline structure can be explained , by the fact that in @xmath14 the @xmath7 band is closer in energy to the fermi level than in the @xmath34 compound and consequently @xmath1-@xmath7 hybridization is stronger .",
    "the more the @xmath1 band hybridizes with the @xmath7 band the smaller is the @xmath0 magnetic moment . on the other hand ,",
    "in the @xmath13 case , there is an interplay between two types of hybridization namely @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath35 , both induce a decrease of the magnetism of ce as compared to @xmath19 .",
    "actually , in @xmath13 , there is a reduction in volume and @xmath0 atoms are nearer to each other than in cepd .",
    "consequently , as can be seen from the densities of states in figure 4 , the @xmath1 band is 0.5 ev wider in @xmath13 than in @xmath19 due to an increase in @xmath0-@xmath0 mixing . on the other side ,",
    "the @xmath8 band lies nearer to @xmath29 than the @xmath7 one this giving rise to @xmath1-@xmath8 mixing . due to this interplay @xmath13 is the less magnetic compound among the crb systems .",
    "in this contribution using an itinerant picture we show that it is possible to characterize the magnetic ground state of @xmath0 intermetallic compounds by doing _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations within the lda approximation .",
    "this criterion allows us to classify them into magnetically ordered , intermediate valence or paramagnetic systems trough their calculated spin contributions to the @xmath0 magnetic moment .",
    "it is based on the band theory frame in which , in general , correlated @xmath0 systems are not well described .",
    "however we find that it is an usefull tool to obtaine qualitative information about the electronic ground state of a wide variety of @xmath0 compounds , including those with strong electronic correlations .",
    "we study the importance of @xmath1 hybridization in determining the magnetic state of @xmath0 by analysing both symmetry and chemical effects .",
    "we study first the influence of the symmetry environment on @xmath1 hybridization in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath19 and take cscl and crb as prototypes of high and low symmetry structures .",
    "we see that cscl slightly favour magnetism as compared to crb .",
    "this fact can be understood with the following argument : crb s local environment has less symmetry operations than cscl ( 8 vs. 48 ) and consequently there is a lifting of @xmath1 degeneracies giving rise to a smaller density of states at the fermi energy . within a stoner picture",
    "there is a stronger instability for magnetism in cscl than in crb . in this sense",
    "we can understand the fact that all the systems with the formula unit cex are magnetic when growing in the cscl structure ( with x belonging to the 1b , 2b and 3a column of the periodic table ) but they are not when growing in the crb , in which only @xmath19 and @xmath36 are magnetically ordered .",
    "noteworthy is the fact that , in the cases studied , local symmetry is not a determining factor for the magnetic behavior .",
    "it is actually the type of ligand the crucial factor to determine the magnetic state . along this line",
    ", we focus our study on the crb structure to analyse the effect of chemical environment .",
    "we conclude that both @xmath1-@xmath33 and @xmath1-@xmath1 types of hybridization can lead to a decrease of @xmath0 magnetic moment in the systems @xmath14 and @xmath13 with respect to @xmath19 . in the first case it is mainly",
    "the mixing between the @xmath7 band of @xmath28 with the @xmath1 one from @xmath0 what produces a strong decrease in the magnetic moment . in the second case , @xmath13 , both types of hybridization occur , resulting this in an even lower value of the magnetic moment of @xmath0 .",
