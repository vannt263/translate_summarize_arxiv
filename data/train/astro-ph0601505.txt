    "a re - analysis using only high - quality rotation curves confirmed the shallower distant tf slope , showing that our findings are not induced by perturbated or truncated rotation curves .",
    "we also tested whether a slope change could be mimicked by an incompleteness effect arising from the apparent magnitude limit in our target selection . towards higher redshifts",

    "a fraction of the low ",
    "luminosity , low  mass ( slowly rotating ) spiral population is therefore missed in the selection process , while the low  mass galaxies that _ are _ selected might preferentially be located at the high  luminosity side of the relation .",

    "[ zbins ] that the magnitude limit of our survey affects the covered luminosity ranges in the intermediate- and high - redshift bin . in the low - redshift bin ( @xmath54 )",
    ", the lack of galaxies with @xmath65 seems less likely to be induced by the @xmath17 selection . in the following , we aim at a quantitative estimate of the impact of sample incompleteness on the tf analysis .",
    "the key factor for the strength of this selection effect is the scatter of the tfr , which has a value of @xmath66 in the @xmath10-band of the local pt92 sample . in a previous analysis @xcite",

    "similar to the technique described by @xcite , a schechter luminosity function ( lf ) form was fitted to the observed luminosity distribution , with the characteristic luminosity @xmath68 and the space density @xmath69 as free parameters . at the faint end of the luminosity function , where our sample is incomplete ,",
