    "the environment of a galaxy has long been known to influence its properties , such as morphology , color , and star formation .",
    "numerous investigations showed that galaxy populations in rich cluster environments were dominated by red elliptical and s0 galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite , in particular , postulated that more evolved clusters hosted a larger proportion of early - type galaxies , suggesting a link between galaxy properties and the buildup of clusters .",
    "@xcite subsequently studied a diverse set of clusters and made the key discovery that at a fixed local density , relaxed and un - relaxed clusters host a similar fraction of early - type galaxies and that this fraction increased at higher local densities .",
    "dressler s morphology - density relation ( mdr ) challenged the long - standing role of ram - pressure stripping @xcite in transforming field spirals into cluster early - types galaxies , and instead pointed to the importance of local processes . in recent years",
    ", studies have probed into the lower density environments that are characteristic of groups @xcite and the field galaxy population @xcite , and found the local environment to be an important factor there as well . in general , these studies found the _",
    "lowest _ density environments to be comprised of lower mass , blue , late - type galaxies , a stark contrast to the types of galaxies found at higher densities .",
    "studies of galaxy properties and their dependencies on local environment are key to understanding the mechanisms that are responsible for galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , in the high density cluster environment processes like ram pressure stripping @xcite and harassment @xcite may suppress star formation and consequently evolve galaxies towards the red - sequence . at intermediate densities that are characteristic of the group environment ,",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions and mergers are more probable , given the favorable relative velocities of galaxies @xcite .",
    "early hst observations of distant clusters revealed tidal interactions of blue disk galaxies , implying a strong role for galaxy - galaxy interactions in forming present day cluster ellipticals @xcite .",
    "an analysis of galaxy properties in different environments can therefore shed light on the processes responsible for the observed buildup of the red - sequence between @xmath13 and today @xcite .",
    "for example , given that cluster galaxies comprise a small fraction of their @xmath13 sample , @xcite argue against processes such as ram pressure stripping and harassment as the sole origin of the observed color - density trend found at low redshift . instead , they suggest that processes that form the high early - type fraction in @xmath14 groups of galaxies dominate red - sequence formation at higher redshifts .",
    "the outskirts of _ massive _ clusters present an ideal location to study the impact of environment on galaxy properties over a broad range of local densities : from the high density cluster core to the intermediate density groups in the outskirts and the low density surrounding field .",
    "furthermore , the findings of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the morphological makeup of galaxies changes dramatically at the intermediate densities found in the outskirts of clusters . these mass - limited studies",
    "found that while in the cores of clusters the fraction of early - type galaxies is high and does not evolve significantly between @xmath13 and @xmath15 , the early - type fraction ( etf ) for galaxies in the low density field is lower and also does not evolve .",
    "because clusters grow by accreting galaxies from the field , and massive clusters are expected to grow by a factor of @xmath16 in mass between @xmath13 and @xmath15 @xcite , the large reservoir of infalling galaxies from the field must transform in the outskirts of clusters in order to preserve the high etf found in the high density core .",
    "thus , the outskirts of massive clusters provide an opportunity to assemble a large sample of galaxies in environments where we expect transformations to be occurring .",
    "studying the properties of galaxies in the environments of clusters at intermediate redshifts has several advantages . at such redshifts , around @xmath17 , at a lookback time of @xmath18  gyr ,",
    "a number of clusters exist where the formation of a massive cluster out of the large scale structure can be witnessed .",
    "this is an epoch of rapid buildup in the cluster population .",
    "observations of the evolution of the cluster mass function indicate that the _ number _ of massive clusters increases by a factor of a few since such redshifts @xcite . in addition , as noted above , simulations suggest that individual clusters grow in _ mass _ by a factor of @xmath16 over the same time period @xcite .",
    "this changing landscape therefore allows one to study the properties of galaxy populations that will transform , evolve , and assemble into the present day cluster population . on much smaller physical scales ,",
    "the star forming activity in galaxies was also different at these intermediate redshifts .",
    "in general , galaxies formed stars at a higher rate in the past @xcite , particularly higher mass galaxies that will have ceased star formation by the present epoch @xcite .",
    "_ at a redshift of @xmath17 , the contrast between star - forming and non - star - forming galaxies is accentuated , allowing us to better highlight those environments that influence star formation . _",
    "we focus in this paper on a mass - limited sample for this important epoch of cluster mass growth .",
    "luminosity - limited samples selected in the rest - frame uv include many bright , low mass , star forming galaxies as a result of the large scatter in their mass - to - light ratios at a fixed galaxy stellar mass .",
    "selecting by stellar mass thus provides a more well - defined and homogeneous sample .    in this paper",
    ", we study the colors of galaxies in the @xmath0 cluster rx  j0152.7 - 1357  ( hereafter rx  j0152 - 13 ) and its outskirts .",
    "this is a very rich cluster with extensive imaging and spectroscopic datasets that now cover a very wide area ( out to @xmath19  mpc in radius ) . as such it is an ideal target for a study of galaxy evolution and transformation over a wide range of densities , from the core to the field .",
    "our initial spectroscopic sample of members is currently @xmath20 objects .",
    "these galaxies are the focus of our first paper on this cluster .",
    "such samples are becoming large enough to provide robust constraints on cluster galaxy properties ( e.g. mass functions , star formation rates , morphologies , environmental trends , etc ) .",
    "the use of spectroscopic redshifts , as opposed to photometric ones , ensures that our membership list , and therefore results , do not suffer from the systematics that trouble photometric surveys .",
    "ultimately we expect to reach 2000 - 3000 spectroscopic members between two clusters at @xmath17 .",
    "the remarkable feat employs the new low - dispersion prism ( ldp ) in the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on the baade 6.5  m telescope at magellan ( see below for more details ) , further enhancing our insight into galaxy evolution in a variety of environments at @xmath17 .    in ",

    "imacs provided a spectral resolving power of @xmath42 over a corresponding wavelength range of 4500  @xmath43 9000   .",
    "the data were taken using nod & shuffle for sky subtraction @xcite with the slits being just long enough to accommodate two object spectra ( a and b ) with each nod .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using helium lamp exposures taken between science frames , providing nearly a dozen features from 3888    to 10,830   .",
    "the positions of the lines were solved for simultaneously in order to account for blending .",
    "we then constructed mappings of wavelength to position on the ccd using trivariate polynomials of slit mask position and wavelength .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were constructed by simultaneously extracting the a and b pairs using an optimal extraction technique similar to @xcite .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated .",
    "we used a total of 5 slitmasks , each with @xmath332000 slits .",
    "the first 3 masks selected galaxies from our suprime - cam photometry catalog with @xmath4  @xmath44  23  mag , while the last 2 went deeper to @xmath4  @xmath44  23.75  mag .",
    "roughly @xmath45 of the objects had @xmath46  hrs of exposure and @xmath47 had @xmath48  hrs of exposure .",
    "the cumulative time of observing all 5 masks would have been equivalent to about 3 nights on the telescope .",
    "the efficiency of this setup is clear and allows us to obtain an order of magnitude more redshifts per night compared to traditional multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "we stress that _ no priors , such as red - sequence membership or photometric redshifts , were implemented in our spectroscopic selection , thereby minimizing biases in our sample_. observations with the ldp are ongoing and we therefore plan to discuss a larger and more complete sample of cluster galaxies in a future paper .",
    "until now , surveys of clusters at high redshift have relied , to some degree , on photometric redshifts ( photo - z s ) to build samples large enough to conduct studies with adequate statistics @xcite .",
    "such studies have suggested that selection effects associated with photo - z s must be considered when interpreting results .",
    "for instance , @xcite show that photo - z s for blue galaxies are systematically lower than their spectroscopic values , and in the case of rx  j0152 - 13 , results in a deficit of such galaxies in the cluster . with the ldp , we are able to avoid both the systematics and the catastrophic redshift failures that complicate photometric studies . a detailed discussion of the methodology and errors of ldp redshift determinations will be presented in a future paper ( patel et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) but is summarized here .",
    "the ldp spectra are low resolution grism spectra taken through short slitlets .",
    "the advantage of this observing technique is that spectra for very large samples of galaxies can be obtained quickly .",
    "the resolution varies from @xmath49    in the blue to @xmath50    in the red ( for fwhm  @xmath51  pixels ) .",
    "such low resolution requires non - standard data reduction and processing in order to recover accurate redshifts .",
    "however , as shown below through comparison with a substantial sample of galaxies observed spectroscopically at higher resolution , this technique has proven to return large numbers of spectra quickly and reliably , and has great potential for future studies of intermediate and high redshift galaxies .",
    "redshifts for the ldp sample of galaxies were determined by simultaneously fitting the suprime - cam photometry and ldp spectrophotometry with a grid of template spectra generated using ( * ? ? ? * bc03 ) .",
    "the templates used constant star formation models with the onset of star formation occurring at @xmath52 .",
    "the grid of template spectra was constructed as a function of 3 parameters : redshift , metallicity , and truncation time .",
    "the truncation times span a wide range in order to mimic galaxies that are passively evolving to constantly star - forming .",
    "the fitting included a non - negative gaussian component at the position of [ oii ]  3727   .",
    "at each grid point , a non - negative least squares algorithm was used to fit the stellar and [ oii ]  3727    components to the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a given galaxy .",
    "the quality of the fit at each grid point was determined by @xmath53 .",
    "the template spectra were convolved with the prism s wavelength - dependent resolution and dispersion prior to fitting the observations .",
    "we note that more recent trials of sed fitting have tested the inclusion of varying amounts of extinction due to dust but no discernible difference in redshifts have been found .",
    "we plan to discuss [ oii ]  3727    measurements from the sed fitting in a future paper .",
    "we use a likelihood analysis to identify members of the rx  j0152 - 13  superstructure . the redshift likelihood function for each galaxy",
    "is defined such that the probability density at a given redshift , @xmath54 , is proportional to @xmath53 of the template fit to the sed in the following way : @xmath55 , and the likelihood for a galaxy to be in the redshift range @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 .",
    "the redshift likelihood function is then used to find all galaxies with @xmath5850% of their likelihood within the redshift interval @xmath40 .",
    "this redshift interval has been used in previous studies to discuss galaxies in rx  j0152 - 13  and its outskirts @xcite .",
    "ldp galaxies with redshifts in the range @xmath40  are shown as red circles in figure  [ map0152 ] .",
    "we found 649  galaxies in rx  j0152 - 13  and its outskirts with the ldp out of 7659 extracted spectra from the 5 masks ( roughly @xmath59 of these 7659 had well constrained redshifts ) .",
    "the median value for the full width of the 95% redshift confidence interval for the cluster members is @xmath60 , corresponding to a 1-@xmath35 uncertainty of @xmath61 . comparing 174  ldp redshifts , @xmath62 , to those derived from higher resolution spectra , @xmath63 , we find a scatter of @xmath64 , implying that our error estimates for ldp redshifts are robust .",
    "the histogram of @xmath65 is shown in figure  [ redshifts_hist ] .",
    "note that there is a small , but systematic offset from @xmath66 of @xmath67 , which is accounted for in assigning membership .",
    "the scatter for red - sequence galaxies , @xmath61 , is slightly smaller than galaxies with bluer colors , @xmath68 .",
    "of the 174 with measurements of both @xmath62  and @xmath63 , 4 ( 2.3% ) have @xmath63  outside of the cluster redshift interval but @xmath62  inside of it .",
    "however , none of these 4 galaxies deviate from the boundaries of the cluster interval by more than @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the catastrophic redshift failures known to trouble photometric redshift samples are substantially reduced for ldp - selected members .",
    "in addition , we expect the agreement between @xmath62  and @xmath63  to improve in the future as we refine the reduction and fitting of ldp spectra and track down systematic sources of uncertainty .",
    "we incorporate 105  additional members , from existing spectroscopic catalogs , that have not yet been observed with the ldp , to build a sample of 754  galaxies at the redshift of the cluster with @xmath4@xmath70  mag .",
    "to correct for the non - uniform depth of the selection between the first and second sets of spectroscopic data , we constructed the spectroscopic completeness as a 2-d function of @xmath4  and @xmath71 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig_completeness ] .",
    "galaxies are binned in @xmath4  in increments of 0.2  mag and in @xmath71  by 0.1  mag .",
    "the completeness fraction for a particular color and magnitude bin is given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the number of galaxies with sufficient constraints on their redshifts to assign membership and @xmath74 is the number of galaxies in the object catalog with @xmath4@xmath75  mag .",
    "this magnitude limit for the spectroscopic target selection is much brighter than the photometric limit of the suprime - cam catalog . in our analysis below we weigh each galaxy with the inverse of the completeness fraction in its color - magnitude bin .",
    "we transform colors and magnitudes to the rest - frame using the same method as @xcite and @xcite . using a range of @xmath76-model spectra from bc03",
    ", we calculate magnitudes in the rest - frame for the relevant filters used in this paper ( @xmath77@xmath78@xmath79 ) and in the observed redshifted frame using suprime - cam @xmath30@xmath31@xmath4@xmath32 .",
    "while these models are different from the constant star forming models used to fit seds and obtain redshifts , their use makes our rest - frame colors and magnitudes consistent with previous work .",
    "also , our results are not significantly affected by this choice .",
    "the ldp seds themselves are not used because they are lower s / n than the suprime - cam photometry and contain systematic uncertainties in their flux calibration . in creating our @xmath76-models ,",
    "we used metallicities of 0.4 , 1.0 , and 2.5 @xmath80 , @xmath81-folding timescales @xmath76 ranging from 0.1 to 5  gyr , and elapsed time since onset of star formation ranging from 0.5 to 6  gyr .",
    "these models span the colors seen in our observations for cluster members .",
    "suprime - cam @xmath30@xmath31@xmath4@xmath32  filter transmissions , multiplied by the quantum efficiency of the detector , were used for the observed transmission curves and buser s @xmath82 and @xmath30  @xcite and sdss @xmath77@xmath78  transmission curves @xcite supplied with bc03 were used for the rest - frame .",
    "the best - fit transformations from observed to rest - frame magnitudes and colors are given below .",
    "we follow the convention where rest - frame magnitudes and colors are subscripted with the letter ` @xmath83 ' .",

    "the conversion between the two systems for the suprime - cam @xmath31  filter is @xmath87 .",
    "the last term in each transformation , given in parentheses , corrects the derived rest - frame magnitudes for galactic extinction using the dust maps of @xcite .",

    "@xmath90 for selecting galaxies to compute local densities in   [ localdensities ] .",
    "the @xmath85  color is used to study stellar populations since this combination of filters straddles the 4000    break and is therefore sensitive to recent or ongoing star formation .",

    "finally , we would like to note that in this work quantities such as rest - frame color and mass - to - light ratio were not computed from the best - fitting truncation model template used to determine redshifts . instead , these quantities were computed from model star formation histories ( sfhs ) with exponentially declining star formation rates ( i.e. tau - models ) .",
    "this allowed comparison to previous work to be more accessible .",
    "for this paper , we viewed the redshift determination to be an independent task and therefore chose a sfh for the model templates that : ( 1 ) provided accurate redshifts and ( 2 ) optimized computing time given the large amount of data that needed to be processed ( truncated sfhs use one fewer free parameter than tau - models ) . in future work , we may explore integrating the entire process of redshift determination and extraction of rest - frame quantities .      the colors of galaxies provide insight into the ages of their stellar populations .",

    "the local environment , or local galaxy density , has been shown to play a role in the evolution of galaxies @xcite .",

    "the red galaxy fractions for both radial regimes are summarized in table  [ table_colordensity ] .    in the two cores ,",
    "the red galaxy fraction is near unity for all densities ( figure  [ colorfracdensity1]@xmath146 ) .",

    "the red galaxy fraction is similar to the value found in the two cores for the same density range .",
    "this suggests that galaxies in high density environments in the outskirts of clusters have already evolved by @xmath17 to be similar , and to occur in similar proportions , to galaxies that occupy the two cores .",
    "the presence of an increasing red galaxy fraction trend with local density implies that certain environments nurture or drive the transition from blue to red at a level above what is found in the field .",
    "the red galaxy fraction in the density range @xmath171 at @xmath12  mpc is between the value found in adjacent density bins : in the higher density bin , most galaxies are already evolved to the canonical core fraction while in the lower density bin , we have reached the field population level where the red fraction is low ( at @xmath172 for our sample ) .",
    "the density range @xmath171 therefore represents a regime where one expects the local environment to influence evolution above a level that is typical for the field and where star formation begins to shut off in galaxies , causing them to move towards redder colors .",
    "given the large number of galaxies at these densities , a potentially large sample exists of galaxies that are beginning to transition from blue to red in these particular environments .",
    "this sample will be a major resource for assessing the physical processes that drive galaxies from field - like galaxy properties to cluster - like galaxy properties .",
    "additional observations to complement galaxy colors , such as those that allow morphological identification , estimates of star formation rates , structural measurements and assessments of merger events would be useful in characterizing such galaxies .",
    "the simulations of @xcite suggest that massive clusters like rx  j0152 - 13  will grow by more than a factor of two in mass between @xmath17 and today .",
    "such massive clusters formed out of the highest density perturbations from the primordial fluctuations in the early universe . as a consequence , these high density perturbations were surrounded by intermediate density perturbations that have collapsed to form structures on the group mass scale that are subsequently accreted into the cluster .",
    "therefore , much of the mass buildup in massive clusters like rx  j0152 - 13  occurs through the accretion of nearby infalling groups .",
    "the n - body simulations of @xcite however , suggest that clusters grow primarily through the accretion of individual galaxies from the field",
    ". however , they also note that for more massive clusters , such as rx  j0152 - 13 , a larger proportion of galaxies are accreted as part of group sized halos .",
    "most of the galaxies above our mass limit at @xmath12  mpc and at high densities ( @xmath170 ) lie in two groups identified by @xcite .",
    "as in the two cluster cores , the fraction of red galaxies in these groups is @xmath173 .",
    "one group is located at a projected separation of @xmath174 ( @xmath51  mpc ) south of the cluster center and the other @xmath175 ( @xmath19  mpc ) southwest of the cluster center ( see figure  [ map0152 ] ) .",
    "@xcite refer to these systems as f4 and f6 respectively and measure velocity dispersions of @xmath176  km  s@xmath23  and @xmath177  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "their offsets in redshift from the cluster ( @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) imply relative velocities ( @xmath180 ) of @xmath181  km  s@xmath23  and @xmath182  km  s@xmath23 , which means that both are encompassed by the @xmath183 velocity dispersion of the northern core .",
    "if their redshift offsets instead are due to expansion with the hubble flow , the line of sight distance ( @xmath184 ) from the cluster would be @xmath185  mpc and @xmath186  mpc respectively .",
    "the f4 group is therefore very likely to be falling into the cluster and given that it has a projected distance from the cluster center of @xmath51  mpc , it would nt be unreasonable for the f6 group , with a projected distance of @xmath19  mpc , to also be falling into the cluster , though this outcome is less certain .",
    "evidence that the source of the constituent galaxies of massive clusters ( like rx  j0152 - 13 ) are groups in the outskirts has also been seen in previous work .",
    "@xcite found that assembling clusters at intermediate redshift had a high fraction of elliptical galaxies and was similar to the fraction found in virialized clusters , suggesting that many ellipticals were in place prior to virialization of massive clusters and probably formed earlier , in the group phase . at @xmath187",
    ", @xcite found that at least four gravitationally bound groups were in the process of collapsing to form a larger cluster . a higher proportion of galaxies in these groups were found to be passive when compared to the field , similar to our findings .",
    "others have also found groups or overdense regions in the outskirts of clusters to support galaxies with properties that are similar to those found among galaxies in cluster cores .",
    "for instance , @xcite found passive spirals in the outskirts of a @xmath188 cluster to be preferentially located in overdense regions , perhaps in transition to becoming s0s .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite found the morphological mix of overdense regions in the outskirts of a @xmath189 cluster to be very similar to the central regions .",
    "regardless of their proximity to the two main cores of rx  j0152 - 13 , the groups in the redshift interval @xmath40 , contain an enhanced fraction of red galaxies .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the f4 and f6 groups imply virial radii , @xmath124 ( i.e. unprojected ) , of @xmath190  mpc and @xmath191  mpc respectively .",
    "the median local density of galaxies in these groups is @xmath192  mpc@xmath122 .",
    "recall that these densities are computed for galaxies above a luminosity - limit ( @xmath193 ) . converting this surface density into a true space density with the virial radii computed above",
    ", we find @xmath194  mpc@xmath195 . given that the relative velocities of the galaxies in these groups are much closer to the galaxy interval velocities , and that the galaxies are in regions of high density ,",
    "the frequency of galaxy - galaxy interactions and merging is enhanced .",
    "the merger of disk galaxies can lead to the formation of ellipticals @xcite and processes associated with merger events , such as starbursts @xcite and agn feedback @xcite among others ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , can quench star formation and move galaxies towards the red - sequence .",
    "thus , mechanisms in these group environments exist to develop and enhance a high red galaxy fraction .      in intermediate density enhancements (",
    "@xmath171 : somewhat lower in density compared to the groups f4 and f6 discussed above ) at large clustercentric radii , @xmath12  mpc , the red galaxy fraction is also elevated relative to the value in the lowest density bin .",
    "these intermediate densities therefore represent a regime in which galaxies begin to transition towards the red - sequence in larger proportions than what is found at the lowest densities , where the local environment is not effective in influencing galaxy evolution .",
    "galaxies at these intermediate densities are not all obviously identified with large groups in the outskirts such as the f4 and f6 groups , though many are found near them .",
    "instead , they appear to trace the filamentary structure surrounding the cluster , and so may indicate the sites of the earliest stages of transformation to red , quiescent early - type galaxies .",
    "the local environment of a galaxy can be thought of as a tracer for the underlying mass of the dark matter halo in which it resides .",
    "@xcite explored abundance matching and found that a galaxy s _ halo mass _ determines the amount of _ stellar mass _ the galaxy will have at @xmath13 as well as its star formation rate .",
    "their work focuses primarily on the central galaxies in dark matter halos .",
    "the satellite galaxies that occupy subhalos , which are part of more massive group and cluster sized halos , are not specifically addressed in their work .",
    "the ubiquitous red colors of the highest mass galaxies in our sample could reflect the lack of star formation in high mass galaxies found at @xmath13 in this model .",
    "galaxies of lower mass in the model are expected to have higher star formation rates at this epoch .",
    "the low mass galaxies in our sample that reside outside of the two cluster cores and infalling groups support this view given their blue colors .",
    "however , it is plausible , even likely , that these lower mass galaxies will eventually fall into larger mass halos , where a number of mechanisms are capable of changing their structure and halting star formation , some of which were discussed above .",
    "we studied the environmental dependence of galaxy colors in the @xmath0 galaxy cluster rx  j0152 - 13  in order to investigate where galaxies transition from blue , late - type systems into red , early - type ones that dominate the central regions .",

    "the redshifts derived from the ldp show a scatter of @xmath64 , or 1% in @xmath198 , about those derived from higher resolution spectra (   [ redshifts ] ) , allowing us to localize galaxies within the superstructure of the cluster .",
    "stellar masses for galaxies were computed using the @xcite relation between rest - frame @xmath92 color and @xmath199 (   [ masses ] ) .",
    "we used a mass - limited sample of 300  galaxies with mass @xmath6  @xmath7  ( @xmath810.6 )  to conduct our study .",
    "this mass threshold corresponds to the @xmath4-band magnitude along the red - sequence at which the spectroscopic completeness is @xmath47 ( @xmath4  @xmath200 ) .",
    "because the spectroscopic completeness varies for galaxies of different mass , we applied completeness corrections when necessary (   [ completeness ] ) .",
    "we assigned galaxies to be blue or red based on their deviation from the red - sequence , with blue galaxies having @xmath85  colors @xmath106  mag or more below the red - sequence .",
    "this initial sample provides an opportunity to analyze cluster galaxy properties at intermediate redshift with substantial statistical significance , and is only a glimpse of what will be possible when our survey is complete and we are likely to have over @xmath41  members .",
    "our conclusions are the following :    1 .   the most massive galaxies ( @xmath811.3 ) lie on the red - sequence at all clustercentric radii and all local densities , while less massive galaxies have a broad range in colors farther from the two cluster cores and in lower density environments . in this massive cluster at @xmath17",
    "most of the evolution due to environmental effects is occurring in the lower mass galaxies . 2 .",
    "the fraction of galaxies that are on the red - sequence is at a maximum in the two cores of the cluster at @xmath9 .",

    "3 .   at @xmath12",
    "mpc , where the correlation between clustercentric radius and density is nonexistent , we find that the red galaxy fraction increases with local density .",
    "this implies that the local environment is a factor in galaxy evolution in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "4 .   the high density environments ( @xmath170 ) in the outskirts ( @xmath12  mpc ) have a red galaxy fraction that is similar to what is found in the two cores .",

    "the uniformity of the colors of the highest mass galaxies at @xmath17 suggests that the vast majority of their star formation has taken place already , even at this epoch , while the diverse colors of the somewhat lower mass sample indicate that the transformation process is still underway in the intermediate density regions in the outer parts of rx  j0152 - 13 .",

    "the width of the cluster redshift window , @xmath40 , was chosen to accommodate redshift uncertainties for galaxies determined to be members from imacs spectroscopy .",
    "this window is large enough to allow field interlopers to fall into our sample .",
    "these galaxies have redshifts within the cluster redshift window but are far from the cluster superstructure .",
    "their deviation in redshift from the cluster s reflects expansion with the hubble flow rather than an induced peculiar velocity from the nearby massive structure .    to correct the red galaxy fractions for contamination from field interlopers we employ a statistical background subtraction . for a given surface area of size @xmath208 ,",
    "the number of galaxies with density @xmath108 falling into this patch of sky is given by @xmath209 and the number of field interlopers is given by @xmath210 .",
    "the contamination fraction at a particular density @xmath108 is therefore @xmath211 .",
    "we use the median density in a particular density bin to represent @xmath108 when computing @xmath212 . the corrected red galaxy fraction , @xmath213 , and its uncertainty , @xmath214 ,",
    "can then be written in terms of the observed red fraction at a particular density , @xmath215 , the red fraction for field interlopers , @xmath216 , and their respective uncertainties as follows :      we define a field interloper sample using those galaxies with @xmath6  @xmath7  ( @xmath810.6 )  at clustercentric radii @xmath12  mpc and densities of @xmath147 .",
    "this sample represents galaxies in the lowest density bin in figure  [ colorfracdensity45]@xmath146 where the red fraction is @xmath218 and the uncertainty is @xmath219 .",
    "the median density for this sample is @xmath220  mpc@xmath122 . at @xmath12  mpc ,",
    "the observed red fraction in figure  [ redseqfrac ] is roughly constant , implying that a field population has been reached at these clustercentric radii .",
    "we further select galaxies in the lowest density bin to represent field interlopers because we are interested in determining the level of contamination in intermediate and high density clumps at @xmath12  mpc .",
    "in some cases , the corrected value for the red fraction exceeds unity , especially when the _ observed _ red fraction is already close to it .",
    "this effectively results from over - subtraction of blue galaxies when the observed number of blue galaxies is small . under these circumstances ,",
    "we assign the corrected red fraction to be @xmath221 .                  ,",

    "<S> our wide - field multi - slit survey with a low - dispersion prism ( ldp ) in the imacs spectrograph at the 6.5  m baade telescope allowed us to identify 475  new members of the cluster and its surrounding large - scale structure with a redshift accuracy of @xmath2 and a contamination rate of @xmath3 for galaxies with @xmath4  @xmath5  mag . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these new members with the 279  previously known spectroscopic members to give a total of 754  galaxies from which we obtain a mass - limited sample of 300  galaxies with stellar masses @xmath6  @xmath7  ( @xmath810.6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the red galaxy fraction is @xmath9 in the two merging cores of the cluster and declines to a level of @xmath10 at projected clustercentric radii @xmath11  mpc . at these large projected distances , </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between clustercentric radius and local density is nonexistent . </S>",
    "<S> this allows an assessment of the influence of the local environment on galaxy evolution , as opposed to mechanisms that operate on cluster scales ( e.g. harassment , ram - pressure stripping ) . even beyond @xmath12  </S>",
    "<S> mpc we find an increasing fraction of red galaxies with increasing local density . </S>",
    "<S> the red galaxy fraction at the highest local densities in two large groups at @xmath12  mpc matches the red galaxy fraction found in the two cores . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , galaxies at intermediate densities at @xmath12  mpc , that are not obvious members of groups , also show signs of an enhanced red galaxy fraction . </S>",
    "<S> our results point to such intermediate density regions and the groups in the outskirts of the cluster , as sites where the local environment influences the transition of galaxies onto the red - sequence . </S>"
