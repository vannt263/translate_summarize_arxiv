    "considering the same update sequence constructed for theorem [ thisisthetheorem ] , with the difference that the starting goe configuration has all vertex @xmath15 states except for the one in the @xmath170 position , we obtain the maximum path lenght in a connected component .",

    "analogously , goe configurations will be those system state containing one single vertex @xmath15 state or more vertex @xmath15 states separated by at least one @xmath98 state .",
    "the phase space of a binary @xmath15-threshold sds over a line graph is constituted by a the isolated fixed point @xmath81 and a tree - like connected component rooted at the fixed point @xmath82 .",
    "we can therefore apply the same arguments we have used for @xmath20-gons to find an update sequence that gives the longest goe - to - root path in the connected component containing @xmath82 .",
    "starting at the goe state @xmath174 we use the identity update sequence .",
    "it will take exactly @xmath175 updates to reach the @xmath82 .",
    "this is the maximum number of applications of the sds - map , since to produce at least @xmath20 steps one should have an update order that does leave the entire system state unchanged under at least one update .",

    "there exists at least one update sequence that maximizes the goe - to - root path length in the phase space of a binary @xmath15-threshold sds .",
    "the maximum length attainable is @xmath175 .",
    "besides being important to numerous applications , line graphs constitute an example of how our results can be combined to work out the phase space component structure of new sds from old ones .",
    "theorem [ thm:2_threshold_phase_space_star_n ] and theorem [ thm : threshold_phase_space_of_circ_n ] allow us to derive the following result .",

    "we have internal vertices , that is , all the vertices @xmath5 with @xmath177 and the two leaves at the ends of the line with degree @xmath15 .    for the internal vertices we have the same neighborhood structure that we have seen in the proof of theorem [ thm : threshold_phase_space_of_circ_n ] .",
    "thus , the result for @xmath10-threshold sds over @xmath77 apply for internal vertices .",
    "the update of the leaves depends only on the state of the internal vertex to which they are adjacent , in other words it behaves exactly as the update of an arm vertex in a star .",
    "thus , theorem [ thm:2_threshold_phase_space_star_n ] ensures that the vertex states of the extremities are fixed after exactly one system update .",
    "so for any vertex @xmath178 , @xmath179 $ ] reaches a `` local fixed point '' after at most one application of @xmath180 .",
    "we conclude that for any system state @xmath181 holds .    again , fixed points of line graphs can be determined through a generalization of the local fixed point method in @xcite .",
    "the basins of attraction can be determined accordingly .    for a threshold value @xmath182",
    ", we see immediately that the only fixed point is @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , all the systems states containing vertex @xmath15 states will eventually be updated to @xmath81 since there is always at least one neighborhood @xmath179 $ ] for which @xmath183 < 3 $ ] .",
    "the goe configurations for @xmath134-threshold sds over line graph will then have the same characteristics as those for @xmath134-threshold sds over @xmath20-gons .    to set up the update sequence that gives the longest possible goe - to - root path length , we choose the state @xmath82 as starting point . since for any update sequence the end vertex states will necessarily be update to @xmath98 , we proceed from the ends towards the center vertices in the same fashion as we did for @xmath20-gons .",
    "we thus consider    @xmath184    with this update sequence it takes @xmath82 exactly @xmath185 applications of the sds - map to be updated to @xmath81 . since for any two vertex @xmath98 states that are separated by a string of @xmath15 states on a line graph each system update must produce at least two new vertex @xmath98 states .",
