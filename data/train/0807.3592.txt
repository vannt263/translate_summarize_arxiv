    "the renewed interest in graphene@xcite and the close analogy of its band structure to the spectrum of the zero mass dirac equation suggests that a re - examination of several aspects of the one dimensional dirac equation should be carried out .",
    "the first of these aspects is the well known klein paradox@xcite which continues to persist in the literature .",
    "the second of these aspects is the question of how closely the graphene spectrum resembles the dirac spectral properties and states .",
    "dragoman in an excellent paper@xcite has recently examined some of these issues and has noted that there is no klein paradox .  in this paper",
    "we will examine the mathematics of solutions to the one dimensional dirac equation in the presence of a piece - wise constant potential step ( the klein problem ) .",
    "the solutions of this differential equation are exact and can be carried out analytically .",
    "the usual method of analysis will involve the delta function normalization of wave functions in the continous spectrum .  in order to clarify some of the mathematical details a slightly more meticulous method of calculation originally suggested by von neumann@xcite",
    "will be followed so that all of the mathematical inferences can be carried out transparently .  in the first section details of the solutions of the differential equation",
    "will be discussed .  at the end of that section",
    "the wave function solutions for the potential step will be exhibited .",
    "this will show that the klein paradox arises because of a mis - application of the solutions of piece - wise constant potentials for these one dimensiional dirac equations",
    ".  in the next section will be a short discussion of the admixture of free negative energy states into the positive energy states for this step potential system if the potential were to be turned on instantaneously .",
    "this admixture should monitor the creation of electron - positron pairs near the potential step .",
    "after this admixture discussion a characteristic of orthogonality in the thermodynamic limit will be discussed .",
    "the reflection coefficient for finite width square potential barriers will be displayed and finally the effect of piece - wise constant potential steps on zero mass states will be discussed as well as a comparison with both the energy spectrum and current densities for  a `` one dimensional '' graphene .",
    "one dimensional solutions of the schrodinger and dirac equations essentially reduce to finding the finite , continous , and differentiable solutions of a sturm - liouville type of differential equation on the whole line interval @xmath0@xcite,@xcite@xmath1  for the discrete spectrum of such equations there is an orthonormal set of eigenstates .  for the continuous spectrum",
    "the momemtum eigenstates are functions that can only be normalized with dirac delta functions .",
    "the delta function normalization is generally quite satisfactory except for some calculations involving squares of delta functions .     because of a desire to be mathematically careful and transparent in this examination of the klein paradox",
    ", a procedure will here be followed that dates back to von neumann@xcite and many others@xcite .",
    "specifically , all of the wave functions to be used here will be `` box normalized '' in regions of length @xmath2 and final results will be obtained in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath3 .  within the interval of length @xmath2",
    "the allowed momentum values will be discrete @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an integer",
    ".  this whole process will not be essential for the demonstration that the klein paradox is not a paradox at all , but will be useful in studying the admixture of free particle states and those interacting states in the presence of the potential step .  for each finite @xmath2 we will find that the eigenvalue spectrum will be discrete and that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 the spectrum becomes continuous and the eigenstates become delta function normalized .",
    "details of the transition to the thermodynamic limit have been discussed in detail by messiah@xcite , arfken and weber@xcite , and sneddon@xcite and some of these details will be discussed in the following .    the dirac equation with a constant potential has exact solutions which are the same as the free particle solutions except that the energy @xmath7 can be different from the free particle case@xmath8 by the addition of the constant potential .",
    "in order to simplify the notation in this study the velocity of light @xmath9 will be used in the formulas to follow .",
    "the dirac equation will be studied with 2x1 spinors for simplicity .",
    "this is a standard simplification sometimes described as `` no spin '' or `` single spin '' .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is that we consider these solutions to dirac equations in two regions @xmath10 and @xmath11 and construct all wave functions out of two parts@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the heaviside function ( unit step function at zero ) , @xmath14 is a solution in the left side interval @xmath10 and @xmath15 is a solution in the right interval @xmath16  the boundary condition is that the two solutions be continuous at the origin@xmath17    in each region , @xmath10 and @xmath18the orthonormal positive and negative energy states , respectively , are given by@xmath19{c}%",

    "the energies of these states will depend on the side of the origin .  on the left the energy will be @xmath25 and on the right @xmath26  in the following paragraphs the wave vectors on the right side @xmath27 will be indicated with a prime as @xmath28     on either side of the origin these solutions are orthonormal@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the kronecker delta , @xmath31 if @xmath32 and zero if @xmath33  in each interval the allowed momentum values are @xmath4 where @xmath5 is any integer .",
    "similarly , @xmath34  the discrete @xmath24 values are those which guarantee that the momentum operator is hermitian , namely , that @xmath35 for the right side , and similarly on the left side .",
    "the usual delta function nromalization is achieved by removing the normalization factor @xmath36 from each wave function and recalling that for all sequences leading to the thermodynamic limit@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dirac delta function@xmath1  in the following it will often be the case that the normalizations for each half interval @xmath39 will be discarded and normalization on the whole interval @xmath40 will be re - calculated .    for the dirac equation on the whole interval @xmath0",
    "there are no states in the mass gap @xmath41  but , for each of the two half intervals there are evanescent ( exponential ) wave functions that preserve momentum hermiticity .",
    "these are labeled by a complex momentum @xmath42 and have both positive and negative energy relative to the center of the mass gap @xmath43 and can be written  for each fixed @xmath2 in the sequence as @xmath44{c}% 1\\\\ iw_{\\kappa}% \\end{array } \\right )   e^{-\\kappa z}+e^{-\\kappa l}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% 1\\\\ -iw_{\\kappa}% \\end{array } \\right )   e^{\\kappa z}%\\]]@xmath45{c}% -iw_{\\kappa}\\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right )   e^{-\\kappa z}+e^{-\\kappa l}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% iw_{\\kappa}\\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right )   e^{\\kappa z}%\\ ] ] where @xmath46 for the interval @xmath16 similar functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined for the interval @xmath49  in the thermodynamic limit the second term vanishes and these functions yield the usual single exponential function .    when the step potential @xmath50 is zero , there are no allowed states in the mass gap . even when @xmath51 there are no states in the part of the gap which remains on both sides of the origin .",
    "the general solution is now achieved by equating at the origin the two functions , one from from each side at the origin , that have the same energy , and using this equality of energy to determine the relationship between the momenta on the two sides .  in tables",
    "( 1 and 2 ) are shown the energy ranges and the structure of the wave functions in each region which have the same energy .",
    "note that for simplicity , we are examining states that initiate with a current from the left and contain a reflected wave on the left and transmitted wave on the right .",
    "there are two distinct @xmath50 energy ranges and to simplify the discussion table 1 shows the wave function pairings and the relationships between the left and right side momenta for small @xmath51 and table 2 shows the same for @xmath52  the table shows the wave functions and the relationship between the momenta on each side of the origin and for each energy range .",
    "referring to table i , for small @xmath50 @xmath53 we will discuss the states from the top of the table ( highest energy ) to the bottom ( lowest energy ) .  at the top are the states for which @xmath54  as can be seen in the table we have `` positive energy '' functions @xmath55 @xmath56 on the left ( @xmath57 is the reflection amplitude ) and on the right we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the transmission amplitude .",
    "the next set of functions are in the energy interval @xmath60 , which are of the form @xmath61 in the left side and are matched with an evanescent wave @xmath62 on the right side .",
    "because the evanescent states carry no current , the reflection amplitude has unit magnitude and thus gives complete reflection .",
    "the next energy range @xmath63 corresponds to the empty mass gap with no wave functions satisfying the boundary condition .",
    "the next lower energy range @xmath64 corresponds to another combination of which half is evanescent and can not carry any current .",
    "these states have an evanescent wave @xmath65on the left and @xmath66 on the right .",
    "the reflection amplitude again has magnitude 1 as found before for a combination of traveling and evanescent waves .",
    "the lowest energy states are the fully negative energy states and have @xmath67 @xmath68 on the left and @xmath69 on the right .",
    "as the potential step size @xmath50 increases and enters into the range @xmath70 a new pairing of functions that klein did not consider begins to appear .",
    "these states are discussed table 2 .",
    "examining the top of table 2 , the highest energy range @xmath71 is unchanged from the previous discussion .",
    "the second energy range is now expanded to @xmath72 and remains , as before , with complete reflection .",
    "the new range @xmath73 pairs wave functions @xmath74 @xmath56 on the left with transmitted functions @xmath75 on the right@xmath1  the remaining lower energy ranges and functions are not changed significantly from the previous discussion .",
    "this new set of solutions on both sides in the energy range @xmath76 is what klein did not consider .  in the following",
    "we will solve for the reflection and transmission amplitudes for those cases with non - zero probability current density .    for energies above the step ,",
    "@xmath77 it is straightforward to show that@xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 and@xmath81 using the usual definitions of current density , it is easy to determine that the reflection coefficient @xmath82 and the transmission coefficient @xmath83 are given by@xmath84 and@xmath85 from which it is easy to see that @xmath86    for the ranges of energies in which the waves on the right ( or the left ) are evanescent , we easily find that @xmath87 and @xmath88    for the case which klein did not consider , when @xmath89 similar calculations yield@xmath90@xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 is defined as before .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients are:@xmath94 and@xmath95 from which it is also easy to see that @xmath86    from these calculations it is clear that there is no paradox .",
    "klein simply did not match the appropriate solutions in the two regions .",
    "this mis - match is what is responsible for the usual assumption of a failure of particle conservation ( usually taken to imply the production of particle hole pairs near the potential step ) that has been so often interpreted as the meaning of the klein paradox .",
    "these analytic solutions show that particle number is always conserved independent of the size of the step potential .",
    "the surprising phenomena is that the barrier is close to being transparent in a certain energy range if the step height @xmath50 is large enough .",
    "this behavior of the reflection coefficient is shown in fig . 1 where the reflection coefficient @xmath82 has been simultaneously plotted for three different values of @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98  in all of these cases there is a region of complete reflection with an energy width of @xmath99 and centered on the value of @xmath100  at higher energies the reflection coefficient decreases with increasing energy .",
    "the surprising result is that the reflection coefficient decreases in the energy interval @xmath101 and the barrier becomes partially transparent in this energy range .",
    "this result is an exact consequence of the matching of exact solutions in the two regions joined by the boundary condition .  on physical grounds",
    "this result would seem to be unexpected , but the potential step has pulled what used to be negative energy states into a positive energy range and their ability to carry current leads to the partial transparency of the potential step in this energy range .  one possible origin for this surprising phenomena could be with dirac s original choice for adding potential energies onto the free particle dirac hamiltonian .",
    "another aspect of the behavior of this system can be probed by studying the overlap of these interacting states in the presence of the potential step with the free states of the free particle hamiltonian .",
    "this is equivalent to asking how the wave functions are matched in the sudden approximation if the step potential were instantaneously turned on .",
    "if there were a production of extra electron positron pairs by the potential step , it could be expected that this overlap would be an indicator of such when the potential @xmath50 becomes larger than @xmath102  in order to carry out this estimate we would need to calculatelatexmath:[\\[n=\\sum_{k^{\\prime\\prime},p_{k}}|\\langle n_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}|p_{k}\\rangle    energy wave function of the zero potential hamiltonian spanning both intervals @xmath10 and @xmath18 and @xmath104 represents any positive energy state of the hamiltonian with the potential step @xmath100  and the expression is summed over all positive energy states with non - zero matrix elements .",
    "it is first important to notice that all of the positive energy states of on both sides of the potential step , which are above the mass gaps on each side , will have no contribution to this matrix element because all of these states are made up of linear combinations of @xmath105 and @xmath56 which are orthogonal to @xmath106 in both of the intervals @xmath10 and @xmath16  so , the only states that can overlap with the negative energy states can be :    \\(1 ) evanescent states in the mass gaps ( which will be shown to be negligable in the thermodynamic limit , see appendix i ) ,    \\(2 ) the negative energy states @xmath66 in the range @xmath107 which are matched with evanescent states .",
    "the wave functions for these are of the form@xmath108 and    \\(3 ) positive energy states appearing when @xmath89 which carry current on both sides@xmath109    before evaluating these three cases , it is possible to arrive at an intuitive estimate of this quantity by simply asking from a density of states perspective how many of these originally negative energy states have been pulled up from energy @xmath110 to positive energies @xmath111 by the magnitude of @xmath100  if we ignore the boundary conditions , the number of such states would be given by the integral@xmath112    let us first examine case ( 2 ) .",
    "the first step is to evaluate the normalization @xmath113 which yields@xmath114 neglecting terms of order @xmath115 and smaller and using the orthogonality of @xmath116 and @xmath106 it is straightforward to show that@xmath117 now , for each @xmath2 in the sequence to the thermodynamic limit , it is true that@xmath118 so we obtain@xmath119 this implies that@xmath120 for the energy range @xmath121  if @xmath122 the lower limit of the @xmath123 integration becomes @xmath124 so that the expression for @xmath125 in that case becomes@xmath126    now let us examine case ( 3 ) .  in this case",
    "the matrix element becomes@xmath127 where@xmath128 substituting for @xmath129 and @xmath59 from the eqn .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) above , we find@xmath130 so , the contribution from this case is@xmath131    the remaining case 1 is analyzed in appendix i and gives a result which is not extensive with the length @xmath2 and so makes no contribution in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the details and certain aspects of orthogonality in the thermodynamic limit are presented in appendix i.    the dependence of @xmath132 on the barrier height @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "2 .  for small @xmath50",
    "the intuitive estimate and the exact result agree .  when the potential height becomes greater then @xmath133 the lower limit of eqn .",

    "the smooth curve is the intuitive estimate given by eqn .",
    "( 32 ) and the lower curve with the kink at @xmath135 is the exact result for this quantity .",
    "note that the behavior of this quantity is smooth after the threshold @xmath135 and less than the intuitive estimate .",
    "walker and gathright@xcite worked out all possible one dimensional transfer matrices for the non - relativistic schrodinger equation across potential discontinuities .",
    "they constructed transfer matrices for any arrangement of potential discontinuities by building the transfer matrices out of products of two different matrices :  the discontinuity matrix @xmath136 and the propagation matrix @xmath137  all such possible matrices have been worked out for the dirac equation and will be presented elsewhere .",

    "3 .  notice the ramsauer minima ( peaks in @xmath83 ) in the reflection coefficient.@xcite  notice also that the reflection coefficient for this symmetric case behaves much like the step potential if the potential energy @xmath50 is larger than the mass gap width and becomes semi - transparent at lower energies .",
    "the well known analogy between the band structure of graphene and the energy spectrum of the massless dirac equation has received much attention recently .  for the non - relativistic band structure calculations the velocity of a band state represented by the energy @xmath149 is linear in @xmath150 and",
    "is given by @xmath151 ( in one dimension ) .",
    "for electronic band structures the current density is proportional to the group velocity which is given by the derivative of the band energies,@xmath152 and the : `` graphene '' band structure spectrum will contain both positive and negative velocities for both positive and negative energies ( relative to the center of the band ) .",
    "examining the zero mass eigenstates of the dirac equation shows that there are some quite different behaviors than those observed in the non - relativistic band structure for graphene .",

    "this condition and the fact that current direction is so strongly associated with the sign of the energy ( relative to @xmath50 ) indicates that the analogy between the graphene bandstructure and the massless dirac equation is not completely accurate .",
    "the klein paradox is not a paradox .  it is simply a mis - application of the processes by which",
    "the solution of piece - wise constant potential differential equations are constructed .",
    "when the appropriate wave functions at the same energies are connected , the reflection and transmission coefficients are continuous functions of the incident wave vector and always obey the conservation of particle number .",
    "the surprising characteristic of these solutions is the near transparency of the step potential at low energies if @xmath52  this property of the solutions arises from the fact that for large @xmath50 states which were originally at negative energies are now pulled up into positive energies and it becomes possible for a current to be carried through the step .",
    "this result is clearly a property of the solutions of this dirac equation .",
    "the more difficult question is whether this behavior is physically to be expected .",
    "this property reflects a choice made by dirac when he decided to add a potential energy to his free particle equation .",
