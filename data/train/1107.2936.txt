    "the ohm s law is anisotropic , giving rise to ohmic resistivity , hall effect , and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) as the three non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) effects . more formally , assuming the inertia in the ionized species is negligible , the dynamical equations for the neutrals are the same as ideal mhd except for the induction equation , which reads @xmath18\\ , \\label{eq : induction}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the velocity of the neutrals",

    "when ions and electrons are the only charged species in the gas ( which can be relaxed to when the electrons are the main negative charge carriers ) , a simple expression for the diffusion coefficients reads @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the resistivity due to the electrons , @xmath1 is the electron number density , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass density of the neutrals and the ions , @xmath30 is defined after equation ( [ eq : betaj ] ) . in general ,",
    "ohmic effect dominates in dense regions with weak magnetic field , ad dominates in tenuous regions with strong magnetic field , while the hall regime lies in between .",
    "grains , which typically contribute to about @xmath31 of mass in the gas , can possess both positive and negative charges .",
    "grains are well known for significantly enhancing the electron recombination rate @xcite , which reduces the ionization fraction ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number density of hydrogen atom ) , and leads to greatly increased ohmic resistivity . however , in sufficiently weakly ionized gas , the abundance of tiny grains ( e.g. , the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon , pah ) may well exceed the electron abundance without contributing much to the mass budget . in this paper , we generalize equation ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) to include positive and negatively charged tiny grains and show that for sufficiently weak ionization , tiny grains can dramatically reduce @xmath34 and @xmath24 as the main charge carrier switches to the grains instead of ions and electrons .",
    "our result is directly applicable to protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) , where the ionization fraction resulting from major ionization sources such as x - rays and cosmic rays is generally orders of magnitude below unity , and it decreases from surface to the midplane because of the attenuation of ionizing particles @xcite .",
    "non - ideal mhd effects are closely relevant to the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) , whose linear dispersion relation as well as the non - linear saturation properties are strongly affected @xcite , and whether the mri is responsible for driving rapid accretion with @xmath35 yr@xmath15 in ppds @xcite has been a long - standing problem .",
    "most studies have focused on the role of the ohmic resistivity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while it was not until recently have ad been taken into account to estimate the effectiveness of the mri @xcite . combining the most recent results from numerical simulations of the mri with ad @xcite , @xcite showed that while the mri can always operate in ppds , ad can be a main limiting factor for the mri - driven accretion ( besides ohmic resistivity ) .",
    "the reduction of ad coefficient by tiny grains ( e.g. , pahs ) , while counterintuitive , helps enhance the accretion rate , as we will demonstrate in this paper .",
    "although observational data show strong evidence of grain growth to micron size or larger in ppds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , pah emission has also been detected in majority of herbig ae / be stars @xcite , as well as a small fraction of t - tauri stars @xcite . as argued in @xcite , pahs may be equally abundant in t - tauri disks but they fluoresce less luminously due to fainter ultraviolet radiation field of their host stars .",
    "the existence of pahs also suggests a continuous size distribution of grains to the smallest end of a few @xmath36 as a result of grain coagulation and fragmentation . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the phrases  tiny grain \" and pah interchangeably , which refer to grain with size @xmath37 m .",
    "tiny grains may dominate larger grains in abundance while contribute a negligible fraction of the total grain mass .",
    "taking the grain density to be 3 g @xmath38 and the gas mean molecular weight @xmath39 to be @xmath40 atomic mass ( as appropriate for ppds ) , the relation between grain mass fraction ( @xmath41 ) and grain abundance per h@xmath7 molecule ( @xmath42 ) reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is grain size .",
    "the abundance of grains with @xmath37 m may easily reach large abundance of @xmath45 or higher , while the abundance of @xmath46 m grains would be at most about @xmath47 .",
    "the significance of this abundance cut ( @xmath48 ) will be addressed in this paper .    in section [ sec :",
    "grain ] we describe a generalized model for non - ideal mhd diffusion coefficients with the inclusion of charged grains .",
    "the model is applied to interpret the the results in section [ sec : ppd ] , where we study the role of tiny grains in ppds following the methodology of @xcite .",
    "summary and discussion follow in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the ohm s law derives from the motion of charged particles , which is characterized by the hall parameter , the ratio between the gyrofrequency and the momentum exchange rate @xcite . for species @xmath49 with mass @xmath50 and charge @xmath51",
    ", the hall parameter reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the rate coefficient for momentum transfer between charged species @xmath49 with the neutrals and @xmath39 is the mean molecular weight of the neutrals .",
    "charged species @xmath49 is strongly coupled to the neutrals if @xmath55 , and is strongly tied to magnetic fields when @xmath56 .    in weakly ionized gas with a number of different charged species , the general expressions for the ohmic , hall and ambipolar diffusion coefficients are given by @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and the ohmic , hall and pedersen conductivities are @xmath59 respectively , where the summation goes over all charged species .",
    "note that the hall conductivity depends on the sign of @xmath60 , while @xmath61 and @xmath62 depend only on @xmath63 .",
    "the simple expressions for the magnetic diffusion coefficients ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) can be obtained by assuming electrons and ions are the only two charged species .",
    "below we generalize it to include tiny grains .",
    "besides the reason mentioned in the introduction , we consider tiny grains because they are unlikely to possess multiple charges due to higher potential barrier @xcite , which simplifies the algebra considerably .",
    "in addition , the mean free path for tiny grains is sufficiently small so that they can be treated as fluid .",
    "the momentum transfer rate coefficients for electrons , ions and grains can be found in equations ( 14 ) - ( 16 ) of @xcite .",
    "converting to the hall parameter , we have @xmath64 \\gg\\beta_i\\ , \\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] for ions and electrons respectively , where @xmath65 is the magnetic field strength measured in gauss , @xmath66 @xmath38 , and the @xmath39 is taken to be @xmath40 atomic mass appropriate for ppds . for singly charged small grains ,",
    "the resulting @xmath67 is very close to @xmath68 , because the reduced gyro - frequency due to larger mass is compensated by the reduced momentum transfer rate due to larger inertia .",
    "the electron hall parameter @xmath69 is much larger than @xmath68 because electrons are the most mobile species .",
    "therefore , in terms of conductivity , we only have two groups of charges : electrons with hall parameter @xmath69 , and ions / charged grains with hall parameter @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath70 be the total number density of the second group . since grains can carry negative charge",
    ", one has @xmath71 .",
    "generalization from @xmath72 ( grain - free case , which leads to equation ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) ) to @xmath73 involves more complicated algebra , as we describe below . for brevity",
    ", we ignore the pre - factor @xmath74 in conductivities and @xmath75 in diffusivities , which make them dimensionless .",

    "the perpendicular conductivity is @xmath80 where @xmath81}\\ .\\ ] ] note that @xmath82 in the grain - free case ( @xmath79 ) .",

    "we see that the grains affect the magnetic diffusion coefficients mainly via two factors : @xmath88 and @xmath89 , both of which are independent of magnetic field strength .",
    "the former describes the ratio of total conductivity to electron conductivity , while the latter describes the number density ratio of ions / grains to electrons , and is much more substantial than the factor ( 1+@xmath78 ) since @xmath86 .    for @xmath90",
    ", we generally have @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and the classical results ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) are recovered .",
    "in particular , ohmic resistivity dominates when @xmath93 , where both ions and electrons are coupled to the neutrals ; hall regime corresponds to @xmath94 , where electrons are coupled to the magnetic field while the ions are not ; ad regime corresponds to @xmath95 where both electrons and ions are coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "this is the classical interpretation of the non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "qualitatively new behaviors appear when @xmath96 , where grains play a dominant role in the abundance of charged particles ( @xmath97 ) . in the next two paragraphs",
    ", we discuss the asymptotic behaviors of the diffusion coefficients , where comparison is made with the grain - free diffusion coefficients ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) at fixed @xmath1 . in reality , tiny grains strongly reduces @xmath1 relative to the grain - free case , which will be discussed at the end of this section .",
    "the ohmic resistivity is least affected by grains , which is simply reduced by a factor of @xmath88 relative to the electron resistivity regardless of magnetic field strength . therefore , grain conductivity becomes important when @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "for hall and ad coefficients , we consider two separate limits .",
    "when @xmath100 ( ohmic regime ) , we have @xmath101 where we have factored out the results into the grain - free expression ( left ) multiplied by a correction factor ( right ) .",
    "we see that the hall diffusivity is only moderately affected by grains , being reduced by a factor of @xmath102 at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the ad , on the other hand , is enhanced by a factor of @xmath3 , in addition to a moderate reduction by @xmath103 .",
    "nevertheless , changes in hall and ad coefficients do not play a significant role here since ohmic resistivity is still the dominant effect .    in the opposite limit @xmath104 ( ad regime ) , we have @xmath105 we see that in this limit and at fixed @xmath1 , the hall effect is reduced by a factor of @xmath5 , while ad is reduced by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "the reduction of ad is easily understood . without grains ,",
    "the neutral gas is coupled to the magnetic field through ion - neutral collisions , hence @xmath107 .",
    "electrons play a negligible role because of its small inertia . charged grains ( no matter positive or negative ) play exactly the same role as ions , hence we have @xmath108 in the presence of grains .",
    "we also note that the hall effect vanishes if positive and negative charge carriers have the same mass , which is consistent with our result as @xmath109 .    .",
    "we have considered two different values of the charged grain abundance parameter : @xmath110 ( @xmath111 , dashed ) and @xmath112 ( @xmath113 , solid).,width=340 ]    in figure [ fig : model ] we show two sample calculations of the magnetic diffusion coefficients for @xmath110 ( dashed ) and @xmath112 ( solid ) respectively , which corresponds to situations where charged grain abundance is comparable to , and greatly exceed the electron abundance .",
    "the two asymptotic regimes derived above are clearly seen , with a transition region in between .",
    "the @xmath110 results are close to the grain - free case , where all three curves are close to straight lines except weak transitions as @xmath68 passes @xmath114 .",
    "for relatively large @xmath78 , the transition region extends from @xmath115 to @xmath116 . because of the suppression of the hall diffusion beyond @xmath115 and enhancement of ad before @xmath115 , ad becomes the dominant effect even when @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , and the hall regime gradually diminishes as @xmath78 increases .",
    "these results nicely explain the observed magnetic diffusivity pattern in figure 2 of @xcite , as aided with the chemical abundances shown in figure 1 of the same paper .",
    "now let us take into account the chemistry in the gas .",
    "assuming fixed gas density , temperature , and ionization rate , the equilibrium electron number density in the presence of small grains @xmath119 is much smaller than that in the grain - free case @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "therefore , hall and ad coefficients are made larger by a factor of @xmath121 .",
    "however , this factor is compensated by another reduction factor of @xmath122 for the hall effect and of @xmath123 for ad in the ad dominated regime . here",
    "we focus on ad . in order to have a net reduction of ad coefficient",
    "when @xmath124 ( ad regime ) , it is required that @xmath125 that is , the charged grain abundance has to exceed the grain - free electron abundance .",
    "we will see that this condition can be met in ppds .",
    "similarly , for ohmic resistivity to be reduced relative to the grain - free case , one requires @xmath126 .",
    "this condition , however , is very unrealistic given the disk chemistry ( see section [ ssec : chem ] ) , thus ohmic resistivity always increases in the presence of tiny grains .",
    "nevertheless , if condition ( [ eq : criterion ] ) is met ( which is generally the case when pahs are sufficiently abundant , see section [ ssec : chem ] ) , ohmic resistivity is enhanced by at most a factor of about @xmath4 relative to the grain - free case .",
    "to illustrate the significance of the theoretical results in the previous section , we study the role of tiny grains in ppds . we refer to section 3 of @xcite for all details about the methodology and calculation procedures , which we follow exactly except that here we consider @xmath127 nm sized grains ( as a proxy for pahs ) instead of larger grains ev in the calculation of the electron - grain sticking coefficient rather than 1 ev used in @xcite . ] .",
    "the pah abundance in t - tauri stars estimated by @xcite is about @xmath128-@xmath129 per h@xmath7 molecule , while @xcite argued for smaller abundance due to dust settling .",
    "moreover , the distribution of pahs in ppds has been found to be spatially variable @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we adopt @xmath130 as fiducial , while we also consider @xmath131 down to @xmath132 and up to @xmath129 .",
    "we fix the x - ray luminosity to be @xmath133 erg s@xmath15 , x - ray temperature to be 5 kev , and include cosmic - ray ionization of @xmath134 s@xmath15 with penetration depth of @xmath135 g @xmath136 .",
    "we use the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn , @xcite ) as the fiducial disk model , while we also consider the much more massive disk model by @xcite .",
    "a complex chemical network of more than @xmath137 reactions are evolved at different heights and radii of the disk for 1 myr to ( quasi- ) chemical equilibrium , from which abundance of charged species are extracted to evaluate the non - ideal mhd diffusion coefficients .",

    "the ionization rate is plotted ( black dashed ) for reference.,width=340 ]      in figure [ fig : nsp ] we show the electron , ion and grain abundances at @xmath139 au in the mmsn model as a function of disk height ( @xmath140 ) , normalized to the disk scale height ( @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the sound speed , @xmath143 is the disk angular frequency ) .",
    "we see that electrons and ions are the dominant charged species ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) above @xmath145 , while below it the abundances of ions and charged grains exceed electron abundance , and @xmath3 reaches about @xmath146 at the disk midplane .",
    "the large value of @xmath3 implies strong suppresion of ad and the hall effect according to equation ( [ eq : eta_ad ] ) . to see its significance",
    ", we also show the electron ( thus ion ) abundance in the grain - free calculation as the red dash - dotted line in the figure .",
    "clearly , we see that @xmath147 for @xmath148 . according to equation ( [ eq : criterion ] ) ,",
    "this means that when tiny grains are present , the ad coefficient is even smaller than that in the grain - free case ! seemingly counterintuitive",
    ", one can qualitatively understand this result as follows .",
    "near the disk midplane , we see that @xmath149 . in this regime ,",
    "the electrons produced from h@xmath7 ionization is quickly swallowed by the grains .",
    "similarly , the ions exchange charge with neutral grains to produce positively charged grains .",
    "therefore , ionization effectively takes place on the grains : 2 gr @xmath150 gr@xmath151 + gr@xmath152 , with the same ionization rate @xmath153 .",
    "the dominant recombination channel is simply its inverse reaction , with recombination rate given by equation ( 3 ) of @xcite .",
    "for recombination between two equal sized tiny grains ( @xmath154 ) , it reduces to @xmath155 where @xmath156 g cm@xmath15 is the grain mass density , @xmath158 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath159 is the temperature . in the second equation @xmath160 denotes grain size normalized to 1 nm , and @xmath161 k. as long as charged grain recombination is the dominant recombination process , the abundance of charged grains can be approximately given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the ionization rate normalized to @xmath164 , @xmath165 is the number density of the hydrogen atoms normalized to @xmath166 . plugging in the numbers relevant to figure [ fig : nsp ] at midplane",
    ", we find @xmath167 .",
    "our chemistry calculation gives @xmath168 for the averaged abundance of charged grains , which is slightly smaller due to small contributions from other recombination channels , but is within a factor of 2 from the analytical estimate .",
    "our chemistry calculations further reveal that @xmath169 increases weakly with total grain abundance @xmath170 ( or @xmath131 ) and approaches the asymptotic value ( [ eq : ngrpm ] ) .    in the grain - free case ,",
    "the electron abundance @xmath120 is determined by the balance between ionization and multiple recombination channels , dominated by dissociative recombinations .",
    "typical electron - ion dissociative recombination rate coefficients are on the order of @xmath129 s@xmath15 @xmath38 at @xmath171k , which is a factor of several higher than the grain recombination coefficient ( [ eq : rcbrate ] ) .",
    "the higher recombination rate leads to smaller ionization level than our estimate ( [ eq : ngrpm ] ) , which explains why @xmath147 in the presence of abundant tiny grains .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath120 depends on the choice of chemical reaction network .",
    "simple reaction network ( such as @xcite ) generally produces larger @xmath120 mainly because of the lack of recombination channels . in our complex",
    "( and presumably more realistic ) network , we find that the dominant recombination process is due to nh@xmath172 and ch@xmath173cnh@xmath151 in this particular case , giving @xmath174 to be about @xmath175 . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath176 in the midplane , which leads to a substantial net reduction of the ad coefficient .      the fact that @xmath177 implies that tiny grains may facilitate the mri by suppressing ad . to see this more explicitly , we calculate the non - ideal mhd diffusion coefficients and apply the criteria ( 20 ) in @xcite to identify the mri - active regions in our adopted ppd model . briefly , for the mri to operate , the ohmic elsasser number @xmath178 has to be greater than unity , where @xmath179 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field has to be weaker than some critical value , which is set by @xmath180 . here",
    "plasma @xmath67 is the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure ( not to be confused with the hall parameter ) , @xmath181 is the ad elsasser number , and @xmath182 is given by @xcite @xmath183^{1/2}\\ , \\label{eq : betamin}\\ ] ] which increases with decreasing @xmath184 . for the number density profile given in figure [ fig : nsp ] ,",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : constrain ] .",
    "we see that the inclusion of tiny grains strongly increases the ohmic resistivity , as expected . at disk midplane ,",
    "magnetic field has to be about 10 times stronger than the grain - free case in order for @xmath185 to be above 1 ( i.e. , @xmath186 is about 100 times larger as read from figure [ fig : nsp ] , electrons and other charged species contribute roughly equally to the ohmic conductivity . ] ) .",
    "however , the ionization fraction at disk midplane is still large enough such that in both cases , the required field strength for @xmath187 is still far from equipartition ( i.e. , @xmath188 ) .",
    "this fact makes ohmic resistivity essentially irrelevant in determining the vertical extent of the active layer and the accretion rate ( since the midplane is already active ) , while the decisive role is played by ad .    in figure [ fig :",
    "constrain ] , contours of constant @xmath184 are straight lines in the grain free case , as @xmath184 is independent of the magnetic field . with the inclusion of tiny grains , we see that near the midplane region , @xmath184 increases by @xmath189 orders of magnitude as magnetic field increases .",
    "this corresponds to the transition region in figure [ fig : model ] with @xmath94 .",
    "eventually , at sufficiently strong magnetic field ( @xmath95 ) , @xmath184 becomes independent of magnetic field again .",
    "since @xmath177 , @xmath184 is larger in the presence of pahs than in the grain - free case . therefore , according to ( [ eq : betamin ] ) , stronger magnetic field is permitted near the disk midplane thanks to the pahs . according to the strong linear correlation between the shakura - sunyaev @xmath190 parameter and the magnetic field strength @xcite",
    ", an approximate magnetic field strength can be derived if mri operates in ppds @xcite @xmath191 which assumes the thickness of the active layer to be @xmath192 on each side , and the second equation assumes one solar mass protostar with mmsn temperature profile . here @xmath193 is accretion rate measured in @xmath14 yr@xmath15 , @xmath194 is disk radius measured in au .",
    "the required magnetic field strengths for typical observed accretion rates are also illustrated in the figure .",
    "since stronger field leads to faster accretion , it becomes clear that pahs are able to make ppds accrete more rapidly than in the grain - free case .",
    "we note that the above explanation for the enhancement of accretion by tiny grains no longer completely holds in the inner region of ppds ( @xmath195 au ) , where the disk surface density is far above the x - ray penetration depth and accretion is layered . in such situations , the lower boundary of the active layer",
    "is determined by both ohmic resistivity and ad for the two elsasser number criteria to be satisfied ( e.g. , see the left panel of figure [ fig : transition ] in the appendix ) .",
    "since ohmic resistivity is larger in the presence of grains ( see the end of section [ sec : grain ] ) , accretion is thus less efficient than the grain - free case . on the other hand ,",
    "when pahs are sufficiently abundant , the increase in ohmic resistivity is bounded ( @xmath196 ) since conductivity is dominated by the charged pahs rather than electrons , and the reduction in accretion rate is in general no more than the case with @xmath12 m grains ( see the next subsection ) .      a more quantitative estimate of the disk accretion rate is discussed in @xcite ( see their section 4.3 ) . the predicted accretion rate @xmath11 is based on the hypothesis that mri tends to arrange the field configuration to maximize the rate of angular momentum transport , and is optimistic . to demonstrate the role of tiny grains more extensively ,",
    "we perform our calculations for both the mmsn model and the more massive desch s disk model at a wide range of disk radii from 1 au to 100 au , and consider pah abundances of @xmath197 , @xmath198 ( fiducial ) and @xmath129 . in addition , we conduct one calculation with cosmic - ray ionization turned off at @xmath130 for both disk models . in figure",
    "[ fig : acrate ] , we show the predicted @xmath11 as a function of disk radius for all our calculations . this figure is to be compared with figure 4 of @xcite , who considered the cases with @xmath12 m and @xmath199 m grains .",
    "we see that the inclusion of tiny grains makes the predicted @xmath11 comparable to that with solar abundance @xmath12 m grains at 1 au , which is one to two orders magnitude smaller than the grain - free case .",
    "however , at larger disk radii , tiny grains promote accretion compared with sub - micron grains , with predicted rate that even exceeds the grain - free case .",
    "below we discuss the effect of pahs in more detail .",
    "we find that whenever the active layer extends to the disk midplane ( the gray area touches the vertical axis in figure [ fig : constrain ] , which makes the ohmic resistivity irrelevant ) , the predicted @xmath11 in the presence of pahs exceeds the grain - free case , and the reason is simply due to the reduction of ad coefficients as discussed in the previous two subsections .",
    "this occurs at disk radii @xmath200 au for @xmath201 and @xmath198 , and for @xmath202 au for @xmath197 .",
    "inside the transition radius @xmath8 , accretion is layered and the predicted @xmath11 is well below that in the grain - free case due to ohmic resistivity as discussed at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "the increase in predicted @xmath11 near @xmath8 is very sharp , which is closely related to dependence of @xmath184 on magnetic field strength shown in figure [ fig : model ] , and is discussed in more detail in the appendix .",
    "an interesting and counterintuitive fact is that higher pah abundance leads to faster accretion at all disk radii .",
    "this fact can be understood as follows .",
    "first of all , near the base of the active layer , we find that charged grain abundance is so much higher than the electron abundance that the ohmic resistivity is determined by charged grains rather than electrons ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) .",
    "therefore , even the abundance of free electrons rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath131 , the ohmic resistivity approximately stays at the same level ( while still much larger than the grain - free resistivity ) .",
    "secondly , as we mentioned in the discussion after equation ( [ eq : ngrpm ] ) , the grain ionization level @xmath169 increases weakly with the total grain abundance @xmath131 .",
    "this fact reduces both the ohmic resistivity and the ad coefficient , which leads to faster accretion . only at @xmath203 au , and when @xmath131 is small ( @xmath45 or less ) , does the ohmic resistivity at the base of the active layer determined by electrons , which produces higher accretion rate than larger @xmath131 cases .",
    "we see that in the presence of pahs , the predicted @xmath11 increases with disk radius for @xmath204 where accretion is layered , and falls off with radius for @xmath205 as the disk midplane is activated .",
    "also , larger disk surface density generally leads to smaller @xmath11 in the inner disk when accretion is layered ( although not by much ) , while when the disk midplane becomes active in the outer disk , the desch s disk model gives higher @xmath11 .",
    "these features are all consistent with the results presented in @xcite , where explanations are offered ( see section 5.1 ) .    in addition , we see in the dash - dotted line of figure [ fig : acrate ] that when cosmic - ray ionization is turned off ( since it may be shielded by protostellar winds ) , the predicted @xmath11 is almost indistinguishable with our fiducial case at the inner 10 au .",
    "the predicted @xmath11 still exceeds that in the grain - free case in the outer disk , with the transition radius @xmath8 slightly larger than that in the fiducial calculation , and the increase in @xmath11 near @xmath8 is less sharp . beyond @xmath8 ,",
    "the accretion rate reduction is generally within a factor of @xmath206 of the fiducial result .",
    "these results are all consistent with @xcite , where it is shown and discussed that the deeper - penetrating cosmic - ray ionization does not substantially enhance the accretion rate compared with the x - ray ionization ( see section 5.2 ) .    finally , we emphasize that the existence of @xmath8 and the fact that @xmath11 increases with @xmath131 holds only when pahs are sufficiently abundant ( @xmath207 ) . for comparison , we also show in figure [ fig : acrate ] with cross symbols the predicted accretion rate at selected disk radii with @xmath208 . at small radius of @xmath209 au ,",
    "the predicted @xmath11 is well above the cases with higher pah abundances .",
    "this is because the free electrons is much more abundant so that electron conductivity dominates grain conductivity , and gives smaller resistivity .",
    "the disk midplane becomes active at @xmath210 au , but we do not find the sharp jump in the predicted @xmath11 as in the case with higher pah abundances , and the predicted accretion rate is also smaller by a factor of up to 100 .",
    "this is because @xmath131 is so small that the grain number density is well below @xmath1 ( so @xmath211 ) and the effects we discussed before no longer apply .",
    "the role of pahs in ppds has been recently studied by @xcite . besides the fact that they used a more stringent criterion for ad to suppress the mri , the @xmath184 values they obtained",
    "were largely underestimated because they adopted the simple formulae ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) without taking into account the contribution from grains .",
    "this has led them to conclude that the presence of pahs makes the mri too inefficient to drive rapid accretion at all disk radii , although as we have shown that pahs in fact promote accretion in the outer disk , and at all disk radii the predicted accretion rate generally increases with pah abundance .",
    "our findings are subsequently confirmed in their follow - up work @xcite with corrected grain conductivities .",
    "m grains with fixed mass fraction of @xmath212 and pahs with abundance @xmath213 and @xmath129 .",
    "comparison is made to the grain - free case ( black solid ) and case with single population of @xmath12 m grains ( black dash - dotted).,width=340 ]    our study so far have considered only single - species of grains . in reality ,",
    "tiny grains coexist with larger grains with the latter dominates the grain mass ( but not necessarily abundance ) .",
    "to justify our findings in a more realistic context , we conduct another set of calculations with two populations of grains .",
    "besides the pah population with @xmath213 and @xmath129 that contributes a negligible amount of mass , we add the second population of @xmath12 m grains with fixed mass fraction of @xmath212 . in figure",
    "[ fig : acmix ] , we show the predicted accretion rate as a function of disk radius in the same way as figure [ fig : acrate ] . for comparison , we also plot the predicted @xmath11 in the grain - free case ( black solid ) and the pure @xmath12 m grain case ( black dash - dotted ) taken from @xcite .",
    "we see that at fixed pah abundance with @xmath214 , the predicted @xmath11 with two grain populations is very close to that in our previous calculations with a single pah population , and it behaves as if the @xmath12 m grains do not exist . in particular , the sharp enhancement of accretion beyond the transition radius",
    "is clearly present , and the predicted @xmath11 increases with @xmath131 . at @xmath197 ,",
    "the situation is marginal : with the addition of @xmath12 m grains , the signature of sharp transition is less obvious , which occurs at @xmath215 au , and beyond @xmath8 the predicted @xmath11 is still less than that in the grain - free case . in fact , the behavior of the two - population calculation at @xmath197 roughly lies in between the two single - population limits .",
    "our results are consistent with chemistry studies by @xcite which indicate that different grain populations tend to behave independently .",
    "therefore , the outcome of a size distribution of grains is mainly determined by the grain population that dominates the recombination process .",
    "@xcite found that the controlling parameter of the recombination lies in between the total surface area and the grain abundance weighted by linear size .",
    "as an approximation we weigh the grain abundance by @xmath216 and find that pahs and @xmath12 m sized grains contribute roughly equally to the recombination process when @xmath217 , consistent with our findings discussed in the previous paragraph .    in sum , the effect of tiny grains studied in this paper is approximately independent of the presence of larger grains , and we quote @xmath197 as the critical tiny grain abundance above which enhancement of accretion is possible in the outer regions of ppds .",
    "tiny grains are important charge carriers in weakly ionized gas and strongly affect the non - ideal mhd effects when their abundance is above the ionization fraction .",
    "we generalize the commonly used simple expressions for non - ideal mhd diffusion coefficients ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) to incorporate the effect of charged tiny grains .",
    "we show that at sufficiently small ionization level , tiny grains become the dominant charge carriers , and the non - ideal mhd diffusion coefficients behave very differently from the grain - free case .",
    "the ohmic conductivity is dominated by charged grains rather than electrons when @xmath2 exceeds about @xmath218 . in the ad regime ( strong magnetic field ) ,",
    "hall and ad coefficients are strongly reduced by a factor of about @xmath5 relative to those in the ohmic regime ( weak magnetic field ) , and for sufficiently large @xmath3 , hall dominated regime diminishes .",
    "we study the role of tiny grains on the mri driven accretion in ppds , and find that novel behaviors occur when the tiny grains are sufficiently abundant with @xmath207 , regardless of whether larger grains are present or not . at the inner disk where accretion is layered",
    ", the predicted accretion rate in the presence of tiny grains is one to two orders of magnitude less than the grain - free case due to increased ohmic resistivity , but is similar to or higher than that with solar - abundance @xmath12 m grains .",
    "a sharp increase in the predicted @xmath11 occurs at the transition radius @xmath219 au ( in the fiducial model ) where the disk midplane becomes active , making ohmic resistivity irrelevant to the accretion rate .",
    "quite unexpectedly , we find that at @xmath205 , tiny grains make accretion even more rapid than the grain - free case . moreover , our predicted accretion rate increases with pah abundance .",
    "these results are due to that at large pah abundance , ionization - recombination balance makes @xmath2 orders of magnitude larger than @xmath1 , and even exceeds the grain - free electron density @xmath120 at disk midplane .",
    "these facts prevent ohmic resistivity from rapidly increasing as @xmath131 increases , reduce the dissipation by ad , thus facilitate the active layer to extend deeper into the disk midplane and permit stronger mri turbulence .",
    "our results highlight the importance of evaluating the full conductivity tensor in the calculation of the non - ideal mhd diffusion coefficients rather than using the simple grain - free formulae ( [ eq : diff0 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the effects studied in this paper mainly apply to tiny grains ( @xmath220 m ) , and when they are sufficiently abundant ( @xmath207 ) . for grains larger than @xmath12 m",
    ", their abundance is at most @xmath221 per h@xmath7 molecule ( for having 1@xmath222 of mass ) , which is orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "the reduction of ad coefficient also exist for these relatively larger grains , as can be seen in the bottom panels of figure 3 in @xcite , but its effect is much more limited than the tiny grain case .",
    "when large grains and tiny grains coexist , the effect of large grains becomes negligible if @xmath223 .",
    "although tiny grains strongly enhance ppd accretion in the outer disk , the situation at the inner disk is still similar to the case with @xmath12 m grains @xcite , with predicted accretion rate much less than the typical value of @xmath224 yr@xmath15 as inferred from observations @xcite",
    ". the recently proposed far ultraviolet ( fuv ) ionization scenario does not provide large accretion rate in the inner disk either due to the small penetration depth of fuv photons @xcite . therefore , either additional ionization sources has to make the mri more efficient than the x - rays and fuv photons ( candidate may include energetic protons from the protostars @xcite ) , or additional mechanism such as magnetized wind @xcite operates to provide the angular momentum transport in the inner disk .    in the case of transitional disks characterized by inner holes or gaps @xcite",
    ", we note that the observationally inferred outer boundary of the holes or gaps is typically at a few tens of au @xcite , which is generally greater than @xmath8 in our models with pahs .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of accretion by tiny grains works effectively for transitional disks , and x - ray driven mri with pahs is able to feed the inner hole /gap at the ( optimistic ) rate of about @xmath224 yr@xmath15 .",
    "this is sufficient to account for the observed accretion rate in transitional disks @xcite , with the accreting gas fed from the outer disk flowing through the hole / gap possibly guided by multiple planets @xcite .",
    "x .- n.b thanks jim stone and jeremy goodman for carefully reading the manuscript with comments , and bruce draine for useful discussions on pahs .",
    "comments from daniel perez - becker and the referee , eugene chiang , are especially acknowledged which lead to several improvements to this work .",
    "this work is supported by nasa headquaters under the nasa earth and space science fellowship program grant nnx09aq90h awarded to x.n.b .",
    "it has been shown in figure [ fig : acrate ] and discussed in section [ ssec : parameter ] that near the transition radius @xmath8 where the disk midplane becomes active , the predicted accretion rate @xmath11 increases sharply with radius , from well below the grain - free rate at @xmath10 to a factor of several higher at @xmath13 .",
    "we discuss the activation of the midplane by the mri in this appendix and explain the sharp dependence of @xmath11 on disk radius near @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : transition ] shows the mri permitted region in our fiducial model at 10 and 16 au between which lies the transition radius .",
    "we see from this plot that much stronger magnetic field is permitted in the disk midplane once it is activated , which is the cause of the big jump in @xmath11 .",
    "looking more closely into the sharp transition , we find it is related to the dependence of the ad elsasser number @xmath184 on the magnetic field strength .",
    "we have shown in figure [ fig : model ] that @xmath24 depends on the magnetic field quadratically in weak ( @xmath93 ) and strong ( @xmath95 ) field regimes as commonly considered , but at the intermediate regime with @xmath94 , @xmath24 behaves similarly as @xmath186 and does not depend on the magnetic field strength .",
    "consequently , the contours of ohmic and ad elsasser numbers @xmath185 and @xmath184 are nearly parallel to each other , and both shapes are close to ( near the midplane ) or slightly steeper ( near the surface ) than the contours of constant @xmath67 , as can be seen in figure [ fig : transition ] . in the mean time , an increase of ionization level ( as one moves to outer radius ) brings down the @xmath184 and @xmath185 contours relative to the @xmath67 contour in a wide range of disk heights .",
    "then , according to our criteria for the mri to operate ( @xmath187 and @xmath225 ) , once the ionization level in the disk reaches some critical degree ( i.e. , left panel of figure [ fig : transition ] ) , a further increase in ionization would suddenly make both criteria satisfied simultaneously across the midplane ( i.e. , right panel of figure [ fig : transition ] ) , leading to the sharp transition .",
