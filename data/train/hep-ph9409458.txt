    "the vacuum stability requirement in the ( sm ) imposes a severe lower bound on the mass of the higgs boson , @xmath0 [ 1 - 4 ] , which depends on the mass of the top quark @xmath5 and on the cut - off @xmath6 beyond which the sm is no longer valid . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is due to the fact that the top yukawa coupling , @xmath7 , drives the quartic coupling of the higgs potential , @xmath8 , to negative values at large scales , thus destabilizing the standard electroweak vacuum .",
    "this bound is very relevant for us since it lies in a region that could be accesible for present ( lep , tevatron ) and future ( lep-200 , lhc ) accelerators .",

    "however , it has been shown that the one - loop corrections to the higgs potential are important in order to fix the boundary conditions for the electroweak breaking and calculate the higgs mass in a consistent and scale - independent way . as we will see , they are also significant to properly understand the whole structure of the potential . in section",
    "2 we write the one - loop corrected higgs potential , giving the general conditions for extremals . in section",
    "3 we apply the previous results to the determination of the realistic sm vacuum ( which implies a relationship between the boundary conditions of the sm parameters ) and the physical higgs mass up to next - to - leading - log order . for a given top mass , there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath0 and the boundary condition for @xmath11 .",
    "we discuss also in this section the differences between our approach and previous calculations . in section 4",
    "we study the form of the higgs potential for large @xmath3 and determine under which circumstances it develops a maximum and an additional minimum .",
    "this allows us to define the conditions for vacuum stability in the sm , from which we extract the lower bound on @xmath0 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in section 5",
    "we present our complete numerical results .",

    "this is illustrated for the higgs mass with a representative example in fig .  1 ( solid line ) .",
    "the lack of flatness of @xmath0 reflects the effect of all non - considered ( higher order ) contributions in the calculation and , therefore , it is a measure of the total error in our estimate of @xmath0 . from fig .",
    "1 we can see that the error is typically @xmath62 3 gev , which is the uncertainty we should assign to our results .",
    "the dashed line is the corresponding result performing the previous calculations just with the ( rge improved ) tree - level part of @xmath2 in eq .",

    "@xcite , results in an error in the estimate of @xmath0 , whose precise value depends on the top mass and is typically of @xmath64 , showing the need of a more careful treatment of the problem , as the one exposed above .    finally , let us note that in the previous equations the top yukawa coupling , @xmath27 , enters in several places .",
    "therefore , the higgs mass depends on the boundary condition chosen for @xmath27 , and thus on the top mass @xmath5 .",
    "however the running top mass , defined as @xmath65 , does not coincide with the physical ( pole ) mass , @xmath5 . in the landau gauge the relationship between the running @xmath66 and the physical ( pole ) mass @xmath5 is given by  @xcite [ mtphys ] m_t=\\{1 + + ( ) ^2 } m_t(m_t ) . where @xmath67 , @xmath68 represent the masses of the five lighter quarks .    summarizing the results of this section , for a given top mass and a boundary condition for @xmath11 ,",
    "the boundary condition of @xmath47 is obtained from the electroweak breaking constraint , and is given by eq.([bcm ] ) .",
    "then , the higgs mass , @xmath0 , can be calculated from eq.([mhphys ] ) .",
    "the structure of maxima and minima of @xmath2 for large @xmath3 can be studied with the equations ( [ first ] ) and ( [ secondbis ] ) , evaluated at a scale @xmath31 within the region where @xmath2 is scale - invariant . as was discussed in @xcite and in the previous section , @xmath69 is always a correct choice ( other choices , such that @xmath70 , are equally valid and lead to the same results ) .",

    "we see that , if @xmath2 develops an extremal for large values of @xmath3 , this must occur for a value of @xmath3 such that [ lext ] 0<[(t)=(t)]1 . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath3 eq .",
    "( [ secondbis ] ) can be very accurately expressed as [ secblarge ] .|_(t)= _",
    "ext(t ) & = & ( _ -4)^2(t ) . since near the extremum @xmath71 , and thus @xmath8 , is very small , we see from ( [ secblarge ] ) that depending on the sign of @xmath41 we will have a maximum or a minimum .",
    "we have illustrated these features in fig .  2 with a typical example .",
    "2a represents the evolution of @xmath8 ( dashed line ) and @xmath71 ( solid line ) with @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noticing that they do not cross the horizontal axis at the same value of @xmath31 , but they differ by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "this is important since the point where the maximum of the potential is located , say @xmath72 , does correspond to @xmath73 rather than @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "( [ lext ] ) ) .",
    "this is apparent in fig .  2b , where the scalar potential , @xmath1 , has been represented that has been plotted in fig .",
    "2b has been chosen in order to give a continuous and faithful representation of @xmath2 in logarithmic units . ] . the open diamond and square in fig .",
    "2a correspond to the position of the maximum and the minimum , respectively , of @xmath1 .",
    "notice also that for values of @xmath3 very slightly higher than @xmath72 , the potential is negative and much deeper than the realistic minimum .",
    "this is simply because for values of @xmath31 just beyond @xmath75 , the value of @xmath71 becomes negative and the potential is dominated by the contribution @xmath76 ( compare eqs .",
    "( [ veff ] ) and ( [ lambdahat ] ) ) .",
    "consequently , a sensible criterion for a model to be safe is to require one of the two following conditions :    _ a ) _ : :    the potential has no maximum . _",
    "b ) _ : :    the maximum occurs for @xmath77 ,    where we recall that @xmath6 is the cut - off beyond which the is no longer valid . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath78 gev . with this criterion [ in particular condition ( _ b _ ) ]",
    "we see that the model represented in fig .",
    "2 is acceptable for @xmath79 gev . beyond this scale",
    "the stability of the vacuum requires the appearance of new physics .",
    "note from this discussion that conditions ( _ a _ ) , ( _ b _ ) are not equivalent to require @xmath80 for @xmath81 , as is usually done . instead , the significant parameter is @xmath71 rather than @xmath82 .",
    "we have represented in fig .",
    "3 the evolution of @xmath71 for a set of models with the same value of @xmath5 as the previous one ( @xmath83 gev ) , but with different boundary conditions for @xmath11 , and thus different values of @xmath0 ( obtained as explained in sect .  3 ) .",
    "the thickest line ( @xmath84 gev ) , which is tangent to the horizontal axis at @xmath85 gev , represents a limiting case : for @xmath86 gev the potential has no maximum and therefore is completely safe for any choice of @xmath6 [ see condition ( _ a _ ) above ] ; for @xmath87 gev the models are safe depending on the value of @xmath88 .",
    "hence , for @xmath89 the lower bound on @xmath0 is insensitive to the value of @xmath6 .",
    "the situation depicted in this example , i.e. for @xmath83 gev , typically occurs when the top mass is rather small , since then the top yukawa coupling is too small at large scales to maintain @xmath41 negative [ see eq . ( [ betas ] ) ] .",
    "when the top mass is higher the situation is different and is illustrated with the case @xmath90 gev in fig .",
    "we see that for each value of @xmath0 , @xmath91 crosses the horizontal axis at most once , and there is a value of @xmath0 for which the cross occurs at @xmath92 gev . in consequence , for @xmath93 gev there is a one - to - one correspondence between the choice of @xmath6 and the value of the lower bound on @xmath0 .    finally , we would like to point out that generically the potential is _ not _ unbounded from below since whenever there is a maximum , there is an additional minimum for a larger value of @xmath3 , as illustrated in fig .  2b .",
    "this is because @xmath71 gets back to the positive rage for large enough scales .",
    "hence , the potential becomes eventually positive and monotonically increasing , although in some cases , e.g. for @xmath90",
    "gev , this occurs for values of @xmath3 beyond @xmath94 gev .",
    "as stated in the introduction and has become clear in previous sections , the lower bound on @xmath0 is a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , apart from the previously estimated error @xmath62 3 gev in our calculation , there is an additional source of uncertainty coming from the value of @xmath95 , which enters in several places in the previous calculation .",
    "the most recent estimate of @xmath95 gives @xcite [ alphas ] _",
    "s=0.1240.006 . using the central value of ( [ alphas ] ) ,",
    "we have represented in fig .",
    "5 the lower bound on @xmath0 as a function of @xmath5 for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "the form of the curves is easily understandable from the discussion of the previous section . in fig .  6 , which corresponds to the pure sm case , we have fixed @xmath6 at its maximum value , @xmath92 gev , and represented the lower bound on @xmath0 for the central value of @xmath95 in ( [ alphas ] ) ( diagonal solid line ) and the two extreme values ( diagonal dashed lines ) .",
    "if we use the recent evidence for the top quark production at cdf with a mass @xmath96 gev @xcite , we obtain the following lower bound on @xmath0 : [ 174bound ] m_h > 12833  gev , i.e. @xmath97 95 gev ( 1@xmath98 ) . if the higgs is observed in the present or forthcoming accelerators with a mass below the bound of eq .",
    "( [ 174bound ] ) , this would be a clear signal of new physics beyond the .    comparing these bounds with the last evaluation performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that our values of @xmath0 are lower than in @xcite by an amount which increases with @xmath5 , going from @xmath99 gev for @xmath100 gev , to @xmath101 gev for @xmath102 gev . as has been discussed in sect .  3",
    ", the main reason of this difference is the way in which the higgs mass was computed in ref .",
    "accordingly , our results give more room to the higgs mass in the framework of the standard model .",
    "it is very interesting to perform a comparison between the sm _ lower _ bounds on @xmath0 previously obtained and the supersymmetric _ upper _ bounds on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall that in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the higgs quartic coupling is not a free parameter , but is given by a certain combination of the @xmath103 , @xmath104 gauge couplings .",
    "thus , experimental data constrain the boundary condition for @xmath8 , which can not be as large as we want , leading to strong upper bounds on @xmath0 at large scales remains always positive and hence there are no corresponding lower bounds on @xmath0 from vacuum stability in the mssm . ] .",
    "these bounds depend on three parameters ( besides @xmath5 ) : @xmath105 , i.e. the scale below which supersymmetry ( susy ) decouples ( from naturality reasons @xmath106 tev @xcite ) ; @xmath107 , i.e. the ratio @xmath108 of the two supersymmetric higgs doublets ; and @xmath109 , i.e. the mixing between stops , which is responsible for the threshold correction to the higgs quartic coupling . the larger threshold correction and @xmath107 , the less stringent the susy bounds .",
    "therefore , the most conservative situation takes place considering maximum threshold correction ( which is achieved for @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 .",
    "likewise , the larger @xmath105 , the less stringent the bounds ; but , as mentioned above , it is not sensible to consider @xmath105 much larger than @xmath112 tev . consequently , to be in the safe side , we have represented in fig .",
    "6 the mssm upper bounds ( transverse solid and dashed lines ) , as recently obtained up to next - to - leading - log order in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the most conservative situation with @xmath113 tev .",
    "of course , since in the susy case @xmath105 indicates the appearance of new physics , the supersymmetric upper bounds must be consistent with the sm lower bounds for @xmath114 , as in fact they are .",
    "however , setting @xmath92 gev , i.e. the pure sm case , as in fig .  6 , we find that this is not so for all the top masses , leading to an interesting situation .",
    "we can distinguish three zones in fig .",
    "6 :    _ i ) _ : :    for @xmath115 gev , i.e. the crossing area of the sm    and mssm curves , the eventually measured higgs mass will be compatible    either with the pure sm or with the mssm , but not with both at the    same time ( unless @xmath116 with high accuracy ) .",
    "accordingly , the experimental higgs mass either will discard the mssm    or will be a clear signal of new physics beyond the sm compatible with    the mssm . _",
    "ii ) _ : :    for @xmath117 gev , the situation is analogous , but there    is a wider range of higgs masses ( area within the two curves )    compatible with both sm and mssm .",
    "_ iii ) _ : :    for @xmath118 gev , there is no region of higgs masses    compatible with the sm and mssm simultaneously . on the contrary there",
    "is a range of @xmath0 ( within the two curves ) which would    discard both .",
    "perhaps the most interesting situation is ( _ i _ ) , which occurs precisely for a top mass in the central value of the cdf experimental estimate .    in order to facilitate the comparison between the pure sm and the mssm",
    ", we give below fits of the corresponding bounds on @xmath0 , valid for 150 gev @xmath119 gev and within @xmath120 gev of error .",

    "_ note added _ : after this work was finished we received a preprint by g. altarelli and g. isidori @xcite , where the sm lower bound on @xmath0 is refined using a different approach .",
