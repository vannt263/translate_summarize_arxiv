    "[ introduction ]    in 2015 , two hidden charm pentaquark resonances @xmath13 and @xmath14 were reported by lhcb collaboration in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum in the @xmath15 process  @xcite .",

    "are believed to have five intrinsic quark content @xmath22 , and their isospins are @xmath23 .    in the following paper ,",
    "lhcb collaboration reported the branching fraction of the decay @xmath15 and branching ratios @xmath24  @xcite , @xmath25",
    "@xmath26 @xmath27 however , the available experimental data are insufficient to determine the values of @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to the conventional mesons ( @xmath29 ) and baryons ( @xmath30 ) , the exotic states , such as tetraquark , pentaquark , and dibaryons , are also allowed by color confinement . in the past decades , lots of @xmath31 states",
    "have been observed , which can be hardly described as conventional mesons in traditional quark models  @xcite .",
    "most of them , especially the @xmath32 and @xmath33 states , should have four quark content .",
    "a structure of @xmath34 has been reported in double - pion fusion reactions and their partial wave analyses  @xcite , which may have six quark content .",
    "the observation of two pentaquark states @xmath7 and @xmath8 provides a unique perspective to the nature of exotic states .    before the discovery of @xmath12 states , there have already been some theoretical studies on the existence of hidden charm pentaquark states with meson - baryon and meson - meson interactions  @xcite .",
    "some hidden charm states are predicted , which may correspond the @xmath12 states or their partners .",
    "moreover , the productions of these states are also discussed within the framework of effective lagrangian approach  @xcite .    inspired by the observation of @xmath12 states , many interesting theoretical works have been presented .",
    "according to the diquark picture , the two @xmath12 states are interpreted as compact pentaquarks , where the five quarks are tightly bound and interact with each other via color magnetic interaction directly  @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the @xmath12 resonances are molecular states composed of one meson and one baryon , which are loosely bounded and interact through color van der waals interaction and boson exchange interaction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the non - resonant interpretations of these two structures also exist , which suggest that the @xmath12 states are not genuine states , but kinematical effects due to re - scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "detailed discussions of various assignments and properties can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the production mechanism of these two @xmath12 are also investigated by some works . in analogy to @xmath15 ,",
    "the @xmath12 states and their partners can be produced in weak decay processes of bottom baryons  @xcite . since the anomalous triangle singularity kinematical effects do not exist in the two body final states reactions ,",
    "the photon and pion induced productions are suggested to clarify the nature of @xmath12 states  @xcite .",
    "other production processes , such as heavy ion collisions  @xcite , proton - nucleus collisions  @xcite , and @xmath35 reaction  @xcite , are also proposed .    besides the mass spectrum and production mechanism",
    ", the decay behaviors of @xmath12 states can also provide beneficial information of their structures .",
    "however , there are only a few studies on decay properties . burns discussed possible decay patterns of @xmath12 states under various scenarios according to quantum number conservations  @xcite .",
    "eides , petrov and polyakov calculated the @xmath36 partial decay width of @xmath8 as a bound state of charmonium @xmath37 and nucleon .",
    "wang , li , liu and zhu performed a comprehensive study with the heavy quark symmetry and spin rearrangement scheme , where the @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and @xmath11 molecular candidates are considered  @xcite .",
    "independent of dynamical mechanism , several ratios of partial widths of some decay channels are estimated .",
    "particularly , wu , molina , oset , and zou gave a pioneer investigation on decay behaviors of the predicted hidden charm states  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the masses of @xmath2 systems with different partial waves have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "some works suggested that @xmath2 molecule stands for the @xmath7 state  @xcite , while others support it as @xmath8 resonance  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we will investigate the strong decay mode @xmath3 of @xmath12 states under @xmath2 molecule assignments with spin - parity @xmath38 .",
    "within the framework of effective lagrangians approach , the technique for evaluating composite hadron systems have been widely used for various molecular states , where the compositeness condition , corresponding to @xmath39 has been employed  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 molecules are also discussed in the heavy quark limit .",
    "these explorations can give the predicted partial decay widths of @xmath12 states , which will help us to distinguish between different interpretations to be tested by future experiments .",
