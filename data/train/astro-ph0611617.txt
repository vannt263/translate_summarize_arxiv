    "despite the numerous studies associating galaxy interactions with enhanced star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much progress is still to be made in the understanding of the physics of this process . whilst it is clear that interactions can lead to enhanced star formation it is equally clear that they do not do so with ubiquity .    in a study of interacting systems",
    "@xcite find that star formation in the nuclear region is more sensitive than the disk to the effects of interactions .",
    "this observation was first reported by in studies of radio emission from interacting systems and was subsequently corroborated by the h@xmath1 study of @xcite .",
    "more recently , observed a moderate increase in the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in the central regions of interacting galaxies but found the global star formation properties did not differ significantly from normal isolated systems .",
    "evidence that galaxy interactions have a more marked effect on the nuclear rather than disk properties of galaxies is supported by @xmath3-body simulations which suggest that interactions can drive a large fraction of gas into the central regions of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the distribution of star formation triggered in interacting galaxies is not clear cut . whilst many observations of interacting systems , including those of the most extreme star formation found in ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , indicate centrally concentrated star formation , observations over a range of wavelengths reveal a number of interacting galaxies with more extended star formation .",
    "the antennae galaxies ( ngc  4038/39 ) are an obvious example : despite abundant dense gas in the two galactic centres , the most intense star formation is found in the overlap region between the two galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly , many interacting systems exhibit bright spiral arm regions ; a notable and well studied example is m51 .",
    "star formation is also found in the very extended regions of interacting galaxies , for example in tidal dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shells and large complexes in the outer regions as in m101 or ngc  628 @xcite .",
    "questions about the nature of star formation in interacting galaxies are linked to those surrounding fuelling and the distribution of molecular gas ; if star formation is to occur there must exist an adequate and ongoing supply of gas .",
    "interactions can disrupt the axi - symmetry of the galactic potential leading to gas inflow toward the central region .",
    "a number of studies have observed enhanced and centrally condensed molecular gas emission in interacting systems , although there is a bias towards more evolved interactions showing significant perturbation , systems that are likely to be merger candidates",
    ".    one important mode by which interactions can disrupt the galactic potential is by the triggering of bar formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations indicate bars can lead to gas flow towards the central regions of galaxies , results that are borne out by the observational studies which reveal enhanced molecular gas emission in the centres of barred systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite , who studied a sample of 50 nearby spirals  including both late type barred and unbarred spirals , and co - bright and co - faint galaxies  found the effect of the bar equally pronounced in late and early hubble type spirals .",
    "they also note that in the case of some early - type barred spirals there is little or no gas within the bar , which is consistent with higher accretion rates provided these galaxies have undergone a starburst .",
    "understanding of the process of star formation in merge in local systems , which can be studied in detail , is necessary for studies of star formation at higher redshifts , where mergers are more frequent .",
    "here we undertake a detailed examination of the atomic and molecular gas in , and star forming properties of ngc  275 , the late - type , weakly barred spiral ( classified as sb(rs)cd pec ) galaxy that is one component of the interacting , spiral - lenticular pair arp  140 .",
    "the other component of arp 140 is the early - type system ngc  274 ( classified as sab(r)0@xmath4pec ) .",
    "this is one of a small sample of nine spiral  elliptical interacting pairs , which have been studied by and @xcite . in undertaking these studies",
    "we hope to shed light on the possible effects of interaction on late - type spiral systems and the processes which may have shaped and will continue to shape ngc  275 s evolution .",
    "the recessional velocity of both ngc  275 and ngc  274 is 1750 @xmath5 @xcite , assuming an hubble constant of 70 km  s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , this corresponds to a distance of 25  mpc , which is used is this paper .",
    "the projected major axis diameter ( @xmath7 ) for both ngc  274 and ngc  275 is 10.9  kpc ( 1.5 arcmin ) and the angular separation of the pair is @xmath8 , giving a small projected linear separation of 5.3  kpc .",
    "broadband optical @xmath9-band and narrowband h@xmath1 images of arp 140 were obtained at the 2.3-m telescope at siding spring observatory on the 2002 october 6th .",
    "the observations were taken with a @xmath10 ccd with a field of view of @xmath11 , and plate scale of 24.82 arcsec mm@xmath6 .",
    "the redshifted h@xmath1 line of arp 140 appears at 660.1 nm and was isolated using a 5.0 nm filter centred on 658.5 nm .",
    "six 5-minute exposures of arp 140 were observed at @xmath12 offsets in the h@xmath1 filter ; short exposures were taken to avoid tracking problems .",
    "a 60  s exposure was taken in @xmath9-band for continuum subtraction .",
    "exposures were made under photometric conditions and the spectral standard star g158@xmath4100 was observed with both the narrowband and broadband filters to allow calibration of the images .",
    "the images were bias and flat - field corrected .",
    "the individual narrowband images were then aligned , co - added and the red continuum subtracted to produce the final image of 1800  s total integration time and @xmath13 arcsec spatial resolution with a pixel scale of @xmath14 per pixel .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + ( 1 ) region number : regions are shown in fig .  [ regions.fig ] . ( 2 ) area of region in kpc@xmath15 . (",
    "3 ) the h@xmath1 flux for region in question . ( 4 ) the reddening observed in magnitudes using the 2mass @xmath16 colour difference image .",
    "a second possibility is that molecular hydrogen has been dissociated by uv photons from the regions of current star formation and/or molecular gas is dissociated and ionised .",
    "there is no evidence for large - scale dissociation of molecular hydrogen to atomic hydrogen in the vicinity of the regions  if this were to occur we would expect an anti - correlation between the atomic and molecular gas , however we see no such effect when comparing the and images",
    ". we can also rule out substantial ionisation . modelling the observed h@xmath1 peaks as individual regions we can estimate an upper limit to the column density of ionised hydrogen which we find to be typically @xmath17 @xmath18 , which is more than three orders of magnitude less than the observed column density of atomic and molecular gas towards the peaks in the molecular gas distribution ( @xmath19 @xmath18 ) .",
    "a third possibility that we explore is that on - going star formation has depleted the molecular gas close to the regions .",
    "we estimate the mass of gas consumed during star formation by taking the current observed star formation rate which is 1.5 m@xmath20 yr@xmath6 , and estimating the timescale over which star formation has been occurring .",
    "to do this we assume that star formation was triggered at perigalacticon , at which point the tidal perturbation would have been a maximum . to estimate the time since we use the observed distribution of in the tidal tail .",
    "the length of semi - circular tidal tail extending to the north of the interacting pair is @xmath21 , corresponding to a physical distance of @xmath22 kpc . assuming the atomic gas associated with ngc  275 was not significantly accelerated during the encounter and has moved ballistically",
    "since it was stripped , we can estimate its velocity from the rotational speed of the galaxy and its orbital velocity in the system as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the rotational velocity of the galaxy from which the tidal tail originated and @xmath25 is the relative radial velocity of the two interacting galaxies .",
    "the interaction between ngc  275 and ngc  274 appears to be largely in the plane of the sky ; both galaxies having the same systemic velocity giving a relative radial velocity of zero . from the rotation curve we estimate the rotational velocity of ngc  275 to be @xmath26 @xmath5 ( corrected for the inclination angle ) .",
    "this spatial extent of the tidal tail and the estimated velocity of the gas give an approximate timescale of interaction of @xmath27 yr .",
    "simple @xmath3-body simulations for this system @xcite give a similar timescale of @xmath28 yr since perigalacticon . together with the current star formation rate this gives for the mass of molecular gas consumed since perigalacticon @xmath29 m@xmath20 ; the upper end of the range represents approximately half the current molecular gas mass in ngc  275 .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that the structure we observe in which the h@xmath1 and molecular gas are spatially anti - correlated is the result of consumption of the molecular gas during an episode of star formation which began at about perigalacticon .",
    "another possible explanation for the observed distribution of molecular gas is that it is a warped molecular disc or ring .",
    "ngc  275 is inclined with respect to the plane of the sky ( inclination angle @xmath30 degrees ) and the systemic velocities of the interacting galaxies are the same .",
    "these facts suggest that the spin angular momentum vector of ngc  275 and the orbital angular momentum vector of the interacting pair are not aligned , conditions consistent with the production of a galactic warp .",
    "the molecular gas in ngc  275 has an s - shaped spatial distribution , which could be indicative of a warped disk .",
    "it is not unreasonable to postulate that the gas and stellar populations ( and hence regions ) have responded differently to the tidal perturbation hence giving rise to an offset between the gas distribution and the stellar disc .",
    "however warps are usually observed on larger physical scales than that of the molecular gas distribution in ngc  275 although a smaller scale warp was recently found in the molecular gas distribution of ngc  3718 ; a system with a companion at 13 mpc .",
    "there is however no evidence for a warp in the distribution ; it therefore seems unlikely that this mechanism could explain the observed distribution of gas .",
    "ngc  275 is at a relatively advanced stage of interaction with an early - type system , ngc  274 .",
    "estimates of the time since perigalacticon indicate a timescale of approximately @xmath31 yr . the galaxy has a relatively normal sfr ( @xmath32 m@xmath20 yr@xmath6 ) , although normalisation of the modest fir luminosity , @xmath33 , by an equally modest molecular gas yields a sizeable star - formation efficiency ( @xmath34 l@xmath20 m@xmath35 ) .",
    "the distribution of molecular gas and regions of star formation are unusual in a number of ways .",
    "neither the molecular gas distribution nor the recent star formation are centrally condensed , although some star formation is occurring in the nucleus indicated by the presence of a nuclear star cluster @xcite .",
    "the star formation is patchy and extended , and there is a strong anti - correlation with the molecular gas .",
    "there is no evidence for a gravitational or dynamical origin of the observed structures ",
    "there is no indication of spiral structure in any data set , and indeed the 2mass @xmath2-band data also show a patchy structure .",
    "although ngc  275 is a barred system , the bar is not strong , nor is the molecular gas aligned with it .",
    "these observations and the analysis of the previous section suggests that the anti - correlation we observe between the sites of current star formation and the molecular gas distribution is most likely explained by the consumption of gas during an episode of star formation which began close to perigalacticon .    in galaxies",
    "in which large - scale structure such as spiral arms organise the star formation systematic offsets are seen between the molecular gas distribution and that of regions @xcite .",
    "these offsets are explained by the time delay between the gas accumulation and onset of star formation .",
    "however , in galaxies which lack such a large - scale driver a more random distribution of offsets are expected . in the late - type galaxy m33 , where spiral structure is weak , @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that regions are often close to giant molecular clouds , but that there are many examples of both molecular clouds with no regions and regions without molecular clouds .",
    "typically there is some offset between the two but the sense of this seems not to be related to the spiral structure .",
    "the situation in ngc 275 is probably closer to that in m33 than in galaxies with strong spiral structure .",
    "the process of star formation in ngc 275 may have followed a more stochastic evolution , with small - scale processes , rather than galaxy - wide perturbations , dominating its evolution .",
    "the lack of correlation between the molecular gas distribution and that of star formation seen in ngc 275 may be a common phenomenon .",
    "@xcite present and interferometric co observations of 10 comparable - mass interacting galaxies , detecting isolated co emission with no optical counterpart in a number of systems .",
    "similarly , @xcite observe no clear correlation between the and co and sites of ongoing star formation in the dwarf starburst ngc 4214 , although the and co velocities agree well .",
    "the irregular nature of the star formation in this galaxy , the absence of correlation between the total gas column density and regions of star formation and the good agreement of the and co dynamics is similar to the situation observed in ngc 275 .",
    "ngc  275 s atomic and molecular gas content will be important in determining its evolution .",
    "consistent with other late - type spiral galaxies , ngc  275 has a modest amount of molecular gas in a relatively extended distribution .",
    "the atomic gas content of ngc  275 is similarly unremarkable , although its morphology is more dramatic : the having largely been stripped with only one - third of the atomic gas still associated with the galaxy .",
    "one of the defining features of the arp 140 pair is that it contains only one late - type , gas - rich galaxy .",
    "this characteristic distinguishes it from the interacting systems that constitute the ulirg population , believed to result from the merger of two gas - rich disks .",
    "@xcite are studying a sample of mergers an order of magnitude less luminous then ulirgs  moderate luminosity mergers with @xmath33 luminosities in the range @xmath36 l@xmath20 .",
    "they suggest that these systems might be the product of a merger between two gas - rich galaxies of _ unequal _ mass or , as is the case for arp 140 , a late - type and early - type galaxy , contrasting such systems with ulirgs , which are believed to result from the merger of two comparable mass gas - rich disks , yielding very centrally condensed molecular gas distributions and fir luminosities in excess of @xmath37 l@xmath20 .",
    "the fir luminosity of ngc  275 places it at the faint end of the manthey et al .",
    "sample ; although , ngc  275 is still a relatively young interaction when compared with these merger systems .    for a star formation rate of 1.5  m@xmath20 yr@xmath6 ( the current rate in ngc  275 ) the timescale for the consumption of the molecular gas is between @xmath38 yr .",
    "we estimate a time to merger of between 3 and @xmath39 yr @xcite .",
    "as ngc  275 approaches merger most of its supply of molecular gas will have been exhausted at the present rate of star formation . unless there is significant conversion of atomic to molecular gas , and also some infall of stripped material , there will not be a sufficient supply of fuel to allow the star formation rate to increase significantly from its present value .",
    "given the timescale required to produce the large tidal tail , ngc  275 is at a relatively advanced stage of interaction with an early - type system .",
    "in contrast to the commonly painted picture of interacting systems , the perturbation experienced by ngc  275 does not appear to have triggered large - scale gas inflow and ensuing centrally enhanced star formation . despite ngc",
    "275 s interacting status and weakly barred potential , neither the molecular gas distribution nor the recent star formation are centrally condensed .",
    "the brightest emission from both the star - formation tracers and the molecular gas are found not in the centre , but offset to the north - west .",
    "the relationship between the molecular gas and h@xmath1 emission in ngc  275 is somewhat unusual ; the two tracers appear to a large extent uncorrelated .",
    "investigation indicates this is unlikely to result from either extinction or ionisation effects . whilst there is some evidence of weak spiral structure in this galaxy , the @xmath2-band image does not indicate an underlying spiral structure in ngc  275 s mass distribution . instead",
    ", the patchy h@xmath1 emission is mirrored by equally patchy @xmath2-band emission ( section  [ 275_star_form_rate.sec ] ) .",
    "ngc  275 appears to be undergoing star formation of a stochastic - like nature , in the sense that it is driven by smaller scale feedback effects , rather than large scale dynamical processes .",
    "this star formation , which may have been enhanced by the interaction , is likely to have contributed to the depletion of molecular gas in certain regions of the galaxy , shaping the observed gas distribution .",
