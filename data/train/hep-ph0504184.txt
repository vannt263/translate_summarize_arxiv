    "recently it is demonstrated that the effect of final state interaction ( fsi ) or initial state interaction ( isi ) can lead to significant azimuthal asymmetries in various high energy scattering processes involving hadrons  @xcite . among these asymmetries ,",
    "single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite and that in drell - yan processes  @xcite from fsi / isi via the exchange of a gluon , have been explored and are recognized as previously known sivers effect  @xcite .",
    "this effect , formerly thought to be forbidden by the time - reversal property of qcd  @xcite , can be survived from time - reversal invariance due to the presence of the path - ordered exponential ( wilson line ) in the gauge - invariant definition of the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions  @xcite . along this direction",
    "some phenomenological studies  @xcite have been carried out on transverse single - spin asymmetries in sidis process , which is under investigation by current experiment  @xcite . analogously the exchange of a gluon can also lead to another leading twist ( naive ) @xmath0-odd distribution @xmath1 : the covariant transversely polarization density of quarks inside an unpolarized hadron .",
    "this chiral - odd partner of sivers effect function , introduced first in ref .",
    "@xcite and is referred to as boer - mulders function , has been proposed  @xcite to account for the large @xmath6 asymmetries in the unpolarized pion - nucleon drell - yan process that were measured more than 10 years ago  @xcite .",
    "recently @xmath1 of the proton has been computed in a quark - scalar diquark model  @xcite and also used to analyze the consequent @xmath2 azimuthal asymmetries in both unpolarized @xmath8 sidis process  @xcite and unpolarized @xmath9 drell - yan process  @xcite respectively .",
    "the same mechanism producing @xmath0-odd distribution functions can be applied to other hadrons such as mesons . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we reported that non - zero @xmath10 of the quark inside the pion ( denoted as @xmath11 ) can also arise from final state interaction , by applying a simple quark spectator - antiquark model . among the phenomenological implications of the function @xmath11",
    "is an important result for the @xmath6 azimuthal asymmetry in the unpolarized @xmath12 drell - yan process  @xcite , which can be produced by the product of @xmath10 of the pion and that of the nucleon .",
    "therefore , one can investigate how the theoretical prediction of the asymmetry is comparable with the experimental result , as a test of the theory and the model . in the present paper , based on @xmath11 from our model calculation , we analyze the @xmath6 azimuthal asymmetry in the unpolarized @xmath3 drell - yan process by considering the kinematical region of na10 experiments  @xcite . to obtain the right @xmath13 dependence of the asymmetry",
    ", we recalculate @xmath5 in a spectator model similar to the model used in ref .",
    "the difference is that here we treat the effective pion - quark - antiquark coupling @xmath14 as a dipole form factor @xmath15 , in contrary to the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite where we take @xmath14 as a constant .",
    "we find that @xmath5 resulting from the new treatment together with @xmath1 for the nucleon in a similar treatment  @xcite can reproduce the @xmath6 asymmetry which agrees with na10 data .",
    "we give the asymmetries predicted by our model averaged over the kinematics of na10 experiments for 140 , 194 and 286  gev @xmath7 beam and find that the energy dependence of these asymmetries is not strong .",
    "in this section , we will show how to calculate @xmath5 in a quark - spectator antiquark model .",
    "we follow ref .  @xcite to work in abelian case at first and then generalize the result to qcd .",
    "there are pion - quark - antiquark interaction and gluon - spectator antiquark interaction in the model : @xmath16 in which @xmath14 is the pion - quark - antiquark effective coupling , and @xmath17 is the charge of the antiquark .",
    "when the intrinsic transverse momentum of the quark is taken into account , as required by @xmath0-odd distributions , the quark correlation function of the pion in feynman gauge ( we perform calculation in this gauge ) is  @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the path - ordered exponential ( wilson line ) accompanied with the quark field which has the form @xmath20 etc .",
    "the wilson line has the importance to make the definition of the distribution / correlation function gauge - invariant . without the constraint of time - reversal invariance , in leading twist",

    "@xcite and @xcite that final state interaction in an initial hadron state can be taken into account effectively by introducing an appropriate wilson line in the gauge - invariant definition of the transverse momentum dependent distribution function , or equivalently , quark correlation function of the hadron .",

    "usually there are two choices of the pion - quark - antiquark coupling @xmath14 :    * case 1 : @xmath14 as a normalization constant which is used in ref .",
