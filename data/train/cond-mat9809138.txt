    "the analytically predicted value of the spin wave velocity at the multicritical point is obtained by substituting @xmath147 into equation ( [ eq : k ] ) , which results in @xmath148 .",
    "the slopes of the bkt lines for @xmath149 and @xmath150 near the multicritical point m are the same with each other .",
    "this can be explained from the symmetry of the bosonized hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sg ] ) .",

    "as the multicritical point m is gone away , on the other hand , the bkt lines on the upper and lower planes are asymmetric with each other , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "this is quite reasonable because the @xmath153 symmetry does not hold in the original spin hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) . from the standpoint of the bosonized hamiltonian , this comes from the existence of higher order terms  @xcite @xmath154 , of which coefficients are also proportional to the trimerization parameter @xmath6 .",
    "if these higher order terms are taken into account , the symmetry of the bosonized hamiltonian under the transformation @xmath151 and @xmath152 is lost , which explains the asymmetry of the bkt lines .    the mass - generating term @xmath155 in the bosonized hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sg ] ) comes from the @xmath156 and @xmath157 couplings of the trimerization .",
    "strictly speaking , there exists another mass - generating term @xmath158 which comes from the @xmath159 coupling of the trimerization .",
    "the effects of equation  ( [ eq : z - trimer ] ) and the @xmath155 term in equation  ( [ eq : sg ] ) are mutually competing when @xmath160 . in the @xmath2 ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic alternating chain  @xcite",
    ", this kind of competition brings about the transition between the haldane state and the large-@xmath161 state . in our case",
    ", however , the term of equation  ( [ eq : z - trimer ] ) only works to reduce the coefficient of @xmath155 in equation  ( [ eq : sg ] ) .",
    "most simple treatment may be the approximation @xmath162 .",
    "in fact , we obtain the phase diagram figure  [ fig : xy - phase - diagram ] for the @xmath163-trimerization model  in which the trimerization exists only in the @xmath156 and @xmath157 couplings and not in the @xmath159 coupling .",
    "we see that the trimerization effect is reduced in figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] in comparison with figure  [ fig : xy - phase - diagram ] , because the no - plateau region is wider in figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] than in figure  [ fig : xy - phase - diagram ] .    [ 0.4]-trimerization model.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we note that the phase boundary of the ferromagnetic region is no longer @xmath164 , because the @xmath165 symmetry is broken even at @xmath166 in the @xmath163-trimerization model .",
