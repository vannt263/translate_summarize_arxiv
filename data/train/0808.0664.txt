    "furthermore , all topologically different types of neutrino events lead the unified numerical oscillation parameters , say , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .    taking into account all factors mentioned above ,",

    "this assumption is that the direction of the incident neutrino is the same as that of emitted lepton(s ) .    in order to avoid any misunderstanding toward the sk assumption on the direction",

    "[ fig:12 ] that _ the sk assumption on the direction _ does not hold as a good estimator for the determination of the directions of the incident neutrinos even if statistically .",
    "finally , we examine the relation between the zenith angle distribution for upward @xmath0 and @xmath65 and the corresponding zenith angle distribution for @xmath3 and @xmath66 in the case of no oscillation . by perfoming the procedure described in appendix c",
    ", we obtain a pair of ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) from a sampling of ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) . in figure  13",
    ", we show the relation between the upward incident neutrino zenith angle distribution and the emitted muon ones thus obtained for the null oscillation . if we guarantee _ the sk assumption on the direction _ , the emitted muon zenith angle distribution is expressed approximately as the incident neutrino zenith angle distribution .",
    "however , the really simulated muon zenith angle distribution is quite different from the incident neutrino zenith angle distribution .",
    "this is the reason why _ the sk assumption on the direction _ does not hold even if statistically .",
    "furthermore , it should be noticed from the figure that the existence of the downward muons from the upward neutrinos could not be neglected which is enhanced by the azimuthal angles in addition to the backscattering . if the neutrino oscillation does not exist , such downward muons do not bring about problems , because in this case the zenith angle distribution of the downward neutrino is symmetrical to that of upward neutrino .",
    "then , the `` inverted leptons '' cancel out totally . however , in the case of the presence of the neutrino oscillation , such cancellation does not occur .",
    "namely , the determination of the direction of the incident neutrinos estimated by the emitted muon should be more carefully treated .",
    "we have shown the invalidity of _ the sk assumption on the direction _ for the analysis of the single ring @xmath3 events among _ fully contained events _ which are solid and free from the interpretation on their interaction types .",
    "super - kamiokande collaboration have examined all possible neutrino events for the neutrino oscillation problem , say , sub - gev e - like events , multi - gev e - like events , sub - gev @xmath3-like events , multi - gev @xmath3-like events , multi - ring sub gev @xmath3-like events , multi - ring multi - gev events , pc events , _ upward stopping muon events _ and _ upward through going muon events _ ( see , @xcite ) , and all possible neutrino events provide the same neutrino oscillation parameters with the same precision accidentally . however , different types of neutrino events have different structures which are accompanied by different experimental uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we could not readily believe such unified conclusions , taking into consideration the different experimental qualities in the different types of events .",
    "the most clear cut events among the sk events are one ring electron like events and muon - like events among _ fully contained events_. in these events , apart from the numerical uncertainties , one could essentially discriminate electron from muon ( see footnote 1 ) , and we decide the directions of the leptons as well as their energies , because we know the interaction points as well as their end points in the detector .",
    "therefore , it is more desirable that one analyze the single - ring electron - like events and single - ring muon - like events among _ fully contained events _ exclusively not being tempted by the increase of statistics . if one really finds the solid evidence for the neutrino oscillation in the most clear cut events , such as _ single ring @xmath3 events _",
    ", then one could find some corroboration for the neutrino oscillation even in the worst quality of experimental data , such as _ upward stopping muon events _ and _ upward through going muon events_.    in the subsequent paper ( part  2 ) , we apply our present result to the analysis of the @xmath11 distribution for _ single ring @xmath3 events _ due to qel among _ fully contained events _ which may lead the direct observation of the neutrino oscillation , if really exists , due to the simplicity of the events concerned .",
    "also , we are now under preparation the third paper ( part  3 ) in which we examine the zenith angle distribution for the same type of the events mentioned above .    in the following appendices we give the concrete monte carlo simulations , namely , the details of our _ time sequential simulation_.",
    "here , we give the monte carlo simulation procedure for obtaining the energy and its direction cosines , @xmath71 , of the emitted lepton in qel for a given energy and its direction cosines , @xmath72 , of the incident neutrino .    the relation among @xmath19 , @xmath73 , the energy of the incident neutrino , @xmath21 , the energy of the emitted lepton ( muon or electron or their anti - particles ) and @xmath22 , the scattering angle of the emitted lepton , is given as @xmath74",
