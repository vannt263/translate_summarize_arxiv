    "a nearly ubiquitous property of ancient globular clusters ( gcs ) so far studied is that they host multiple populations in the form of internal chemical abundance variations in light elements ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "so far , ruprecht 106 and ic  4499 seem to be the only exceptions ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , these variations , which are not observed among field stars of the same metallicity , show correlated patterns in certain elements , e.g. the prominent na - o anti - correlation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the c - n anti - correlation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these chemical anomalies are not only detected in milky way gcs but also in old clusters in nearby dwarf galaxies , like in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite , the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite or the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the na - o and c - n anti - correlations are ideal tracers of the multiple populations in gcs .",
    "these can be detected by spectroscopic analysis of individual stars in a cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite in their study of the gc m4 , combined spectroscopic and photometric data and showed that there is a direct relation between the broadening of the red giant branch ( rgb ) in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and the spectroscopically determined populations with varying na and o abundances ( see @xcite and @xcite for a similar study on ngc  6362 ) .",
    "the different element abundances within the stars influence the colour of the stars in certain filter bands and can therefore result in a broadening or splitting of the various stellar evolutionary stages in the cmd , like the rgb , sub - giant branch ( sgb ) and the main sequence ( ms ) . with the photometric precision of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) combined with the usage of ultraviolet filters it is possible to trace the multiple populations throughout the entire cmd down to the lowest magnitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as multiple populations are even observed along main sequence stars indicates that the formation mechanism must have acted already at early stages of the cluster s life .    as the observed",
    "multiple populations clearly contradict our view of star clusters as simple stellar populations , several scenarios have been put forward to explain this phenomenon in recent years .",
    "most of them involve the formation of more than one generation of stars where the younger stars form out of a mix of pristine gas and the enriched ejected material from stars of the older generations .",
    "the different scenarios propose various types of polluter stars : interacting massive binaries @xcite , fast rotating massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , @xcite proposed the early disk accretion scenario where the accretion disks of low - mass pre - ms stars sweep up enriched material ejected by rotating massive stars of the same generation .",
    "however , all proposed scenarios have severe difficulties accounting for the breadth of observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to produce the observed anti - correlations in certain elements and the fraction of enriched stars , the gcs must have been at least one order of magnitude more massive at birth in scenarios invoking multiple star formation epochs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is referred to as the `` mass - budget problem '' ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a discussion ) . additionally , none of the proposed sources of enriched material is able to reproduce consistently the extent of the observed abundance patterns in gcs @xcite .    as the proposed theories do not require any specific conditions for the formation of multiple populations , they should also be present in younger clusters with comparable observed properties to ancient gcs . several studies aimed to find indications of multiple populations or multiple star formation events in such clusters .",
    "however , up to now no clear evidence is found for either of these indicators in young clusters .",
    "@xcite did not detect any signs of ongoing star formation in a sample of 130 massive ( @xmath5 - @xmath6  m@xmath7 ) clusters with ages between 10  myr and 1  gyr .",

    "we did not subtract any contamination of field stars from the cmd .",
    "we determined a value of 9% of field stars across the cluster field ( see section [ sec : struc ] ) and it should be even less at the post - ms part of ngc  121 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of unrelated field stars to the rgb part of ngc  121 will not affect our overall results .",
    "the resulting cmd is shown in figure  [ fig : ngc121_rgb_hess ] .",
    "we see that the rgb clearly splits into two discrete sequences , as expected from the models in the case two populations are present in the cluster .",

    "a zoom into the rgb region of ngc  121 along with the resulting fiducial line as a red dashed curve is shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : rgb ] .",
    "we then verticalized the cmd in such a way that the x - axis gives the distance of each star from the fiducial line ( delta(@xmath27 ) ) . in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : rgb ]",
    "we show the verticalized cmd . the fiducial line is indicated as a vertical red dashed line at delta(@xmath56 .",
    "the two populations are evident in the verticalized diagram . to determine the fraction of enriched stars we selected all stars with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the distribution of the selected stars in form of a histogram ( black solid line ) .",
    "the minimum of the distribution is marked with a vertical green dashed line that lies at delta(@xmath59 .",
    "we used this minimum to separate the primordial from the enriched population . by summing up the numbers of stars within the two populations",
    ", we found as a result that ngc  121 has a fraction of enriched stars of 32%@xmath13% .",
    "this faction is derived from rgb stars within 80@xmath37 from the centre , while the relative fraction of pristine vs. enriched stars possibly depends on the actual distance from the centre .",
    "we also tried to estimate the amount of enrichment of the second population from the splitting of the two sequences in the rgb . for this , we fitted a gaussian to the red sequence in the verticalized cmd using the interval @xmath60 where the two tracks are nearly parallel .",
    "we found the distance to the primordial stars to be @xmath61 = 0.17 .",
    "we then verticalized the isochrones shown in figure [ fig : isoc ] and calculated the distance of the intermediate and enriched isochrone to the primordial one in the corresponding magnitude interval . by assuming that the splitting is proportional to the amount of enrichment , we found the following level of enrichment of the second population in ngc  121 : the over - abundance in n and na is about 1.1  dex and 0.5  dex with respect to the primordial population and the level of depletion in o and c is around 0.5  dex and 0.4  dex with respect to the primordial population . of course ,",
    "these numbers are only a rough estimate and should indicate a first idea of the order of enrichment in this cluster .",
    "finally , we explore how the two populations are distributed as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centre .",
    "we created a radial cumulative fraction distribution of the pristine and the enriched ( stars coloured in blue and red in the right - hand panel in figure [ fig : rgb ] , respectively ) population .",
    "for this , we used stars that are within 2,000 pixels from the cluster centre and have pixel y - coordinates smaller than the y - coordinate of the centre of the cluster as only in this region the cluster is complete up to a radius of 2,000 pixels .",
    "we found that the two radial distributions seem to agree within the core radius . at larger radii",
    "the stars from the second population are more centrally concentrated than first population stars ( figure [ fig : cumul ] ) .",
    "a ks test gives a probability of 5.0% that the two samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "our results for the number ratio of the two populations as well as their radial distribution are in excellent agreement with what was obtained by @xcite who used a partially different data set .",
    "1 ( 403  pixels ) . ]",
    "= 0.025 , ranging from @xmath62=0.248 - 0.273 .",
    "the bottom panel shows models with a constant he value of @xmath62=0.248 . ]    the presence of multiple populations within this cluster can be inferred also from the analysis of its horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology .",
    "it is well established that together with c - n , na - o and ( sometimes ) mg - al anti - correlations , the various populations hosted by individual globular clusters display a range of initial helium abundances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a compilation of results , and references therein ) . in optical cmds ( i.e. , in photometric bands unaffected by the light - element anti - correlations ) of clusters with a red hb morphology , a range of initial helium mass fractions @xmath62 produces a wedge - shaped hb , that can not be matched by synthetic models with constant @xmath62 ( see , e.g. , the case of 47  tuc discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is precisely also the case in ngc  121 , as shown in figure  [ fig : hb ] , that displays a comparison between the observed and an synthetic hb in the @xmath63 vs @xmath64 cmd , calculated with and without a @xmath62 spread ( the displayed synthetic hbs are populated by the same number of objects as the observed hb ) .",
    "more in detail , we have calculated synthetic hb models by employing hb tracks from the basti @xmath65-enhanced stellar model library ( @xcite , and the code fully described in @xcite ) .",
    "we made use of tracks for [ fe / h]=@xmath221.31 , [ @xmath65/fe]=0.4 ( corresponding to z = 0.002 ) , and varying @xmath62 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , our calculations require to input four parameters , in addition to the cluster initial composition , age ( we take 10.5  gyr ) , and photometric error ( 1@xmath66 gaussian error taken from the mean photometric error derived for the hb stars ) .",
    "two of these parameters determine the initial @xmath62 distribution ; we considered a uniform distribution with minimum value @xmath67=0.248 and a range @xmath4 .",
    "the other two parameters are the mean value of the mass lost along the rgb , @xmath68 , and the spread around this mean value .",
    "the adopted cluster age determines the initial value of the mass of the stars evolving at the tip of the rgb ( denoted as rgb progenitor mass ) and translates @xmath68 value into actual hb masses .",
    "the two synthetic cmds displayed in figure  [ fig : hb ] have been calculated with @xmath4=0 and 0.025 , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath62 hb has @xmath68 ranging between 0.19 and 0.225  @xmath69 , with a uniform probability distribution .",
    "a mass loss range is in this case necessary to reproduce the colour extension of the observed hb .",
    "the simulation with @xmath4=0.025 has employed @xmath68=0.19 @xmath69 for each @xmath62 , with a very small gaussian 1@xmath66 spread equal to 0.005  @xmath69 .",
    "the rationale behind keeping @xmath68 constant and with a small spread at all @xmath62 is that the colour extension of the hb is driven mainly by the variation of @xmath62 rather than mass loss efficiency ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) because populations with the same age and increasing initial @xmath62 have a lower initial rgb progenitor mass , hence produce increasingly bluer hb objects when @xmath68 is kept constant 1  gyr around the reference value causes a change of the rgb progenitor mass by about @xmath10.02  @xmath69 ( lower mass for increasing age ) .",
    "synthetic hbs that match the cmd location of the observed one would then require the same hb mass distribution , but @xmath68 would vary by about @xmath10.02  @xmath69 ( decreased when the age increases ) because of the change of the rgb progenitor mass . ]    finally , in the comparison of figure  [ fig : hb ] we have employed a reddening @xmath70=0.03 as for the comparison with isochrones , and a distance modulus @xmath53=19.00 ( in good agreement with the values found by @xcite ) obtained by matching  making use of histograms of star counts as a function of @xmath2 magnitudes  the lower envelope of the observed hb with the synthetic ones .",
    "it is clear that the hb calculated with a range of @xmath62 matches the observed one better than the constant-@xmath62 hb . this latter has a horizontal lower envelope in the cmd , whereas the observed hb lower envelope gets brighter with decreasing colour , and is matched only when a range of @xmath62 is included in the simulations .",
    "the reason is very simple : as mentioned before , increasing @xmath62 at fixed age means lower rgb progenitor masses and lower hence bluer hb masses for a constant @xmath68 . given that an increase of initial @xmath62 also makes models at the start of the hb phase brighter , these two effects combined explain naturally why moving towards the blue side of the synthetic hb , the lower envelope of the stellar distribution gets increasingly brighter .",
    "we did not try to enforce a perfect statistical agreement between the theoretical and observed star counts , because this rests on the knowledge of the accurate statistical distribution of @xmath68 and @xmath62 among the cluster stars , that is at present not available .",
    "owing to the lack of theoretical and/or empirical guidance , this distribution may be extremely complicated and/or discontinuous .",
    "the qualitative constraint we have imposed on the matching synthetic hb is however sufficient to establish the presence of a range @xmath4 , hence of multiple populations also on the hb .",
    "increasing @xmath4 to 0.03 or above , or decreasing this range below 0.02 , make the synthetic hb too much , or not enough , tilted towards brighter magnitudes when moving to bluer colours , respectively .",
    "hence @xmath4 appears to be in the range between 0.02 and 0.03 , in line with the values obtained for several galactic globular clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "using a combination of three blue / ultraviolet filters we were able to detect two distinct stellar populations in the rgb of the smc cluster ngc  121 ( however , more populations might be present ) .",
    "the brighter / bluer sequence corresponds to a population with a pristine chemical abundance whereas the fainter / redder sequence is composed of chemically enriched stars .",
    "our findings are in agreement with the recent results by @xcite .",
    "they found that the rgb is broader than expected from photometric errors in the @xmath71 vs @xmath51 cmd . using a combination of the filters @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath3",
    ", they detected a splitting in the rgb , as well .",
    "we find that the fraction of the second population stars is 32% , consistent with the results from @xcite who found a fraction of enriched stars of 35% , , using the pseudo - color @xmath72 .",
    "this , however , is much smaller than the expected median value found in galactic gcs .",
    "@xcite collected a sample of 33 gcs and found that the fraction of enriched stars is never smaller than 50% with median value of 68%@xmath17% .",
    "moreover , this fraction seems to be independent of the cluster mass , metallicity or distance to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the data set presented in this study is mainly based on spectroscopic data that only probe the outer regions of the clusters .",
    "thus , the result refers to the fraction measured at larger radii .",
    "given our results , the fraction of enriched stars appears to vary from cluster to cluster , much more than reported by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the results of lardo et al .",
    "( in prep . ) who found larger variations in galactic gcs using photometric surveys .",
    "their data are based on much larger statistical samples of stars within individual clusters and also sample the inner regions of gcs .",
    "the data sets of @xcite and lardo et al .",
    "( in prep . ) therefore sample different regions of clusters with different properties and possibly varying ratios of first and second population stars .",
    "even though the relative number of enriched stars we find in ngc  121 is low , it is still in tension with scenarios that invoke strong cluster mass loss to go from initial fractions of enriched stars of @xmath85% to higher values by preferentially removing stars with primordial chemical composition .",
    "if we assume that only first population stars have been removed it follows that ngc  121 must have lost @xmath890% of its initial mass in order to get to the observed fraction of 32% enriched stars .",
    "this is , however , only a lower limit as we assume that only stars with a primordial composition have been lost .",
    "this high number , however , seems to be unlikely given the weak tidal field of the smc and the present - day mass of ngc  121 ( log(m / m@xmath7)=5.57 , @xcite ) .",
    "it is expected that the time it takes to dissolve a star cluster is longer for more massive clusters and in weaker tidal fields ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein , for a discussion ) .",
    "quite extreme assumptions have to be made for the cluster and its environment in order to allow for such high dissolution rates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such high cluster dissolution rates are also in tension with observations of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite . in contrast",
    ", @xcite showed in his model for the origin and evolution of gcs that typically , gcs could have only been , on average , at the most a factor of three more massive at birth .    additionally , we analyzed the radial distribution of the two populations .",
    "we found that up to a radius of 300 pixels ( 12@xmath37 ) , which is approximately the core radius of ngc  121 , the two populations are distributed the same . only at larger distances ,",
    "the second population stars seem to be more centrally concentrated than the primordial stars . in the self enrichment scenario",
    "where a second generation of stars forms within a cluster out of a mixture of processed stellar material and pristine gas , it would be expected that this second generation is formed in the centre of the cluster as the gas densities are highest there .",
    "a more centrally concentrated second population would be in agreement with the prediction from this scenario . other studies from the literature do not provide definitive answers regarding the relative radial distributions of populations in different clusters . using ground - based photometry or spectroscopy measurements ,",
    "the enriched populations are generally found to be more concentrated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but due to the crowding in the inner regions these studies usually avoid the central parts of the clusters .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the gc m15 using hst / wfc3 data and found that stars with primordial chemical composition are more centrally concentrated than stars with enhanced n abundances , taking also the central parts of the cluster into account .",
    "this trend , however , seems to invert at larger radii @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the radial distributions of the two populations found in the sgb and the rgb of ngc  6362 , but did not find any significant difference along the two populations across the extent of the cluster .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that the populations of the red and blue ms in the two gcs ngc  6752 and ngc  6121 ( m4 ) show no difference in their radial distributions .",
    "the results in this paper along with the findings of @xcite add the smc to the list of galaxies ( including the milky way , e.g. @xcite , the lmc , @xcite and the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy , @xcite ) harbouring a gc with multiple populations .",
    "therefore , it appears that this is a ubiquitous property of old gcs independent of environment or galaxy type .",
    "however , it is not clear yet what parameter controls whether a star cluster is able to host multiple populations .",
    "the scenarios that invoke self - enrichment and multiple episodes of star formation require the clusters to have high masses at birth in order to retain the processed stellar ejecta .",
    "as ngc  121 is relatively young , compared to milky way gcs , formation scenarios that include pop iii stars can already be ruled out . in forthcoming papers",
    "we will continue the study of a variety of massive clusters with a range of different ages and masses within the magellanic clouds aiming to constrain the parameter that is responsible for the formation of multiple populations in star clusters .    in the present work",
    ", we introduced an ongoing photometric survey using the hst searching for multiple populations in lmc / smc clusters spanning a large range of ages .",
    "we presented , as first results of this survey , the detection of two populations in the rgb of the 10.5  gyr old smc cluster ngc  121 as well as evidence of an he spread from the morphology of its hb . in the future",
