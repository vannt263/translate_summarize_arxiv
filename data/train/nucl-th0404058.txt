    "we use ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : nuomega ] ) to estimate @xmath148 @xmath209 where the total number of charged particles is @xmath210 .",
    "we take the rapidity density @xmath63 for each charge species to be uniform .",
    "the quantity @xmath211 is the value obtained for a large rapidity window .",
    "the dependence of the dynamic fluctuations @xmath212 on the relative rapidity interval @xmath213 implied by ( [ eq : rapdep ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapidity ] for several ad hoc values of @xmath203 . also shown as dashed curves are the ratios of these quantities , @xmath214 computed for @xmath205 the smaller initial width and @xmath215 the larger final width .",
    "this ratio indicates how much the fluctuations are reduced as the width increases from @xmath205 to @xmath215 . in both figures ,",
    "the change in widths are chosen so that they nearly `` hide '' initial qgp fluctuations at the level expected in ref .",

    "( [ 30 ] ) and ( [ eq : classict]).,width=307 ]    the question then becomes : are such increases in @xmath203 plausible in a diffusion model ?",
    "equation ( [ eq : widthrel ] ) implies that @xmath220 .",
    "the relevant `` formation time '' is the time at which hadronization occurs .",
    "this occurs quite late in the evolution , roughly from @xmath221 to 12  fm .",
    "freeze out occurs later , perhaps as late as @xmath222  fm .",
    "the ratio @xmath223 is then in the range from one to two , where the difference between causal and classic diffusion is substantial , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:3 ] .",
    "we take @xmath224  fm and @xmath129  fm from ref .",
    "@xcite , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ions ] .    the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : plasma ] show the decrease of dynamic fluctuations computed using ( [ eq : rat ] ) , ( [ eq : widthrel ] ) , and ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "the dashed curves are computed using ( [ 38 ] ) instead of ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "we take the value @xmath225 for the initial width ; larger values imply a smaller net reduction of @xmath212 .",
    "a hadronization time @xmath226  fm is assumed , corresponding to @xmath227 in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the gray band indicates the level to which @xmath212 must be reduced to hide the effect of plasma fluctuations .",
    "we see that classic diffusion can bring @xmath212 to this level if the system lives as long as 20  fm , while causal diffusion can not .",
    "in this paper we introduce a causal diffusion equation to describe the relativistic evolution of net charge and other conserved quantities in nuclear collisions . we find that causal limitations inhibit dissipation . to study the effect of this dissipation on fluctuation signals , we obtain a causal diffusion equation for the two - body correlation function .",
    "our approach complements the treatment in @xcite , but is more easily generalized to include radial flow and other dynamic effects for comparison to data .",
    "we then use these equations to provide estimates that show that net charge fluctuations induced by quark gluon plasma hadronization can plausibly survive diffusion in the hadronic stage .",
    "this result bolsters our optimism for fluctuation and correlation probes of hadronization and other interesting dynamics .",
    "our aim here has been to emphasize the impact of causal diffusion on charge fluctuations .",
    "correspondingly , we employ an idealized approach tailored to that aim .",
    "phenomenological conclusions require a more realistic model , to be developed elsewhere .",
    "our results on post - hadronization diffusion owe to the similarity of the lifetime of the hadronic system and the relaxation time for diffusion @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , rhic data suggests hadronic lifetimes that are as short or shorter than we assume : hbt @xcite and resonance @xcite measurements suggest a lifetime from roughly @xmath228 to @xmath229  fm . on the other hand ,",
    "our estimate of @xmath8 rests on transport calculations in ref .",
    "the importance of this problem invites further study of charge and other transport coefficients .    in closing , we briefly comment on the experimental situation .",
    "charge fluctuation measurements give roughly similar values from sps to rhic energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the star experiment finds @xmath230 at rhic @xcite .",
    "while this value is close to the benchmark hadron gas estimates @xcite , we emphasize that those estimates were constructed for an equilibrium resonance gas assuming no prior plasma stage . flow and jet quenching measurements provide strong indications  if not proof  of plasma formation @xcite .",
    "as discussed earlier , @xmath212 can be very different in a resonance gas formed from a hadronizing partonic system and , indeed , should be very close to plasma values .",
    "extraordinary charge fluctuations should be seen , but are not .",
    "it may be that net - charge fluctuations produced by plasma hadronization are closer to the benchmark hadronic estimates , as suggested by bialas @xcite .",
    "what then ?",
    "experimentally , one can turn to the centrality and azimuthal - angle dependence of fluctuations and , eventually , to correlation - function measurements as more sensitive probes of net charge fluctuations .",
    "such studies have already begun to yield important information @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can study baryon number and isospin fluctuations , which are more closely related to the qcd order parameter and , therefore , to hadronization physics and phase transition dynamics @xcite .",
