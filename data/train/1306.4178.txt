    "the space - time structure of the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , together with their polynomiality , is encoded in the matrix elements of the ( anti)commutators of the fermion fields . in this connection ,",
    "the problem of the time - ordering and the consistency of the replacement of it by the ordinary ordering in the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) is discussed in the literature since many years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the cases of the dis and dvcs processes ,",
    "it was argued the matrix element of the fermion anti - commutator vanishes and , therefore , the time - ordering in gpds is `` illusory '' and it can readily be replaced by the ordinary ordering of the corresponding fermion operators .",
    "the crucial point of those studies was that the anti - commutator contribution is defined by the limit of @xmath0 where @xmath1 at @xmath2 for the mandelstam variables differ from zero .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the support and spectral properties of the gpds emerge naturally .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that in the collinear kinematics and within the factorization procedure in the @xmath3-channel , where the mandelstam variable @xmath3 is small compared to @xmath4 , the matrix element of the fermion anti - commutator does not vanish and yields a term necessary to hold the model - independent polynomiality condition for any kind of the generalized parton distributions .",
    "moreover , the latter is even valid in the regime where the mandelstam variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 are similarly small , that is in the so - called totally collinear kinematics .",
    "note that this particular point @xmath6 in the mandelstam plane is responsible for the duality regime of the factorization , discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and bridges between the factorizations in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-channels .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of this very interesting point is forthcoming in @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrate schematically that the obtained contribution , arising from the matrix element of the fermion anti - commutator , modifies evenly another important property of the gpds , the positivity .",
    "we show , moreover , that this modification allows us to relate the gpds with the non - perturbative fermion condensates .",
    "as the first step , let us start with the outline of the main issues of the matching between the heisenberg and interaction representations . consider , for instance , the time - ordered product of two fermion fields in the interaction representation with the @xmath7-matrix , @xmath8 . using the wick theorem , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the normal - ordered product of fields .",
    "here @xmath11 stands for the sum of all possible sets of contractions ( or pairings ) between the fields excluding the terms with _ all _ fields contracted , the latter being accumulated in @xmath12 .",
    "the field @xmath13 in the interaction representation transforms into the heisenberg field operator @xmath14 as follows @xmath15 . by making use of this transformation ,",
    "we obtain the relation between the time - ordered products of two fermion fields in the heisenberg and in the interaction representations , respectively : @xmath16 calculating the vacuum expectation value of the time - ordered operator product , we get the standard definition of the connected green function : @xmath17 where the normalization condition @xmath18 cancels all contributions from the disconnected graphs in the interaction representation , while the vacuum state in the heisenberg picture is defined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in what follows we shall only keep the up - script @xmath21 in formulae to indicate the heisenberg representation .    if we consider now the hadronic matrix element of the time - ordered operator product instead of the vacuum average , we observe ( upon application of the wick theorem ) that the terms related to the matrix elements of the normal - ordered operators _ do not disappear_. notice that the same inference is true if our states are the physical or non - perturbative vacuum . at the same time",
    ", the fully - contracted terms refer to the disconnected matrix elements and , therefore , have to be discarded .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the corresponding product of different propagators . the first term in the _ l.h.s .",
    "_ of ( [ hadmes ] ) , @xmath24 , which is proportional to @xmath25 , describes only the disconnected feynman diagrams .",
    "thus , we define the connected matrix element of the time - ordered operator product as @xmath26 where the subscript @xmath27 points out that we are dealing with the connected matrix elements . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadron matrix element ( [ hadmescon ] ) can be written in compact form in the heisenberg representation .",
    "we have @xmath28 or , comparing eq .",
    "( [ hadmescon ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ hadmeheiscon ] ) , we conclude that @xmath29 in turn , given that we consider only the connected matrix elements , the normal - ordered operators in the heisenberg representation can be replaced by the time - ordered operators @xmath30 let us emphasize that eqs .",
    "( [ mathai ] ) and ( [ mathai2 ] ) are our principal observations , to which we would like to attract attention of the reader .",
    "now we concentrate on the dvcs amplitude factorized into the hard and the soft parts .",
    "before the factorization is carried out , the dvcs amplitude in the interaction picture can be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electromagnetic current and the @xmath7-matrix involve all possible interactions . expanding the @xmath7-matrix in power of the coupling constant ( we do not need yet to specify the lagrangians we are working with ) and making use of the wick theorem , we obtain the standard expression for the amplitude @xmath33 where the ellipsis denotes other possible combinations of the normal - ordered operators including the cross - terms .",
    "we here underlined the combination to stress that it will form the hard part of the amplitude .",
    "notice that the combinations with @xmath34 normal - ordered operators are not the issues in the present paper .",
    "the factorization of the amplitude in the interaction representation consists in the separation the hard part ( underlined ) from the soft part ( which will be expressed in what follows in terms of the gpds ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 suggests that we have to hold only two fermion operators as the normal - ordered one .",
    "the spinors should be understood as the operators with the free dirac indices . as it has been mentioned above",
    ", the heisenberg representation allows us to re - write the _",
    "( [ gpds1 ] ) in the most compact form as @xmath37 given that we are again interested in the connected matrix elements only , we may write the time - ordered operators instead of the normal - ordered operators in the heisenberg representation , _ i.e. _ @xmath38 alternatively , using the light - cone notations , one has @xmath39 these three representations , eqs .",
    "( [ gpds2])-([gpds4 ] ) , are equivalent .",
    "recall that the function @xmath40 possesses the free dirac indices .",
    "if we now project the gpds ( [ gpds2])-([gpds4 ] ) to the @xmath41-matrix , we shall obtain the various twist-@xmath42 generalized parton distributions , depending on the hadron target : @xmath43}\\stackrel{{\\rm def}}{=}{\\rm tr } [ \\gamma^+\\,\\phi ] \\rightarrow \\ { h_1 ; h , e ; ... \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can thus conclude that since we deal only with the connected matrix elements , the time - ordering and/or the normal - ordering occur in the gpds of any kind in an equivalent way .",
    "this is one of our main observations .",
    "let us now focus on eq .",
    "( [ gpds3 ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that the time - ordered combination of spinors can be expressed through their commutator and anti - commutator : @xmath44}(x ) +   \\phi^{\\{ ... \\}}(x ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45}(x)=\\frac{1}{2 } \\int d^4k \\ , \\delta(x - k.n)\\ , d^4z e^{i(k-\\delta/2).z}\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\langle p_2| [ \\bar\\psi(0 ) , \\psi(z)]|p_1 \\rangle^h_c\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath46 we would like to emphasize that the presence of @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ phianticom ] ) leads to the absence of any @xmath48-channel cuts in the anti - commutator contribution , while the commutator contribution can be related to the @xmath48-channel cuts .",
    "indeed , consider the first term of the anti - commutator contribution , see eq .",
    "( [ phianticom ] ) : @xmath49 inserting of the full set and making use of the translation invariance , one presents this expression in the following form : @xmath50 one can see that the four - dimensional @xmath51-function , needed for the appearance of the cut in @xmath52-channel , is absent .",
    "the similar is valid for the second term of eq .",
    "( [ phianticom ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that if the anti - commutator were vanishing for some reason ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it would be permitted to replace the time - ordering by the ordinary product of operators .",
    "that is to say , the time - ordering gets `` illusory '' .    however , we here present an alternative approach to show that the contribution of the anti - commutator , @xmath53 , does not vanish in the case of factorization in the @xmath3-channel , using the collinear kinematics ( see below ) , where the mandelstam variable @xmath3 is small compared to @xmath4",
    ". one of our main evidences is that the contribution of the anti - commutator matrix element is necessary to obey the model - independent _ polynomiality condition _ for the gpds , which arises from the requirement of the lorentz covariance of the corresponding matrix element .",
    "we will demonstrate this by taking as an example the box diagram within a toy model which was very useful to the introduction of gpds @xcite .",
    "consider first the box diagram contribution to the dvcs amplitude : @xmath54 in perturbation theory .",
    "the box diagram is the most illustrative object to reveal the main features of the factorization approach involving the gpds , see @xcite .",
    "because the factorization procedure is extensively described in the literature , we will skip the details of this procedure .",
    "we begin with the definition of the light - cone kinematics , which we will use in what follows : @xmath55 without the loss of generality , we may use the _ collinear _ kinematics which corresponds to the case when @xmath56 .",
