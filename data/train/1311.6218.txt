    "asteroseismology has proved to be a powerful tool for determining the fundamental parameters of stars , probing the internal structure of stars , and diagnosing physical processes in stellar interiors @xcite .",
    "stars with masses between about 1.1 and 1.5 have a convective core during their main sequence ( ms ) . at the same time , however , solar - like oscillations may be present in such stars , with a convective core increasing in size during the initial stage of the ms of these stars before the core begins to shrink .",
    "the presence of the convective core brings to the fore the question of the mixing of elements in the stellar interior caused by the core s overshooting , which prolongs the lifetime of the burning of core hydrogen by feeding more h - rich material into the core . in the current theory of stellar evolution ,",
    "the overshooting of the convective core is generally described by a free parameter .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the mass and extension of the convective core due to overshooting directly affects the determination of the global parameters of the stars by asteroseismology or other studies based on stellar evolution @xcite . especially for stars with a mass of around 1.1 , there may or may not exist a convective core in their interior , depending on the input physics used in the computation of their evolutions @xcite . thus determining the presence of the convective core and its extension is important for understanding the structure and evolution of stars .",
    "there is no a direct method to determine the size of a convective core or the extension of overshooting .",
    "fortunately , however , the low-@xmath8 p - modes can penetrate into the innermost layers of stars , which offers an opportunity to probe the convective core . determining the size and extension of a convective core by means of asteroseismology",
    "was first studied by @xcite .",
    "however , for most of solar - like oscillating stars , the uncertainty of the frequencies of modes with @xmath9 and @xmath10 is generally larger than that of modes with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; and the frequencies of modes with @xmath13 are usually not extracted .",
    "thus it is difficult to obtain the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 defined by @xcite or the expression suggested by @xcite .",
    "the small spacings @xmath16 and @xmath17 defined by @xcite and @xcite can be used to diagnose the convective core of stars . in calculation ,",
    "equations ( [ d10o ] ) and ( [ d01o ] ) are generally rewritten as the smoother five - point separations @xcite . by using this tool",
    ", @xcite studied the solar - like pulsator hd 203608 .",
    "they found that the presence or absence of a convective core in stars can be indicated by the small spacings and that the star hd 203608 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 gyr in fact has a convective core .",
    "for their part , @xcite found that the slope of @xmath20 relates to the size of the jump in the sound speed at the edge of the convective core .",
    "@xcite studied the oscillations of @xmath21 centauri a ( @xmath22 ) and concluded that the @xmath20 allows one to set an upper limit to the amount of convective - core overshooting and that the model of @xmath21 centauri a with a radiative core reproduces the observed @xmath23 ( @xmath1 ) significantly better than the model with a convective core .",
    "furthermore , @xcite analyzed the sensitivity of @xmath1 to the central conditions of stars during the ms evolution .",
    "they claimed that the presence of a convective core can be detected by @xmath1 . using this asteroseismic tool",
    ", @xcite tried to detect the convective core of perky ( kic 6106415 ) and dushera ( kic 12009504 ) .",
    "they found that the mass of perky is @xmath24 and that of dushera is @xmath25 , and concluded that a convective core and core overshooting exist in dushera , but could not determine whether a convective core exists in perky .",
    "@xcite noted , moreover , that the frequency ratios @xmath1 and @xmath0 of perky and dushera have a sudden increase at high frequencies .",
    "they argued that this behavior results from the low signal - to - noise ratio and the larger line width at the high - frequency end and is not predicted by models .",
    "thus they did not consider the frequency ratios on this regime in comparison with stellar models .",
    "if this behavior derives from the stellar interior structure and can be predicted by stellar models and pulsation theory , stellar models can be more strictly constrained by the ratios .",
    "the frequencies of p - modes of dozens of ms stars have been extracted @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of p - modes of hd 49933 , which is an f5v ms star , have been determined by many authors @xcite .",
    "combing asteroseismical and non - asteroseismical data , several authors @xcite have investigated various properties of hd 49933 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the effect of rotation on hd 49933 is very weak , but that the diffusion of elements is important .",
    "@xcite concluded that the overshooting of the convective core is needed , but that the microscopic diffusion may be unimportant .",
    "it seems to be difficult to reach a consensus about the mass of hd 49933 .",
    "the mass determined by @xcite is about 1.17 ; by @xcite 1.1 - 1.2 ; by @xcite 1.19 @xmath26 0.08 ; by @xcite similarly 1.20 @xmath26 0.08 ; but by @xcite about 1.32 .",
    "the difference in mass determinations may result from whether consideration is given to the effects of core overshooting or microscopic diffusion .",
    "in any case , depending on the difference of mass , differences in other parameters obtained by these authors obviously exist .",
    "because hd 49933 may be more massive than hd 203608 , @xmath21 cen a , perky , and dushera , it could have a convective core .",
    "moreover , the increase in frequency ratios @xmath1 and @xmath0 at high frequencies also exists in it , making it a good target for determining the size of a convective core by means of asteroseismology and for studying the effects of a convective core on frequency ratios . furthermore , there are the frequency shifts of its low - degree p - modes @xcite , which are understood arising from the effect of magnetic activity just as that found in the sun .",
    "hence , to determine the accurate stellar parameters of hd 49933 can be significant for understanding the structure and evolution of stars .",
    "in present work , we focus mainly on determining accurate stellar parameters of hd 49933 and examining whether the increase in the frequency ratios at high frequencies can be predicted by pulsation theory and stellar models . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce our stellar models and perform a classical asteroseismic analysis . in section 3 , we show the calculated results ; and in section 4 , we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "the luminosity of hd 49933 is 3.58 @xmath26 0.1 @xcite , and its radius is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "its effective temperature is between about 6467 and 6780 k @xcite .",
    "combining other data , we took an average effective temperature : @xmath28 k. hd 49933 is a slightly metal - poor star with [ fe / h ] between about -0.2 and -0.5 @xcite .",
    "for population i stars , the ratio of surface heavy - element abundance to hydrogen abundance is related to the fe / h by [ fe / h ] @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the ratio of the solar mixture .",
    "the most recent ratio of the heavy - element abundance to hydrogen abundance of the sun , @xmath30 , is 0.0171 @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some discrepancies between the solar model constructed according to this new value and seismical results @xcite .",
    "the old value of @xmath30 is 0.023 @xcite , which is in good agreement with the seismical results .",
    "the range of @xmath31 for hd 49933 can be considered to be approximately between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 . considering the controversy about the value of @xmath30 , the value of @xmath31 in our calculations is used as a reference , but not applied to constraining stellar models .    in order to reproduce observed characteristics of hd 49933",
    ", we computed a grid of evolutionary tracks using the yale rotation evolution code @xcite .",
    "the opal eos tables @xcite , opal opacity tables @xcite , and the opacity tables for low temperature provided by @xcite were used .",
    "energy transfer by convection is treated according to the standard mixing length theory .",
    "the diffusion of both helium and heavy elements is computed by using the diffusion coefficients of @xcite . with the constraints mentioned above",
    ", we obtained hundreds of evolutionary tracks for hd 49933 .",
    "the initial parameters of these tracks are summarized in table [ para1 ] .",
    "the low - degree p - modes of hd 49933 were first identified by @xcite and @xcite . using longer corot @xcite timeseries data of hd 49933",
    ", @xcite extracted the frequencies of the low - degree p - modes with less uncertainty .",
    "nonetheless , the frequencies of the modes with @xmath9 still have a large error ( @xmath35 @xmath36hz ) due to the fact that these modes overlap with the @xmath11 modes and that the rotational splitting is relatively large for hd 49933 @xcite . here",
    "we thus only used the frequencies of the modes with @xmath37 and @xmath12 to constrain our stellar models . for each observed frequency , we took the maximum error listed by @xcite at @xmath38 .",
    "the average large frequency separation @xmath39 of these modes is @xmath40 @xmath36hz .    in order to find the set of modeling parameters ( @xmath41 , , @xmath42 ) that leads to the best agreement with the observational constraints",
    ", we computed the value of @xmath43 of models on the grid .",
    "the function @xmath43 is defined as follows @xmath44 where the quantity @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the observed and model values of , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath39 , respectively . the observational uncertainty is indicated by @xmath49 .",
    "we obtained more than fifty tracks which are shown in figure [ fhrd1 ] .",
    "the parameters of the models on these tracks can meet @xmath50 .",
    "then we computed the frequencies of low - degree p - modes of the models on these tracks using the guenther adiabatic pulsation code @xcite , and we calculated the value of @xmath51 of each model .",
    "the function @xmath51 is defined as follows @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the observed and corresponding model eigenfrequencies of the @xmath55th mode , respectively , and @xmath56 is the observational uncertainty of the @xmath55th mode .    in order to ensure that the model with the minimum @xmath51 is picked out as a suitable candidate , the time - step of the evolution for each track is set as small as possible when the model evolves to the vicinity of the error - box of luminosity and effective temperature in the h - r diagram .",
    "this makes the consecutive models have an approximately equal @xmath51 . as a result",
    ", we obtained more than 50 models which are listed in tables [ tmod1 ] and [ tmod2 ] , classified according to whether the diffusion of elements is considered or not .",
    "their positions in the h - r diagram are shown in figure [ fhrd2 ] .",
    "for the diffusion or non - diffusion models with a given , the model with a minimum @xmath51 is chosen as the candidate that best fits the model .",
    "we thus obtained four models ( m07 , m14 , m18 , and m26 ) in which element diffusion is not considered and four other models ( m30 , m35 , m40 , and m48 ) in which it is considered .",
    "the echelle diagrams of these models are shown in figures [ fec1 ] and [ fec2 ] .",
    "tables [ tmod1 ] and [ tmod2 ] show that the values of @xmath51 of the models m07 , m14 , m18 , and m26 are generally smaller than those of m30 , m35 , m40 , and m48 . by comparing individual theoretical frequencies to the observed ones , the method of the @xmath51 minimization seems to indicate that model m26 is the one best fit for hd 49933 because it has the minimum @xmath51 .",
    "the echelle diagram of model m26 is also slightly better than those of other models .",
    "this seems to suggest that the overshooting of the convective core is needed for hd 49933 , but that the microscopic diffusion may be unimportant .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mass of m26 is 1.20 which is also in agreement with the value of @xmath57 determined by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have pointed out that the most fitting model as found solely by matching individual frequencies of oscillations does not always properly reproduce the ratios @xmath1 and @xmath0 , i.e. , the interior structure of the `` best - fit model '' may not match the interior structure of the star .",
    "there is a well - known near - surface effect in heliosismology .",
    "a similar effect must occur as well in asteroseismology @xcite , which could affect results when one compares theoretical individual frequencies to observed ones .",
    "an empirical formula was proposed by @xcite to correct the near - surface effect for models of solar - like stars .",
    "when we calculated the values of @xmath51 listed in tables [ tmod1 ] and [ tmod2 ] , such a correction was not taken into account .    in order to understand the effect of the surface correction on *",
    "all computed * models , we calculated * the chi squared after frequency correction ( @xmath58 ) * , using equations ( 6 ) and ( 2 ) of @xcite . * for a given , the surface correction does not change the  best candidate \" ( see table [ tmod1 ] and [ tmod2 ] ) .",
    "however in overall and for models without diffusion , while a model with a 0.2 overshoot was favored ( m14 ) , a model with no overshoot is now favored ( m07 ) .",
    "nonetheless , according to the theory of @xcite , one should also account of the correction factor @xmath59 to define the best model .",
    "the closer a reference model is to the best one , the closer to @xmath12 is @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the uncorrected and corrected chi squared must be the same and small .",
    "the value of the correction factor @xmath59 is @xmath60 for m14 , which among all our models , is the closest to one . for models with diffusion ,",
    "we favor m48 because of its @xmath58 and because @xmath61 .",
    "we therefore conclude that m14 and m48 are the best models that fit the observations . *",
    "we calculated the ratios @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the observed and theoretical frequencies .",
    "figure [ fd011 ] shows that the observed @xmath1 and @xmath0 decrease with a frequency in the approximate range between about 1300 and 2050 @xmath36hz ( hereafter labeled  decrease range \" ) , but they increase with a frequency in the range between about 2050 and 2400 @xmath36hz ( labeled  increase range \" ) .",
    "the model m14 can not reproduce the observed ratios @xmath1 and @xmath0 . however , models m26 , m40 , and m48 reproduce well the ratios in the decrease range .",
    "the same ratios of models m26 and m40 decrease in the increase range , which is inconsistent with the observed results ; but those of model m48 increase slightly in the range between about 2100 and 2500 @xmath36hz . although the ratios of m48 can not reproduce the increase at high frequencies , the trend of increase is consistent with the behavior of the observed ratios .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fd011 ] shows that the observed @xmath1 is slightly larger than @xmath0 in the decrease range , but smaller in the increase range",
    ". the ratios of m48 exhibit the same characteristics .    models",
    "m26 and m48 have a large .",
    "the increase behavior of the frequency ratios at high frequencies might be related to the convective core , which can be significantly affected by overshooting parameter .",
    "thus we constructed four models with a larger , i.e. m51 , m52 , m53 , and m54 .",
    "these reproduce not only the ratios in the decrease range , but also the increase behavior of the ratios at high frequencies ( see figure [ fd012 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath1 of these models is larger than their @xmath0 at low frequencies , but smaller at high frequencies .",
    "the increase in the ratios @xmath1 and @xmath0 for these models is more obvious at high frequencies .",
    "the behavior of the increase could derive from the interior structure of stars .        in order to better understand whether the increase behavior results from the structure of stars or not , we analyze the characteristics of the ratios by making use of the asymptotic formula of frequencies .",

    "\\label{av0}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath83 decreases monotonically with the increase in frequencies .",
    "thus , the sudden change in the ratios could result from the change in @xmath84 .",
    "the radial distributions of the adiabatic sound speed and the quantity @xmath84 of different models are shown in figure [ fcr ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 increases with the decrease in radius and depends mainly on the conditions in the stellar core . according to equation ( [ rt ] ) , the higher the frequencies , the smaller the @xmath68 for modes with a given @xmath8 . thus the quantity @xmath84 increases with increasing frequencies . when the decrease of @xmath85 can not counteract the increase of @xmath84 , the ratio @xmath0 would increase with increasing frequencies .",
    "moreover , if changes in the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 are dominated mainly by the changes of @xmath85 and ( @xmath86 ) respectively , equations ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ r01 ] ) show that the ratios decrease with increasing frequencies and that @xmath1 can be slightly larger than @xmath0 because @xmath87 .",
    "this case happens at low frequencies because the lower the frequency , the larger the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath88 .",
    "however , if the changes in the ratios are mainly dominated by the changes of @xmath84 and the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath88 can be neglected , the ratios increase with the increase in @xmath84 , and @xmath1 would be slightly smaller than @xmath0 because the @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath89 is smaller than that corresponding to @xmath90 .",
    "this case occurs at high frequencies because the higher the frequency , the smaller the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath88 .",
    "these characteristics are similar to those of the ratios of the observed frequencies and the adiabatic oscillation frequencies of models m48 , m51 , m52 , m53 , and m54 .",
    "thus an increase could exist in the ratios of p - mode frequencies of a star , and it could be seen within the observed frequency range of the star , provided that the slope change is close to the frequencies of the maximum seismical amplitude ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "figure [ fcr ] shows that the quantity @xmath84 varies significantly with the stellar radius in the convective core , which may lead to the possibility that the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 increase with increasing frequencies . by making use of asymptotic formulas ( [ rt ] ) and ( [ r10 ] ) , our calculations show that the ratios of m07 exhibit an insignificant increase at high frequencies [ see the dotted ( blue ) line in the panel m07 of figure [ fr104 ] ] , which shows that the increase in ratios can be predicted by the asymptotic formulas despite the fact that the increase can not match the observed one .",
    "however , the ratio of the adiabatic oscillation frequencies of m07 ( the green dash - dotted line ) does not exhibit a similar behavior .",
    "the value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 computed using the asymptotic formulas ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ r01 ] ) strongly depend on the equation ( [ rt ] ) , which is obtained from the dispersion relation of p - modes .",
    "the dispersion relation is deduced from adiabatic oscillation equations with the conditions of cowling approximation and local ( constant coefficient ) approximation @xcite . for stars with a convective core",
    ", there is a large gradient of chemical composition @xmath92 at the top of the core ( see figure [ fhy ] ) , which leads to a sudden increase in the squared brunt - v@xmath93is@xmath93l@xmath93 frequency @xmath94 .",
    "this results in the fact that the coefficient \\{@xmath95 $ ] } of the adiabatic oscillation equations [ ( 15.5 ) and ( 15.6 ) in @xcite ] strongly depends on radius @xmath96 in this region ; i.e. the coefficients should not be assumed to be constant .",
    "thus relation ( [ rt ] ) should be modified . moreover",
    ", the large @xmath92 might hinder the fact that p - modes transmit in the stellar interior .",
    "in other words , the equation ( [ rt ] ) might underestimate the value of the turning point @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , we modify relation ( [ rt ] ) as @xmath97 where the parameter @xmath98 is larger than one . for a given mode ,",
    "the position of the turning point determined by equation ( [ rt ] ) is deeper than that predicted by equation ( [ rtm ] ) . thus the frequency ratios computed by equations ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ rt ] ) are larger than those calculated by equations ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ rtm ] ) .",

    "unfortunately , the ratio @xmath0 determined by formulas ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ rtm ] ) does not reproduce directly the observed increase behavior .",
    "in a convective region , there is no gradient of chemical composition ; so the turning point should be determined by equation ( [ rt ] ) .",
    "due to the fact that the quantity @xmath84 is mainly dependent on the conditions in stellar interiors , we assume that the turning point of the modes propagating out of the convective core is determined by equation ( [ rtm ] ) despite the fact that there is no chemical gradient in the outer layers of the radiative region , but that the turning point of the modes penetrated the convective core is determined by equation ( [ rt ] ) . these assumptions can result in two inferences .",
    "one is that the frequency ratios can increase suddenly near the frequencies whose corresponding turning points are located at the boundary of the convective core .",
    "the other is that the magnitude of the increase is equal to the difference between the ratios determined by equations ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ rt ] ) and those determined by equations ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ rtm ] ) at the boundary of the convective core .    for model m48 , according to formula ( [ rtm ] ) , the turning point of the modes of about 2100 @xmath36hz is located at the boundary of the convective core . for the modes with frequencies larger than 2100 @xmath36hz , their turning points should be determined by equation ( [ rt ] ) in the convective core .",
    "the value of @xmath0 determined by formulas ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ rt ] ) is about 0.0494 at around 2100 @xmath36hz , while that determined by formulas ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ rtm ] ) is about 0.0323 for the frequency just less than 2100 @xmath36hz .",
    "the difference between these two values is about 0.017 , which is compatible with the value of 0.019 of the increase of the observed @xmath0 at around 2100 @xmath36hz .",
    "a sudden change in the turning point of the consecutive @xmath90 seems unreasonable .",
    "thus we assume that the overshooting region is a transition region between the radiative region and the convective core as determined by schwarzschild criteria ; that is to say , the value of @xmath98 changes from 2.0 to 1.0 in the overshooting region .",
    "the ratios @xmath0 computed according to this assumption are shown by the long - dashed ( magenta ) lines in figure [ fr104 ] .",
    "the magnitude of the increase of the @xmath0 between about 2050 and 2250 @xmath36hz is about 0.015 for m48 , which is slightly lower than the observed value of 0.019 . for m52 ,",
    "when the overshooting region is treated as a transition region , the magnitude of the increase in the @xmath0 between 1950 and 2150 @xmath36hz is also about 0.015 .",
    "there exists a gradient of the mean molecular weight in the interior of the sun despite the fact that it is less than the gradient in stars with a convective core .",
    "thus the calibrated equation ( [ rtm ] ) can be tested by the solar model and solar oscillation frequencies .",

    "@xcite argued that the slope of the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 depends simultaneously on the central hydrogen content * ( @xmath101 ) * , the extent of the convective core , and the amplitude of the sound - speed discontinuity at the core boundary . @xcite also concluded that the relation between the slope of @xmath20 and the size of the jump in the sound speed at the edge of the convective core is linear . in our models , however , the slope seems not to depend directly on the central hydrogen content , the extent of the convective core , or the size of the jump in the sound speed .",
    "model m26 has almost the steepest ratios in the observable range of frequencies ( see figure [ fr104 ] ) .",
    "however , its central hydrogen content and the size of its convective core are larger than those of model m07 , though less than those of m48 . at the same time",
    "the amplitude of the sound - speed discontinuity at the core boundary ( see figure [ fcr ] ) is less than that of m07 , but larger than that of m48 .    according to equation ( [ r10 ] ) , due to the fact that @xmath85 decreases with increasing frequencies ,",
    "the slope of ratio @xmath0 is mainly affected by @xmath84 .",
    "if a mode did not arrive at the convective core , its @xmath84 could not be affected by that core .",
    "according to equation ( [ rtm ] ) , the value of @xmath84 is about 28.7 @xmath36hz at 1300 @xmath36hz for models m07 and m26 ; but that value is about 40.7 @xmath36hz at 2400 @xmath36hz , whose corresponding turning point is located in the radiative region for m07 .",
    "thus the @xmath0 of model m07 only slightly decreases with the increase in frequencies and is not affected by the jump in the sound speed at the core boundary . for model m26 , the value is 32.6 @xmath36hz at 2300 @xmath36hz , whose corresponding turning point is located just at the core boundary ; in this case the jump in the sound speed at the core boundary affects the slope of @xmath0 of adiabatic frequencies .",
    "the overshooting region is treated as a transition area between the radiative region and the convective core , which means that the mixing should not be a complete process in the overshooting region .",
    "this is consistent with the result that overshooting mixing should be regarded as a weak mixing process in stars @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 obtained from the asymptotic formula has a shift , compared to the distributions of the observed @xmath0 ( see figure [ fr104 ] ) .",
    "this may suggest that there are some discrepancies between our models and hd 49933 .    moreover , the uncertainty of the observed ratios is relatively large at high frequencies , which is mainly due to the uncertainty of the @xmath11 modes .",
    "considering the large uncertainty , the increase of the ratios is not very significant .",
    "this may affect our interpretation on hd 49933 .    in our calculations",
    ", only the models with a large convective core can reproduce the increase in the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for these models , the value of is around 0.6 , which is larger than the generally accepted value .",
    "this may be why the behavior can not be predicted by the models of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the surface rotation period of hd 49933 is about 3.4 days @xcite , which is obviously lower than the approximately 27 days of the sun .",
    "rotation can lead to an increase in the convective core , which depends on the rotational mixing and rotation rate @xcite .",
    "thus , the large core might be related to the rotation .",
    "in addition , the low - mass stars with mass more massive than about 1.25 have a shallow convective zone .",
    "their angular momentum loss rate could be either lower than that of the sun or neglected @xcite .",
    "the rotation rate of such stars can obviously be higher than that of the sun .",
    "the high rotation rate of hd 49933 , therefore , suggests that its mass might be greater than 1.25 .      in this work",
    ", we constructed a series of models for hd49933 .",
    "the increase behavior in the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 at high frequencies is not only reproduced by our models , but also predicted by the asymptotic formulas of the ratios .",
    "the increase in the ratios could exist for stars with a large convective core and derive from the fact that the gradient of chemical compositions at the bottom of the radiative region hinders the propagation of p - modes , while such a hindrance does not exist in the convective core .",
    "the asymptotic formulas of the ratios calibrated to hd 49933 reproduce well the solar ratios between about 1500 and 4000 @xmath36hz . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the behavior of the ratios obtained from the frequencies of @xcite is contrary to that obtained from the data of @xcite ; at the same time , the observed ratios can not be reproduced by theoretical ratios",
    ".    when the characteristic of the increase in the ratios is neglected , the observational constraints point to a star with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 gyr , @xmath105 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for hd 49933 , where the uncertainties * correspond to the maximum / minimum values reached by the model parameters , for @xmath38 departures from the most probable value of the observational constraints .",
    "* however , when that characteristic is used to constrain stellar models , the observational constraints favor a star with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 gyr , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the characteristic of the increase in the ratios provides a strict constraint on stellar models and could be applied to determining the extent of overshooting and the size of the convective core .",
    "moreover , in order to reproduce the characteristic of the increase in the ratios of hd 49933 , the diffusion of chemical elements and the core overshooting are required . however ,",
    "if the frequency ratios at high frequencies are not considered when compared to stellar models , the effect of element diffusion can be neglected when computing the models .",
