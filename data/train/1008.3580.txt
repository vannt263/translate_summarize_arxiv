    "the dynamics of a classical or a quantum field drastically depends on the external boundary conditions imposed on it .",
    "these boundary conditions lead to a modification of its power spectrum with consequences on measurable quantities like the radiation pressure .",
    "one of the most notable examples of this kind of phenomena is the casimir effect @xcite : in its original formulation the change in the spectral density of zero - point fluctuations of the quantum electromagnetic field induced by the presence of two perfectly reflecting parallel plates turns into a net radiation pressure that pushes one plate towards the other or , in other words , into an attractive force between the plates .",
    "recently , thanks to technological advancements , we have witnessed an increased interest in casimir interactions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the casimir force offers new possibilities for nanotechnology , such as actuation in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems ( mems and nems ) mediated by the quantum vacuum .",
    "however , it also presents some challenges since the same force is generally recognized as one of the possible sources of stiction and consequently of malfunctioning of these devices .",
    "researchers have therefore started an intense theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite program in order put some theoretical constraints @xcite and to understand how to engineer the strength and possibly also the sign of the casimir force - a repulsive casimir force would provide an anti-stiction \" effect .",
    "inevitably a lot of attention has been focused on the role of the boundary conditions and very recently on the interplay of material properties , temperature , and geometry .    in this paper",
    "we present our results for the computation of finite temperature casimir forces between periodic nanostructures using a modal approach .",
    "our calculation is based on the scattering approach to the casimir effect which gives the casimir force between two objects starting from their scattering properties . in our case",
    "this reduces the problem to the calculation of the reflection matrices of the periodic nanostructures .",
    "we will pay particular attention to 2d lamellar gratings , which are periodic metallic and/or dielectric structures that consist of planar layers .",
    "many complex 3d structures , such as photonic crystals and metamaterials , can be thought of as being constructed from individual 2d extruded metallic and dielectric strata @xcite .",
    "the problem of the reflection of an electromagnetic field impinging on a periodic structure is a topic that has a huge literature , and there are a large variety of methods to efficiently compute the reflected and transmitted electromagnetic power from such a surface ( for a review see , for example , @xcite ) . among the most famous methods one finds the differential approach @xcite , the integral approach @xcite , and the modal approach @xcite .",
    "our numerical results are based on the last technique that , for its characteristic of simplicity , flexibility , and stability lends itself to be the most adequate to our purpose .",
    "( see @xcite for a review of several numerical techniques specifically adapted to the computation of casimir forces . )    while other more general numerical scattering techniques exist , the modal expansion of the electromagnetic field provides insight into the anatomy of the casimir force .",
    "this microscopic analysis provides an understanding of the nature of the electromagnetic fluctuations that give rise to the casimir force and a means to modify their contribution to the casimir force @xcite .",
    "these dominant eigenmode and frequency contributions to the casimir force can be identified within the modal expansion and their influence under perturbation of the permittivity of the structure explored .",
    "our modal expansion , based on a planewave expansion of the fields and a fourier decomposition of the permittivity of the structure , is limited to periodic structures but is the natural choice to examine the casimir force in lamellar structures like photonic crystals and metamaterials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ casimir ]",
    "we briefly review the calculation of the casimir interaction free energy and force at finite temperatures within the scattering approach , and we specialize the general formula to periodic structures . in section [ modal ]",
    "we describe the modal approach and its application to generic ( non - lamellar ) periodic structures .",
    "our finite - temperature numerical code is then benchmarked in section [ results ] against experimental data for the casimir interaction between a metallic sphere and a doped si 1d lamellar grating @xcite .",
    "related zero - temperature computations using the differential approach have been performed in @xcite for dielectric 1d lamellar gratings , and in @xcite for metallic 1d sinusoidal gratings .",
    "we also compute casimir forces in two - dimensional structures consisting of 2d array of silicon pillars , or a 2d array of square holes ( the complementary structure to the array of pillars ) . in the last section",
    "we discuss our results and prospects for future studies .",
    "in the last few years several authors have developed many powerful ( semi)analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite approaches to calculate casimir forces .",
    "they allow for the treatment of quite general geometric and material setups going beyond the simple plane - plane geometry of casimir s seminal calculation . for our purposes , the scattering approach",
    "@xcite is the most convenient formulation .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that it exclusively relies on knowledge of the reflection properties of the objects seen as isolated scatterers for the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "indeed , for linear magneto - dielectric media , i.e. media that are completely characterized by permittivity @xmath0 and permeability @xmath1 tensors , virtual and real photons are treated at the same level @xcite , so that vacuum fluctuations are scattered in the same way as real fields .",

    "most of the time the suitable basis for @xmath14 is completely different from the one for @xmath15 . in such circumstances other matrices representing the change of bases",

    "( [ fig : gratings ] ) .",
    "the periods of the gratings are assumed to be the same for simplicity ( for gratings with non - equal but commensurable periods the technique we are about to describe uses the minimum common period for the two gratings ) .",
    "the medium in between is assumed to be homogeneous ( it will become evident in the following that this condition can be easily relaxed ) . both structures lie in the @xmath16 plane of a orthonormal cartesian coordinate system .",
    "the @xmath17 coordinate is called longitudinal because it is normal to both grating surfaces .",
    "the choice of a rectangular basis is not mandatory but dictated by symmetry , and it has been shown that sometimes the introduction of a nonrectangular coordinate system can improve the numerical convergence @xcite .    as usual for periodic system @xcite , it is convenient to introduce the transverse reciprocal space basis @xmath18 associated with the reciprocal lattice described by the two dimensional vector @xmath19 where we have implicitly defined @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the periods of the grating along the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions , respectively .",

    "the transverse wavevector @xmath30 is constrained by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which define the domain @xmath33 known as the first brillouin zone @xcite of the reciprocal lattice ( @xmath34 ) , the other brillouin zones are defined by @xmath35 .",

    "the two coordinate basis are indeed connected by a transformation which is equivalent to a three dimensional fourier series and we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the basis is also orthonormal .",
    "all operators in can now be represented as ( infinite ) matrices . due to the periodicity and the symmetry ,",

    "we will see in the next section that these quantities correspond to the ( rayleigh ) reflection coefficients associated with the scattering of the electromagnetic field from an isolated grating .",
    "several well developed theoretical and computational techniques exist for the evaluation of scattering from periodic structures @xcite .",
    "one class of scattering techniques makes use of the planewave expansion for the electromagnetic fields in the spirit of the derivation of the previous section .",

    "the characteristic equation for the eigenvalues is an equation of an even order with @xmath105 solutions : if @xmath94 is a solution then @xmath106 is also a solution , so that half of the eigenvalues and half of the eigenvectors can be obtained by simple conjugation .",

    "note that the rayleigh basis defined in section [ casimir ] for the cavity is a particular ( homogeneous medium / no modulation ) case of the modal solution described above , and the eigenvalues coincide with the longitudinal vector @xmath120 , with multiplicity two ( one for each polarization @xmath121 ) .",
    "this correspondence means that we can safely use the same formalism throughout the structure .",
    "let us now consider the problem of the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a periodic structure in its completeness , and assume that the network element of fig.[fig : network ] is composed by several 2d periodic layers with thickness @xmath122 , electric permittivity @xmath123 , and magnetic permeability @xmath124 ( @xmath125 , see fig.[fig : nonlamellar ] ) .",

    "the right and left reflection matrices are then defined as ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] ) @xmath150 similarly the left and right transmission operators can be defined as follows @xmath151    imposing the continuity of the tangential fields at the @xmath152 interface means that @xmath153 and the transfer operator that relates the field amplitudes in the @xmath154th and @xmath155th layer is defined as @xmath156 where @xmath157 each single block of the transfer matrix has a dimension @xmath139 .",

    "now we could construct the transfer matrix of the whole structure by iterating through the multilayer ( lamellar or non - lamellar ) structure , and then solve for the reflection operator .",
    "however , if numerically implemented , the transfer matrix method is known to suffer from instabilities when the layers are thick , due to the growing exponentials contained in the transfer matrix @xcite .",

    "( [ smat-1 ] ) due to the exponential decay ( @xmath167 ) of the backward propagating mode .",
    "the layer s - matrix @xmath168 incorporates the propagation phase factor and the interface s - matrices .",
    "again , the s - matrix of the multilayer object can be constructed using an iterative procedure with the following recursion relations    @xmath169    it is clear that the scattering matrix of the multilayer scatterer which connects the incident media ( incident and reflected modes ) to the exit media ( transmitted modes ) is given by @xmath170 .",
    "unfortunately the definition of the scattering matrix in the grating literature @xcite does not match the one used in the network theory ( see section [ casimir ] ) .",
    "however this last one can be obtained by a simple reordering of the block matrices @xmath171 from here all the relevant reflection ( and transmission ) operators for the calculation of the casimir free energy can be obtained .      in the previous section we derived the scattering matrix for a general 2d - periodic structure having in mind a real value for the frequency of the field . for the calculation of the casimir free energy it is more convenient to work with imaginary frequencies from the very beginning , since the quantities entering in eq .",
    "are functions of @xmath172 . from an analysis of the previous section",
    "one can easily realize that the consequence of a ( wick ) rotation in the complex plane ( from the real frequency axis to the imaginary frequency axis ) is automatically connected with the analytical properties of the involved functions .",
    "maxwell waveguide equations can be easily written in terms of imaginary frequency .",

    "clearly now the matrix @xmath82 is real . by looking at the elements of @xmath82",

    "the choice of the definition of the square root and its continuity in the complex plane finally implies that @xmath180 from which it is possible to conclude that @xmath181 , and that @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) is pure imaginary .",
    "since they depend only upon the sign of the eigevalues , the concepts of forward and backward propagation can be easily generalized and we can still write an expansion like , working with imaginary frequency .",
    "the main difference is now that the exponentials are real functions .",
    "the formalism of the scattering matrix can be reapplied to derive the reflection operators at imaginary frequencies .",
    "naturally , in the numeric calculation the necessary truncation of the matrix @xmath82 leads to some small deviations from the previous conclusions .",
    "for example the eigenvalues as a function of the imaginary frequency can acquire a small real part .    in summary , to calculate the casimir free energy between periodic structures",
    "it is sufficient to write the waveguide equation for each matsubara frequency and perform the corresponding modal expansion procedure .",
    "the resulting reflection matrices are then inserted in eq .",
    "and one can choose between the calculation of the determinant of the final expression , or its diagonalization followed by the calculation of the trace of the resulting diagonal matrix .",
    "special attention is required when computing the zero matsubara frequency contribution to the free energy @xmath184 in the scattering formalism .",
    "this will be outlined in the next section .",
    "the computation of the casimir free energy requires explicitly the @xmath11 ( zero matsubara frequency @xmath185 ) scattering matrices from the modal solution to maxwell s equations . in the following",
    "we will consider non - magnetic media for simplicity , @xmath186 .",
    "the zero frequency limit is intrinsically tied to dispersive models of the permittivity since in general the product @xmath187 appears explicitly in maxwell s equations .",
    "therefore , if the permittivity is finite at zero frequency then the electric and magnetic field are irrotational . however ,",
    "if the permittivity has a simple pole at zero frequency the fields are coupled .",
    "the simplest and most useful model for the permittivity of a homogeneous dielectric medium is the oscillator model or drude - lorentz model @xcite .",
    "this model assumes harmonically bound charges to an ion core that makes up a neutralizing background .",
    "the resulting dielectric permittivity is @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the damping coefficient , @xmath190 is the oscillator frequency , and the plasma frequency is defined as @xmath191 this simple model of a dispersive media can be generalized to multiple oscillators with different resonance frequencies , oscillator strengths and linewidths , and forms the basis for models of optical dispersion in dielectrics and metals . the drude model for a metal",
    "is found by considering the limit of free electrons ( i.e @xmath192 of eq .",
    "( [ osc : eq1 ] ) ) and is given by @xmath193 the drude model has two poles , one pole at zero frequency and the other pole in the lower half of the complex plane @xcite .",
    "the connection with constituent relationships in maxwell s equations is obtained by expanding eq.([drude:1 ] ) , @xmath194 and we can identify the first two terms as the debye permittivity , and the last term with the drude conductivity , @xmath195 . in the limit @xmath196 , the drude conductivity is infinite and we recover the london s superconductor @xcite or also plasma model for the metallic media , which is singular at zero frequency .",
    "it is therefore important the order in which the limits are taken , and this can yield differing results @xcite . in all our calculations ,",
    "we consider the zero frequency limit first with finite conductivity at zero frequency .    the zero frequency limit to maxwell s equations ( eq .",

    "these two equations replace the waveguide equations and are the basis for the zero frequency modal solutions .",
    "the corresponding transverse fields are the zero frequency limits of the transverse propagating solutions , and as such are different from purely static solutions .",
    "the zero frequency waveguide equations depend on the @xmath17 component of the magnetic field .",
    "we therefore consider only transverse magnetic ( tm ) zero frequency solutions , @xmath200 , since a non - zero value would imply a dc surface current is flowing , which is inconsistent with a non zero dissipation .",
    "furthermore , for a planar metallic mirror the zero frequency fresnel reflection matrix for the transverse electric ( te ) mode vanishes , and we are therefore restricted to tm solutions ( @xmath200 ) that contribute to the zero matsubara frequency in the expression for casimir free energy . as a technical remark",
    "we point out that in the regions within the structure containing vacuum the conductivity @xmath201 is obviously zero , and the equations above are singular . in the numerics , we choose a vanishingly small but non - zero conductivity for those regions .",
    "the final results turn out to be independent of this choice .",
    "alternatively , we can consider small but finite frequencies approaching the zero frequency limit using the assumed material dispersion .",
    "both approaches lead to the same converged zero frequency contribution for the grating structures examined .",
    "most experiments measuring the casimir force between two objects use a sphere or a spherical lens as one of the intervening objects .",
    "this avoids parallelism issues which could affect the precision required by the measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "although the scattering approach allows one to take into account spherical or even more complicate geometries @xcite , the modal method presented in this paper is not suited for non - periodic , spherical surfaces .",
    "however , the radius of curvature @xmath202 of the sphere ( or spherical lens ) used in experiments is so much larger than the distance to the other plate that one can safely use the so - called proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite . in our case pfa relates the casimir force between a spherical surface and a grating to the free energy per unit of area between a plane and a grating @xmath203 and the force gradient in the sphere - grating configuration is then related to the force per unit area in the plane - grating geometry . the quantity on the r.h.s . can be calculated starting from the results presented in the previous sections . in this section",
    "we benchmark our finite - temperature numerical code against a recent precise measurement of the casimir force gradient between a metallic sphere and a deeply etched ( @xmath204 micron ) 1d lamellar silicon grating @xcite .",
    "we then move on to more complex 2d periodic structures .",
    "the 1d lamellar grating in the experiment of ref.@xcite was p - doped si and the sphere was metallized with au . in order to have a precise comparison between our numerics and the experimental data one should input into our code the actual optical properties of the samples used in the experiment .",
    "unfortunately these were not measured in @xcite , so here we will use tabulated optical data for au and p - doped si , that have been compiled and studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "we model the intrinsic si permittivity by a drude - lorentz model , @xmath205 with @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 rad / s .",
    "the p - doped si is modeled by adding to the intrinsic part a drude background @xmath209 with @xmath210 rad / sec and @xmath211 rad / sec .",
    "similarly , the au sphere is modeled by a drude model @xmath212 with @xmath213 rad / sec and @xmath214 rad / sec .    with the materials parameters at hand",
    ", we can begin comparing the experimental data and the computed exact scattering solution for the grating .",
    "our code is designed for 2d periodic systems , so in order to treat 1d gratings we use a period along the translational invariant direction ( say @xmath104 ) equal to that along the non - invariant direction @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath215 , so that the resulting structure is 2d periodic . in all our calculations",
    "we will truncate all the fourier series to @xmath216 .",
    "this implies that the dimension of the reflection matrices is @xmath217 .",
    "the @xmath92-space integration is performed using a 16pt gauss - legendre quadrature .",
    "we set the temperature to @xmath218k , and use the first 36 matsubara frequencies for all the studied range of distances between the sphere and the grating .",
    "m , and the temperature is set to @xmath218k . ,",
    "width=340 ]    m , and the temperature is set to @xmath218k .",
    ", width=340 ]    we consider the two 1d lamellar gratings used in @xcite .",
    "the casimir force in the plane - grating configuration is evaluated by numerical differentiation of the plane - grating free energy .",
    "the resulting force gradient in the sphere - gradient geometry calculated with our numerical code is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : forcegradienta ] and [ fig : forcegradientb ] , where we also show the experimental data with their errors , kindly provided to us by h.b . chan . given the uncertainty in the optical parameters used in our numerics compared those of the actual samples",
    ", the experiment - theory agreement seems to be very reasonable .",
    "a calculation of the reduced chi square gives @xmath219 for sample a and @xmath220 for sample b. one can also test the deviations of the exact numerical results from the prediction of the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) . in this approximation , the force between the plane and the deeply etched grating is computed by multiplying the force between two plane ( i.e. , the usual lifshitz force for the plane - plane geometry ) by the filling factor of the grating ( we neglect the contribution of the bottom part of the grating to the pfa result since its depth is sufficiently large ) . in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : forcegradienta ] and [ fig : forcegradientb ] we plot the ratio between the exact and pfa results for the casimir force gradients in the sphere - grating configuration .",
    "there are three sets of data represented in those insets : a ) the solid line is the ratio of our exact numerics and the theoretical pfa prediction based on lifshitz theory , both using the parameters above for the optical data of the samples ; b ) the hollow circles with their error bars are the ratio of the experimental data of @xcite for the force gradient in sphere - grating geometry with respect to the  experimental \" pfa .",
    "this last data set was obtained from a separate measurement of the force gradient in the sphere - plane geometry and subsequently multiplied by the grating s filling factor@xcite .",
    "note that since the plane and the grating in @xcite were fabricated following identical procedures",
    ", one can expect them to have the same optical properties ; c ) the squares represent the ratio of our exact numerics and the  experimental \" pfa .",
    "given the uncertainty in the optical parameters used in the numerics , the most unbiased comparison is to compare case b ) against case c ) . in that case , one is effectively comparing numerators normalized by the same denominator .",
    "again , the theory - experiment comparison is reasonably good in view of the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .     and @xmath221 , respectively .",
    "the etch depth for all the structures is 1070 nm .",
    "for all cases , a au sphere with radius @xmath222 m has been used .",
    "it has also been assumed that the temperature is @xmath218k .",
    "we find that the force gradient scales as the filling factor .",
    "the deviation from the pfa is shown in the inset and scales this time with inverse of the filling factor , having the strongest deviation in the case of the pillars.,width=340 ]    the numerical errors in the computation of the casimir force originate from three sources : 1 ) the truncation of the matsubara frequency summation , 2 ) the truncation of the discrete spatial frequency spectrum resulting in finite dimensional reflection matrices , and 3 ) numerical integration over the continuous transverse wavevector in the first brillioun zone .",
    "the truncation of the matsubara summation is determined by the temperature and the minimum distance required in the force displacement curve .",
    "this minimum distance sets the maximum matsubara frequency for fixed temperature , such that for a minimum spacing of 100 nm at 300k , we find that 36 matsubara frequencies give free energy convergence of better than 10@xmath223 .",
    "this frequency cutoff is used in all numerical results presented here .",
    "the truncation of the discrete spatial frequency ( diffraction orders ) is necessitated by the need to deal with finite matrices .",
    "our modal approach improves with increasing number of diffraction orders but so does the computational cost . by increasing the number of diffraction orders , we find that the short distance behaviour for the grating is improved .",
    "we have used @xmath224 for all calculations , which was observed to be enough to ensure the convergence at approximately 1% accuracy .",
    "it is important to note that matrices are dense and scale as @xmath225 , which limits practically the spatial frequency cutoff .",
    "the final source of numerical error is the numerical integration over the continuous transverse wavevector in the first brillioun zone .",
    "it is desirable to have minimal @xmath226-space sampling to reduce the assembly and computation of the reflection matrices for each matsubara frequency .",
    "the integration of the continuous wavevector is performed numerically using a an n - point gauss legendre quadrature . in order to estimate the integration error ,",
    "we have computed the the force gradient for 5 different n - point ( 9,16,25,36,49 ) gaussian quadratures in the 1st brillioun zone .",
    "the relative error , the standard deviation divided by the mean , for the experimental displacement range is less than 3% and quite small at small displacement .",
    "this is quite reasonable since the force gradient at large separations is quite small so small standard deviations give large relative error . from our three estimates of error , our estimated total error in computing the casimir force is expected to be less than 3% over the entire force gradient displacement curve .",
    "the detailed analysis of the 1d lamellar grating problem allowed us to validate the scattering approach by comparing to high precision experimental data . here",
    "we want to extend the method to 2d periodic structures which provide more tailorable properties in which we can manipulate the casimir force .",
    "we will consider two simple but representative extensions of the 1d grating .",
    "the first example is an array of p - doped si pillars .",
    "similar geometries have been used to obtain a negative index of refraction @xcite in the optical range @xcite .",
    "they have also been exploited to investigate the phenomenon of quantum reflection @xcite of an atom over the purely attractive casimir - polder potential generated by the periodic structure .",
    "the second case is the complementary structure , i.e. a free standing membrane etched with an array of square holes .",
    "this structure is very similar to the one used to measure the extraordinary light transmission through sub - wavelength apertures @xcite .    in fig.[2d - structures ] we show the prediction for casimir force gradient for the sample b 1d grating ( dash - dotted line ) , the pillars ( dotted line ) , and the membrane ( dashed line ) .",
    "the period of the structures is in all cases 400 nm and the eteched depth is 1070 nm , and the filling factor of the pillars and of the membrane are @xmath227 and @xmath221 , respectively . we find that the casimir force gradient scales as the filling factor , i.e. the force is less attractive for the pillars than for the membrane , with the case of grating in between these two cases . the inset shows the comparison with the relative pfa approximation ( filling factor times the lifshitz force between plane and sphere ) . if the pfa were valid , the ratio ( inset ) would be unity for all separations .",
    "the deviation from the additive approximation scales with the inverse of the filling factor , having the strongest deviation in the case of the pillars .",
    "we have developed a finite - temperature modal approach to compute casimir interactions between 2d periodic structures .",
    "we have compared our computational approach to high precision published experimental data for 1d lamellar gratings .",
    "this benchmark validated our modal approach and led to good agreement between theory and experiment , as confirmed by a reduced chi square values of @xmath228 and @xmath229 for the two samples used in @xcite .    in order to demonstrate the flexibility of our approach , we also calculated the casimir force between the first simple extensions of a 1d grating , namely an array of square pillars and an array of square holes . in both cases , as already known for the 1d grating , we observe deviation of the casimir force gradient from the value obtained from the proximity force approximation",
    ". this deviation scales with the filling factor and it is more accentuated in the case of the pillars .",
    "we plan in the near future to extend these results to complex metallic structures , such as 3d metamaterials , which were recognized as possible candidates to engineer the casimir force between two vacuum separated objects .",
