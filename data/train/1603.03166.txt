    "<S> we study the ground - state phase diagram and dynamics of the one - dimensional cluster model with several competing interactions . paying particular attention to the relation between the entanglement spectrum ( es ) and the bulk topological ( winding ) number , we first map out the ground - state phases of the model and determine the universality classes of the transitions from the exact solution . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the dynamical properties during interaction sweeps through the critical points of topological phase transitions . when the sweep speed is slow , the correlation functions and the entanglement entropy exhibit spatially periodic structures . on top of this , </S>",
    "<S> the levels in the es oscillate temporally during the dynamics . by explicitly calculating the above quantities for excited states , we attribute these behaviors to the bogoliubov quasiparticles generated near the critical points . </S>",
