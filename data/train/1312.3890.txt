    "the location of the subsystem enters , but only via a finite additive term . while found originally for homogeneous chains , these features persist if one adds couplings or potentials which vary in space according to power laws .",
    "such studies have been performed for xx spin chains @xcite , the transverse ising model @xcite the xy model @xcite and free fermions in the continuum @xcite . in all these cases",
    ", one has logarithmic laws , either in the subsystem size or in a typical length connected with the perturbation or in the particle number , and the prefactor is the same as in the homogeneous case .",
    "however , although bipartitions of various kinds have been considered , one has been looking essentially only at bulk properties .    on the other hand , a system of free particles in a trapping potential has not only a varying density , but also a well - defined surface region , where this density falls to zero smoothly .",
    "the same is true for fronts evolving from an initially step - like magnetization in xx @xcite or xxz chains @xcite , and it was pointed out recently that these surfaces have common universal features @xcite . in traps this is related to the linear variation of the potential near the fermi energy @xcite , while the xx fronts can be mapped exactly to a static problem with a completely linear potential @xcite .",
    "this raises the question about the entanglement in such surfaces and its relation to the bulk properties .",

    ", one has logarithmic laws also in the surface region , both for the entanglement entropy and for the closely related particle fluctuations .",

    "the approach is also very instructive , because in the variables @xmath112 one comes back essentially to a homogeneous problem .",
    "the kernel @xmath97 is a sine kernel times a factor and @xmath98 resembles a reflected sine kernel times a factor , but these factors do not influence the leading behaviour and the final result in terms of the variable @xmath1 actually _ is _ the homogeneous one .",

    "the scaling laws ( [ entropy_surf ] ) and ( [ soshnikov ] ) found in the previous section describe the entanglement and particle fluctuations in the surface region .",
