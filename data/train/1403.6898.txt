    "a point - like x - ray source , xmmuj172054.5@xmath0372652 , was found @xmath8 west of the brightest region .",

    "they suggest that the molecular gas suppressed the expansion of the remnant and formed the peculiar asymmetric morphology .",
    "the distance and age are estimated to be 4.510.7  kpc and @xmath10 years old , respectively @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the snr is reproduced by a two - component model : a high - temperature ( @xmath11  kev ) plasma in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) and a low - temperature ( @xmath12  kev ) plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) @xcite .",
    "the abundances of the former are super - solar and those of the latter are 1  solar , which suggests ejecta and interstellar medium ( ism ) origin , respectively .",
    "the metal abundances of the ejecta are as high as 10  solar although the statistical errors are quite large .",

    "although the source sizes of g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 are larger than this radius , we still examine the dust scattering effect .",
    "we made the spectra of the snrs from areas larger by in radius than those in figure  [ img ] ( solid lines ) ( e.g. for g349 + 0.2 , the radius of the larger area is , while the original source area is radius . ) .",
    "the best - fit @xmath30 of the spectra from the larger areas are @xmath132 and @xmath133  @xmath37 for g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 , respectively , which are consistent with those given in table  [ tab : para ] .",
    "therefore , the dust scattering effect is not significant in the @xmath30 estimation for these snrs .    for the distance estimation , we assume that the interstellar gas density is proportional to the stellar density of the galactic disk given by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the x - ray absorption column density @xmath30 between the snrs and nearby grxe are 1.1 and 1.6 for g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 , respectively ( see tables [ tab : bg ] and [ tab : para ] ) . integrating the gas density along the line of sight",
    ", we search for the distance , where the integrated gas density becomes to @xmath30 ( at 8.5 kpc ) @xmath134 @xmath30 ratio ( 1.1 for g350.1@xmath00.3 and 1.6 for g349.7@xmath10.2 ) . here",
    "we assume @xmath135 of the grxe is that of the midpoint of the galactic ridge along the line of sight ( 8.5  kpc )",
    ". then the distances are estimated to be @xmath136  kpc and @xmath137  kpc for g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 , respectively .    since the stellar density model @xcite does not include local enhancement of interstellar media ( e.g. the 3  kpc arms ; @xcite ) , we make the ir extinction curves by @xcite= up to distance of @xmath138  kpc . ] , and re - estimate the distance with the same method as described above",
    ". then the re - estimated distance of g350.1@xmath00.3 is @xmath139  kpc , consistent with that taken from the stellar density model ( @xmath136  kpc ) .",
    "no ir extinction curve is available at the position of g349.7@xmath10.2 .",
    "we therefore use one of the nearby data at @xmath140 , and obtain a distance of @xmath141  kpc , which is also consistent with that derived from the stellar density model ( @xmath137  kpc ) .",
    "however , the near - by data show significant spatial variations , and are different from @xcite .",
    "we estimate the distance variation using these data , and found the variations to be @xmath423  kpc .",
    "thus we regard the systematic distance error for g349.7@xmath10.2 using the current ir extinction data is @xmath423  kpc .",
    "the variation of the @xmath30 obtained by the x - ray observations in the @xmath142 , @xmath143 region is less than 30% ( 90% error ) ( h. uchiyama , private communication ) .",
    "this would be another source of the distance uncertainty .",
    "taking into account of all these possible systematic errors , we adopt the distances of g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 to be 9@xmath933 and 12@xmath935 kpc , respectively .",
    "the distance of g350.1@xmath00.3 is consistent with , while that g349.7@xmath10.2 is smaller than those of the previous reports @xcite .",
    "we will estimate the ejecta masses for both the snrs as below . as we mentioned in [ g349_origin ] , we should deal with lighter elements which do not appear in the relevant energy band of @xmath23 1.2  kev to estimate the physical condition of the plasma such as the emission measure ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "since the ejecta abundances are similar to those of 1525  and 3540  progenitor stars for g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 , respectively , we assume that the abundances of elements lighter than mg in the nei component ( ejecta ) are those of the cc - sn model of a 20  and 40  progenitor @xcite for g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 , respectively and re - fit the spectra . as a result ,",
    "the emission measures become @xmath41/4 and @xmath41/5 , 5.4(@xmath930.5)@xmath13410@xmath110  @xmath50 and 1.7@xmath1440.2)@xmath13410@xmath9  @xmath50 for g350.1@xmath00.3 and g349.7@xmath10.2 , respectively .",
    "we then take the ratio between the electron and atomic hydrogen densities to be @xmath1451.6 and 1.7 and the number ratio of all the nucleons to hydrogen to be 2.1 and 2.5 in the 20  and 40  progenitor , respectively .",
    "assuming an oblate spheroid with major and minor radii of @xmath146 and @xmath147 for g350.1@xmath00.3 @xcite and a sphere with a radius of @xmath148 for g349.7@xmath10.2 @xcite , the ejecta masses are estimated to be @xmath413  @xmath149  for g350.1@xmath00.3 and @xmath424  @xmath150  for g349.7@xmath10.2 , where @xmath151 is a filling factor .",
    "@xmath152 and @xmath153 are the distance parameters in unit of 9  kpc and 12  kpc , respectively",
    ". these are roughly consistent with those estimated by the abundance patterns of 1525  and 3540  , respectively .",
    "after the submission of this draft , @xcite reported a revised kinematic distance of g349.7@xmath10.2 to be about 11.5 kpc , which agrees well with our result .",
