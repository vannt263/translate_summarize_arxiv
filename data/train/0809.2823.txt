    "the perturbative contribution to @xmath10 provides the main source of sensitivity to @xmath27 .",
    "the value of the strong coupling in the complex plane can be computed assuming the validity of the renormalisation group equation  ( rge ) outside the real axis , and using a taylor series of @xmath28 .    in the fixed order perturbation theory  ( fopt ) , at each integration step , the taylor expansion is made around the physical value @xmath29 .",
    "this can cause important problems as the absolute value of @xmath30 gets large and the convergence speed of the series is reduced  @xcite . in addition , a cut at a fixed order in @xmath29 is applied on the taylor series and on the integration result in fopt .",
    "therefore , important known higher order terms are neglected , yielding additional systematic uncertainties .",
    "a better suited method is cipt which , at each integration step , computes @xmath31 using the value found at the previous step . in this approach",
    "the taylor expansion is always used for small absolute values of its parameter , hence excellent convergence properties .",
    "one can analytically prove that the fopt result can also be obtained by making small steps , with a fixed order cut of the result at each step .",
    "however , in that case the effective rge is modified at every single step .",

    ". we should emphasize the fact that , on the contrary to cipt , the fopt solution is problematic even on the real axis , generally not satisfying to the rge .    for numerical applications we have used geometric growth estimations for the first unknown coefficients @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". we have tested that cipt is less sensitive to changes of these coefficients , and it also exhibits a smaller scale dependence than fopt .",
    "numerically , the difference of the perturbative contributions computed with the two methods is about @xmath45 .",
    "in fact this difference could have been much larger if not for the properties of the kernel in the integral ( [ eq : an ] ) which has small absolute values in the region where the @xmath31 predictions of the two methods are rather different  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we analysed further problems with the perturbative series for fopt when the integration over the circular contour is performed .",
    "cipt behaves better than fopt and is to be preferred .",
    "the difference between the results obtained with the two approaches is not to be interpreted as a systematic theoretical error , but rather like a problem of fopt  @xcite .",
    "it is known that ope describes only part of the nonperturbative effects . in order to estimate the impact of the missing contributions , we test two models based on resonances and on instantons .",
    "we add their contributions to the theoretical prediction , choosing parameters that provide a good fit to the v+a spectral function near the @xmath1 mass .",
    "for these models , we find corrections situated within our systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain additional experimental information , we use spectral moments defined as @xmath46 they allow one to better exploit the shape of the spectral functions and they suppress the region where ope fails .",
    "the corresponding theoretical prediction is very similar to the one for @xmath47 with consequent perturbative and nonperturbative contributions . due to strong correlations ,",
    "we use only @xmath48  ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) and four additional moments  ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) to simultaneously fit @xmath0 and the leading d = 4 , 6 , 8 nonperturbative contributions .    in spite of the fact that the nonperturbative contributions fitted for the v and a spectral functions have opposite signs and they are much larger than those from v+a , we find an excellent agreement between the values found for @xmath0 from the three fits .",
    "the result of the fit to the v+a spectral moments reads @xmath53 where the first error is experimental and the second is theoretical .",
    "when evolving this value to the z scale  @xcite(see fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] ) one gets @xmath54 where the first two errors are propagated from  ( [ astau - res ] ) , and the last one summarises uncertainties in the evolution . the consistency between this result and the value found by a global fit to electroweak data at the z - mass scale  @xcite , @xmath55 , provides the most powerful present test of the evolution of the strong interaction coupling , over a range of @xmath18 spanning more than three orders of magnitude .     to higher scales @xmath56 using the four - loop rge and the three - loop matching conditions applied at the heavy quark - pair thresholds ( hence the discontinuities at @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
