    "the inverse compton scattering of free electrons in the intracluster plasma with the photons of the cosmic background radiation produce secondary fluctuations in background radiation temperature maps .",

    "simulations suggest that the distribution of these temperature fluctuations will be quite non - gaussian ( seljak , burwell & pen 2001 ) , and that the best hope of detecting this effect is in the tails of the distribution ( e.g. da silva et al . 2000 ) . in this paper , rather than studying the distribution of temperature fluctuations in random pixels ,",
    "we study the distribution of fluctuations in pixels which are peaks .",
    "we show that the distribution of these peak heights should be highly non - gaussian , and that the exact shape can be computed if the spectrum of initial density fluctuations is known .",
    "comparison with estimates of the peak height distribution from large @xmath2-body simulations shows that our model is quite accurate .",
    "this means that observations of the peaks alone should allow one to place constraints on what the initial conditions must have been . in this paper , we restrict attention to the simplest case in which signals come from a single redshift , chosen to be close to the present epoch , when nonlinear structures have already grown .",
    "work in progress studies contributions from higher redshifts ; even when a range of redshifts contribute , our conclusion that the final distribution of fluctuations should be non - gaussian , and related to the initial density fluctuation distribution , should remain unchanged .",

    "section  [ simuls ] describes our simulations briefly .",
    "section  [ kszeffect ] studies the kinematic effect , and section  [ tszeffect ] studies the thermal effect .",

    "we emphasize that , if the kinematic effect arises from the peculiar velocities of clusters , then a large simulation box such as ours is essential for studying this effect : smaller boxes miss a significant fraction of the power which generates velocities , so they are liable to underestimate the magnitude of the effect ( see sheth & diaferio 2001 for more discussion on the finite box size effect ) . in addition",
    ", our large simulation contains a large number of massive haloes which smaller simulation boxes are likely to misestimate .",
    "the proper population of massive halos is essential for studying the distribution of the thermal effect ( e.g. refregier & teyssier 2000 ) .    from the simulation outputs we create maps of the thermal sz effect , the kinematic sz effect , and the thomson optical depth .",
    "we compute the local gas density and velocity from those of dark matter , and the gas temperature is computed from the local dark matter velocity dispersion , following the procedure outlined in diaferio , sunyaev , & nusser ( 2000 ) .",

    "the panels on the left of their figure  3 show that the mean peak height for the thermal sz effect scales with the square of @xmath25 , the optical depth : @xmath26 .",

    "the width of the gaussian increases linearly with @xmath25 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigmatau ] .",
    "the distribution of the peak heights is got by integrating over all @xmath25 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the gaussian distribution of @xmath22 at fixed @xmath25 .",

    "=      if we think of the integral along the line of sight @xmath17 as a sum over discrete pixels , then we can ask how the density and the velocity in pixels change as we step through @xmath17 . as we do this , it is likely that some pixels along the line of sight will contain , or lie within , dark matter haloes . because the virial motions within haloes are random , the component of @xmath33 which is due to the virial motions will fluctuate around zero .",
    "the result of integrating over all @xmath17 is that these internal virial motions will cancel out , so only the bulk peculiar velocities of the haloes contribute to the line of sight integration .",
    "in addition , there may be contributions to the integral from pixels which do not contain haloes .",
    "however , the density within a halo is on the order of two hundred times @xmath34 .",
    "so , provided that the motions of haloes are not significantly smaller than the motions in less dense regions , and provided that velocities are not correlated over scales which are on the order of two hundred times larger than the size of a typical halo , pixels associated with haloes contribute much more to the line of sight integral than do the much less dense pixels which have nothing to do with haloes .",
    "in this respect , our analysis is similar to that in cole & kaiser ( 1988 ) and peebles & juszkiewicz ( 1998 ) .",
    "haloes are rare , so , for sufficiently small pixels , it is unlikely that a given line of sight will contain more than one halo .",
    "moreover , the haloes have central density cusps ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , peaks in the @xmath22 distribution occur in those pixels which contain the density cusps .",
    "we assume that there is one density cusp per halo , so the number density of peaks in the @xmath22 distribution should approximately equal the number density of haloes . moreover , we can replace the integral over the line of sight by the value the integrand had at the position of the peak : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bulk velocity of the halo , @xmath37 is the speed of light , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are intended to denote the average density contributed by the halo over the range of pixels along the line of sight , @xmath39 , it occupied .",

    "this is sensible , since , in this limit , the entire halo fits in the cell .",
    "the more massive haloes have larger scale radii and so they also have larger optical depths ; at large @xmath40 , @xmath57 is approximately proportional to @xmath58 ( see fig .  [ taum ] ) . for our purposes in this section ,",
    "the important point is that the optical depth is a monotonically increasing function of halo mass .    to show that this conclusion is not terribly sensitive to the details of the density run in the outer regions of haloes",
    ", the other dot - dashed curve shows the optical depth associated with the profile shape presented in hernquist ( 1990 ) .",
    "the appendix shows that , for this profile shape also , the relevant integrals can all be computed analytically .",
    "( we will describe the other two curves in the next section . )",
    "the hernquist profile scales as @xmath59 ; although it falls more steeply at large radii , it has the same small scale slope as the navarro et al . profile .",
    "the fact that the optical depths for these two parametrizations of halo profile shapes are so similar shows that most of the contribution to the optical depth comes from the inner parts of the haloes , where the profiles themselves are similar .    what about halo speeds ?",
    "sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) showed that , if the initial density fluctuation field was gaussian , then to a good approximation , the speeds of dark matter haloes are drawn from a maxwellian distribution , even at late times .",
    "in addition , they showed that the rms halo speed could be computed from linear theory , and that it is approximately independent of halo mass .",
    "for example , at @xmath60 in the @xmath50cdm model we are considering , @xmath61 where the halo mass @xmath40 is expressed in units of @xmath62 . at @xmath60 a typical halo has @xmath63 , so that the results to follow are essentially unchanged if we set @xmath64  km / s and ignore the @xmath40 dependence .",
    "this means that , to a good approximation , the distribution of halo speeds along the line of sight , @xmath36 , is gaussian , and that this gaussian is independent of the optical depth along the line of sight , @xmath25 .",
    "since the peaks in the kinematic effect have @xmath65 , where @xmath25 and @xmath36 are the values for the halo in the peak pixel , the discussion above implies that the distribution of @xmath22 peak heights is really obtained by taking the product of two independent distributions . in particular ,",
    "because a halo s motion is independent of its mass , the distribution of @xmath36 is independent of @xmath25 , so the width of the distribution of @xmath22 at fixed @xmath25 should be proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "this is consistent with our fig .",
    "[ sigmatau ] . secondly ,",
    "at fixed @xmath25 , the distribution of @xmath22 is really just the distribution of a constant times the distribution of @xmath36 .",
    "because halo motions are gaussian , the distribution of @xmath22 at fixed @xmath25 should be gaussian ; this is consistent with our fig .",
    "[ fixedt ] .",
    "( it is worth adding that sheth & diaferio 2001 showed that the rms motions of haloes are higher in the dense regions .",
    "this explains why , in the lower panels in figure  3 of diaferio et al .",
    "2000 , the scatter in @xmath22 at fixed @xmath25 is larger in the densest regions of their simulations . )    finally , because peaks correspond to haloes , the comoving number density of peaks equals the comoving number density of haloes .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the probability that a halo of mass @xmath40 has optical depth @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath67 where we have written @xmath68 instead of @xmath37 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the second equality follows from writing @xmath70 , and using our assumption that the distribution of @xmath36 is approximately independent of halo mass .",
    "the final expression follows from using the fact that @xmath71 and rearranging the order of the integrals .",
    "because the integral over @xmath40 leaves a function of @xmath25 only , the final expression shows that , at fixed @xmath25 , the distribution of @xmath22 is given by the distribution of @xmath36 .",
    "since this is gaussian , our model produces a distribution of @xmath22 which , at fixed @xmath25 , is gaussian , in agreement with the simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fixedt ] ) .    to compute our model for the full distribution of @xmath22",
    ", we need a model for the distribution of @xmath25 at fixed @xmath40 .",
    "we will do this in the next section . for now , note that if this distribution is sharply peaked about a mean value , say @xmath57 given by equation  ( [ taumav ] ) , then we can replace @xmath72 with a delta function .",

    "the final integrand above is the product of the halo mass function and a gaussian whose width increases as @xmath40 increases .",
    "this sort of integral is just like that studied by sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) in their model of why the peculiar velocity distribution of dark matter particles is not maxwellian . in that case , the final distribution was got by summing gaussians of different widths because the virial velocities did contribute to the statistic , and the rms virial velocities within haloes scale as @xmath75 . here",
    ", the virial motions do not enter , but the gaussians have different widths because the optical depth scales approximately as @xmath76 .    in the next section , we will show that , in fact , @xmath72 is not a delta function",
    ". nevertheless , it is reasonably sharply peaked , so that the delta function is not a bad approximation .",
    "of course , there is a small price to pay for the gain in simplicity .",
    "our final expression above suggests that the distribution of @xmath22 at fixed @xmath40 should be gaussian .",
    "this is a direct consequence of our neglect of the scatter in @xmath25 at fixed @xmath40 .",
    "if we include the effects of the scatter ( along the lines we describe in the next section ) then the first line of equation  ( [ pkszfull ] ) above shows clearly that , even at fixed @xmath40 , the distribution of @xmath22 is got by summing up gaussians of different dispersions , so it will be quite non - gaussian .",
    "finally , we need to specify how the number density of haloes depends on halo mass . to get the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ kszpdf ] , we used the halo mass function @xmath41 given by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "the model provides a good description of the simulations at @xmath60 .",
    "the dashed curves show the predicted contribution to the distribution from haloes in different mass bins : the central spike of the distribution is from small mass haloes ( @xmath77 ) , whereas the broad wings are entirely due to the more massive haloes ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuation due to the thermal effect is @xmath79 where @xmath80 , the second line shows what happens in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( @xmath81 , the only limit we will consider in this paper ) , and the third line shows the approximation diaferio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used to relate the density @xmath82 and line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath83 of dark matter particles in their simulations to the density and temperature of electrons .",
    "namely , we are assuming that the gas and the dark matter have similar spherically symmetric density profiles with isotropic velocity dispersions , so the additional assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium determines the velocity dispersion profile of the gas uniquely .    before moving on ,",
    "a word on the relative amplitudes of the thermal and kinematic effects is in order .",
    "the first line of equation  ( [ tszl ] ) shows that the amplitude of the thermal effect depends on frequency . the kinematic effect , on the other hand , is independent of frequency . in the rayleigh - jeans limit ,",
    "the amplitude of the thermal effect is much larger than that of the kinematic effect .",
    "however , the thermal effect effectively vanishes at a frequency near 217ghz . because the kinematic effect does not depend on frequency , the non - gaussian signature due to the kinematic effect is important near 217ghz .",
    "diaferio et al . showed that , to a good approximation , @xmath84 , where the optical depth @xmath25 was defined in the previous section .",

    "this section describes a model for why this happens , which allows us to compute the distribution of @xmath85 peak heights .",
    "=    our model for the distribution of peaks in the thermal effect is similar in spirit to that for the kinematic effect : each peak in @xmath85 is associated with the centre of a dark matter halo , we ignore the effect of haloes overlapping along the line of sight .",
    "this means that we can replace the integral over the line of sight in equation  ( [ tszl ] ) by an integral over the density - weighted temperature profile of the single halo of mass @xmath40 and concentration @xmath42 which happened to be in the line of sight : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and all distances are in units of the scale radius @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the virial radius and @xmath42 the concentration parameter ( equation  [ nfwparams ] ) . as before ,",
    "the integral over @xmath90 represents the beam smoothing .",
    "this shows that the thermal effect is proportional to the integral of the density times the internal velocity dispersion , projected along the line of sight ( recall that the kinematic effect is proportional to the density times the line - of - sight bulk motion of the halo ) .    in principle",

    "although the shape of @xmath92 is different from the circular velocity profile @xmath93 , the two profiles are not very different .",

    "( 1997 ) , so we expect that using it provides a reasonable analytic approximation .",
    "the upper solid curve in fig .  [ taum ] shows our analytic expression for the beam averaged @xmath96 associated with hernquist profiles when the squared circular velocity is used for @xmath91 , and the dashed curve shows the result of using the actual dispersion .",

    "moreover , the dashed line shows a slope slightly steeper than two at high masses , as it is indeed seen in fig 6 .",
    "the constant of proportionality is of order two , consistent with the simulations .",
    "the difference between the solid and the dashed @xmath85 curves can be thought of approximately illustrating what might happen if our assumption that the gas traces the spherically symmetric dark matter distribution is relaxed .",

    "so the shape of the distribution of peaks is determined by the mass function of clusters , and by how clusters move .",

    "the primary fluctuations are gaussian distributed with an rms , on arcminute scales , of about @xmath107 .",
    "this rms is a few times larger than the typical thermal sz effect , and an order of magnitude larger than the typical kinematic sz effect .",
    "however , in our @xmath50cdm model , the sz effect fluctuations and the primary fluctuations dominate the angular power spectrum of the cmb on substantially different scales , which separate at @xmath108 ( e.g. springel , white & hernquist 2001 ) .",
    "thus , in principle , an optimal high - pass filter for the arcminute scale should be able to isolate the peaks due to the sz effects from the primary fluctuations .    =    if we put our simulation box at z=0.218 , then the angular size of one pixel is 1 arcminute , and the whole box occupies 40@xmath109 @xmath110 40@xmath109",
    "square - degrees . in fig .",
    "[ maps ] , we show a small 8@xmath109 @xmath110 8@xmath109 piece of the whole map , so as to make smaller angular scale structures visible . for the analysis in fig .",
    "[ filtpdf ] , however , we use the entire map . the top panel in figure  [ maps ] shows a simulated temperature map in which the @xmath85 effect fluctuations are superimposed on the primary fluctuations generated at the last scattering epoch .",
    "we made a two dimensional random gaussian field for the primary temperature fluctuations .",
    "we computed the angular power spectrum by cmbfast for the @xmath50cdm model we consider here .",
    "the bottom panel shows the effect of applying a high - pass filter of scale one arcminute to this map ; the large scale modulations are gone , and only small scale fluctuations remain .",
    "[ filtpdf ] shows the distribution of temperature peak heights in the simulated map which has both primary and @xmath85 fluctuations ( dashed histogram ) and in the high - pass filtered map ( solid histogram ) ; i.e. , the peak height distributions in the maps shown in fig .",
    "the gaussian - like shape of the dashed curve for the unfiltered map is primarily due to the peak height distribution of the intrinsic peaks ( we have verified that it is similar to the analytic formula for peaks in two - dimensional gaussian random fields given in bond & efstathiou 1987 ) ; the @xmath85 peaks account for most of the large decrement tail .",
    "the solid histogram in the left panel , from the filtered map , is slightly asymmetric .",
    "if we assume that the positive peaks are due to the intrinsic cmb fluctuations , whereas the decrements are either intrinsic or @xmath85 peaks , then subtracting the positive side from the negative one should leave the @xmath85 peak distribution .",
    "the dashed histogram in the right panel shows what remains after doing this subtraction .",
    "it should be compared with the true distribution of @xmath85 peaks which we presented earlier in the paper , and is now shown as the solid histogram .",
    "the smooth solid curve shows what our model predicts .",
    "notice how similar the dashed and solid histograms are .",
    "this demonstrates that by suitably filtering the map , it should be possible to recover the true distribution of @xmath85 peaks , and that the our model does a good job of describing this distribution .",
    "unfortunately , this method will not work for recovering the distribution of the @xmath22 peaks .",
    "to distinguish the kinematic from the thermal effect , we must use their different spectral properties : multi - band follow - up observations of regions with deep and highly clustered @xmath85 decrements will assure the presence of a supercluster where the @xmath22 effect is largest ( e.g. diaferio et al",
    ". 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath85 peaks will also show up in clustering statistics .",
    "the shape of the correlation function of the peaks which were imprinted on the background radiation at the last scattering surface depends on peak height ( bond & efstathiou 1987 ; heavens & sheth 1999 ; heavens & gupta 2001 ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath85 peaks will change this dependence because , as our model shows , the two - point correlation function of the sz peaks is related to the two - point correlation function of massive clusters .",
    "since accurate analytical models for the clustering of clusters exist ( e.g. mo & white 1996 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ) , the clustering of the peaks in the sz effect can be estimated rather easily , although we have not done so here .",
    "the clustering of clusters depends differently on the initial spectrum of fluctuations than the clustering of intrinsic peaks does ; therefore , our model for the @xmath85 peak distribution will be important if one wishes to obtain constraints on the initial fluctuation spectrum by studying the two - point and higher order moments of peaks in the microwave background on arcminute scales .",
    "finally , note that our model assumes that there is a one - to - one correspondence between a peak in the kinematic or thermal effects and the presence of a massive cluster .",
    "we showed that , at low redshift , this is a good approximation ",
    "our model describes the simulations quite well . at higher redshifts",
    "this assumption is likely to break down for the kinematic sz effect .",
    "this is because , at higher redshifts , there are fewer massive haloes with sufficiently high optical depths to produce obvious peaks",
    ". in particular , the number density of massive clusters drops faster than does the typical coherent  flow speed , so that , at higher redshifts , an increasing fraction of peaks will be caused by the velocity field , rather than by the density field .",
    "since the kinematic peaks due to coherent flows at high redshift have a different angular structure from those due to nearby clusters , an optimal filter will be able to distinguish the two types of peaks .",
    "developing a model for this additional effect is the subject of work in progress .",
