    "electron - neutrino and electron - anti - neutrino scattering off electrons have played an important role in the searches for neutrino oscillations .",
    "first hinted by the data from solar and atmospheric neutrinos , oscillations have subsequently been confirmed with reactor and accelerator data  @xcite .",
    "altogether , these experiments now give clear evidence that neutrinos are massive  @xcite and , therefore , expected to be endowed with non - standard interactions that may violate leptonic flavour and/or break weak universality  @xcite .",
    "future experiments , such as borexino  @xcite , aim to use the same reaction for detecting lower energy solar neutrinos .",
    "the standard model cross section for this process has been known since the 70 s  @xcite , when the first measurements have been carried out  @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections have been calculated more recently in  @xcite and there have been recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "currently there are many proposals to perform new experiments either at relatively high energies  @xcite , in order to test the nutev anomaly  @xcite , as well as at low energies  @xcite , motivated by the search for a possible non - zero transition neutrino magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , it has been long noticed that massive neutrinos are expected to have non - standard interactions that may arise either from the structure of the charged and neutral current weak interactions in seesaw  type models  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they could arise from the exchange of scalar bosons , as present in radiative and/or supersymmetric models of neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the expected nsi depends strongly on the model .",
    "here we adopt a model independent approach of simply analyzing their phenomenological implications in neutrino electron scattering .",
    "for previous recent studies see refs  @xcite .",
    "this possibility has been revived recently as it was noted that both solar and atmospheric neutrino data are consistent with sizable values of the nsi parameters  @xcite . for the case of neutrino interactions with the down ",
    "quark , it has been shown that the presence of nsi brings in an ambiguous determination of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters , with a new solution in the so  called `` dark side '' ( with @xmath2  @xcite ) , degenerate with the conventional one , even after taking into account data from the kamland experiment .",
    "for the case of @xmath3 nsi the couplings are also allowed to be large  @xcite .    in this work we concentrate in the detailed study of @xmath3 and @xmath1 scattering in the presence of non - standard neutrino interactions , which can not be found in previous studies , e.  g. refs",
    "we focus on short baseline terrestrial experiments such as the lsnd @xmath3 scattering and a variety of @xmath1 scattering experiments using reactor neutrinos , exploiting their complementarity .",
    "our analysis is new in two ways .",
    "first we relax the conditions under which the constraints on weak couplings have been previously derived .",
    "second , we update the study through the inclusion of more recent data , such as the recent data from the munu experiment  @xcite . also for completeness",
    ", we include the results from the rovno reactor  @xcite",
    ". moreover , the results from the irvine  @xcite experiment will be analyzed considering the two energy bins that were reported in the original article .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sm ] we recall the basics of @xmath0 scattering in the context of the standard model , in sec .  [ sec : nsi ] we analyse the role of non - standard neutrino interactions and in sec .",
    "[ sec : res - fut ] we discuss prospects for further improvements , stressing the role of future low energy experiments using solar neutrino , as well as experiments using radioactive neutrino sources .",
    "as a warm - up exercise , before considering the case of non - standard neutrino interactions , let us briefly consider the restrictions placed by current experiments within the context of the standard model .      in the standard model the @xmath0 differential cross section scattering involves both neutral and charged currents and is well known  @xcite to be @xmath4 \\label{diff : cross : sec}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath5  gev  @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the electron mass , @xmath8 is the kinetic energy of the recoil electron and @xmath9 is the neutrino energy .",
    "one can see explicitly that the differential cross section in eq .",
    "( [ diff : cross : sec ] ) has a symmetry under the simultaneous transformation @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "apart from the last term , it is also invariant under separate sign changes in @xmath12 . for the case of @xmath1 scattering one has to exchange @xmath13 by @xmath14 .    for a fixed neutrino energy ,",
    "the determination of the weak coupling constants @xmath15 , is ambiguous since the same cross section in eq .",
    "( [ diff : cross : sec ] ) is achieved for any @xmath15 values in an ellipse with one axis given by @xmath16 and the other one by @xmath17 .",
    "however , measurements at different neutrino energies can potentially lift this degeneracy , due to the last term in eq .",
    "( [ diff : cross : sec ] ) .",
    "for example , for sufficiently low energies , comparable to the electron mass , the extra term rotates the ellipse by a sizable angle @xmath18    on the other hand , the anti - neutrino cross section defines another ellipse which is perpendicular to the one corresponding to the neutrino case , since the axis width of this ellipse is exactly opposite ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , by judicious combinations of energies and/or adding anti - neutrino data , one expects to lift the above degeneracy , as we will see in the next subsection .    within the standard model the coupling constants @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 are expressed , at tree level , as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the conventional sm definition .",
    "we have checked explicitly that for the present accuracy of the experiments , the above simple formulae are sufficient , as there is no sensitivity to the corresponding radiative corrections given in  @xcite .      in our global analysis of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering",
    "we have included all current experiments , namely , the data from the lsnd measurement of the neutrino electron scattering cross section  @xcite ; for the anti - neutrino electron scattering we have considered the two bins measured in the irvine experiment  @xcite , the results of the rovno experiment  @xcite and the more recent result from the munu experiment  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results are summarized in table  [ table:1 ] .    in order to perform the analysis we need the total cross section which , for the antineutrino case we express as @xmath23 where both spectra and the detector energy resolution function , should be convoluted with the cross sections given in eq .",
    "( [ diff : cross : sec ] ) .",
    "in particular for the most recent munu measurement from reactor neutrinos  @xcite , we use an anti - neutrino energy spectrum given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the abundance of @xmath26  @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29  @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32  @xmath30 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34  @xmath27 ( @xmath35 ) in the reactor , @xmath36 is the corresponding neutrino energy spectrum which we take from the parametrization given in  @xcite , with the appropriate fuel composition . for energies below @xmath37  mev",
    "there are only theoretical calculations for the antineutrino spectrum which we take from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the case of the irvine experiment",
    "we prefer to use the neutrino energy spectrum used by the experimentalists at that time  @xcite .",
    "regarding the detector resolution function @xmath38 for the case of munu it was found to be 8 % scaling with the power @xmath39 of the energy  @xcite .",
    "for the other two anti - neutrino experiments included in our analysis the resolution function was not reported , so we neglect resolution effects .",
    ".current experimental data on ( anti-)neutrino electron scattering . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the lsnd electron neutrino experiment we use the theoretical expectation for the total neutrino electron cross section , which is @xmath40.\\ ] ] notice that in this case the term @xmath41 can be neglected , since this experiment was done at high energies of tens of mev . as a result",
    "there is no tilt in the ellipse , as discussed in the previous section ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : global ] ) .    with this information",
    "we proceed to our @xmath42 analysis .",
    "altogether , we will have five observables , and therefore , it will be possible to constrain up to four parameters simultaneously .",
    "we neglect correlations between experiments ; this is a good approximation as the only possible correlation comes from the reactor neutrino energy spectrum , estimated to be less than 2%  @xcite , small in view of the statistical errors .",
    "therefore we can define the @xmath42 simply as @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are given by the measurements shown in table  [ table:1 ] and @xmath45 are the corresponding errors , while @xmath46 is the theoretical expectation .      in this section we present the results of our fit first in terms of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 coupling constants and , later",
    ", we will obtain the value of the standard model weak mixing angle .    to obtain the allowed regions for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 coupling constants",
    "we perform a @xmath42 analysis as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "these two parameters are determined by five measurements and therefore we will have three degrees of freedom .",
    "the minimun @xmath42 for this case was @xmath47 .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : global ] ) for @xmath48 % c l ( @xmath49 @xmath50 ) . in this case",
    "one can clearly notice the existence of four possible regions for these parameters .",
    "we overlay in the same figure the corresponding equi - cross section regions for current neutrino and anti - neutrino experiments , which form two perpendicular ellipses , as expected .",
    "the neutrino lsnd data gives rise to the horizontal ellipse , while the combined anti - neutrino data lead to the vertical ellipse and therefore reduce the allowed region by restricting the @xmath13 and @xmath14 values to the intersection of the two . of the existing experiments the ones giving the main contribution to the constraint are the lsnd and the irvine experiments , due to their higher statistics .",
    "a more restrictive analysis from the munu experiment might be possible by using its binned data , although this is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "( [ fig : global ] ) the case of a future low - energy neutrino experiment , in which case the ellipse is tilted . to illustrate the potential of future low energy experiments we consider , for definiteness , the case of the nostos proposal , where antineutrinos come from an intense tritium source with a maximum energy of 18.6 kev  @xcite . for this case the anti - neutrino spectrum for the source is taken as  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a normalization factor , @xmath53  kev , @xmath54 is the electron mass , and @xmath55 this spectrum is convoluted with the anti - neutrino differential cross section .",
    "the total number of events is set to be @xmath56  @xcite ( for one year of data taking ) .",
    "we see that there is room for such future low - energy neutrino experiments to provide useful input to resolve the current degenerate determination of the weak coupling constants , improving the existing measurements .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed above , the symmetry of the cross section when we make the transformations @xmath10 and @xmath11 can not be lifted by this method .",
    "such a degeneracy is therefore irreducible .",
    "this is not an academic ambiguity as it means the validity of the gauge theory description dictated by the standard model . in order to test the future sensitivity we set the experimental measure to be exactly the sm prediction , and we consider only the statistical error . after considering this experimental set up for nostos",
    "we obtain the region shown in figure 1 .    assuming the validity of the standard model , given by eqs .  ( [ glgr ] ) our results",
    "can also be presented directly in terms of the weak mixing angle . in this case",
    ", the combined analysis of the existing ( anti)-neutrino - electron scattering experiments gives @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding minimum for the @xmath42 function was @xmath58    the various contributions to @xmath59 from different individual experiments are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sin ] . note that the present fit gives a central value higher than the world average  @xcite , though the error is larger than found in other experiments , because of their small statistics relative to collider experiments .",
    "nevertheless we find this to be interesting as an independent and clean probe of the standard model .",
    "solar neutrino data are robust with respect to possible modifications in solar physics involving various types of magnetic fields both in the convective zone  @xcite as well as radiative zone  @xcite . if present , non - standard effects are expected to be sub  leading insofar as providing an explanation of the existing data  @xcite .",
    "however , even taking into account the crucial data from reactor experiments , the current accepted interpretation of solar neutrino data is not yet robust when neutrinos are endowed with non - standard interactions  @xcite .",
    "in fact it has been shown that the presence of nsi brings in an ambiguous determination of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters , with a new `` dark side '' solution ( with @xmath60  @xcite ) , essentially degenerate with the conventional one . similarly , despite the good description provided by oscillations of contained and upgoing events which leads to limits on the strength of the nsi strength in a two  neutrino scenario  @xcite , atmospheric neutrino data are still consistent with sizable values of the nsi parameters when three neutrinos are considered  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the case of terrestrial experiments involving electron ",
    "type neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "a model independent way of introducing such non standard interactions is via the effective four fermion lagrangian @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a first generation sm fermion : @xmath63 or @xmath64 , and @xmath65 or @xmath66 , are chiral projectors . with this lagrangian",
    "( [ lagrangian_nsi ] ) added to the standard model lagrangian one can compute the differential cross section for the process @xmath67 as    @xmath68\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this equation has six nsi parameters , two of them correspond to non - universal ( nu ) nsi : @xmath71 and four to flavor changing ( fc ) nsi : @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in view of the stringent ( though indirect ) constraints on the fc parameters",
    "@xmath74  @xcite we will , for simplicity , neglect fc nsi involvion muon neutrinos . this way we are left with the two nu nsi parameters and two fc parameters , @xmath73 .",
    "the agreement between @xmath0 scattering experiments and the standard model predictions had been previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to place restrictions on the magnitude of non - standard interactions .",
    "however , existing analyses either restricted the variation of the parameters , which were considered only one  at  a  time  @xcite , or the combination of two nsi parameters ( the non - universal coupling @xmath75 and @xmath75 ) but using only two experiments  @xcite .    here we revisit this question generalizing the conditions under which these constraints have been derived and , as we have already mentioned , updating the study through the inclusion of more recent data , such as the data from the munu experiment  @xcite . also for completeness",
    ", we will consider the results from the rovno reactor  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the results from the irvine experiment will be analyzed considering the two energy bins that were reported in the original article .",
    "although the constraints are expected to be weaker in our case , they will be robust than the ones obtained in the case where the parameters are taken only one  at  a time in the analysis .",
    "however , as will be clear at the end of this section , by taking full advantage of the combination of neutrino and anti - neutrino data we are able to obtain more stringent bounds on `` right - handed '' nsi parameters than previously .",
    "first we present the results for the case of non - universal nsi ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) , with flavour changing parameters set to zero . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : nu - nsi-2par ] ) we show the allowed regions at 90 , 95 and 99 % c l ( @xmath49  @xmath50 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath42 was 0.52 .",
    "one can see that its determination is improved with respect to the current results , although a twofold ambiguity in @xmath76 remains .",
    "this follows from the discussion given in section [ sec : sm ] , where we stressed that the intersection from the neutrino and anti - neutrino ellipses ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : global ] ) does not allow for a unique discrimination of the coupling constant values .",
    "it is here that future low energy experiments have a chance of improving their determination .",
    "the same analysis can be performed for the case where we allow only flavor changing nsi parameters ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , or for the general case when we take into account all four parameter simultaneously .",
    "the results of this analysis are summarized in table [ table : results ] .",
    "the left column collects previously reported constraints  @xcite , determined under the assumption that only one nsi parameter was allowed to take on nonzero values . in the second column , for comparison , we present the result of our fit for the same case of a one - parameter analysis .",
    "the third column gives our result for a two parameters analysis , where only nu or fc parameters are non - zero , therefore the nu region corresponds to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - nsi-2par ] . finally , the fourth column shows a more general case when from the four parameters we take a projection over two of them ( either nu or fc ) allowing the other two to take on non - zero values . in this case for a 90 % c l we have again to consider @xmath82 but the regions are wider as can be seen from the table .",
    "the minimum @xmath42 for this analysis was 0.49 .",
    "one can see that the constraints for the case when only one parameter is considered are similar to the results previously reported  @xcite , with the exception of @xmath83 and @xmath84 where ours are clearly better .",
    "this is natural to expect and follows from the fact that we are combining the lsnd neutrino electron scattering data with the anti - neutrino electron scattering data .",
    "this allows us to obtain four different regions for the left and right couplings as can also be seen from fig .",
    "( [ fig : global ] ) .",
    "it is important to note , however that when the four parameters are taken as freely - varying our constraints are weaker than the existing ones for the case of `` left - handed '' couplings @xmath85 and @xmath86 , as expected ( in fact they could be as large as order unity ) .",
    "in contrast , for the case of the `` right - handed '' nsi couplings , our constraints better than the previous limits .",
    "the explanation of this puzzle is that , in this case , in contrast to previous work , we combine neutrino and anti - neutrino data . as we have already seen , this has a great impact in constraining the `` right - handed '' nsi paramneters .",

    "we have presented a global analysis of non - standard neutrino interactions in electron ( anti)-neutrino scattering off electrons , including all current experiments , such as the most recent munu measurement from reactor neutrinos .",
    "we have discussed the resulting constraints both in the context of the standard model as well as extensions where non - standard neutrino interactions are present .",
    "we obtained constraints on non - universal and flavor changing nsi and compared our bounds with those obtained in previous analyses .",
    "we find that substantial room for improvement is expected from @xmath0 or @xmath1 low - energy scattering experiments .",
    "there are several proposals of this type , either using solar neutrinos , such as borexino  @xcite , or experiments using artificial neutrino sources , such as @xcite , that will be helpful in constrining nsi parameters as well as for other type of new physics ( see for example  @xcite ) . from the point of view of pinning down the interactions of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 low energy scattering experiments",
    "offer an alternative frontier that complements information that comes from higher energies  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "cross section measurements by themselves , at a given energy , lead to a degeneracy in the coupling constants and , therefore , in the determination of the nsi parameters .",
    "this degeneracy can be partially removed by considering both neutrino and anti - neutrino scattering off electrons .",
    "further improvements require low energy neutrino experiments .",
