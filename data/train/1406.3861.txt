    "data security in wireless systems has been dominated in the past by encryption methods like data encryption standard ( des ) and advanced encryption standard ( aes ) which have played very important roles in the security aspects of data transmission .",
    "however , these encryption algorithms suffer from high complexity and latency .",
    "this has motivated the investigation of novel secrecy techniques which can be implemented in the physical layer and which are under consideration to provide secure wireless transmission .    in the 1970s , wyner posed the alice - bob - eve problem and proposed the wire - tap transmission system in @xcite .",
    "the wire - tap transmission system gives a basic description on how to achieve the secrecy in the physical layer with better gaussian channels between users than the gaussian wire - tap channel .",
    "later on another study reported in @xcite showed that secrecy transmission is possible even when the eavesdropper has a better channel to the transmitter in a statistical sense than the receiver with confidential messages . the secrecy capacity @xcite for different kinds of channels , such as the gaussian wire - tap channel , the mimo wire - tap channels have been studied in @xcite and @xcite . in some later works @xcite , @xcite , it has been found that by adding artificial noise to the system the secrecy of the transmission can be further enhanced .      in recent years , precoding techniques have been widely applied to multi - user mimo systems .",
    "precoding techniques rely on pre - processing the transmitted data with the help of channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "different kinds of linear precoding techniques such as zero - forcing ( zf ) precoding , minimum mean square error ( mmse ) precoding and block diagonalization ( bd ) precoding are introduced in @xcite-@xcite , respectively .",
    "some non - linear precoding techniques like tomlinson - harashima precoding ( thp ) @xcite , vector perturbation ( vp ) precoding @xcite have also been reported .",
    "the precoding techniques can also contribute to the performance of relay systems @xcite these precoding techniques have been proven effective in improving the sum - rate and the bit - error rate ( ber ) performances .",
    "however , precoding strategies require csi at the transmit side , whereas in reality csi is available to the users of interest but is rarely available to the eavesdroppers . in most situations ,",
    "a designer only has access to imperfect csi for the users of interest . dealing with imperfect csi and the absence of csi of the eavesdropper is a major challenge .",
    "moreover , a technique that is particularly effective for improving the secrecy rate of physical - layer security is the introduction of artificial noise at the transmitter @xcite .      in this pape",
    "we propose a novel non - linear technique based on successive optimization tomlinson - harashima precoding ( so - thp ) and simplified generalized matrix inversion ( s - gmi ) techniques along with a strategy of injecting artificial noise prior to transmission .",
    "we also study precoding techniques for multi - user mimo systems under various conditions of csi between the access point and the users and the eavesdroppers .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed so - thp+s - gmi precoding technique outperforms existing non - linear and linear precoding algorithms in terms of physical layer secrecy rate performances .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and the performance metrics are given .",
    "the proposed so - thp+s - gmi precoding algorithm is introduced in section iii . in section iv , we discuss the simulation results .",
    "the conclusions are given in section v.    notation : bold uppercase letters @xmath0 denote matrices with size @xmath1 and bold lowercase letters @xmath2 denote column vectors with length @xmath3 .",
    "conjugate , transpose , and conjugate transpose are represented by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ; @xmath7 is the identity matrix of size @xmath8 ; @xmath9 denotes a diagonal matrix with the elements of the vector @xmath10 along its diagonal ; @xmath11 represents @xmath12 entries with zero mean and @xmath13 variance .",
    "in this section we introduce the system model considered for the transmission as well as the performance metrics that are used in the evaluation of the precoders .          here",
    "we consider an uncoded multi - user multiple input multiple output ( mu - mimo ) broadcast channel . at the acess point ( ap ) a transmitter with @xmath14 antennas is used to transmit @xmath15 users data steams .",
    "each user s data streams are received with @xmath16 receive antennas . along with the t users ,",
    "@xmath17 eavesdroppers each with @xmath18 receive antennas also receive data from the transmitter . in this system",
    "we assume the eavesdroppers do not jam the transmission and each user s or eavesdropper s channel is a flat - fading mimo channel .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 and @xmath20 corresponds to each user s or the eavesdropper s channel matrix .",
    "the gaussian noise with @xmath12 entries is distributed as @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in the scenarios without artificial noise , each user s or eavesdropper",
    "s received data are described by @xmath23 in ( [ eqn : yr ] ) @xmath24 is used to guarantee that the transmit power after precoding is the same as the original transmit power @xmath25 of user @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the precoding matrix .",
    "we use the vector @xmath28 to represent the signal after precoding . without artificial noise @xmath29",
    "is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the transmit symbols .    if the artificial noise is applied before the transmission , following the description in @xcite , the signal after precoding is given by @xmath32 where @xmath27 , @xmath33 are the precoding matrices .",
    "the vector @xmath31 represents the information to be transmitted .",
    "the vector @xmath34 is the jamming signal .",
    "suppose @xmath35 is the fraction of the power devoted to the information signal and @xmath36 . the artificial noise",
    "then should satisfy @xmath37 @xmath38 in ( [ eqn : eqs ] ) and ( [ eqn : trqs ] ) @xmath39 is the covariance matrix associated with the jamming signal @xmath40 .",
    "the covariance matrix of the transmit signal @xmath41 satisfies @xmath42 and proper artificial noise power ratio @xmath43 will result in an increase of the secrecy rate .",
    "based on the construction of the artificial noise , there will be a different effect on the secrecy rate performance . in @xcite",
    ", it shows a generalized artificial noise with more flexible covariance matrix to improve the secrecy rate . besides the construction introduced in @xcite ,",
    "the study in @xcite reports a system with a helping interferer to improve the achievable secrecy rate .      from @xcite-@xcite",
    ", we have the definition of the secrecy capacity as the maximum transmission rate alice can achieve during the transmission without any information detected by the eavesdropper . from @xcite without artificial noise",
    ", we have the secrecy capacity @xmath44 in ( [ eqn : cs ] ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the mutual information between the transmitter to the user as well as the eavesdropper .",
    "@xmath47 are the counterparts of different signal symbols .",
    "@xmath48 is the covariance matrix associated with the signal after precoding @xmath29 .",
    "the secrecy capacity achieved in this situation with prior knowledge of the users channel @xmath49 as well as the eavesdroppers channel @xmath50 can be used as a benchmark for further study . in reality",
    "the channel between the transmitter and the eavesdroppers is not perfectly known .",
    "this situation known as the imperfect csi is discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , for the imperfect csi @xmath50 we suppose the distribution of the eavesdroppers channel is known to the transmitter and users .    another performance metric is the ber estimated by the different links . ideally , we would like the users to experience a reliable communication and the eavesdropper to have a very high ber ( virtually no reliability when communicating ) . in this paper ,",
    "different precoding techniques are supposed to suppress the interferences between different users thus leading to a better ber performance .",
    "thirdly , the algorithm computational complexity should also take into consideration . with the increasing of the number of users",
    ", the high computational complexity algorithm will suffer from a long time delay .",
    "low computational complexity will contribute to reduce the latency of the system .",
    "in this section , we detail the proposed precoding algorithms .      according to @xcite , we assume the modified date symbol vector @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . with the feedback matrix",
    "we can then obtain the output of the modulo operation @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "when we have the feedforward matrix @xmath57 , the transmit signal can be obtained as @xmath58 . where @xmath59 the received signal @xmath60",
    "then can be written in the following form : @xmath61 in @xcite , the so - thp algorithm is illustrated as a combination of a successive optimization technique and tomlinson - harashima precoding . the reordered feedforward and feedback matrices are expressed as @xmath62 @xmath63_{ii}^{-1}\\right)\\right ) \\label{eqn : bmatrix}\\ ] ] where the complex unitary matrix @xmath64 .",
    "the concept of generalized matrix inversion precoding has been introduced in @xcite , where two approaches called generalized zero - forcing channel inversion ( gzi ) and generalized mmse channel inversion ( gmi ) are illustrated .",
    "the gmi scheme uses the qr decomposition to decompose the mmse channel inversion @xmath65 as expressed by @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and gmi takes the noise into account .",
    "it overcomes the noise enhancement in the bd algorithm .",
    "meanwhile extra interference may be introduced in the following steps . to solve this problem , a transmit combining matrix @xmath71",
    "is applied to @xmath72 . under the total transmit power constraint we use the minimum total mse criterion to achieve the transmit combining matrix @xmath71 . in @xcite",
    "the transmit combining matrix @xmath71 is given by @xmath73 as described by @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "once we have @xmath72 and @xmath71 , the following approach is @xmath77 in @xcite , it has been shown that the transmit combining matrix @xmath78 is not necessary .",
    "therefore , a simplified gmi ( s - gmi ) is developed in @xcite as an improvement of the original rbd precoding in @xcite .",
    "this is known as s - gmi .",
    "therefore , the decomposition in ( [ eqn : trsvd ] ) , the precoder and the receive filter are @xmath79 @xmath80 , \\label{eqn : psgmi}\\ ] ] @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 . in the so - thp+s - gmi algorithm , the feedforward matrix ( [ eqn : fmatrix ] ) is obtained by reordering the s - gmi precoding matrix ( [ eqn : psgmi ] ) .",
    "a system with @xmath84 transmit antennas and @xmath85 users as well as @xmath86 eavesdroppers is considered .",
    "all the transmitted symbols are modulated with qpsk . in the simulations , we assume that the channel for each user is uncorrelated and is generated following a complex gaussian model with zero mean and variance equal to one .      in assessing the computational complexity , the number of flops ( floating - point operations per second ) is used as a measurement of the cost of an algorithm . in @xcite , the flops for real qr , svd and complex qr algorithms are given . according to @xcite for an @xmath87 complex matrix @xmath88 ,",
    "the flops of the svd of the complex matrix @xmath88 are equivalent to its @xmath89 extended real matrix .",
    "the number of flops of the multiplication , the qr decomposition , the matrix inversion as well as svd with different matrices obtained have been reported in @xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : com ] it is shown that although the bd precoding algorithm has the lowest complexity , its ber and secrecy rate performances are not satisfactory . among the so - thp type algorithms",

    "[ fig:444ip ] , the secrecy rate performance is evaluated in the imperfect csi scenario , which shows a degradation at low snr .",
    "furthermore , the secrecy rate requires a very high snr to converge to a high secrecy rate .",
