    "recently , many studies have been devoted to fractal structures induced by the chaotic dynamics in the phase - space of non - equilibrium statistical systems and , in particular , to the fractal character of the hydrodynamic modes governing the exponential relaxation of the system to the thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this fractal character has been related to the entropy production in the approach of equilibrium , for a diffusive multibaker model @xcite .",
    "previous works had shown similar results for the entropy production in non - equilibrium steady states @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the fractal dimension characterizing the hydrodynamic modes of diffusion has been related to the diffusion coefficient and to the positive lyapunov exponent by a relation , first obtained for diffusive multibaker maps @xcite , and proved for general chaotic systems with two degrees of freedom @xcite . the construction of the hydrodynamic modes in refs .",
    "@xcite gives us a new approach to relate macroscopic transport coefficients and microscopic chaotic properties .",
    "it establishes a link between the irreversible transport processes and the reversible microscopic dynamics .",
    "two other approaches are the so - called escape rate formalism and the thermostated system approach . the first approach can be applied to open systems with absorbing boundaries @xcite .",
    "the escape of trajectories leads to the formation of a fractal repeller , consisting in the set of orbits forever trapped within the absorbing boundaries . under such conditions",
    ", the transport properties can be related to the positive lyapunov exponents and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy per unit time as well as to fractal dimensions @xcite . in the second approach , an external field",
    "is applied to the system , and in order to keep the kinetic energy constant , a special force acts on the particles as a heat pump @xcite .",
    "the system is still time - reversible but does not preserve phase - space volumes anymore .",
    "the trajectories converge to a fractal attractor . in thermostated systems ,",
    "the transport properties have been related to the sum of lyapunov exponents @xcite . in the new approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , the advantage is that the fractal curve considered is directly related to the hydrodynamic modes of relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it does not require absorbing boundaries neither a thermostat .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the new approach of refs .",
    "@xcite to reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "reaction - diffusion processes are of fundamental importance to understand self - organization in physico - chemical systems @xcite . in chemical systems , the microscopic mechanisms of the relaxation toward the thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "are still poorly understood already for simple reactions . for the purpose of contributing to this important question ,",
    "we consider here a simple reactive process of isomerization . the particle is supposed to perform a deterministic motion among static scatterers and to carry a color @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "when colliding on some special scatterers , playing the role of catalysts , its color changes instantaneously with a given probability @xmath2 , @xmath3 for this class of systems , we obtain an expression of the hausdorff dimension of the reactive modes of relaxation in terms of the reactive dispersion relation and of a function @xmath4 generalizing the ruelle topological pressure @xmath5 . in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "we then infer a relation between the hausdorff dimension of the modes , the reactive diffusion coefficient , the reaction rate , and two derivatives of the function @xmath4 . in the limit @xmath6",
    ", we recover a relation previously derived for the diffusive case @xcite .",
    "this new expression relates the macroscopic transport and reaction processes to the microscopic underlying dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we generalize the work of refs .",
    "@xcite to the reactive case considered here . in section [ triadic ] ,",
    "we test our relation on a reactive multibaker model .",
    "we next study the case of a two - dimensional periodic reactive lorentz gas in section [ lorentz ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a system such as a lorentz gas in which the particles move independently of each other along trajectories of a deterministic dynamical system given by @xmath7 the variables of this system are for instance the positions and velocities of the particle : @xmath8 .",
    "the vector field @xmath9 is defined in this space .",
    "the system is spatially periodic in the positions @xmath10 .",
    "the particle moves in a periodic lattice of scatterers given by a certain potential of interaction .    moreover , each particle carries a color which is either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the color changes when the particle interacts with some of the scatterers , called the catalytic scatterers according to the reaction ( [ scheme ] ) .",
    "we notice that we may also consider that the particle has a spin one - half which flips upon collision on special scatterers .",
    "we can model the reactive events by a change of color with probability @xmath2 when the trajectory meets a certain hypersurface @xmath11 defined in the space of the variables @xmath12 .",
    "this hypersurface surrounds each catalytic scatterer and constitutes the locus where the reaction occurs .",
    "the introduction of the color has for consequence that the phase space is composed of two copies of the space of the variables @xmath12 , which are glued together along the hypersurface @xmath13 .",
    "this hypersurface can be viewed as the gate from copy corresponding to the color @xmath0 to the one corresponding to color @xmath1 and vice versa .",
    "these two copies now form two subspaces of the whole phase space of the reactive system . in this framework",
    ", a reactive event corresponds to the crossing of the hypersurface @xmath13 from one color subspace to the other .",
    "a statistical ensemble of particles of both colors is described by two probability densities @xmath14 and @xmath15 , to find a particle at the point @xmath12 with color @xmath16 or @xmath1 , at the current time @xmath17",

    "the distribution ( [ distrib ] ) expresses the fact that the particles change their color upon crossing of the hypersurface @xmath13 .",
    "accordingly , the probability densities just after the hypersurface @xmath13 in the direction of the vector field @xmath22 are the following linear combinations of the densities just before @xmath13 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 and an arbitrarily small @xmath26 . these linear combinations can be expressed in terms of the transmission matrix @xmath27    we denote by @xmath28 the trajectory of the differential equation ( [ diffeq ] ) from the initial condition @xmath29 . moreover , we gather both probability densities in the vector @xmath30 the solution of the coupled liouville equations ( [ liouville ] ) from the initial probability densities @xmath31 can then be written in the form of the following frobenius - perron operator : @xmath32 with the matrix ( [ transitionmatrix ] ) and where @xmath33 is the number of crossings through the hypersurface @xmath13 performed by the segment of trajectory from @xmath34 to @xmath28 . if the flow of eq .  ( [ diffeq ] ) is volume preserving , we have that @xmath35 which implies that @xmath36 , which is the case for the systems considered in the following .",
    "the system of liouville s equations ( [ liouville ] ) defines a random process and it is important to characterize the dynamical randomness generated by this process . for this purpose , we calculate its kolmogorov - sinai entropy per unit time which is the amount of information produced per unit time by the process .",
    "the kolmogorov - sinai entropy is calculated by partitioning the whole phase space into small cells and by computing the probability for a trajectory to visit successively different cells of the partition @xcite .",
    "if we suppose that the differential equation ( [ diffeq ] ) defines a chaotic dynamical system with lyapunov exponents @xmath37 , the dynamical instability of the deterministic motion is a first contribution to the kolmogorov - sinai entropy given by the sum of positive lyapunov exponents according to pesin s theorem @xcite .",
    "a second contribution comes from the random change of color upon crossing of the hypersurface @xmath13 . at each crossing",
    ", the particle jumps from one color subspace to the other with probability @xmath2 . if the number of crossings is equal to @xmath38 during the lapse of time @xmath17 , the frequency of @xmath13 crossings is equal to : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the average with respect to the equilibrium state . at each crossing",
    ", we have an independent dichotomous random variable with probabilities @xmath41 , which defines a bernoulli process with the rate @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , the overall kolmogorov - sinai entropy per unit time of the process ( [ liouville ] ) is given by @xmath43 .",
    "\\label{ks}\\ ] ] pesin s expression of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy is recovered in the deterministic limits @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    for @xmath46 , we remark that the kolmogorov - sinai entropy ( [ ks ] ) remains positive and finite as for a fully deterministic dynamical system .",
    "the way the reaction is modelled here is therefore compatible with a deterministic dynamics that would take place near each catalytic scatterer on a time scale much shorter than the free flight between each scatterer .",
    "we can imagine that the reaction follows a complicated trajectory on such a short time scale in a complicated potential , which is here simplified by capturing the complexity of the reaction into a sole transition probability @xmath2 .",
    "still the so - defined random process has a finite kolmogorov - sinai entropy contrary to stochastic processes which have an infinite kolmogorov - sinai entropy per unit time .",
    "indeed , it has been shown elsewhere @xcite that stochastic processes such as the birth - and - death processes or the linearized boltzmann processes have a dynamical randomness on arbitrarily small scales @xmath47 with an @xmath47-entropy per unit time increasing as @xmath48 .",
    "stochastic processes defined by langevin stochastic differential equations have an even larger dynamical randomness with an @xmath47-entropy per unit time increasing as @xmath49 .",
    "the kolmogorov - sinai entropy is the supremum of the @xmath47-entropy in the limit @xmath50 and is therefore infinite .",
    "in contrast with such stochastic processes , the present random process has a finite kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "this dynamical randomness is comparable with the randomness of the classical dynamics on graphs which has been recently characterized @xcite . for the classical graphs ,",
    "the motion is one - dimensional so that the only source of randomness is the random bifurcations at the vertices of the graph . here",
    ", there is an extra source of randomness which is the dynamical instability due to the chaotic motion of the particle in the multi - dimensional phase space of eq .",
    "( [ diffeq ] ) .",
    "the overall dynamical randomness ( [ ks ] ) induces a relaxation of the probability densities toward the thermodynamic equilibrium . in order to study this relaxation we have to find the relaxation rates which are given by the eigenvalues of the frobenius - perron operator ( [ fpmatrix ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the liouville equations ( [ liouville ] ) can be decoupled if we introduce the probability density @xmath51 to find a particle at the point @xmath12 no matter which is its color , and the difference @xmath52 between both color densities : @xmath53 these new functions are gathered in the vector @xmath54 which is related to the previous vector ( [ qaqb ] ) by the relation @xmath55 in terms of the matrix @xmath56 this matrix diagonalizes the transition matrix ( [ transitionmatrix ] ) into @xmath57 accordingly , the liouville equations ( [ liouville ] ) decouple into @xmath58 = 0\\ , \\cr \\partial_t \\ ; g({\\bf x},t ) + { \\rm div}\\left[{\\bf f}({\\bf x } ) \\ ; g({\\bf x},t ) \\right ] = -2p_0\\ , \\xi \\left[\\sigma({\\bf x})\\right ] g({\\bf x},t)\\ . \\cr } \\label{newliouville}\\ ] ] which shows that the probability density @xmath51 obeys the deterministic liouville equation while the difference @xmath52 solely controls the reaction .",
    "similarly , the frobenius - perron operator ( [ fpmatrix ] ) splits in the two following operators : @xmath59    an eigenvalue problem can now be considered separately for both operators ( [ opdiff ] ) and ( [ opreac ] ) . if we denote them generically by @xmath60 , we are looking for eigenstates given by some distributions which are quasiperiodic in the position space @xmath10 with a wavenumber @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is periodic in @xmath10 .",

    "the quantity @xmath66 is the relaxation rate of the eigenstate ( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "the idea is that these eigenstates can be obtained in principle by applying the operator @xmath60 over a long time to some expression ( [ eigen ] ) and by renormalizing the result in order to compensate the relaxation according to @xmath67 \\label{limit}\\ ] ] even starting from some arbitrary function @xmath68 .",

    "we study the limit of small wavenumbers and small reaction probabilities .",
    "the agreement with the theory is excellent .",
    "moreover , the study confirms and clarifies results previously obtained for similar models of reaction - diffusion @xcite .",
    "in particular , our results confirm that the reaction - diffusion process will obey on a large spatial scale and a long time scale the macroscopic reaction - diffusion equations : @xmath353 for the color densities @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "according to results ( [ drp0 ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) , the diffusion coefficients of eqs .  ( [ eqb ] ) are given by @xmath356 which explains that the coefficients of cross - diffusion can be small if the transition probability @xmath2 is small .",
    "( [ delta ] ) shows that this cross - diffusion depends on the correlation between the number @xmath38 of catalysts encountered and the square @xmath357 of the distance travelled by the particle in its diffusive motion .",
    "moreover , figs .",
    "[ drvsl ] and [ drlor ] and eqs .",
    "( [ diffreacp0 ] ) and ( [ diffreacl ] ) for the multibaker model show that the coefficient of cross - diffusion can become significant for high transition probability @xmath2 and if the density of catalysts is very high , in the case @xmath203 for the multibaker and @xmath293 for the lorentz gas .",
    "we may here say that the cross - diffusion , i.e. the coupling between the diffusions of colors @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is induced by the reaction .",
    "in conclusion , the modes of relaxation toward equilibrium turn out to display unexpected fractal properties which have their origin in the chaotic dynamics of the microscopic motion of particles , even if this motion is time - reversal symmetric and volume - preserving .",
    "this result has been previously obtained for diffusive processes and , here , we have shown that this result extends to reaction - diffusion systems where it allows us to understand the relaxation to equilibrium at the level of the microscopic motion",
