    "a da type @xmath1 is composed of a compact and degenerate carbon / oxygen ( c / o ) core and a very thin helium ( he ) layer covered by a thinner hydrogen ( h ) atmosphere . at the bottom of the @xmath1 cooling curve , there is an instability stripe basically from 12270k to 10850k ( gianninas et al .",

    "the average surface h atmosphere is thinner than previous predicted value of @xmath0 = @xmath4 .",

    "( 2005 ) suggested that a large fraction of bpm 37093 was likely to be crystallized .",
    "above all , the asteroseismological studies on dav stars are significant and meaningful .",
    "dav stars are @xmath9-mode pulsators .",
    "gravity acts as restoring force .",
    "an eigen - mode can be expressed by three indices ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "they are the radial order , the spherical harmonic degree , and the azimuthal number respectively .",
    "the radial order @xmath10 describes the nodes of standing wave inside a star , which can not be identified observationally .",
    "according to an asymptotic theory for @xmath9-modes ( tassoul 1980 ) , modes with same @xmath11 and consecutive @xmath10 ( high values ) have an asymptotic period spacing as @xmath13 in eq.(1 ) , @xmath14 is brunt - visl frequency and @xmath15 is stellar radius .",
    "the eq.(1 ) is valid when radial orders are sufficiently high .",
    "if mode trapping effects are negligible and ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) values can be identified , the relative radial orders for @xmath12 = 0 modes with same @xmath11 can be counted under the linear approximations .",
    "the spherical harmonic degree @xmath11 of some mode can be identified according to a frequency splitting relation .",
    "a pulsating mode will split into several components in frequency because of stellar rotation .",
    "brickhill ( 1975 ) reported an approximate formula between frequency splitting ( @xmath16 ) and rotational period ( @xmath17 ) under the asymptotic regime as @xmath18 in eq.(2 ) , the azimuthal number @xmath12 can be taken from @xmath19 to @xmath11 , totally 2@xmath11 + 1 different values .",
    "modes with @xmath11 = 1 will form a triplet and modes with @xmath11 = 2 will form a quintuplet . therefore ,",
    "if triplets or quintuplets are derived from observations for a pulsating star , the spherical harmonic degree @xmath11 will be identified as 1 or 2 preferentially to some extent .",
    "sometimes , three middle components of quintuplets are detected , which will confuse the @xmath11 identifications .",
    "normal @xmath9-modes are global to the star which pulsate within its entire body .",
    "winget et al . (",
    "1981 ) proposed that compositional stratified zone rapidly produced by gravity sedimentation may form a resonance .",
    "some modes would be trapped in the resonance .",
    "they were called trapped modes .",

    "they reported , as expected in the context of the trace element approximation of equilibrium profiles ( tassoul et al .",
    "1990 ) , that mode trapping properties were stronger when compared with composition profiles obtained at , or near , diffusion equilibrium .",
    "dav stars have low luminosity which is basically less than 1% of that for the sun ( @xmath25 @xmath26 -2 ) .",
    "usually only a few modes are observed for dav stars .",
