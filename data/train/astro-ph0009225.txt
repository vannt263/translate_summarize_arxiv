    "despite intensive observational campaigns , no irrefutable identification of an isolated accreting neutron star ( ns ) has been presented so far .",
    "six soft sources have been found in rosat fields which are most probably associated to isolated radioquiet nss .",
    "present x - ray and optical data however do not allow an unambiguous identification of the physical mechanism responsible for their emission .",
    "these sources can be powered either by accretion of the interstellar gas onto old ( @xmath6 yr ) nss or by the release of internal energy in relatively young ( @xmath7 yr ) cooling nss ( see treves et al .",
    "@xcite and motch @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the rosat candidates , although relatively bright ( up to @xmath8 ) , are intrinsically dim and their inferred luminosity ( @xmath9 ) is near to that expected from either a close - by cooling ns or from an accreting ns among the most luminous .",
    "their x - ray spectrum is soft and thermal , again as predicted for both accretors and coolers ( zane , turolla & treves @xcite ; treves et al .",
    "@xcite ) . up to now",
    "only two optical counterparts have been identified ( rxj 1856 , walter & matthews @xcite , for which a distance estimate of @xmath10 pc has been very recently obtained , walter @xcite , and rxj 0720 , kulkarni & van kerkwick @xcite ) . in both cases an optical excess over the low - frequency tail of the black body x - ray spectrum has been reported .",
    "while detailed multiwavelength observations with next - generation instruments may indeed be the key for assessing the true nature of these sources , other , indirect , approaches may be used to discriminate in favor of one of the two scenarios proposed so far .    in this _",
    "letter _ we compute and compare the @xmath11  @xmath12 distribution of both accreting and cooling nss , to establish the relative contribution of the two populations to the observed number counts .",
    "previous studies derived the @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 distribution of accretors ( treves & colpi @xcite ; madau and blaes @xcite ; manning et al .",
    "@xcite ) assuming a nss velocity distribution rich in slow stars ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "more recent measurements of pulsar velocities ( e.g. lyne & lorimer @xcite ; hansen & phinney @xcite ) and upper limits on the observed number of accretors in rosat surveys ( danner @xcite , @xcite ) point , however , to a larger ns mean velocity ( see treves et al .",
    "@xcite for a critical discussion ) .",
    "recently nehauser & trmper ( @xcite , nt99 hereafter ) compared the number count distribution of the rosat isolated ns candidates with those of accretors and coolers .",
    "here we address these issues in greater detail , also in the light of the latest contributions to the modeling of the evolution of galactic nss ( popov et al .",
    "@xcite , p2000 hereafter ) . in @xmath14 we use a population synthesis model , developed in p2000 , to trace the properties of the ns spin , magnetic field and accretion luminosity in the galactic potential using a detailed map of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "cooling nss are explored separately in @xmath15 within a simpler model of local sources .",
    "results are discussed in @xmath16 .",
    "the census model adopted here follows closely that developed in p2000 .",
    "all nss are born in the galactic plane , their birth rate is taken to be proportional to the square of the ism density and is constant in time .",
    "initially a ns has a circular velocity fixed by its position in the galactic plane and determined by the galactic potential . to this , an additional kick velocity with random orientation and modulus selected from a maxwellian distribution is imparted .",
    "time resolution is adapted to follow in detail the different evolutionary phases the star experiences .",
    "nss are born in the ejector ( e ) phase and then , as braking due to electromagnetic torques increases the period , come to the propeller ( p ) phase .",
    "further spin - down , produced by accretion torques , may drive the star in the accretion ( a ) phase when matter can penetrate the magnetosphere reaching the stellar surface ( see e.g. lipunov @xcite ) .",
    "accretion is then assumed to proceed at the local bondi rate and the large scale ism distribution is mapped as in p2000 .",
    "the small scale structure of the ism ( @xmath17au-1 pc , see e.g. meyer & lauroesh @xcite ; treves et al .",
    "@xcite ) , has not been taken into account as it would produce an unacceptable increase of the computing time , leading to a worse statistics .",
    "a detailed mapping of the ism on all scales is fundamental in assessing the observability of single , luminous sources ( see zane et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but the effects produced by its multiphase structure on the evolution of the entire ns population are likely to average out .    here",
    "we consider only the simplest picture , where the star magnetic field is constant and the dipole moment @xmath18 has a log - gaussian distribution , similar to that observed in radiopusars ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 in cgs units ) .",
    "the magneto - rotational evolution is followed using essentially the same approach as in p2000 .",
    "in particular , the typical values of the transition periods are @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s for e@xmath23 p and p@xmath23 a transitions , respectively .",
    "as soon as the star enters the accretor stage , the period is set to the value typical of an accretor embedded in a turbulent medium ( lipunov & popov @xcite ; konenkov & popov @xcite ) .",
    "the statistics of accretors was improved by a factor @xmath24 relative to p2000 by evolving only stars from the low - velocity tail ( @xmath25 km s@xmath26 ) of a maxwellian with @xmath27 km s@xmath26 .",
    "this assumption appears justified since the time spent in the ejector phase increases with velocity , @xmath28 the present choice for @xmath29 follows from radiopulsar observations and current limits on the detection of accreting nss ( p2000 ) .",
    "results can be easily scaled to any @xmath30 km s@xmath26 .",
    "nearly all highly magnetized isolated nss in the velocity range considered here become accretors , and in calculating the @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 distribution we obtain good statistics for fluxes @xmath31 erg @xmath1 s@xmath26 . at larger",
    "fluxes the number of sources is too small to give reliable counts , but the extrapolation @xmath32 can be safely used for @xmath33 .",
    "our main results are presented in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] , and refer to a total of @xmath34 nss in the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 distribution of accretors is computed for sources within a distance of 5 kpc , together with the distributions of velocity , accretion rate and effective temperature ( calculated adopting as effective surface the polar cap area ) .",
    "isolated nss with fields @xmath35 g never appear as accretors in any run .",
    "the brightest accretors have luminosities @xmath36 erg s@xmath26 , but for the majority of them @xmath37 erg s@xmath26 .",
    "our sources are relatively hot , with a mean effective temperature 300 - 400 ev and for them absorption can be neglected .",
    "we predict , on average , about 1 source per square degree , in the energy range 0.5 - 2 kev , for limiting fluxes about @xmath38@xmath39 erg @xmath1 s@xmath26 .",
    "this implies @xmath40 sources in the whole sky .",
    "note that they are significantly concentrated toward the galactic plane with a center - anticenter asymmetry .",
    "soon after their birth in a type ii supernova event , cooling nss emit x - ray luminosities as high as @xmath41 erg s@xmath26 for a few thousands years . before disappearing from the x - ray sky",
    ", they shine as faint soft sources ( @xmath42 erg s@xmath26 ) for about a million year ( e.g. yakovlev et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the determination of the log@xmath43-log@xmath44",
    ", the cooler sample should in principle be drawn from the same parent population as accretors . however , as their total number is quite low ( @xmath45 of the total number of ns in the galaxy ) owing to the short duration of the cooling phase , the results would be affected by the very poor statistics .",
    "notice however that coolers can travel only a distance @xmath46 pc during their lifetime and have softer spectra than accretors , so they appear mostly as a local population of sources ( due to interstellar absorption ) .    for this reason , we prefer to approximate their spatial distribution around the sun as homogeneous with a scale height of @xmath47 pc .",
    "we take cooling nss as `` standard candles '' with @xmath48 erg s@xmath26 , giving off a black - body spectrum with effective temperature @xmath49 ev .",
    "the duration of the cooling phase is taken to be @xmath50 yr , according to the `` slow cooling '' scenario ( see nt99 ) .",
    "we used two typical values for the total ns spatial density : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the former estimate follows from radiopulsar statistics and was used by nt99 , while the latter corresponds to a total population of @xmath34 nss , as implied by constraints on nucleosynthetic yields and historic supernova rates ( arnett et al . @xcite ; van den bergh & tammann @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , coolers have a mean density of @xmath53    the ism structure is treated in a very simple way .",
    "the ism density inside the local bubble of radius @xmath54 ( sfeir et al .",
    "@xcite ) is @xmath55 @xmath56 . at larger distances",
    "the interstellar gas is assumed to be uniformly distributed in a disk of half - thickness 450 pc with @xmath57 @xmath56 .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig2 ] , where we compare the observed distribution of rosat candidates with that of coolers , as predicted by the present model ( including absorption ) and by nt99 , the latter obtained for a total ns number @xmath58 . as it is apparent ,",
    "coolers dominate over accretors at large fluxes ( for the same @xmath59 ) , essentially because of their much higher luminosity ( @xmath60 vs. @xmath61 erg s@xmath26 ) .",
    "this simple model reproduces the most important feature , the `` flattening '' of the @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 distribution outside the local bubble .",
    "such strong flattening can help to explain the observed data , if one assumes that most of the brightest isolated nss are identified ( schwope et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the value of the flux at which the distribution flattens out ( the `` knee '' ) depends on the size of the local bubble @xmath62 the ism densities and the duration of the cooling time affect instead the number of sources . since the cooling time can be an important parameter , the comparison of theoretical and observed distributions could , in principle , help in discriminating between `` fast '' and `` slow '' cooling models .",
    "the statistical analysis presented in the previous sections shows that both scenarios , accretors and coolers , have difficulties in explaining , under usual assumptions , the observed properties of isolated ns rosat candidates .",
    "the main problem is to produce enough sources that are , at the same time : i ) relatively bright ( high count rates , @xmath63 cts s@xmath26 ) ; ii ) close ( low absorption @xmath64 ) ; iii ) soft ( @xmath65 ev ) ; iv ) slowly rotating ( for two candidates , rx j0720 and rx j0420 , the detected periods are 8.4 and 22.7 s ) .    polar cap accretion for a non - decaying magnetic field , @xmath66 g , can not produce enough bright sources and the emitted spectrum is likely to be harder , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "moreover , accretors are expected to have much larger periods , @xmath67 s. on the other hand , relatively young cooling nss can be spun down to periods @xmath68 s in @xmath69 yrs ( when they are still hot ) only for @xmath70 g , since @xmath71 for dipole losses .",
    "if all nss experience an initial radiopulsar phase , their total number in the galaxy would be about @xmath72 ( lyne et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    "there will be not bright enough isolated nss in the solar vicinity in both scenarios .",
    "if @xmath73 , coolers can explain the large number of bright close - by sources and their typical temperatures ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , the problem of reproducing the observed periods still remains , unless the progenitors of the rosat pulsating candidates are nss born with long periods , which never passed through the pulsar phase ; alternatively they could be magnetars with ultra - high fields , as suggested by heyl & kulkarni ( @xcite ) .",
    "if proved correct , the `` fast '' cooling scenario , in which the duration of the active x - ray phase is shorter , would make again problematic to account for the observed bright sources .    in the accretion scenario ,",
    "increasing the total number of nss is also a need . as already shown by livio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and colpi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , magnetic field decay can explain the low temperatures and periods .",
    "decay can both increase and decrease number of accreting isolated nss ( popov , & prokhorov @xcite ) .",
    "but a complete statistical analysis is still to come .    in any case , using `` standard '' assumptions on the velocity , spin period and magnetic field parameters , the accretion scenario can not explain the observed properties of the six rosat candidates .",
    "note that the number of accretors ( of all luminosities ) in the galaxy is found to be about two orders of magnitude larger than the number of young coolers : few percents versus 0.01% of the total number of isolated nss .",
    "but on average accretors are 3 orders of magnitude fainter than a typical cooler .",
    "a key result of our statistical analysis is that accretors should eventually become more abundant than coolers at fluxes below @xmath74 erg @xmath1 s@xmath26 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] in which we summarize the main outcome of our simulations .",
