    "the discovery of a higgs boson with mass around 125 gev  @xcite is the main highlight of the run - i phase of the lhc , as it provides the first experimental evidence of the higgs mechanism  @xcite .",
    "although the measured couplings of the discovered higgs boson show remarkable compatibility with those predicted by the standard model ( sm )  @xcite , the current experimental data still leave open the possibility of an extended higgs sector .",
    "in fact , several well - motivated new - physics scenarios necessarily come with an enlarged higgs sector , such as supersymmetry  @xcite and axion models  @xcite , in order to address a number of theoretical and cosmological issues , including the gauge hierarchy problem , the origin of the dark matter ( dm ) and matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe . here",
    "we consider the simplest extension of the standard higgs mechanism , namely the two higgs doublet model  ( 2hdm )  @xcite , where the sm higgs doublet is supplemented by another isodoublet with hypercharge @xmath0 .",
    "this model can provide new sources of spontaneous  @xcite or explicit  @xcite cp violation , viable dm candidates  @xcite and a strong first order phase transition for electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .    in the doublet field space @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , the general 2hdm potential reads @xmath3 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\lambda_1(\\phi_1^\\dag \\phi_1)^2+\\lambda_2(\\phi_2^\\dag \\phi_2)^2    + \\lambda_3(\\phi_1^\\dag \\phi_1)(\\phi_2^\\dag \\phi_2 )    + \\lambda_4(\\phi_1^\\dag \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^\\dag \\phi_1 )",

    "thus , the vacuum structure of the general 2hdm can be quite rich  @xcite , as compared to the sm .",
    "the quark - sector yukawa lagrangian in the general 2hdm is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the isospin conjugates of @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the @xmath13 quark doublet and @xmath14 are right - handed quark singlets . due to the yukawa interactions in",
    ", the neutral scalar bosons often induce unacceptably large flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes at the tree level .",
    "this is usually avoided by imposing a discrete @xmath15 symmetry  @xcite under which @xmath16 ( @xmath17 being the quark family index ) so that only @xmath18 gives mass to up - quarks , and only @xmath19 or only @xmath18 gives mass to down - quarks . in this case , the scalar boson couplings to quarks are proportional to the quark mass matrix , as in the sm , and therefore , there is no tree - level fcnc process .",
    "the @xmath15 symmetry   is satisfied by four discrete choices of tree - level yukawa couplings between the higgs doublets and sm fermions , which are known as type i , ii , x ( lepton - specific ) and y ( flipped ) 2hdms  @xcite . in type ii , x and y 2hdm , both higgs doublets @xmath1 acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath20 , whereas in type i 2hdm , one of the higgs doublets ( @xmath19 ) does not couple to the sm fermions and need not acquire a vev  @xcite .",
    "global fits to the current lhc higgs data  @xcite suggest that all four types of discrete 2hdm are constrained to lie close to the so - called sm _ alignment limit _",
    ", where the mass eigenbasis of the cp - even scalar sector aligns with the sm gauge eigenbasis . naively , the sm alignment is often associated with the decoupling limit , in which all the non - standard higgs bosons are assumed to be much heavier than the electroweak scale so that the lightest cp - even scalar behaves just like the sm higgs boson .",
    "this sm alignment limit can also be achieved , without decoupling  @xcite . however , for small @xmath21 values , this is usually attributed to accidental cancellations in the 2hdm potential  @xcite . here",
    "we present a symmetry argument to naturally justify the alignment limit  @xcite , independently of the kinematic parameters of the theory , such as the heavy higgs masses and the ratio of the vevs ( @xmath22 ) . in the 2hdms where both higgs doublets acquire vevs ,",
    "we show that there exist only _ three _ possible symmetry realizations of the scalar potential having natural alignment .",
    "we explicitly analyze the simplest case , namely the maximally symmetric 2hdm ( ms-2hdm ) with so(5 ) symmetry .",
    "we show that the renormalization group ( rg ) effects due to the hypercharge gauge coupling @xmath23 and third - generation yukawa couplings , as well as soft - breaking mass parameters , induce relevant deviations from the so(5 ) limit , which lead to distinct predictions for the higgs spectrum of the ms-2hdm .",
    "in particular , the heavy higgs sector is predicted to be _ quasi - degenerate _ , which is a distinct feature of the so(5 ) limit , apart from being _",
    "gaugephobic _ , which is a generic feature in the alignment limit . moreover , the current experimental constraints force the heavy higgs sector to lie above the top - quark threshold in the ms-2hdm .",
    "thus , the dominant collider signal for this sector involves final states with third - generation quarks .",
    "we study some of these collider signals for the upcoming run of the lhc .",
    "the plan of this proceedings is as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we present the natural alignment condition for a generic 2hdm scalar potential . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we list the symmetry classifications of the 2hdm potential and identify the symmetries leading to a natural alignment . in section  [ sec:4 ] , we analyze the ms-2hdm in presence of custodial symmetry and soft breaking effects . in section  [ sec:5 ] , we discuss some collider phenomenology of the heavy higgs sector in the alignment limit , with particular emphasis on the heavy higgs sector beyond the top - quark threshold .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "for simplicity , we will consider the 2hdm potential   with cp - conserving vacua ; the results derived in this section can be easily generalized to the cp - violating 2hdm potential .",
    "we start with the linear decomposition of the two higgs doublets in terms of eight real scalar fields : @xmath24 where @xmath25  gev is the sm electroweak vev .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the three goldstone modes ( @xmath26 ) become the longitudinal components of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 bosons , and there remain five physical scalar mass eigenstates : two cp - even ( @xmath29 ) , one cp - odd ( @xmath30 ) and two charged ( @xmath31 ) scalars .",

    ", width=264 ]      so far there have been no direct searches for heavy neutral higgs bosons involving @xmath139 and/or @xmath140 final states , mainly due to the challenges associated with uncertainties in the jet energy scales and the combinatorics arising from complicated multiparticle final states in a busy qcd environment .",
    "nevertheless , these channels become pronounced in the ms-2hdm scenario , and hence , we have made a preliminary attempt to study them in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we focus on the search channel @xmath176 such four top final states have been proposed before in the context of other exotic searches at the lhc ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , their relevance for heavy higgs searches have not been explored so far .",
    "we note here that the existing 95% cl experimental upper limit on the four top production cross section is 59 fb from atlas  @xcite and 32 fb from cms  @xcite , whereas the sm prediction for the inclusive cross section of the process @xmath177 is about 10 - 15 fb  @xcite .    to get a rough estimate of the signal to background ratio for our four - top signal  , we perform a parton - level simulation of the signal and background events at lo in qcd using madgraph5_amc@nlo  @xcite with nnpdf2.3 pdf sets  @xcite .",
    "for the inclusive sm cross section for the four - top final state at @xmath151 tev lhc , we obtain 11.85 fb , whereas our proposed four - top signal cross sections are found to be comparable or smaller depending on @xmath178 and @xmath21 , as shown in figure  [ 4tx ] .",
    "however , since we expect one of the @xmath139 pairs coming from an on - shell @xmath42 decay to have an invariant mass around @xmath178 , we can use this information to significantly boost the signal over the irreducible sm background .",
    "note that all the predicted cross sections shown in figure  [ 4tx ] are well below the current experimental upper bound  @xcite .    ) in the type - ii ms-2hdm at @xmath151 tev lhc for various values of @xmath21 .",
    ", width=264 ]    depending on the @xmath145 decay mode from @xmath179 , there are 35 final states for four top decays .",
    "according to a recent atlas analysis  @xcite , the experimentally favored channel is the semi - leptonic / hadronic final state with two same - sign isolated leptons .",
    "although the branching fraction for this topology ( 4.19% ) is smaller than most of the other channels , the presence of two same - sign leptons in the final state allows us to reduce the large qcd background substantially , including that due to the sm production of @xmath180jets  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will only consider the following decay chain in our preliminary analysis : @xmath181 for event reconstruction , we will use the same selection cuts as in ( [ cut ] ) , and in addition , following  @xcite , we require the scalar sum of the @xmath182 of all leptons and jets ( defined as @xmath183 ) to exceed 350 gev .    as in the charged higgs boson case ( cf",
    ".  figure  [ ttbb - dist ] ) , the heavy higgs mass can be reconstructed from the signal given by ( [ 4t - ll ] ) using the @xmath160 endpoint technique , and therefore , an additional selection cut on @xmath184 can be used to enhance the signal over the irreducible background .",
    "our simulation results for the predicted number of signal and background events for the process ( [ 4t - ll ] ) at @xmath151 tev lhc with 300 fb@xmath174 luminosity are shown in figure  [ 4 t ] .",
    "the signal events are shown for three representative values of @xmath21 .",
    "here we vary the a priori unknown heavy higgs mass , and for each value of @xmath185 , we assume that it can be reconstructed around its actual value within 30 gev uncertainty . from this preliminary analysis , we find that the @xmath186 channel provides the most promising collider signal to probe the heavy higgs sector in the ms-2hdm at low values of @xmath187 .",
    "signal from the neutral pseudo - goldstone boson in the ms-2hdm at @xmath188 tev lhc with @xmath175 integrated luminosity .",
    ", width=264 ]    the above analysis is also applicable for the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath30 , which has similar production cross sections and @xmath139 branching fractions as the cp - even higgs @xmath42 .",
    "however , the @xmath189 production cross section as well as the @xmath190 branching ratio decreases with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath191 coupling in the alignment limit is @xmath192 , which is same as the @xmath193 coupling .",
    "thus , the high @xmath21 region of the ms-2hdm can not be searched via the @xmath186 channel proposed above , and one needs to consider the channels involving down - sector yukawa couplings , e.g. @xmath194 and @xmath195  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth commenting here that the simpler process @xmath196 at low ( high ) @xmath21 suffers from a huge sm @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) qcd background , even after imposing an @xmath197 cut .",
    "some parton - level studies of this signal in the context of mssm have been performed in  @xcite .",
    "we should clarify that the results obtained in this section are valid only at the parton level . in a realistic detector environment , the sharp features of the signal",
    "[ see e.g. ,  figure  [ ttbb - dist ] ] used to derive the sensitivity reach in figures  [ 2 tb ] and [ 4 t ] may not survive , and therefore , the signal - to - background ratio might get somewhat reduced than that shown here .",
    "a detailed detector - level analysis of these signals , including realistic top reconstruction efficiencies and smearing effects , is currently being pursued in a separate dedicated study .",
    "we provide a symmetry justification of the so - called sm alignment limit , independently of the heavy higgs spectrum and the value of @xmath21 in the 2hdm .",
    "we show that in the 2hdms where both higgs doublets acquire vevs , there exist _ only _ three different symmetry realizations , which could lead to the sm alignment by satisfying the natural alignment condition  ( [ alcond ] ) for _ any _ value of @xmath21 . in the context of the maximally symmetric 2hdm based on the so(5 ) group ,",
    "we demonstrate how small deviations from this alignment limit are naturally induced by rg effects due to the hypercharge gauge coupling @xmath23 and third generation yukawa couplings , which explicitly break the custodial symmetry of the theory .",
    "in addition , a non - zero soft so(5)-breaking mass parameter is required to yield a viable higgs spectrum consistent with the existing experimental constraints .",
    "using the current higgs signal strength data from the lhc , which disfavor large deviations from the alignment limit , we derive important constraints on the 2hdm parameter space .",
    "in particular , we predict lower limits on the mass scale of the heavy higgs spectrum , which prevail the present global fit limits in a wide range of parameter space . depending on the energy scale where the maximal symmetry could be realized in nature",
    ", we also obtain an upper limit on the heavy higgs masses in certain cases , which could be probed during the run - ii phase of the lhc .",
    "in addition , we have studied the collider signatures of the heavy higgs sector in the alignment limit beyond the top - quark threshold .",
    "we find that the final states involving third - generation quarks can become a valuable observational tool to directly probe the heavy higgs sector of the 2hdm in the alignment limit for low values of @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we emphasize the importance of _ both _ charged and neutral heavy higgs searches in order to unravel the _ doublet _ nature of the heavy higgs sector .",
