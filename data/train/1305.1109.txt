    "we consider the equation@xmath1such that @xmath2 is @xmath3 , periodic  ( @xmath4 ) , and satisfies the twist condition @xmath5 for some fixed @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is either constant ( the dc  case ) or 1-periodic in @xmath8 ( the ac  case ) . in the ac case , we further assume that @xmath9 , @xmath7 are real analytic .",
    "the case @xmath10 is the standard setting of the well - known aubry - mather theory ( @xcite , @xcite , section 9.3 ) , as the solutions of @xmath11 correspond to orbits of an area - preserving twist map @xmath12 on a cylinder whose generating function is @xmath9 .",
    "the aubry - mather theory describes minimizing configurations / orbits and measures , and so simultaneously characterizes physically important `` ground states '' of ( [ r : fk ] ) and describes `` kam - circles '' and what is left of them for @xmath12 .",
    "our goal is to contribute towards the description of the dynamics of ( r : fk ) on the entire state - space , allowing a fairly general family of initial conditions .",
    "we are , however , inspired by results on asymptotics of one - dimensional reaction - diffusion equations ( @xcite , @xcite ) , their braid dynamics ( @xcite ) , stability of synchronization phenomena ( @xcite ) ;  in the hamiltonian dynamics setting themather s measure - theoretical approach to minimizing orbits and its extensions ( @xcite ) ; pde extensions of aubry - mather theory ( llave09 ) ;  results on spatio - temporal entropy of extended pde s ( mielke09 , @xcite ) ; all related to what is actually known on the behavior of ( [ r : fk ] ) either numerically , physically ( @xcite ) or analytically ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . before stating precisely the actual results , we will try to put them in a wider context of these topics .    in the `` standard '' case @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is",
    "@xmath3 , the equation ( [ r : fk ] ) is a spatial discretization of the scalar reaction - diffusion equation@xmath16and it is closely related to a more general reaction - diffusion equation@xmath17where @xmath18 is @xmath19-periodic in the first coordinate .",
    "both ( [ r : fk ] )  and  ( [ r : rfd ] )  are scalar and order - preserving ( or monotone , or cooperative , see @xcite ) .",
    "the well - known fiedler and mallet - paret poincar - bendixson theorem @xcite showed that the asymptotics of ( r : rfd ) on any bounded domain is 2-dimensional , which is a basis of a relatively complete understanding of dynamics of ( [ r : rfd ] ) on bounded domains ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the key tool they applied is the intersection - counting function @xmath20 , which is a discrete lyapunov function .",
    "that means that @xmath21 is non - increasing along two solutions of ( [ r : rfd ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath22 has a singular zero ( we also say that @xmath23 and @xmath24 intersect non - transversally ) , @xmath25 strictly drops at @xmath26 .    these ideas have not in our knowledge been applied to the equation ( r : rfd ) on the entire @xmath27 , considered as an `` extended system '' ( i.e. without assuming @xmath28 as @xmath29 ) .",
    "the reason is that the intersection - counting function @xmath30 is typically not finite when @xmath31 are defined on the entire @xmath27 , thus all bounded - domain tools fail .",
    "we believe that the right approach in the extended - domain case is to consider the extension of the intersection - counting function @xmath30 to the space of translationally invariant measures on the state space .",
    "in this paper we pursue this idea for a technically simpler discrete - space system ( [ r : fk ] ) , and consider a function@xmath32which counts the average number of intersections of configurations with respect to two translationally invariant probability measures on the space of configurations @xmath33 .",
    "we will show that @xmath34 is a weak lyapunov function ( for details seesection [ s : measure ] ) , where @xmath35 are evolutions of measures with respect to ( [ r : fk ] ) .",
    "we believe these ideas can also be applied also to ( [ r : rfd ] ) and give fuller insight on the dynamics of ( [ r : rfd ] ) on unbounded domain . in particular , we conjecture that all our results ( with appropriate rephrasing )  hold also for ( [ r : rfd ] ) .",
    "van der berg , ghrist , vandervorst and wjcik studied in several papers topological `` braid '' properties of intersections of solutions of ( [ r : rfd ] ) on bounded domains and its spatial discretization ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our approach may lead to extension of their ideas to unbounded domains .",
    "it has been noted that synchronized solutions of the extended reaction - diffusion equation in more spatial dimensions ( @xmath36 ) are often stable and locally attracting ( see e.g. @xcite for recent results and references ) .",
    "we argue that it is possible to study this phenomenon also in the spatial dimension 1 .",
    "as compared to @xcite , we also allow unbounded solutions @xmath37 ( by identifying @xmath38 and @xmath39 and considering the dynamics in an appropriate quotient space ) , and also study non - autonomous systems ( ac  forcing ) .",
    "we eventually reduce our dynamics to a 2d flow ( dc case )  or map ( ac  case ) with non - trivial dynamics ( the spatially @xmath40 dynamics in @xcite reduces to a trivial @xmath40 flow ) .",
    "a heuristic explanation for stability of @xmath40 synchronization is now as follows :  the synchronized solutions are the solutions in the support of invariant measures  @xmath41 such that the self - intersecting function @xmath42 is equal to zero ( we consider measures invariant both for spatial translations and time evolution ) .",
    "as the function @xmath43 is non - decreasing , such solutions are expected to be at least lyapunov stable .",
    "we develop a rigorous approach to this idea .    the aubry - mather theory of ground states of ( [ r : fk ] )  in the case @xmath10 has been extended to more dimensional lattices and pdes ( @xcite and references therein ) . in our knowledge , generalizations typically deal with existence of ground states with an arbitrary generalized rotation number(rational or irrational ) . in the pde setting , this leads to construction of various solutions of stationary pdes . in our view , it is somewhat unexpected that the aubry - mather stationary structure seems to be preserved in a not entirely obvious way for an evolution equation ( [ r : fk ] ) with arbitrarily strong , and even time - periodic forcing .",
    "finally , let us come back to the actual dynamics of ( [ r : fk ] ) .",
    "the frenkel - kontorova model is one of the most studied physical models , as it reasonably realistically models a variety of physical phenomena , and is perhaps a simplest model with sufficiently rich structure allowing lots of `` metastable states '' , various phase transitions such as `` pinning - depinning '' , etc .",
    "( @xcite and references therein )",
    ". it has been long noted in the physics literature that the dynamics of ( [ r : fk ] ) seems to be attracted to low - dimensional invariant manifolds , or to spatially synchronize .",
    "baesens and mackay proved that in the dc case spatially periodic initial conditions converge either to equilibria or to uniformly sliding solutions  ( baesens98 , @xcite ;  see below for details ) .",
    "hu , bambi and qin extended some of those results to show existence and properties of spatially periodic , ordered solutions in the ac  case ( @xcite ) , and  qin studied existence and properties of uniformly sliding solutions with both rational and irrational rotation number in the dc  case ( @xcite , @xcite ) .     here",
    "we attempt to give a broader perspective on the dynamics of ( [ r : fk ] ) on a large state - space , and generalize most of the mentioned results .",
    "firstly , we consider dynamics on the space of configurations of bounded spacing ( configurations @xmath33 such that @xmath44 ) , which is more general than the configurations of bounded width ( i.e. such that @xmath45 for some @xmath46 ) rigorously studied so far .",
    "this is important , as it includes configurations connecting two configurations with different rotation number , and various other relevant situations .",
    "we then show existence of a 2d invariant set of configurations in both ac and dc  case which in a physically meaningful way attracts configurations with bounded spacing .",
    "finally , we show existence of ordered configurations with an arbitrary ( rational or irrational )  rotation number .      the state space for the dynamics of ( [ r : fk ] ) of configurations of bounded spacing will be denoted by @xmath47 , and defined precisely as follows:@xmath48with the induced product topology .",
    "we will use the quotient sets @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a translation commuting with ( [ r : fk ] ) ( for details see section [ s : measure ] ) .",
    "the system ( [ r : fk ] ) generates a continuous global semiflow and a local flow on @xmath52 ( see section 4 ) , which we denote by @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 for a given @xmath8 ) . of key importance",
    "will be the translation @xmath55 defined naturally as @xmath56 , commuting with ( [ r : fk ] ) and @xmath53 .",
    "the borel probability measures on @xmath52 will be called _ measures with bounded spacing_. we will in particular study measures with bounded spacing , invariant with respect to both the translation @xmath57 and the semilflow @xmath54 , called @xmath58-invariant . in the dc  case , the measures will be invariant with respect to @xmath54 for all @xmath59 , and in the ac  case with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "denote the sets of such measures on @xmath61 by @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",

    "our first main result is the following :    [ t : main1]there is a continuous injective projection @xmath66",
    ".    the injective projection will be given by@xmath67    as the projection @xmath68 is injective , we can pull the translation @xmath57 , and the semiflow @xmath54 in the dc  case , or the map @xmath69 to the 2-dimensional set @xmath70 .",
    "we introduce the following notation:@xmath71    [ t : main2]for each @xmath72 , the map @xmath73 is a homeomorphism of @xmath74 , in the dc@xmath75case @xmath76 is a continuous flow on @xmath74 , in the ac  case @xmath77 is a homeomorphism on @xmath74 , and @xmath73 and @xmath76 ( respectively @xmath77 ) commute .    we propose to call the pair @xmath78,@xmath79 in the dc case the _ characteristic flow - map _ , and the pair @xmath78,@xmath80 in the ac case the _",
    "characteristic maps_.    we give a detailed example in section [ s : example ] for the case @xmath10 , and relate our main results to the aubry - mather theory . in that case in particular , @xmath81 is the entire cylinder @xmath82 if @xmath9 is close to integrable , @xmath76 is the identity , and @xmath73 is diffeomorphic to an area - preserving twist map whose generating function is @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we do not know whether in general the maps @xmath73 and @xmath76 can be naturally extended to the entire cylinder @xmath82 .",
    "also unlike in the equilibrium case @xmath10 , we do not a - priori know @xmath73 , @xmath76 .",
    "we give some conjectures in section [ s : characteristic ] .",
    "we can , however , show that @xmath83 is a``rich '' set for all @xmath7 , as it contains analogues to aubry - mather sets of minimizing configurations / orbits with an arbitrary _ rotation number _ ( called also _ mean spacing _ ) found in the case @xmath10 , and to mather s minimizing measures ( @xcite ) .",
    "( we postpone definitions of rotation number , a @xmath58-ergodic measure , a rotationally ordered configuration , and totally ordered orbit to sections [ s : measure ] , s : characteristic . )",
    "[ t : main3 ] given any @xmath46 , there exists a @xmath84-ergodic measure on @xmath52 supported on a set of rotationally ordered configurations with the rotation number @xmath85 .    in the dc case",
    ", we can completely describe the set of all @xmath58-invariant and ergodic measures :    [ t : main4 ]  assume @xmath7 is dc .",
    "then every @xmath58-ergodic measure on @xmath52 is supported either on a set of equilibria , or on a single totally ordered periodic orbit .",
    "the totally ordered periodic orbits in theorem [ t : main4 ] are in the literature known as uniformly sliding states ( @xcite , baesens05 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we show in section [ s : sliding ] that the known results on uniformly sliding states follow as a direct corollary from our considerations .",
    "finally , we address asymptotics of the dynamics ( [ r : fk ] ) relative to the set @xmath0 defined by ( [ r : ea ] ) .      we propose a notion of attractiveness which is weaker than the usual notions of attractor or union of @xmath86-limit sets , but for extended systems such as ( [ r : fk ] ) often in practice ( physical systems or numerical simulations )",
    "indistinguishable from them .",
    "imagine a physical situation in which we observe dynamics of ( [ r : fk ] ) on @xmath87 ( or a very large subset of @xmath87 ) , and that no position in space is preferred .",
    "consider also that an initial condition @xmath88 emerges as a realization of some spatially homogenous random process .",
    "for example , we can choose @xmath88 as a double - infinite sequence so that @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) is chosen randomly and independently in each step @xmath91 from the same bounded measurable subset of @xmath27 .",
    "we can study that as analyzing the dynamics ( [ r : fk ] ) with respect to @xmath41-a.e initial condition , where @xmath41 is a @xmath57-invariant probability measure on @xmath52 . we propose a notion of spatio - temporal attractiveness , and",
    "say that a set @xmath0 is a spatio - temporal attractor , if given any @xmath57-invariant probability measure @xmath41 , then for @xmath41-a.e .",
    "initial condition @xmath38 and with density of times @xmath8 equal to @xmath19 , @xmath92 is arbitrarily close to @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , given any @xmath93 , we define the borel probability measure @xmath94 on @xmath95 $ ] as the product measure @xmath96 , where @xmath97 $ ] , and define the attractor as follows :    a set @xmath0 is a spatio - temporal attractor for ( [ r : fk ] ) on @xmath52 , if given any @xmath57-invariant probability measure @xmath98on @xmath52 and any open neighbourhood @xmath99 of @xmath0 , @xmath100    we finally in section [ s : attractor ] we show that the set @xmath0 described in theorems [ t : main1]-[t : main4 ] , is indeed a spatio - temporal attractor .",
    "[ t : main5]the set @xmath0 defined with ( [ r : ea ] ) is the spatio - temporal attractor for ( [ r : fk ] ) on @xmath52 .",
    "lastly , we comment on the spatio - temporal entropy of ( [ r : fk ] ) .",
    "a corollary of theorem [ t : main4 ] is that the spatio - temporal entropy of ( [ r : fk ] ) on @xmath52 in the dc  case is zero ( see e.g. mielke09 , @xcite for definitions ) .",
    "a proof follows from the variational principle for metric and topological spatio - temporal entropy and our description of all spatio - temporal invariant measures ;  we intend to report details separately .",
    "this complements well the existing results for pde  systems such as ( [ r : rfd ] ) .",
    "specifically , zelik @xcite showed that extended gradient systems ( the case @xmath10 of ( [ r : fk ] ) ) have spatio - temporal entropy zero , mielke and zelik @xcite constructed @xmath40 non - autonomous pde  examples with positive entropy , and turaev and zelik @xcite proved positive entropy for a @xmath40 complex system .      in section [ s : example ] we as an example summarize the known facts on the dynamics ( [ r : fk ] )  in the `` extended gradient '' case @xmath10 , and relate them to our results . in sections",
    "[ s : zeroset ] , [ s : intersections ] we develop tools on the dynamics of the zero - set of a non - autonomous system of infinitely many linear odes , and as a corollary on dynamics of intersections of a cooperative system of infinitely many odes .",
    "here we extend some of the known results ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )  to systems of infinitely many odes , less smooth then e.g. in @xcite , and on a general space of solutions ( the frchet space of configurations of sub - exponential growth at infinity ) .",
    "as such , our results could be of independent interest .",
    "we postpone most of the technicalities to appendices 1,2 , dealing in particular with some exceptional , `` degenerate '' situations due to the infinite number of equations . in section [",
    "s : measure ] we introduce the semiflow on the space of translationally invariant measures on @xmath52 , and show that the average - number - of - intersections - counting function @xmath101 is non - increasing and strictly decreasing if @xmath31 in the supports of @xmath102 have a non - transversal intersection ( or , using the alternative terminology of the paper , @xmath103 has a singular zero ) .",
    "once all the tools are in place , the proofs of theorems [ t : main1][t : main5 ] are relatively straightforward and given in sections [ s : characteristic][s : attractor ] , including a more detailed discussion of uniformly sliding states .",
    "in this section we relate our results to the known results in the case of no driving @xmath10 .",
    "our assumptions on the function @xmath9 are the standard setting of the aubry - mather theory .",
    "let us first consider the equilibria @xmath104 of ( [ r : fk ] ) , denoted by @xmath105 , where we again identify @xmath38 and @xmath51 and consider the quotient set .",
    "it is straightforward to deduce from the conditions on @xmath9 that the projection @xmath106 is a homeomorphism ( again considering the induced product topology on @xmath107 ) .",
    "also the map @xmath108 is @xmath3 , diffeomorphic to the twist map generated by @xmath9 ( @xcite , section 9.3 ) .",
    "the diffeomorphism is given by the discrete legendre transform , which is for example  identity in the `` standard '' case@xmath109where @xmath110and @xmath111 is a @xmath3 function .",
    "it is however not a - priori clear that all the @xmath58-invariant measures of ( [ r : fk ] ) with @xmath10 are supported on @xmath112 .",
    "the system ( [ r : fk ] ) is an example of an extended gradient system , i.e. a system which has a formal lyapunov function ( in our case the formal sum @xmath113 ) , and is a gradient system when reduced to a finite domain .",
    "it has been shown that extended gradient systems can have more complex dynamics than what is by lasalle principle possible for gradient systems ( @xcite , @xcite , slijepcevic00 ) , including possible existence of non - stationary orbits in @xmath86-limit sets .",
    "in @xcite we however showed the following :    all @xmath58-invariant measures of ( [ r : fk ] )  on @xmath52 in the case @xmath10 are supported on @xmath112 .",
    "the key tool is an observation that the function @xmath114 is a lyapunov function on the space of @xmath57-invariant probability measures @xmath52 , so lasalle principle must hold for the evolution of @xmath57-invariant measures .",
    "we conclude that theorems [ t : main1]-[t : main3 ] do hold in the case @xmath10 , where the measures in theorem [ t : main3 ] are for example mather s minimizing measures ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss the question whether and when @xmath115 is a homeomorphism , where @xmath0 is the support of all @xmath58-invariant measures of bounded spacing as defined in ( [ r : ea ] ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath68 is a homeomorphism if and only if @xmath116 .",
    "this is true because @xmath73 is diffeomorphic to an area - preserving map , so we can pull back a lebesgue measure and construct @xmath58-invariant measures supported on any closed subset of @xmath117 . in general , @xmath116 is true if and only if the area - preserving twist map @xmath12 generated by @xmath9 is close enough to integrable .",
    "for example , in the standard case ( [ r : standard ] ) , @xmath118 holds if and only if @xmath12 has homotopically non - trivial invariant circles ,  otherwise one can construct `` accelerating '' invariant measures of @xmath12 ;  i.e. there are @xmath57-invariant measures in @xmath112 which do not have bounded spacing ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , let us consider asymptotics .",
    "the following slightly stronger version of theorem [ t : main5 ] in the case @xmath10 was shown in slijepcevic00 and extended in @xcite , @xcite for much more general systems :    [ t : seven]consider the dynamics ( [ r : fk ] )  with @xmath10 on @xmath119 .",
    "( i )  if @xmath41 is a @xmath57-invariant borel probability measure on @xmath52 , then the @xmath86-limit set for @xmath41-a.e .",
    "@xmath120 consists of equilibria .",
    "( ii )  let @xmath120 and let @xmath99 be any open neighborhood of @xmath112 .",
    "then the set of times @xmath121 such that @xmath122 has banach density @xmath19 .",
    "we can rephrase theorem [ t : seven ] , and say that the @xmath86-limit set consists of equilibria either almost surely with respect to space , or with respect to time .",
    "one can not omit the `` almost surely '' part of the statement and still obtain a @xmath123 union of limit sets either in theorem [ t : main5 ] or [ t : seven ] , as it is most likely infinite - dimensional , analogously to the continuous space case ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we first consider in general terms properties of the zero - set of a solution of a linear , cooperative non - autonomous system of infinitely many ordinary differential equations .",
    "we show that the number of zeroes in a bounded domain can not increase and is strictly decreasing at singular zeroes .",
    "we then extend these ideas to systems of infinitely many equations , and establish a `` zero - balance equation '' .",
    "although some of the ideas presented here are essentially for finite dimensional systems already contained in @xcite , @xcite , our presentation follows more closely angenent , fiedler and mallet - paret @xcite , angenent88 , @xcite who developed it in the pde setting .",
