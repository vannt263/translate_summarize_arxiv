    "in this work , we consider topological spaces @xmath0 which are continua ; that is , compact , connected metric spaces .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 has the additional structure of a codimension - zero foliated space , so are _ matchbox manifolds_. the path - connected components of @xmath0 form the leaves of a foliation @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "the precise definitions are given in section  [ sec - concepts ] below .",
    "matchbox manifolds arise naturally in the study of exceptional minimal sets for foliations of compact manifolds , and as the tiling spaces associated to repetitive , aperiodic tilings of euclidean space @xmath3 which have finite local complexity .",
    "they also arise in some aspects of group representation theory and index theory for leafwise elliptic operators for foliations , as discussed in the books @xcite .",
    "the class of williams solenoids and the results about these spaces provide one motivation for this work .",
    "recall that an expanding attractor @xmath4 for an axiom a diffeomorphism @xmath5 of a compact manifold is a continuum ; that is , a compact , connected metric space . williams developed a structure theory for these spaces in his seminal works @xcite .",
    "the hyperbolic splitting of the tangent bundle to @xmath6 along @xmath4 yields a foliation of the space @xmath4 by leaves of the expanding foliation for @xmath7 , and the contracting foliation for @xmath7 gives a transverse foliation on an open neighborhood @xmath8 .",
    "williams used this additional structure on a neighborhood of @xmath4 to obtain a `` presentation '' of @xmath4 as an inverse limit of `` branched @xmath9-manifolds '' , @xmath10 , where @xmath9 is the dimension of the expanding bundle for @xmath7 , and the map @xmath7 induces the map @xmath11 between the approximations .",
    "the notion of a @xmath12-dimensional branched manifold is easiest to define , as the branches are required only to meet each other at disjoint vertices . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the definition of branched manifolds becomes more subtle , and especially for the `` transversality condition '' imposed on the cell attachment maps .",
    "the spaces @xmath4 with this structure are called _ williams solenoids _ in the literature .",
    "the topological properties of the approximating map @xmath10 is used to study the the dynamical system defined by @xmath7 , for example as discussed in the works @xcite and others .",
    "the riemann surface laminations introduced by sullivan @xcite are compact topological spaces locally homeomorphic to a complex disk times a cantor set , and a similar notion is used by lyubich and minsky in @xcite , and ghys in @xcite .",
    "these are also well - known examples of matchbox manifolds .",
    "associated to the foliation @xmath1 of a matchbox manifold @xmath0 is a compactly generated pseudogroup @xmath13 acting on a `` transverse '' totally disconnected space @xmath14 , which determines the transverse dynamical properties of @xmath1 .",
    "the first two authors showed in @xcite that if the action of @xmath13 on @xmath14 is equicontinuous , then @xmath0 is homeomorphic to a weak solenoid ( in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "equivalently , the shape of @xmath0 is defined by a tower of proper covering maps between compact manifolds of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the shape properties of an arbitrary matchbox manifold @xmath0 , without the assumption that the dynamics of the associated action of @xmath13 is equicontinuous , though with the assumption that @xmath0 is minimal ; that is , that every leaf of @xmath1 is dense . we also assume that @xmath1 is without holonomy .",
    "our main result shows that all such spaces have an analogous structure as that of a william solenoid .",
    "an important difference between the case of williams solenoids , and the general case we consider , is that the tower of approximations is not in general defined by a single map , but uses a sequence of maps between compact branched manifolds",
    ".    a _ presentation _ of a space @xmath15 is a collection of continuous maps @xmath16 , where each @xmath17 is a connected compact branched @xmath9-manifold , and each @xmath18 is a proper surjective map of branched manifolds , as defined in section  [ sec - cantorprojections ] .",
    "it is assumed that there is given a homeomorphism @xmath19 between @xmath15 and the inverse limit space defined by @xmath20 a _ vietoris solenoid _",
    "@xcite is a @xmath12-dimensional solenoid , where each @xmath17 is a circle , and each @xmath21 is a covering map of degree greater than @xmath12 . more generally , if each @xmath17 is a compact manifold and each @xmath22 is a proper covering map , then we say that @xmath23 is a _ weak solenoid _ , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "here is our main result .",
    "[ thm - main1 ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a minimal matchbox manifold of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "assume that the foliation @xmath1 of @xmath0 is without holonomy .",
    "then there exists a presentation @xmath24 where each @xmath17 is a triangulated branched @xmath9-manifold and each @xmath22 is a proper simplicial map , so that @xmath0 is homeomorphic to the inverse limit of the system of maps they define , @xmath25    the hypothesis that @xmath1 is without holonomy may possibly be removed , using a more general definition of the bonding maps allowed .",
    "the work by benedetti and gambaudo in @xcite gives a model for such a result , in the case of tiling spaces associated with an action of a connected lie group @xmath26 .",
    "also , the results of the first two authors in @xcite applies to equicontinuous matchbox manifolds which may have non - trivial leafwise holonomy . on the other hand ,",
    "a generalization of theorem  [ thm - main1 ] to arbitrary minimal matchbox manifolds would yield solutions to several classical problems in the study of exceptional minimal sets for codimension - one foliations , for example as listed in @xcite , so an extension of theorem  [ thm - main1 ] to this generality would be important , but is expected to involve additional subtleties .    in this work",
    ", no assumptions are made on the geometry and topology of the leaves in @xmath0 , beyond that they are complete riemannian manifolds . in order to construct the branched manifold approximations to @xmath0",
    ", we use a technique based on `` dynamical codings '' for the orbits of the pseudogroup associated to the foliation , a method which generalizes that used by gambaudo and martens @xcite for flows .",
    "this coding method can also be seen as extending a technique used by thomas in his study of equicontinuous flows in @xcite .",
    "the first two authors used this coding approach in their study of equicontinuous actions of groupoids on cantor sets in @xcite , and it also appears implicitly in the work by forrest @xcite in his study of minimal actions of @xmath27 on cantor sets .",
    "the coding method we use is more formal , so applies in complete generality .",
    "the other ingredient required is the existence of a transverse cantor foliation in the generality we consider .",
    "we construct these foliations in this work , extending the results of the authors paper @xcite .",
    "the existence of a compatible transverse cantor foliation @xmath28 on @xmath0 is fundamental for defining the branched manifold approximations .",
    "as mentioned above , tiling spaces provide an important class of examples for which theorem  [ thm - main1 ] applies .",
    "let @xmath29 be a tiling of @xmath3 which is repetitive , aperiodic , and has finite local complexity .",
    "the tiling space @xmath30 is defined as the closure of the set of tilings obtained via the translation action of @xmath3 , in a suitable metric topology @xcite .",
    "the assumptions imply that @xmath30 is locally homeomorphic to a disk in @xmath31 times a cantor set , so that @xmath30 is a matchbox manifold .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of variants of this result . )",
    "the seminal result of anderson and putnam in @xcite showed that under these assumptions , and under the assumption that the tiling @xmath29 is defined by an expanding substitution , then @xmath30 is homeomorphic to the inverse limit of a tower of branched flat @xmath9-manifolds .",
    "the approach of anderson and putnam , and the alternative approaches to generalizing their method and extending the conclusion to all tilings by ghler and sadun @xcite , and in works @xcite , used variations on a technique called `` collaring '' or a method called `` inflation '' of a voronoi tessellation of @xmath3 , to obtain the branched manifold approximations for @xmath30 . the more recent work @xcite gives a version of this method closest to the approach we take in this paper .",
    "the work here is an important step in developing the general theory of point patterns and tilings for general , non - euclidean spaces .",
    "as described in senechal  @xcite , the theory of point patterns and tilings is directly connected to the theory of quasicrystals , and so our work can be seen as a step towards understanding possible quasicrystalline structures in non - euclidean spaces .",
    "we discuss next the contents of the rest of this work , which culminates in the proof of theorem  [ thm - main1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec - concepts ] introduces the basic definitions of a matchbox manifold , and section  [ sec - holonomy ] introduces the definitions and properties of the holonomy pseudogroups for matchbox manifolds , as developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec - voronoi ] discusses the voronoi tessellations of the leaves associated to transversal clopen sets , then section  [ sec - induced ] develops some fundamental properties of restricted pseudogroups .    a coding of the orbits of the action of the holonomy pseudogroup of the foliation @xmath1 on @xmath0 is developed in section  [ sec - partialcoding ] , and used to construct `` dynamically defined '' nested sequences of clopen coverings @xmath32 for @xmath33 of a cantor transversal to @xmath1 , which are `` centered '' on the transverse orbit defined by a fixed leaf @xmath34 .",
    "the study of the dynamics of the induced action on a descending chain of clopen neighborhoods is a standard technique in almost all approaches to the study of the dynamics of minimal actions on a cantor set .",
    "it corresponds to the initial steps in the construction of a kakutani tower for the measurable theory of group actions .    in section  [ sec - reebslabs ] , we associate to each clopen covering of the transversal space @xmath14 a collection of open sets , called _ reeb neighborhoods _ which form a covering of @xmath0 .",
    "the results of @xcite show that each such reeb neighborhood projects along a transverse cantor foliation to its compact base .",
    "section  [ sec - compatiblecantor ] uses the results in @xcite to show that these bi - foliated structures on the reeb neighborhoods can be chosen to be compatible on overlaps . in section  [ sec - cantorprojections ] , the proof of theorem  [ thm - main1 ] is completed , by showing that the reeb neighborhoods collapsed along the cantor transversal foliation , can be identified ( or `` glued '' ) each to the other on their overlaps , to obtain a branched @xmath9-manifold . by iterating this process for a chain of clopen covers for @xmath14 , we obtain a tower of maps whose inverse limit is homeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "note that the works @xcite follow a similar approach to the above , but using an intuitive extension of the zooming technique for voronoi cells as in @xcite .",
    "the geometry and topology of a generic leaf @xmath34 can be quite complicated , and not at all as intuitively straightforward as for the case of euclidean spaces . hence the geometry and topology of the voronoi cells which decompose",
    "@xmath34 may be similarly non - intuitive .",
    "some of the subtleties for voronoi partitions at large scale in non - euclidean manifolds are discussed , for example , in the work @xcite .",
    "the more formal approach using codings that we use in this work avoids the need to control the geometry of the voronoi cells introduced .",
    "the reader will also find the care taken with the domains of holonomy maps makes the proofs of some results quite tedious at times , but a careful consideration of examples shows that these concerns are required .",
    "this work is part of a program to generalize the results of the thesis of fokkink @xcite , started during a visit by the authors to the university of delft in august 2009 .",
    "the papers @xcite are the initial results of this study , and this work is the preparation for the forthcoming paper @xcite which completes the program . the authors would like to thank robbert fokkink for the invitation to meet in delft , and the university of delft for its generous support for the visit . the authors stay in delft was also supported by a travel grant no .",
