    "a star passing at a small enough distance from a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is captured or tidally disrupted , producing a detectable flare in multiple wavebands @xcite . estimating the rate of such events is the topic of the loss - cone theory , first developed in 1970s in application to hypothetical intermediate - mass black holes in globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . later on ,",
    "this theory was applied to smbh in galactic centres @xcite , typically estimating the tidal disruption rate to be in the range @xmath2 events per year per galaxy .",
    "observational constraints from optical @xcite , uv @xcite or x - ray @xcite surveys roughly fall into the same range ( see also a review by * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite raised a concern that the observationally derived event rates are systematically lower than the theoretical estimates , by as much as one order of magnitude , although the uncertainties are hardly smaller than that on either side .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a mechanism that can significantly reduce the event rates in galaxies with long enough relaxation times and alleviate the tension between theory and observations , namely the influence of tangentially anisotropic initial conditions .",
    "the source of this anisotropy could be a gap in the low - angular - momentum region of the phase space , created by a binary smbh @xcite , or simply a mild bias towards circular orbits .",
    "we do not attempt to model individual galaxies , but focus instead on the comparison of steady - state rates , typically used in the literature , with the reduced ones from anisotropic but otherwise the same initial conditions , in order to derive the suppression factor as a function of galaxy parameters .",
    "we only consider spherically symmetric galaxies , therefore obtaining a lower boundary on the possible event rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : diffeqn ] we write down the fokker ",
    "planck equation that describes the diffusion of stars in angular momentum , and derive its time - dependent analytical solution . then in section  [ sec : initcond ] we present the modifications of initial conditions that have tangential anisotropy . in section  [ sec : results ] we obtain the estimates of capture rates for our choice of initial conditions , and compute the suppression factor with respect to the steady - state capture rates .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "two - body relaxation that changes energies @xmath3 and angular momenta @xmath4 of stars can be described in terms of orbit - averaged fokker ",
    "planck equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the changes in angular momentum are much more important for computing the capture rates @xcite , and for this reason the diffusion in energy is usually neglected ; numerical solution of the more general two - dimensional fokker ",
    "planck equation @xcite confirms the validity of one - dimensional approximation for processes that occur on a timescale much shorter than the relaxation time @xmath5 . at a fixed energy @xmath3 , the distribution function ( df ) of stars @xmath6 as a function of normalized angular momentum @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the angular momentum of a circular orbit with the same energy , satisfies the diffusion equation in a cylindrical geometry :    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the orbit - averaged diffusion coefficient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  18 ) , which is assumed to be independent of @xmath11 , allowing an analytical solution to this equation @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath12 is of the neumann type : @xmath13 ( zero - flux condition ) .",
    "the presence of the black hole creates a capture boundary at @xmath14 , the angular momentum at which a star would be tidally disrupted at periapsis . as discussed in @xcite , there are two limiting cases for the behaviour of @xmath6 near @xmath15 , depending on the ratio @xmath16 between the mean - square change in @xmath11 due to relaxation over one orbital period @xmath17 and the size of the loss cone . in the general case , one may use a robin - type boundary condition ( a linear combination of the function and its derivative ) , which naturally interpolates between the regimes of empty ( @xmath18 ) and full ( @xmath19 ) loss cone :    @xmath20    in the steady state , the flux of stars towards the capture boundary @xmath21 is nearly independent of @xmath11 at low @xmath11 , and the solution of equation  [ eq : diffusion ] has a logarithmic profile : @xmath22 . extrapolating this functional form to all @xmath11 ,",
    "one obtains the classical quasi - steady - state solution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  51 , with @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xcite defined an effective capture boundary @xmath24 , at which the inward extrapolation of the logarithmic solution reaches zero ; this gives the same boundary condition at the true capture boundary as equation  [ eq : bdryinner ] , except for their slightly different expression for @xmath25 .",
    "the general time - dependent solution of equation ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) subject to the specified boundary conditions can be expressed in a series form ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equations  2426 ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are bessel functions of the first and the second kind , @xmath29 are the basis function , @xmath30 are the roots of a certain equation that satisfy the boundary conditions for each basis function , and @xmath31 are the expansion coefficients computed from the initial conditions @xmath32 .",
    "the above study derived their expressions for the limiting case of an empty loss cone , i.e.  the boundary condition @xmath33 .",
    "taking the same inward extrapolation of the logarithmic profile as in @xcite , one can use their expressions with a modified capture boundary @xmath34 for the general case of a non - empty loss cone ( this method was adopted for the time - dependent solution in * ? ? ? * ) ; however , the validity of this approach depends on the assumption of the solution being close to the steady - state profile .",
    "instead , in this work we generalize the analytical solution to the arbitrary boundary conditions given by equation  [ eq : bdryinner ] .",
    "namely , the coefficients @xmath30 that enter the expressions for the series expansion are the roots of the following equation : @xmath35 y_1(\\beta_m ) \\;-   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\left [ y_0 ( \\beta_m j_{\\rm lc } ) + \\alpha \\beta_m j_{\\rm lc } y_1 ( \\beta_m j_{\\rm lc } ) / 2 \\right ] j_1(\\beta_m)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this modification is necessary to obtain a rigorous solution for non - trivial initial conditions , such as those considered in the next section , although it gives only a minor correction to the more approximate treatment in the case of a nearly - logarithmic form of the solution ( i.e.  late enough into the evolution ) .    the series solution with a finite number of terms @xmath36 breaks down at small times ( @xmath37 ) , so we compute the solution numerically with a finite - difference scheme in this case .",
    "the stationary solution with a logarithmic @xmath11-dependence of df is attained at times greater than an appreciable fraction of the relaxation time . on the other hand",
    ", this time may well exceed the age of the universe , especially in low - density galactic nuclei .",
    "therefore , the choice of initial conditions becomes important for determining the present - day capture rates .",
    "we consider two classes of initial dfs with a deficit of stars at low angular momenta , compared to the isotropic population .",
    "the first possible reason for such a deficit is the ejection of stars by a binary smbh that may have existed in a galaxy previously .",
    "the slingshot mechanism is responsible for the flattening of the density profile and the formation of cores @xcite , which have been detected observationally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , it creates a gap in the phase space , ejecting stars with angular momenta less than some critical value , which corresponds to the periapsis radius comparable to the radius of a hard binary , @xmath38\\,{r_\\mathrm{infl}}$ ] , where @xmath39 is the mass ratio of the binary , and @xmath40 is the smbh radius of influence . in this work",

    "the time time required to establish the steady - state profile at a given energy is @xmath73 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  34 ) ; as the maximum of the total flux arrives from energies corresponding to @xmath40 , the time to refill the gap is roughly @xmath74 , or @xmath75    for @xmath76 the flux",
    "is reduced compared to the stationary value , which is commonly used in calculations of tidal disruption rates .",
    "the maximum value of capture rate reached at @xmath77 is somewhat lower than the steady - state value , due to the fact that the @xmath4-averaged df is also depleted at high binding energies ( where @xmath78 ) with respect to the value used in the steady - state calculation .",
    "the flux reaches 1/2 of its maximum value at @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , at @xmath80 it starts to decline in the absense of diffusion in energy .",

    "on the other hand , taking it into account modifies the solution at @xmath83 so that it tends to a steady - state profile .",
    "therefore we may trust our calculations roughly up to a time when the flux reaches its maximum .",
    "we also explore the effect of changing the normalization in @xmath70 relation ( [ eq : msigma ] ) .",
    "this , of course , modifies both the time - dependent flux and the relaxation time at @xmath40 ( [ eq : scaling_flux],[eq : scaling_time ] ) , but the normalized values still stay on the same curve for each @xmath55 and @xmath72 .",
    "finally , the second class of models with globally tangentially anisotropic initial conditions ( figure  [ fig : capturerate ] , bottom panel ) produce a milder decline of the capture rate at @xmath84 .",
    "we have considered the question whether the capture rate of stars by smbh can be substantially lowered with respect to the steady - state value by a suitable modification of initial conditions .",
    "we used an analytical time - dependent solution of the fokker ",
    "planck equation to compute the capture rate for the given initial conditions as a function of time .",
    "two classes of initial conditions were analyzed : a gap in the low - angular - momentum region of phase space , created by a binary smbh , and a separable distribution function with a mild tangential velocity anisotropy .",
    "the results of our study can be summarized as follows .",
    "if the relaxation time in the galaxy centre is short enough ( @xmath85  yr ) , any difference between initial conditions is erased quite rapidly , and the capture rate approaches the steady - state value . on the other hand , for @xmath86  yr anisotropic initial conditions may substantially reduce the capture rate ( in the intermediate range of @xmath5 , their effect is moderate ) . in our series of models with a phase - space gap , for smbh masses",
    "@xmath87 the suppression factor ( the ratio of time - dependent to steady - state capture rates ) drops quite rapidly , plunging below @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "note that for even heavier black holes , visible flares constitute a small fraction of the captured stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in models with mild tangential anisotropy",
    "the suppression factor is not so extreme , but nevertheless can reduce the flux by a factor of a few for @xmath90 .",
    "we have extended the work of @xcite into the range of smaller smbh masses ( @xmath91 ) , since they are more numerous in the universe and are expected to dominate the overall tidal disruption rates .",
    "moreover , smaller @xmath59 residing in more compact galactic nuclei are not well described by the empty - loss - cone regime adopted in that paper . in this study",
    "we have derived the solution for the general case ; we checked that assuming an empty - loss - cone boundary condition does not substantially change the results for @xmath87 , but overestimates the flux by a factor of a few for the least massive smbhs .",
    "we used a somewhat different initial distribution function inside the gap than the above paper , but checked that adopting their initial conditions changes the results only marginally .",
    "however , our estimates of the time required for the capture rate to reach 1/2 of its steady - state value , @xmath92 , the latter given by equation  [ eq : trefill ] , are about an order of magnitude longer than shown in figure  3 or equation  14 of @xcite for the same galaxy parameters .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy might be due to a calibration error in that paper , as our expressions for @xmath93 agree with equation  7 in @xcite and equation  36 in @xcite .",
    "we deliberately have made a number of simplifying assumptions that drive our capture rates towards lower values .",
    "first , we assumed a spherical geometry , while it is known that non - spherical torques can result in a higher efficiency of loss - cone repopulation @xcite .",
    "naturally , the difference between spherical and non - spherical geometry starts to manifest itself above the same threshold value of @xmath59 as the influence of initial conditions ( figure  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , again underlining the distinction between relaxed and non - relaxed galactic nuclei . note that by relaxed we here mean the systems that had enough time to establish a nearly steady - state logarithmic profile in angular momentum distribution ; this does not mean they were able to relax in energy space as well and develop a @xcite cusp .",
    "second , we neglected non - classical phenomena that may increase the relaxation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , such as mass segregation @xcite , massive perturbers @xcite , or resonant relaxation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5.6 ) ; the latter , however , is typically not very effective in boosting the capture rates @xcite .",
    "a number of other refinements have been shown by @xcite to have little impact on the final values .",
    "binary smbh that have not yet coalesced also suppress the capture rates @xcite , although they may demonstrate brief episodes of increased encounter rates at early stage of evolution @xcite .",
    "thus our findings can be regarded as robust lower limits on the capture rates for single smbh .",
    "the effect investigated in this paper is unlikely to substantially reduce the rate of tidal disruption events for black hole masses smaller than @xmath94 . although the volumetric rate of tidal disruption events is dominated by galaxies with smallest @xmath59 ( e.g.  figure  8 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the rate of _ observable _ events ( figure  10 in that paper ) may be significantly affected by the suggested mechanism if either ( 1 ) the smbh mass function is suppressed at low - mass end , or ( 2 ) flare emission mechanisms are inefficient for low - mass smbh .",
    "these factors are still the main sources of uncertainty in the estimates of the observable event rate @xcite ; however , it is notable that the distribution of actually observed flares peaks around @xmath95 ( figure  11 in that paper ) .",
    "thus the effect considered here may potentially be important in comparing the theoretical predictions of tidal disruption rates with observations .",
