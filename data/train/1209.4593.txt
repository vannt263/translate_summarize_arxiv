    "there are no strictly 2d ( two - dimensional ) systems in the real world .",
    "however , if the carriers are strongly confined in one direction they have quantized energy levels for one spatial dimension but are free to move in two spacial dimensions@xcite .",
    "thus the wave vector is a good quantum number for two dimensions but not for the third .",
    "examples are narrow quantum wells and graphene . in many situations these systems can be approximated by the idealized systems of strictly 2d sheets .",
    "even thicker films where the spatial quantization is negligible behave as strictly 2d from distances much larger than the film thickness .",
    "the dielectric functions of a 2d electron gas@xcite and for graphene@xcite have been derived in the literature . the dielectric function for graphene is valid for an idealized 2d sheet . if one were to treat graphene as a film of finite thickness one could not use the 2d dielectric function as it is .",
    "it has to be modified into a 3d version .",
    "the same thing applies to a strictly 2d metal sheet if it were to be treated as a film of finite thickness .",
    "if a metal film of finite thickness with a bulk dielectric function were to be treated as a strictly 2d sheet the dielectric function had to be modified into a 2d version .",
    "how these modifications can be done is what this paper is all about .",

    "[ nonplanar ] how the results for 2d sheets and thin films can be used in non - planar structures .",
    "for the present task we need a geometry consisting of two regions and one interface , @xmath0 . for planar structures",
    "there are two types of mode , transverse magnetic ( tm ) or @xmath1-polarized and transverse electric ( te ) or @xmath2-polarized .",
    "they have different amplitude reflection coefficients . at an interface between medium @xmath3 and @xmath4 the tm and te amplitude reflection coefficients for waves impinging from the @xmath3 side are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",

    "( [ equ1]-[equ3 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude reflection coefficients and the @xmath13 -functions are functions of @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "the dielectric functions are functions of @xmath14 , only , i.e. , spatial dispersion is neglected .",
    "inclusion of spatial dispersion in the bulk dielectric functions is possible@xcite but would lead to much higher complexity and negligible effects in most cases .",
    "there are different formulations of electromagnetism in the literature .",
    "the difference lies in how the conduction carriers are treated . in one formulation",
    "these carriers are lumped together with the external charges to form the group of free charges .",
    "then only the bound charges contribute to the screening .",
    "we want to be able to treat geometries with metallic regions .",
    "then this formulation is not suitable . in the formulation that we use",
    "the conduction carriers are treated on the same footing as the bound charges .",
    "thus , both bound and conduction charges contribute to the dielectric function . in the two formalisms the * e * and * b * fields , the true fields , of course are the same . however , the auxiliary fields the * d * and * h * fields are different . to indicate that we use this alternative formulation",
    "we put a tilde above the * d * and * h * fields and also above the dielectric functions .",
    "[ ] for a fuller discussion on this topic .    within this formalism the standard boundary conditions , used to derive the reflection coefficients , are that in absence of external charge and current densities at an interface the tangential components of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 fields and the normal components of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 fields are all continuous across the interface .",
    "the sources to the fields in maxwell s equations are the external charge and current densities . in the boundary conditions",
    "any discontinuities in the normal component of the @xmath17 fields and tangential component of the @xmath16 fields are caused by external surface charge densities and external surface current densities , respectively .",
    "the amplitude reflection coefficient gets modified if there is a 2d layer at the interface .",
    "we treat@xcite the 2d layer at the interface as external to our system .",
    "the modified amplitude reflection coefficient for a tm mode is @xcite @xmath19 where the polarizability , @xmath20 , of the 2d sheet is obtained from the dynamical conductivity , @xmath21 ,    @xmath22    and the dielectric function is @xmath23 for tm modes the tangential component of the electric field , which will induce the external current , is parallel to * k * , so the longitudinal 2d dielectric function of the sheet enters .",
    "the bound charges in the 2d sheet also contribute to the dynamical conductivity and the polarizability .    the modified amplitude reflection coefficient for a te mode is @xcite @xmath24 where the polarizability , @xmath25 , of the 2d sheet is obtained from the dynamical conductivity , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the dielectric function is @xmath28 for a te wave the electric field is perpendicular to * k * , so the transverse 2d dielectric function of the sheet enters .",
    "the bound charges in the 2d sheet also contribute to the dynamical conductivity and the polarizability .",
    "if retardation is neglected there is only one mode type and the amplitude reflection coefficient is @xmath29 now we have in eqs .",

    "is that spatial dispersion of the 2d sheet can be included without any complications .",
    "this spatial dispersion has furthermore important effects as we will show later . in next section",
    "we will show the corresponding results when instead of a 2d sheet we have a thin film sandwiched between the two media .      for the present task",
    "we need a geometry consisting of three regions and two interfaces , @xmath30 . for this composite interface the amplitude reflection coefficient for a wave impinging from the @xmath3 side is@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the thickness of the film @xmath4 .",
    "this expression is valid for tm- and te - modes when retardation is included and also for the modes when retardation is neglected .",
    "the appropriate amplitude reflection coefficient from eqs . ( [ equ1]-[equ3 ] ) should be used in the expression on the right hand side . in next section",
    "we show how the effect of a strictly 2d sheet can be modeled by a film of finite thickness with the proper choice of 3d dielectric function .",
    "let us study a 2d - sheet placed in a time varying electric field , @xmath15 , in the plane of the film .",
    "there will be a surface current density , @xmath33 .",
    "this current density has contributions also from bound charges .",
    "since we want to treat this 2d sheet as a thin film of finite thickness , @xmath34 , we let this current be spread evenly through the thickness of the film . the volume current density , @xmath35 , is then @xmath36 , and since @xmath37 it follows that @xmath38 now , since @xmath39 and @xmath40 we find that @xmath41 thus in problems with 2d sheets one can treat the sheets as thin 3d films where the 3d polarizability above is used . to check if this is a reasonable approach we insert the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ equ1]-[equ3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ equ11 ] ) where now @xmath32 is @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "if we now let the film thickness , @xmath42 , go towards zero we reproduce the results in eqs .",
    "( [ equ4 ] ) , ( [ equ7 ] ) , and ( [ equ10 ] ) .",
    "thus in the limit the model is exact .",
    "we will now calculate the casimir interaction energy between two free standing undoped graphene sheets in vacuum . to make it as simple as possible we neglect retardation and perform the calculations for zero temperature .",
    "retardation effects are actually very small in graphene @xcite . in a general point , @xmath44 , in the complex frequency plane , away from the real axis the polarizability is @xcite        @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the carrier velocity which is a constant in graphene ( @xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 represents the degeneracy parameter with the value of 4 ( a factor of 2 for spin and a factor of 2 for the cone degeneracy ) . in the numerical calculations we use the value@xcite @xmath49 m",
