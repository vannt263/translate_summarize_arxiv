    "pseudobulges are thought to be products of secular evolution ; but if it is so , then dynamical simulations ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pfenniger & friedli 1991 ) ) predict that they must have exponential brightness profiles .",
    "and indeed , small bulges of late - type spirals which could be easily made by secular evolution , practically all have exponential brightness profiles ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "but it is not only small bulges in late - type spirals that have exponential brightness profiles .",

    "in fact , it is quite natural because the very event of a s0 galaxy transformation from a spiral must include various processes of secular evolution resulting in matter re - distribution over the radius and bulge reshaping .",
    "but galactic disks outside the bulges can also consist of several exponential segments .",
    "now it becomes clear that so called anti - truncated disks consisting of two exponential segments with the outer scalelengths larger than the inner ones , may be the dominant type of galactic disks among some types of galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "can we distinguish the compact inner disk from a pseudobulge ?",
    "yes , by using multi - variant approach .",
    "for example , in ngc  7742 all spirals and current star formation are confined to the inner exponential disk , and the outer one is smooth and featureless ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* silchenko & moiseev 2006 ) ) , so we can conclude that the inner exponential stellar component is dynamically cold and can not be a bulge .",
    "but the key property is a visible geometry of the stellar component with the exponential profile . to be a disk",
    ", it must be thin . for disks inclined to the line of sight ,",
    "a good check is isophotal analysis .",
    "the outer disk is always assumed to be thin : then its isophote axis ratio characterizes the cosine of the inclination . if the inner component has the same visible axis ratio as the outer one and if two disks are coplanar , the inner structure can not be a spheroid , it must be a disk .",
    "for face - on galaxies , this approach does not work : their isophotes are always round independently of the scaleheights .",
    "but for face - on galaxies we can use kinematical data and estimate their thickness by measuring vertical stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "we have now started a program of studying systematically multi - tiers ( anti - truncated ) exponential structures in early - type , presumably lenticular , galaxies .",
    "the study will include photometric as well as spectral observations .",

    "the exposure times were selected in accordance with the surface brightness of the targets observed ; for example , we exposed ngc  524 itself during 60 sec in the @xmath2-filter and during 30 sec in the @xmath7-filter . as a flat field",
    ", we used the exposures of the twilight sky .",
    "the calibration onto the standard johnson @xmath8 system has been made by using multi - aperture photoelectric data collected by hyperleda for ngc  80 and ngc  524 .",

    "the data are rather precise , and we trace the profiles up to @xmath12 , or about 10 kpc from the center , with the accuracy better than 0.01 mag . at larger radii",

    "this colour difference , @xmath31 , may be resulted from a metallicity difference of 0.2 dex under the old stellar age @xmath32 gyr , or on the contrary from an age difference of 8 gyr under the metallicity of [ z / h]@xmath33 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the very similar surface brightness profile consisting of two exponential disks and of a very compact bulge has been observed by us earlier in the giant lenticular galaxy ngc  80 , which is also settled at the center of a rich x - ray group ( ( * ? ? ? * silchenko et al .",

    "both galaxies are seen face - on and are certainly unbarred ; the low ellipticity of their isophotes over the full radial extension proves that the galaxies are strictly axisymmetric . if the exponential inner stellar structures have been formed by secular evolution , where are signatures of the main ` driver ' of secular evolution , of a bar ?",
    "[ n524cvet ]",
    "it seems clear that anti - truncated disks are to be a result of matter re - distribution along the radius of a disk galaxy , and the very event of re - distribution must be rather fast and discrete .",
    "several candidate mechanisms can be proposed .",

    "* younger et al .",

    "the outer part of the multi - tiers stellar disk in the merger remnant seems to be a low surface brightness disk .",
    "some years ago i proposed another mechanism where a transient interaction , due to , say , by - pass of a rather massive galaxy , provokes intense gas inflow and results in gas concentration in the very inner part of a galaxy with the subsequent star formation burst . in the frame of this model , the inner disk must be more bright and compact than the usual large - scale stellar disks of spiral galaxies are .",
    "we may expect that an observational statistics of the parameters of inner and outer exponential disks in the anti - truncated galaxies would help to select a model .    in the group",
    "ngc  80 , besides the central galaxy , we have analysed brightness profiles in more 10 lenticular galaxies , with the absolute blue magnitudes from 17 to 20 . among those ,",
    "7 s0s have appeared to possess two - tiers exponential disks . and",
    "among 7 s0 galaxies with the two - tiers disks , three have the inner compact disks and the outer normal disks , and four have the inner normal disks and the outer lsb ones . together with ngc  80 itself and with ngc  524 , with their inner compact bright disks and extended normal ones , we obtain half - to - half preliminary statistics which implies that the origin of the multi - tiers exponential disks may be different in different galaxies .",
    "if we assume that multi - tiers exponential profiles are formed by secular evolution of galactic disks , the best place to search for them would be lenticular galaxies .",
    "lenticulars galaxies had to reform secularly their stellar disks during their transformation from s to s0 ; hence s0s must be the hosts of both multi - tiers disks and pseudobulges . to select a particular mechanism of forming anti - truncated disks , we must know better the statistics of their properties which are not still collected over representative samples . among the possible alternatives of the origin of multi - tiers exponential profiles",
    "there are minor merger versus tides ( but the same alternative exists for the origin of s0s beyond clusters ! ) . to choose",
    ", we need to know a balance between compact@xmath35normal and normal@xmath35lsb stellar disk combinations .    secular redistribution of stars and other matter in disks is thought to be made by bars : bars are usually generated by any interaction and even without interactions  by intrinsic instabilities .",
    "but almost all our galaxies with the multi - tiers disks are unbarred ; the face - on s0s ngc  524 and ngc  80 are perfectly axisymmetric . and the samples of erwin et al .",
    "( ( * ? ? ? * erwin et al .",

    "* erwin et al . 2008b ) ) imply the same conclusion : among barred galaxies , the anti - truncated disks contribute one third of all , among unbarred  more than 50% .",
