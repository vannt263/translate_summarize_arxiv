    "in chaos theory , it is important to study the stability of the equilibria of an autonomous dynamical system . for a dynamical system described by a set of autonomous ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , @xmath0 , if @xmath1 has real solution then @xmath2 is called the _ equilibrium _ of this dynamical system .",
    "an equilibrium is said to be _ hyperbolic _ if all eigenvalues of the system jacobian matrix have non - zero real parts . a hyperbolic equilibrium for three - dimensional ( 3d ) autonomous system can be a _",
    "node _ , _ saddle _",
    ", _ node - focus _ or _ saddle - focus_. for 3d autonomous hyperbolic type of dynamical systems , a commonly accepted criterion for proving the existence of chaos is due to ilnikov @xcite .",
    "it has also been noticed that although most chaotic systems are of hyperbolic type , there are still many others that are not so . for non - hyperbolic type of chaotic systems , they usually do not have saddle - focus equilibria , such as those found by sprott @xcite .",
    "the well - known lorenz system @xcite and also chen system @xcite both have two unstable saddle - foci and one unstable node .",
    "they can generate a two - wing butterfly - shaped chaotic attractor .",
    "near the center of the two wings , there lies one an unstable saddle - focus . in recent years",
    ", some chaotic systems are found which can generate three - wing , four - wing , and even multi - wing attractors .",
    "observe that , typically , for those symmetrical four - wing attractors , near the center of their wings there also lies one unstable saddle - focus .",
    "this common feature may imply that the number of equilibria basically determines the shape of a multi - wing attractor .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to ask : is it possible to generate a chaotic system with an arbitrarily preassigned number of equilibria ? is the number of equilibria always determinate the shape of an attractor ?",
    "furthermore , regarding the stability of the equilibria , recall that recently yang and chen found a chaotic system with one saddle and two stable node - foci @xcite , and an unusual 3d autonomous quadratic lorenz - like chaotic system with only two stable node - foci @xcite .",
    "moreover , wang and chen found an interesting chaotic system with only one stable node - focus @xcite .",
    "thus , another interesting question is whether it is possible for a chaotic system to have two , or three , or even an arbitrarily large number of stable / unstable equilibria ?",
    "this paper attempts to answer these questions by showing a novel example of a chaotic system with no equilibrium , and several other examples of chaotic systems which have any preassigned number of equilibria .",
    "meanwhile it is shown that , by adjusting the only parameter in these systems , one can also control the stability of these equilibria .",
    "first , a 3d chaotic autonomous system system is introduced : @xmath3    ) , which has two symmetrical equilibria when @xmath4 : 3d views on the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , @xmath5-@xmath7 plane and @xmath6-@xmath7 plane.,width=604 ]    , which has no equilibrium when @xmath8 ; 3d views on the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , @xmath5-@xmath7 plane and @xmath6-@xmath7 plane.,width=604 ]    ) with respect to the parameter @xmath9 . , width=377 ]    when @xmath10 , this system has two symmetrical equilibria : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as shown by fig .

    "when @xmath13 , these two symmetrical equilibria merge into one , the origin @xmath14 . when @xmath15 , there is no equilibrium in this system , but still , the system can generate a chaotic attractor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 02 ] . the largest lyapunov exponent with respect to the parameter @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ 03 ] , which convincingly implies that the system is chaotic .",
    "now , a chaotic system with only one equilibrium , a stable node - focus , is introduced , which was reported in @xcite .",
    "this system was found by modifying the sprott e system , as follows : @xmath16    when @xmath13 , it is the sprott e system @xcite ; when @xmath17 , however , the stability of the single equilibrium is fundamentally different .    specifically , when @xmath10 , system ( [ wangeq ] ) possesses only one stable equilibrium : @xmath18    ) , when @xmath19 ; 3d views on the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , @xmath5-@xmath7 plane and @xmath6-@xmath7 plane.,width=604 ]    some numerical calculation results are shown in table 1 .     @xmath20&@xmath21,@xmath22 + @xmath23&@xmath24 , @xmath25 + @xmath26&@xmath27 +    interestingly , this system ( [ wangeq ] ) can generate a one - scroll chaotic attractor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 0063d ] .    in the following , this system ( [ wangeq ] )",
    "is further modified by imposing some kind of symmetry onto it , to have different numbers of equilibria while keeping this system chaotic .",

    "[ 0063d ] , one can see that the @xmath6-axis does not intersect with the attractor in system ( [ wangeq ] ) .",
    "so , one may try to add a @xmath6-axis rotation symmetry to this system , as detailed below .",
    "consider the following simple coordinate transformation : @xmath30this transformation can add a @xmath6-axis rotation symmetry , @xmath31 , to the original system , because for each @xmath32 there are two points @xmath33 corresponding to @xmath32 .",

    "yet one can control the stability of these equilibria by adjusting the parameter @xmath9 , so that the stability remains the same as the original system ( [ wangeq ] ) which , when @xmath15 are unstable and when @xmath10 are stable .    by linearizing system ( [ wangeq ] ) at @xmath35 , one obtains the jacobian @xmath37\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose characteristic equation is @xmath38 which yields @xmath39    system ( [ chaos2 ] ) can generate a symmetrical two - petal chaotic attractor , as shown in fig .",
