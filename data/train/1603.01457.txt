    "the black hole entropy obtained by famous formula @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the area of the event horizon @xcite .",
    "this is the maximum entropy contained by any object of the same volume @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that a maximum entropy has to be associated with the black holes to prevent the violation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , if a black hole did not have any entropy , then the entropy of the universe would spontaneous reduce when any object crosses the horizon .",
    "the observation that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area has led to the development of the holographic principle  @xcite .",
    "this principle equates the degrees of freedom in a region of space with the degrees of freedom on the boundary of that region .",
    "+ even though the holographic principle is expected to hold for large regions of space , it is expected to get violated near the planck scale @xcite .",
    "this violation of the holographic principle occurs due to the quantum fluctuations in the geometry of space - time .",
    "as these quantum fluctuations are expected to dominate the geometry of space - time near the planck scale , it is expected that the holographic principle will be violated near the planck scale .",
    "thus , the relation between the area and entropy of a black hole is also expected to get modified near the planck scale .",
    "in fact , the quantum fluctuations in the geometry of the black hole will lead to the thermal fluctuations in the black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it will be possible to neglect these thermal fluctuations for the large black holes .",
    "however , as the black holes reduce in size due to the radiation of the hawking radiation , the quantum fluctuations in the geometry of the black hole will increase .",
    "thus , the thermal fluctuations will start to modify the thermodynamics of the black holes as the black holes reduce in size .",
    "it is possible to calculate the correction terms generated from such thermal fluctuations .",
    "the correction terms generated from these thermal fluctuations are logarithmic functions of the original thermodynamic quantities .",
    "+ the corrections to the black hole thermodynamics have been obtained using the density of microstates for asymptotically flat black holes @xcite .",
    "this was done by using a formalism called the non - perturbative quantum general relativity . in this formalism , the density of states for a black hole was associated with the conformal blocks of a well defined conformal field theory . it was demonstrated that even though the leading order relation between the entropy and area of a black hole is the standard bekenstein entropy - area relation , this formalism also generated logarithmic corrections terms to the standard bekenstein entropy - area relation .",
    "it has also been demonstrated using the cardy formula that the logarithmic correction terms are generated for all black holes whose microscopic degrees of freedom are described by a conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "matter fields have been studied in the presence of a black hole , and this analysis has also generated logarithmic correction terms for the bekenstein entropy - area formula @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic correction terms are also generated from string theoretical effects @xcite .",
    "the corrections term for the entropy of a dilatonic black holes has been calculated @xcite .",
    "it was found that this correction term is again a logarithmic functions of the original thermodynamic quantities .",
    "such correction terms have also been generated using a rademacher expansion of the partition function @xcite .",
    "so , it seems that such logarithmic corrections terms occur almost universally .",
    "+ the singularity at the center of black holes indicates a breakdown of general theory of relativity , as it can not be gauged away by coordinate transformations .",
    "however , it is possible to construct black holes which are regular and do not contain an singularity at the center .",
    "the hayward black hole is an example of such regular black hole as it does not contain a singularity at the center @xcite .",
    "these black holes have been analyzed using various modifications of the chaplygin gas formalism @xcite .",
    "the motion of a particle in background of a hayward black hole also has been discussed @xcite .",
    "the massive scalar quasinormal modes of the hayward black hole have been studied @xcite .",
    "in fact , the one - loop quantum corrections to the newton potential for these regular black holes has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "recently , the accretion of fluid flow around the modified hayward black hole have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of particles in presence of a rotating modified hayward black hole has also been investigated @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on thermodynamics of a modified hayward black hole .",
    "the most general spherically symmetric , static line element describing modified hayward black hole can be written as @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the black hole mass , @xmath6 is the hubble length which is related to the cosmological constant , @xmath7 is a positive constants and @xmath8 is related with the cosmological constant @xcite . in the ref .",
    "@xcite it is found that @xmath9 .",
    "we will find lower bounds for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 using the thermodynamics description .",
    "+ the horizon radius of the black hole can be found by the real positive root of the following equation , @xmath10 so , one can obtain the black hole mass in terms of the horizon radius as follows , @xmath11 which implies that @xmath12 . for simplicity we set @xmath13 .",
    "then , the equation ( [ c4 ] ) has a solution as follow , @xmath14 where , @xmath15 which gives an upper bound for the black hole mass , @xmath16 for the special case of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , the event horizon radius reduces to @xmath19 .",
    "+ an important thermodynamic quantity is the entropy which is related to the black hole horizon area , @xmath20 also , volume of the black hole is given by , @xmath21 temperature of modified hayward black hole can be written as , @xmath22_{r = r_{+}}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\frac{r_{+}^{3}-4m}{2mr_{+}^{3}}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\alpha\\beta m}{\\alpha r_{+}^{3}+\\beta m}},\\ ] ] where the black hole mass @xmath5 is given by the equation ( [ c5 ] ) and black hole horizon radius is given by the equation ( [ c6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can investigate thermodynamics of black hole in terms of either black hole mass or radius associated with the event horizon .",
    "now , the temperature of the black hole can be simplified to the another form , @xmath23 there are two conditions to have real positive temperature , @xmath24 both conditions satisfied simultaneously if we have , @xmath25 it shows that @xmath9 is necessary to have positive @xmath8 , as illustrated by ref .",
    "if we assume integer values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , quickly we find @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are corresponding to the zero - temperature limit , and both conditions of ( [ t1 - 1-c1 ] ) are the same .",
    "the case of @xmath29 yields to ordinary hayward black hole @xcite with the temperature given by , @xmath30 which reduces to @xmath31 for the large values of horizon radius ( asymptotic behavior ) . the pressure can be obtained by @xmath32 it is interesting to investigate the first law of thermodynamic @xcite , @xmath33 other terms are corresponding to the black hole rotation and charge which are absent in our model .",
    "it is easy to check that the equation ( [ t4 ] ) violates . in order for thermodynamic quantities",
    "satisfy above relation , we have two solutions : the first is to add rotation or charge to the black hole , the second is consideration of logarithmic correction .",
    "it is possible to calculate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of modified hayward black hole .",
    "one can write the partition function of the system as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the euclidean action for this system @xcite .",
    "it is possible to relate it to the partition function in the statistical mechanical as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inverse of the temperature .",
    "the partition function can be used to calculate the density of states @xmath38 where @xmath39 the entropy around the equilibrium temperature @xmath40 can be obtained by neglecting all the thermal fluctuations . however ,",
    "if thermal fluctuations are taken into account , then @xmath41 , can be written as @xmath42 so , the density of states can be written as @xmath43 thus , we obtain @xmath44^{1/2}.\\ ] ] so , we can write @xmath45^{1/2}.\\ ] ] this expression can be simplified using the relation between the microscopic degrees of freedom of a black hole and a conformal field theory .",
    "this is because using this relation , the entropy can be assumed to the form , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are positive constants @xcite .",
    "this has an extremum at @xmath48 and so we can expand the entropy around this extremum @xmath49(a_{1}^n a_{2}^m)^{1/(m+n ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}[(m+n ) m^{(n+2)/(m+n ) } n^{(m-2)/(m+n ) } ] ( a_{1}^{n+2}a_{2}^{m-2})^{{1}/(m+n)}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times ( \\beta_{\\kappa } - \\beta_{0\\kappa})^2 , \\label{a2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we can write @xmath50 it is possible to solve for @xmath51 and express the entropy as @xmath52 where @xmath53.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the factor @xmath54 can be absorbed using some redefinition as it does not depend on the black hole parameters @xcite .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath55 so , the corrected value of the entropy can be written as @xmath56 we can write a general expression for the entropy as @xmath57 where we introduced a parameter @xmath58 by hand to track corrected terms , so in the limit @xmath59 , the original results can be recovered and @xmath60 yields usual corrections @xcite . by using the temperature and entropy given by the equations ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) respectively , we can obtain the following corrected entropy , @xmath61.\\ ] ] it is clear that the logarithmic correction reduce the entropy of the black hole .",
    "we can obtain the entropy at zero - temperature using appropriate choice of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , @xmath62 as we mentioned already , both zero - temperature conditions ( [ t1 - 1-c1 ] ) are the same for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "so , @xmath63 is zero - temperature condition where entropy ( [ l2 - 1 ] ) become infinite .",
    "the fact is that at the zero - temperature limit , thermal fluctuations vanish and we should set @xmath64 .",
    "it is clear from the equation ( [ l1 ] ) , so at the zero - temperature limit we have @xmath65 .",
    "+ we can calculate pressure using the ( [ t2 ] ) , ( [ t3 ] ) , ( [ t1 ] ) and following relation , @xmath66 in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we can analyze the behavior of pressure for various values of parameters .",
    "comparing dashed line and dotted line , we can find that the logarithmic correction decrease the pressure .",
    "using the higher values for the black hole mass from the relation ( [ c8 ] ) , we find zero pressure around the black hole horizon .",
    "higher values of the mass yields to negative pressure . for all cases with @xmath67",
    ", we can see positive pressure , which yields to zero as @xmath68 , it is clearly expected that vanished black hole has no thermodynamics pressure .    .",

    "then , using the well known relation , @xmath70 we can obtain inner energy which decreased dramatically due to the logarithmic corrections .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be used to obtain the specific heat at constant volume , @xmath73 calculation of @xmath74 and @xmath75 help us to obtain specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath76 so , we can investigate @xmath77 numerically . from the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is illustrated that , for the large horizon radius , @xmath78 .",

    "we draw three curves corresponding to each @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we see that , at least , there are two points where the first law of thermodynamic is satisfied .",
    "cross points of the red ( solid ) and blue ( dashed ) curves states @xmath87 which means validity of the relation ( [ t4 ] ) .",

    "one of the best ways to find instability of a black hole is studied the sign of the specific heat given by the equation ( [ l5 - 0 ] ) .",

    "we give graphical analysis of the specific heat which illustrated in fig .",
    "we can demonstrate that various cases of the black hole may be stable for the case of @xmath96 .",
    "it is clear that the modified hayward black hole with logarithmic correction of entropy is stable for @xmath97 .",
