    "since the pioneering work by colgate and white ( 1966 ) , detailed studies of the dynamics of collapse - driven supernovae have been done mainly with numerical simulations ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "one of the difficulties in so doing is the remarkable contrast between the dynamical time scale of the nascent neutron star ( @xmath2msec ) and the diffusion time scale of neutrinos ( @xmath3sec ) .",
    "if we want to simulate the whole scenario of the collapse - driven supernovae , these time scales should be treated simultaneously .",
    "since the typical time scale of weak interactions ( @xmath4sec ) is much smaller than the dynamical time scale , the neutrino transfer has been treated in implicit ways in general .",
    "the hydrodynamics , however , has been calculated chiefly by explicit schemes , so that the time steps are restricted by the courant condition and a large number of integration steps are required to simulate the late stage of collapse - driven supernovae .",
    "two approaches have been conceived to overcome such severely limited time steps .",
    "the first one is to implement an algorithm of individual time steps in the explicit difference scheme ( @xcite ) , in which the time steps at different positions are allowed to be different from one another and are determined from the local courant condition .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it is easily applied to multi - dimensional simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "the implicit difference scheme is another possibility , since the time step is not restricted by the courant condition , though the required accuracy of calculation will limit the time step .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that the number of operations per each time step becomes much larger than in the corresponding explicit scheme , particularly in multi - dimensional simulations .",
    "hence , it is of no use unless we can take time steps large enough to make up for its larger operation number .",
    "however , note that the nascent neutron star , whose dynamical time scale limits the time step in the explicit schemes , evolves in a nearly hydrostatic manner so that it might be possible to take large enough time steps in this case . note also that an advantage of implicit hydrodynamic schemes in the simulation of collapse - drive supernovae is that the neutrino transfer schemes are generally coded in implicit fashions so that the hydrodynamic parts are easily incorporated into the neutrino parts .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide such an implicit scheme from the latter stand point .",
    "such attempts have already been made by schinder et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and swesty ( 1995 ) .",
    "their schemes use almost the same equation set as that of may & white ( 1967 ) , which has been frequently used in explicit general relativistic calculations ( note , however , that schinder et al .",
    "extended it to polar - slicing coordinates ) .",
    "their codes also need artificial viscosities . on the other hand , for the present scheme we tried to apply a so - called godunov - type differencing method ( @xcite and references therein ) , which has been extensively utilized for the multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations these days .",
    "since we have evaluated the pressure and velocity at a cell interface using the solution of the linearized advection equations , this code is an extension of roe s scheme .",
    "thanks to the numerical diffusion induced implicitly by finite differencing , this code needs no artificial viscosity like most of the recent elaborate euler schemes .",
    "in addition , it is quite robust .",
    "in fact , as shown later , the calculation does not collapse even if we take time steps much larger than the courant limit , ( though the results become less accurate ) .",
    "this paper is not aiming at the general application of roe s scheme to general relativistic hydrodynamics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the coordinates and the metric we use here are fully reduced ones under the assumption of spherical symmetry so that the degree of time slicing does not remain at all .",
    "the equation set is also so chosen that they look similar to the nonrelativistic counter parts in these coordinates .",
    "instead , the final goal of this project is to study the neutrino physics in collapse - driven supernovae by combining this code with sophisticated neutrino transfer codes .",
    "recently , many researchers in this field have considered that the key factors of successful explosions are neutrino and multi - dimensional hydrodynamical effects such as convection ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is true that the spherical simulations can not treat such multi - dimensional effects properly , but we think that they can play a complementary role to multi - dimensional simulations since multi - dimensional simulations use a more approximate treatment of neutrino transport than in spherical calculations . at present",
    "we are trying to incorporate this hydrodynamical code into the multi - group flux - limited diffusion code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the coding of the boltzmann solver has also been undertaken .",
    "this paper is the first step of the project .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "the details of the formulations and the schemes are described in the next section .",
    "the results of the test calculations are shown in the section 3 .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in the final section .",
    "spherical symmetry of the system is assumed and the following form of the metric is used : @xmath5 in the above formula @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the velocity of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , which are taken to be unity in the following equations .",
    "@xmath8 is the coordinate time and @xmath9 is the baryon mass coordinate which is related to the circumference radius @xmath10 through the conservation law of baryon mass as described below .",
    "this form of the metric is so simple that it has been frequently adopted in the spherically symmetric simulations thus far .",
    "however , this way of time slicing is not suitable for the study of black hole formation ( see @xcite ) . since our purpose is to investigate the supernova dynamics leading to proto - neutron star formation , that is not a serious problem .",
    "the basic equations consist of the einstein equations obtained from the above metric : @xmath11 and the euler equations : @xmath12 with the baryon number conservation equation : @xmath13 and the evolution equation of electron fraction ( see below ) . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the einstein tensor and the energy - momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the baryon mass density and @xmath17 is the four velocity of the matter . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the specific internal energy density and the matter pressure , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is the inverse of the metric tensor @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to these equations , the neutrino transfer equations should be implemented finally , but they are dropped in this paper . for this reason , the source term which evolves the electron fraction",
    "is not included in the present calculations .",
    "first i will write down the hydrodynamic equations with those representing the baryon number conservation and the evolution of electron fraction .",
    "they are formulated as follows : @xmath22 in the above equations , @xmath23 is the inverse of the baryon mass density , and @xmath24 is the radial fluid velocity .",
    "@xmath25 is the general relativistic gamma factor which is defined below ( equation ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) ) and is solved simultaneously .",
    "@xmath26 is the specific enthalpy which is also defined below ( equation ( [ eqn : enth ] ) ) and is treated as the dependent variable to be solved .",
    "@xmath27 is the gravitational mass inside the radius of @xmath10 and should be distinguished from the baryon mass coordinate @xmath9 .",
    "the second representation of the energy conservation ( [ eqn : energy ] ) looks peculiar .",
    "this form of the equation declares explicitly that we get the internal energy density by solving the equation of the total energy conservation of the fluid ( in the newtonian limit ) and then extracting the kinetic energy and the gravitational energy from it rather than using the simpler form ( [ eqn : simene ] ) which is just the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "both forms of the energy equation are tried in the shock tube calculations and it is found that the latter form ( [ eqn : energy ] ) better reproduces the rankine - hugoniot relation . this is a well known fact in the eulerian numerical simulations . note that the artificial viscosity is not necessary in both cases for the finite difference scheme described below .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are quantities related with neutrinos .",
    "they are defined as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34 is the energy - momentum tensor of neutrinos and @xmath16 is the baryon mass density . @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the energy density , the flux vector and the stress tensor of neutrinos .",
    "the right hand sides of equations ( [ eqn : ye ] ) and ( [ eqn : qa ] ) are the phase space integrals of the collision term in the neutrino boltzmann equations .",
    "although these terms are included in the above equations for completeness , they are omitted in the present calculations . in particular , the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn : ye ] ) is set to be zero , so that @xmath38 in all of the computations below . equation ( [ eqn : rcub ] ) relates the radius and the baryon mass inside it and is obtained from the combination of the baryon number conservation equation ( [ eqn : bary ] ) and the definition of @xmath25 below ( equation ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) ) .",
    "this equation is used to determine @xmath39 of the next step instead of @xmath40 , which has been often used so far .",
    "it should be noted that the above equations are very similar to the newtonian counterparts . as a result ,",
    "the difference scheme developed for the newtonian system can be applied to the above general relativistic system .",
    "the rest of the basic equations specify the metric components @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the gamma factor @xmath43 , the gravitational mass @xmath44 and the specific enthalpy @xmath45 .",
    "these equations are : @xmath46 as is clear , these are not evolutionary equations except for equation ( [ eqn : gravm ] ) , but are constraint equations which must be satisfied at each time step .",
    "since the present scheme is written in the implicit form , these constraints are always satisfied within the error for convergence of iteration .",
    "the equation for the gravitational mass @xmath47 can be written in the constraint form as well : @xmath48\\ , \\frac{\\partial \\ ,",
    "r}{\\partial m } \\quad .\\ ] ] however , equation ( [ eqn : gravm ] ) is adopted here rather than ( [ eqn : const ] ) , since it explicitly guarantees the total energy conservation @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the stellar core radius , as long as the energy loss due to the emission of neutrinos is disregarded .",
    "the constraint equation ( [ eqn : const ] ) is used for the check of the accuracy of calculations .",
    "the terms concerning the interactions of neutrinos are included in the above equations also , but are dropped in the present simulations again .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : enth ] ) is nothing but the definition of specific enthalpy .",
    "usually , this expression is expanded in the preceding equations .",
    "however , it is treated as one of the dependent variables to be solved simultaneously in this code , since it avoids the repeated appearance of the derivatives of @xmath26 in the matrix elements .",
    "this treatment means that the specific enthalpy does not satisfy the above definition strictly during the iteration process .",
    "this did not cause any serious problem in the test calculations shown below .",
    "moreover it increases cpu time very little . it should be noticed that the most time consuming part in the radiative hydrodynamics code is the neutrino transfer subroutine . in order to integrate equation ( [ eqn : gravpot ] ) we must specify the boundary condition for @xmath51 .",
    "it is done so that the metric in the stellar core coincides at the surface of the stellar core with the schwarzschild metric for a spherically symmetric vacuum : @xmath52 where the subscript @xmath53 means the variables are evaluated at the surface of the stellar core . strictly speaking ,",
    "the metric outside the stellar core is not the schwarzschild metric because neutrinos exist there . for simplicity ,",
    "however , the above approximation is adopted in the following calculations .",
    "to summarize , the basic equations to be solved are equations ( [ eqn : dens ] ) through ( [ eqn : rcub ] ) and ( [ eqn : lmbd ] ) through ( [ eqn : enth ] ) . the latter form ( [ eqn : energy ] )",
    "is used for the energy conservation equation as stated above .",
    "the boundary condition is given as equation ( [ eqn : bndc ] ) .",
    "these equations are differenced in the implicit method described in the next section .",
    "the resulting equations are the simultaneous equations consisting of @xmath54 ( mesh number ) equations .",
    "the matrix to be inversed has a block - tridiagonal form .",
    "all the dependent variables except @xmath10 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 are defined at the mesh centers as in most of the recent eulerian schemes .",
    "the values at the cell interfaces for pressure and velocity are calculated by using the solutions of the linearized riemann problems as described below .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 are placed at the edges of meshes in order to simplify the integrals ( equation ( [ eqn : gravpot ] ) ) and the implementation of the boundary condition ( equation ( [ eqn : bndc ] ) ) . the superscripts and the subscripts attached to the variables in the following difference equations are representing the time step and the mesh number , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the mesh centers are specified by the lower case subscript like @xmath55 , on the other hand to the interfaces attached are the uppercase subscript like @xmath56 , and that all these subscripts are integers .",
    "it follows that @xmath57-th mesh center ( @xmath58 ) is located between the @xmath59-th and @xmath60-th interfaces ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , there is one exception .",
    "@xmath62 s are defined on the @xmath59-th interfaces .",
    "this is because the boundary condition of @xmath51 ( equation ( [ eqn : bndc ] ) ) is specified on the surface of the iron core ( @xmath63-th interface ) .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath10 and @xmath47 , for which the inner boundary conditions : @xmath64 and @xmath65 are assumed implicitly and we do nt have to solve them .    paying attention to these assumptions , we will first see the finite differenced equations regarding the @xmath57-th mesh and @xmath60-th interface ( but @xmath59-th interface only for @xmath51 ) : @xmath66    @xmath67    in the above equations it is supposed that the time step @xmath68 corresponds to the present time , where all the values of the dependent variables are known .",
    "the above finite differenced equations form nonlinearly coupled simultaneous equations .",
    "the newton - raphson scheme is used to solve these equations .",
    "some averaging procedures are abbreviated like @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "their definitions are as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is assumed to be defined at the cell center or at the cell interface while @xmath74 is supposed to be defined at the cell edge .",
    "@xmath75 is actually the radius @xmath10 .",
    "note that we distinguish two velocities @xmath76 and @xmath77 and two pressures @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the latter of which are determined from the linearized riemann problems which are evaluated at the time step @xmath80 , where the values of the dependent variables should be solved .",
    "that is , we consider the riemann problems at each cell interface @xmath56 at each time step @xmath80 , the left and right constant states of which are given by ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) and ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) , respectively .",
    "we solve these problems approximately by linearizing the advection equations as described below .",
    "it should be noted again that these constant states are evaluated at the time step @xmath80 , so that we can not know them a priori .",
    "hence we must solve these riemann problems at each iteration step of newton - raphson methods .",
    "the physical meaning of the interface values obtained in this way is rather obscure compared with the counterparts in explicit schemes , since the exact solution of the riemann problem describes the interaction of the nonlinear wave _ after _ the time of the initial condition ( the time step @xmath80 ) .",
    "the interpretation here is that they approximate the states after the interactions of nonlinear waves during the time steps @xmath68 to @xmath80 .",
    "practically , these values are given as follows .",
    "if we pay attention only to the advection terms , then we get @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the adiabatic index and is defined as : @xmath89 in equation ( [ eqn : jacob ] ) , the dependent variable is changed from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the eigen vectors are very simple in this representation : +   + where @xmath90 s are the eigen values , and @xmath91 s and @xmath92 s are the corresponding right and left eigen vectors . in this equations",
    ", @xmath93 is the sound velocity defined as : @xmath94 as in the newtonian hydrodynamics , there are three modes , two of which correspond to the left- and right - going sound waves and the rest of which represents the contact discontinuity . in this representation , it is clear that pressure and velocity are continuous across the contact discontinuity .",
    "this feature is taken over to the solution of the linearized riemann problems when these eigenvectors are used to solve them .",
    "it is not the case when other dependent variables are chosen .",
    "this is the second reason to use these variables . in order to linearize equation ( [ eqn : jacob ] )",
    "we just replace the jacobian matrix by some constant matrix at each cell interface . in this paper , arithmetically averaged @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are used to evaluate the constant matrix , where the subscripts @xmath98 and @xmath50 mean that they are evaluated at the left and right constant states of each riemann problem , respectively .",
    "the eigen values and the corresponding left and right eigen vectors given above are also evaluated in terms of these averaged variables at each cell interface .",
    "the linearized advection equations thus obtained can be solved analytically . @xmath99 and @xmath100 evaluated in this way",
    "prove to be as follows : @xmath101 where the subscript @xmath9 means they should be evaluated by using the above averaged variables .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath102 is different from the arithmetic mean of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "as is clear , both @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the arithmetic mean of the left- and right - state values with the correction terms which are proportional to @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "these correction terms serve as a numerical diffusion so that no artificial viscosity is necessary .",
    "the above representations of the velocity and the pressure at the cell interface are so simple that it is quite easy to evaluate their derivatives with respect to the dependent variables in the course of the newton - raphson scheme .    in the present code , in order to achieve spatial second order accuracy , the piecewise linear distributions of dependent variables @xmath16 , @xmath107 , @xmath18 and @xmath25 are introduced .",
    "it is well known that some limiting procedure is necessary to maintain the monotonicity of the numerical solution . in this paper",
    ", we use the simplest slope prescription : if @xmath108 and @xmath109 denote the left- and right - hand difference quotients of the above dependent variables , the slopes @xmath110 are determined by the formula @xmath111 where the superscript @xmath57 distinguishes the dependent variables @xmath16 , @xmath107 , @xmath18 and @xmath25 .",
    "this prescription will need some improvement in the future .",
    "the above finite differenced equations ( [ eqn : voldif ] ) through ( [ eqn : entdif ] ) with the definitions of interface values ( [ eqn : velint ] ) and ( [ eqn : presint ] ) form the system of the nonlinearly coupled simultaneous equations with respect to the dependent variables @xmath112 , @xmath107 , @xmath18 , @xmath113 , @xmath10 , @xmath90 , @xmath25 , @xmath51 , @xmath47 and @xmath26 . in order to solve these equations ,",
    "the standard newton - raphson iteration scheme is utilized for the linearized equations .",
    "that is , if we define the dependent variables vector as @xmath114 where the subscripts @xmath57 and @xmath60 mean the @xmath115th mesh and interface values , and denote all the equations in the vector representations as @xmath116 then the linearized equations become @xmath117 where @xmath118 is some guess for the correct @xmath119 .",
    "this linearized equation ( [ eqn : lnr ] ) is solved repeatedly while improving the guess by @xmath120 until the error @xmath121 becomes less than some small value which is set to @xmath122 in the following calculations .",
    "as is clear , the jacobian matrix @xmath123 turns out to be a block - tridiagonal matrix whose block size is @xmath124 . at each step of the above iteration , the linearized equations ( [ eqn : lnr ] )",
    "are solved by the standard gauss elimination scheme , though other elaborate schemes can be applied to this type of matrix .",
    "note , however , that the matrix for the hydrodynamic sector is very small compared with that for neutrinos .",
    "the implementation of such an efficient solver will be done at the next step , where the neutrino transfer code will be combined .    as stated above",
    ", the formulae for the velocity and the pressure at the cell interface ( equation ( [ eqn : velint ] ) are so simple that we can calculate their derivatives with regard to the dependent variables analytically . in so doing ,",
    "however , the contributions from the sloping prescription are dropped , which does not cause serious problems for convergence of the newton - raphson iteration process .",
    "the thermodynamic derivatives are obtained by differencing the eos table numerically , except for the adiabatic index @xmath88 , which is stored in the table .",
    "the time step is determined so that the change of any dependent variables should not exceed an appropriate upper limit , which is chosen to be 2% in most of the following calculations , at each time step . in order to save the computation time , however , we correct the next time step and do nt repeat the same time step even though the above criterion is not satisfied at some time step . in fact , if the change of some variable exceeds the above criterion , the subsequent time step is decreased by a factor of 0.95 . on the other hand , if none of the variations of the dependent variables exceeds the upper limit , then we multiply the next time step by 1.05 .",
    "the time variation of the courant number which is defined as : @xmath125 is monitored for all the calculations and is shown for some test calculations below .",
    "in the following , some results for the representative test problems are shown in order to clarify the performance of the present hydrodynamical code . among them",
    "there are shock tube problems both for non - relativistic and special relativistic cases , sedov s point explosion problem in the uniform matter , oppenheimer - snyder s dust collapse problem and the non - relativistic self - similar collapse of a @xmath1 polytrope .",
    "moreover , the results of the hydrostatic calculations and the simple adiabatic collapse simulations are demonstrated in order to judge whether the present code can be applied to the simulation for the late time stage of the collapse - driven supernovae . in order to compare the results , the parameter sets adopted here for the first five problems are almost the same as those studied by swesty . in the course of these simulations no special tuning to the specific problem",
    "is done except for the boundary conditions , the mesh system and the equation of state .",
    "the most standard parameter set for this problem is that proposed by sod ( 1978 ) : @xmath126 where the subscripts @xmath98 and @xmath50 mean the left- and right - state values and cgs units are assumed .",
    "the equation of state for this problem is @xmath127 with @xmath1 and @xmath128 .",
    "since the present code assumes spherically symmetric geometry , we formulate the problem , which is originally for plane symmetric geometry , over a thin shell whose curvature is safely ignored .",
    "following swesty , we take @xmath129 cm and @xmath130 cm for the radius and the thickness of the thin shell , respectively , and we define @xmath131 and specify the region @xmath132 as the left state .",
    "100 uniform meshes are used .",
    "although the calculations have been done both for @xmath133 and @xmath128 , only the results for @xmath134 are described since the features of the numerical solutions are nearly the same both qualitatively and quantitatively .    in figure  1 the representative distributions of @xmath16 , @xmath107 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 for @xmath134",
    "are shown with the corresponding analytic solutions .",
    "the time is 0.675sec ( 400 time steps ) .",
    "as can be seen , the shock is resolved by 3 meshes in the present case .",
    "moreover , no oscillations occur behind the shock and the rarefaction wave .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot condition is strictly satisfied without any artificial viscosity .",
    "however , we can see the small jump of the specific internal energy density ahead of the contact surface .",
    "this is not an oscillation but an erroneous contact surface .",
    "this can be understood from the smoothness of the velocity and the pressure at the contact surface .",
    "the approximate solution of the riemann problem is least accurate at the first time step , when the largest discontinuities exist .",
    "the observed incorrect jump of the specific internal energy density at the contact surface is the result of the inaccurate approximate solution at the first time step .",
    "since this scheme is lagrangian , the contact discontinuity is never smeared out at all once it is formed .",
    "however , this is not a serious problem in the simulation of the realistic core collapse , since even the contact surface between the iron core and the mantle spreads over a considerable distance and is not a strict discontinuity .",
    "the time steps for these calculations are controlled so that the maximum variation of any dependent variables does not exceed 2% . as a result",
    ", the courant number defined earlier is kept as large as 0.3 through the calculations .",
    "the calculation which allows the maximum variation of 15% has also been done in order to see the effect of time step control .",
    "the result shows the tendency to smear out the shock and the rarefaction wave .",
    "however , the effect is not so large in the non - relativistic case .",
    "this issue will be raised again in the next section .",
    "next shown are the numerical solutions for the following riemann problem : @xmath135 where the units are again cgs .",
    "this parameter set is the same as that used by swesty .",
    "we use 100 zones with an equal spatial resolution also in this case .",
    "the equation of state is again @xmath127 .",
    "figure  2 shows the distributions of density , velocity , pressure and specific internal energy density at the time of @xmath136sec ( 490 numerical steps ) .",
    "@xmath134 also in this case .",
    "as can be seen clearly , the rankine - hugoniot condition at the shock wave is satisfied very well .",
    "no oscillation occurs in this case , either , except for the one mesh just ahead of the contact discontinuity .",
    "the cause of this erroneous jump is the same as for the non - relativistic shock tube .",
    "since the initial discontinuity of the density is smaller in this case than in the previous case , the resulting error becomes smaller .",
    "one thing to be mentioned here is that the upper limit of the variation of the dependent variables is chosen to be 0.5% in this calculation so that the shock can be resolved in a few zones .",
    "the resultant courant number is @xmath0 . in order to see the effect of time steps on the resolution of the numerical solution ,",
    "we have done two other simulations varying the upper limit . in figure",
    "3 we show the results for the upper limit of 2% . the courant number is @xmath137 through the integration . as can be clearly seen , both the shock wave and the rarefaction wave are smeared out considerably .",
    "this trend is much more remarkable in figure  4 , which shows the results for an upper limit of 10% and the courant number is as large as 8 at the end of the calculation .",
    "it should be also noted that in this calculation the courant number is set to be 3 from the beginning . from these results",
    "it is concluded that although the present implicit scheme is stable for the courant number @xmath138 , in order to keep the resolution of the solution the maximum variation of the dependent variables must be chosen so that the courant number should be @xmath0 at the shock wave .",
    "however , note that this does not mean that this code can not not be applied to the realistic simulation of the collapse - driven supernovae , since what we should overcome is not the courant limit at the shock wave but the limit at the nascent neutron star . this issue will be discussed again in the section of adiabatic collapse calculation .",
    "the dimensional parameters which characterize the problem are the density of the uniform matter @xmath139 and the total energy of explosion @xmath140 .",
    "the problem , however , can be formulated in the completely non - dimensional form . hence the solutions with different initial parameters are equivalent to each other .",
    "we choose the following parameters for simplicity : @xmath141 where the units are cgs .",
    "the computational region is the sphere with the radius of 1 , and is covered by 100 equal baryon mass zones .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath142 .",
    "the calculation is initiated by depositing the total energy in the central mesh . for numerical convenience",
    "the uniform ambient matter has the specific internal energy density of @xmath143@xmath144/sec@xmath145 .",
    "this is justified since the ambient specific internal energy density is negligibly small compared with that of shocked matter .",
    "the results are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the shock is resolved by @xmath146 meshes also in this case , and the analytic solution is reproduced quite well in most of the computational region . in the central @xmath147 meshes , however , the numerical solution is not very good .",
    "this is because the mesh for this problem is uniform in baryon mass and the spatial resolution is not sufficient for the central region .",
    "it is well known that a non - relativistic gas with an adiabatic index of @xmath1 is neutrally stable against gravitational collapse .",
    "goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) found a solution of a self - similarly collapsing gas with @xmath1 .",
    "yahil ( 1983 ) generalized this solution to the collapse for different @xmath88 s .",
    "these self - similar solutions approximate the homologous collapse of the inner core of the collapse - driven supernovae .",
    "hence it is indispensable to the numerical schemes for the collapse - driven supernovae that they can reproduce this self - similar collapse .",
    "the initial condition is made as follows : assuming the polytropic equation of state @xmath148 with @xmath1 , we first solve the lane - emden equation . here",
    "we take @xmath149 as the value for the relativistically degenerate gas with electron fraction @xmath150 .",
    "the central density is set to be @xmath151g/@xmath152 .",
    "then we take out the inner 1m@xmath153 and reduce the internal energy uniformly so that the total energy becomes 0 .",
    "this reduction factor is nearly equal to the pressure deficit @xmath154 defined by goldreich - weber as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the homologous core mass which is set to be 1m@xmath153 in this model and the mass of the polytrope without pressure deficit , respectively .",
    "the computational region ( 1m@xmath153 ) is covered with 100 equal baryon mass zones also in this case .",
    "it is noted that the equation of state for simulation is ideal gas like ( @xmath158 ) with @xmath1 , not adiabatic ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "this is because we want to see how well the constancy of entropy is maintained in the course of the numerical integration .",
    "the results are shown in figure  6 , where the time variation is presented for density , velocity , pressure and the quantity proportional to entropy : @xmath159 . in this figure",
    ", the solid lines are just connecting the data for the same time step .",
    "when we pay attention to the velocity distribution , it is clear that most parts of the polytrope collapse homologously , that is , the infalling velocity is proportional to the radius .",
    "although it is not the case for the outer few zones , this is due to the boundary condition which is set by hand and is not consistent with the actual dynamics . in the actual simulation of the supernovae , this problem concerning the outer boundary condition should be avoided by locating the boundary at a sufficiently distant position . on the other hand",
    ", it is also found that the entropy distribution remains almost constant for most parts of the polytrope through the evolution .",
    "the exception is the outer few zones also in this case .",
    "ignoring these outer parts , we can find the maximum error of the entropy is about 8% at the innermost zone and about 5% for the other zones .",
    "the calculation is terminated when the central density reaches @xmath160g/@xmath152 after 600 time steps .",
    "the relativistic correction is @xmath161 at that time .",
    "the general relativistic collapse of uniform pressureless matter was analytically solved by oppenheimer & snyder .",
    "when we assume the matter is initially ( @xmath162 ) at rest with the uniform density @xmath163 and the radius @xmath164 , then the subsequent motion is described parametrically as follows : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is varied from 0 to @xmath167 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the above @xmath168 is the proper time for each mass element and should be distinguished from the coordinate time @xmath8 .",
    "the boundary condition for the coordinate time @xmath8 is not altered in this simulation , they are related to each other by @xmath169 the time coordinate in figure  7 is the coordinate time @xmath8 which is obtained by numerically integrating equation  ( [ eqn : time ] ) . however , the difference is not significant except for the final few msec .",
    "note also that in this time coordinate it takes infinite time for the mass shell to reach the event horizon .",
    "however , it is not a serious problem , as stated earlier , since the main purpose of this code is to study the process to produce a neutron star .",
    "following swesty , we take 2m@xmath153 cloud with a uniform density of @xmath170g/@xmath152 for the initial model .",
    "since the present code can not handle zero - pressure , we use the polytropic equation of state @xmath171 with @xmath1 and negligibly small @xmath149 .",
    "this initial configuration is covered with 160 equal baryon mass meshes .",
    "the calculation is terminated after 3000 time steps when the central density reaches @xmath172g/@xmath152 .    in figure  7 , the motions of the representative mass elements are shown .",
    "the solid lines are exact solutions in this case .",
    "as shown in this figure , the coincidence between the numerical solution and the exact solution is satisfactory .",
    "the slight difference ( less than 1% in time ) appears only for the last few msec which is not clear in figure  7 .",
    "this is partially due to the error of the integration of the coordinate time ( equation  ( [ eqn : time ] ) ) .",
    "the above result along with the next one clearly shows that the present code can treat the general relativistic gravity correctly .",
    "this and the next section are devoted to demonstrate the performance of this code in the context of the collapse - driven supernovae , that is , it can calculate the hydrodynamics far beyond the dynamical time scale after the proto - neutron star is formed in the central region .",
    "this is the crucial point for the purpose of this paper .    in this section ,",
    "we take a hydrostatic configuration for the initial condition for the dynamical calculation , and see whether this initial state will be maintained or not .",
    "for that purpose , we first solve the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations : @xmath173 where the notation is the same as in the dynamical equations .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath51 is consistent with the dynamical counterpart : @xmath174 the subscript @xmath175 in this equation means the core surface values .",
    "the equation of state is assumed to be polytropic @xmath176 with @xmath177 in the cgs units and @xmath178 .",
    "the central density is taken to be @xmath179g/@xmath152 .",
    "the initial model thus obtained has the gravitational mass of @xmath180m@xmath153 and the radius of @xmath181 km .",
    "this approximate neutron star is nearly the same as that used by schinder et al ( 1988 ) .    in the dynamical simulation ,",
    "we assume the same equation of state and use 100 uniform baryon mass zones . in figures  8 and 9",
    "the trajectories of all the mass zones are shown with the time variation of the courant number .",
    "the time step is controlled so that all the dependent variables should not change more than 2% at each time step .",
    "figure  8 shows the mass element motions for the first 10msec .",
    "as can be seen , nothing occurs except for the very little oscillation during the first 1msec .",
    "the courant number is shown with a curved line across the trajectories .",
    "it is found that the time step is increased monotonically .",
    "this is because the matter velocities decrease monotonically after the first small transient .",
    "figure  9 shows the mass trajectories for the same model but for a much longer time scale .",
    "the final time is 20sec , which should be compared with the dynamical time scale of the neutron star @xmath2msec .",
    "it is also noted this time corresponds to only 300 numerical time steps .",
    "the final courant number exceeds @xmath182 .",
    "these results imply that this dynamical calculation reproduced the hydrostatic configuration correctly and also guarantee that this code treats the general relativity appropriately .      finally shown",
    "are the results of the model calculations of the adiabatic core collapse . in these simulations ,",
    "we assume the simplified equation of state which approximately reproduces the realistic simulations with detailed micro physics and neutrino transfer , and calculate the collapse of the iron core .",
    "the phenomenological equation of state adopted here is what takahara & sato ( 1982 ) used for their parametric research of the dynamics of core collapse .",
    "the total pressure @xmath183 consists of the cold part @xmath184 and the thermal part @xmath185 as follows : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the specific thermal energy density , and the adiabatic index @xmath25 is assumed to be density dependent .",
    "actually @xmath188 for @xmath189g/@xmath152 and @xmath190g/@xmath152 , and @xmath191 for @xmath192g/@xmath152 .",
    "the value of @xmath25 for @xmath193g/@xmath152 is the model parameter .",
    "similarly , the thermal stiffness @xmath194 is varied from model to model . by adjusting these parameters",
    ", we can get both successful explosion models and stalled shock models . in fact , larger values help the shock propagation and tend to strengthen the explosion .",
    "the initial models are woosley s 15m@xmath153 and 35m@xmath153 precollapse models ( @xcite ) . in the former model , the central 1.32m@xmath153 iron core is covered by 100 non - uniform mass zones in which the baryon mass of each cell is increased outward . @xmath195 and @xmath196 are assumed .",
    "this model explodes in a prompt way . in the latter model , on the other hand , the central 2.0m@xmath153 is covered with 150 non - uniform meshes and @xmath197 and @xmath198 are assumed .",
    "the shock is stalled inside the iron core for this model as shown below .",
    "figures  10 and 11 show all the mass trajectories for the 15 m@xmath153 model with the time variation of the courant number . again",
    "i will show the results in two different time scales . in figure  10",
    ", we can see the motions of mass elements until the shock reaches the iron core surface . as stated above ,",
    "since the shock propagates the entire iron core without stagnation and some part of the outer core moves outward at the break out , this model is a successful prompt explosion model .",
    "it is also noted that the central part becomes almost hydrostatic .",
    "the data concerning the location of each mass element and the courant number are saved every 10 time steps . as can be seen , the courant number increases up to about 500 at the break out .",
    "figure  11 shows the subsequent evolution until the calculation is terminated .",
    "the final time is 600msec and corresponds to 5000 numerical time steps .",
    "since the mantle is not taken into consideration , the result after shock breaks out is not of physical significance .",
    "however , the calculation was continued in order to see how large the courant number gets .",
    "as can be seen , the final courant number exceeds 1000 .",
    "one thing to be mentioned here is that the courant number shown here is determined not at the shock wave but at the center of the proto - neutron star , which implies that we could overcome the severe courant limit at the center without instability .",
    "this seems quite encouraging for the purpose of this project .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that this is partly because there is no significant accretion on the proto - neutron star in the successful explosion model .",
    "hence it is of greater importance to see the time evolution of the stalled shock model .    in figure  12",
    "we can see the motions of the representative mass elements for the 35m@xmath153 model until 50msec after the core bounce . in this case",
    ", the shock does not expel the accreting matter , that is , the shock is stalled .",
    "the inner core becomes nearly hydrostatic also in this case .",
    "however , since the matter is still falling onto the proto - neutron star continuously , the courant number can not become so large as the previous model as expected .",
    "the subsequent evolution is shown in figure  13 .",
    "the final time is 900msec after the start of the simulation .",
    "the total number of numerical time steps is 8000 .",
    "as can be seen , in this case the courant number also becomes as large as 1000 .",
    "again this is a very encouraging result for this project .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the resolution of the outer core is not sufficient to resolve the shock wave for the 35m@xmath153 model .",
    "this is not only because the variation of dependent variables is allowed up to 2% in this calculation ( see the results of the relativistic shock tube problems ) , but also because matter continues to concentrate to the center .",
    "hence we must implement some rezoning routine or we should use a larger number of zones .",
    "this is the problem to be solved in the next step .",
    "the implicit general relativistic hydrodynamical scheme is coded using the approximate riemann solver and extensive numerical tests are accomplished .",
    "the scheme is very simple since the formulae to evaluate the velocity and the pressure at the cell interface have such simple forms that we can easily calculate their derivatives with regard to the dependent variables .",
    "the numerical solutions obtained by this scheme show no oscillation after both shock waves and rarefaction waves unlike the schemes requiring an artificial viscosity , although a small erroneous jump appears after the contact surface .",
    "the calculations of the simple adiabatic collapse of massive stellar cores indicate this code is quite stable even if we take a much longer time step than the courant time step , which fact is very encouraging for its application to the more realistic calculation of the late time explosion .",
    "however , it is also found that the time step should be adjusted so that the courant number at the shock wave should be @xmath199 .",
    "it is also probable some automatic rezoning routine should be implemented to resolve the shock wave sufficiently all through the calculation .",
    "the purpose of this project is to provide a tool to study the radiation hydrodynamics of supernova cores far beyond the dynamical time scale of the neutron star .",
    "we are now proceeding to the next step , in which the present hydrodynamic code is combined with a neutrino transfer code using the multi - energy group flux - limited diffusion scheme .",
    "however , the final goal of this project is to make a boltzmann solver and combine it with this implicit hydrodynamical code thereby removing uncertainties regarding the neutrino transfer .    in recent years",
    ", the importance of multi - dimensional effects on the supernova explosion has been pointed out and many detailed numerical simulations have been done . at present , it seems that the clues to the successful supernova explosion are such multi - dimensional effect and neutrinos .",
    "although some effort has been made to do the simulation of multi - dimensional radiation transfer , it seems still far from satisfaction .",
    "hence the one - dimensional simulations with detailed neutrino transfer and multi - dimensional simulations will play complementary roles to one another .",
    "it is also possible that one - dimensional simulation would serve as a guide to make some approximate treatment of the multi - dimensional neutrino transfer .",
    "i am grateful to s. woosley for providing us with the details of his progenitor models .",
    "i also thank h. suzuki for helpful advice and comments and w. hillebrandt , e. mller and e. skillman for their kind review of the manuscript .",
