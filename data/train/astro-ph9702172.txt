    "one of the major concerns in any cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy analysis is to determine if the observed signal is due to real cmb fluctuations or due to some foreground contaminant . at the frequency range and angular scale of the saskatoon experiment ( wollack et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter w97 ; netterfield et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter n97 ) , there are two major potential sources of foreground contamination : diffuse galactic emission and unresolved point sources .",
    "the diffuse galactic contamination includes three components : and free - free radiation , which are important mainly at frequencies below 60  ghz , and thermal emission from dust particles , which is important mainly at frequencies above 60  ghz ( see , e.g. , partridge 1995 ; bennett et al .",
    "1992 , brandt et al .",
    "1994 , bennett et al .",
    "the theoretical point of view , it is possible to distinguish these three components by observing their different frequency dependence and spatial morphology . in practice , however , there is no emission component for which both the frequency dependence and spatial template are currently well known ( see , e.g. , kogut et al .",
    "1996a , hereafter k96a , and references therein ) .",
    "upper limits have been placed on the different contaminants at the frequency range and angular scale of the saskatoon experiment .",
    "for instance , by extrapolating radio maps at 408  mhz ( haslam et al .",
    "1981 ) and 1420  mhz ( reich and reich 1988 ) to 40  ghz , n97 place an upper limit on fluctuations in the emission of 3 within the saskatoon observing region . analysis done on h@xmath3 maps of the saskatoon observing region , gaustad et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and simonetti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) place an upper limit on fluctuations in the diffuse free - free emission of 2  at 40 ghz .",
    "an analysis of the galactic emission in the differential microwave radiometer ( dmr ) map at 53  ghz places limits of ( 3.4@xmath43.7 )  for the emission , ( 7.1@xmath41.7 )   for the free - free , and ( 2.7@xmath41.3 )  for the dust emission , for @xmath530@xmath6 ( kogut et al .",
    "1996b , hereafter k96b ) . extrapolating these dmr results to degree angular scales , tegmark and efstathiou ( 1996 ) obtained an upper limit of 2  for dust emission at 40  ghz .",
    "the purpose of this is to use the saskatoon data ( w97 , n97 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter t97 ) to estimate the galactic emission at degree angular scales . in the following sections , we present the technique used to identify the galactic emission and the results obtained from the cross - correlation of the saskatoon data with different galactic templates .",
    "the saskatoon data set consists of @xmath7=2586 observed data points y@xmath8 ( not including `` ring data '' ) , each containing the true cmb temperature fluctuations in the sky x@xmath9 convolved with some beam function , and with noise n@xmath10 added afterwards .",
    "we assume that the saskatoon data are a superposition of the cmb fluctuations and galactic signals whose angular distributions are traced by an external data set ( k96a ; k96b ) . combining these numbers into vectors",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , we can therefore write _ sk  =   _ cmb  +   +   _ gal , where @xmath14 is the beam function matrix defined in t97 , x@xmath15 are the brightness fluctuations of the galactic template map ( not necessarily in temperature units ) , and @xmath3 is the coefficient that converts the galactic template into antenna temperature . since @xmath160 , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is a constant vector , the data covariance matrix is given by   _ sk _ sk^t - _ sk _ sk^t  =   _ cmb _ cmb^t ^t + ^t , where @xmath19 is the correlation between the data points and themselves , and @xmath20 is the noise covariance matrix .",
    "the former is given by the angular power spectrum @xmath21 through the familiar relation _",
    "cmb^j  =   _ = 0^ p_(_i , j ) c _ , where @xmath22 is the multipole number , @xmath23 are the legendre polynomials , and @xmath24 is the angle between pixels @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    by minimizing @xmath27",
    "we can obtain @xmath28 , the minimum - variance estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath29 , we find that   =   with variance _ ^2   =   .",
    "this variance accounts for the effect of chance alignments between the cmb and the various template maps , since the cmb anisotropy term is included in equation  ( [ corrfunc ] ) .",
    "we compute @xmath30 as described in t97 , with a flat power spectrum @xmath21 = 6@xmath31 normalized to @xmath32=47  .",
    "note that our analysis is performed on the saskatoon scan data @xmath11 , and not on the wiener - filtered saskatoon maps .",
    "the analysis is based on the 1993 - 1995 data from saskatoon experiment ( w97 , n97 , t97 ) .",
    "we treated the ka - band data ( 26 to 36  ghz ) separately from the q - band data ( 36 - 46  ghz ) in order to gain additional frequency information on any correlated emission .",
    "however , it is important to remember that observations made on ka - band constitute less than a quarter of the total data set , and therefore give substantially noisier estimates .",
    "the saskatoon data are insensitive to the monopole ( @xmath22=0 ) , and only marginally sensitive to other low order @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly , when we convolve the template maps with the saskatoon beam function , we are removing the mean of the templates , as well as large angular scale structures . as a consequence ,",
    "our results depend predominantly on the small scale intensity variations in the templates ( @xmath22@xmath3330 ) and are insensitive to the zero levels of the saskatoon data and the template maps .",
    "we cross - correlate the saskatoon data with two different templates : the 408  mhz survey ( haslam et al .",
    "1981 ) and the 1420  mhz survey ( reich and reich 1988 ) . to study dust and free - free emission , we cross - correlate the saskatoon data with three diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) sky maps at wavelengths 240 , 140 and 100  ( boggess et al . 1992 ) . in order to study the extent of point source contamination in the saskatoon data , we cross - correlate with the 1  jy catalog of point sources at 5  ghz ( khr et al .",
    "the templates used in this analysis , as well as the previously described saskatoon data , are shown in figure  [ maps ] .",
    "tables  [ tab : tabcorrka ] and  [ tab : tabcorrq ] show the coefficients @xmath28 and the resulting fluctuations in antenna temperature in the saskatoon ka and q - band data , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the standard deviation of the template map , _ gal^2  =  .",
    "the values of @xmath35 were obtained directly from the template maps after removing monopole and dipole , and smoothing them by a 1@xmath6 gaussian , while @xmath35 for the saskatoon data correspond to the variance at 1@xmath6 , defined as _",
    "sk^2 = _ = 0^ ( ) c _ w_^2 , where @xmath36 is the saskatoon beam function as defined in n97 .",
    "the templates , as well as the point source template , are found to be uncorrelated with the saskatoon data .",
    "all three dirbe far - infrared templates show a correlation , indicating a detection of signal with common spatial structure in the two data sets .",
    "since the three dirbe maps trace the same galactic contamination component , they provide nearly identical estimates of the galactic emission .",
    "the error bars on the correlation between any of the dirbe templates and the saskatoon map are dominated by noise and cmb signal ( random alignments ) in the saskatoon map . for definiteness",
    ", we use the dirbe 100 channel and the correlations obtained for the saskatoon q - band data when placing limits below , since these are the least noisy channels .",
    "k96 detect a positive correlation between the dirbe far - infrared maps and the dmr maps at 31.5 , 53 , and 90  ghz .",
    "the spectral index of the correlation ( rising strongly at long wavelengths ) they identify the source as a superposition of dust and free - free emission . the weaker signal and more restricted frequency coverage",
    "preclude such an unambiguous identification in the saskatoon data set . the spectral index ( of the emission component correlated with dirbe ) between the ka and q - band , @xmath37",
    ", is compatible with an origin from dust emission , free - free emission , or chance alignments .",
    "however , the amplitude of the signal is much larger than expected for dust emission , leaving free - free emission and chance alignments as the alternatives .",
    "as mentioned , our calculation of @xmath38 includes the effect of chance alignments between the cmb and the various template maps . assuming that the hypothesis of k96 can be extended to saskatoon scales",
    ", we argue that the correlation between the dirbe template and the saskatoon data is most likely due to free - free contamination .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : tabcorrq ] , the probability that such a strong correlation is caused by chance alignments is a few percent .",
    "we tested the cross - correlation technique by analyzing 1000 constrained realizations of cmb and saskatoon instrument noise .",
    "we recovered unbiased estimates @xmath28 with a variance in excellent agreement with equation ( [ varalpha ] ) .",
    "as an additional test , we generated simulated dirbe patches by replacing our dirbe region with an equivalent patch selected from somewhere else in the sky .",
    "since the signal in the dirbe map depends strongly on latitude , we restricted the patches to lie in the latitude range 20@xmath6 @xmath39 34@xmath6 , corresponding to the latitude range of the saskatoon observing region . in figure  [ histograms ] , we plot the cumulative distribution for the correlation @xmath40 between saskatoon q - band data and the 288 selected patches of the dirbe 100 map , where @xmath41 is the standard deviation of the patch actually observed by saskatoon .",
    "this distribution is seen to agree well with a gaussian distribution with variance given by equation ( [ varalpha ] ) , even though the statistical properties of the dirbe patches themselves are , of course , not gaussian .",
    "specifically , 284 of the 288 patches ( or 98.6% of them ) are less correlated with the the saskatoon q - band data than the correct dirbe patch , in good agreement with the significance level of 97% computed using a gaussian distribution .",
    "the same tests were carried out for the dirbe 240 and 140 maps and for the saskatoon ka - band data , giving similar results .    due to the proximity of the saskatoon observing region to the galactic plane",
    ", one might conjecture that the bulk of the saskatoon - dirbe correlation is not due to a small scale physical association of dust and free - free emission , but is caused by large scale gradients common to all three diffuse galactic foreground components ( including ) .",
    "however , the data do not support this hypothesis : we cross - correlated the dirbe 100 and haslam maps of the saskatoon observing region and found no significant correlation .    in summary ,",
    "the saskatoon - dirbe correlation at 30 and 40 ghz is compatible with the free - free emission detected by dmr at 31.5 ghz , assuming an @xmath42 power spectrum for diffuse free - free emission .",
    "the saskatoon value is slightly larger than upper limits from direct h@xmath3 images , although the uncertainties are substantial .",
    "we note that the inferred h@xmath3 limits assume an electron temperature @xmath43 k ; a lower electron temperature would produce a larger microwave signal for fixed h@xmath3 intensity .",
    "a compilation of free - free limits and detections on various angular scales is given in table  [ tab : tabff ] .",
    "the cross - correlation technique introduced by k96a and k96b provides a powerful way of measuring the level of galactic foreground contamination .",
    "the templates , as well as the point source template , are uncorrelated with the saskatoon data .",
    "we find a cross - correlation ( at 97% confidence ) between the saskatoon q - band data and the dirbe 100 map .",
    "the amplitude of the contamination correlated with dirbe 100 is @xmath44 17 at 40 ghz .",
    "we argue that the hypothesis of free - free contamination at degree angular scales is the most likely explanation for this correlated emission .",
    "accordingly , the spatial correlation between dust and warm ionized gas observed on large angular scales seems to persist down to the smaller angular scales .    as reported by n97 ,",
    "the angular power spectrum from the saskatoon data is @xmath45=49@xmath46 at @xmath47=87 ( corresponding to fluctuations around 90 on degree scales ) , which is a much higher signal than any of the contributions from the foreground contaminants discussed above , confirming that the saskatoon data is not seriously contaminated by foreground sources . since the foreground and",
    "the cmb signals approximately add in quadrature , a foreground signal with 20% of the cmb causes the cmb fluctuations to be over - estimated by @xmath48 .    in the course of this analysis , we became aware that erik leitch and collaborators have found a correlation between iras 100 map and owens valley data ; these results are forthcoming .",
