    "an excess was recently observed in the invariant mass of di - photon events during run 2 of the lhc with a local significance around 3.6@xmath9 by atlas  @xcite using 3.2 fb@xmath10 data and around 2.6@xmath9 by cms  @xcite using 2.6 fb@xmath10 data .",
    "the excess has no obvious characteristic shape . as a consequence",
    ", innumerable publications have appeared in the literature attempting to explain it as either an @xmath11-channel breit - wigner ( bw ) resonance ( typically a ( pseudo)scalar higgs one , henceforth denoted as higgs@xmath12 ) decaying into @xmath13 @xcite , or as an end - point jacobian shoulder ( typically induced by a cascade decay of a heavy object producing two photons alongside some amount of missing energy ) @xcite , or as a resonant qcd bound state @xcite , or as a threshold effect in loops @xcite , or , indeed , as a combination of some of these phenomena @xcite .    however , two aspects that will strike the reader of most such papers are the following ones . on the one hand , a common ingredient to these is the presence of new states entering the loops onsetting the @xmath14 process , the one underpinning most of the above explanations . on the other hand , by maintaining perturbativity of the couplings of the hypothesised new states entering the loops with the 750 gev resonance(s ) , it is generally impossible to obtain the required @xmath15 cross sections recorded by atlas and cms if one assumes their nature being the same as that of standard model ( sm ) quarks , leptons and/or gauge bosons . what is generally required in order to have predictions comparable to experimental event rates , in fact , is one or more additional coloured fermion(s ) , which would couple directly to gluons and thus have a colour charge , as opposed to coloured scalars ( e.g. , squarks in supersymmetry ) , as the latter have fewer ( spin ) degrees of freedom compared to the former .",
    "let us concentrate here on spin 1/2 coloured fermions and neglect higher spin representations , as these do not exist in nature ( in elementary form ) . remarkably then , following the discovery of the 125 gev higgs boson @xcite with essentially a sm nature",
    ", the existence of any additional chiral quark ( i.e. , with sm - like @xmath16 structure in gauge boson charged currents ) has been excluded @xcite .",
    "hence , some non - chiral coloured spin 1/2 object is required , ideally coupling to the higgs(750 ) state(s ) with significant strength .",
    "vector - like quarks ( vlqs ) seem to be ideal candidates to satisfy such requirements .",
    "these presumed new states of matter are heavy spin 1/2 particles that transform as triplets under colour but , unlike sm quarks , their left- and right - handed couplings have the same electro - weak ( ew ) quantum numbers .",
    "further , their couplings to higgs bosons do not participate in the standard ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) dynamics onset by the higgs mechanism , hence they are not of yukawa type ( i.e. , proportional to the mass ) , rather they are additional parameters , which can then be set as large as needed in order to achieve the required cross section to explain the aforementioned 750 gev excess , albeit still in the perturbative regime and such that mixing with ordinary quarks is possible ( which enables vlqs to couple to higgs states ) .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have carried out a broad programme of searches for vlqs with different quantum numbers , probing single and pair production mechanisms , as well as decay modes into all three generations of sm quarks ( for the most updated experimental results of atlas and cms we refer to the respective web pages @xcite ) .",
    "however , new extra quarks can be charged under new symmetries , like t - parity in little higgs @xcite and kaluza - klein parity in extra dimension @xcite models , thus forbidding the decay to sm particles but allowing decays to dark matter ( dm ) candidates instead .",
    "such vlqs have been searched for at both the tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite , but the constraints on their mass and decays depend on the mass of the dm candidate and on which sm quarks they decay to .",
    "specifically , if the vlq and the dm candidate have a strong mass degeneracy , the visible decay products of the vlq are too soft to be detected and , as a consequence , the bounds on the vlq masses can be very weak , analogously to the case of strong degeneracy between squarks and neutralinos in supersymmetry .",
    "intriguingly , as we shall detail below , even in our simple scenario , vlq mass values of 375 gev are still possible , so that they could enhance the @xmath17 rate also through the loop threshold effects advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite at @xmath18 .    conversely , let us also assume that this additional 750 gev ( pseudo)scalar object(s ) possibly behind the experimental data do(es ) originate from the same ewsb mechanism governing the generation of the 125 gev higgs state .",
    "this is indeed a possibility not excluded by current theoretical and experimental constraints . under these circumstances",
    ", it is then of phenomenological importance to consider the case of a second higgs doublet participating in ewsb alongside the one responsible for the discovered higgs state .",
    "this mass generation dynamics is well known in the form of 2-higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) @xcite .",
    "we are therefore left with a new physics construct that would include a 2hdm supplemented by one or more vlqs as a potential scenario explaining the run 2 di - photon data .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to build on the results of @xcite , where a similar possibility was discussed ( by some of us ) , in which the role of a 2hdm was played by that of a sm higgs doublet and an additional higgs singlet .",
    "we intend to review here a 2hdm plus single vlq scenario , where the vlq has the same em charges of the top quark ( with which it then mixes ) , as a candidate to explain the 750 gev data .",
    "our paper is formatted as follows .",
    "in the next section , we describe in some detail the model concerned . in the three following ones we present our results .",
    "we then conclude .",
    "a simple extention of the sm is the well known 2hdm that extends the higgs sector of the sm by an additional higgs doublet .",
    "the spectrum of the model contains additional higgses and has an alignment limit @xcite , in which one of the higgses completely mimics the sm one .",
    "+ to describe our model , we start with the well known cp - conserving 2hdm scalar potential for ( @xmath19 with a discrete symmetry @xmath20 that is only violated softly by dimension two terms @xcite : @xmath21 , \\label{thdmv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all parameters in the above potential are real . the two complex scalar doublets may be rotated into a basis where only one obtains a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the would - be goldstone bosons and @xmath25 are a pair of charged higgses .",
    "herein , @xmath3 is a cp - odd pseudoscalar which does not mix with the other neutral states in the cp - conserving limit .",
    "the physical cp - even scalars @xmath26 and @xmath2 are mixtures of @xmath27 and the scalar mixing is parameterised as and @xmath28 . ]",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle used to rotate @xmath31 into @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the additional mixing needed to diagonalise the cp - even mass matrix . as mentioned in the introduction , in order to increase the gluon - gluon - higgs and/or photon - photon - higgs couplings , one can advocate the inclusion of new heavy fermions such as a vlq partner of the top quark with the same em charge .",
    "in fact , there are many sm extensions that require vector - like fermions in their spectrum ( for an overview see @xcite ) .",
    "such a new vlq will mix with the top quark through the yukawa interactions and can contribute , therefore , to some sm observables . to derive these new interactions , we first study the yukawa sector within a 2hdm extended by a vlq pair @xmath34 in the @xmath35 representation of the sm ew group . in the type ii 2hdm , our concern here , one doublet couples to up quarks and the other couples to down quarks and charged leptons . the most general renormalisable model for the quark yukawa interactions and mass terms can be described , limited to third generation quarks and new vlqs , by the following lagrangian , @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 are the sm quark doublets and @xmath40 are the sm up - type quark singlets . note that additional kinetic mixing terms of the form @xmath41 can always be rotated away and reabsorbed into the definition of @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , one can , without loss of generality , choose a weak interaction basis where @xmath43 is diagonal and real . in the weak eigenstate basis @xmath44 , the top quark and vlq mass matrix is @xmath45 where @xmath43 and @xmath46 are the yukawa couplings for the top quark and vlq , respectively , @xmath47 gev is the vev of the sm higgs doublet while @xmath48 is a bare mass term of the vlq , which , as intimated , is unrelated to the higgs mechanism of ewsb .",
    "it is clear from the above mass matrix that the physical mass of the heavy top , @xmath49 , is different from @xmath48 due to the @xmath50 mixing .",
    "furthermore , such a mass matrix can be diagonalised by a bi - unitary transformation such that @xmath51 with @xmath52 the matrix given in eq .",

    "if we neglect the small mixing of vlqs with the first two quark generations , the yukawa interactions can be described by four independent physical parameters : two quark masses ( @xmath73 ) , a yukawa term ( @xmath74 ) and a mixing angle ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "as intimated in the introduction , atlas and cms have performed direct searches for vlqs at 7,8 tev , having potential sensitivities up to 800 gev or so @xcite . we have already explained that several vlq scenarios may be conceived in order to enable @xmath76 values down to 350 gev or so yet still compatible with data . clearly , the decay patterns of new vlqs depend on the representation of these fermionic states . in our rather simple scenario ,",
    "i.e. , in the case of a singlet vlq , if we neglect the first and second generation mixing , the heavy top @xmath8 will decay into the following final states : @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath26 is the sm - like higgs state ( recall that we intend to select @xmath79 gev ) . under these assumptions ,",

    "@xcite is the most constraining one and excludes a heavy @xmath8 quark with mass lower than 640 gev at the 95% cl .",
    "this lower limit can , however , be weakened down to 300 gev if @xmath8 couples to first and second generation quarks as well @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a possible model construction in our case , which , however , we do not pursue in any detail as such additional interactions would not enter the higgs boson observables we intend to study .",
    "we are nonetheless entitled to scan on @xmath49 starting from such low @xmath76 values .",
    "in fact , note that , in our 2hdm+vlq construct , when @xmath80 exceeds 800 gev , then also the @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 decays open up , alongside @xmath84 .",
    "however , we do not expect that current run 2 data have sensitivities to such scenarios , which may eventually become testable as the luminosity increases , up to vlq masses of order 1.5 tev or so , as demonstrated in a similar study assuming chiral quarks within a 2hdm @xcite .",
    "in fact , do recall that @xmath8 production at the lhc is substantial , in both the qcd induced pair production channel ( dominant at low @xmath49 ) and the ew mediated single production channel ( dominant at high @xmath49 ) .    in summary",
