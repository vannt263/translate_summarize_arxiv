    "we discuss here the thermal evolution of the hadronic parameters of @xmath8 in the vector channel , using thermal qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the original article @xcite for details .",
    "this technique has been used previously in the light - light and in the heavy - light quark sector @xcite- @xcite , with the following emerging picture : ( i ) for increasing temperature , hadronically stable particles develop a non - zero width , and resonances become broader , diverging at a critical temperature interpreted as the deconfinement temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the thermal resonance broadening was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "ii ) above the resonance region , the continuum threshold in hadronic spectral functions , i.e. the onset of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , decreases monotonically with increasing temperature . when @xmath10 hadrons disappear from the spectrum .",
    "( iii ) this scenario is also supported by the behavior of hadronic couplings , or leptonic decay constants , which approach zero as @xmath10 .",
    "masses , on the other hand , do not to provide information about deconfinement .    the thermal behavior of the heavy - heavy quark correlator should be different from that involving at least one light quark since : a ) in the light - light and heavy - light quark sector , the pqcd contribution is dominated by the time - like spectral function ( annihilation term ) , which is relatively unimportant in relation to the light quark condensate contribution , being the scattering pqcd spectral function highly suppressed . instead , for heavy - heavy quark systems this term becomes increasingly important with increasing temperature while the annihilation term only contributes near threshold ; b ) the non - perturbative qcd sector in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of light - light and heavy - light quark correlators is driven by the light quark condensate , responsible for the behavior of the continuum threshold since @xmath11 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the light quark condensate is the order parameter for chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "in contrast , for heavy - heavy quark correlators the leading power correction in the ope is that of the gluon condensate , which has a very different thermal behavior . in this approach ,",
    "the critical temperature for deconfinement is a phenomenological parameter which does not need to coincide with e.g. the critical temperature obtained in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "in fact , results from qcd sum rules lead to values of @xmath9 somewhat lower than those from lattice qcd . in order to compare with other approaches , we express our results in terms of the ratio @xmath12 .",
    "we find for charmonium in the vector channel that the continuum threshold , @xmath13 , decreases with increasing @xmath14 , being driven by the gluon condensate and the pqcd spectral function in the space - like region , until it reaches the pqcd threshold @xmath3 at @xmath15 ( @xmath5 is the charm quark mass ) .",
    "below this value of @xmath2 the sum rules cease to be valid .",
    "the @xmath8 mass remains basically constant as in the light - light or heavy - light systems .",
    "we have , however , a very different thermal evolution of the width and the coupling . both are almost independent of @xmath14 up to @xmath16 where the width begins to increase substantially , but then above @xmath17 it starts to decrease sharply , and the coupling increases also sharply .",
    "this suggests the survival of the @xmath8 resonance above the deconfinement temperature .    the pqcd spectral function in the space - like region plays here a very important role .",
    "non - relativistic approaches to charmonium at finite temperature would normally miss this contribution .",
    "in fact , the complex energy plane in the non - relativistic case would only have one cut along the positive real axis , which would correspond to the time - like ( annihilation ) region of pqcd .",
    "the space - like contribution ( @xmath18 ) in the form of a cut in the energy plane centered at the origin for @xmath19 , would not be present in the non - relativistic case .",
    "we consider the correlator of the heavy - heavy quark vector current at finite temperature @xmath20| > >   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the heavy ( charm ) quark field .",
    "the matrix element above is understood to be the gibbs average in the quark - gluon basis .",
    "the imaginary part of the vector correlator in pqcd at finite temperature involves two pieces , one in the time - like region ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 , which survives at t=0 , and one in the space - like region ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 , which vanishes at t=0 . to",
    "leading order in pqcd we find    @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 , @xmath5 is the heavy quark mass , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the fermi thermal function . in the rest frame of the thermal bath , @xmath31 , the above result reduces to @xmath32 \\nonumber\\\\\\times\\;\\theta(\\omega - 2 m_q ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quark mass is assumed independent of @xmath14 , a good approximation for @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "only the leading order in the strong coupling will be considered here .",
    "the pqcd piece in the space - like region demands a careful analysis . in the complex energy plane , and in the space - like region ,",
    "the correlator @xmath34 , eq.(1 ) , has a cut centered at the origin and extending between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the rest frame this cut",
    "produces a delta function @xmath37 in the imaginary part of @xmath34 .",
    "the result is @xmath38 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the corresponding hadronic representation is parametrized in terms of the ground state resonance , the @xmath0/@xmath1 , followed by a continuum given by pqcd after a threshold @xmath39 . in the zero width approximation ,",
    "the hadronic spectral function is @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the leptonic decay constant is defined as @xmath42    when considering a finite ( total ) width the following replacement will be understood @xmath43    the hadronic scattering term , due to current scattering off d - mesons , is negligible @xcite .",
    "the correlation function @xmath44 , eq.(1 ) , satisfies a once subtracted dispersion relation . to eliminate the subtraction one can use hilbert moments , i.e.    @xmath45",
    "where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is an external four - momentum squared , to be considered as a free parameter . using cauchy s theorem in the complex s - plane ,",
    "the hilbert moments become finite energy qcd sum rules ( fesr ) , i.e. @xmath48 where @xmath49    @xmath50    and @xmath51 is given by the first term in eq.(5 ) modified in finite - width according to eq.(6 ) , and the pqcd spectral functions are given by eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "+ the dimension d=4 non perturbative term in the ope is well known in the literature , see @xcite for details .",
    "the dependence on n is quite cumbersome and it is proportional to the gluon condensate @xmath52 . at low temperatures , this condensate    has been calculated in chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in this framework",
    "the condensate remains essentially constant up @xmath53 , after which it decreases sharply . in order to go beyond the low temperature regime of chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "lattice qcd provides the right tool . a good approximation @xcite is given by the expression @xmath54\\ ] ] where @xmath55 mev is the breakpoint temperature where the condensate begins to decrease appreciably , and @xmath56 mev is the temperature at which @xmath57 .",
    "+ returning to the @xmath58 dependence of the hilbert moments , eq.(7 ) , we shall fix @xmath58 and @xmath59 from the experimental values of the mass , the coupling , and the width at t=0 . at finite temperature",
    "there are non - diagonal ( lorentz non - invariant ) condensates that might contribute to the ope .",
    "non - gluonic operators are highly suppressed @xcite , @xcite so that they can be safely ignored .",
    "we have considered also a gluonic twist - two term in the ope introduced in @xcite , and computed on the lattice in @xcite .",
    "its impact is small,(2 - 6)% , and plays no appreciable role in the results .",
    "we begin by determining @xmath2 and @xmath58 at t=0 from the moments , eq.(8 ) , and using as input the experimental values @xcite @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , as well as @xmath63 , and @xcite @xmath64 . in the zero - width approximation one",
    "finds from eq.(9 ) that @xmath65    given the extremely small total width of the @xmath8 it turns out that the above relation also holds with extreme accuracy in finite width . using eq.(8 )",
    "this leads to @xmath66 which depends only on the two unknowns @xmath2 and @xmath58 , and provides the first equation to determine this pair of parameters .",
    "the second equation can be e.g. eq.(8 ) with @xmath67 . in this way we find that @xmath68 , and @xmath69 reproduce the experimental values of the mass , coupling , and width of @xmath8 within less than 1% .",
    "this whole set of hadronic parameters will then be used to normalize the corresponding parameters at finite temperature . in this way , see @xcite for details , we were able to find the thermal evolution of @xmath2 , the @xmath8 mass , its width and its coupling .",
    "we show here only the behavior of the width and the coupling ( figs . 1 and 2 ) since these are the most important results of this analysis .",
    "both the width and the coupling can only be determined up to @xmath70 beyond which @xmath71 and the fesr integrals have no longer a support .",
    "the temperature behavior of the width and the coupling shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 strongly suggests the survival of the @xmath8 above the critical temperature for deconfinement .",
    "this conclusion agrees with results from lattice qcd @xcite , but disagrees with non - relativistic determinations . as pointed out earlier",
    ", the reason for this disagreement might very well be the absence of the central cut ( qcd scattering term ) in the energy plane in non - relativistic frameworks .",
