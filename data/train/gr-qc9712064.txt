    "various particle physics models suggest that bosons might play an important role in the evolution of the universe .",
    "these models predict the abundant production of these bosonic particles in the early universe and their presence in large numbers even today .",
    "although the bosonic particles have never actually been directly detected they are considered as leading candidates of dark matter[1 ] .",
    "these bosons could by a jeans instability mechanism[2 ] condense into compact gravitating objects like boson stars .",
    "boson stars are made up of self - gravitating complex scalar fields with or without further self coupling[3,4 ] .",
    "the equilibrium configurations represent an exact balance between the attractive effect of gravity and the natural tendency for the scalar field to disperse .",
    "the stability of such an object is hence a central issue .",
    "it is well known that equilibrium configurations of boson stars have stable ( @xmath0 ) and unstable ( @xmath1 ) branches as well as a hierarchy of ground and excited states[3][13 ] . in the first paper in this series[5 ] , the dynamical evolution under various perturbations of ground state boson stars made up of non self - interacting scalar fields was studied .    in the absence of self coupling the mass profile of the ground state configurations , when plotted against the central density @xmath2 ,",
    "has a peak at @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 refers to the planck mass ) corresponding to a mass of about @xmath5 kg at @xmath6 ( for bosons of mass @xmath7gev ) .",
    "configurations for which @xmath8 ( the @xmath0 branch ) are stable to perturbations [ 5,12 ] while those with @xmath9 ( the @xmath1 branch ) are unstable .",
    "stability here refers to the ability of a @xmath8 star to settle to a new configuration in the same branch under perturbations .",
    "a @xmath10 configuration star is unstable in that , upon perturbations , it can not stay on the same branch . if it can not lose enough mass and settle to a stable state it either collapses to a black hole or",
    "disperses to infinity .",
    "stable boson stars have very specific quasinormal modes of oscillation under perturbations , a feature important for the detection and identification of these stars .    in the present paper",
    "the study of paper i[5 ] is extended to the excited state boson star , and to the case of a @xmath11 self - interacting scalar field .",
    "the dynamical evolutions of such systems are studied numerically .",
    "the action for the system studied in this paper is given by @xmath12.\\ ] ] there are two reasons to include the self - coupling interaction[6,8 ] .",
    "firstly without the @xmath11 term , the maximum mass of a boson star , @xmath13 ( where @xmath4 refers to the planck mass and @xmath14 the mass of the boson ) could be too small to be astrophysically significant .",
    "for example , for @xmath151gev , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the solar mass . on the other hand , for interacting fields ,",
    "even with a small coupling , the mass of the star can be large[6 ] . in this case",
    "@xmath18 which is larger than ( 1.2 ) by a factor of @xmath19 , for @xmath7gev .",
    "a moderate value of @xmath20 then leads to @xmath21 , which is particularly interesting due to the gravitational microlensing data[14 ] .",
    "secondly boson stars give us a way to study local anisotropy and its effects .",
    "the larger the self coupling parameter @xmath22 the smaller the fractional anisotropy .",
    "changing the self coupling parameter for a given central density provides a way to vary this anisotropy in a natural way[8 ] . by anisotropy",
    "we mean that the radial and tangential components of the pressure are different .",
    "this is of interest because deviations from perfect fluid assumptions for even nuclear matter is expected in the presence of strong gravitational fields . in boson",
    "stars this anisotropy appears very naturally .",
    "although we have not studied specifically the anisotropies in this paper , it provides motivation for adding a self - coupling term .",
    "the results of paper i are also extended by considering the evolution of excited states with and without self coupling .",
    "this is of importance because if boson stars exist and are detected , they are most likely those interacting with their environment and going through some excitation process .",
    "excited configurations might also be intermediate stages during the formation process of these stars .",
    "in this study the configurations considered are spherically symmetric ; all perturbations of equilibrium configurations are purely radial .",
    "full 3d simulations are underway and will be reported in a future paper .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows :    section ii sets up the mathematical foundations of the problem , including the equilibrium and evolution equations .",
    "the calculation of the initial data sets are discussed and the techniques used to evolve the system numerically are briefly outlined .",
    "section iii details the evolution of ground state configurations with self coupling .",
    "we show that they have similar @xmath0 and @xmath1 branch structures as boson stars without self - coupling .",
    "@xmath0 branch stars are stable with regard to perturbations . by this",
    "we mean that under small perturbations they return to configurations on the same branch although not to the same configurations .",
    "we studied in detail the fundamental quasinormal modes of oscillation of @xmath0-branch stars ( those for which @xmath8 ) .",
    "they are important characteristics for observations .",
    "they can also be used to predict the end point of evolution of perturbed stars , as well as a comparison between modes for different self couplings . in the next subsection of section iii , the migration of a @xmath1-branch star ( that for which @xmath23 to the @xmath0-branch is described .",
    "the essential features of the @xmath24 case are retained .",
    "if a @xmath1-branch star is perturbed by the addition of mass , the star will collapse to a black hole .",
    "when , as a result of perturbation , the star s mass is reduced , corresponding to annihilation of scalar particles , the star expands and moves to the @xmath0-branch , oscillates , and settles to a new equilibrium configuration of lower mass .",
    "section iv studies various aspects of the evolution of excited states .",
    "excited states have similar band structures to ground state stars . in this paper",
    ", we study generic perturbations that may exist for a boson star in an astrophysical environment , e.g. , some additional scalar particles falling in .",
    "the s - branch excited states have previously been found to be stable under infinitesimal perturbations that conserve the total mass and particle number of the boson star[4 ] .",
    "we find that these stars are inherently unstable irrespective of whether they lie on the @xmath0 or the @xmath1 branch but the time scales of instability are different .",
    "this result is consistent with the study of infinitesimal perturbations[12 ] . if they can not lose enough mass to transit to the ground state they either collapse to black holes or , as in the case of stars for which @xmath25 ( @xmath26 mass of the star , @xmath27 number of bosons and @xmath15 mass of one boson ) disperse to infinity .",
    "the decay of some higher excited configurations are also studied .",
    "these higher node configurations cascade through intermediate configurations of lower excited states on their way to collapse .",
    "this is reminiscent of atomic transitions where atoms go from an excited state to lower states through intermediate ones , lending credence to the idea that boson stars are like gravitational atoms[3 ] .",
    "a brief conclusion follows in section v. an appendix at the end shows some features of the the high @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) configurations , including a calculation of quasinormal modes .",
    "in this section the mathematical formulation of the problem , the creation of the equilibrium and perturbed boson star modes and the numerical code used to study them are described .",
    "the formulation is the same as that of paper i in this series[5 ] except for the self - interaction term .",
    "the numerical treatment used in this code has various improvements over that described in paper i. some details of the numerical code , e.g. , convergence tests etc , which are similar to those reported in paper i will not be repeated here .",

    "the maximum mass increases with @xmath28 but the profile is similar .",
    "the expectation that the branch to the left of the maximum is stable ( @xmath0-branch ) while that to the right ( @xmath1-branch ) is unstable , as in the case of ground state configurations without self coupling , is found to be true .",

    "the point where this function is a maximum corresponds to the core of the star contracting to its minimum size in a cycle .",
    "similarly , the maximum radial metric starts to decrease as the star expands . at each expansion",
    "the star loses mass through scalar radiation .",
    "the oscillations damp out in time as the star starts settling to the new configuration . a plot of mass vs. time is shown in fig .",

    "a characteristic of the boson star that could be important for its observation and identification is its fundamental oscillation frequency which can be determined from fig .",
    "we found @xmath99 .",
    "the oscillation frequencies for a large number of s - branch stars have been compiled in this way .",
    "4a shows a plot of the oscillation frequency versus mass for many slightly perturbed configurations ( masses within 0.1% of the unperturbed mass . ) as the mass increases , the frequency increases and then drops down as the transition point ( @xmath100 ) is approached , signaling the onset of instability .",
    "this is seen for both the non - self interacting as well as the self - interacting case .",
    "these quasinormal modes of oscillation characterize @xmath0-branch stars .",

    "we have seen this trend even for @xmath28 values as high as @xmath102 ( see discussion on high @xmath28 stars in the appendix ) .",

    "( this can be understood as a size effect : on the @xmath0-branch , higher mass stars are smaller and have higher frequencies . )",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "the maximum oscillation frequencies of @xmath103 and @xmath104 configurations are higher than that of the @xmath90 case .",
    "as the stars get much larger , though , the highest frequency starts to decrease .",
    "for example the maximum frequency for @xmath105 stars being less than that of @xmath106 stars which is in itself lower than that of the @xmath104 case . a perturbation calculation for the high @xmath28 case",
    "is shown in the appendix to show the dependence of quasinormal mode frequencies on @xmath28 for high @xmath28 configurations .",
    "the frequency is proportional to the inverse of the square root of @xmath28 .",
    "thus as the stars get really big they oscillate less and less rapidly and numerically it is no longer feasible to evolve them .",
    "( the time step used in the numerical simulation can not be increased as it is determined by the intrinsic oscillation time scale of the scalar field , which is many orders of magniture shorter than the oscillation time scale of the whole star for these cases . )",
    "the quasinormal mode curves are also useful in determining evolutions of strongly perturbed @xmath0-branch stars and the final configurations they could settle into .",
    "a perturbed star loses mass and settles to a final configuration corresponding to a position on the solid line in the figure . in fig .",
    "4b we single out the @xmath104 curve and plot the evolution of the @xmath0-branch star discussed above .",
    "the points @xmath107 show the route to a new configuration .",
    "these points correspond to times @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "by extrapolating this line to where it meets the @xmath104 curve one could expect a final mass of about @xmath110 .",
    "for the case of non - self interacting fields it was shown in ref .  [ 5 ] that accretion of scalar fields causes @xmath1-branch stars to collapse to black holes .",
    "however , lowering the density can make the star migrate to the @xmath0-branch .",
    "these features are also seen in the presence of self coupling .",

    "the star initially expands rapidly as it moves to the @xmath0-branch .",
    "this can be seen from the sharp drop in the radial metric .",
    "once it moves to the stable branch , it oscillates about the new configuration that it is going to settle to .",
    "5c shows the mass of the star as a function of time .",
    "it loses mass at each expansion losing less and less mass at each subsequent expansion and the curve gets smoother and smoother as it prepares to settle to its final state .",
    "fig .  6 , which shows the oscillation frequency as a function of mass for @xmath105 , can be used to predict the end point of migration .",
    "points @xmath112 and @xmath113 show the migration of this star .",
    "these correspond to times of 500 , 1000 , 2000 and 3500 .",
    "the oscillation is clearly damping out .",
    "the final configuration it is expected to settle down to is shown as a dot and corresponds to a stable star of central density @xmath114 with a mass of @xmath115 .",

    "the mass versus central density curve has a second , gentler peak , similar to the white dwarf neutron star situation .",
    "one might suspect that this corresponds to another stable and unstable branch respectively .",
    "however we find that configurations on both sides of the peak are unstable .",
    "these configurations always disperse upon perturbation , consistent with the fact that they have @xmath116 , where @xmath117 was the mass of the star and @xmath118 was the number of bosons multiplied by the mass of a boson .    in summary ground state configurations of boson stars with self coupling have stable ( @xmath0 ) and unstable ( @xmath1 ) branches just like boson stars without self coupling .",
    "the stable configurations have very specific quasinormal modes of oscillation .",

    "excited states of boson stars have field configurations characterized by nodes .",
    "the first excited state has one node , the second has two and so on . studying their stability and",

    "the mass profiles of excited state boson stars are similar to ground state stars .",
    "7 shows the mass versus central density curves for ground , first and second excited states of boson stars without self coupling .",
    "the maximum mass increases with the number of nodes as expected .",
    "the similarity of mass profiles of excited boson stars to their ground state counterparts , might lead one to expect stable and unstable configurations to the left and right of the maximum mass respectively in analogy with ground state configurations .",
    "however , our numerical studies show that the excited boson star configurations on both sides of the peak are inherently unstable except that the time scales for instability are different .",
    "if they can not lose enough mass to go to the ground state they become black holes or totally disperse .",
    "this occurs even if no explicit perturbations are put in the numerical evolution other than those introduced by the finite differencing error in the numerical integration .",
    "we have also carried out perturbations that correspond to more scalar particles falling on to the star , or those that decrease the scalar field strength at the center point corresponding to scalar particles decaying through some channels[5 ] .",
    "the instability shows up in all cases studied .",
    "we note that this instability is @xmath121 in contradiction with the result of[4 ] , which concluded that @xmath0 branch excited states are stable under infinitesimal perturbations that strictly conserve @xmath117 and @xmath72 , ( where @xmath117 is the mass of the star , @xmath72 the number of bosons and @xmath14 the boson mass . )",
    "our result of instability under generic perturbation is consistent with the studies of @xmath90 stars under infinitesimal perturbation[12 ] .",
    "the presence of a self coupling term increases the time scale of instability but the essential pattern remains the same . in the following",
    "we will first give a detailed account of the dynamical evolution and carry out a study of the instability time scales .",
    "excited state stars with masses less than the maximum mass of a _ ground _ state configuration always form ground state stable configurations .",

    "next we turn to a study of instability time scales . in simulations where a black hole will form , the imminent development of an apparent horizon leads to a rapid collapse of the lapse due to the polar slicing used in the evolution .",
    "we take the time of collapse of the lapse at the origin to @xmath145 of its initial central value to be the approximate time for formation of the black hole .",
    "9b shows this time scale for a 1-node star without self coupling .",
    "we plot the decay time scales of first excited state stars as a function of central field density . again",
    "no explicit perturbation is applied in these evolutions other than the discretization error in the simulation . in order to make a fair comparison of the time scale due to such a perturbation we cover the radius of the star in all cases by the same number of grid points .",
    "the maximum ground state mass for stars without self coupling is around .633@xmath146 .",
    "this corresponds to a central density of @xmath147 for a 1-node star .",
    "we described earlier that stars with central densities below @xmath148 ( mass of @xmath149 ) lose enough mass and move to the ground state . beyond that and upto the @xmath136 point they collapse to black holes , while stars with @xmath150 corresponding to a central field density of @xmath151 disperse to infinity .",
    "the time by which collapse takes place to a black hole decreases with increasing central density along the @xmath0 branch .",
    "this trend continues for a while into the @xmath1 branch ( starting at @xmath152 until @xmath153 ) but as one approaches the @xmath136 point the stars lose a significant amount of matter to infinity before they collapse to black holes and evolve on a longer time scale .",
    "for example a star of central density @xmath154 has an initial radius of @xmath155 .",
    "( the radius of the star is defined as the radius which contains @xmath156 of the mass of the star . )",
    "its radius increases to as much as 115 , more than an order of magnitude , before it starts collapsing .",
    "dispersion time scales of a couple of stars for @xmath157 which disperse to infinity ( instead of collapsing to a black hole ) are also shown on the figure . to give a sense of the instability time scales of these configurations",
    "we take the time scale to be the time by which these stars disperse to ten times their original radii .",
    "this time drops drastically for stars with @xmath158 .",
    "next we turn to the case of @xmath159 .",
    "10a shows black hole formation for a @xmath105 star in the first excited state , with a central density @xmath160 .",
    "this star had an initial radius of about 20.7 where the radius is again defined as that containing @xmath156 of the mass .",
    "the lapse finally collapses to zero indicating that an apparent horizon is about to form .",
    "the time scale of collapse to the black hole was around 1985 compared to a time scale of less than 800 for a @xmath161 star of similar radius without self coupling which is shown in fig .",
    "this is to be expected as the @xmath28 term represents a repulsive force .",
    "the time is again determined by the lapse collapsing to @xmath162 of its original value at @xmath55 .",
    "we now turn to the evolution of a highly excited state . in fig .",
    "11a we show the initial field configuration of a star containing 5 nodes . for a five node star",
    "the density has a central maximum , and then five local maxima , each subsequent one smaller than the one preceding it .",
    "this star is then evolved without any perturbation except those introduced by the discretization error of the numerical evolution . in fig .",
    "11b we show a contour plot of the evolution of the density function in time .",
    "@xmath132 has @xmath133 maxima for an @xmath134 node star and hence here we initially have 6 sets of lines centered at dimensionless @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively .",
    "this star has central density @xmath165 and it collapses to a black hole after a long evolution . in the process",
    "we see intermediate states with fewer numbers of nodes . for comparison in fig .",
    "11c show the contour plot for the 5 node star upto a time of @xmath166 at which time it has decayed into a four node state , against the equilibrium density function of a 4 node star with central density @xmath167 .",
    "very clearly the maxima are at similar radii ( although the size of the peaks are somewhat different ) .",
    "this feature of nodes disappearing and the star cascading through lower excited states is characteristic of decay of higher excited states of boson stars .",
    "although in this case and at this time the decaying star is close to a specific lower excited state , in general the decaying star is roughly a combination of lower excited configurations .",
    "this is similar to the decay of atoms in excited states .",
    "however , we note that for the `` gravitational atom''[3 ] there is no exact superposition due to the intrinsic non - linearity of the system .",
    "in the first paper in this series , the behavior of boson star ground state configurations under various perturbations were reported . in this paper",
    "the study has been extended to include boson stars of self - interacting field and also the behavior of boson stars in the excited states .",
    "the self - coupling term is important as it can have dramatic effects on the the mass of the boson stars[6 ] leading to boson stars of the order of a solar mass .",
    "the mass profile retains the features of boson stars without self - coupling , having a central maximum with a stable branch and an unstable branch .",
    "all configurations to the left of the central maximum in the mass vs. central density curve ( see fig .  1 )",
    "are stable . under small perturbations",
    "they have very specific quasinormal modes of oscillation as seen in figs .  4 and 6 and under perturbations",
    "they settle down to new configurations on the same branch .",
    "configurations that lie on the unstable or @xmath1-branch , either migrate to new configurations on the @xmath0-branch or collapse to black holes , when perturbed .",
    "these are characteristics shared by boson stars with or without self - coupling .",
    "excited states are configurations with nodes",
    ". the field of an @xmath168 excited state star has @xmath134 nodes and its radial metric has @xmath133 peaks .",
    "their mass profiles are similar to the profiles of boson stars in the ground state , which makes it appear as if they have a stable and an unstable branch of configurations .",
    "however , irrespective of which branch they lie on , excited boson stars are unstable with different instability time scales .",
    "low density excited stars having masses close to ground state configurations will form ground state boson stars after evolution .",
    "denser configurations form black holes with the decay time decreasing with increasing central density till one approaches the density corresponding to zero binding energy .",
    "as the central density approaches this central density the kinetic energy of the star starts to increase as it becomes more dispersive .",
    "it still collapses to a black hole but on a larger time scale . beyond this point for densities corresponding to positive binding energy",
    "the stars disperse to infinity .",
    "we studied the time scales of their instability in figure 9 .",
    "an interesting feature in the collapse of excited state boson stars is that they cascade through intermediate states , during this process , rather like atoms transiting from excited states to the ground state , suggesting that boson stars behave in some ways like gravitational atoms[3 ] .",
    "however , an investigation of the possible decay channels ( selection rules ) seems much more difficult ( if at all possible or meaningful ) here , due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the theory . in this paper",
    "we have reported evolutions of spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "we are currently extending the study to full @xmath169 without spherical symmetry .",
    "the numerical study of @xmath169 boson stars in addition to being an interesting physical problem is also a testbed for 3-dimensional numerical codes , that enable us to study compact self - gravitating objects without having to deal with hydrodynamic sources as in neutron stars , and singularities as in the case of black holes .",
    "in particular we aim to study the general two body problem in relativity by evolving two 3-dimensional scalar field configurations .",
    "the inspiral coalescence of such systems could have interesting physical implications as the gravitational wave emitted does not sensitively depend on the internal structure of the compact objects until the late stages of coalescence . studying the 1-d behavior has been an important tool in testing our 3-d codes , providing testbeds in the spherically symmetric limit .",
    "we are happy to acknowledge helpful discussions with greg daues and malcolm tobias .",
    "this research is supported in part by the mcdonnell center for space sciences , the institute of mathematical science of the chinese university of hong kong , the nsf supercomputing meta center ( mca935025 ) and national science foundation ( phy 96 - 00507 ) .",
    "while calculating the eigenvalue for the equilibrium boson star it is found that it gets increasingly difficult to calculate the eigenvalue as the value of @xmath28 gets large , because the equations get very stiff .",
    "there are two scales to the problem : a scale of slow variation of the field inside a certain radius related to @xmath28 followed by rapid decay outside it .",
    "this makes an effective surface layer to the star making it more similar to neutron stars .",
    "it turns out that the large @xmath28 limit can be treated using a set of approximate equations that are exact in the @xmath170 limit[6 ] . by making the following change of variables : @xmath171 the equilibrium equations reduce to @xmath172{\\bar\\sigma ' } - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\left[\\frac{1}{n^2}-1\\right]{\\bar \\sigma_0}g^2 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda } } ( g^2{\\bar\\sigma_0 ^ 3})\\ ] ] @xmath173 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt { \\lambda}}{\\bar r } g { { \\bar \\sigma_0'^2 } } + \\frac{1}{2}(g^3 { \\bar r } { \\bar \\sigma_0 ^ 4})\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath174.\\ ] ] where the primes refer to differentiation with respect to @xmath175 . in the limit of @xmath176 , one can keep terms to leading order in @xmath177 in ( a2)(a4 ) . in particular ( a2 ) reduces to @xmath178 however , we note that this is valid only for a ground state configuration . for a state with nodes it would not be reasonable to neglect derivative terms compared to terms proportional to @xmath179 , which is zero at a node .    to get an estimate of the accuracy of the high @xmath28 approximation",
    ", we compare the solution using the approximate equation for high @xmath28 to the brute force numerical solution of the complete set of equations , for a @xmath180 , @xmath181 boson star in the ground state in fig .",
    "the agreement of the fields is quite good until the outer region where the approximate equations cause the field to abruptly fall to zero .",
    "comparisons of the radial metric and the lapse are also shown . in the @xmath170",
    "limit the approximate equations are exact and the star really has an outer surface reminiscent of a neutron star .",
    "in fact , an equation of state can be written[6 ] . in fig .",
    "13 the mass and particle number versus central density @xmath182 for high @xmath28 stars is shown .",
    "one expects as in the case of other ground state configurations that the configurations with @xmath183 disperse when perturbed while those on the @xmath1 branch with @xmath184 would be unstable and if unable to migrate to the @xmath0 branch under perturbations would form black holes .",
    "( here we use the symbol @xmath185 for the particle number and not @xmath72 so as not to confuse it with the lapse as both these functions figure prominently in the analysis that follows . ) the particle number is calculated from the current @xmath186 and is given by @xmath187 here @xmath188 has been replaced by @xmath189 and @xmath190 by @xmath191 for the spherically symmetric case . in terms of the @xmath192 coordinates we see that @xmath193 .",
    "next we turn to the determination of the quasi - normal frequency ( qnm ) of the high @xmath28 stars . in principle",
    "one could determine the qnm using the dynamical studies as performed for the @xmath90 case .",
    "however the procedure is extremely computationally expensive .",
    "the scalar field has an inherent oscillation of about @xmath194 and the evolution time steps must be small enough to resolve it .",
    "however the code must run long enough to see a few metric oscillations in order to determine the quasinormal mode . as @xmath28 gets large",
    ", the sizes of the stars also get large leading to a lower frequency of oscillation . in order to determine the qnm we use instead the following perturbation analysis based on[8,11 ] but using our notation for lapse , fields , time , radius and self - coupling as defined in section ii .",
