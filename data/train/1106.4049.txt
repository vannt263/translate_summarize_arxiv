    "game theory was originally developed in the field of economics to study strategic interactions amongst humans @xcite .",
    "the  agents \" who play against each other have a set of  strategies \" to choose from .",
    "the payoff which an agent gets depends on its own strategy and the strategy of the opponent .",

    "are born with fixed strategies instead , @xcite which are considered to be inherited traits . as usual , we assume a population game in which every player effectively plays against the average opponent .",
    "the success of a strategy depends on the number of players of that strategy and also the number of players with other strategies .",
    "a classical example is the lotka - volterra equation @xcite .",
    "if the number of wolves increases then the number of hares will decrease in turn leading to a decrease in the number of wolves .",
    "evolutionary game dynamics studies the change in the frequencies of the strategies @xcite , which depends on mutation , selection and drift .",
    "a recurrent and obvious question asked in the study of games is which is the best strategy ? assuming an infinitely large population we can approach this question by the traditional replicator dynamics @xcite .",
    "the frequency of a strategy will increase if its average payoff is greater than the average payoff of the whole population .",
    "that is , if the individuals of a particular strategy are doing better on average than the individuals of other strategies then that strategy spreads .",
    "the average payoff of a strategy is also dependent on the frequency of the strategy . for",
    "finite populations one must resort to stochastic descriptions @xcite .",
    "one important quantity is the fixation probability .",
    "consider two strategies @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a population of size @xmath2 .",
    "let the population be almost homogenous for @xmath1 with only a single @xmath0 .",
    "if there is no fitness difference amongst the strategies , i.e. selection is neutral , then the probability that the @xmath0 individual will take over the entire population is @xmath3 .",
    "if this probability is greater than @xmath3 we say that strategy @xmath0 is favoured by selection . when there are multiple strategies in the population , then a pair - wise comparison between the fixation probabilities of all the strategies will reveal which is the most abundant strategy @xcite .",
    "this analysis requires the assumption of low mutation rates .",
    "when mutations become more frequent then the concept of fixation itself is problematic and hence also that of fixation probability . in such a case we resort to the average frequency of a strategy which is maintained at the mutation - selection balance",
    "this has been termed as the abundance of a strategy @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath4 strategies which are effectively neutral against each other .",
    "in such a case the abundance of all the strategies in the stationary state will be just @xmath5 .",
    "usually there are fitness differences between the strategies .",
    "if the abundance of a strategy is greater than that of all the other strategies then we can say it is favoured under the effects of mutation , selection and drift .",
    "hence for @xmath4 strategies , the @xmath6 strategy will be favoured if the abundance of @xmath7 is greater than @xmath5 .",
    "calculating the abundance of a strategy is a non - trivial exercise even when assuming weak selection . @xcite",
    "have developed such an approach based on coalescence theory for the case of two - player games and @xmath4 strategies . under certain conditions and",

    "usually two - player interactions are studied in evolutionary game theory .",
    "the analysis of antal et al .",
    "is also for two - player games .",
    "the interactions which we usually use as examples in evolutionary game theory are in general multi - player interactions making the systems nonlinear @xcite . a classical example where a certain minimum number of individuals are required",
    "to complete a task is group hunting .",
    "@xcite studied cooperative hunting in lions .",
    "a typical hunting strategy is to approach the prey from at least three sides to cutoff possible escape paths .",
    "this hunting approach is impossible with only two hunters , i.e.  a two - player game theoretic approach would be insufficient to capture the dynamics . although evolutionary dynamics of multi - player games has received growing interest in the recent years , the main focus has been the public goods game and its variants @xcite .",
    "only few authors consider general evolutionary many person games @xcite .",
    "we extend the approach developed by @xcite for two - player games and multiple strategies to multi - player games .",
    "we show that in the limit of weak selection it is possible to calculate analytical results for @xmath4 strategies and @xmath8 players for arbitrary mutation rates . for a three - player game",
    "the mathematical analysis is described in detail .",
    "it is followed by an example with simulations supporting the analytical result .",
    "lastly we discuss how the methodology can be extended for @xmath8-player games and argue that a general approach is possible , but tedious .",
    "@xcite have developed an approach to find the abundances of @xmath4 strategies in a two - player game ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "for a two - player game even with @xmath4 strategies , the payoff values can be represented in the usual payoff matrix form .",
    "they can be represented as quantities with two indices , @xmath10 .",
    "we increase the complexity first by adding one more player ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this adds another index for the third player s strategy set , @xmath12 . to calculate the average change in the frequency of a strategy we thus need to take into account this payoff ` tensor ' .",
    "we calculate the abundance of a strategy at the mutation - selection equilibrium .",
    "we begin by checking if there is a change in the frequency of a strategy , say @xmath7 on average , due to selection .",
    "the average change under weak selection is given by @xmath13 where the angular brackets denote the average in the neutral stationary state .",
    "the @xmath14 ( selection intensity ) as a lower index on the left hand side , however , denotes that the average is obtained under ( weak ) selection .",
    "if we pick three individuals in the neutral stationary state , then the probability of the first one to have strategy @xmath7 , the next one @xmath15 and the last @xmath16 , is given by the angular brackets in the first sum , @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 denotes the payoff values obtained by a strategy @xmath7 player when pitted against two other players of strategy @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for @xmath4 strategies the sums run from @xmath18 to @xmath4 .",
    "this equation is the special case of a @xmath11 player game .",
    "the derivation for arbitrary @xmath8 is given in [ eq1app ] .",
    "the above equation is similar to the replicator equation , which is also based on the difference between the average payoff of a strategy and the average payoff of the population , but as we will see below , here the averages on the right hand side also include mutations .",
    "to incorporate mutations in the process , we write the total expected change due to mutation and selection as @xmath19 the first term is the change in the frequency in the absence of mutation . in presence of mutations , the second term shows that the frequency can increase by @xmath20 by random mutation and decrease by @xmath21 due to random death .",
    "a mutation means that with a certain probability @xmath22 , the strategy @xmath7 can mutate to any of the @xmath4 strategies .",
    "we are interested in the abundance of a strategy in the stationary state . in the stationary state ,",
    "the average change in frequency is zero , @xmath23 , as the mutations are balanced by selection .",
    "averaging eq .",
    "[ xtot ] under weak selection thus gives us @xmath24 this is our quantity of interest , the abundance of a strategy when the system has reached the stationary state . for @xmath9 player games ,",
    "this quantity is given by @xcite .",
    "for the abundance of a strategy to be greater than neutral , @xmath25 , the change in frequency in the stationary state due to selection must be greater than zero , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we need to resolve the right hand side of equation  [ replike ] .",
    "consider the first term in the brackets . in the neutral stationary state",
    "the number of combinations in the sums reduces due to symmetry , e.g. @xmath27 .",
    "hence , we need to calculate only three different terms , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . also for @xmath8 player games , the terms in the sums are reduced . for the second term in the brackets we need to calculate five different types of averages , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these averages are derived in the [ averagesapp ] . using an approach from coalescence theory , we derive @xmath36 , the probability that @xmath16 individuals chosen from the stationary state all have the same strategy .",

    "if there are less than @xmath53 strategies then @xmath54 vanishes .",

    "let our focal individual play strategy @xmath0 .",
    "the other two players can play any of the three strategies .",
    "this can lead to a potential complication .",
    "consider the combinations @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "if the order of players does not matter , then both these configurations give the same payoffs but if they do matter then we need to consider them separately . here",

    "we need to add an index in the sums , @xmath86 the first term is comparatively simple as we already know all the different ways of picking four individuals . for the second term",
    "we need to know the different possible combinations of strategies when picking five individuals from the neutral stationary state .    for @xmath8 players and @xmath4 strategies we can construct an expression analogous to eq .  [ replike ] .",

    "we see that in the first sum the averages are for choosing @xmath8 players but for the second it is @xmath75 .",
    "hence we need to calculate the probabilities of the form @xmath90 , but @xmath90 depends on @xmath91 .",
    "thus we have to solve the expression recursively e.g. for @xmath92 , we will need to pick @xmath93 players at most and we must solve the expression for @xmath94 before ( @xmath9 has been solved by @xcite and @xmath11 in this paper ) . as @xmath8 increases calculating @xmath90 is not enough and we will also need to calculate terms such as @xmath95 which is already the case for @xmath11 .",
    "games with two strategies have been very well studied . in two - player games with two strategies , one strategy can replace another with a higher probability if the sum of its payoff values is greater than the sum of the payoff values of the other strategy .",

    "recently it has been shown that this result can be generalized for @xmath8-player games with two strategies @xcite .",

    "this yields @xmath102 which is exactly the condition that has been obtained previously using different methods and different notation by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to demonstrate the power of the approach we are motivated by @xcite who studies the problem of task allocation and of the evolution of division of labour .",
    "@xcite studied a two - player game between task @xmath18 specialists ( @xmath103 ) , task @xmath104 specialists ( @xmath105 ) and generalists .",
    "instead , we have @xmath103 , @xmath105 and freeloaders @xmath106",
    ". we can think of this problem in context of bacteria that need two types of enzymes to obtain resources from the environment .",
    "one strain produces one type of enzyme at a cost @xmath107 and another strain produces the second type of enzyme at a cost of @xmath108 .",
    "we also have the freeloading strain which does not produce any enzyme but can get resources by the help of the other two strains .",
    "the benefit of getting the resources is given by @xmath109 .",
    "we have the condition that the total cost is less than the benefit accrued i.e. @xmath110 .",
    "further assume that our contenders are conservative in the enzyme production .",
    "sensing who they are pitted against , the strains share the costs of producing the enzyme .",
    "thus a two - player payoff matrix for such a setting can be written down as in table [ 2plpaytabex ] .",
    "it is hard to imagine though that the bacteria interact only in a pair - wise fashion .",
    "although it is hard to judge how many players are interacting , we can at least increase the complexity by one more player and study what effect this has on the abundances of the strains .",
    "therefore , we study the system in a three - player setting . in this case",
