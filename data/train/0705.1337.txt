    "<S> we investigate the role of lifetime effects from resonances and emission duration tails in femtoscopy at rhic in two blast - wave models . </S>",
    "<S> we find the non - gaussian components compare well with published source imaged data , but the value of @xmath0 obtained from gaussian fits is not insensitive to the non - gaussian contributions when realistic acceptance cuts are applied to models .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have produced a series of remarkable results including the discovery of jet - quenching through the suppression of high @xmath1 particles  @xcite and the observation of hydrodynamic flow  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complete set of measurements point to the existence of a dense partonic medium  @xcite that evolves hydrodynamically from the time of thermalization until freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> several hydrodynamic models have succeeded in reproducing measured spectra and flow  @xcite , but with the exception of parameterized fits to the data  @xcite , they have not reproduced the space - time measurements for the particle emission region  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while some the models match the systematic trends of the longitudinal gaussian extent , @xmath2 , they produce an extent which is too large in the transverse component of the particle pair emission direction,@xmath0 , too small in the orthogonal transverse direction , @xmath3 , or both . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of these two measurement , @xmath4 , has been suggested as an indication of the duration of the freeze - out emission stage  @xcite , and its near unitary value for a wide range of colliding systems , geometry , and center - of - mass energy in light of the disagreement with hydrodynamic models has been called the `` hbt puzzle '' .    the traditional spatial - temporal analysis of the particle emission region in a high energy collision pioneered by goldhaber , goldhaber , lee , and pais  @xcite assumes a parameterized source shape , usually gaussian , which is fit to a measured enhancement in the two - particle momentum distribution at low relative momentum . the physical basis for this technique is analagous to intesity interferemetry techniques developed by hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt )  @xcite for which the technique is often named . </S>",
    "<S> it has been applied mostly to pairs of identical pions emitted in both lepton and hadron collisions , but the greatest interest has been generated in the heavy ion collisions , where space - time measurements hold the promise of providing constraints on the nuclear matter equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the technique has since advanced in many ways , incorporating a variety of systematic dependencies on pair momentum , collision geometry , reaction plane and a decomposition of the source emission region into three cartesian radii , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and cross - terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , the need to parameterize the source distribution by its `` lengths of homogeneity ''   @xcite has remained a fundamental limitation ( see  @xcite for a recent review and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation is underscored by the application of three - pion correlations to rule out coherent pion production as an explanation for the non - unitary value of the correlation strength , @xmath8 , which provides evidence for a complex source shape consisting of core and extended halo  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the tools to resolve non - gaussian components have recently been provided by a source imaging technique  @xcite and the first evidence of non - gaussian tails have been observed by the phenix experiment in 200 gev centereal au+au collisions  @xcite , thereby demonstrating the ability to image non - gaussian sources and resolve contributions from an extended lifetime and/or resonance halo . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the role of these two contributions to an extended source distribution has important consequences for the  hbt puzzle \" and the limitations of traditional techniques . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will explore these limitations and their implications using two models to decouple the relative contributions from lifetime effects and resonance decays .    </S>",
    "<S> our first model uses a blast - wave flow profile for the source distribution  @xcite , but substitutes exponential time emission and gaussian longitudinal profiles for a gaussian in proper time and an infinite bjorken tube . </S>",
    "<S> this model also includes a resonance contribution from @xmath9 feeddown . </S>",
    "<S> the building blocks for our two - particle source are the normalized particle emission rates for the core and halo : @xmath10 the core component ( fraction = @xmath11 ) , consists of a gaussian spatial part , an exponential time profile , and a momentum dependence arising from hydro - like boltzman factor : @xmath12 here , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are all adjustable and are specified in the lab frame . for this study </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath18 mev , @xmath19 , @xmath20  fm , and @xmath21  fm / c . </S>",
    "<S> the flow profile is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters were chosen arbitrarily since this paper is a generic study of the time profile and @xmath9 contributions to the source distribution . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the blast - wave fits of retiere and lisa  @xcite for central collisions converged for @xmath26  fm ( equivalent to a 2d rms gaussian radius of 6.5  fm ) , @xmath27  mev , and @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> following earlier work on the contribution of resonance decays to the pion source distribution  @xcite , we assume that the halo is dominated by the decay of the @xmath9 resonance ( @xmath29 fm / c ) , with a fractional contribution of 50% to the pion distribution in the region of @xmath30  gev . </S>",
    "<S> other potential candidate resonances have decay times that are much too short , e.g. the @xmath31 with lifetime @xmath32 fm / c , or too long , e.g. the @xmath33 with lifetime @xmath34 fm / c or have charged pionic decay modes with small branching fractions . the @xmath9 s are emitted from the same core , but we allow them to propagate classically for some distance before decaying into pions : @xmath35 we include the dominant three - body reaction @xmath36 with a branching fraction of 88.8% and define the probability , @xmath37 , for finding a @xmath38 with momentum @xmath39 from the decay of the @xmath9 with momentum @xmath40 , using standard three - body decay kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the only other charged pion decay mode of the @xmath9 which is @xmath41 with a branching fraction of 2.2% . </S>",
    "<S> this mode would only have a negligible impact on the source distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> this source function for the probability to emit a pair with a separation of @xmath42 in the pair cm frame is given by  @xcite @xmath43    we construct the source function from this single particle source by monte - carlo integrating our emission function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : sou - def ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we work in bertsch - pratt coordinates @xcite , so that the time integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : sou - def ] ) serves to move the time effects into the outward and longitudinal directions . to compare to the 1d , angle - averaged source image for central au - au collisions recently measured by phenix  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we keep only pairs where both pions have a pseudo - rapidity @xmath44 and transverse momentum @xmath45 @xmath46 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also applied the star acceptance cuts in pseudo - rapidity , @xmath47 , but found no qualitative difference .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ compare ] , we plot our  baseline \" model source function as 1-fm slices along the various directions in the bertsch - pratt coordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> the top three panels show slices for @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 , respectively , and the bottom panel shows the full angle - averged source ( @xmath48 term in a spherical harmonic expansion of the source ) . </S>",
    "<S> all distributions are normalized to one for the full distributions , and all slices are plotted in the pair center - of - mass ( pcms ) frame . </S>",
    "<S> slices are also shown for various modifications to the baseline model , in which extended time distribution is turned off ( `` instant freeze - out '' ) and/or @xmath9 contribution is removed . </S>",
    "<S> the baseline model is also shown for the full @xmath49 acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> the non - gaussian shape in the sidewards direction is due entirely to the @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the longitudinal component , where @xmath49 acceptance cuts virtually eliminate the lifetime effects . </S>",
    "<S> the outwards distribution for the @xmath9-less , instant freeze - out distribution shows the effect of kinematic boost of the pcms frame , which varies from 1.7 to 2.8 over the transverse momentum range in this bin . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 and extended lifetime contribute significantly above 30  fm , although their combined contributions have a less discernible impact . </S>",
    "<S> the removal of the @xmath49 acceptance cuts has the effect of reducing the impact of these contributions along the outwards slice . </S>",
    "<S> the angle averaged distribution shows less sensitivity to the individual contributions to the long range source . </S>",
    "<S> the angle averaged sources for the model with and without the extended lifetime effects ( but with @xmath9 included ) appear to be consistent with the phenix measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> the dot - dashed line in each plot shows the 1  fm gaussian slices for the 3d bertsch - pratt fit to the generated correlation function ( no coulomb ) for the baseline model in the pcms frame , and the bottom panel shows the angle - average of this function . </S>",
    "<S> fit results for all model variations are tabulated in table  [ radii ] . </S>",
    "<S> the sidewards and longitudinal slices show a significant departure from the gaussian shape above 15  fm , yet the outwards distribution remains gaussian in shape out to 40  fm , significantly beyond the 30  fm that one would expect from a pure kinematic boost to the pcms . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the gaussian fits to the outwards is also evident in the radii reported in table  [ radii ] . beginning with the pure gaussian input source ( no @xmath9 , @xmath50=0 ) the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 increase by @xmath5110% when </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 is included , and @xmath2 increases half as much when only the emission tail is added . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the value of @xmath0 increases by @xmath5160% for either the @xmath9 or emission tail alone , and another @xmath5140% when both are included .    </S>",
    "<S> .comparison of the best fit gaussian parameters in each of the cases we consider . </S>",
    "<S> we fit directly to the correlation function in each case . in order to avoid complications due to the coulomb correction </S>",
    "<S> , we generated the correlations without the coulomb effect for the purpose of fitting . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ radii ]    in order to investigate these effects in a more complex dynamical model with a complete resonance contribution with decay channel properties taken from the particle data book  @xcite we show comparable results from the therminator program  @xcite in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ comparebw ] . </S>",
    "<S> this model includes a three - dimensional freeze - out hypersurface similar to the blast - wave models  @xcite including radial flow but no emission duration . </S>",
    "<S> particles are created at this hypersurface and propagate freely ( without hadronic rescattering ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model has been shown to reproduce a large set of data in the soft sector of the rhic collisions  @xcite , and the absolute and relative yields of particle species are taken from a thermal model which decribes rhic data well . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions shown in fig .  [ comparebw ] are taken from the best - fit parameters  @xcite : t=165.6  mev , @xmath52 = 28.5  mev , @xmath53 = 8.55 fm / c , @xmath54 = 8.92  fm , @xmath55 = 0.311 , using a negative slope in @xmath56 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the top three panels show 1-fm wide slices along each of the bertsch - pratt coordinates for the same acceptance cuts , @xmath44 and @xmath30  gev . for each panel </S>",
    "<S> we show the full source ( all resonances ) , the full source without the @xmath9 , and the primordial pion source . </S>",
    "<S> the full source is normalized to unity , and for the others we retain the relative normalization according their contribution to the two - particle source distributions . for the gaussian slices </S>",
    "<S> , we overlay the 1-fm slices from bowler - sinyukov fits to the full correlation source for a similar @xmath57 region ( average of radii from two bins spanning @xmath58  gev / c from  @xcite ) . to plot the outwards distributions in the pcms frame , </S>",
    "<S> we multiply the lcms @xmath0 fit value by 2.05 , corresponding to the kinematic boost for a mean @xmath57 of 0.25  gev / c . again </S>",
    "<S> we see that the outwards slice of the distribution shows the best agreement with a guassian , out to @xmath5138  fm in the pcms ( or @xmath5119  fm in the unboosted lcms ) , while the slices along other bertsch - pratt axes deviate from gaussians around 10  fm for longitudinal and 6  fm for sidewards . </S>",
    "<S> if one projects instead of slices , as was done for fig . </S>",
    "<S> 11 of  @xcite , the gaussian shapes extend further in the sidewards and longitudinal directions . </S>",
    "<S> the angle - averaged therminator distribution including all resonances falls below the phenix image above 20  fm , but accounts for @xmath5130% of the tail in this region .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from this and the previous model comparison that the @xmath9 is an essential component in the first non - gaussian tail measured at rhic , but there is sufficient room for contributions from non - gaussian lifetime effects . </S>",
    "<S> the observed sensitivity of the @xmath0 parameter to the inclusion of lifetime effects is surprising , and is contrary to our initial expectations based on an analysis without any experimental acceptance cuts in which the @xmath0 parameter showed little change . only with </S>",
    "<S> the application of the phenix / star @xmath49-cuts did the variation appear . </S>",
    "<S> this does not rule out the presence of lifetime effects , but implies that such affects may already be partially accounted for in the standard gaussian fits . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the fitted value of @xmath0 for the first model is consistent with published pcms value for @xmath0 for a similar @xmath57 range  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this analysis also underscores the need to perform source imaging in three dimensions as the most promising way to disentangle the @xmath9 , which has significant contributions in all directions , from the lifetime effects that are restricted to the outwards direction . </S>",
    "<S> the source - imaging of kaons will provide another , more direct means to probe non - gaussian components of primordial source lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> equally important to the task of understanding the complete space - time picture will be comprehensive set of comparisons to the full source distributions from hydrodynamic models with resonances included . </S>"
