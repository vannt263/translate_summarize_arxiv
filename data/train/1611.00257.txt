    "thanks to exotic nonlinear electromagnetic properties of graphene @xcite , the latter is extensively considered as an active material for diverse optical applications @xcite .",

    "when a static uniform magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the graphene plane , the electron energy is quantized forming nonequidistant landau levels ( lls ) . as a consequence , in the graphene the anomalous quantum hall effect takes place @xcite .    while most of the works have concentrated on static or linear optical properties of the landau - quantized graphene , one direction that has not been fully explored",
    "is the nonlinear response of landau - quantized graphene to a strong coherent radiation .",

    "@xcite the nonlinear optical response of graphene and semiconductor - hetero - structures to a moderately strong laser radiation in the quantum hall regime , in particular , radiation intensity at the 3rd harmonic , as well as nonlinear faraday effect have been investigated .",
    "it has been shown that 3rd harmonic radiation intensity has a characteristic hall plateau structures that persist for a wide range of the pump wave frequencies and intensities even for significant broadening of landau levels because of impurities in graphene . with further increase of pump wave intensity and due to the peaks in the density of states one",
    "can also expect enhancement of the high harmonics radiation power in landau - quantized graphene .",
    "hence , it is of interest to consider high harmonics generation process in the ultrastrong wave - graphene coupling regime .",
    "moreover , the energy range of interest lies in the thz and mid infrared domain where high - power generators and frequency multipliers are of special interest .    in the present work ,",
    "a microscopic theory of the landau - quantized graphene interaction with strong coherent electromagnetic radiation is presented .",
    "our calculations show that one can achieve efficient generation of high harmonics with strong radiation fields  when the work of the wave electric field on the magnetic length is considerably larger than pump photon energy . at that for optimization",
    "we investigate high harmonics generation process depending on the pump wave frequency , intensity and broadening of lls .",
