    "modern theories of structure formation in the early universe suggest that galaxies have formed out of a primordial generation of stars , with zero - like metal abundances , the so - called population iii stars .",
    "our understanding of the general properties of pop iii stars has improved significantly over the past recent years ( see barkana & loeb 2001 , bromm & larson 2004 for recent reviews ) . the mass distribution of this first generation(s ) of stars , however , remains ill - determined .",
    "according to recent hydrodynamical models ( abel , bryan & norman 2000 , bromm , copi & larson 1999 , 2002 ) the first stars are very massive ( @xmath0 ) , primarily because of the poor efficiency of the dominant cooling mechanism , due to molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) rotational transitions .",
    "other calculations , however , find that the formation of pop iii stars following the very first - generation stars may extend to the @xmath2 - 10 @xmath3 range , depending on the protogalactic gas cloud conditions ( nakamura & umemura 2001 , 2002 ) , the effect of the intense radiation field ( omukai & yoshii 2003 ) or on the efficiency of metal - enriched ( pop ii.5 ) star formation due to supernovae ( mackey , bromm & hernquist 2003 , salvaterra , ferrara & schneider 2003 ) . in that case ,",
    "primordial star formation may have led to an early generation of extremely or totally ( in the absence of mixing of the ejected material in the sn - driven shell in the ism ) metal - depleted , long - live low - mass stars .",
    "the minimum mass for star formation in the early universe thus remains uncertain .",
    "this minimum mass , however , is likely to decrease with time , as ( i ) the virial temperature of massive collapsing halos will exceed @xmath4 , inducing radiative line - cooling from atomic hydrogen , ( ii ) the minimum ambient temperature , set up by the cosmic background radiation , will decrease and so will the thermal jeans mass , and ( iii ) a small fraction of metals will be processed in the primordial short - lived stars , yielding a much more efficient cooling mechanism ( clarke & bromm 2003 , bromm & loeb 2003 ) . when the transition between pop iii+ii.5 , hereafter defined generically as our `` primordial star generation '' , to well identified pop ii - like stars",
    "is occurring remains unknown , depending on ill - determined factors such as the effect of the ambient uv radiation on the main coolants or the efficiency of the medium heavy element enrichment due to the first snii generations .",
    "the evolution of the initial mass function ( imf ) from the ( nearly - zero @xmath5 ) pop iii to ( low-@xmath5 ) pop ii may in fact correspond to transition from a high - mass to a low - mass fragmentation mode of star formation , illustrating the evolution of the imf with structure formation in the universe .",
    "the recent discovery of a very metal - depleted ( @xmath6=-5.3\\pm 0.2]$ ] ) red giant ( @xmath7 ) in our galactic halo ( christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ) indeed points to such a low - mass mode of primordial star generation .",
    "moreover , the metal enrichment of clusters of galaxies suggests an imf at high redshift with an average stellar mass larger than for present - day conditions , in the range @xmath2-@xmath8 ( portinari et al . 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "such an evolution bears important consequences on the early history and the subsequent evolution of the universe .",
    "while the uv radiation and @xmath9-element nucleosynthesis will be dominated by the more massive objects , a primordial , high - redshift stellar population extending to masses below about 10 @xmath3 will ( i ) extend the nucleosynthetic products to c , n and fe enriched elements as well as s - processed elements and ( ii ) produce a population of white dwarfs ( wds ) sequestering part of the baryons .",
    "the quest for the direct detection of these remnants remains for now inconclusive , for present surveys do not reach deep enough magnitude or have a too small field of view to reach robust conclusions .",
    "an alternative observable signature of the presence of a primordial remnant population in today galactic halos would be their contribution to these halo surface brightness .",
    "n - body simulations ( white & springel 2000 ) suggest that the primordial star clusters might survive disruption during halo merging preceding galaxy formation and , through loss of kinetic energy by dynamical friction , end up in the central bulge , with low velocity .",
    "if , however , the low - mass stars are scattered by violent relaxation or tidal disruption of the cluster during halo merging , the remnants of these early stars would be now incorporated into galactic external halos . which of these two processes dominates remains to be determined unambiguously and depends on various factors such as the mass ratio and the compactness of the mergers or the efficiency of the sn - driven winds in the clusters .",
    "in the present paper we will assume that the primordial remnant population follows the isothermal density distribution of the dark halo .",
    "if these remnants are located in the central bulge or spheroid , their surface brightness will be largely dominated by the main sequence ( m - dwarfs ) contribution . in that case",
    "only spectroscopic and high - proper motion detections of individual objects will allow their identification as popiii remnants .",
    "the nature of these primordial remnants ( black holes , neutron stars or white dwarfs ) carries the signature of the minimum mass of the imf at the early epoch of star formation in the universe . since the surface brightness does not depend on the distance ( see below )",
    ", the integration along the line of sight of several galactic dark halos adds up each contribution , yielding eventually a detectable signature . both the observation or the _ non _ observation of such a stellar relic radiation",
    "would bring important information on the low - mass end of the stellar mass spectrum and thus on the dominant process of star formation in the early universe .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper to examine this issue .",
    "as mentioned above , several arguments suggest that the imf was more top - heavy at high redshift than in present day environment .",
    "figure [ f1.ps ] illustrates the possible variation of the imf from popiii+ii.5 , formed at high - redshift ( @xmath10 or so ) with very low metal enrichment ( @xmath11 ) , to popii stars , with @xmath12 to -1.0 , characteristic of the spheroid and globular cluster population , to solar metallicity popi stars representative of the disk population .",
    "these imfs correspond to eqns .",
    "( 17 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 24 ) ( see also tables 1 and 2 ) of chabrier ( 2003 ) , respectively .",
    "these imfs are best described by a power - law at large masses rolling down to a lognormal form below some characteristic mass , a behaviour expected from turbulence - driven fragmentation ( padoan & nordlund 2002 ) , but can be approximated by the following form , as initially suggested by larson ( 1986 ) :    @xmath13 \\label{imf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as mentioned above , it is unclear whether a wd - dominated primordial imf such as the one displayed in figure [ f1.ps ] is representative of the primordial popiii+ii.5 stellar generation .",
    "however , as argued above , different calculations suggest that the next to very first stellar generation may extend into this domain .",
    "moreover , the aforementioned recent observation of a 0.8 @xmath3 red giant with a strong iron depletion ( @xmath6=-5.3 $ ] ) suggests indeed that the primordial imf quickly evolved into the wd progenitor mass range . in order ( i ) to maximize the contribution from the putative wd - progenitor population and thus estimate the maximum constraint on this population , and ( ii ) to examine the dependence of the diffuse radiation upon the imf and thus wd mean mass @xmath14 , we chose for illustration the imf suggested by chabrier , segretain & mra ( 1996 ) , with @xmath15 ( their imf1 ) , yielding @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( their imf2 ) , which yields @xmath18 .",
    "an important constraint on the presence of such a primordial remnant population is the contribution of its progenitors to the energy content of the universe , i.e. to the cosmic background light .",
    "this contribution was first estimated by madau and pozzetti ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors , however , used solar - metallicity or only slightly metal - depleted ( 1% @xmath19 ) stellar evolution models to evaluate this contribution . for a given mass ,",
    "zero - metallicity stars are brighter and thus put more severe constraints on the related energy background .",
    "more recently santos , bromm & kamionkowski ( 2002 ) carried out more detailed calculations .",
    "they considered , however , only very massive stars ( @xmath20 ) and found out that the spectral properties of these stars are essentially independent of mass , when normalized to unit stellar mass , so that the integrated spectrum of such a population depends only on its total mass , not on the imf .",
    "this result does not hold anymore for lower mass stars , and has been shown recently to be partially incorrect even for the highest mass stars ( schaerrer 2002 ) .",
    "more recently , salvaterra & ferrara ( 2003 ) and magliocchetti , salvaterra & ferrara ( 2003 ) have shown that pop iii stars formed at @xmath21 can contribute appreciably , possibly entirely to the detected residual ( i.e. after galaxy contribution subtraction ) nirb radiation , without major conflict with the igm observed metallicity limits .",
    "all these calculations suggest that a substantial fraction of the collapsed ( virialized ) baryons , @xmath22 to 60% depending on the primordial imf and the redshift range of formation , may have been turned into this primordial generation of stars .",
    "this point is illustrated below .",
    "following madau & pozzetti ( 2000 ) , we calculate the bolometric extragalactic background light per steradian @xmath23 observed at earth today ( @xmath24 ) , due to a burst of formation of primordial stars of zero - metallicity at time @xmath25 , i.e. redshift @xmath26 .",
    "since zero - metallicity stars are brighter and hotter than their metal - enriched counterparts , they evolve more quickly and the redshift dependence of the produced light is likely to differ from the estimate of madau & pozzetti ( 2000 ) .",
    "a star - burst approximation is reasonable since primordial star formation is believed to have occurred somewhere between @xmath27 - 30 , when small scale halos were formed from primordial fluctuations , and @xmath28 , about the end of the reionization . in the standard cosmological model adopted in the present calculations , @xmath29 , this spans @xmath30 yrs , a fairly short time compared with the age of the universe today , @xmath31 gyr .",
    "the @xmath23 is given by :    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    is the total bolometric luminosity density for a stellar formation rate per comoving volume @xmath34 and    @xmath35    is the luminosity produced by a stellar population of same age @xmath36 , from a minimum mass @xmath37 to a maximum mass @xmath38 .",
    "we use the zero - metallicity evolutionary sequences of marigo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the term @xmath41 denotes the luminosity of a star with mass @xmath42 at age @xmath36 , and @xmath43 is the imf normalized such that the total stellar mass @xmath44 . for a burst sfr , eqn.([rhobol ] ) reduces to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mass density under the form of stars .",
    "figure [ f2.ps ] displays @xmath47 expected for the aforedescribed population of primordial stars as a function of redshift of formation @xmath26 for various mass fractions @xmath48 of baryons under the form of stars at redshift @xmath49 :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the universe critical density and @xmath52 is the baryon density in units of @xmath53 .",
    "the observed ( frequency - integrated ) brightness of the cosmic background radiation today is @xmath54 nw m@xmath55 sr@xmath56 , with a lower limit @xmath57 nw m@xmath55 sr@xmath56 ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) , indicated by the dotted line in the figure .",
    "these calculations are by no means as accurate as the detailed calculations mentioned earlier .",
    "in particular they do not incorporate other contributions like e.g. normal galaxies .",
    "however , they illustrate the fact that a significant mass fraction of primordial stars , possibly as much as @xmath58 can be formed at redshift @xmath59 and contribute a diffuse background light today well below the observed lower limit .",
    "since the imf extends in the wd - progenitor range and since wd progenitors return about 70% of their mass to the ism with the imf ( [ imf ] ) ( assuming a similar wd - mass vs progenitor - mass relationship as for the disk wds ) , this implies that , in principle , as much as @xmath60 of the nucleosynthetic baryon density can be trapped in a population of remnants from a primordial generation of low - mass stars .",
    "this is of course a large overestimate of the true fraction of baryons possibly processed into popiii+ii.5 remnants .",
    "this fraction can be estimated as follows .",
    "the fraction of collapsed baryons at @xmath61 is @xmath62 ( haiman & loeb 1997 , abel et al .",
    "1998 , bromm et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the star formation efficiency in today star - forming regions range from @xmath63 to 0.3 and , as mentioned above , may reach @xmath64 at high redshift ( salvaterra & ferrara ( 2003 ) , magliocchetti et al . 2003 ) . given an estimate of @xmath65 from the observation of local galaxies , where @xmath66 is the escape fraction of ionizing photons within these protogalaxies , this is consistent with the constraint @xmath67 from the wmap thomson optical depth and the lack of h i gunn - peterson through at @xmath68 ( fig . 5 of wyithe & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "this yields a fraction of bbn bayons @xmath69 - 10% possibly processed into popiii+ii.5 stars at large redshift .",
    "recent studies suggest that the direct detection of the radiation of these primordial star clusters , responsible for the universe reionization , might be in reach of the jwst or even the hst missions ( venkatesan & truran 2003 , stiavelli , fall & panagia 2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand , with the type of imf mentioned earlier , about 30% of these baryons might be under the form of wd remnants in galactic halos today .",
    "the photometric signature of such a remnant population in galactic halos is examined below .",
    "the mass fraction @xmath70 , where @xmath71 pc@xmath72 is the local dark matter density , of wd remnants in the milky way halo , issued from the primordial low - mass star generation considered in the previous section , remains presently undetermined .",
    "the value inferred from microlensing experiments has been steadily decreasing over the years , and is now estimated to be between @xmath73 and @xmath7420% ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 , afonso et al . 2003 ) , with @xmath75 at the 95% c.l . from the eros team .",
    "a @xmath76 population of these halo wds has been claimed to have been identified recently from kinematic and spectroscopic observations ( oppenheimer et al .",
    "although this result remains highly controversial ( see e.g. reid , sahu & hawley 2001 , reyl , robin & crz 2001 , flynn , holopainen & holmberg 2003 ) , a detailed analysis of the age and kinematic properties of these objects seems to confirm that part of the sample does belong to the galactic halo ( hansen 2001 ) .",
    "present surveys , however , either have too small field of views or do not reach faint enough magnitudes to detect the peak of the halo wd luminosity function and thus the majority of such a halo wd population remains presently out of reach ( chabrier 1999a figure 1 ) . as pointed out by chabrier ( 1999a ) , the only robust constraint yielding an upper limit for @xmath77 ( besides the maximum baryonic fraction estimated in  3 ) , arises from stellar nucleosynthesis of helium and heavy element production .",
    "recent detailed calculations seem to exclude a value @xmath781% to 10% ( fields , freese , & graff 2000 , brook , kawata & gibson 2001 ) . in any events , a primordial , high - velocity ( @xmath79 km s@xmath56 ) wd population with @xmath80 , as suggested by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , would exceed significantly the wd population expected in the galactic spheroid , @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 ( gould , flynn & bahcall 1998 , chabrier 2003 table 3 ) , and would thus imply a primordial imf different from the one characteristic of today environments . at any rate , the identification of any halo wd population would bring precious information about the minimum mass for star formation at early stages of galactic formation .",
    "it is thus interesting to explore the expected diffuse emission of such a population .    following the formulation of adams & walker ( 1990 ) ,",
    "we calculate the radiation signature of a wd population with mass fraction @xmath77 in an isothermal halo .",

    "this describes the evolution of so - called da wds , with hydrogen rich atmospheres , the most likely population , given wd accretion rates ( chabrier 1999b ) . at any rate , da wds , for a given age , will be order of magnitude brighter than helium - rich atmosphere so - called db wds , and",

    "the background light contribution of these wds is found to increase appreciably with redshift , suggesting possible detection in dedicated surveys , with appropriate color cuts .",
    "contributions from red giants and main sequence stars at these redshifts , however , must be calculated consistently with chemico - evolution models , in order to examine the favored detection bands .",
    "the author is indebted to the erskine foundation and the department of physics and astronomy of the university of canterbury , where this work was completed , for their wonderful hospitality .",

    "<S> such a halo diffuse radiation is below the detection limit of present large field ground - based surveys , but should be observable with the hst and with the future jwst project . since the surface brightness does not depend on the distance , the integration of several galactic dark halos along the line of sight will raise appreciably the chances of detection . </S>",
    "<S> both the detection or the non - detection of such a remnant diffuse radiation within relevant detection limits offer valuable information on the minimum mass for star formation in the early universe and on the evolution of the stellar initial mass function . </S>"
