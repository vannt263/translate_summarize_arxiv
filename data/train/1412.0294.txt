    "the constant @xmath62 can be obtained by directly observing @xmath32f , but it is not allowed in our nmr spectrometer .",
    "fortunately , @xmath62 is acquired by doing a swap gate to transfer the state of @xmath32f to the work qubit ( @xmath30c ) and then observing @xmath30c , instead of observing @xmath32f directly .",
    "the swap gate is realized using the shaped pulse whose total time is 7.5@xmath68 .",
    "the spectrum similar with the lower part of fig .",
    "3(b ) is obtained by implementing a swap operator after preparing the pseudo - pure state , implying that this operator is accurate .",
    "analogously , the spectrum of @xmath30c after doing the swap operator behind the entire sequence gives four signals proportional to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , from these four signals one can precisely determine all three unknown constants @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . and obtain the intensities @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "according to figure 4 , our results present a general agreement between the quantum mechanical predictions and the experiments .",
    "it indicates that hv theories fail to explain the results of entanglement - assisted quantum delayed - choice experiment .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the sources of the errors in the experimental implementation of the pulse sequence shown in fig . 3(a ) . excluding the state initialization ,",
    "the number of radio - frequency pulses is about 30 with experiment duration being about 28@xmath68 for the case that a swap gate is included .",
    "total error is magnified , although each pulse has small error .",
    "therefore , a dominant source of errors originated from the imperfect selective @xmath76-pulse used .",
    "the signal loss is also caused by some experimental factors like @xmath77 effects , the measurement ( determination of the constants @xmath61,@xmath62 and @xmath63 ) errors and the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field .",
    "it is acceptable that some experimental results drift off the theoretical curves , but the accuracy of experimental results is enough to reveal the incompatibility between the basic assumptions of hv theories and quantum mechanics .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath30c in diethyl - fluoromalonate used is un - labeled , as a result , the desired signal is vulnerable to the environmental noise .",
    "signal - noise ratio can be improved by using @xmath30c - labeled diethyl - fluoromalonate or the experiment being performed many more times .",
    "if these factors can be overcome , a better agreement between quantum mechanical predictions and the experimental results can be achieved .    for @xmath30c - unlabeled diethyl - fluoromalonate ,",
    "rotating the state of the @xmath32f nuclei is more imprecise than other two qubits ( @xmath30c and @xmath31h ) , and hence @xmath32f can be set to the logical qubit which needs the least operations to achieve more precise manipulation .",
    "the @xmath78-coupling constant between @xmath30c and @xmath32f ( @xmath79hz ) is maximum in all three @xmath78-coupling constants .",
    "it indicates that the @xmath78-coupling evolution between @xmath30c and @xmath32f contributes to decease @xmath77 effects , because the experiment duration is proportional to @xmath80 , but the calculations of the intensities @xmath47 and @xmath48 will become more complicated .    we have presented an experimental demonstration of entanglement - assisted quantum delayed - choice scheme using nmr spectrometer which provides a prefect platform to study the relationship between quantum mechanics and hv theories .",
    "our experiment not only demonstrated continuous morphing of quantum systems between wave - like and particle - like behavior , but also tested the predictions of quantum mechanics and hv theories .",
    "an entanglement assisted version of quantum delayed - choice experiment can be also carried out in other quantum systems , such as , the entangled photon system @xcite .",
    "experiments are carried out on a bruker avance iii 400mhz nmr spectrometer with diethyl - fluoromalonate dissolved in @xmath36-acetone at 295.0k as the quantum information processor .",

    "3(a ) of the main text .",
    "the natural hamiltonian of the three - qubit system is as follow , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the larmor frequency of the @xmath83th nuclei and @xmath84 is the @xmath78-coupling constant between the @xmath83th and the @xmath85th nuclei .",

    "the larmor frequency of @xmath30c,@xmath31h and @xmath32f are 101mhz , 63mhz and 376mhz , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is feasible that the hard pulse can selectively only excites the transition of one nucleus without changing the states of other qubits . in our experiments ,",
    "the duration time of each pulse is tens of microseconds , and hence the causing undesired free - evolution can be ignored .",
