    "due to the coulomb interaction , an electron approaching a metal surface can excite a core electron into a state of the unoccupied bands . above a threshold energy both",
    ", the excited core electron and the de - excited primary electron are scattered into valence states just above the fermi energy .",
    "the appearance - potential spectroscopy ( aps ) @xcite monitors the intensity of this radiationless transition as a function of the energy of the primary electrons by detecting the emitted x - rays or auger electrons of the subsequent core - hole decay . since core - hole formation is involved , the method is element specific and local .",
    "its comparatively simple experimental setup and its surface sensitivity qualifies aps as a useful technique for surface analysis . for a ferromagnetic material ,",
    "the spin dependence of the ap signal obtained by using a polarized electron beam reflects the surface magnetization as has been demonstrated for the transition metals fe and ni .",
    "@xcite in a sense aps can be considered to be complementary to auger - electron spectroscopy ( aes ) .",
    "@xcite while the auger line shape resulting from core - valence - valence ( cvv ) transitions yields information on the occupied part of the valence band , aps is sensitive to the unoccupied electronic structure .",
    "contrary to @xmath0 resolved ( inverse ) photoemission , the ap transition is more or less localized in real space .",
    "this suggests to employ aps as a quantitative probe for the unoccupied part of the ( spin - dependent ) local valence density of states ( dos ) .    in most cases the interpretation of appearance - potential spectra is still based on a simple independent - electron model suggested by lander in 1953 : @xcite hereafter , the line shape is given by the self - convolution of the unoccupied part of the dos .",
    "the desired information can then be obtained by de - convolution techniques .",
    "@xcite within the context of aes , however , it soon became clear that the self - convolution model seems to be oversimplified .",
    "powell @xcite discovered an `` anomalous '' shape of the cvv auger line of ag which has been attributed to electron - correlation effects .",
    "correlations may be significant also for aps because of the _ direct _ interaction of the two additional valence electrons in the final state .",
    "this is demonstrated by the cini - sawatzky theory : @xcite within the framework of the single - band hubbard model , the two - particle ( aps / aes ) excitation spectrum is dominated by a pronounced satellite feature which is split off the band - like part by a characteristic energy of the order of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath1 . for",
    "more realistic ( multi - band ) hubbard models the _ direct _ correlations give rise to very complex satellite structures .",
    "@xcite    a second shortcoming of the lander model consists in the fact that transition - matrix elements are not taken into account .",
    "modern theories for aps ( aes ) based on density - functional theory and the local - density approximation ( lda ) have overcome this deficiency .",
    "@xcite although the direct correlations are still neglected in these approaches , it seems that the ap spectra of fe and ni , for example , are well understood @xcite  serious indications for correlation effects have not been observed .",
    "this is surprising since it is well known that the _ auger _ line shape of ni can not be explained within an effective independent - electron model .",

    "@xcite    clearly , the question what really determines the appearance - potential line shape of transition metals , can only be answered _ a posteriori _  namely by comparison with a theory that realistically includes electron - correlation as well as matrix - element effects , orbital degeneracy and @xmath5-@xmath3 hybridization from the very beginning .",

    "spin - resolved spectra from excitation of the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) core level are recorded for different temperatures ranging from @xmath9  k up to and slightly above the ni curie point @xmath10  k. @xcite the theoretical interpretation of the line shape is essentially based on a multi - band hubbard - type model with general on - site coulomb interaction and a realistic parameterization of the ( lda ) one - particle electronic structure as an input for a subsequent many - body calculation .",
    "standard diagrammatic techniques are used to account for correlations .",
    "the transition - matrix elements are calculated within the usual intra - atomic approximation .",
    "the novel feature of the approach is that it allows to study _ separately _ the dos effect ( bare self - convolution ) , the temperature - dependent effect of the ( direct and remaining indirect ) correlations as well as the effect of the transition - matrix elements .",
    "experiments are performed for a ni(110 ) single - crystal surface with in - plane magnetization .",
    "@xcite the spin - polarized electron beam used for excitation is emitted from a gaas photocathode irradiated by circularly polarized light .",
    "the longitudinal spin polarization of the emitted photoelectrons is changed into transversal by @xmath11 electrostatic deflection . to correct for the incomplete polarization of the electrons ( @xmath12 ) ,",
    "all data have been rescaled to a @xmath13 hypothetical beam polarization and alignment between the electron - polarization and the sample - magnetization vector . in the present setup",
    "the core - hole decay is detected via soft - x - ray emission ( sxaps ) .",

    "@xcite opposed to photoemission spectroscopy , this comparatively simple tight - binding parameterization appears to be sufficient in the case of aps since the two - particle spectrum does not crucially depend on the details of the one - particle dos .",
    "the on - site interaction among the @xmath6 electrons is described by the second term @xmath78 .",

    "@xcite interactions involving delocalized @xmath25 and @xmath50 states are assumed to be sufficiently accounted for within the lda . for the @xmath3 states ,",
    "however , there is the well - known double - counting problem : the interactions are counted twice , once in @xmath76 ( i.  e.  on a mean - field level ) and once more in @xmath78 .",
    "to avoid this double counting , a third term @xmath82 has been introduced by which the hartree - fock part of @xmath78 is subtracted .",
    "@xcite    the hamiltonian @xmath83 constitutes an involved many - body problem . due to the low density of @xmath6 holes in the case of ni",

    "@xcite for finite hole densities the ladder approximation gives the two - particle green function @xmath84 as a functional of the one - particle green function ( `` direct correlations '' ) .",
    "the one - particle green function of the type @xmath85 corresponds to the ( inverse ) photoemission spectrum which itself is renormalized by @xmath78 ( `` indirect correlations '' ) .",

    "@xcite a resummation of higher - order diagrams is important to describe bound states ( `` ni 6 ev satellite '' ) @xcite which , however , are relevant for aes only .",
    "the numerical values for the direct and exchange interaction , @xmath87  ev and @xmath88  ev , are taken from ref .   where they have been fitted to the ground - state magnetic properties of ni . since",
    "spin - wave excitations are neglected in the approach , the calculated curie temperature @xmath89  k is about a factor 2.6 too high compared with the experiment . using reduced temperatures @xmath90 ,",
    "however , the temperature trend of the magnetization is well reproduced .",
    "the solid lines in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] ( left ) show the spectra as calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) using the ladder approximation . to account for apparatus broadening ,",
    "the results have been convoluted with a gaussian of width @xmath91  ev ( see ref .   ) .",
    "the calculated data are shifted by 852.3  ev such that onset of the unbroadened spectrum for @xmath20 coincides with the maximum of @xmath17 emission in the experiment ( dotted line ) .",
    "what are the signatures of electron correlations ? to estimate first the effect of the _ direct _ interaction between the two additional final - state electrons , fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( right ) also displays the results of the self - convolution model for comparison ( still including matrix elements as well as the fully interacting one - particle dos ) .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] and also a more detailed inspection show that the secondary peak at @xmath26  ev is not affected by correlations at all .",
    "this is consistent with observed temperature independence of the peak and with the fact that the dos has mainly @xmath25-@xmath50 character at the discontinuity deriving from the @xmath27 critical point .",
    "the maximum of the secondary peak is therefore used as a reference to normalize the measured spectra for each @xmath24 .",
    "looking at the results of the ladder approximation , the overall agreement with the measurements is rather satisfying . except for the lowest temperature the intensity , the spin splitting and the spin asymmetry of the main peak are well reproduced and , consistent with the experiment , a negligibly small intensity asymmetry and spin splitting is predicted for the secondary peak .",
    "switching off the direct correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , right ) results in a strong overestimation of the main peak structure . within the cini - sawatzky theory",
    "this has a plausible qualitative explanation : for low hole density the main effect of the direct correlations is known to transfer spectral weight to lower energies inaccessible to aps .",
    "this weight shows up again in the auger spectrum .",
    "recall that in fact a considerable weight transfer is seen in aes @xcite and that hypothetically for @xmath92 all weight would be taken by a satellite split off at the lower boundary of the auger spectrum .",
    "@xcite    the _ indirect _ correlations manifest themselves as a renormalization of the one - particle dos .",
    "thus , in first place they are responsible for the correct temperature dependence of the intensity asymmetry of the main peak in the ap spectrum .",
    "in particular , the indirect correlations result in a narrowing of the dos , which near the fermi energy @xmath93 is given by the ( almost spin independent ) quasi - particle weight @xmath94 , and in an intrinsic lifetime broadening @xmath95 .",
    "for @xmath96 the latter turns out to be smaller than @xmath97  ev for @xmath98  ev .",
    "@xcite the discrepancy between experiment and theory for @xmath99 is possibly due to an underestimation of @xmath100 within the sopt : with decreasing @xmath24 the increase of the exchange splitting leads to the appearance of a strong peak just above @xmath93 in the minority dos .",
    "a larger lifetime broadening of this peak would imply a less pronounced feature in the differential ap spectrum  mainly in the minority channel .",
    "setting @xmath101 for @xmath102 or @xmath103 , respectively , ( see below ) and comparing with the results of the full theory , demonstrates the importance of the transition - matrix elements . their energy dependence ( via @xmath104 )",
    "is weak over a few ev at energies of the order of kev and can not explain the difference between ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme ] .",
    "the main difference is rather a consequence of the fact that the radial @xmath19 core wave function has a stronger overlap with the ( more localized ) @xmath6 as compared to the ( more delocalized ) @xmath105 radial wave functions .",
    "this implies a suppression of the @xmath25-@xmath50 contributions to the orbital sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) as already found by ebert and popescu .",
    "@xcite the features above @xmath106  ev originate from additional discontinuities of the @xmath25-@xmath50-like dos ( as for the peak at @xmath26  ev ) .    for @xmath107",
    "the spin asymmetry of the spectrum is mainly due to the spin dependence of the green function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) . if the calculation of the matrix elements ( [ eq : tme ] ) starts from the _ spin - polarized _",
    "l(s)da potential , an additional spin asymmetry is observed resulting from the spin dependence of the states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tme ] ) .",
    "this , however , is small and has practically no influence on the results .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : tme ] shows a strong suppression of the intensity asymmetry at high energies when taking matrix elements into account .",
    "this effect is controlled by the symmetry of the matrix @xmath108 . in the antisymmetric case ,",
    "@xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , there is a maximum spin asymmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tme ] ) while , even for a ferromagnet , there is no spin asymmetry at all for the symmetric case .",
    "the results of the full calculation along eq .",
    "( [ eq : tme ] ) are neither fully symmetric nor antisymmetric with respect to @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "in conclusion , the ap line shape of a typical ferromagnetic @xmath6 transition metal results from a rather complex interplay of different factors . the present study has shown that a quantitative theoretical analysis of the temperature- and spin - dependent spectrum must be based on three ingredients at least :    \\(i ) `` indirect '' correlations : a realistic hubbard - type model including @xmath25-@xmath50 like states is a proper starting point to describe the magnetism and the temperature - dependent renormalization of the one - particle dos .",
    "\\(ii ) `` direct '' correlations : while @xmath25-@xmath50 derived features at higher energies appear to be sensitive to the geometrical structure only , the main peak is strongly affected by the direct interaction between the two additional final - state electrons .",
    "consistent with the cini - sawatzky model , the dominant effect is a considerable spectral - weight transfer to energies below the threshold .",
    "\\(iii ) matrix elements : spin - resolved aps can not be described theoretically without calculating orbital - dependent matrix elements .",
    "the spin asymmetry is mainly determined by their transformation behavior under exchange of the orbital quantum numbers @xmath113 .",
    "an open question concerns the importance of core - hole effects in aps .",
    "future work shall be concerned with the scattering at the core - hole potential in the final state and shall include the edge effects @xcite known from the studies of simple metals . a generalized ladder approximation including the valence - core interaction has been proposed in ref .  .",
    "previous work @xcite has shown that one should not expect the effects due the scattering at the core - hole potential to be strong for the case of ni .",
    "however , core - hole effects will become more important for systems with a smaller @xmath6 occupancy . for co and fe",
    "one also expects stronger effects of @xmath3-@xmath3 correlations .",
    "this work has shown that these @xmath3-@xmath3 correlations can not be neglected even for a system with low @xmath3-hole density such as ni and that de - convolution techniques to extract the unoccupied local dos have to be questioned seriously .",
