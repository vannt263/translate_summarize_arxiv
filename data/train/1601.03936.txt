    "quantum coherence is considered to be one of the most important resources in quantum physics .",
    "it has many significant applications in various subjects , such as quantum optics @xcite , quantum information @xcite , quantum biology @xcite , and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , a general criterion to quantify the coherence of quantum states in information theoretic terms has only been proposed recently @xcite , although the topic has ever been attempted in early papers @xcite .",
    "the general criterion has triggered the community s great interest @xcite , and based on the criterion , various concrete measures of coherence have been given .",
    "the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence , which satisfy the general criterion of quantifying the coherence of quantum states , were first suggested as two coherence measures based on distance in ref.@xcite . the coherence measure based on skew information @xcite , and the coherence measure based on entanglement @xcite",
    "were then proposed .",
    "more expressions were subsequently shown to fulfill the general criterion of quantifying coherence , such as the coherence of formation , the distillable coherence , and the coherence cost @xcite .",
    "there have been several different expressions of coherence measures , as mentioned above .",
    "however , these different expressions , which are based on various physical contexts , result in different values of coherence for a state in general . in this situation",
    ", an interesting question is whether these coherence measures give the same ordering of states .",
    "that is , for two coherence measures @xmath1 and @xmath2 , does @xmath3 imply @xmath4 for any two states @xmath5 and @xmath6 ?",
    "as two effective measures of coherence , one may expect @xmath1 and @xmath2 to give the same ordering for all the states even if numerical values of them are not quantitatively equal . in the paper",
    ", we address this issue .",
    "our discussions focus on the two well - known coherence measures , the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence , which have been widely used as a tool to investigate various aspects of coherence , such as the freezing phenomena of quantum coherence @xcite , the complementarity relations for coherence measures @xcite , and the cohering and decohering power of quantum channels @xcite .",
    "we will show that there are the states for which the two measures do not give the same ordering . as an extension of our analyses",
    ", we will also briefly discuss the other coherence measures , the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the coherence of formation as well as the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation , showing that they do not give the same ordering too .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we review some notions related to quantifying coherence and recall the three coherence measures under considered , i.e. , the @xmath0 norm of coherence , the relative entropy of coherence , and the coherence of formation . in sec . 3 , we present our main results , i.e. , we show that there are the states for which the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence do not give the same ordering , and also give examples to show that the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the coherence of formation , as well as the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation , do not give the same ordering too .",
    "4 is our conclusions .",
    "we review some notions related to quantifying coherence , such as incoherent states and incoherent operations , and recall the three coherence measures , the @xmath0 norm of coherence , the relative entropy of coherence , and the coherence of formation .",
    "let @xmath7 be the hilbert space for a @xmath8-dimensional quantum system .",
    "a particular basis of @xmath7 is denoted as @xmath9 , which is chosen according to the physical problem under discussion .",
    "coherence of a state is then measured based on the basis chosen @xcite .",
    "a state is called an incoherent state if and only if its density operator is diagonal in the basis , and the set of all the incoherent states is usually denoted as @xmath10 . therefore , a density operator @xmath11 is of the form @xmath12 .",
    "all other states , which can not be written as diagonal matrices in the basis , are called coherent states .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath13 to represent a general state , a coherent state or an incoherent state , and use @xmath14 specially to denote an incoherent state .",
    "a completely positive trace preserving map , @xmath15 , is said to be an incoherent completely positive trace preserving ( icptp ) map , or an incoherent operation , if the kraus operators @xmath16 satisfy not only @xmath17 but also @xmath18 , i.e. , each @xmath16 maps an incoherent state to an incoherent state .",
    "a functional @xmath19 can be taken as a measure of coherence if it satisfies the four postulates @xcite : + ( c1 ) @xmath20 , and @xmath21 if and only if @xmath22 ; + ( c2 ) @xmath23 for all icptp maps @xmath24 ; + ( c3 ) @xmath25 for all @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath18 ; + ( c4 ) @xmath28 for any set of states @xmath29 and any @xmath30 with @xmath31 . + postulate ( c1 ) imposes coherence measures to be a non - negative functional .",
    "( c2 ) and ( c3 ) show the monotonicity of coherence measures under incoherent operations and that under selective incoherent operations .",
    "( c4 ) means that coherence measures are nonincreasing under mixing of states .",
    "it is obvious that ( c3 ) and ( c4 ) imply ( c2 ) .",
    "these four postulates comprise a general criterion of defining a coherence measure .    in accordance with the general criterion ,",
    "several coherence measures have been put forward . out of them , there are the @xmath0 norm of coherence , the relative entropy of coherence , and the coherence of formation , which are considered in this paper .",
    "the @xmath0 norm of coherence is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 are entries of @xmath13 . the coherence measure defined by the @xmath0 norm",
    "is based on the minimal distances of @xmath13 to the set of incoherent states @xmath10 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the @xmath0 norm , @xmath36 .",
    "the upper bound is attained for the maximally coherent state @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy of coherence is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the quantum relative entropy , @xmath40 is the von neumann entropy , and @xmath41 is the diagonal part of @xmath13 .",
    "the coherence measure defined by the relative entropy is based on the minimal distances of @xmath13 to @xmath10 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the the relative entropy , @xmath42 .",
    "the coherence measure expressed by eq.([entropy ] ) can also be derived based on the notion of distillation process , i.e. , from the process that distills the maximally coherent states @xmath43 from @xmath13 under incoherent operations .",
    "it is the maximal rate at which the maximally coherent states can be obtained from the given state @xcite .",
    "the coherence of formation , is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is any decomposition of @xmath13 into pure states @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "expression ( [ cost ] ) , as the coherence of formation , was first given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was proved to be a coherence measure , i.e. , satisfying the four postulates , in ref .",
    "@xcite . the coherence measure expressed by eq.([cost ] ) can also be derived based on the notion of coherence cost , i.e. , from the process that prepares the state @xmath13 by consuming maximally coherent states @xmath43 under incoherent operations .",
    "it is the minimal rate at which the maximally coherent states have to be consumed to prepare the given state under incoherent operations @xcite .",
    "before proceeding further , we first specify the notion of ordering states with coherence measures . for a coherence measure @xmath19 , the coherence of a state , @xmath48 , is always a non - negative number , and therefore according to the numbers , all the states can be ranked in numerical order . for two coherence measures @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we say that they give the same ordering if the following relations are satisfied for all the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath49 otherwise , we say that they do not give the same ordering .",
    "relation ( [ order ] ) means that @xmath3 if and only if @xmath4 for all the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , or equally , @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 . similar notions of ordering states have been widely used in entanglement measures @xcite and other quantum - correlation measures @xcite .",
    "we will show that the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence do not give the same ordering of states , i.e. , there are the states for which the two measures give a different ordering . to this end , we need to find the states for which @xmath52 and @xmath53 , or @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the pair of states for which the two coherence measures give a different ordering as the ordering - different pair for convenience .",
    "we first consider @xmath56-dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the density operators of a @xmath56-dimensional system can be generally written as @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 can be further expressed as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is a diagonal and unitary matrix with @xmath65 .",
    "it means that @xmath59 and @xmath66 can be transformed into each other by an incoherent operation , which further implies that they correspond to the same coherence value for all the coherence measures due to postulate ( c2 ) .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider the family of density operators with the form @xmath66 .    by substituting eq .",
    "( [ rho2 ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ l ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) , we obtain the @xmath0 norm of coherence , @xmath67 and the relative entropy of coherence , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the binary shannon entropy function .",
    "@xmath70 is only dependent on @xmath71 , while @xmath72 is dependent on both @xmath71 and @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath72 is an even function of @xmath73 , we can further restrict our discussion to the range @xmath74 without loss of generality .",
    "specially , when @xmath13 is a pure state , there is @xmath75 due to @xmath76 . in this case",
    ", @xmath77 is an increasing function of @xmath71 just like @xmath78 , and therefore the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence always give the same ordering for all the @xmath56-dimensional pure states .",
    "there is no ordering - different pair in this case .    to find the ordering - different pairs for which the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence give a different ordering",
    ", we further analyze the expression of @xmath79 without the restriction of pure states . from eq .",
    "( [ crtz ] ) , we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 , which means @xmath79 is an increasing function of @xmath71 as well as @xmath73 .    with these knowledge , we may now try to find a pair of states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , such that the ordering of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are different from that of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for this",
    ", we let @xmath87 without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "the question then turns to find @xmath90 and @xmath91 such that @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath92 for a given pair of @xmath88 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) may not exist in general .",
    "for instance , at @xmath93 and @xmath94 , there do not exist @xmath90 and @xmath91 fulfilling eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) . since @xmath79 is an increasing function of @xmath71 and @xmath73 , the maximal value of the left side of eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) is appearing at @xmath95 , and the minimal value of the right side is appearing at @xmath96 .",
    "hence , we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 under which @xmath90 and @xmath91 exist .",
    "it means that @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfying the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) exist if and only if @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( @xmath100 ) satisfy the relation ( [ tcondition ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath91 satisfying @xmath101 . here , we have taken @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "all the pairs of states @xmath5 and @xmath6 defined by @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the domain for @xmath104 fulfill @xmath105 and @xmath53 .",
    ", width=317 ]    therefore , to find @xmath5 and @xmath6 that satisfy both @xmath105 and @xmath53 , one may first choose @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( @xmath106 ) with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ tcondition ] ) and then find @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath107 ) by using eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which satisfy eq.([tcondition ] ) , all the @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the domain with @xmath101 are given in fig .",
    "1 . clearly , there are infinitely many pairs of states satisfying @xmath108 .",
    "an explicit expression of @xmath5 and @xmath6 reads @xmath109 for which , @xmath110 but @xmath111 .",
    "+      we now consider high dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the above discussion is only on @xmath56-dimensional states .",
    "it shows that there are the pairs of states for which the @xmath0 norm and the relative entropy of coherence do not give the same ordering .",
    "this conclusion can be easily extended to the case of high dimensional density operators .",
    "in fact , any two @xmath112-dimensional states defined by @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are @xmath116-dimensional incoherent states , necessarily satisfy @xmath117 and @xmath118 as long as @xmath5 and @xmath6 do .",
    "this is because @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 .    it is worth noting that although the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence give the same ordering for all the @xmath56-dimensional pure states , it is not true for the @xmath122-dimensional case",
    "there are pairs of high dimensional pure states for which the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence do not give the same ordering .",
    "for example , in the @xmath123-dimensional case , @xmath124 is a pair of states for which the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence do not give the same ordering , since @xmath125 but @xmath126 . with the aid of the @xmath123-dimensional case",
    ", we can find pairs of higher dimensional pure states for which the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence do not give the same ordering . indeed , any pairs of @xmath127-dimensional pure states defined by @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 necessarily satisfy @xmath131 and @xmath132 as long as @xmath133 and @xmath134 do ( see the appendix for the proof ) .",
    "after having shown that the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence do not give the same ordering of states , we now extend our discussion to one more coherence measure , the coherence of formation . we wonder whether the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the coherence of formation , as well as the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation , give the same ordering of states .",
    "we will briefly discuss the issue in this subsection .",
    "in fact , with the aid of the above calculations , it is very easy to confirm that there are infinitely many ordering - different pairs for these coherence measures too .",
    "we first address the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the coherence of formation .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) and ( [ cost ] ) , we have @xmath135 for all pure states @xmath136 , which implies that all the pure states that satisfy @xmath137 and @xmath138 must fulfill @xmath137 and @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , all pairs of the @xmath123-dimensional states defined by eq .",
    "( [ psi12 ] ) and the @xmath127-dimensional states defined by eq .",
    "( [ lyt ] ) are the ordering - different pairs for the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the coherence of formation too . note that there is no ordering - different pair in the @xmath56-dimensional case , since both @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xcite are increasing functions of @xmath71 and therefore they give the same ordering for all the @xmath56-dimensional states .",
    "we now address the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation .",
    "since the coherence of formation and the @xmath0 norm of coherence give the same ordering for all the @xmath56-dimensional states as shown above , i.e. , @xmath142 if and only if @xmath52 , all the @xmath56-dimensional states that satisfy @xmath105 and @xmath53 must fulfill @xmath143 and @xmath53 . therefore , all the @xmath56-dimensional ordering - different pairs for @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the ordering - different pairs for @xmath146 and @xmath145 too .",
    "as pointed out in the case of the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence , there are infinitely many such pairs of states , and one may obtain them with the aid of eqs .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) and ( [ tcondition ] ) .",
    "an explicit expression of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is given in eq .",
    "( [ ccl ] ) , for which @xmath147 and @xmath111 .    besides",
    ", just like the result that any two entanglement measures coinciding on pure states are either identical or give a different ordering @xcite , we can also obtain a similar result for coherence measures .",
    "let us consider two coherence measures @xmath1 and @xmath2 that coincide on all pure states .",
    "note that for any state @xmath13 and any sufficiently small @xmath148 , there must exist pure states @xmath149 and @xmath150 such that @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 give the same ordering on all states , we have @xmath152 .",
    "as @xmath1 and @xmath2 coincide on pure states , we get @xmath153 , which further leads to @xmath154 . taking @xmath155 to zero ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath156 , which implies that any two coherence measures that coincide on pure states are either identical or give a different ordering .",
    "this result can be used to determine whether some coherence measures , for instance @xmath145 and @xmath146 , give the same ordering .",
    "however , it is not applicable to many other coherence measures , for example @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which do not coincide on pure states .",
    "the issue of ordering states with coherence measures is first discussed in this paper .",
    "we have shown that the two well - known coherence measures , the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence , do not give the same ordering of states .",
    "there are infinitely many ordering - different pairs for which the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence give a different ordering .",
    "detailed calculations show that the ordering - different states include the @xmath56-dimensional mixed states , the @xmath157-dimensional mixed states and the @xmath157-dimensional pure states , but exclude 2-dimensional pure states since all the coherence measures give the same ordering for 2-dimensional pure states .",
    "our analysis can be extended to other coherence measures , and as an illustration of the extension we have shown that the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the formation of coherence , as well as the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation , do not give the same ordering too .",
    "our results indicate that at least each pair of the three coherence measures , the @xmath0 norm of coherence , the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation , give a different ordering of states , although it remains an open question to examine whether all other coherence measures give a different ordering of states .    noting that any two states in an ordering - different pair can not be transformed into each other by incoherent operations",
    ", our result may be helpful in determining what kinds of states can not be transformed into each other by incoherent operations .",
    "we show that any two @xmath127-dimensional pure states defined by eq .",
    "( [ lyt ] ) necessarily satisfy @xmath131 and @xmath132 as long as @xmath158 and @xmath159 do . to this end , we only need to prove the following theorem : if the two @xmath160-dimensional states expressed as @xmath161 satisfy @xmath162 and @xmath163 , then the two @xmath8-dimensional states defined by @xmath164 with @xmath165 and @xmath166 , satisfy @xmath131 and @xmath132 .        by the definition of the relative entropy of coherence , we have @xmath172 and @xmath173 where @xmath69 is the binary shannon entropy function , and similarly , @xmath174 and @xmath175 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : crphid-3 ] ) and ( [ al ] ) show that @xmath132 if @xmath176 .",

    "<S> the quantification of quantum coherence has attracted a growing attention , and based on various physical contexts , several coherence measures have been put forward . an interesting question is whether these coherence measures give the same ordering when they are used to quantify the coherence of quantum states . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the two well - known coherence measures , the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence , to show that there are the states for which the two measures give a different ordering . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis can be extended to other coherence measures , and as an illustration of the extension we further consider the formation of coherence to show that the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the formation of coherence , as well as the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation , do not give the same ordering too . </S>"
