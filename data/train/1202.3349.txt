    "extracting such values directly from the simulations is quite challenging , as the density , velocity and length scales within the simulated galactic haloes range over many orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the length scale @xmath139 on which the magnetic energy density increases first within the main halo is determined by the size of star forming regions , which ( within the main halo ) can be associated to substructures .",
    "such substructures ( clumps of gas , stars and dark matter ) can be identified using subfind @xcite .",
    "only the largest substructures still contain gas and form stars within the main halo , having masses of @xmath140 and thereby diameters of a few @xmath136 kpc .",

    "note , that for higher resolutions , star formation sets in at higher redshifts leading to an earlier rise of collapsed , cooled gas and feedback and hence an earlier starting point for the turbulent dynamo . nevertheless , the saturation value of the magnetic field strength is indistinguishable .    for the calculation of the hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers ,",
    "the typical velocity @xmath17 and length scale @xmath18 are determined by the physical properties of the system , i.e. the soundspeed @xmath147 and the alfvnspeed @xmath148 , and the size of the halo , respectively , which do not depend on resolution .",

    "in this paper the evolution of magnetic fields during galactic halo formation is discussed .",
    "the main focus is placed on the investigation of the processes responsible for the amplification of magnetic fields from seed field levels to observed values .",
    "an analytical model for the evolution of the magnetic field driven by a turbulent dynamo is presented and the predictions of this model are compared with numerical , cosmological simulations of milky - way like galactic halo formation including the evolution of magnetic fields , radiative cooling and star formation .",
    "the most important results are summarized as follows :    * a primordial magnetic seed field of low strength can be amplified up to equipartition with other energy densities during the formation and virialization of a galactic halo in a @xmath3cdm universe .",
    "the final magnetic field strength decreases with a slope of @xmath110 -1.0 from @xmath6 g in the center to @xmath7 g behind the virial radius ( igm ) of the halo and also reaches @xmath149 g in interacting systems .",
    "these values are in notably good agreement with observations @xcite . *",
    "the magnetic field amplification in filaments and protohaloes is dominated by turbulent dynamo action .",
    "radiative cooling of the primordial gas is needed in order to reach spatial scales small enough for the turbulent dynamo to operate efficiently .",
    "equipartition is reached on small scales first and later on larger scales , consistent with theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "the turbulence is driven by the gravitational collaps , by supernova activity and by mergers of protohaloes into the main galactic halo .",
    "after equipartition is reached , the magnetic energy decays with a power - law dependance of @xmath150 .",
    "the igm magnetic field is amplified by outflows of magnetized gas from the center of the haloes and by merger - driven shock amplification outside the main halo . *",
    "the amplification timescale ( @xmath13-folding time ) of the order of @xmath151 yr is small enough to describe the generation of strong magnetic fields in irregular galaxies at high redshifts as observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the structure of the resulting magnetic field is random and turbulent .",
    "additional dynamo processes , e.g. the @xmath11-@xmath12 dynamo @xcite or the cosmic - ray - driven dynamo @xcite are needed to produce regularity in the magnetic field topology . *",
    "last , but not least , a basic analytical model is able to reconstruct the numerical results very accurately .",
    "weak magnetic perturbations grow in a non - stationary turbulent hydrodynamical flow .",
    "this amplification is slightly modified by the @xmath3cdm cosmology , particularly in the early universe .",
    "non - ideal truncation of the growth rate finally yields equipartition .",
    "these processes result in an analytical growth function which fits the simulations astonishingly well .    in the current picture of galaxy formation  together with cooling and star formation ",
    "magnetic fields are efficiently amplified from seed field levels up to the observed values .",
