    "present cosmological and astrophysical observations clearly depict a universe dominated by `` dark '' components , being it made by dark matter for @xmath0 and by dark energy for @xmath1 , while ordinary baryonic matter contributes for only the remaining @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "dark matter has a long history , being `` introduced '' by @xcite : for solving the problems of high mass - to - light ratios of galaxy clusters and of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "later on , several versions of the the so - called cold dark matter model ( cdm ) have been built starting from the assumption that a large amount of non - baryonic matter , matter non - interacting with the electromagnetic radiation but only detectable by its gravitational interaction with visible matter , could account for the observations in the framework of the standard newtonian dynamics .",
    "but even if its clustering and distribution properties are fairly well known at every scale ( see @xcite for the most used model ) , its nature is unknown , up to now , at a fundamental level .",
    "dark energy has a more recent history : it was `` introduced '' about ten years ago while reconstructing the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) observations , from which it was deduced that the universe is now accelerating @xcite . while growing the quantity of available cosmological data ( measurements of cluster properties as the mass , the correlation function and the evolution with redshift of their abundance @xcite ; the already mentioned hubble diagram of sneia ; the optical surveys of large scale structure @xcite ; the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background @xcite ; the cosmic shear measured from weak lensing surveys @xcite and the lyman-@xmath3 forest absorption @xcite ) , more evidences towards a spatially flat universe with a subcritical matter content and undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion have been collected .",
    "+ despite of the existence of universe acceleration has been clearly undisclosed , the nature and the fundamental properties of the underneath physical mechanism remain essentially unknown notwithstanding the great theoretical efforts made up to now . by _ simply _ adding a constant to the dynamical equations of universe , the cosmological constant @xmath4 @xcite , in the context of cdm model , it was defined a new model , the @xmath4cdm , which quickly became the _ consensus model _ because it provides a good fit to most of the data @xcite giving a reliable snapshot of the today observed universe .",
    "nevertheless , it is affected by serious theoretical shortcomings that have motivated the search for more general and alternative candidates generically referred to as dark energy .",
    "such models range from scalar fields rolling down self interaction potentials to phantom fields , from phenomenological unified models of dark energy and dark matter to alternative gravity theories @xcite .    in the last three decades",
    ", scalar fields have played an important role in both cosmology and particle physics @xcite .",
    "scalar fields have been postulated as means to explain the early and late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "however , it is almost always the case that such fields interact with standard matter : either due to a direct lagrangian coupling or indirectly through a coupling to the ricci scalar or as the result of quantum loop corrections .",
    "both for inflation in the early universe and for dark energy , such couplings can lead to problems . in inflation , for example , couplings might destroy the flatness of the potential needed to drive a period of inflation . if there are scalar fields which permeate the universe today and have non - zero couplings to matter , then they would induce an additional force in nature .",
    "if the scalar field self - interactions are negligible , then the experimental bounds on such a field are very strong : either the couplings to matter are much smaller than gravity , or the scalar fields are very heavy , so that they mediate a short - ranged interaction .    a certain class of theories have been proposed , in which the scalar field properties depend on the environment : its mass depends on the local environmental density .",
    "these are the so called _ chameleon field theories _ , proposed by @xcite , that employs a combination of self - interaction and couplings to matter of the scalar field to avoid the most restrictive of the current gravity bounds . in these models a scalar field couples to matter with gravitational strength , in harmony with general expectations from string theory , whilst , at the same time , remaining relatively light on cosmological scales .",
    "it was found that local gravity constraints are ( roughly ) satisfied as long as the mass - scale of the potential satisfies @xmath5 .",
    "this coincides with the scale associated with the late time acceleration of the universe , and it is surprising that it should come from local experiments .",
    "chameleon models have been subject to many studies , from laboratory experiments up to cosmological probes @xcite .",
    "lately , chameleons models where also studied in the context of modified gravity , in particular the so called @xmath6-gravity @xcite . in such a case , good results of general relativity , according to the standard probes , are reproduced at local scales while dark energy ( accelerating behavior ) and dark matter ( dynamical clustering ) effects are reproduced at larger scales .",
    "the major issue is to select suitable @xmath6-models capable of matching the density profiles at the various gravitational scales , as discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "chameleon fields evade tight gravity constraints via the so called chameleon mechanism : it consists on a field - generated force , a sort of _ fifth force _ , to become short - ranged in highly dense regions , and long - ranged in low density regions .",
    "such feature would imply that at different astrophysical scales the fifth force felt by matter would be suppressed or enhanced according to the local astrophysical density .    in this work",
    "we investigate whether there is evidence for a coupling between baryonic matter and a massive scalar field which could mimic and replace the contributions of a possible dark matter component .",
    "in particular , motivated by chameleon models , we aim to verify if it is possible to observationally detect a scalar field whose mass ( or , equivalently , interaction length ) and coupling may change with scale , matching different astrophysical observations . in this case , by astrophysical observations , we mean data from sneia , low surface brightness ( lsb ) dwarf galaxies and , finally , clusters of galaxies . the range of scales is very wide and we are adopting photometric and spectroscopic data to probe the mechanism at different redshifts .",
    "+ we want to stress here that we are just interested to investigate whether the data would favor a model where baryons may be coupled to a scalar field whose mass and coupling change with scale .",
    "if such a change is due to a chameleon mechanism ( associated to a local - density variation ) or due to some other mechanism , that is not the main concern in this article and so we will not compute specific predictions for any particular model .",
    "chameleon models are highly non linear so that , in principle , no superposition principle for such a non - linear field would be possible . due to that , it is extremely difficult to build the gravitational potential of an extended astrophysical system as the ones we analyse in this work .",
    "fortunately , we are not specifically investigating chameleon models ; we are here studying a general coupled scalar field model and asking the data what are the preferred values of its mass and coupling at different scales . in order to compute an extended gravitational potential ( in a non - linear case as the chameleon model would be ) , we would need to properly study the non - linear regime of structure formation within this type of models .",
    "but this is well beyond the scope of this article . in spite of being of utmost importance to set up n - body simulations with heavy scalar field models ,",
    "such task is extremely complex .",
    "in fact up to nowadays most of the n - body simulations assume light scalar fields which do not cluster at small scales .",
    "that is obviously not the case of chameleon fields and such investigation is not considered in the present paper .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in   ( [ sec : scalar_theory ] ) we give a brief but exhaustive summary of all the main properties of the scalar field theory . in   ( [ sec : obs_data ] ) we accurately describe the used astrophysical and cosmological data and the theoretical model defined for any of them . in ",
    "( [ sec : results ] ) we expose our results with a discussion on their implications for a more general and comprehensive theory of gravity .",
    "conclusions are drawn in   ( [ sec : conclusions ] )",
    "a general action governing the dynamics of the chameleon ( scalar ) field @xmath7 can be of the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the determinant of the metric @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the ricci scalar , @xmath12 are the various matter fields and @xmath13 is the lagrangian density of ordinary matter .",
    "+ in the expression for the reduced planck mass , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the bare gravitational constant and differs from the usually measured one . +",
    "this can be better understood if we consider the most general case of a scalar - tensor model , whose action ( eq .",
    "[ eq : action_cham ] is a particular case of this ) is @xcite : @xmath16 @xmath6-gravity models too can be enclosed in this general case since it is straightforward to show that , by suitable manipulations , they are a subclass of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scal - tens - action ] ) ; see for example @xcite . from this action",
    "one can naively define newton s gravitational constant as : @xmath17 but @xmath18 has not the same physical meaning as newton s gravitational constant in general relativity .",
    "the actual newtonian force measured in a cavendish - type experiment between two test masses will experience an effective coupling constant @xmath19 where the term @xmath20 is due to the ( average ) exchange of gravitons between the two bodies , while @xmath21 comes from the exchange of a scalar particle between them , with the analytical expression for @xmath3 depending on the particular scalar theory one considers .",
    "it is also clear from this expression , that what in general relativity is a _ true _",
    "constant , now becomes a possible function of time and radius , so the use of the term _  constant \" _ is quite inappropriate .",
    "when we will speak about a _",
    "varying gravitational constant _ we always refer to the effective scalar field gravitational constant expression .",
    "the key ingredient in studying the cosmological dynamics of a field , when it supports a chameleon mechanism , is that the scalar field feels both a potential , @xmath22 , and a coupling to matter depending on @xmath23 , the local density of matter , and on the coupling constant , @xmath24 . at the end the field dynamics is governed by an effective potential , @xmath25 if @xmath22 is a run - away potential and @xmath26 , the effective potential has a minimum at @xmath27 satisfying the condition : @xmath28 and the effective mass of the field of small perturbations about the minimum is @xmath29 so the effective potential depends on the matter density and both the minimum in potential and the mass of the scalar field are function of the local density , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cham_pot ] ) . as density increases , the minimum in potential shifts to smaller values of the field and the mass of small fluctuations increases .",
    "this last property , in particular , makes the chameleon field able to satisfy the constraints from laboratory tests of the principle of equivalence , because in high densities environment , such as terrestrial laboratories , the field can be heavy enough so to evade them .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that even with such a mechanism , it is very difficult to build a theory with a late time cosmology observationally indistinguishable from the standard @xmath4cdm model .",
    "another interesting consequence of this model comes out when considering linear perturbations of matter and their related equation . in the most general case of a scalar - tensor theory",
    "@xcite we have : @xmath30 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the scale factor , @xmath32 is the hubble function , @xmath33 is the matter density contrast and , if the field is at the minimum , its mass is @xmath34 .",
    "the quantity in brackets can be interpreted as the expression for the effective gravitational constant within the context of massive scalar field models @xcite : @xmath35 in particular the term proportional to @xmath36 results from the scalar field - mediated force , which is negligible if the physical length scale of the perturbation is much larger than the range of the chameleon - mediated force , namely , if @xmath37 . in this case the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert_eq ] ) is well approximated by @xmath38 and the matter fluctuations grow as in general relativity .",
    "anyway chameleon theories ( i.e. based on eq .  [ eq : v_cham ] ) do not behave like linear theories ( as anticipated in the introductory section ) of massive scalar fields when massive bodies are involved .",
    "varying the action eq .",
    "( [ eq : action_cham ] ) with respect to the chameleon ( scalar ) field @xmath7 in a spherically symmetric spacetime gives : @xmath39 because of the effective potential for @xmath7 changes in different density environments , this differential equation is highly non - linear .",
    "these non - linear features have been studied in @xcite , where it was found that for a spherically symmetric object of mass @xmath40 and radius @xmath41 surrounded by a gas of asymptotic density @xmath42 , the profile of the field is governed by the so - called `` thin - shell '' parameter , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the minima of the effective potential outside and inside the object respectively and @xmath46 is the newtonian potential at the surface of the object .",
    "thus @xmath47 is the ratio of the difference in @xmath7 potential to the newtonian potential and quantifies how perturbing the object is for the @xmath7 field .",
    "if @xmath47 is large , which happens for small objects , then the external ( to the object ) profile of @xmath7 is the usual yukawa profile , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass of the scalar field . for large and compact objects",
    ", @xmath47 is small and the yukawa profile is suppressed by a factor of @xmath47 . thus the term `` thin - shell '' comes from the fact that only a portion of such a `` thin - shell '' contributes to the external yukawa profile .",
    "a discussion of this issue in the framework of @xmath6-gravity is in @xcite .",
    "+ in summary the main ingredients of our model are :    * a massive scalar field coupled with ordinary observable baryonic mass ; * its mass @xmath50 , or its interaction length @xmath51 ; * its coupling constant with baryonic mass @xmath24      taking the inverse fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_cham ] ) it is straightforward to obtain the corresponding expression of the gravitational potential for a point mass distribution , @xmath52 . remembering that a potential @xmath53 in real space yields a @xmath54 term in fourier space , we can recognize in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_cham ] ) the point - like gravitational potential per unit mass : @xmath55 where @xmath50 is the mass of the scalar field , @xmath51 is the interaction range of the modified gravitational potential , i.e. the length where the scalar field is effective , and @xmath24 still being the coupling constant between matter and the scalar field . the gravitational potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grav_pot_point ] ) is a point - like one , so that we have to generalize it to extended systems if we want to use it for clusters of galaxies and lsb galaxies .",
    "as we will discuss later , we are going to model galaxy clusters as spherically symmetric systems : we simply consider the system composed by many infinitesimal mass elements each one contributing with a point - like gravitational potential . then , summing up all terms , namely integrating them on a spherical volume , we obtain a suitable potential .",
    "specifically , we have to solve the integral : @xmath56 we make explicit that with an abuse of notation we are writing inside the point - like potential @xmath57 , while it should be replaced by @xmath58 .",
    "the point - like potential can be split in two terms .",
    "newtonian _ component is : @xmath59 and its extended integral is the well - known expression : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass enclosed in a sphere with radius @xmath62 .",
    "the _ correction _",
    "term coming from the scalar field is : @xmath63 from the integration of the angular part , we have : @xmath64 the radial integral is numerically estimated once the mass density is given .",
    "a fundamental difference between such a term and the newtonian one is that while in the latter the matter outside the spherical shell of radius @xmath62 does not contribute to the potential , in the former external matter takes part to the integration procedure , even if its contribution is really negligible in most cases .",
    "+ at the end , the total potential of the spherical mass distribution will be : @xmath65",
    "as we will show below , for our purpose we need the gravitational potential derivative with respect to the variable @xmath62 ; this may not be evaluated analytically so we estimate it numerically , once we have given an expression for the mass density @xmath66 . while the newtonian term gives the simple expression : @xmath67 the derivative of the corrective potential term is more involved .",
    "we do not give it explicitly for sake of brevity , but only remind that it is an integral - function of the form @xmath68 from it one has : @xmath69 such an expression is numerically derived once the integration extremes are given .",
    "+ for spiral galaxies , we have the same theoretical apparatus but a different geometric configuration .",
    "matter in spiral galaxies is generally modeled as distributed in a thin axis - symmetric disk , so that the extended gravitational potential is given by : @xmath70 even in this case , for being more exact , the couple of variables @xmath71 inside the point - like potential should be replaced by @xmath72 .",
    "once the gravitational potential is given , the rotation curve for the disk can be easily computed starting from the relation @xcite : @xmath73    it is important to underline that both in the clusters of galaxies case and in the lsb galaxies one , we have to perform derivatives with respect of the distance from the center of any system , @xmath62 , of the numerically derived gravitational potential . to be completely rigorous",
    "we should add a term to all the previously written relations , coming from the derivative of the _ function _ @xmath74 .",
    "in our scalar - field approach we have treated the coupling parameter as a _ constant _ at all , while in the definition of the chameleon mechanism it is also possible and not trivial that it may depend on the local density of the gravitational system one is going to consider . at the same time , we do not know what is the possible analytical behavior of this quantity or , better : it is one of our purposes trying to reconstruct it .",
    "it is also evident that if we want to use previous relations in the form we have shown before , we are implicitly assuming that @xmath24 can satisfy two different scenarios : _",
    "a. _ it is really constant , and in this case one expects not to detect any change in it when comparing different gravitational scales ; or ( as we will shown to be our case ) _",
    "b. _ it is a function of the gravitational scale , but its derivative is supposed to be negligible , i.e. @xmath75 .      in @xcite the friedmann equation is derived from the action governing the dynamics of the chameleon field @xmath7 in the jordan frame : @xmath76 with contribution from matter , radiation and the scalar field . making explicit the expression for the planck mass , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried_cham ] ) becomes : @xmath77 \\ ; .\\ ] ] we can show that this equation in the chameleon case easily converts in the most general expression for a given scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "+ if we assume the chameleon field @xmath7 is in the minimum of the effective potential from the early stages of the universe on , then we have @xmath78 @xcite during the subsequent evolution until today .",
    "this also means that @xmath79 to very high accuracy so it will disappear from equations and does not have to be considered here .",
    "then , considering that the function @xmath80 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geff_gf ] ) is equal to unity in the scalar field case , we also have @xmath81 . at the end",
    "the friedmann equation is completely equal to the usual expression : @xmath82,\\ ] ] and finally , avoiding radiation contribution while suffix @xmath83 corresponds to the scalar field : @xmath84 where : @xmath85 the function @xmath86 is unknown ; but one knows ( assumes ) that the scalar field works like a cosmological constant on cosmological scales , so we may choose it to be constant in redshift or one can use more general and extended models as the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite usually used to _ phenomenologically _ describe dark energy fluids .",
    "even if we do not have any possibility to discriminate between @xmath4cdm and a scalar field scenario only by using @xmath87 , we have a discriminating tool in the distance modulus , the main observable quantity derivable from sneia observations , modified from the usual expression by assuming that the gravitational constant can vary with time : @xmath88 in this expression there is an additional term made of with the ratio between the value of effective gravitational constant at any redshift and the same quantity evaluated at the present ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "as accurately described in @xcite , a time - varying gravitational constant can affect light curves from sneia by changing both the thermonuclear energy release , since the luminosity at the maximum in the light curve is proportional to the mass of synthesized nickel , and the time scale of stellar explosion .",
    "this means that by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mod_dist_cham ] ) we are going to test the scalar field mechanism on cosmological scales , in particular considering the consequent role of a possible variation of the effective gravitational constant in the universe acceleration rate history . in the scalar field theory one has an analytical expression for the effective gravitational constant , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq : g_cham ] ) , which we have modified in the following one for uniforming all the results : @xmath90 which depends on the following variables :    * the redshift @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) ; * the wavelength @xmath93 ( or the length @xmath94 ) , which one could fix or vary on a grid ; * the intrinsic model parameters , i.e. , the coupling constant @xmath24 and the interaction length @xmath95 , which can be constrained with a fitting procedure .",
    "we are going to test the scalar field mechanism on three different scale ranges :    * on cosmological scales , by means of supernovae luminosity distance ; * on a mpc - astrophysical scale , using mass profiles of clusters of galaxies ; * on a kpc - astrophysical scale , analyzing rotation curves from spiral galaxies .",
    "for any of them , we have found out the necessary sample data in literature .",
    "sneia are useful because of the possibility to easily modify the expression of distance modulus for more general theories with a varying gravitational constant ( as in the scalar field case ) . moreover , the distance modulus is the main observable quantity derivable from this kind of astrophysical objects . adding to that ,",
    "the possibility of using data ranging up to redshift values much larger than those ones from galaxies or clusters of galaxies ( @xmath96 ) makes us possible to test and verify a possible temporal variation of the gravitational constant ( if there is any ) and so a possible alternative gravity scenario .",
    "it is interesting to underline that with the modified expression of the distance modulus we can also verify the coexistence , at the same time , of both _ dark energy _ and _ dark matter _",
    ", both explained as different consequences on different scales of the same unified context , namely , the scalar field .",
    "in fact , in the expression for the distance modulus we are going to describe in next sections , we employ both a term with a _ dark energy - modeled fluid _ , coming out nothing else that from the effective behavior of the scalar field on cosmological scales ( which does not differ much from the cosmological constant behavior ) and a term acting as a _ dark matter - modeled component _ , coming out from the scalar field working on gravitational scales smaller than the cosmological one . in this sense , we have also explored how the scalar field process can mimic dark matter profiles in clusters and spiral galaxies .",
    "we use the _ constitution _ sample described in @xcite , which is a data set obtained by combining the union data set by @xcite with new @xmath97 nearby objects from the cfa3 release described in @xcite .",

    "this means that , in this region , the gas is not in hydrostatic equilibrium but in a multi - phase state . in this case , the gas temperature can not be used as a good standard tracer . among the main phenomena which causes this we have cooling flows , merger effects and asymmetric shapes .",
    "in particular , cooling flows produce a decrease in the temperature profile and consequently local higher gas densities which can not be related directly to gravitational effects . +",
    "a coherent behavior is shown in our plots , fig .",
    "( [ fig : cham_cl1 ] )  -  ( [ fig : cham_cl2 ] ) .",
    "we remind that there the distribution of dark matter is represented ; higher densities from cooling flows produce higher non - gravitational - produced gas mass profiles , which result in a decrease of the dark matter one . in our case",
    ", we have that our theoretical dark matter profile ( i.e. the _ effective _ dark matter mimicked by the different coupling of scalar field with baryonic mass ) is higher than the observationally derived one ( see for example abell 262 , abell 383 , abell 478 , abell 1413 , abell 1991 , abell 2029 ; while for abell a133 and abell 1795 one can perceive the same trend but unfortunately the data do not extend too small enough radii ) .",
    "+ however , a more detailed modelling for inner regions is out the purpose of this work , while we are here interested to show that the scalar field mechanism can be a valid alternative to dark matter in order to explain cluster dynamics . in this sense",
    "it is very illuminating that on the most part of objects in our sample there is a very good agreement between the scalar field model and the observationally derived dark matter profiles on a wide range of distances from the centers for any cluster , approximately in the interval @xmath432 $ ] kpc , or at least up to the maximum radii coming from observations .    giving a more detailed glance to the absolute values of scalar field parameters for clusters",

    "mkw4 and rxj1159 are recognized as the strongest outliers in temperature profile , exhibiting very compact cooling regions and having a temperature peak smaller than other sample objects and located in inner region at @xmath437 kpc .",
    "rxj1159 is better classified as an x - ray over - luminous elliptical galaxy ; optically , this object appears as a nearly isolated elliptical galaxy but its x - ray luminosity and extent is typical of poor clusters .",
    "mkw4 is considered a group of galaxies or a poor cluster @xcite too , so we have to consider them as different object from the rest of the sample",
    ". moreover we can not give any conclusion about this gravitational class ( group of galaxies ) because only one object has no statistical weight for any analysis .",
    "+ always in @xcite , the cluster abell 2390 seems to elude typical clusters scaling relations ; this is due to its unusual central cool region , which extends up to @xmath438 kpc , probably because the cold gas is pushed out from the center by radio lobes .    from these considerations , it is interesting to note that just these three objects result having the most different values for the coupling constant @xmath24 with respect of the other clusters and even seem to exhibit a peculiar trend .",
    "mkw4 ( and rxj1159 ) have more compact inner cool regions and this is associated with : @xmath439 higher values for @xmath24 , which means a larger coupling of scalar field with ordinary matter ( @xmath24 acts like a concentration parameter ) and @xmath440 smaller value for the gravitational length . on the contrary ,",
    "abell 2390 shows a larger cooling region , which corresponds to : @xmath439 smaller values for @xmath24 and @xmath440 larger for @xmath264 .",
    "we underline that in our approach it is very important to find these kind of correlations : if we want to make the scalar field mechanism the most general and basic possible , we need to find any possible link among its parameters and the physical properties of our analyzed gravitational systems , so being able to perform forecasts for other scaling properties and to recognize that a scalar field is acting even when it is not directly possible to derive easy quantities to be compared with data .                going on in this search , we have plotted the scalar field length @xmath264 versus the virial radius of any cluster ( bottom panel in fig .",

    "even if the two lengths result very different , with the scalar field parameter @xmath264 always smaller than the virial radius , we have a phenomenological relation between them ( we have performed a weighted linear fit which results better than any higher order polynomial ) , @xmath443 from it one can see that the scalar field length scales as @xmath444 , so that it may possible to find a relation between scalar field parameters and the virial ( navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) model based ) ones .",
    "+ we have also checked a possible relation between @xmath264 and the mean temperature @xmath330 ( top panel in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cluster_ltvirr ] ) ) , with the final result : @xmath445 this last results is again very intriguing , because for clusters of galaxies we have a mass - temperature relation @xcite , @xmath446 where @xmath47 is the overdensity level relative to the critical density at the cluster redshift , so that @xmath447",
    ". then we have to consider that for most of our clusters the redshift is very small so that the ratio @xmath448 is almost equal to @xmath449 .",
    "we remind that : @xmath450 so we can deduce that our scalar field length follows perfectly the mass - temperature relation , being @xmath451 and that any scatter in the previous relation can be attributed to differences in clusters redshifts .    finally , we plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cluster_t_profiles ] ) the scaled temperature profiles versus the distance from the center of any clusters scaled with respect of the scalar field length @xmath264 obtained by fit .",
    "it is extremely interesting and not obvious that the profiles are all re - scaled and self - similar as it happens in the usual approach .",
    "we can even say something more : in the scalar field approach we can see that some properties which are depicted in fig .",
    "( 16 ) of @xcite , as for example the different profiles among subgroups of clusters with mean temperature in different ranges ( less than @xmath452 kev , between @xmath452 and @xmath453 kev and greater than @xmath454 kev ) with distances rescaled with respect of @xmath135 , here disappear .",
    "in fact , all the clusters form an homogeneous gravitational family ( the only exception being abell 2390 , as discussed before ) .",
    "we could say that the scalar field length @xmath264 contains more fundamental information than the virial radius .      taking into account lsb galaxies we have one parameter more than the clusters case : together with the intrinsic scalar field parameters we have the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath234 , which we need for the conversion from the stellar surface photometry to the stellar mass density . in principle",
    "this parameter could be left free ; but we have decided to put a prior on it derived from literature . in @xcite",
    "they investigate star formation history and chemical evolution of lsb galaxies by modeling their observed spectro - photometric and chemical properties using a galactic chemical and photometric evolution model incorporating a detailed metallicity dependent set of stellar input data .",
    "results show that @xmath234 for this class of galaxies has usually values between @xmath455 and @xmath456 . for this reason we have constrained the mass - to - light ratio to the interval @xmath457 $ ] as a conservative hypothesis , and only in one case ( ugc3851 ) we had to enlarge the interval up to @xmath458 .",
    "+ an important assumption about this parameter is that we assume it being constant over the whole range of data ; this is an unavoidable and the most general assumption one can do without having details of stellar population distribution inside lsb galaxies .",
    "a comment is in order for a correct evaluation of the results : during the analysis we have compared the theoretical rotation curves coming out from our scalar field model using only the observable - matter densities described in @xcite with data firstly published in @xcite .",
    "these data , available in the simbad data base , consist of the contributions to the total rotation curve coming from the stellar component ( with an assumed mass - to - light ratio @xmath242 ) and the gas one ( with gas density normalized with a factor @xmath236 for taking into account helium contribution ) , together with the total observed rotation curve ( which can be considered an effect of dark matter in a cdm scenario or coming out from the interaction with a scalar field as in our approach ) .",
    "both the total and the gas rotation curve have been submitted to a smoothing procedure for deleting irregularities mainly coming from two different elements .",
    "first , the assumption that has been made when deriving mass models from rotation curves is that there is symmetry , that all mass in on circular orbits and that there is continuity with radius .",
    "raw data show scatter and non - circular motions which can produce virtual or ambiguous rotation velocities .",
    "second , gas densities often show small - scale structures , irregularities and look clumpy at any distance from the center , and this can give possible large fluctuations in the rotation curve . in @xcite",
    "the smoothing procedure is tested of course , and the smooth rotation curve is a very good approximation to the raw rotation curve . but some discrepancies with our theoretical estimations can be find because of we have used raw gas density profiles from @xcite . + if we consider that all gas contributions to rotation curve are multiplied to @xmath24 only , while the star ones to the combination @xmath459 , in some cases , depending on the fit values and on their contribution , irregularities in the gas distribution are emphasized and may affect the total rotation curve profile .",

    "<S> we investigate whether there are any cosmological evidences for a scalar field with a mass and coupling to matter which change accordingly to the properties of the astrophysical system it `` lives in '' , without directly focusing on the underlying mechanism that drives the scalar field scale - dependent - properties . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a yukawa type of coupling between the field and matter and also that the scalar field mass grows with density , in order to overcome all gravity constraints within the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse three different gravitational systems assumed as `` cosmological indicators '' : supernovae type ia , low surface brightness spiral galaxies and clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> results show that : _ </S>",
    "<S> a. _ a quite good fit to the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies only using visible stellar and gas mass components is obtained ; _ </S>",
    "<S> b. _ a scalar field can fairly well reproduce the matter profile in clusters of galaxies , estimated by x - ray observations and without the need of any additional dark matter ; _ c. _ there is an intrinsic difficulty in extracting information about the possibility of a scale - dependent massive scalar field ( or more generally about a varying gravitational constant ) from supernovae type ia . </S>"
