    "groups of galaxies are weak enhancements in the projected galaxy distribution .",
    "velocity information from redshift surveys confirms , however , that they are indeed true spatial density enhancements ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; ramella , geller & huchra 1989 ; ramella , pisani & geller 1997 ) , although probably still far from equilibrium ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; moore , frenk & white 1993 ; @xcite ) .",
    "groups probe the intermediate scale between galaxies and clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) and can provide important constraints on the amount of dark matter , on the formation and evolution of galaxies , and on the properties of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further information about the dynamics of structure formation come from anisotropies of the correlation function in redshift space , which are related to moments of the pairwise velocity distribution .",
    "the first moment @xmath7 enters the time evolution equation for the spatial correlation function , and has so far been estimated directly only for the iras 1.2 jy survey ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "considerably more attention has been devoted to the second moment @xmath8 , which measures the random motions of galaxies and can be used to constrain @xmath6 via the cosmic virial theorem ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have shown that @xmath8 is sensitive to the presence of clusters within a survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and so requires a large survey volume to obtain a robust and unbiased estimate ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; somerville et al .",
    "1997a ; @xcite ) .",
    "many early estimates of @xmath8 were substantially below the values predicted by the popular cdm model and its variants ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "larger values were found by mo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , by marzke et al .",

    "( 1998 ) for the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , hereafter ) .",
    "the latter results are for the largest two surveys currently available and suggest that the large velocity bias previously advocated to reconcile cdm models with observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) may be unnecessary .",
    "comparing the observed distribution of galaxies with models of structure formation is problematic . in particular ,",
    "if only the dark matter evolution is simulated directly , as is usually the case , then some method must be found to specify the positions , velocities and luminosities of galaxies before `` mock '' redshift surveys can be constructed for direct comparison with real data ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "this approach enables us to simulate the physical processes relevant to galaxy formation , evolution and clustering , and to explore different assumptions about processes , like star formation and feedback , which occur on scales below the resolution limit of our @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "standard semi - analytic models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) use press - schechter theory ( @xcite ) and its extensions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to compute the merging history of dark matter halos . within these halos , simple prescriptions , based on observational data and on more detailed simulations , regulate gas cooling rates , star formation rates , stellar population evolution and feedback from stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "dynamical friction considerations determine the merging rate among galaxies within a common halo , and so the competition between the formation of spheroids by merging and the formation of disks through cooling of diffuse gas .",
    "such models do not , however , provide detailed information about the clustering and the motions of galaxies .    in our approach ( see paper i ) ,",
    "dark matter halos and their evolution through collapse , accretion and merging are followed directly in the @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "other processes are then followed as in standard semi - analytic models .",
    "diffuse halo gas is assumed to cool and collect in a disk at the centre of each halo .",
    "stars form in such disks according to simple , observationally motivated laws .",
    "the central galaxy is identified with the most bound particle in the halo .",
    "when two or more halos merge , the properties of the central galaxy of the most massive progenitor are transferred to the most bound particle of the remnant .",
    "other galaxies from the progenitors become `` satellites '' .",
    "these can merge with the central galaxy of the new halo on a time - scale which is related to their progenitor mass as expected from numerical experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy properties such as luminosity , colour , stellar and gas mass , star formation rate and morphology evolve according to recipes borrowed from earlier semi - analytic work .",
    "we are thus able to analyse clustering as a function of galaxy properties and of redshift ( paper i ; @xcite , paper ii hereafter ) .",
    "we investigate two variants of a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe : the @xmath2cdm model , with cosmological density parameter @xmath1 , shape parameter @xmath15 and hubble constant @xmath16 km s@xmath14 mpc @xmath14 , and the @xmath5cdm model , with @xmath3 , cosmological constant @xmath4 and @xmath17 km s@xmath14 mpc @xmath14 .",
    "as discussed in paper i , in order to obtain an approximate match between models and observations , supernova feedback must be very efficient in the @xmath2cdm model , expelling large amounts of the reheated gas and so suppressing the formation of galaxies in low - mass field halos .",
    "on the other hand , feedback must be inefficient in the @xmath5cdm models and most reheated gas must be retained in order to produce a sufficient number of luminous galaxies .",
    "paper i compared the properties of galaxies in our two models with a variety of present - day observational data , among these the luminosity function in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands , the colour distribution , the two - point correlation function , the pairwise velocity dispersion , and the mass - to - light ratios of clusters .",
    "the free parameters which control star - formation and feedback in these models were set by fitting the i - band tully - fisher relation of @xcite and the mean gas content of a spiral galaxy at a circular velocity of 220 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this `` normalisation '' choice resulted in fiducial models where certain other properties , in particular the luminosity functions , are a relatively poor fit to observation .",
    "nevertheless , we used these fiducial models in a follow - up study of the evolution of clustering to high redshift ( paper ii ) and , for consistency , we will continue to use them below , even though it turns out that setting parameters to optimise the luminosity functions gives better fits to the abundance of groups in magnitude - limited redshift surveys .    here",
    "we extract wide - angle mock surveys from the simulations in order to perform a more detailed analysis of small - scale galaxy clustering .",
    "we compare our models with the northern region of the center for astrophysics redshift survey ( cfa2n hereafter ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cfa2n covers a volume comparable to the volume of our simulation box .",
    "moreover , it provides the largest published catalogue of galaxy groups .",
    "we compare the properties of groups in the cfa2n with those of groups extracted from a variety of mock catalogues .",
    "in addition , we compare the redshift space correlation functions and the pairwise velocity dispersions of the real and artificial redshift surveys .    because our predicted luminosity functions are sensitive to variations of model parameters within their plausible range , it is important to analyse small - scale clustering in ways that are insensitive to the exact luminosities assigned to galaxies . to gain more insight into this question ,",
    "we compare results for our fiducial models with results from mock surveys of models in which galaxy luminosities are adjusted to reproduce the cfa luminosity function exactly .",
    "( the luminosity _ ranking _ of the simulated galaxies is preserved during this adjustment . ) only the abundance of groups and the fraction of galaxies in groups are strongly affected by this change . even when the cfa luminosity function is reproduced exactly , some differences in small - scale clustering remain between @xmath5cdm and @xmath2cdm , and between both and the cfa2n .",
    "such differences may thus provide additional constraints on models .",
    "our work is the first attempt to compare a wide - angle redshift survey with simulations where the physics of the formation and evolution of individual galaxies is treated explicitly .",
    "previous work has compared the cfa redshift space correlations and group properties with @xmath0-body simulations either by assigning galaxies to dark matter particles according to some high - peak statistical model , or by assigning them to halos based on an assumed halo mass - to - light ratio ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some recent studies have attempted to simulate galaxy formation in detail but have been forced either to treat volumes which are too small to obtain reliable clustering statistics ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) or to use a resolution which is too poor to follow the formation and evolution of individual galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our approach ,",
    "the physical processes important in galaxy formation are treated in a simplified way , but are included _",
    "ab initio _ and are followed throughout the evolution of our models .",
    "quantities such as the galaxy luminosity function are thus predictions of our scheme , rather than being imposed as part of the modelling . in paper",

    "the most bound particle in each halo is taken as its centre , and we calculate a radius @xmath22 within which the average mass density is 200 times the critical density .",
    "a 3d group of galaxies is then defined as a set of three or more galaxies brighter than some chosen absolute magnitude which lie within @xmath22 of a particular halo centre .",
    "groups in the real universe are identified in redshift surveys .",
    "below , we will compile mock surveys from our simulations and catalogue groups identified in redshift space .",
    "we will then be able to address two issues : ( 1 ) how well the physical properties of redshift space groups correspond to those of 3d groups ; ( 2 ) how well the simulation groups reproduce the properties of groups in the real universe .    in this section , we describe the physical properties of the 3d groups .",

    "as discussed in paper i , our decision to normalise the models to the i - band tully - fisher relation results in both models producing too many bright galaxies .",

    "less massive halos ( @xmath30 , thin solid and dotted lines ) contribute mainly to the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "bright galaxies come from large halos ( @xmath31 , long - dashed and short - dashed lines ) .",
    "note that these halos show a slight bump in the luminosity function at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , similar to the bump in the luminosity function of several real clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) including coma ( @xcite ) . in the models , this effect originates from the large merger cross - section of the bright and massive central galaxies which tend preferentially to accrete galaxies of somewhat lower mass .",
    "dynamical studies of groups and clusters have always produced mass - to - light ratios @xmath34 which are substantially smaller than that needed globally to close the universe ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is not clear that the galaxy populations in groups are representative of the universe as a whole ( see paper i ) .",
    "in addition , if galaxies are more strongly clustered than the dark matter , multiplying the mean luminosity density by the typical @xmath34 for groups and clusters can give a highly biased estimate of @xmath6 . indeed , previous work analysing mock surveys drawn from simulations has suggested that high and low density universes produce group catalogues which are not only almost indistinguishable in their observational properties , but also quite similar to the cfa groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; nolthenius , klypin & primack 1997 ) . to investigate the distribution of galaxies relative to dark matter in rich clusters , figs .",
    "[ fig : den_bias ] and [ fig : vel_bias ] compare profiles of density contrast and velocity dispersion for the dark matter and for galaxies of differing luminosity and colour in halos with @xmath35 . in order to compute average profiles for the whole halo sample ,",
    "we normalise the positions and the velocities of galaxies and dark matter particles to the halo virial radius @xmath22 and to the circular velocity @xmath36 at @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we then compute the average profile by superposing all the halos in our sample and giving equal weight to each galaxy .",
    "note that each halo contains a galaxy at its centre .",
    "if we keep these central galaxies when computing the average profile , every halo would contribute a galaxy ; we would thus obtain a galaxy number overdensity profile several times larger than the dark matter profile at radii @xmath37 , only because of our arbitrary choice of placing a galaxy at the centre of each dark matter halo . in real clusters , this might not be the case .",
    "therefore , we exclude these central galaxies when computing the profiles .",
    "this exclusion has no effect at the radii @xmath38 plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : den_bias ] and [ fig : vel_bias ] .    the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : den_bias ] shows mean number overdensity profiles @xmath39 for the dark matter and for galaxy samples split by luminosity and by colour .",
    "the lower part gives the bias @xmath40 , the ratio between the galaxy and the dark matter overdensities .",
    "in most cases the galaxies are less concentrated than the dark matter , resulting in @xmath40 values less than 1 outside the cluster core .",
    "there is no strong dependence of bias on luminosity but there is a variation with colour .",
    "we divide galaxies into a red and a blue sample at the median of the colour distribution .",
    "red galaxies are more clustered than blue ones , in agreement with the observed morphology - density relation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "blue galaxies are strongly anti - biased ( @xmath41 ) in the @xmath5cdm model , showing relatively little concentration towards the centres of these rich clusters .",
    "this is a result of our assumption that galaxies lose their gaseous halos , and so their reservoir of new gas , when they fall into a cluster .",
    "they then redden as their interstellar medium is used up and their star formation rate drops .",
    "the effect is much weaker in @xmath2cdm because infall of galaxies continues at a high rate until @xmath42 in this model .",
    "notice that the number density profiles for the total galaxy population have identical shapes in the two models but are offset in normalisation by about a factor of 3 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with observed number density profiles @xmath43 derived from the cnoc cluster sample ( @xcite ) and the eso nearby abell cluster survey , enacs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to obtain surface density profiles from the models , we assume spherical symmetry and integrate the three - dimensional profiles along a line of sight . at radii @xmath44 , where the number surface density reaches the background value , we approximate the three - dimensional galaxy number density profile with a @xcite profile .",
    "in fact , at these radii , galaxies follow the dark matter distribution closely ( figure [ fig : den_bias ] ) .",
    "the absolute normalisations are difficult to establish from the observational data .",
    "we therefore focus on profile shapes and on the relative distribution of galaxies with different properties .",
    "in fact , the observational surveys find different concentrations between red and blue galaxies ( cnoc ) , and between emission - line and non - emission - line galaxies ( enacs ) .    in fig .",

    "the non - emission - line and emission - line subsamples contain @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the galaxies , respectively .",
    "we split our simulated galaxy samples into red and blue subsamples in such a way as to reproduce these fractions .",
    "we normalize both the observed and the model profiles at @xmath48 . for the enacs sample , we assume @xmath49 mpc , the mean value of @xmath22 for the clusters in both our @xmath2cdm and @xmath5cdm models .",
    "these surveys give mean profile shapes very similar to those we find here .",
    "in addition , the differences between the observed subsamples are intermediate in strength between those predicted by our two models .",
    "note however that the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : surfden ] are only indicative , because the relative distribution of galaxy subsamples is sensitive to the selection criteria .",
    "for example , when the spectra are used to split the enacs sample into early - type non - emission - line and late - type emission - line galaxies , the difference widens ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : vel_bias ] shows , for our models , the velocity dispersion ( in units of the circular velocity @xmath36 ) for galaxies within spheres of radius @xmath50 ( in units of @xmath22 ) .",
    "these dispersions depend very little on the luminosity of the galaxies and are very similar to the dark matter dispersions .",
    "there is a noticeable colour effect , however , which is quite large in the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the red galaxies trace those of the dark matter , whereas blue galaxies have dispersions a factor @xmath51 larger .",
    "a similar effect is seen in real clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ) ; it reflects the fact that the few observed blue galaxies have just fallen into the cluster and so are more weakly bound than the red galaxies .",
    "the weak velocity bias we find for most galaxy samples is consistent with the similarity between the moments of the pairwise velocity distribution for the galaxies and for dark matter ( see paper i ) .",
    "table [ tab : gr_3d ] lists the quartiles of the distributions of a variety of 3d group properties .",
    "groups are here defined as halos which contain three or more galaxies brighter than @xmath52 within @xmath22 .",

    "they have slightly larger sizes , lower luminosities and larger velocity dispersions in @xmath5cdm ; these differences combine to give typical @xmath60 values which are two times _ larger _ in the low density model .",
    "this surprising result can be attributed primarily to the lower luminosity density in the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "if we multiply the median @xmath60 of the groups in each simulation by the mean luminosity density , we can estimate @xmath6 by dividing the result by the appropriate critical density .",
    "these estimates @xmath61 are given in the last line of table [ tab : gr_3d ] and in both cases are nearly a factor of 2 smaller than the actual value of @xmath6 .",
    "notice that @xmath56 actually overestimates the true group mass systematically .",
    "if we use the true median @xmath62 of groups to compute @xmath61 rather than our median virial estimate , we get 0.40 and 0.13 for @xmath2cdm and @xmath5cdm respectively . clearly , the standard assumption that groups have the same mass - to - light ratio value as the universe as a whole is untrue in either model .",

    "[ sec : lf ] we showed that the simulated luminosity functions agree rather poorly with the observations .",

    "furthermore , the cfa2n is significantly denser than the cfa survey as a whole , presumably because the `` great wall '' dominates this region .    in order to understand how the luminosity functions of our models affect the properties of the groups and the redshift space correlation functions we study below , we have constructed mock catalogues from our simulations in two different ways :    1 .",
    "we keep the luminosities of the galaxies predicted by the semi - analytic recipes ; we refer to catalogues made using these luminosities as semi - analytic luminosity function ( salf ) catalogues ; 2 .",
    "we alter the luminosities of the galaxies in the simulations in order to obtain an exact match to the cfa luminosity function .",
    "this is done as follows . for each model",
    "we select a set of luminosities from the cfa luminosity function constrained so that their number equals the number of simulation galaxies with original luminosity @xmath74 and their sum equals the simulated volume times the cfa luminosity density .",
    "the new luminosities then replace the original ones in such a way that the luminosity ranking of the galaxies is unaltered . for each galaxy",
    "we compute the shift from the original to the new luminosity .",

    "the accidental inclusion of interlopers is one of the major problems in identifying groups in redshift space .",

    "these figures show that @xmath53 depends only weakly on @xmath110 and is a decreasing function of @xmath116 ; for @xmath144 it depends little on either linking parameter . on the other hand",

    "this bias in group size is related to the rather high interloper fraction noted above . if interlopers are excluded when calculating group properties , then the remaining galaxies are , by definition , all members of the same halo and so give a measure of group size which is statistically similar to that found using full 3d information .",
    "we demonstrate this in tables [ tab : gr_rs_tcdm ] and [ tab : gr_rs_lcdm ] , which compare the weighted quartiles of the distributions in mock redshift surveys including and excluding interlopers with those of the 3d groups repeated from table [ tab : gr_3d ] . excluding interlopers has little effect on the velocity dispersions of the groups but brings their estimated sizes and mass - to - light ratios into much better agreement with those of the 3d groups",
    "unfortunately , of course , it is not possible to exclude interlopers from real redshift survey group catalogues in this fashion .",
    "it is curious that in our models this interloper - induced overestimation of @xmath53 in redshift survey groups combines with the overestimation of true group mass by @xmath56 ( see section [ sec:3d - dyn ] ) to almost exactly cancel out the factor of 2.5 difference between the true mass - to - light ratio of groups and the mean mass - to - light ratio of the universe . as a result ,",

    "it is difficult to judge whether this interloper - bias conspiracy will also work in the real universe .",
    "some of the tests we carry out below suggest that there is no reason to expect that these two biases should always be of the same order .",
    "in this section , we compare our groups with the cfa2n catalogue .",
    "the galaxy luminosity function is a fundamental ingredient in constructing mock catalogues and in the friends - of - friends algorithm , so we might expect properties of groups in our simulated redshift surveys to depend strongly on the adopted luminosity function .",

    "given the limitations of the observational and numerical data we consider in this paper , the agreement between theory and observation is remarkable and demonstrates that present day group dynamics alone give little information about @xmath6 .",
    "our preference for @xmath5cdm over @xmath2cdm is based on its better agreement with the observed luminosity functions and tully - fisher relations ( paper i ) and with the observed evolution of clustering ( paper ii ) rather than on any difference in pairwise velocities or in the mass - to - light values implied for groups . on the other hand ,",
    "these clustering differences reflect observable differences in the evolution of groups and clusters and of their galaxy populations which should be detectable in future surveys to higher redshift .",
    "we will investigate these issues more thoroughly in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the @xmath0-body simulations were carried out at the computer center of the max - planck society in garching and at the eppc in edinburgh , as part of the virgo consortium project .",
    "we thank margaret geller , john huchra and ron marzke for enabling us to compare the cfa2n data directly with these numerical data .",
    "we also thank margaret geller , massimo ramella and roberto trasarti - battistoni for several enlightening discussions and an anonymous referee for suggesting improvements in the presentation of our results . during this project , a.d . was",
