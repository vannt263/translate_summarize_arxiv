    "the systems of isotropic magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) and anisotropic chew - goldberger - low ( cgl ) plasma equations , in particular , their equilibrium reductions , are extensively used in physical applications , including the controlled thermonuclear fusion research , geophysics and astrophysics ( earth magnetosphere , star formation , solar activity ) and laboratory and industrial applications @xcite .",
    "mhd and cgl systems , as well as their equilibrium versions , are essentially nonlinear systems of partial differential equations , depending in general on three spatial coordinates @xmath0 .",
    "knowledge of physically meaningful exact solutions and analytical properties of these systems ( such as symmetries , conservation laws , stability criteria , etc . ) is of great importance for understanding the core properties of the underlying physical phenomena , for modeling , and for the development of appropriate numerical methods .",
    "common ways of finding exact analytical solutions to such systems include : ( 1 ) pde system reduction by a symmetry group ( self - similar or invariant solutions ) , ( 2 ) use of intrinsic symmetries of pdes to generate new solutions from known ones , and ( 3 ) use of transformations from solutions to other equations .",
    "the first approach has been successfully applied to the static mhd system in cases of axial and helical symmetry ( the well - known grad - shafranov @xcite and jfko @xcite equations ) , which resulted in several types of exact solutions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "a different approach that makes use of equilibrium solution topology ( general existence of 2d magnetic surfaces ) has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "a symmetry of a system of des is any transformation of its solution manifold into itself .",
    "a symmetry thus transforms any solution to another solution of the same system .",
    "point symmetries are obtained by the general algorithmic lie method of group analysis @xcite .",
    "it is equally applicable to algebraic and ordinary and partial differential equations . in a similar algorithmic manner , contact and lie - bcklund symmetries ( depending on derivatives )",
    "are found .",
    "closely connected is the potential symmetry method @xcite for discovering nonlocal symmetries , and the notion of nonlocally - related potential systems and subsystems @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that lie group analysis method is capable of detecting not only several - parameter , but also infinite - dimensional symmetry groups ( depending on an arbitrary functions , see e.g. @xcite . )    in this paper we perform lie group analysis and the comparison of point symmetries of static isotropic ( mhd ) and anisotropic ( cgl ) equations .",
    "though the lie procedure is straightforward and applicable to any ode / pde system with sufficiently smooth coefficients , it requires extensive algebraic manipulation and the solution of ( often large ) overdetermined systems of linear pdes . for many contemporary models , _ especially those that do possess non - trivial symmetry structure , _",
    "such analysis presents a significant computational challenge .",
    "for example , for static and dynamic mhd and cgl equilibrium systems , the determining equations for the lie point symmetries split into hundreds of linear equations .",
    "we note that the recent derivation of important infinite lie groups of symmetries of dynamic mhd @xcite and cgl @xcite equilibrium systems was done by special methods other than the lie algorithm - the group analysis for these systems has net been previously done due to computational difficulty .",
    "however later it was shown that lie algorithm indeed can detect those symmetries @xcite .",
    "modern analytical computation methods , based on grbner bases @xcite-@xcite and characteristic sets @xcite-@xcite , efficiently reduce large overdetermined systems of partial differential equations , and in many cases facilitate the complete or partial group analysis .",
    "( for a review , see @xcite . )",
    "one of the most powerful software packages for symmetry - related computations is a reduce - based set of programs by thomas wolf @xcite .",
    "it includes crack , liepde and conlawi routines for pde system reduction , search for symmetries , conservation laws and adjoint symmetries of de systems .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce a recently developed package ` gem ` for maple @xcite and use it for the complete lie group analysis of the static cgl and mhd systems .",
    "the package routines perform local ( lie , contact , lie - bcklund ) and nonlocal symmetry and conservation law analysis of ordinary and partial differential equations without human intervention ( section [ a_pack ] . ) corresponding determining systems are automatically generated and reduced , and in most cases completely solved .",
    "the routines employ a special symbolic representation of the system under consideration , which leads to the overall significant speedup of computations .",
    "this factor is of particular importance in the problems of _ symmetry / conservation law classification _ for systems with arbitrary constitutive function(s ) .",
    "the module routines can handle de systems of any order and number of equations , dependent and independent variables . to the best of the author s knowledge ,",
    "` gem ` is the most functional and fast end - user - oriented package for maple .",
    "the complete lie group analysis and comparison of symmetries of static cgl and mhd systems reveals that when the anisotropy factor is constant on magnetic field lines , the static cgl system possesses an _ infinite symmetry group _ , involving an arbitrary function constant on magnetic surfaces , similarly to the dynamical cgl equilibrium system ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . on the other hand , unlike its dynamic version @xcite , the static mhd system does not possess infinite symmetries , but only affords scalings , translations and rotations ( section [ subs_sym_clas ] . )",
    "the infinite symmetry group of the static cgl system deserves special attention .",
    "it depends on the solution topology , and reveals an alternative pde system representation that directly connects the static cgl system with the static mhd system , establishing a `` many - to - one , onto '' solution correspondence ( sections [ subs_sym_clas ] , [ subs_inf_prop ] . )",
    "the latter has important practical value .",
    "in particular , a direct way of construction of new cgl equilibria from known mhd ones follows . for new cgl solutions obtained from a given mhd one ,",
    "physical conditions and explicit stability criteria are preserved , which makes them suitable for exact physical modelling .",
    "we also demonstrate how axially and helically symmetric anisotropic static plasma equilibria can be constructed using the common form of grad - shafranov and jfko equations ( section [ subs_gs_cgl ] . )",
    "( we remark that the equation derived in @xcite and referred to by authors as `` the most general form of the nonrelativistic grad - shafranov equation describing anisotropic pressure effects '' is hardly usable , due to its complicated form , and no nontrivial solutions to it are known . )    in section [ subs_examp_vort ] , we present an example of the application of the derived infinite symmetry group to construction of a family of new exact static anisotropic ( cgl ) plasma equilibrium ( an `` anisotropic plasma vortex '' ) in 3d space from a known mhd equilibrium ( which is at the same time a cgl equilibrium ) .",
    "other types of exact static mhd solutions known in literature may be used to produce families of cgl plasma equilibria in the similar manner .",
    "further remarks are presented in section [ sec_further ] .",
    "the static mhd equilibrium system is obtained from the general mhd equations ( e.g. @xcite ) in the time - independent steady case @xmath2 and has the form @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the vector of the magnetic field induction ; @xmath5 , plasma density ; and @xmath6 , plasma pressure .",
    "the static time - independent equilibrium of anisotropic plasmas is a similar reduction of cgl equations @xcite @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the anisotropy factor , @xmath9 and the pressure @xmath10 is a tensor with two independent parameters @xmath11 .    the anisotropic equilibrium system ( [ eq_apee ] ) is closed with an equation of state @xcite @xmath12 which implies that the anisotropy factor @xmath8 is constant on magnetic field lines .",
    "other possible choices include , for instance , empiric relations ( see @xcite . ) ( we remark that the relation ( [ eq_tau_cond ] ) is compatible with dynamic equations of state , such as `` double - adiabatic '' equations suggested in the original cgl paper @xcite , since time derivatives identically vanish for all equilibria . )    it is known that in static mhd equilibria ( [ eq_pee ] ) , the magnetic field @xmath13 always lies on 2-dimensional magnetic surfaces that span the plasma domain .",
    "the only possible exception is beltrami - type configurations @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in a compact domain ,",
    "magnetic surfaces are generally tori @xcite .    in the general anisotropic equilibrium case ,",
    "2d magnetic surfaces are not necessarily present . however , as shown below , they always exist in static anisotropic plasma configurations ( [ eq_apee])-([eq_tau_cond ] ) .      for a general system of @xmath16 partial differential equations of order @xmath17 , @xmath18 the set of all solutions is a manifold @xmath19 in @xmath20 - dimensional space @xmath21 , which corresponds to a manifold @xmath22 in the prolonged ( jet ) space @xmath23 of dependent and independent variables together with partial derivatives @xcite .    in particular , for the systems ( [ eq_pee ] ) and ( [ eq_apee])-([eq_tau_cond ] ) , the independent variables are cartesian coordinates @xmath24 , and the dependent variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the lie method of seeking lie groups of transformations ( symmetries ) @xmath30 that map solutions of ( [ e21 ] ) into solutions consists in finding the lie algebra of vector fields @xmath31 tangent to the solution manifold @xmath22 in the jet space . here",
    "@xmath32 is a group parameter , or a vector of group parameters .",
    "here @xmath33 are the coordinates of the prolonged tangent vector field corresponding to the derivatives @xmath34 ; these are fully determined from ( @xmath35 ) by differential relations .",
    "thus tangent vector fields ( [ e23 ] ) are isomorphic to infinitesimal operators @xmath36    operators ( [ e26x ] ) are infinitesimal generators for the global lie transformation group ( [ e22 ] ) , which is reconstructed explicitly by solving the initial value problem @xmath37 @xmath38    to find all lie group generators ( [ e26x ] ) admissible by the original system ( [ e21 ] ) , one needs to solve linear determining equations @xmath39 on @xmath40 unknown functions @xmath35 that depend on @xmath40 variables @xmath41 .    the overdetermined system on @xmath35 is obtained from ( [ e28 ] ) using the fact that @xmath35 do not depend on derivatives @xmath42 .",
    "thus the system ( [ e28 ] ) splits into an @xmath43 linear partial differential equations . for static mhd ( cgl ) equilibria ,",
    "this leads to a system of 133 ( 253 ) linear pdes on 7 ( 8) unknown functions respectively .",
    "methods of solution of such overdetermined systems are discussed in the following subsection .",
    "tangent vector field components @xmath35 of the symmetry generator ( [ e23 ] ) may be allowed to depend on derivatives @xmath44 such symmetries are known as _ lie - bcklund symmetries _ @xcite . unlike lie symmetries",
    ", they act on the solution manifold @xmath45 in the infinite - dimensional space @xmath46 of all variables and derivatives . due to this fact",
    ", lie - bcklund symmetries can not be integrated to yield a global group representation similar to ( [ e22 ] ) , and can not be used to explicitly map solutions of differential equations into new solutions .      for a system of several pdes with several dependent and independent variables ,",
    "overdetermined systems resulting from determining equations can be large - consisting of dozens or hundreds of linear pdes .",
    "the simplification and integration of such systems , especially in the cases of nontrivial symmetry structure ( e.g. infinite symmetries ) , often presents a computational challenge .",
    "analytical computation software is traditionally used to produce and reduce large linear pde systems that arise .",
    "algorithms for reduction overdetermined systems based on grbner bases and characteristic sets techniques have been successfully implemented @xcite .",
    "however the author had difficulty finding an `` end - user '' package that does not require human intervention in computation , has sufficient functionality ( i.e. is capable of computing lie and lie - bcklund symmetries of arbitrary ode / pde systems of reasonable order , performing symmetry classification with respect to constitutive functions of the system , doing conservation law analysis , etc . ) in conceivable time .",
    "available general lie group analysis software packages , such as ` desolv ` by vu and carminati , partly have desired functionality , including no user intervention in symmetry computation and output in the form of a set of symmetry generators ( [ e23 ] ) ; however , for the systems with several spatial and dependent variables , such as static mhd equilibrium system ( [ eq_apee ] ) , the analysis can not be performed with usual computation resources in finite time ( though the lie symmetry group finite - dimensional ) .    a waterloo maple - based package ` gem ` ( `` general module '' ) has been recently developed by the author .",
    "the package routines are capable of finding all ( lie , contact and lie - bcklund ) local symmetries and prescribed classes of conservation laws for any ode / pde system without significant limitations on de order and number of variables , and without human intervention .",
    "the routines of the module allow the analysis of ode / pde systems containing arbitrary functions .",
    "_ classification _ and isolation of functions for which additional symmetries / conservation laws occur is automatically accomplished .",
    "such classification problems naturally occur in the analysis of de systems that involve constitutive functions .",
    "the symmetry classification may lead to the linearization , discovery of new conservation laws and symmetries in particular cases ( for example , see @xcite . )",
    "the `` gem '' package @xcite employs a special representation of the system under consideration and the determining equations : all dependent variables and derivatives are treated as maple _ symbols _ , rather than functions or expressions .",
    "this significantly speeds up the computation of the tangent vector field components corresponding to derivatives ( up to any order ) and the production of the ( overdetermined ) system of determining equations on the unknown tangent vector field coordinates .",
    "the latter is reduced by ` rif ` @xcite package routines ( which is also done faster with derivatives being symbols , rather than expressions . )",
    "the reduced system can , in most cases , be automatically and completely integrated by maple s internal ` pdsolve ` routine . however",
    "( in rare cases ) the routine is known to miss solutions , therefore it is recommended that the solution of the reduced determining system ( for symmetry or conservation law analysis ) is verified by hand in each case .",
    "we would like to underline that in the study or classification of symmetries and conservation laws , the most important and time - consuming task is indeed the simplification ( and in the case of a classification problem , the case - splitting ) of the overdetermined pde system of determining equations .",
    "this task is automatically done by ` gem ` routines .",
    "the consecutive task of solving the reduced system is in most cases much simpler , and usually can be done and verified by hand in reasonable time .",
    "a brief description of symmetry analysis procedure using the ` gem ` package is given in appendix a.",
    "in the current section we present the complete lie point symmetry classification of static mhd and cgl systems ( [ eq_pee ] ) , ( [ eq_apee])-([eq_tau_cond ] ) , and demonstrate that the static cgl system possesses an infinite - dimensional symmetry group ( depending on an arbitrary function ) , whereas the static cgl system does not .",
    "global transformation groups corresponding to the discovered symmetry generators are given .",
    "special attention is devoted to an infinite - dimensional symmetry group of the cgl static equilibrium system , that appears to be related to the infinite - dimensional symmetry group of dynamic cgl equilibrium system @xcite .",

    "the infinite symmetries of the static cgl system ( [ eq_apee])-([eq_tau_cond ] ) directly relate it to static mhd equations , which is important for applications .",
    "namely , it provides a way of construction of exact anisotropic plasma equilibria from known static mhd solutions , allow simple formulation of famous grad - shafranov and jfko equations for anisotropic plasmas , and more ( see section [ examp_sec ] . )",
