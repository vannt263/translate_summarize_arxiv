    "in recent years , the intense research activity around topological insulators @xcite has drawn increased attention to the influence of spin - orbit coupling in the solid state , and demonstrated that qualitatively new phases of band insulators can appear.@xcite in the limit of strong electron - electron interactions , spin - orbit coupling can also have a profound influence on the phase diagram of hamiltonians potentially relevant to correlated topological materials.@xcite in the context of correlated materials with strong spin - orbit coupling , transition metal oxides containing iridium atoms , known as iridates , have been a focus of research.@xcite in particular , unusual magnetic orders have been suggested in a number of iridates.@xcite due to the large cross - section for neutron absorption in iridium , neutron scattering experiments ( which can be used to determine magnetic order as well as the magnon spectra ) are especially challenging,@xcite and a variety of experimental techniques have been applied to study them.@xcite in particular , resonant x - ray scattering is a powerful probe of iridates.@xcite the magnetic model we study in this work is in part motivated by theoretical work on iridates .",
    "another area in which spin - orbit coupling has played a leading role is spintronics,@xcite where the coupling of spin and orbital motion allows for an electrical detection of spin properties .",
    "spintronic devices offer the possibility of low - power components of computing elements , and may also exhibit longer coherence times than conventional devices , which may prove useful for quantum architectures.@xcite in spin caloritronic devices the additional element of a thermal gradient is included and the relationship between thermal gradients , spin currents , and spin - orbit induced voltages is investigated.@xcite    in this work , we are interested in the thermal transport properties of a 2d strong spin - orbit driven magnetic insulator . in these systems , the thermal transport is dominated ( at low temperatures ) by magnetic and lattice excitations that carry heat .",
    "we study these systems using local moment models that are coupled to phonons ( lattice distortions ) through exchange constants that depend on the relative distance between nearby moments .",
    "the main role of the spin - orbit coupling is to induce unusual , and sometimes highly spatially anisotropic magnetic orders .",
    "the thermal transport is computed within the boltzmann approach ( in the relaxation time approximation ) which takes as inputs the magnon spectrum of the various magnetic orders , and the phonon spectrum of the underlying lattice . for concreteness , we focus on a well - known two - dimensional model , the so - called heisbenberg - kitaev ( hk ) model,@xcite on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the hk model has a rich , established magnetic phase diagram that provides a useful starting point for investigating the magnetic fluctuations within the @xmath0 expansion , where @xmath1 is the magnitude of the local moment.@xcite previous studies of thermal transport in insulating magnetic materials indicated that the magnetic and thermal contributions to the thermal conductivity can be comparable.@xcite our main result in this work is to show that the spatially anisotropic magnetic states that can arise from strong spin - orbit coupling can dramatically affect the thermal transport , or have a rather small effect depending on the relative size of magnon and phonon thermal conductivities .",
    "in some cases , the thermal transport may help identify the symmetries of the magnetically ordered state if other measurements are difficult or problematic .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec",
    ": magnon - phonon ] we introduce the local moment model we study , and describe how the phonons are incorporated into the exchange constants of the model . in sec.[sec : spin_waves ] the magnon spectrum for various ordered phases of the local moment model is computed , which will be used as an input for the thermal conductivity . in sec.[sec : mag_pho_relxtimes ] the magnon and phonon scattering rates are computed , and in sec.[sec : thermal_conductivity ] we present the results for the thermal conductivity in various regimes and for various phases of our model . finally , we present the main conclusions in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",

    "we focus on the ferromagnetic , nel , stripy , and zig - zag phases .",
    "the presence of the kitaev coupli - ngs additionally renders the low energy magnetic excitations of the various magnetically ordered phases spatially anisotropic , as a result of which the thermal conductivity , especially if it is magnon dominated , is generally expected to be different  along \" the stripe ( or zig - zag ) compared to the direction  perpendicular \" to it .",

    "one - phonon processes are more important than multiple phonon processes , and therefore we truncate the infinite expansion of eq . up to the @xmath50 term .",

    "[ fig : balisticfigxx ] and [ fig : balisticfigyy ] , the temperature region was chosen well below the magnetic transition as well as the debye temperature , since our system of study is assumed to have well - defined low energy magnetic degrees of freedom ( given by the heisenberg - kitaev hamiltonian ) as well as low energy magnetic excitations . for sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the use of the debye model in the calculation of the phononic thermal conductivity as well as the neglect of higher order processes ( magnon - magnon , phonon - phonon or magnon - phonon ) are all well justified .",
    "three distinct characteristic energy relative strengths are considered : ( i ) magnetic energy half the debye energy , ( ii ) magnetic energy equal to the debye energy , and ( iii ) magnetic energy twice the debye energy . in the application of eq . , the mean free path for the boundary scattering",
    "is taken as @xmath221 , i.e. approximately equal to the length of the crystal @xmath163 ( for simplicity we assume a square crystal ) . in this case , the magnonic and the phononic contribution to the @xmath222 thermal conductivity tensor depends solely on the respective carrier s band structure , via its energy dispersion relation , its group velocity , and its bose - einstein occupation factor .",
    "therefore , any differences among the total fully ballistic thermal conductivities directly reflect differences in the carrier band structures , and particularly differences in the magnon band structures , since the phonon band structure is common to all magnetically ordered phases .",
    "note that for the ferromagnetic and the nel phases there are two magnon bands , while for the zig - zag and the stripy phases there are four bands . in the low temperature region ,",
    "as far as the magnon contribution is concerned , any gapless magnon bands are more important than any gapped ones , and furthermore , the respective thermal conductivity contribution is dominated by the band structure nearby any magnon valleys .",
    "this is because the bose - einstein occupation factors decrease rapidly with increasing excitation energies .",
    "for a two - dimensional system , there is one longitudinal and one transverse acoustic phonon ( notice that in the fully ballistic regime studied in this section both acoustic phonons are taken into account ) , both assumed to obey a linear isotropic dispersion relation .",
    "particularly , the two acoustic phonons are treated within the debye model adjusted to a two dimensional system .",
    "it is worth noting that the phononic thermal conductivity within the debye model in the low temperature regime becomes @xmath223 for a 2d system ( in contrast to the @xmath224 result for a 3d system ) .",
    "taking into account the previous discussion we now turn our attention to the figs .",
    "[ fig : balisticfigxx ] and [ fig : balisticfigyy ] .",
    "the bottom diagram of each figure represents phonon dominated total thermal conductivity results .",
    "the curves for different phases tend to converge to each other as a result of the common phonon band structure , tend to follow a parabolic dependence on the temperature as a result of the debye model applied to 2d systems , and tend to become more isotropic due to the smaller difference between the values of the @xmath208 and @xmath209 components .",
    "the top diagram of each figure represents magnon dominated total thermal conductivity results that differ appreciably from each other over different magnetic phases as a result of the very different magnon band structures of the various phases , deviate significantly from the parabolic dependence on the temperature which is characteristic of the in - plane acoustic phonons , and tend to become significantly anisotropic due to the greater difference between the values of the @xmath208 and @xmath209 components .",
    "the intermediate diagram of each figure corresponds to an @xmath225 which , as far as the boundary scattering dominated heat transport is concerned , is characterized by comparable magnonic and phononic contributions .    another point to notice is that , away from the phonon dominated regime , even though as @xmath226 all conductivities go to zero , there is a temperature window from @xmath227 up to about @xmath228 within which the nel total conductivity is markedly lower than the total conductivities of the other three magnetic phases which have higher but nearby values . in addition , the total conductivity of the nel phase ( either component ) seems to saturate slower than all the other conductivities within the examined temperature window .",
    "this can be traced back to the structure of the lowest magnon bands of the different ordered states . as will be detailed below",
    ", the particular feature of the nel state is that it has a nearly isotropic magnon band whose minimum is located at the center ( @xmath229 point ) of its corresponding 1bz .",
    "however , let us first introduce some useful terminology that will be employed for the structural description of the various magnon bands .    in all the following analysis ( and sections )",
    "we will use the term @xmath230 to refer to the gapless magnon bands which approach zero energies with non - zero group velocities ( as also happens with the acoustic phonons ) and the term @xmath231 to refer to the gapless mag - non bands which approach zero energies with zero group velocities .",
    "for the zig - zag phase , all the four magnon bands are important at low temperatures ( since all of them have magnon valleys ) , and further , half of them are strongly anisotropic whereas the rest half are nearly isotropic .",
    "in addition , all four bands have stiff anisotropy and magnon valleys far from the center of the corresponding 1bz . for the stripy and the ferromagnetic phase on the other hand ,",
    "only half of their bands are important at low temperatures . in either case",
    "the bands are softly anisotropic , and further , the magnon valleys of the stripy phase are away from the center of the corresponding 1bz , whereas the ferromagnetic phase has its magnon valley at the center of the corresponding 1bz . finally , for the nel phase , both of its bands are important at low temperatures , and further , both magnon bands have their minima at the center ( @xmath229 point ) of the corresponding 1bz , with the one band being stiffly isotropic and the other being stiffly anisotropic around the corresponding valleys .    as will be seen in the following discussion , the presence of a stiffly ( nearly ) isotropic band with a valley ( minimum ) at the center of the corresponding 1bz ( @xmath229 point ) has some special properties .",
    "the lowest magnon bands of the ferromagnetic and the stripy phases are @xmath232 which implies that at very low temperatures there can be many more excited magnon quasiparticles compared to the phases which are @xmath233 .",
    "the zig - zag phase is partially @xmath232 and partially @xmath233 , but all of its magnon bands are gapless which implies more spin wave valleys . as a result",
    ", there can again be many excited magnon quasiparticles .",
    "the nel phase , which is a @xmath233 phase with half the bands and fewer valleys ( @xmath234 ) compared to the zig - zag phase , does nt have any of the aforementioned leeway to increase the population of its low energy magnon quasiparticles ( remember that a significant contribution at low temperatures comes from the nearly isotropic valley at the center of the corresponding 1bz ) , and this in turn delays the corresponding saturation of its total thermal conductivity ( even if it is magnon - dominated ) .",
    "now , given the previous analysis , it seems that the deviation from isotropy ( in the magnon bands of interest ) leads to a faster saturation of the total conductivity , other than an induced difference between the values of the two diagonal components of the thermal conductivity tensor .",
    "it can further be seen from the top and the middle panel of figs .",
    "[ fig : balisticfigxx ] and [ fig : balisticfigyy ] that as the temperature increases above zero , the @xmath208 component of the stripy phase and the @xmath209 component of the zig - zag phase seem to saturate first .",
    "the reason for this is that for a temperature gradient along the @xmath210 direction ( fig.[fig : zigzagcell ] , appendix  [ sec : magnon_spectrum ] ) , the stripy phase has its softest magnon modes in that direction , whereas for a temperature gradient along the @xmath211 direction ( fig.[fig : zigzagcell ] , appendix  [ sec : magnon_spectrum ] ) , the zig - zag phase has its softest magnon modes along that direction .    before concluding this section",
    ", it is worth mentioning that close inspection of the top and the bottom diagrams of the figs .",
    "[ fig : balisticfigxx ] and [ fig : balisticfigyy ] leads to the additional conclusion that the greater heat current ( i.e. the greater contribution to the total thermal conductivity ) is carried by the heat carriers with the greater characteristic energy scale ( and therefore the greater group velocities ) . as a measure of the validity of the last statement one can use the low temperature behavior predicted by the two dimensional debye model ( its no saturation sign ) as well as the degree of isotropy of the total thermal conductivity that are typical of phonon contributions , and check how the resulting conductivity deviates from the aforementioned typical behavior as one moves toward the magnon dominated side of the fully ballistic regime .    in the following section we will focus on the effect of the weak magnon - phonon scattering on the magnon dominated and the phonon dominated heat transport , using the results of the fully ballistic regime ( magnons and phonons included ) examined in this section as a reference .",
    "in this section we focus on the effect of weak magnon - phonon scattering on the phonon dominated heat transport , using the results of the fully ballistic regime as a reference .",
    "( from now on , by this term we mean the boundary scattering dominated phononic heat transport . )",
    "one reason for this is that all the factors appearing in the formula of the thermal conductivity tensor are the same for both the boundary and the magnon - phonon relaxation processes , except for the corresponding transport relaxation time .",
    "therefore , any deviations of the thermal conductivity results from the respective pure boundary scattering results are attributed to magnon - phonon scattering ( since they originate from transport relaxation times that diverge from the boundary scattering ones ) . however , before proceeding to the results it would be advisable to first discuss some subtle points that were taken into account in our analysis .",
    "first , the presumed weak magnon - phonon scattering is to a good extent ensured by working at temperatures much lower than the minimum of the debye and the magnon characteristic temperature , at which the ionic displacements from their equilibrium positions are small ( significantly smaller than a typical lattice constant ) . given this , provided that phonon induced changes in the bond lengths and bond angles do not lead to any drastic increase of the gradients of the exchange couplings @xcite ( if they lead to a drastic decrease as happens in various phenomenological models for the distance dependence of the exchange couplings that does not create any problem ) , the magnon phonon couplings @xmath235 and @xmath236 are always much smaller than the exchange couplings @xmath237 and @xmath238 , respectively .",
    "then the lowest order perturbative treatment of the magnon - phonon interaction is well justified .",
    "strictly speaking , the distance dependence of the exchange couplings necessitates sophisticated first principle calculations , but keeping in mind that exchange couplings actually originate from electronic exchange paths mediated by neighboring atomic orbital overlaps , an order of magnitude calculation of the gradients of the exchange couplings is feasible and can give an estimate of the strength of the magnon - phonon coupling ( see the lines prior to eq . ) .",
    "secondly , as far as the boundary scattering mechanism is concerned , both types of acoustic phonons ( transverse and longitudinal ) are taken into account via a debye model adjusted to 2d systems . as far",
    "as the magnon - phonon scattering mechanism is concerned only the transverse phonon is taken into account for the conductivity calculation .",
    "the last approximation is tied to the assumption that the magnon - phonon scattering is more important for the longitudinal rather than the transverse ( acoustic ) phonon , which implies that heat conduction is predominantly borne by the transverse phonon ( since the other phonon is scattered too much to contribute to the conduction of the heat and is therefore neglected ) .",
    "another reasoning for this approximation is related to the fact that the main effect of the long - wavelength transverse acoustic phonons is to slightly change / perturb the equilibrium angles between neighboring bonds , whereas , the long - wavelength longitudinal acoustic phonons can change both the equilibrium angles between neighboring bonds ( actually depending on their direction of propagation they can be more or less effective ) , and more important the lengths of the interatomic bonds . as a result ,",
    "in all cases in which the exchange couplings are much more sensitive to perturbations in the bond lengths ( i.e. the radial interionic distances ) than in the bond angles , the assumption of a stronger magnon - phonon coupling for the longitudinal acoustic phonon seems to be well justified .",
    "having in mind the previous discussion , it is noted that the transverse acoustic phonon is subject to magnon - phonon scattering via a much weaker magnon - phonon coupling constant than the one assumed for the longitudinal acoustic phonon , and this is taken computationally into account by using a @xmath239 @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the magnon - phonon coupling constant used for the longitudinal acoustic phonons , and @xmath242 is a reduction factor such that @xmath243 .",
    "afterwards , the relative strength of the magnon - phonon and boundary scattering , for the ( long - wavelength ) transverse acoustic phonon assumes , after partitioning it in a dimensional and a dimensionless part , the form ( juxtapose with eq . ) @xmath244 where for convenience we set @xmath245    thirdly , for the heat transport process to be phonon dominated , it is legitimately required that the phonon and the magnon energy scales are sufficiently different from each other , and it turns out computationally that a ratio of @xmath246 between the phonon and the magnon energy scales suffices to render the thermal conductivity phonon dominated ( by order of magnitude ) . under those conditions , as already elaborated in the previous sections , it is sufficient to focus only on one type of heat carriers ( in this case the phonons ) for an approximate calculation of the thermal conductivity ( because @xmath247 the boltzmann kinetic equation of the dominant heat carriers is employed for the calculation of the thermal conductivity ) , treating the much less significant heat carriers as a bath with which the dominant heat carriers can exchange energy quasi - elastically ( weak system - bath coupling ) , as well as momentum . since the characteristic energy scale ratio @xmath248 was incorporated into the newly - defined parameter @xmath249 of eq .",
    "[ @xmath197 was defined right below eq . ] , the @xmath249 expressed as @xmath250 , @xmath251 , is treated as a tunable parameter via which one can computationally access the different phonon dominated subregimes : ballistic , intermediate and diffusive , where now , this subcategorization is based on the competition between the boundary and the magnon - phonon relaxation mechanism during the phonon dominated heat transport process .    finally , it should be stressed one more time that only sufficiently low temperatures are considered in this work for reasons that were described at various points in the previous analysis ( well - defined low energy excitations for the lattice and the magnetic degrees of freedom , weak magnon - phonon coupling , negligible higher order phonon - phonon , magnon - magnon and magnon - phonon processes and so on , are all required to simplify the problem ) .",
    "particularly , for the phonon dominated heat transport since a lower energy scale is set by the magnons , a rather safe upper limit for the temperature range of interest is set by the magnon characteristic energy , by exploring temperatures smaller than @xmath252 . respectively , the units of the thermal conductivity are now naturally expressed in terms of the magnon energy scale @xmath180 as well .",
    "particularly , in the phonon dominated ballistic ( boundary scattering dominated ) subregime where the length @xmath163 of the crystal plays a significant role , the natural units to measure the thermal conductivity are @xmath253 .",
    "with all the aforementioned details in mind , let us now turn our attention to the figs .",
    "[ fig : phononfigs1 ] and [ fig : phononfigs2 ] below which show the per unit area components of the phononic conductivity tensor @xmath208 and @xmath209 , and respectively , the same quantities divided by the temperature squared , for each ordered phase , for the three different subregimes mentioned previously ( ballistic , intermediate and diffusive , see the legend of each subfigure ) as well as for pure boundary scattering , versus temperature .     and @xmath209 component of the phononic thermal conductivity per unit area , for each ordered phase , for three different subregimes : ballistic , intermediate and diffusive ( see the legend of each subfigure ) as well as pure boundary scattering , versus temperature .",
    "the spatial directions @xmath210 and @xmath211 are defined as in fig.[fig : zigzagcell ] , appendix  [ sec : magnon_spectrum ] . ]     and @xmath254 component of the phononic thermal conductivity per unit area , for each ordered phase , for three different subregimes : ballistic , intermediate and diffusive ( see the legend of each subfigure ) as well as pure boundary scattering , versus temperature .",
    "the spatial directions @xmath210 and @xmath211 are defined as in fig.[fig : zigzagcell ] , appendix  [ sec : magnon_spectrum ] . ]    as already noted above , both acoustic phonons are subject to boundary as well as magnon - phonon scattering . since heat conduction is of primary interest , we focus only on the transverse acoustic phonon ( the longitudinal one comes in only through boundary scattering , via the 2d debye model , and its contribution to the heat conduction becomes negligible as one moves away from the purely ballistic deep to the diffusive phonon dominated subregime where it is strongly scattered via the magnon - phonon mechanism ) .",
    "since the pure boundary scattering for phonons at low temperatures follows exactly the @xmath255 behavior ( as a result of the 2d debye model ) , fig.[fig : phononfigs2 ] actually shows the deviation of the thermal conductivity ( due to the transverse long wavelength acoustic phonon ) from the @xmath255 low temperature behavior , as one goes from the fully ballistic deep to the diffusive phonon dominated subregime ( by tuning the @xmath250 parameter defined above ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : phononfigs1 ] and [ fig : phononfigs2 ] the black curves correspond to boundary scattering dominated phononic heat transport , whereas the red ( and the green in fig.[fig : phononfigs2 ] ) curves correspond to the ballistic subregime , where this term now refers to a situation in which the phononic heat transport is mostly ( but not purely ) boundary scattering dominated . in the intermediate subregime ,",
    "as already stressed above , both scattering mechanisms ( boundary and magnon - phonon ) affect the transverse long wavelength acoustic phonon .",
    "it is worth noting that the cross - over from the purely ballistic to the diffusive subregime takes place by gradually decreasing the strength of the boundary scattering ( i.e. by increasing the length of the crystal ) , and along the way the magnon - phonon scattering mechanism is gradually unmasked until it dominates over the boundary scattering mechanism , deep in the diffusive subregime .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : phononfigs1 ] and [ fig : phononfigs2 ] , it is easily observed that the thermal conductivity is actually isotropic for @xmath256 subregimes , since the @xmath208 and the @xmath209 components almost coincide with each other .",
    "this is a consequence of the ( intrinsic ) isotropic nature of the phonon band structure .",
    "absolute coincidence , upon deviation from the boundary scattering dominated ( or fully ballistic ) subregime , is not possible because of the interplay with the magnon bath whose band structure is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the qualitative conclusion is that in the phonon dominated regime , no matter how anisotropic the band structure of the magnon bath is , the phonon thermal conductivity succeeds in retaining its isotropic character even deeply in the diffusive subregime of the phonon dominated regime .",
    "a second striking aspect of the diagrams of fig.[fig : phononfigs2 ] ( this is hard to be noticed in the diagrams of fig.[fig : phononfigs1 ] ) is the fact that for all the magnetic phases , except for the stripy phase , the magnon - phonon scattering mechanism seems to start taking effect at fairly low temperatures .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that at the low temperature limit used in the calculations ( @xmath257 ) passing from the fully ballistic to the diffusive subregime ( i.e. from the top to the bottom of each subfigure ) , the values of the phononic thermal conductivity components deviate significantly from the values of the corresponding top black curve which conforms to the @xmath255 low temperature behavior , and this of course is indicative of magnon - phonon scatterings at such low temperatures .",
    "this last effect , easily seen , is strongest for the nel phase and weakest for the stripy phase .",
    "saying so , one then is naturally led to the following two qualitative results .",
    "the first qualitative result is that within the phonon dominated regime , at very low temperatures , high energy acoustic phonons can sufficiently effectively be scattered by low energy magnons whose band structure has ( at least ) a pair of @xmath258 gapless magnon bands , of sufficiently different stiffness ( the more different the stiffnesses the better ) .",
    "these magnon bands can be isotropic or anisotropic or both ( one isotropic , one anisotropic , as happens in the nel phase ) , but they must both have their minima ( their valleys ) at the center of the 1bz ( where the acoustic phonon spectra have their minima as well ) .",
    "this conclusion also agrees with the results of ref . [ ] in which , at very low temperatures ( liquid helium temperatures ) , high energy phonons are scattered ( though mildly ) by low energy magnons whose band structure consists of a pair of stiff magnon bands , of slightly different stiffness , which are isotropic and both have their minima at the center of the 1bz .",
    "the second qualitative result is that within the phonon dominated regime , at very low temperatures , high energy acoustic phonons can not be scattered by low energy magnons whose band structure consists of gapless magnon bands which are soft , and whose minima ( valleys ) are non - degenerate , far away from the center of the 1bz as well as far away from each other .",
    "this is exactly the case with the stripy phase , which has two low energy gapless magnon bands on the one hand , but which on the other hand are softly anisotropic , have their valleys far from the center of the 1bz , and all the valleys are located at different points of the @xmath67-space . as a result , there is only one softly anisotropic band around each valley whose magnons can not satisfy energy conservation by interacting with the fast moving phonons .    in conclusion , we mention that as one passes from the fully ballistic deeply to the diffusive subregime , the phononic thermal conductivity keeps decreasing as a result of the stronger and stronger magnon - phonon scattering compared to the boundary scattering ( since the magnon - phonon coupling constant is always weak as discussed previously ) .",
    "the last effect is expected within the model we study since the magnon bands of whichever magnetic phase ( even the lower energy bands of the pha - ses which have well separated in energy magnon bands ) do not saturate within the temperature window employed in this analysis .      in this section",
    "we focus on the effect of the weak magnon - phonon scattering on the magnon dominated heat transport , using the results of the fully ballistic subregime ( which from now on implies boundary scattering dominated magnonic heat transport ) as a reference .",
    "any deviations of the thermal conductivity results from the respective fully ballistic results are attributed to magnon - phonon scattering ( since they originate from transport relaxation times that diverge from the purely ballistic ones ) . before proceeding to the results it is helpful to pause and discuss how the arguments presented in the introduction of the previous section are modified for the magnon dominated heat transport that is examined here .",
    "first , the presumed weak magnon - phonon scattering is ensured by working at temperatures much lower than the minimum of the debye and the magnon characteristic temperature .",
    "second , both for the boundary scattering and the magnon - phonon scattering mechanism @xmath256 magnon bands are taken into account ( a debye - like approximation turns out to be a poor one for the magnons due the highly anisotropic nature and non - linear dispersion of the magnon bands ) .",
    "third , as far as the magnon - phonon scattering mechanism is concerned only the longitudinal phonon is taken into account for the magnon conductivity calculation , since according to the arguments given in the previous section , any magnon - phonon scattering is predominantly caused by the longitudinal rather than the transverse acoustic phonon .",
    "therefore , the approximation that is adopted is that the diffusive regime of the magnon dominated heat transport originates from the interaction with the longitudinal acoustic phonons .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that for the heat transport process to be magnon dominated , the phonon and the magnon energy scales must be sufficiently different from each other , and it turns out computationally that a ratio of @xmath259 between the phonon and the magnon energy scales suffices to render the thermal conductivity magnon dominated ( by order of magnitude ) .    under those conditions , as was already stressed in the previous sections , it is sufficient to focus only on one type of heat carriers ( in this case the magnons ) for an approximate calculation of the thermal conductivity ( because @xmath247 the boltzmann kinetic equation of the dominant heat carriers is employed for the calculation of the thermal conductivity ) .",
    "the less significant heat carriers are then treated as a bath ( in this case the phonons ) with which the dominant heat carriers can exchange energy quasi - elastically ( weak system - bath coupling ) , as well as momentum . as a reminder , the relative strength of the magnon - phonon and boundary scattering is now given by eq .",
    ", and the tunable parameter via which one can computationally access the different magnon dominated subregimes ( ballistic , intermediate , diffusive ) is the parameter @xmath197 ( defined right below eq . ) , which can more conveniently be expressed as @xmath260 , @xmath251 ( to induce order of magnitude changes in the relative strength of the two scattering mechanisms ) .     and @xmath209 component of the magnonic thermal conductivity per unit area , for each ordered phase , for three different subregimes : ballistic , intermediate and diffusive ( see the legend of each subfigure ) as well as pure boundary scattering , versus temperature .",
    "the spatial directions @xmath210 and @xmath211 are defined as in fig.[fig : zigzagcell ] , appendix  [ sec : magnon_spectrum ] . ]     and @xmath261 component of the magnonic thermal conductivity per unit area , for each ordered phase , for three different subregimes : ballistic , intermediate and diffusive ( see the legend of each subfigure ) as well as pure boundary scattering , versus temperature .",
    "the appropriate temperature exponent @xmath156 that should divide @xmath208 and @xmath209 such that the pure boundary scattering results are represented by horizontal straight lines ( at least at low temperatures ) is given in the nearby yellow inset .",
    "the exponents can slightly vary for the spatial directions @xmath210 and @xmath211 , as defined in fig.[fig : zigzagcell ] , appendix  [ sec : magnon_spectrum ] . ]",
    "we can now turn our attention to the results of figs .",
    "[ fig : magnonfig1 ] and [ fig : magnonfig2 ] which show the behavior of the components of the magnonic thermal conductivity tensor versus temperature , for all ordered phases , for each subregime ( ballistic , intermediate , diffusive ) as well as pure boundary scattering . in the results of fig.[fig : magnonfig2 ] there was an attempt to find a power law for the temperature dependence of the pure boundary scattering mechanism ( at least in the low temperature limit of the examined temperature window ) so that the respective results lie on a horizontal line ( and this is important since by doing so , it is much easier to see the deviations in the results caused by the complementary magnon - phonon scattering mechanism ) .",
    "as can be seen from that figure , the temperature exponent can be slightly different for the @xmath210 and @xmath211 directions , as happens for the nel and the fm phase .",
    "further , for all the magnetic phases except for the nel one , it was possible to find a power of the temperature by which the pure boundary scattering results can be divided so that they all lie along a straight line over the whole examined temperature window ( for the nel phase the given exponents cover only the low temperature limit denoted by the horizontal arrows in the top subfigure of fig.[fig : magnonfig2 ] ) .    furthermore , from the figs .",
    "[ fig : magnonfig1 ] and [ fig : magnonfig2 ] it is easily seen that the anisotropy of the magnonic conductivity tensor fades away as one moves from the purely ballistic deep to the purely diffusive subregime , and this happens because of the stronger and stronger magnon - phonon scattering from the longitudinal phonons ( the deeper we enter the diffusive subregime ) , or to put it differently , stronger and stronger scattering of the ( lower energy ) magnons by the ( low energy ) isotropic longitudinal acoustic phonons gradually washes out any residual anisotropic features of the magnon band structure from the magnonic thermal conductivity .",
    "it should further be noticed that the aforementioned effect is stronger for soft low energy magnon bands compared to the analogous effect for stiff low energy magnon bands .",
    "saying so , a qualitative argument that can be given here is that for the softly anisotropic phases ( the fm and the stripy phase ) the anisotropy of the magnonic conductivity tensor starts diminishing earlier with increasing temperature ( i.e. for the aforementioned two phases , the anisotropy of the magnonic conductivity is significantly diminished already at very low temperatures ) , as opposed to the stiffly anisotropic phases ( the zigzag and the nel phase ) , whose magnon thermal conductivity manages to partially retain the magnon band anisotropies up to higher temperatures .",
    "the previous argument is supported by looking at the low temperature side ( leftmost side ) of each subfigure of fig.[fig : magnonfig2 ] , whereby one can see that due to the intense magnon - phonon scattering , the magnonic conductivity is significantly suppressed compared to its corresponding purely ballistic value . however , the suppression is weaker for the stiffly anisotropic phases ( especially for the zigzag phase ) , where the magnon conductivity is not significantly suppressed from its purely ballistic value unless ones goes to higher temperatures .",
    "another feature that one can observe by looking at the subfigures of fig.[fig : magnonfig1 ] is that the magnon conductivity of all the magnetic phases seems to saturate within the temperature window employed in this study , except for the nel phase which tends to saturation slower than all the other phases .",
    "an explanation for this is that , because the low energy magnon band of the nel phase is stiffly nearly isotropic , with its magnon valley at the center of the 1bz ( where the acoustic phonon bands also have their minima ) , the strong magnon - phonon scattering mainly affects the lower energy magnons which also have very small wavevectors , whereas the higher energy magnons which are more effective in transporting heat continue to propagate less impeded by the longitudinal acoustic phonons .",
    "concluding this section , we emphasize that the magno - nic conductivies of the various magnetic phases differ more markedly from each other closer to the ballistic subregime ( or the pure boundary scattering subregime ) compared to the diffusive one . in addition , at very low temperatures ( the lower temperature limit of our plots ) the boundary scattering mechanism ( fig.[fig : magnonfig2 ] , see the yellow insets ) seems to approximately follow some particular power law , that varies markedly between the stiffly and the softly anisotropic phases ( nel and zigzag , and stripy and fm , respectively ) .",
    "a further discrimination between the stripy and the fm phase on the one hand , and the zigzag and the nel phase on the other , deeply within the ballistic subregime , comes from the fact that the values of the two components of the magnon conductivity tensor of the nel and the fm phase follow slightly different power laws ( at low temperatures ) as opposed to the magnon conductivity components of the other two magnetic phases , which can be described by a common power law .",
    "in this work we studied the thermal conductivity of electrically insulating local moment models with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "as a specific example , we studied the nearest - neighbor heisenberg - kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice , whose ground state properties ( magnetic orders ) are well established .",
    "in particular , for different model parameters , nel , stripy , zig - zag , and ferromagnetic phases are realized .",
    "the richness of the phase diagram originates in the spin - orbit coupling . for these four magnetic phases ,",
    "the magnon spectra were initially computed within the linear spin wave approximation . then , using fermi s golden rule in conjunction with the magnon and the phonon spectra , the scattering rates for the lowest order magnon - phonon scattering processes , the two - magnon one - phonon processes , were calculated .",
    "finally , the kinetic boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation was employed for the calculation of the magnonic and the phononic thermal conductivities .",
    "the evaluation of the scattering rates was among the most technically challenging aspects of this work , and we had to innovate in order to find an efficient method of computing these rates for the multiple magnon branches .",
    "the procedure we followed and described in this paper can be generalized to any two - dimensional magnon - phonon system .",
    "several results and qualitative conclusions for the magnon dominated and the phonon dominated heat transport are contained in sec.[sec : thermal_conductivity ] .",
    "we emphasize again that each of the previous regimes is further broken down into three main transport subregimes : the ballistic , the diffusive , and the intermediate subregime .",
    "we have also included some discussion of how to estimate which regime may be most relevant to a particular material of a given size .",
    "a central result of this analysis is that the effect of the strong spin orbit coupling on the magnetic degrees of freedom , which is to induce anisotropies in the band structures of the low energy magnetic excitations , can most efficiently be probed by measuring the ballistic thermal conductivity of a material whose heat transport is magnon dominated .    when the phonon energy dominates the magnon energy , the thermal conductivity primarily reflects the spatially isotropic phonon band structure .",
    "in this case , the the thermal conductivity tensor remains isotropic , and in the ballistic subregime , at low temperatures , follows a quadratic temperature power law ( reminiscent of the 2d debye model ) . on the other side ,",
    "when the magnon energy dominates the phonon energy , the thermal conductivity tensor of the various phases shows significant anisotropic behavior that is strongest within the ballistic subregime .",
    "in addition to this , the thermal conductivity of different magnetic phases are found to follow different temperature dependences , even at very low temperatures .",
    "by carefully analyzing the low temperature dependence and the degree of anisotropy of the thermal conductivity tensor , one may be able to use thermal transport to infer important features of the magnetic order and excitation spectrum that are not easily obtained by other means .",
    "for example , the large neutron absorption cross - section of iridium makes measurements of the magnon spectrum even in bulk iridates difficult .",
    "the small signal from resonant inelastic x - ray scattering in a two - dimensional system also makes determination of magnetic order and excitations challenging .",
    "thus , thermal transport may offer a window into the magnetic degrees of freedom where other methods present challenges . on the experimental side , measurements of the thermal conductivity of the soc - induced mott insulator @xmath262",
    "were recently reported @xcite , which by comparison with the thermal conductivity of the @xmath263 antiferromagnet , led to the conclusion that the thermal conductivity of the former is highly suppressed due to strong magnon - phonon coupling , and this effect was then correlated with strong spin - orbit coupling of the iridate .",
    "we hope this work will help stimulate future theoretical and experimental work on thermal transport in insulating local moment systems with strong - spin orbit coupling , since the methodology followed in this work opens a new window to study systems which previously were technically unapproachable .",
    "particularly , magnetically insulating systems that can not be approached analytically as far as the magnon - phonon interaction problem is concerned , can be numerically approached by the above methodology which relies on the use of a general numerical bogoliubov transformation for the derivation of the magnon - phonon interaction hamiltonian and the calculation of magnon - phonon transport relaxation times , even in the presence of anisotropic magnon bands .",
    "these anisotropies are commonplace within the newly discovered field of magnonics , as well as among materials with strong - spin orbit coupling .",
    "such materials may be relevant to applications in spin caloritronics and other spin - based energy , computing , and communications applications .",
    "finally , we note that theoretical estimates of the magnon - phonon relaxation times , that are possible within the above methodology , could be useful to experimentalists who want to know ( approximately ) the strength of the magnon - phonon relaxation time in their specific systems of study ( to the extent that the heat transport is dominated by the mechanisms studied in this work ) .",

    "is mostly carried by the phonons , which at low enough temperatures can be treated as non - interacting quasiparticles , which weakly interact with a bath which in this case is the magnons . under those conditions we attempt to solve the stationary boltzmann equation within the so - called @xmath382 , and the current situation can be treated similarly to the impurity scattering of the electrons .",
    "quite generally , the collision term can be put into the following form ( @xmath19 denotes the area , and our analysis is adjusted to 2d ) @xmath383=\\frac{1}{a}\\sum_{\\bm{q'}}\\left(w_{\\bm{q'}\\to\\bm{q } } - w_{\\bm{q}\\to\\bm{q ' } }   \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath384 denotes the probability per unit time for a phonon to be scattered from @xmath385 to @xmath24 in a given scattering process , which encompasses not only microscopic probabilities for quantum transitions but also the single - particle distribution function itself . more specifically ,",
    "if the quantum transition probability per unit time , denoted as @xmath386 for a phononic scattering process from the state of wavevector @xmath385 to a state of wavevector @xmath24 is known ( this last quantity is directly related to the @xmath387 of the analysis of the main text ) , then the probability @xmath388 can be expressed directly in terms of the microscopic probability @xmath386 and @xmath389 ( actually @xmath390 for the stationary case that is of interest here ) .",
    "furthermore , from eq .",
    "it is @xmath391=\\frac{1}{a}\\sum_{\\bm{q'}}\\left(w_{\\bm{q'}\\to\\bm{q } } \\left(f_s(\\bm{q})+1 \\right ) - w_{\\bm{q}\\to\\bm{q ' } } f_s(\\bm{q } )   \\right)=\\frac{1}{a}\\sum_{\\bm{q'}}w_{\\bm{q'}\\to\\bm{q } } \\left(f_s(\\bm{q})+1 \\right)-\\frac{1}{a}\\sum_{\\bm{q ' } } w_{\\bm{q}\\to\\bm{q ' } } f_s(\\bm{q } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv i_{in}[f_s]-i_{out}[f_s],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the rightmost term of eq .",
    "the collision term is decomposed into two parts , one related to inscattering and the other related to outscattering processes . under thermal equilibrium conditions",
    "the inscattering and the outscattering processes should compensate each other leading to the result @xmath392 where @xmath393 is the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "assuming that the applied temperature gradient is such that the departure of the single - particle distribution function from its equilibrium value is small , i.e. @xmath394 , from eqs . and",
    "to lowest order it is @xmath395\\approx -\\bigg(\\frac{1}{a } \\sum_{\\bm{q'}}\\big(w_{\\bm{q}\\to\\bm{q ' } } - w_{\\bm{q'}\\to\\bm{q } } \\big ) \\bigg ) f_s^1(\\bm{q})=-\\bigg [ \\frac{1}{a } \\sum_{\\bm{q'}}\\big(w_{\\bm{q}\\to\\bm{q ' } } - w_{\\bm{q'}\\to\\bm{q } } \\big ) \\bigg ] \\big(f_s(\\bm{q})-f_s^0(\\bm{q})\\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define the so - called @xmath396 as below @xmath397 notice that the result of eq . per unit area",
    "is directly related to eqs . and that were derived in the phonon - dominated thermal transport regime .",
    "notice also that the microscopic transition probabilities @xmath398 and @xmath386 do not necessarily balance each other ( as happens in the problem of the elastic scattering of an electron from impurities ) , and more specifically , to ensure the @xmath399 of the phonon relaxation time defined above it should be true that @xmath400 , and of course the quantity @xmath401 should be bounded ( not infinite ) . under the aforementioned conditions , the weak interaction of phonons with the magnon bath ( under a weak temperature gradient )",
    "can be described via the concept of the @xmath402 .    combining eqs .",
    ", , and we get ( using again the approximation of @xmath394 ) @xmath403 and neglecting on the lhs ( left hand side ) the term that depends on @xmath404 ( as being smaller compared to the other term on the lhs ) , to lowest order it is @xmath405 or finally @xmath406    let us now connect the above results ( of the stationary case ) with the thermal conductivity tensor . the total heat current carried by phonons with single - particle distribution function @xmath407 , summing over all different phonon polarizations ,",
    "is ( adjusted to 2d ) @xmath408 combining eqs .",
    "and we find ( the term containing the equilibrium distribution function of the phonons does not participate in the heat current and is dropped ) @xmath409 and recalling the definition of the thermal conductivity tensor @xmath410 via the fourier law of heat transport ( adjusted to a 2d system ) which reads @xmath411 we find for the @xmath412 the following expression ( notice that in order to get the correct units we need to take into account the relaxation time per unit area as defined in eq . )",
    "@xmath413    before concluding this section , let us mention that all the aforementioned analysis can also be applied to magnons weakly interacting with a phonon bath , as happens in the magnon - dominated transport regime , of course with the appropriate modifications .",
    "the more general case in which both types of carriers participate significantly in the total thermal conductivity requires a more sophisticated treatment than the one given here .",
    "to calculate the line integrals ( reduction comes upon using the property of the dirac @xmath153 function mentioned in the main text ) appearing in various scattering rates ( magnonic or phononic ) , one needs to find the path of integration dictated by the energy conservation constraint . for instance , for the magnon scattering rates of the following general form @xmath414 for each given @xmath415 point of interest , one needs to know all @xmath416 points that satisfy the energy conservation constraint @xmath417 first , and then perform the line - integral over these points numerically . due to high non - linearity of the magnon dispersion relations simple analytical expressions are not possible .",
    "thus , the energy constraint was graphically solved like this : for a specific temperature @xmath418 , a grid of @xmath419-points were taken in the vicinity of the various magnon valleys , and for each one of those @xmath67-points a contour plot of the energy constraint was created . from each contour plot , all the @xmath416 points that satisfy the energy constraint for that fixed @xmath415 point were extracted , and were then used to compute the reduced integral .",
    "this way , the quantity @xmath420 for every @xmath415-point was calculated , and further , the whole previous calculation was repeated for each temperature of the chosen temperature window for this study . in the semiclassical boltzmann approach to the thermal conductivity",
    ", the quantity @xmath420 enters within a second integral , this time over the magnon momentum space of interest ( i.e. over the @xmath67 space ) , whereby one finally gets the magnon thermal conductivity .",
    "a similar procedure is followed for the calculation of the phononic thermal conductivity .    as a last note , to get the constant energy surfaces for a fixed temperature value , for a given wavevector of the one quasiparticle type , the various points of the contour plot of the energy constraint were extracted using the following mathematica command : @xmath421,line[data\\ _ ] } \\rightarrow \\texttt{data,5]}$ ] .",
