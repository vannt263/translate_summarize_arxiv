    "the @xmath0-pdf shape should be sensitive to physical processes occurring in the clouds .",
    "for example , simulations of driven supersonic hydrodynamic ( and if including magnetic fields , super - alfvnic ) turbulence of non - self - gravitating gas in periodic boxes yield lognormal @xmath0-pdfs ( e.g. , federrath 2013 ; padoan et al .",

    "however , simulations of self - gravitating , strongly - magnetized ( trans - alfvnic ) , turbulent clouds with non - periodic boundary conditions are also needed for comparison with observed @xmath0-pdfs .",
    "such clouds are expected to have smaller star formation efficiencies per mean free - fall time , @xmath14 , likely implying they would have smaller mass fractions in any high-@xmath0 power law tail .",
    "accurate quantification of the @xmath0-pdf in real star - forming clouds is needed to constrain theoretical models .",
    "observationally , kainulainen et al .",
    "( 2009 [ k09 ] ) performed nir extinction mapping of @xmath1520 nearby clouds , ranging from `` quiescent , '' non - star - forming clouds to more active clouds .",
    "they found quiescent cloud @xmath0-pdfs are well - described by lognormals , while star - forming clouds have high-@xmath0 power law tails .",
    "note , in practice a lognormal is fit to the observed @xmath16 , which is then used to derive @xmath17 ( over the considered range of @xmath0 ) , which then defines the mean @xmath18 , where @xmath13 is standard deviation of @xmath19 ( butler et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter btk14 ) .",
    "however , the ability of this observational method to accurately measure the position of the @xmath0-pdf peak , typically at @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath21 : we adopt conversion @xmath22 ( kainulainen & tan 2013 [ kt13 ] ) in the k09 clouds , has been questioned by schneider et al .",
    "( 2015a ) and lombardi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) due to difficulties of disentangling foreground and background contributions .",
    "lombardi et al . argued that low-@xmath0 pdf uncertainties are so large that observed pdfs are all consistent with power laws .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     extending these studies to denser , higher-@xmath0 clouds , perhaps more typical of most galactic star formation , kt13 used combined nir ( kainulainen et al .",

    "these dense structures , typically several kpc away , have @xmath0-pdfs extending to @xmath23 ( e.g. , tan et al . 2014 ) .",
    "one uncertainty of these maps is choice of opacity ( i.e. , at @xmath24 ) per unit @xmath0 , with variations @xmath25 expected for different dust models , e.g. , moderately coagulated thin and thick ice mantle models of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 [ oh94 ] ) .",
    "kt13 considered simple , rectangular regions enclosing contours of @xmath26 ( @xmath27mag ) , i.e. , `` complete '' for @xmath0 above this value .",
    "however , two caveats limit this completeness : first , mir - bright regions are not treated by extinction mapping , so are excluded from the pdf ; second , extinction mapping saturates at high-@xmath0 s , depending on mir image depth , typically at @xmath28to@xmath29 for spitzer glimpse ( churchwell et al .",

    "the kt13 @xmath0-pdfs , extending down to @xmath31mag , did not cover pdf peaks well , so provided weak constraints on true shapes : pdfs could be fit with lognormals or power laws .",
    "btk14 presented a higher dynamic range @xmath0-map of irdc g028.37 + 00.07 , both to higher @xmath32 and lower @xmath33 ( @xmath34mag ) . from a @xmath35 region around the irdc ( fig .",

    "there appears to be relatively little mass in a high-@xmath0 power law tail , surprising given the irdc ( kt13 ) and gmc ( hernandez & tan 2015 [ ht15 ] ) are both self - gravitating with virial parameters close to unity and some star formation has already started .",
    "another method to measure @xmath0 is via sub - mm dust continuum emission .",

    "below this s15b claimed to detect a peak in the @xmath0-pdf at @xmath51mag .",
    "s15b proposed that presence of power law tails indicated the cloud was undergoing multi - scale , including global , quasi - free - fall collapse .    here",
    "we revisit the @xmath0-pdf toward irdc / gmc g028.37 + 00.07 , especially comparing pdfs derived from dust extinction and emission methods .",
    "we examine reasons for the different results of btk14 and s15b and derive the most accurate @xmath0-pdf of this massive protocluster .",
    "we utilize the nir+mir extinction map from btk14 with one modification .",
    "the nir extinction map , based on statistical estimates of stellar extinctions in @xmath52 regions , requires choosing an `` off - position '' of negligible local irdc / gmc extinction .",
    "btk14 utilized an off - position at @xmath53 .",
    "however , s15b noted this location may be too close to the gmc , which is confirmed in the @xmath47co(1 - 0 ) map of ht15 .",
    "we therefore choose a new off - position at @xmath54 with @xmath55 that is @xmath56mag smaller than the previous position .",
    "the net effect is to add an offset of @xmath57mag to the btk14 map .",
    "we will see this has only a minor effect on the @xmath0-pdf : in particular , the mean extinction remains close to @xmath58mag .",
    "conversion of the extinction map into a @xmath0-map requires an assumption about opacity per unit mass at a given wavelength . here for the spitzer irac @xmath59 map we adopt @xmath60 ( bt12 ) .",

    "we follow kt13 , adopting @xmath62 .",
    "overall , from consideration of different dust models ( bt12 ) , we estimate @xmath25 systematic uncertainties due to these opacity choices .",

    "derivation of @xmath0 and @xmath42 is performed via pixel - by - pixel graybody fits to the @xmath64and@xmath44 data ( e.g. , battersby et al .",
    "2011 ; s15b ) , first re - gridded at the @xmath65 image resolution of 36@xmath66 .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 and @xmath42 are derived via : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is observed intensity of the corresponding band , @xmath69 is filter - weighted value of the planck function , @xmath70 is optical depth and @xmath71 is filter - weighted opacity .",
    "however , to derive local cloud properties , the images need correction for foreground ( fg ) and background ( bg ) diffuse ism emission along the line of sight .",
    "assuming emission from the cloud in these sub - mm bands is optically thin , one method is to estimate fg+bg emission as one combined , constant intensity .",
    "s15b adopted this method , selecting a region outside the gmc of interest for fg+bg column density corresponding to @xmath72mag , which was then subtracted as a constant offset .",
    "we first assess the fg based on the ism model derived from observed @xmath73 intensities towards `` saturated '' dark regions of the irdc by lt14 and lim , carey & tan ( 2015 [ lct15 ] ) .",
    "these saturated regions , also seen at shorter wavelengths and possibly at @xmath74 , are where observed intensities are similar to within instrumental noise in spatially independent locations .",
    "this is assumed to be caused by the irdc blocking essentially all bg light , so the observed intensity is that of a spatially smooth fg .",
    "several @xmath73 fg measurements across the irdc are made and then averaged to estimate a mean .",
    "then the draine & li ( 2007 ) diffuse ism sed model is normalized to this value to predict @xmath75 filter - weighted fg values .",
    "these are subtracted from the sub - mm images , i.e. , the fg is first assumed to be constant across the irdc / gmc .",
    "once we have fg - subtracted images , we next assess the bg in two ways .",
    "first , we assess bg intensity at each wavelength adapting the `` small median filter '' ( smf ) method ( butler & tan 2009 [ bt09 ] ) , which is applied outside the irdc ellipse with square filter of 35@xmath76 size .",
    "bg emission behind the irdc ellipse is estimated via interpolation from the surrounding regions ( fig .",
    "1b ) , following the bt09 weighting scheme .    as a second , `` galactic gaussian '' ( gg ) ,",
    "method we follow battersby et al . ( 2011 ) and assume that the galactic bg follows gaussian profiles in latitude .",
    "we fit gaussians to the minimum intensities exhibited along strips with longitude width @xmath77 ( see fig . 1c and fig .  2 for examples at @xmath78 ) .",
    "the method involves clipping higher intensity values arising from discrete clouds , and iteratively converges on a final result .",
    "note , here we also assume the fg intensity is a gaussian of the same width , and subtract that off the images before deriving the final bg model .",
    "the above methods result in fg+bg - subtracted images at @xmath79 .",
    "then at each pixel we fit the graybody function ( eq .  [ eq : gb ] ) , including its filter response weighting , to derive @xmath0 and @xmath42 .",
    "this fitting requires an assumed form of @xmath80 .",
    "this has been studied via mir to fir extinction by lt14 and lct15 , who find evidence of generally flatter extinction laws over the @xmath81 to @xmath74 range as @xmath0 increases , consistent with oh94 and ormel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) dust models that include grain growth via ice mantle formation and coagulation . for consistency with these extinction results , we adopt the oh94 thin ice mantle model with @xmath82yr of coagulation at density of @xmath83 as our fiducial . at sub - mm wavelengths ,",
    "this model exhibits @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "we will also explore the effects of varying @xmath86 from 1.5 to 2 .",
    "finally , we generate higher resolution ( hires ) @xmath0 maps by re - gridding to the @xmath87 image pixels ( 18@xmath66 resolution ; 6@xmath66 pixels ) and then repeating the above analysis , but now fixing temperatures from the lower angular resolution maps .",

    "the overall result of fg+bg subtraction on the @xmath0 map is to effectively remove @xmath89 across the cloud . as we will see this has a major effect on the shape of the @xmath0-pdf .",
    "note for study of the btk14 region , we consider the gg method to be superior to smf as it allows for the large - scale structure of the galactic plane .",
    "also , the smf method tends to underestimate mass surface densities in the structures just outside the irdc ellipse .",

    "<S> we study the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of mass surface densities , @xmath0 , of infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) g028.37 + 00.07 and its surrounding giant molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this pdf constrains the physical processes , such as turbulence , magnetic fields and self - gravity , that are expected to be controlling cloud structure and star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen irdc is of particular interest since it has almost 100,000 solar masses within a radius of 8 parsecs , making it one of the most massive , dense molecular structures known and is thus a potential site for the formation of a `` super star cluster . '' </S>",
    "<S> we study @xmath0 in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , we use a combination of nir and mir extinction maps that are able to probe the bulk of the cloud structure up to @xmath1(@xmath2  mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , we study the fir and sub - mm dust continuum emission from the cloud utilizing herschel pacs and spire images and paying careful attention to the effects of foreground and background contamination . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pdfs from both methods , applied over a @xmath3(30  pc)-sized region that contains @xmath4 and encloses a minimum closed contour with @xmath5(@xmath6  mag ) , shows a log - normal shape with the peak measured at @xmath7(@xmath8  mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is tentative evidence for the presence of a high-@xmath0 power law tail that contains from @xmath9 to 8% of the mass of the cloud material . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these results for the physical processes occurring in this cloud . </S>"
