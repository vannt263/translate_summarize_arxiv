    "the hexagonal convection cells discovered by bnard in his famous experiments on thin oil layers heated from below @xcite have become the trademark of pattern formation in hydrodynamic systems driven slightly out of equilibrium ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the hundred years of research devoted to this system have revealed several important insights but also witnessed several misconceptions .",
    "rayleigh s original theoretical description @xcite focusing on buoyancy - driven convection , though indicating a possible instability mechanism , failed to produce a threshold compatible with experiment . not until forty years later was it realized that the temperature dependence of the surface tension is the crucial driving force in thin layers @xcite .",
    "the corresponding linear stability analysis @xcite gave stability thresholds consistent with the experimental findings , moreover , a subsequent weakly non - linear analysis @xcite produced theoretical support for a sub - critical transition to a hexagonal flow pattern @xcite .",
    "quite naturally the first theoretical investigations were performed using simplified models of the experimental situation .",
    "the initial assumption of a flat surface of the liquid was soon relaxed by scriven and sternling @xcite and smith @xcite who were able to show that surface deflections give rise to an additional instability appearing at very long wavelengths .",
    "it was only very recently that this instability was unambiguously demonstrated in an experiment @xcite where it manifests itself as a distortion of the layer thickness with a characteristic length which is of the order of the lateral extension of the fluid layer .",
    "being observable only in very shallow liquid layers , the instability usually results in the formation of dry spots .",
    "another common simplification is the restriction of the instability mechanism to either buoyancy or thermocapillarity @xcite , although there seem to be rather few experiments @xcite which have been performed in parameter regions with the ratio between the rayleigh and the marangoni number being sufficiently different from unity .",
    "also , most investigations focussed on a single layer model in which a lower liquid layer is in contact with a gaseous upper layer and only the hydrodynamics of the liquid are treated .",
    "the convection in the gas layer is neglected and the heat exchange between the layers is often modeled in a phenomenological way using a biot number , see e.g. @xcite . even if a genuine two layer model is considered the viscous stresses and the pressure variations in the gaseous layer",
    "are neglected in order to keep the analysis simple @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "it has been known for some time @xcite that a system of _ two superimposed liquids _ displays a much richer behaviour than the single layer models .",
    "in particular the marangoni instability can be induced by heating from _ above _ such that buoyancy and thermocapillarity compete rather than enhance each other , a situation which in single layer systems can only be realized using the rare case of liquids with anomalous thermocapillary effect in which the surface tension _ in_creases with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "many additional features such as oscillatory instabilities @xcite or transitions from up- to down - hexagons may be found in systems with two liquid layers . the rich variety of phenomena occurring in the theoretical analysis of the two - layer liquid systems results in part from their huge parameter space .",
    "a single layer system is characterized by just three dimensionless parameters ; namely , the rayleigh number , the marangoni number and the prandtl number .",
    "the latter is irrelevant in the linear analysis and the first two are both proportional to the temperature difference across the layer .",
    "two layer systems on the other hand may easily need ten or more dimensionless parameters for a complete specification .",
    "these numbers include the ratios of the hydrodynamic parameters of the participating liquids .    for a long time marangoni convection in two - liquid - layer systems",
    "was an interesting theoretical problem but too difficult to handle experimentally .",
    "already zeren and reynolds @xcite tried to experimentally realize the instability by heating from above which came out of their theoretical analysis but failed .",
    "very recently , however , experiments where performed in which the marangoni instability in 1 - 2 mm thick superimposed layers of immiscible liquids was observed @xcite . in particular",
    "an instability by heating from above and square patterns at the onset were reported .    in the present paper",
    "we will investigate theoretically bnard - marangoni convection in a system of two liquid layers .",
    "building on the linear stability theory developed in @xcite we perform a weakly non - linear analysis in order to solve the planform selection problem slightly above the linear stability threshold . to this end the competition between rolls , squares and hexagons will be discussed .",
    "only perfect patterns will be considered leaving the question of weakly modulated patterns for future investigations .",
    "we will consistently include buoyancy effects and treat the full hydrodynamics of both liquids , generalizing in this way various previous treatments @xcite .",
    "however , we will assume a flat interface between the two liquids .",
    "as will become clear below , interface distortions are crucial for the long wavelength instability resulting in dry spots but can be safely neglected when dealing with the finite wavelength instability resulting in cellular patterns .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the basic equations are collected and transformed into a form suitable for the weakly non - linear analysis .",
    "then the perturbation scheme is set up and the necessary computational steps are listed .",
    "section 3 deals with the first order of the perturbation theory which is nothing but the linear stability analysis . in section 4",
    "the main steps of the nonlinear analysis are outlined .",
    "the solution of the second order problem is relegated to appendix c and the solvability condition in third order is then formulated to derive the desired amplitude equation characterizing the planform selection problem .",
    "section 5 discusses the results obtained for some experimentally relevant combinations of liquids .",
    "finally section 6 contains a discussion of the results together with a comparison with experimental findings .",
    "we investigate a system of two layers of immiscible and incompressible liquids of thickness @xmath0 with densities @xmath1 , kinematic viscosities @xmath2 , coefficients of volume expansion @xmath3 , heat diffusivities @xmath4 , and thermal conductivities @xmath5 where the superscript @xmath6 ( 2 ) denotes the lower ( upper ) fluid ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the system is bounded in the vertical direction by two solid , perfectly heat conducting walls with fixed temperatures @xmath7 and @xmath8 and is infinite in the horizontal directions .",
    "the interface between the two fluids is assumed to be flat and to lie in the @xmath9-@xmath10-plane of the coordinate system .",
    "sketch of the system under consideration .",
    "one liquid layer is superposed on another between two horizontally infinite , perfectly heat conducting plates .",
    "the interface between the liquids is assumed to be flat .",
    "convection arises due to buoyancy and the temperature dependence of the surface tension.,width=302 ]    the hydrodynamics of the two liquids will be described within the boussinesq approximation , i.e. we assume that all parameters are independent of the temperature , except for the densities @xmath1 and the interface tension @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely we use @xmath12 and @xmath13 with constant @xmath3 and @xmath14 . neglecting heat production due to viscosity , the basic equations describing the system are the continuity equations @xmath15 the navier - stokes equations @xmath16 and the equations of heat conduction @xmath17 here @xmath18 denotes the unit vector in the vertical direction and @xmath19 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "these equations are completed by the boundary conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 at bottom and top respectively and @xmath22_{\\perp }      = -\\frac{d\\sigma}{d t}{\\nabla}_{\\perp } t \\quad , \\quad{\\boldsymbol{v}}^{(1)}_z&={\\boldsymbol{v}}^{(2)}_z=0\\quad,\\qquad\\text{at}\\quad z=0 \\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expressing the continuity of the velocities , temperatures and heat fluxes respectively as well as the balance of tangential stresses at the interface . the @xmath23 denote the stress tensors in the liquids and the subscript @xmath24 describes the projection to the @xmath9-@xmath10-plane . in accordance with our assumption of a flat interface between the liquids",
    "the condition for the continuity of the normal stress at the interface is replaced by the requirement that the perpendicular components of the flow velocities must vanish .",
    "this is expressed by the last equation in ( [ bci ] ) .    introducing @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 as units for length , time , velocity , and pressure respectively we find for the velocities @xmath29 and the appropriately normalized _ deviations _",
    "@xmath30 of the temperatures from their static profiles in the lower ( upper ) liquid the equations : @xmath31 where the pressure fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the lower and the upper liquid differ from @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively only by trivial contributions stemming from the buoyancy terms .",
    "the boundary conditions acquire the form @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 where in the last equation the continuity equation was used .",
    "moreover the following parameters have been introduced : @xmath39 as well as the prandtl - number @xmath40 , the rayleigh - number @xmath41 and the marangoni - number @xmath42 for the rayleigh- and marangoni - number we have chosen the standard expressions corresponding to the lower liquid .",
    "the respective numbers for the upper liquid are then given by @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the ratio between the rayleigh and marangoni numbers determines whether the occurring instability is predominantly driven by buoyancy or by surface tension .",
    "experimentally both parameters are varied simultaneously since they are both proportional to the temperature difference @xmath44 .",
    "we will therefore replace @xmath45 by @xmath46 with the temperature independent constant @xmath47 specifying the experimental setup . in this way both buoyancy and surface tension are included in a consistent way .",
    "we assume that @xmath48 as is the case for most systems of two liquids such that @xmath49 .",
    "note that both the situation of heating from below and heating from above are described with the latter case corresponding to @xmath50 .",
    "the set of equations may be simplified by standard manipulations .",

    "similar to the case of the rayleigh - bnard instability @xcite the no - slip boundary conditions at top and bottom suppress the vertical vorticity , i.e. @xmath54 , and therefore we do not expect problems due to a coupling to a slowly varying mean flow @xcite up to this order . from the solution of ( [ basiceq1])-([basiceq4 ] ) we hence obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 . using the continuity equations and the absence of vertical vorticity allows to determine @xmath57 and @xmath58 and finally the pressure fields follow from the navier - stokes equations .",
    "it is convenient to write the above equations in the form @xmath59 with the state vector @xmath60 and the linear operator @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 and the boundary conditions ( [ basicbc1])-([basicbc3 ] ) .",
