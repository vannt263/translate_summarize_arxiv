    "coherent interference of light scattered from different particles in an extended ensemble of polarizable point like particles leads to important modifications of the forces on the particles as well as to new inter - particle light - forces , even if the light fields are far detuned from any optical resonance  @xcite . while a full 3-d treatment certainly leads to a very rich and complex dynamics  @xcite ,",
    "key physical effects can already by discussed in effective 1d geometries .",
    "one particularly interesting example are atoms in or close to 1d  optical micro structures  @xcite as e.g.  an optical nanofibre , where even a single atom can strongly modify light propagation and forces  @xcite . in a milestone experiment rauschenbeutel and",
    "coworkers recently managed to trap cold atoms alongside a tapered optical fibre  @xcite and related setups predict and demonstrate strong back - action and inter - particle interaction  @xcite leading to the formation of periodical self - ordered arrays  @xcite . alternatively , in free space interesting dynamical effects of collective light scattering were recently predicted and studied in standard 1d  optical lattices of sufficient optical density  @xcite .",
    "one could also consider arrays of optical membranes to study such effects .",
    "in this work we extend an existing model  @xcite towards light configurations with multiple frequencies and polarizations of the fields illuminating the particles .",
    "in particular , this includes a new class of geometries where crystalline order can be dynamically generated and sustained even without prescribing a standing wave lattice geometry . as a generic example",
    "the polarizations of two counter  propagating fields can be chosen orthogonally , such that incident and scattered fields do not directly interfere .",
    "light scattering thus occurs for both fields independently and the forces on the particles can simply be added up .",
    "however , any structure forming by the scattering of one field component will be seen by all other fields and thus change their scattering properties and the induced forces . on the one hand",
    "this mediates nonlinear interaction between the different fields while on the other hand it generates inter particle interactions throughout the sample , inducing a wealth of nonlinear complex dynamical effects .",
    "besides such dynamic self - ordering phenomena , we also study the possibilities to induce tailored long range interactions via multicolour illumination and collective scattering of particles trapped in prescribed optical lattice potentials .",
    "this work is organized as follows : first we introduce the basic definitions and dynamical equations of the well  established generalized multiple scattering model for light forces  @xcite and extend this framework to support multiple polarizations and frequencies . this formalism",
    "is then applied to an orthogonal beam trap consisting of an array of particles modelled as beamsplitters irradiated by two counter propagating beams of orthogonal polarization and possibly different wavenumbers , cf .",
    "a. for two beam splitters we analytically derive conditions on the intensity ratios and wavenumbers to trap or stabilize them at a given separation .",
    "these results are then numerically extended to higher particle numbers .    .",
    "the upper graph ( a ) shows illumination from two sides with beams of orthogonal polarization , while the lower graph ( b ) shows a symmetric standing wave trap ( red ) perturbed by an extra field with orthogonal polarization ( blue ) . ]    as a generalization and connection to usual experimental setups for optical lattices we then analyze how an additional beam polarized orthogonally to a prescribed standing wave perturbs the trapped particles and induces peculiar interaction patterns , cf .",
    "b in 1d optical lattices .",
    "it is now well established that propagation of far detuned light through a one dimensional atomic lattice or an array of dielectric membranes can be well described in a plane wave approximation with multiple scattering by a corresponding series of beam splitters  @xcite .",
    "a very analogous situation arises when the light is transversely strongly confined by optical structures so that scattering dominantly occurs along a preferred direction .",
    "the spatial dynamics of the electric field @xmath0 is then described by the 1d helmholtz ",
    "equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the total number of beam splitters at positions @xmath3 ; @xmath4 is a dimensionless parameter proportional to the atomic polarizability @xmath5 , the wavenumber @xmath6 and the density of particles combined to a single beam splitter , @xmath7 .",

    "+ previous approaches were limited to a single frequency and polarization in a counter propagating geometry . here",
    "we show that it is straightforward to generalize the beam splitter method to allow for multiple frequencies and polarizations .",
    "the field propagating in the @xmath24-direction shall then be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 [ @xmath27 is defined as the component polarized in the direction of @xmath28 [ @xmath29 oscillating with frequency @xmath30 [ @xmath31 .",
    "we want to emphasize that writing the the total field as a sum of linearly polarized fields in   is an arbitrary choice .",
    "none of the upcoming conclusions would change if we chose another orthogonal basis system ( e.g.  circular polarizations ) .",
    "the main assumption of this work is that the particles do not scatter photons from one mode into the other .",
    "as long as this is fulfilled , the beam splitter model can be employed for each component independently .",
    "this assumption is obviously correct if the beam splitters are made of non - birefringent materials as they are used in many optomechanical experiments .",
    "if the beam splitters are assumed to be single atoms one has to take additional care as these typically have tensor polarizabilities . in this case one would choose counterpropagating circular polarized waves in equation   because the two modes then address different atomic transitions .",
    "if we additionally assume sufficiently large detuning for each field , we can also neglect mixing due to spontaneous emissions into other zeeman - levels .",
    "the polarizability then loses all spin and polarization dependencies resulting in a scalar quantity    this is why the coupling parameter @xmath32 introduced in equation   is proportional to a linear atomic polarizability and the wavenumber . for a generalization of the beam splitter method to multi - level atoms with tensor polarizability",

    "we will assume that the atomic polarizability @xmath5 is the same for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , hence @xmath35 .",
    "of course , a more realistic scenario is easily possible within our framework but it would add unnecessary complexity here .",
    "our central goal is the study of multiple scattering dynamics and not the effect of optical pumping and polarization gradients .",
    "+ in the following chapters we will study how the introduction of different frequency fields provides new prospects to manipulate arrays of particles , ranging from equidistant lattices to individually tuned inter - particle distances as well as the design and control of motional couplings .",
    "in this section we explore forces and dynamics of a 1d lattice geometry modelled by a chain of beam splitters at distances @xmath36 irradiated from both sides by light with orthogonal polarizations ( @xmath28 and @xmath37 ) and possibly distinct frequencies ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , cf .",
    "a. in contrast to a standard optical lattice setup as treated before  @xcite no a priori intensity modulation due to wave interference is present and we start with a fully translation invariant field configuration .",
    "hence the light field itself does not prescribe any local ordering and only multiple light scattering from the particles themselves creates local trapping forces .",
    "due to the translation invariance of the setup no stable particle configuration can be expected .",
    "however , the coupled particle field dynamics still induce relative order .",
    "hence our central goal is to find conditions , when the light forces induced by two non  interfering beams are nevertheless sufficient to obtain stationary stable particle arrays and how this spontaneous crystal formation arises .",
    "to get some first insight , we start with the simplest nontrivial example of two beam splitters at a distance @xmath40 .",
    "the intensities from the left and right beam are given as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "here we chose the convention that all variables with index @xmath43 correspond to light polarized in direction of @xmath28 which is injected from the left ( negative @xmath44 axis ) and index @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath37 polarized light injected from the right .",
    "the individual beam splitters are counted from left to right with integer indices , hence , for example @xmath46 is the @xmath47-amplitude of the light field polarized parallel to @xmath37 at the second beam splitter , cf .  .",
    "using   and   to compute the fields for any given distance @xmath48 , it is straightforward to obtain the total force on each beam splitter by simply adding the forces generated by the light in each polarization , i.e.  @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the individual forces @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are obtained from  .    despite the simple physical situation the corresponding general analytic solution already is rather unhandy .",
    "thus we first restrict ourselves to real valued @xmath32 neglecting absorption in the beam splitter or equivalently neglecting spontaneous emission in an atom fibre system . assuming small values of @xmath32 and dropping terms of @xmath55 and higher",
    ", we then find the following approximate formulas for the force on the two particles : @xmath56     for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "for equal intensity @xmath59 and frequency ( blue curves ) the two forces add to zero and vanish at distances @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "for asymmetric intensities @xmath62 ( red curves ) we find distances with equal forces @xmath63 but a net center of mass force remains .",
    "the black curve shows a similar behaviour occurring for different wavenumbers @xmath64 of same power @xmath65 .",

    ", the system can still exhibit centre of mass motion but the particles keep a constant distance . from   and",
    "we see that a stable configuration in the special case of equal wavenumbers , @xmath71 requires @xmath72 independent of the injected laser intensities , which just appear as a multiplicative factor , this corresponds to a pair distance @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . here the solutions for odd  @xmath75 correspond to a stable configuration , while even  @xmath75 leads to unstable behaviour . as numerical example",
    "we plot the full distance dependent forces for three typical sets of parameters in , where stationary distances of equal force can be read of the intersection points .",
    "if these occur at zero force , the centre of mass is stationary as well . for small @xmath32 these distances of zero force on each particle",
    "can be approximated by @xmath76 \\ \\ \\ & n_1 \\in \\mathbb{z}\\label{null1},\\\\ \\fl d_2^{\\pm}=&\\frac{1}{k_z}\\left[\\arccos \\left ( \\pm \\frac{1}{2k_z}\\sqrt { \\frac{k_y^2 i_y+k_z^2 i_z}{i_z- \\zeta^2\\ , ( i_y - i_z ) } } \\right)+n_2 \\pi\\right ] \\ \\ \\ & n_2 \\in \\mathbb{z}. \\label{null2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] conditions   and   imply @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",

    "in general , such solutions can only be determined numerically and are not guaranteed to exist for every set of parameters . in  [ int ]",
    "we show that the line of argument can also be reversed and one can calculate the intensity ratios and wavenumbers needed to obtain a stable configuration for a desired distance @xmath48 .",
    "this allows precise distance control of the particles via intensities and frequencies .",

    "generally a numerical evaluation requires very little effort and can be easily performed for large parameter ranges . despite the fact that there is no externally prescribed order , the particles mostly tend to arrange at configurations with stationary distance .      in principle , determining stationary states for a larger number of beam splitters is straightforward by first solving   and   for the fields and using these to calculate the forces",

    "weakly coupled to the standing wave field will usually have little effect on the other trapped particles .",
    "but after adding a perturbative field with carefully chosen parameters , this oscillation can be transferred to the other particles , forcing them to move along .",
    "note that due to the fact that the additional perturbation ( coupling ) field is imposed from only one side , this coupling effect is not symmetric and excitations can flow in a desired direction .",
    "for example , a perturbing field entering from the left hand side will maximally transfer the motion of the rightmost beam splitter .",
    "this setup allows one to correlate the motion of particles and can even be used as a channel to transfer e.g.  quantum information through the lattice , very much like phonons in ion crystals .    .",
    "we used @xmath57 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the rightmost beam splitter is displaced from the equilibrium position at @xmath163 , resulting in a damped oszillation ( damping parameter @xmath167 ) .",
    "the black curves show the resulting dynamics for @xmath174 .",
    "the green ( @xmath175 ) , blue ( @xmath176 ) and red ( @xmath177 ) curves show the dynamics if the coupling field is switched on .",
    "note the resonant coupling between @xmath178 and @xmath179 . ]",
    "we have shown that even in the case of non - interfering counter propagating light fields of different polarization and frequency , stable lattice configurations of particles held in space by multiple coherent scattering are possible .",
    "in contrast to conventional optical lattices the light here plays a decisive dynamical role as multiple scattering is essential to form and stabilize the structure .",
    "compared to prescribed optical lattices the physics is much closer to the case of solids , where lattice dynamics in form of phonons not only keeps the atoms in place but also mediates long range interactions .",
    "interestingly in conventional optical lattices such interactions can be tailored by adding additional coupling fields of suitable frequency and polarization . while we have performed our calculations only for 1d geometries , where a semi - analytic scattering approach can be used",
    ", similar effects should be present in 3d geometries as well",
    ".    in general for very far detuned optical fields these effects will be rather small but their importance will grow with the size of the lattice as well as in transversally confined fields .",
    "particularly strong effects can be expected in fields guided by nano optical devices such as nano fibres or hollow core fibres . here even for a few particles strong interactions can be expected .    in this work",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the bichromatic case for sake of simplicity .",
    "nevertheless one can expect even more complex dynamics for an increasing number of input fields as the forces show a more complex distance dependence .",
    "note that here we have ignored any internal optical resonances of the particles .",
    "working close to such resonances certainly should strongly increase the effects but also will complicate the analysis .",
    "let us finally mention here that the system not necessarily requires a fixed set of beam splitters as a starting point .",
    "as an alternative we can consider each beam splitter to be formed by a small sub ensemble of atoms in a 1d beam configuration , as it has been proposed before  @xcite . in our case of noninterfering counterpropagaing beams , one can expect that under suitable conditions the cold atoms arrange in small groups forming at local field intensity maxima  @xcite .",
    "groups of atoms at certain spatial sites then commonly form beam splitters shaping a self consistent lattice structure .",
    "in contrast to conventional lattices , backaction of the particles onto the fields is an essential part of the dynamics and the field thus strongly mediates collective interactions .",
    "light scattering on one end of the lattice influences the lattice depth at the other end , which opens a completely new branch of ultracold atom optical lattice physics .",
    "note that also atoms trapped in optical resonator fields  @xcite exhibit similar dynamical coupling effects but in that case the backaction is strongly restricted by the resonator geometry limiting the available interaction wavenumbers .",

    "in section  [ two ] we saw that distances with vanishing force on both beam splitters , leading to a stable or trapped configuration for given intensity ratios and wavenumbers for the special case @xmath71 require equal intensity from left and right . if we reverse the line of argument and ask for intensity ratios and wavenumbers where the two beam splitters can be trapped at a given distance @xmath48 , the result allows us to study the full system , i.e.  different polarizations _ and _ frequencies . in this case precise distance control is possible .    first we need to find the zeros of   and   with respect to @xmath82 .",

    "the associated intensity ratio can be calculated via   or  .",
    "obviously there exists a wide range of parameters which allow stable and trapped configurations of beam splitters in multicolour light beams with orthogonal polarizations ( or sufficiently different wavenumbers ) .",
    "in section  [ two ] we calculate the equations of motion for two beam splitters in a standing wave geometry perturbed by an additional field with orthogonal polarization . for that purpose",
    "we use linearized forces  ,  ,   and  . here",
    "we want to show how this linearization is done and how the constants @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 can be calculated .",
    "the force @xmath189 depends only on the positions @xmath177 and @xmath176 of the two beam splitters . replacing these variables via @xmath135 and @xmath136 results in a force dependent on @xmath137 and @xmath190 . assuming small @xmath137 and @xmath191 we perform a 2d taylor approximation to first order resulting in @xmath192 where we defined real constants @xmath193,@xmath194 and @xmath195 which are lengthy expressions depending on the system s parameters .",
    "the same method works for the remaining forces @xmath196 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , where the latter two only depend on the relative distance @xmath191 .",
