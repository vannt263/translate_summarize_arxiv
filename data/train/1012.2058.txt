    "in recent years the theory of quantum phase transitions has been in the focus of very active research.@xcite the quantum phase transitions take place at zero temperature by changing a control parameter and emerge as a result of competing different ground - state phases .",
    "importantly , quantum phase transitions can influence the behavior of systems over a wide range of the phase diagram at nonzero ( sometimes quite large ) temperatures .",
    "exactly solvable quantum models exhibiting a quantum phase transition are notoriously rare .",
    "a well - known example of a solvable model is the spin-1/2 ising chain in a transverse field , where a zero - temperature transition from the ordered quantum ising phase ( small transverse fields ) to the disordered quantum paramagnetic phase ( large transverse fields ) takes place .",
    "this model is often used for illustration of basic concepts in the quantum phase transition theory.@xcite in general , spin-1/2 @xmath1 chains@xcite provide an excellent ground for various statistical mechanics studies since in many cases the calculations can be performed without any approximation . moreover , there are some real - life compounds which can be viewed as realizations of one - dimensional spin-1/2 @xmath1 models.@xcite    quite recently , two other classes of solvable models have been found , namely a two - dimensional kitaev model@xcite and a spin-1/2 @xmath1 chain with multi - site interactions@xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the model belonging to the latter class is of interest in this paper .",
    "this model has an essentially richer ground - state phase diagram as the standard one - dimensional spin-1/2 @xmath1 model .",
    "in particular , it may exhibit several gapless spin - liquid phases and quantum phase transitions between them.@xcite    on the other hand , quantum models with random hamiltonian parameters present another class of models for which an exact solution can not be found easily . a solvable model with diagonal lorentzian disorder",
    "was introduced by lloyd.@xcite later on lloyd s idea was used to study random spin-1/2 @xmath0 chains.@xcite also an extension to correlated off - diagonal lorentzian disorder and its application to spin-1/2 @xmath0 chains was considered , see refs .  .    naturally , the investigation of quantum phase transitions in systems with randomness is a challenging task .",
    "the random transverse - field ising spin chain is known as a tractable model to study effects of quenched randomness on critical behavior.@xcite within the context of random quantum systems exactly solvable models may play an important role . merging together the above",
    "mentioned solvable quantum spin models with three - site interactions and lloyd s model of disorder we present here an exact analysis of a specific random quantum spin model .",
    "in particular , the influence of randomness on the quantum phase transition inherent in the nonrandom spin model can be studied . in the presence of randomness",
    "the quantum phase transition becomes a crossover .",
    "our solution presented below is based on the jordan - wigner transformation of the spin hamiltonian to the hamiltonian of a tight - binding chain of spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hoppings and random ( lorentzian ) on - site energy .",
    "next - nearest - neighbor hopping is a new feature emerging owing to three - site interactions which makes further calculations more involved .",
    "we introduce green functions and find exactly the random - averaged green functions which yield the random - averaged density of states .",
    "we use the obtained density of states to discuss some ground - state and finite - temperature properties of the spin model .",
    "although the random - averaged density of states can be obtained only for a specific probability distribution , the moments of the density of states can be obtained for an arbitrary inhomogeneous spin chain .",
    "these quantities can illustrate some general effects on the properties of the quantum spin chain caused by inhomogeneity and yields thermodynamic quantities in the high - temperature limit .",
    "our exact results allow to illustrate effect of randomness on a quantum phase transition .",
    "in particular we discuss how a quantum critical region may be modified owing to randomness .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next sections we define the spin model under consideration ( sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] ) and calculate the random - averaged density of states which yields thermodynamic quantities ( sec .  [ sec2b ] ) . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we discuss some properties of the spin model at zero and nonzero temperatures .",
    "we illustrate the effect of the introduced disorder for the transverse magnetization , specific heat , and static transverse susceptibility , and put our discussion in a general context of a theory of quantum phase transitions with randomness . in sec .",

    "each spin interacts with spins on nearest - neighboring sites and on next - nearest - neighboring sites .",
