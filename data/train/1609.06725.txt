    "the simple external training field term in hamiltonian reads : h_train&=&_x , y , u(x , y)n_x , y , + u(x , y)&= & u_0(-1)^x ( 0 , )  , [ train ] here @xmath117 is a constant number , and @xmath118 counts the dmrg sweep .",
    "the external potential @xmath119 plays a role as a training field which is gradually reduced during dmrg sweeps . in our calculation , this training term is finally removed after 14 sweeps ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the initial training field in leads to a perfect cdw state which has the lowest energy .",
    "more importantly , via @xmath121 we can even take advantage of those high energy metastable states to study the property of soliton excitations . by slightly changing the form of @xmath119 , we can create different cdw domain walls and study the physics property of soliton excitations associated with them .",
    "we study two types of effective masses of the solitons .",
    "one is the creation energy @xmath122 , which in the context of a relativistic quantum field theory is referred to as the mass .",
    "the second is the dynamical mass @xmath76 , which determines the extent to which the soliton tends to delocalized - specifically , the energy to localize the soliton in a ( large ) box of length @xmath21 is @xmath123 .    for charged solitons",
    ", we can measure their creation energy by creating a pair of solitons with opposite charges . however , their dynamical masses are almost infinite within the present level of computational accuracy because they remain localized even after hundreds of dmrg sweeps .    for spin-1/2 solitons , both their creation energy and dynamical masses are much smaller than the charged ones .",
    "we can measure the dynamical mass of the spin solitons by looking at the energy of two soliton states as a function of system size . as an extended excitation , the interaction between the two solitons need be considered . for small enough @xmath21 , we can write down a perturbative theory in powers of interaction @xmath124 : _ s(l)&=&_s()++ + & & -v^2 m^ * l^-1+where @xmath125 is the creation energy , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath126 are constant .",

    ", we measure the spin - spin correlation functions in a higher accuracy @xmath131 and find a rather long correlation length which is compatible to the system size . as the cylinder size becomes longer , the correlation length increases , as shown in , which supports that the correlation length is restricted by finite system size for the systems we have studied .",

    "<S> , the system forms a period 4 charge density wave ( cdw ) and exhibits spin - charge separation . slightly away from @xmath4 doping we observe several topologically distinct types of solitons with well defined fractionalized quantum numbers . remarkably , given the absence of any obvious small parameter , the effective masses of the emergent solitons differ by several orders of magnitude .    * </S>",
    "<S> introduction : * as a paradigm for the description of high temperature superconductors@xcite , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , and the closely related hubbard model have been studied extensively by many different numerical methods and are thought to possess a rich phase diagram@xcite . in most of these studies , </S>",
    "<S> the system is taken to be oriented parallel to the primitive lattice vectors of the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> however , in attempting to extrapolate the results to the thermodynamic limit in 2d , it is also useful to study ladders with different geometries@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a diagonal cylinder , rotated by @xmath2 relative to the primitive lattice directions of the sort shown in , has several advantages over the usual one . </S>",
    "<S> for example , since a mirror symmetry along the unit cell diagonal is preserved , it is possible to make sharp distinctions between states whose signatures on a regular ladder would be identical  for instance , one can distinguish @xmath5-wave superconductivity from @xmath6-wave superconductivity and vertical `` stripe '' ( unidirectional cdw ) order from `` checkerboard '' ( bidirectional cdw ) order , and a nematic phase would correspond to a phase that spontaneously breaks this mirror symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while on usual ladders of width larger than 2-legs , there is a clear tendency for stripe order to come at the expense of long - range superconducting coherence , on diagonal cylinders of appropriate width , cdw order resembling the stripes on a barber pole can involve infinite length stripes , which might therefore compete less strongly with superconducting coherence .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first results of a planned extensive dmrg@xcite study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on diagonal ladders . </S>",
    "<S> although our principle interest in this model concerns the extrapolation to 2d , it is also of interest in the context of multi - component 1d systems . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the results concerning the 2-leg cylinder near @xmath3 doping are already interesting from this 1d perspective .            at precisely @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , the system exhibits an interesting commensurate cdw with long - range order . while the period of the density wave order is 4 lattice constants , the period 2 `` harmonic '' is highly dominant and the period 4 `` fundamental '' is extremely weak . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the excitation spectrum , in contrast to the usual 2-leg ladder , this diagonal ladder exhibits clear spin - charge separation . indeed , multiple types of fractionalized soliton excitations arise with different topological characters and associated with different ( fractional ) quantum numbers , as presented in table [ table1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these solitons are somewhat analogous to the solitons that arise in the mean - field solution of the electron - phonon ( commensurate peierls ) problem@xcite , but here they arise directly from the strong electronic correlations . in particular , we identify two flavors of solitons  one is a highly - local charge excitation with a large creation energy , while the other is an extended spin excitation ( spinon ) with a creation energy that is at least several orders smaller .    * </S>",

    "<S> for convenience , we label each site by its location @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ranges from 1 to 2 designating the legs and @xmath20 from 1 to @xmath21 denoting the position of rungs . in our dmrg simulations of this model , </S>",
    "<S> we keep up to 3000 states in the dmrg block and sweep around 30 times such that the truncation error @xmath22 is at most @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that , besides the global symmetries such as the mirror symmetry along diagonal bonds , the hamiltonian on the diagonal two - leg cylinder exhibits a local symmetry : exchanging the two sites on any rung preserves the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> since this local site - exchange symmetry on any rung is equivalent to a @xmath24 gauge symmetry , the ground states can not spontaneously break this symmetry due to the elitzur s theorem@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 . among other things , this precludes the existence of a nematic phase ; this peculiar local symmetry is not a general feature of wider diagonal ladders or cylinders .    </S>",
    "<S> * dmrg results at @xmath3 : * as usual , the doping level of the system away from the half - filling is defined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is total number of sites . </S>",
    "<S> we perform large - scale dmrg simulations to study the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on the diagonal two - leg cylinder with open boundary conditions along the leg direction , we adopt a canonical value of @xmath30 , and for present purposes we focus on the doping around @xmath3 . since all correlation functions on the legs are exactly same we show numerical results only on the leg @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the diagonal cylinder at finite doping has many delicate metastable states as shown previously@xcite such that its ground states and low energy excitations have not previously been obtained . in order to sort out the lowest energy states by dmrg simulation </S>",

    "<S> the ground - state charge density profile of a @xmath32 cylinder with @xmath33 holes is shown in ( a ) . although the average value of @xmath20 differs slightly from 1/4 , deep in the bulk ( _ i.e. _ far from the open boundary ) @xmath3 , as discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ground state of the system exhibits commensurate period 4 cdw , with a periodic pattern of sites of the form @xmath34 , as clearly shown in the zoomed in region in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the density on the @xmath35 and the average of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 type sites , @xmath38/2 $ ] , is an order of magnitude larger than the difference between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 type sites , @xmath39 . to understand the significance of this , note that in the limit @xmath40 , the cdw would have period 2 ; in fourier transform , this means the `` fundamental '' period 4 mode has a small amplitude @xmath41 while the period 2 first harmonic has a large magnitude @xmath42 . to obtain a quantitative estimate valid in the thermodynamic limit , we compute @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 with various @xmath46 and then plot the results as a function of @xmath47 . as shown in ( c ) and ( d ) , both density differences vary linearly with @xmath47 and approach finite values in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state always lies in the spin 0 sector . however , although , as we discuss below , there are theoretical reasons to expect a spin - gap , if such a gap exists it is exceedingly small .    </S>",
    "<S> * solitons in the lg effective field theory : * as it is an aid to intuition , we can express the cdw in terms of the ground - state configuration of a pair of complex scalar fields , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , representing the two harmonics of the density wave : ( x)=|+ + where @xmath52 is the average density , and the four symmetry related ground - states correspond to @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 , 1 , 2 , and 3 . in terms of these fields , we could write an effective landau - ginzburg lagrangian of the form [ _ 1,_2]&&=_1[_1]+_2[_2 ] - + & & --_12 +  where @xmath57 are of the usual form as for an incommensurate cdw , and the terms proportional to @xmath58 produce the commensurate lock - in to the lattice . the term proportional to @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> locks the relative phase of the two harmonics , and since it is linear in @xmath60 , its presence implies that in any state with non - zero @xmath61 there will necessarily be an induced ( possibly small ) harmonic , @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the only really unusual feature here is that the parameters which enter @xmath57 are such that the ground - state magnitude of @xmath60 is , in fact , much larger than @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> topological solitons ( domain walls ) with fractional quantum number appear as low energy excitations in peierls systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , we find stable topological solitons which carry different ( fractional ) quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we expect 3 distinct domain walls which can be characterized by the phase change @xmath62 ( subject to the constraint @xmath63 ) , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ wall ] . from a topological perspective </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath64 and @xmath65 domain walls can be viewed as bound - states of , respectively , two and three @xmath66 domain walls .    </S>",
    "<S> * solitons from dmrg : * we induce soliton states by adding holes or electrons , by flipping spins , or by applying ( and then removing ) suitable training fields .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(1 ) the ground state density and spin profile in the sector of @xmath67 are shown in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the changes relative to the ground - state are spread out . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is apparent that the spin - density is doubly peaked , with spin 1/2 in each half of the system , consistent with the existence of two delocalized spin 1/2 particles . </S>",
    "<S> manifestly , these particles are neutral . moreover , comparing cdw pattern in the middle and at the boundaries of the cylinder , we find a @xmath68 phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the spin 1 ground - state consists of two delocalized neutral spin-@xmath69 solitons with @xmath70 , which we label as @xmath71 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ wall](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton creation energy , @xmath72 , is expected to approach half of the spin gap , @xmath73 in the limit @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see , @xmath73 is sufficiently small , @xmath75 , that we can not determine its @xmath74 value from even the largest system sizes we have studied . the dynamical mass @xmath76 refers to the zero - point energy to confine a soliton to a region of size @xmath21 according to @xmath77 . as explained in the supplemental material , we extract the dynamical mass of spin-@xmath69 soliton @xmath78 in the small @xmath21 region .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) a metastable excited state with @xmath79 can be prepared by applying a proper training field in the initial dmrg simulation , with the result shown in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it contains charge @xmath80 and spin-0 solitons ( @xmath81 ) with @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the solitons are sufficiently `` heavy '' that they remain localized for as many dmrg iterations as we can execute , which also means the dynamical mass of charged solitons @xmath82 is effectively infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the creation energy of a pair of charge @xmath80 solitons is @xmath83 , which is much larger than @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> note there is no particle - hole symmetry relating the solitons with opposite charge .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(3 ) the addition of two electrons with @xmath79 to the `` undoped '' system ( with @xmath3 ) results in various configurations , depending on the form of the initial training fields . in ( c ) , two @xmath84 solitons identical to the left soliton in ( b ) are clearly seen . in ( d ) , the right soliton has been broken into two @xmath85 solitons , each associated with a @xmath66 domain wall ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ wall](d ) ) . by comparing the energies of the states in ( c ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) , we obtain @xmath86 . similarly , by adding two holes we can obtain the soliton configurations shown in ( e ) and ( f ) . in ( f ) , there are two charge @xmath87 solitons associated with the @xmath88 domain walls . by comparing energies in ( e ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) , we obtain @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> a charge @xmath90 soliton has much lower creation energy than a pair of @xmath87 solitons .    </S>",
    "<S> * spinon excitation : * as mentioned above , the spin gap at @xmath3 doping is extremely small , which is a novel feature worth further understanding . </S>",
    "<S> because of the period 4 cdw ordering , the enlarged unit cell now has 8 sites and consequently 6 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , consistent with haldane s conjecture , we should expect a finite spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> for finite @xmath21 , @xmath73 is always larger than @xmath91 , but by extrapolation we would infer that @xmath92 as @xmath74 , as shown in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a small enough value that it could be consistent with @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , it would imply a spin - correlation length , @xmath94 , which is larger than any accessible system size , making the quantitative aspect of this estimate unreliable . at an intuitive level , </S>",
    "<S> the small gap is related to the small value of the principle harmonic of the cdw ; in the limit @xmath95 , the cdw has period 2 with 3 electrons per unit cell , and hence ( presumably ) no spin - gap .    to flesh out this intuition </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the same problem in the context of a `` bosonized '' effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the non - interacting band structure consists of a flat band and a dispersing band , as shown in ( b ) . for @xmath3 , the lower dispersive band </S>",
    "<S> is partially filled with @xmath96 , while the flat band is empty . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by adiabatic continuity , we expect that the low energy fermionic modes can be expressed in terms of two bosonic fields @xmath97 and their duals , @xmath98 : _ , ( x ) = n_e^ik_f x , where @xmath99 is the polarization of the spin and @xmath100 for right and left moving fermions . the period 2 and 4 cdw orders come from the expectation value of @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively : _ </S>",
    "<S> 4k_f & & = n_4k_fe^i3xe^i_c , + o_2k_f & & = n_2k_fe^i3x/2e^i_c.[eq5 ] because of the @xmath103 $ ] factor in , ordering of @xmath104 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ a period 4 cdw , requires condensing @xmath105 , which gives rise to a finite spin gap @xmath106 . to obtain an estimate of the expected gap magnitude </S>",
    "<S> , we invoke the expected scaling relations @xmath107 ^ 4 $ ] and @xmath108 \\rangle \\sim \\sqrt{\\delta_s/\\omega } $ ] where @xmath109 is a uv cutoff to obtain _ </S>",
    "<S> s~. [ spingap ] by further identifying @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , we estimate @xmath113 which is small and remarkably consistent with the estimate obtained from finite - size scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> * concluding remarks : * from both numerical results and bosonization analysis , we infer that the creation energy of the spinon @xmath72 is extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> this is a quite surprising result ; the creation energies of the charged solitons are three or four orders of magnitude larger . without any fine tuning or small parameters in the microscopic model , </S>",
    "<S> a striking mass hierarchy emerges in the low energy physics of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on the diagonal two - leg cylinder !    </S>",
    "<S> we have also carried out similar dmrg studies for values of @xmath114 other than 1/3 , including @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> we find qualitatively similar results both for the fractional quantum numbers of the solitons at @xmath3 and the mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> for other values of @xmath20 , still more complicated forms of solitons arise . a systematic study of the phase diagram as a function of both @xmath114 and @xmath20 </S>",
