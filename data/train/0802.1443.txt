    "heavy - ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies offer the possibility to study the behavior of nuclear matter at high density and/or temperature where one expects the formation of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . a valuable tool to explore the early stage of heavy - ion collisions are electromagnetic probes .",
    "they are not subject to the strong interaction and can freely escape the surrounding hadronic medium .",
    "ceres / na45 ( cherenkov ring electron spectrometer ) is the only experiment at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) dedicated to the study of e@xmath3e@xmath4 - 0.2em - pairs produced in and collisions in the low mass range of @xmath5 .",
    "it was installed in 1990 at the h8 beam line of the sps north area and started its operation in 1991 .",
    "systematic studies have been done using interactions in 1992 and proton - induced reactions and in 1993 .",
    "an energy scan of interactions has been performed in beam times from 1995 to 2000 .",
    "one of the main achievements of the ceres experiment is the measurement of an enhanced dilepton yield in and collisions as compared to expected contributions from vacuum decays of hadrons  @xcite .    in 1998",
    "the experiment was upgraded with a radial drift time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite in order to significantly improve the mass resolution in the range of the @xmath6-meson from @xmath7 @xcite to @xmath8  @xcite . the additional information from the differential energy loss @xmath9 in the tpc further improved the pion / electron separation capability .",

    "the dilepton invariant mass spectra measured after the experimental upgrade with the tpc allowed for the first time to discriminate between different theoretical approaches  @xcite . finally , the tpc also opened the possibility to study hadronic channels . since then many interesting topics have been addressed like particle multiplicities , elliptic flow , event - by - event fluctuations , particle correlations , and strangeness analyses ( see for example  @xcite ) .    the upgraded ceres spectrometer , as it was used during the heavy - ion runs in 1999 and 2000 ,",

    "the main components of the experiment are two silicon drift detectors ( sdd1 , sdd2 ) for vertex reconstruction , two ring imaging cherenkov counters ( rich1 , rich2 ) for electron identification , and a radial drift time projection chamber ( tpc ) for the measurement of the particle momentum and particle identification .",
    "all detector components of the spectrometer cover full azimuth at polar angles @xmath14 , corresponding to a pseudorapidity range of @xmath15 .",
    "the aim of an improved mass resolution required the addition of a charged particle spectrometer to the existing ceres experiment , consisting of a magnet system and a large volume electron tracking device @xcite .",
    "the tpc technology has been successfully applied for this task in heavy - ion experiments , combining high resolution tracking with large acceptance , low material budget , and reasonable cost .",
    "the new spectrometer system had to preserve the polar angle acceptance and the azimuthal symmetry of the existing experiment .",
    "this led to a radial electric field configuration resulting in the first radial drift tpc ever to be operated .",

    "this design implies crossing electric and magnetic field lines leading to a finite variable lorentz angle of the drifting electrons .",
    "the drift gas mixture ne / co@xmath17 ( 80/20 ) has been found as an optimum with regard to small diffusion coefficients and lorentz angle , sufficient primary ionization , long radiation length , and detector stability . in addition , the maximum drift time should be kept low in order not to compromise the trigger rate without requiring excessively high drift fields .",
    "the tpc was installed downstream of the existing spectrometer , at a distance of @xmath18 from the target system .",
    "a cross - section of the tpc is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldcage ] .",
    "the mechanical stability of the tpc is provided by a massive backplate and an outer cylinder , both in aluminum . the active volume of about @xmath19",

    "it is enclosed by the inner high voltage cylinder at @xmath21 , the 16 readout chambers at @xmath22 , and two @xmath23 kapton foils with thin cu voltage dividers at the front and the end faces .",
    "the active length of the tpc is @xmath24 .",
    "the ionization electrons created along charged particle tracks drift outwards and are detected in the readout chambers , multi wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) with cathode pad - readout .",
    "the tpc is operated in a magnetic field which predominantly deflects charged particles in azimuth , and provides the reconstruction of up to 20 space points along the particle track .",
    "the electric drift field follows a @xmath25-dependence varying between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : efield ] ) . in ne",
    "/ co@xmath20 ( 80/20 ) this corresponds to non - uniform drift velocities between @xmath28 and @xmath29 and a maximum drift time of @xmath30 .",
    "the electric field has a small azimuthal component due to the polygonal outer shape of the tpc and a small longitudinal component at the end caps .",
    "the field cage foils of the tpc are supposed to match the radial drift field at the ends of the drift volume and to provide gas tightness .",
    "this must be achieved at a minimum of material budget and with a mechanically and electrostatically stable structure .",
    "the foils are made of @xmath23 thick kaptoncoated on both sides with 42 copper concentric circular strips .",
    "the copper strips have a thickness of @xmath31 .",
    "they are @xmath32 wide and @xmath33 apart from each other .",
    "the foils are composed of four pieces covering 90 degrees and are supported by 8 stesalit bars of @xmath34 width and thickness .",

    "the copper layer is @xmath35 thick .",
    "the bars are connected to an inner and an outer al ring which are attached to the hv - cylinder and the outer structure ( hamster cage ) , respectively .",

    "two resistor chains are connected to the cylinder on one side and to the ground on the other .",
    "the resistors are regular carbon film resistors .",
    "they are soldered onto the strips of one bar . because the matching field is radial and the strip pitch is constant",
    ", the resistor values must follow a 1/r - dependence .",
    "the resistor values range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the total current in each chain is @xmath41 .",
    "the currents are measured via the voltage drop on the external @xmath42 test resistors in series with the chains .",
    "the bars and the resistors are inside the drift volume .",
    "the resistors in the voltage dividers were chosen such that the strips should ensure a longitudinally homogeneous electric field inside the drift volume . however , it turned out that the resistance of some of the resistors used in the voltage dividers changed with the applied voltage",
    ". this resulted in a distortion of the drift field near the ends of the tpc which produced deviations of up to @xmath43 , as observed with laser tracks .",
    "a three dimensional calculation of the electric field with detailed geometry and appropriately adjusted resistor values accounted for this effect and reduced the track distortions by a factor of 6 .",
    "the electric field calculation was performed using a custom program based on the relaxation method , including the proper knowledge of the ring potentials ( sect .",
    "[ sec : fieldcage ] ) and the leakage of the amplification field through the cathode wire plane of the readout chambers ( sect .",
    "[ sec : fieldconf ] ) .",
    "an example of the potential calculated in the vicinity of the upstream field cage rings is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mymax - a ] .",
    "the calculation was performed for half of a chamber ( corresponding to @xmath44 ) assuming chamber symmetry .",
    "the code heavily exploited the symmetries of the detector and thus allowed to calculate a potential map within several hours running time on a personal computer .",
    "this would be impossible using a standard field computation tool like @xcite .",
    "indeed , the drift field obtained by running this package for 6 days was still exhibiting non - physical inhomogeneities on the level of several percent .      after accounting for the variation of the field cage resistors with the voltage the deviations of the reconstructed laser tracks from a straight line went down from @xmath43 to @xmath45 .",
    "the final tuning was done by adding a phenomenological correction potential calculated requiring @xmath46 at the inner cylinder and the readout chambers , with the shape optimized to straighten the laser tracks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mymax - c ] ) .      the three - dimensional field calculation , needed to account at the same time for the polygonal readout chamber configuration ( @xmath47 ) and for the track curvature in @xmath48 , was done for performance reasons only for a 11.25@xmath49 slice in @xmath6 of the tpc , i.e. for half a readout chamber . the azimuthal symmetry , however , is broken by slight misalignments of the 16 chambers . to account for this ,",
    "a number of two - dimensional potential calculations @xmath50 was performed for a complete set of 16 chambers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mymax2d - a ] ) , and then repeated with one of the chambers being slightly displaced in @xmath16 or tilted in @xmath16 vs. @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mymax2d - b ] ) .",
    "the correction potentials , defined as the difference between a two - dimensional calculation for a displaced ( or tilted ) and a perfectly aligned chamber @xmath51 were then added to the three - dimensional calculations , separately for each chamber and each of the 20 @xmath52-planes .",
    "the displacements in @xmath16 and the tilts in @xmath53 were chosen such as to move the reconstructed position of the high voltage cylinder as close as possible to the nominal @xmath21 ( maximum measured deviation of @xmath54 ) .",
    "the high voltage cylinder is visible in the data either via the electrons knocked out from aluminum by the laser light or as the edge in the radial distribution of hits in physics events .",
    "one should note that displacing a chamber affects the reconstructed cylinder position in two ways : via the modified field and via the change in the path length .",
    "both mechanisms were studied separately and in combination . displacing a chamber by @xmath55 without changing the field shifts the reconstructed cylinder by @xmath56 ( this is because the drift velocity close to the cylinder is three times higher than at the chamber ) . using a field calculated with a chamber displaced by @xmath55 but keeping the path length unchanged also gives a @xmath56 shift .",
    "the combination of the two ( as expected in a real case ) gives a @xmath57 apparent shift .",
    "displacements and tilts by up to @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , are needed to get the reconstructed cylinder to its nominal position and shape .",
    "[ fig : cylinder_before_b ] and [ fig : cylinder_after_b ] show the hv - cylinder position reconstructed before and after applying this correction , respectively .",
    "the data in the figures have been corrected for the pad - to - pad trace length variations ( sect .",
    "[ sec : padtopad ] ) .",
    "the tpc is operated inside an inhomogeneous magnetic field generated by two solenoidal coils with opposite sense currents of up to @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig : bfield ] shows a calculation of the magnetic    field using the cern poisson package @xcite . in the region between the two coils",
    "a field strength of @xmath61 is reached .",
    "particles are deflected primarily in azimuthal direction .",
    "the field integral is @xmath62 at @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "the magnetic fringe field outside the tpc drops off rapidly and is negligible at the position of the mirror of the rich2 detector of the ceres spectrometer .",
    "the magnetic field was mapped ( in presence of all tpc support structures ) prior to installation of the tpc in the experimental area .",
    "the measurements correspond to the calculations with deviations from azimuthal symmetry at the percent level .",
    "these deviations are included in the analysis as corrections to the nominal field map @xcite .",
    "the commonly used ar / ch@xmath66 ( @xmath67/@xmath68 ) mixture was excluded as counting gas for its large lorentz angles ( @xmath69 in the relevant field range ) , diffusion coefficients , and multiple scattering angle . in good approximation ,",
    "the width of the angular distribution caused by multiple scattering is given by @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the momentum in @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the velocity , @xmath74 is the charge number of the traversing particle , and @xmath75 is the thickness of the medium in units of its radiation length .",
    "thus , a counting gas with large radiation length minimizes the influence of multiple scattering . in terms of multiple scattering , ne - based gas mixtures are preferable to ar - based mixtures .",
    "the drift velocity of the ionization electrons in the gas as derived from the langevin equation can be written as a function of the electric field @xmath76 and the magnetic field @xmath77 : @xmath78 in this equation @xmath79 is the mean time between two collisions . the cyclotron frequency @xmath80 is given by : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the electron mobility .",
    "the mobility is a function of the electric field , gas composition , pressure , and temperature .",
    "the outlined considerations were the baseline for detailed simulations with the package magboltz @xcite .",
    "for a large number of gas mixtures the drift velocity , lorentz angle , longitudinal , and transverse diffusion coefficients were calculated as a function of the electric field for a given magnetic field at a fixed angle .",
    "the calculations cover magnetic fields from @xmath83 to @xmath61 at angles between @xmath84 and @xmath85 with respect to the electric field .",
    "[ fig : gasopt ] shows results for various gas mixtures for the most disadvantageous case of a magnetic field of @xmath61 perpendicular to the electric field @xcite .",
    "the gas mixtures under considerations are ne , he and ar / he with admixtures of @xmath68 to @xmath86 co@xmath17 . also shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : gasopt ] are the diffusion coefficients normalized to the square root of the number of primary electrons @xmath87 , since this ratio is the relevant quantity for the position resolution at the readout chamber .",
    "another limiting factor is the rate of clean interaction at a beam rate of @xmath88/s ( @xmath89/burst ) .",
    "this means that no further interaction should occur within a time window of twice the maximum drift time .",
    "a maximum drift time of @xmath90 makes ne / co@xmath17 ( @xmath67/@xmath68 ) the preferred solution .",
    "he / ar / co@xmath17 ( @xmath91/@xmath91/@xmath68 ) has the advantage of lower cost and yields , in terms of resolution , very similar performance but has a maximum drift time of @xmath92 .",
    "the final choice of @xmath93 ne and @xmath86 co@xmath17 is a compromise between an optimum resolution and an acceptable loss of primary electrons , both of which are increasing with the fraction of co@xmath17 .",
    "the latter is caused by the attachment of free electrons to oxygen impurities in the counting gas , with subsequent deexcitation through collisions with co@xmath17 molecules ( sect .",
    "[ sec : eattach ] ) .",
    "in addition , a higher concentration of quencher allows for a safer operation against glow discharges of ne - based gas mixtures at relatively high gains . on the other hand ,",
    "co@xmath17-based mixtures are very sensitive to temperature and pressure fluctuations .      in order to minimize the overall ne consumption the gas system for the ceres tpc was designed as a closed loop circuit .",
    "the schematic is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gassystem ] .",
    "the majority of the gas mixture recirculates through the gas system cleaning part and the tpc . during a normal run small amounts of fresh gas ( @xmath94 ) are replaced .",
    "the gas circulation rate is about @xmath95 , corresponding to about @xmath96 volume exchange per hour .",
    "the gas system contains two compressors with a capacity of @xmath97 each , located at the exit of the tpc .",
    "the recirculating gas flows through a buffer vessel and subsequently through one of two cartridges , filled with a copper catalyzer , to remove oxygen and water vapor .",
    "the purity and composition of the gas is monitored using oxygen , water , and co@xmath17 analyzers .",
    "ambient pressure fluctuations are compensated for by filling or emptying gas from the buffer vessel , thus keeping a constant overpressure in the tpc .",
    "the pressure in the tpc is regulated at about @xmath98 above the atmospheric pressure .",
    "the operation of the system is controlled by a programmable logic controller ( plc ) .",
    "a safety bubbler is installed at the detector to prevent any under- or overpressure at the tpc higher than @xmath99 , in particular during power failures .",
    "the gas system can be operated either in an open system configuration for purging with co@xmath17 or in a special mode foreseen to bring the tpc to the correct mixture of ne / co@xmath17 filling . the latter is achieved with two parallel cartridges containing 2.7 kg of molecular sieve 13x each to absorb co@xmath17 .",
    "the cartridges are equipped with heating and cooling devices .",
    "a pump is connected to the output of the cartridges to vent the absorbed co@xmath17 . during the filling process",
    "the gas of the tpc is passed through one of the cartridges and the co@xmath17 is trapped .",
    "at the same rate ne gas is injected into the system . since ne",
    "is not trapped the amount of ne in the mixture increases with time .",
    "once the cartridge is saturated with co@xmath17 , the system changes automatically to the second cartridge and the first one is regenerated .",
    "regeneration is achieved by heating the cartridge to 220@xmath100c while purging it with ar and pumping the liberated co@xmath17 out of the system .",
    "after 1 hour the cooling line brings the cartridge to ambient temperature and the system switches over to the other cartridge . in this manner ,",
    "no ne is waisted while filling the detector .",
    "a total of 24 passes is necessary to trap @xmath101 of co@xmath17 .",
    "the filling process takes about 50 hours .",
    "the tpc requires a stable operating temperature which was set to @xmath102 .",
    "the sources of temperature variation are the proximity to the rich detectors which are kept at @xmath103 , the magnet , the tpc readout electronics , and the hall environment .",
    "three types of cooling circuits were installed : an insulating screen between the magnet and the tpc , cold screens against the heat from electronic cards , and co@xmath17 circuits .",

    "the water circuits are supplied via a leakless cooling system version 2 ( lcs2 ) @xcite , where the pressure is kept below atmospheric pressure .",
    "all the circuits are remotely controlled by a plc .",
    "individual pid controllers adjust the temperatures .    with this cooling system",
    "the short - term temperature variations could be stabilized to below @xmath106 during data taking periods .",
    "a computer driven system monitors all the parameters that could have an influence on the response of the tpc during the beam time ( fig .  [ fig : slowctrl ] ) .",
    "these parameters include pressure , temperature , composition , oxygen and water content of the drift gas , drift velocity of electrons in the tpc , and the stability of the electric drift field .",
    "the gas monitoring system consists of a personal computer ( pc ) running linux , a 16 channel @xmath107 12-bit analog - to - digital - converter ( adc ) with programmable gain installed in the pc , a 192-bit digital - input - output board ( dio ) , and a 48 channel form c , @xmath108 relay .",
    "the devices measuring the pressure , gas mixture and water content provide a voltage level which is read directly by the adc .",
    "the tpc is equipped with three 16-bit pt100 temperature sensors .",
    "they are supplied with a constant current from an iso-5b32 current input module .",
    "the reading is done sequentially using the relay which is driven by the dio module .",

    "the data are redirected to the linux pc , where they are stored and analyzed .",
    "the electric field stability is monitored by recording the high voltage , the total current through the voltage divider , and the voltage drop through two external resistors of the field cage .",
    "since the drift velocity in first order scales with the electric field , it is convenient to consider the ratio of the two , called electron mobility , in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the knowledge of the mobility for different values of the electric field is essential for understanding drift in a radial field .",
    "seven approximately parallel laser rays in one sector of the tpc , together with the signal from the hv - cylinder ( photoelectric effect in the al ) , were used to determine the electron mobility function .",
    "this was achieved by minimizing radial distances of the reconstructed tpc hits from the expected track positions .",

    "the most noticeable structure extends over groups of 48 pads corresponding to the chambers of the tpc .",
    "the periodic peaks can partly be explained by the sag of the anode wires .",
    "the wires are glued to the edge of a chamber . in between these two fixed points the wires",

    "the hits are charged clusters , i.e. conglomerations of pixels with amplitudes @xmath128 .",
    "it is also possible that several hits overlap in one charged cluster .",
    "the hit finding procedure scans the time - pad pixel grid of each plane to find absolute maxima @xmath129 within each cluster by first searching for local maxima in time direction and subsequently in pad direction @xcite . in cases where the position of an absolute maximum within a cluster is ambiguous ( i.e. several adjacent saturated pixels ) , the amplitude information from neighboring pixels is considered in the decision .    a study based on simulated and real events has shown that the area of deposited charge does not extend over more than five time bins and three pads .",
    "this defines an area of 15 pixels arranged around an absolute maximum within a cluster .",
    "hits containing only one time bin row are discarded .",
    "the same applies for one pad clusters , with the exception of a hit being localized at the edge of a chamber or adjacent to a dead fee - board .    to cope with the problem of overlapping hits ,",

    "the difference between the magboltz monte carlo drift @xcite and the actual drift velocity vector is accounted for with a @xmath52- and @xmath139-dependent correction for the drift velocity component parallel to the electric field and the one parallel to @xmath140 .",
    "the tracking starts in one of the middle planes 5 to 15 where the hit density is lowest @xcite .",

    "the strong inhomogeneity of the magnetic field leads to a less accurate prediction of the fit in the upstream direction for the low momentum ( soft ) tracks .",

    "the search for hits is continued in higher planes in the case of missing hits .",
    "a hit is only assigned to a single track , i.e. the sharing of hits between tracks is not allowed .",

    "the minimum number is limited to in order to reduce the contribution of imperfectly reconstructed or fake tracks .      because of the inhomogeneous magnetic field in the tpc an analytical description of a trajectory is impossible .",
    "this problem is handled by using reference tables for the track fit in the @xmath6-@xmath52 and @xmath16-@xmath52  planes .",

    "the three - parameter fit yields an optimal result for low momentum tracks which often suffer multiple scattering .",
