    "for the analysis of the coupling of bouncing - ball modes to the chaotic sea we use the analogy to systems with a mixed phase space . there the coupling of regular and chaotic modes is caused by dynamical tunneling @xcite , which quantum mechanically connects the classically separated regular and chaotic regions .",

    "however , there is a region surrounding the marginally stable bouncing - ball orbits which acts like a regular island , whose border is energy dependent such that its area semiclassically goes to zero @xcite .",
    "for this situation we apply the fictitious integrable system approach @xcite to predict the couplings of bouncing - ball modes to the chaotic sea . whether this coupling occurs due to dynamical tunneling as in mixed systems , or due to classically allowed transitions , e.g. , through partial barriers , or some other mechanism is an open question that we do not address in this paper .",
    "we first give a brief review of the fictitious integrable system approach @xcite which was previously used to determine regular - to - chaotic tunneling rates in systems with a mixed phase space @xcite .",
    "here it is applied in order to predict couplings of bouncing - ball modes in chaotic billiards .",
    "the main idea of the fictitious integrable system approach is the decomposition of hilbert space into two parts , which correspond to the bouncing - ball modes ( regular subspace ) and to the remaining chaotic modes ( chaotic subspace ) .",
    "such a decomposition can be found by introducing a fictitious integrable system @xmath36 .",
    "this system has to be chosen such that its classical dynamics is integrable and contains the marginally stable bouncing - ball motion of the chaotic billiard .",
    "quantum mechanically , the eigenstates @xmath37 of @xmath36 , @xmath38 , closely resemble the bouncing - ball modes of the chaotic billiard and are used as a basis for the regular subspace .",
    "the regular modes @xmath37 are characterized by two quantum numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath15 describes the quantization along the bouncing - ball orbits and @xmath16 perpendicular to them .",
    "they localize on quantizing tori of @xmath36 , and decay beyond .",
    "this decay is the decisive property of @xmath37 , which have no chaotic admixture , in contrast to bouncing - ball modes in a chaotic billiard .",
    "two choices for the system @xmath36 will be discussed in sec .",

    "the coupling matrix element of one regular mode @xmath37 and a chaotic mode @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 the disadvantage of these couplings @xmath41 is their dependence on the size of the chaotic region via the normalization of the chaotic modes @xmath39 .",
    "a better suited quantity , that is not affected by such changes , is the decay rate @xmath31 . under variation of the billiard boundary far away from the rectangular bouncing - ball region it is unique for each regular state @xmath37 . from the couplings",
    "@xmath41 the decay rate is obtained with fermi s golden rule @xmath42 here we average over the modulus squared of the fluctuating coupling matrix elements @xmath41 of one particular regular mode and different chaotic modes of similar energy .",
    "the chaotic density of states is approximated by the leading weyl term @xmath43 , in which @xmath44 denotes the area of the billiard .        to illustrate the decay rates @xmath31 one may consider a regular state @xmath37 concentrating close to the marginally stable bouncing - ball orbits which is coupled to a continuum of chaotic states .",
    "its decay @xmath32@xmath45 is characterized by the rate @xmath46 . for systems with a finite phase space",
    "this exponential decay occurs at most up to the heisenberg time @xmath47 , where @xmath12 is the mean level spacing .",
    "alternatively , the decay rates are the inverse of the lifetimes of resonances in a corresponding open system , which can be obtained , e.g. , by adding an absorbing region in the chaotic component of phase space far away from the bouncing - ball region .      in the following we predict decay rates @xmath31 of bouncing - ball modes with eqs .   and",
    "for this we construct a fictitious integrable system @xmath36 , whose eigenstates @xmath37 resemble the bouncing - ball modes of the chaotic billiard .",
    "two approaches will be presented below .",
    "the first uses adiabatic modes , which approximate the bouncing - ball modes quite well , but have to be evaluated numerically .",
    "the second approach uses modes of the rectangular billiard , which are given analytically , but turn out to be a good approximation for the bouncing - ball modes of the cosine billiard only .      in order to construct modes which approximate the bouncing - ball modes of a billiard we use the adiabatic separation ansatz @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the height of the billiard at @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "equation   is close to a separation ansatz but @xmath53 weakly depends on @xmath51 in order to satisfy the dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath54 .",
    "the function @xmath53 accounts for the quantization of the fast bouncing - ball motion in the @xmath55 direction .",
    "the slow motion in the @xmath51 direction is quantized by demanding that @xmath56 fulfills the 1d schrdinger equation @xcite , @xmath57 which we solve numerically . here",
    "the effective potential is @xmath58 with @xmath59 and the eigenvalues are denoted by @xmath60 . from @xmath60",
    "one obtains approximate eigenvalues of the bouncing - ball modes @xmath61 .",
    "the ansatz , eq .  , exactly satisfies the schrdinger equation inside the rectangular region of the billiard . outside of the rectangular region",
    "this is only approximately true .",
    "there the functions @xmath62 will eventually decay exponentially , as the effective potential @xmath58 becomes very steep for large @xmath15 .",
    "the adiabatic modes show good agreement to the bouncing - ball modes of the stadium and the cosine billiard if @xmath63 ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : tunnel : quasimodes : comb](a)-[fig : tunnel : quasimodes : comb](d ) .",
    "in particular the bouncing - ball modes are well reproduced in the region @xmath64 , where the rectangular region ends .",
    "note that small deviations arise for modes with large @xmath16 , in particular for the stadium billiard ( not shown ) .",
    "however , these modes strongly couple to chaotic modes and thus do not contribute to the counting function in sec .",

    "the choice @xmath74 for the sum ensures that @xmath70 projects onto the phase - space component with @xmath75 , which excludes the bouncing - ball region but also parts of the surrounding chaotic region . this choice will underestimate the decay rates slightly",
