    "astronomical observation on the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) anisotropy @xcite , supernova type ia(snia ) @xcite and sloan digital sky survey(sdss ) @xcite converge on that our universe is spatially flat , with about seventy percent of the total density resulting from dark energy that has an equation of state @xmath0 and drives the accelerating expansion of the universe which began at a redshift of order one - half . the origin of the dark energy remains elusive from the point of view of general relativity and standard particle physics .",
    "several candidates to represent dark energy have been suggested and confronted with observation : cosmological constant , quintessence with a single field @xcite or with n coupled field @xcite , phantom field with canonical @xcite or born - infield type lagrangian @xcite , k - essence @xcite and generalized chaplygin gas(gcg ) @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the most typical ones are cosmological constant and quintessence which has caught much attention ever since its invention .",
    "the idea of inflation is legitimately regarded as an great advancement of modern cosmology : it solves the horizon , flatness and monopole problem , and it provides a mechanism for the generation of density perturbations needed to seed the formation of structures in the universe . in standard inflationary models ,",
    "the physics lies in the inflation potential .",
    "the underlying dynamics is simply that of a single scalar field rolling in its potential .",
    "this scenario is generically referred to as chaotic inflation in reference to its choice of initial conditions .",
    "this picture is widely favored because of its simplicity and has received by far the most attention to date .",
    "the properties of inflationary models are also tightly constraint by the recent result from the observation .",
    "the standard inflationary @xmath1cdm model provides a good fit to the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy .",
    "peeples and vilenkin proposed and quantitatively analyzed the intriguing idea @xcite that a substantial fraction of the present cosmic energy density could reside in the vacuum potential energy of the scalar field responsible for inflation ( quintessential inflation ) . after that , there were some models to be presented in succession .",
    "however , most of these models involve non - renormalizable , special potentials and these potentials usually do not have a local minimum , making the conventional reheating process unoperative .",
    "on the other hand , the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry is the most elegant solution to the strong cp problem of qcd .",
    "the global @xmath2 is a spontaneously symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "weinberg @xcite and wilczek @xcite pointed out that there is a nambu - goldstone boson , the axion , associated with ssb .",
    "such a global symmetry often arises in supersymmetric and superstring - inspired models .",
    "a priori pq symmetry breaking scale is arbitrary , which can be taken a value between @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 gev . in most axion models pq symmetry",
    "breaking happens at a temperature @xmath5 , when a complex scalar field @xmath6 , which carries @xmath2 charge , develops a vacuum expectation value . at temperatures below @xmath5",
    "the renormalizable potential for @xmath6 is    @xmath7    where @xmath8 .",
    "however , the argument of @xmath9 is left undecided when the @xmath2 has been broken because of @xmath10 is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "the massless @xmath12 degree of freedom is the axion : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the color anomaly of the pq symmetry @xcite .",
    "the axion is massless at @xmath15 , but the axion develops a mass due to instanton effects at low temperatures . in the @xmath16 case ,",
    "the axion mass is easy to concretize by using a potential    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 and the axion develops a mass @xmath19 .",
    "the conception that the modular part of a complex field with pq symmetry may drive inflation is also not new @xcite .",
    "another version of a complex field was proposed as a realistic candidate for inflation @xcite and , separately , for quintessence @xcite in a natural fashion .",
    "the two - axion model has also been suggested for quintessence @xcite or inflation @xcite .",
    "the axion model can also be used for quintessence @xcite and , separately , for inflation @xcite from extra dimensions .",
    "recently , a fascinating model for quintessential inflation has been proposed by rosenfeld and frieman ( rf ) with aid of the axion theory . in their model ,",
    "a renormalizable complex scalar field @xmath6 described by a lagrangian with a @xmath20 symmetry spontaneously broken at a high energy scale @xmath21 gev and explicitly broken by instanton effects at a much lower energy can account for both the early inflationary phase and the recent accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the modular and argument parts of the field @xmath6 were identified with the inflaton and the quintessence fields respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we put the emphasis on the study of the dynamics of rf model with radiation and matter composition .",
    "according to the phase space analysis and numerical calculation , we show that how the modular part of complex field plays the role of the inflaton whereas the argument part is the quintessence field .",
    "phase space methods are particularly useful when the equations of motion are hard to solve analytically for the presence of radiation and dust matter .",
    "in fact , the numerical solutions with random initial conditions are not a satisfying alternative because of these may not reveal all the important properties . therefore , combining the information from the critical points analysis with numerical solutions , one is able to give the complete classification of solutions according to their early - time and late - time behavior . there are stable and unstable critical points for rf model with radiation and dust matter composition .",
    "critical points are always exact constant solution in the context of autonomous dynamical systems .",
    "these points are often the extreme points of the orbits and therefore describe the asymptotic behavior . in our case",
    ", the unstable critical points are corresponding to a de sitter behavior at very first moments of the universe .",
    "the stable critical points are corresponding to the second stage of accelerated expansion began at a redshift @xmath22 and is still operative , which alleviates the fine tuning problem .",
    "the equation of state @xmath23 varies with the cosmic evolution and approaches towards -1 asymptotically showing the existence of a cosmological constant at late times . if the solutions interpolate between critical points they can be divided into heteroclinic orbit and homoclinic orbit . in our case ,",
    "the heteroclinic orbit connects unstable and stable critical points .",
    "the numerical calculation shows that brought the universe back to the usual friedman - robertson - walker expansion , then the second stage of accelerated expansion began at @xmath24 .",
    "for convenience , we investigate firstly the global structure of the dynamical system without radiation and matter .",
    "the equations of motion for rf model are @xmath25 and the einstein equation is    @xmath26    where @xmath27 equals @xmath28 is hubble parameter and @xmath29 . here",
    "we define the energy densities : @xmath30    to gain more insights into the dynamical system , we introduce the new variables @xmath31 then the equations of motion could be reduced to @xmath32 and @xmath27 could be rewritten as    @xmath33^{1/2}\\ ] ]    here we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "before we carry out the numerical study , we would like to analyze the system of equations qualitatively .",
    "the critical point of the autonomous system eqs.([eq : auto1 ] ) is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are defined by @xmath38 respectively .",
    "so one can obtain the critical points : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is any integer .    in order to investigate the stability of these critical points , we can linearize the eqs.([eq : auto1 ] ) about the critical points    @xmath41    here @xmath42 and @xmath43 is short for the right hand sides of eqs.([eq : auto1 ] ) .",
    "then we have the stability matrix @xmath44    @xmath45    the eigenvalues of the stability matrix are    @xmath46 . \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is clear that the critical points are always stable when @xmath40 is even because the real part of all the eigenvalues is negative .",
    "so these critical points correspond to late - time attractor solutions .",
    "when @xmath40 is odd , the fourth eigenvalue in eq.([eigenvalue ] ) is always larger than zero and the corresponding critical points are unstable , which are exact constant solution with de sitter behavior at early - time of the universe .",
    "this is to say that the dynamical system has stable critical points at the minimum of the potential @xmath10 and the minimum of the potential @xmath47 .",
    "next , let s read out the physical implications when the system is at the critical point regime .",
    "the cosmic parameters are    @xmath48    and the equation of state of the complex field is @xmath49 clearly , from eqs.([omega ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , one can find that @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 at the late time attractor .",
    "if we are to search for a realistic model , we must know exactly how the complex scalar field @xmath6 couples to ordinary matter . for convenience , we assume that coupling is very weak following traditional ideas .",
    "in fact , the most significant feature of all the axion couplings is that they are proportional to @xmath53 : the larger the pq ssb scale , the weaker the axion couples .",
    "furthermore , we have taken the @xmath54 gev so that couples can be neglected .",
    "certainly , the ordinary matter still affect the evolution of @xmath6 via their contribution to the general expansion of the universe .",
    "now we solve the equations of motion via a numerical calculation at the presence of radiation and matter and obtain the results that will confirm our qualitative analysis . to do this ,",
    "we introduce the new variable @xmath55 therefore , the eqs.([eq : auto1 ] ) are reduced to @xmath56 and @xmath57    where @xmath58 denote the hubble parameter at an initial time .",
    "@xmath59 is defined as @xmath60^{1/2}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the cosmic density parameters for radiation and dust matter at the initial time .",
    "note that when n goes to be very large , or at late - time , the contribution to @xmath27 from matter and radiation will become negligible .",
    "solving these equations will give us some insights into the evolution of the fields and the quantities of interest .",
    "the corresponding conclusions of numerical calculation are shown in fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this numerical solution describes a heteroclinic orbit , which interpolate between an unstable de sitter critical point and a late - time de sitter attractor .",
    "therefore , this model is more natural to explain the two stages of acceleration .",
    "a point worth emphasizing is that the ordinary matter ( radiation and dust ) affect the evolution of the scalar field via their contribution to the general expansion of the universe because of the couples can be neglected in the model . in fig.[fig1 ] , the behavior of the equation of state parameter is shown . at initial time , @xmath50 corresponds the de sitter expansion ( inflationary phase ) , then it increases and becomes positive . after arriving at the value @xmath63",
    ", the universe comes to the radiation dominated epoch and @xmath23 stays on a broad platform .",
    "next , @xmath23 drops to zero and stays on a narrow platform .",
    "finally , @xmath23 drops below zero and approaches to @xmath64 , which corresponds second stage of accelerated expansion .",
    "the evolution of cosmic density parameters are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the argument part contribution @xmath65 stays at @xmath66 at the very first moments of the universe and becomes @xmath67 in late - time , which plays the role of quintessence field . on the other hand",
    ", the modular part contribution @xmath68 plays the role of inflaton . during the whole evolution ,",
    "the radiation energy density and the dust matter energy density become dominate respectively . therefore , we see that the constraints arising from cosmological nucleosynthesis and structure formation are satisfied .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the cosmological implication of a complex scalar model of quintessence inflation with radiation and matter . using the numerical calculation for this model ,",
    "we show that the argument contribution is negligible at the early epoch of the universe while it becomes dominate with the time evolving and the evolution of the modular part is the opposite , which is a viable way to unify the description of the inflationary stage and the current accelerated expansion .",
    "analysis to the dynamical evolution of the complex scalar model indicates that it admits a late - time attractor solution , at which the field behaves as a cosmological constant .",
    "obviously , attractor and heteroclinic orbit are both alleviate the fine tuning problem .",
    "we can also extend our discussion to the lagrangian with non - abelian symmetry , which is an interesting extended work and we will discuss in another preparing work .",
