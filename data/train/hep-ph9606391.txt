    "<S> at a linear collider of the next generation the large event rates expected from bhabha and mller scattering may be used to determine simultaneously @xmath0 and the polarization of both beams with very high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements can be performed in parallel to the other tasks of the linear collider as a free by - product . </S>",

[ 1 ]    psi - pr-96 - 16 + mpi - pht/96 - 49 + june 1996    while the lhc offers an entry into the the high energy regime of the standard modelwith a significant opportunity for discovering new phenomena , the linear electron colliders of the next generation @xcite will provide a complementary program of experiments with unique opportunities for both discoveries and precision measurements . a major asset to fulfill this purpose is the versatility of the linear colliders , as they can be operated in the four , ,  and  modes , with highly polarized electron and photon beams . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , starting from a center of mass  energy of several hundred gev , it will later be possible to upgrade these machines into the tev range .    </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of the linear colliders is the high degree of polarization which can be obtained for the electron beams . </S>",
    "<S> beam polarizations exceeding 80%are by now routinely obtained at slac and are steadily improving . </S>",
    "<S> a final 90%  electron polarization seems a quite sensible assumption @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the positron beam , although at present no scheme for polarizing positrons has been proven to be implementable , there are reasonable hopes that some practicable technology may be available by the time a linear collider  is operating . </S>",
    "<S> this ingredient is an important additional lever arm to increase the sensitivity of the searches for new phenomena , and the precision measurement which are the main goal of a linear collider . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of utter importance to be able to measure the degree of polarization with great accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose here a simple method to determine the polarization of both beams in  and  collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure takes advantage of the large cross sections of bhabha and mller scattering to obtain a good analyzing power , competitive with compton polarimetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as the polarizations are measured from the distributions of the final state electrons and positrons , we are guaranteed to take into account all depolarizing effects which can spoil the initial beam polarization at the interaction point . </S>",
    "<S> a similar procedure has been illustrated for the @xmath1 peak in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the interesting feature of this measurement is that it simultaneously provides a very accurate determination of . at present , </S>",
    "<S> parity violating asymmetry measurements in @xmath1 decays have allowed its most precise determination : combining the sld measurement of the left - right asymmetries with the various asymmetries from lep , the effective leptonic   is now constrained to @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an early discussion of the determination of the weak mixing angle from bhabha scattering at lep1 can be found in @xcite . after the end of operation of the  colliders on the @xmath1 peak , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is unlikely to improve significantly , although interesting proposals have been put forward , for both low @xcite and at high energy @xcite experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore particularly interesting to study the potential of a high energy linear collider  in this respect .    </S>",
    "<S> the typical linear collider  designs aim at an integrated yearly  luminosity @xmath3 scaling with the squared center of mass  energy @xmath4 like    [ lumpe ] l_e^+e^- 80 s , or @xmath5 in @xmath6 units . for the luminosity of the  mode </S>",
    "<S> we take    [ lumee ] l_e^-e^- _ e^+e^-  ,    because this mode will suffer to some extent from the anti - pinch effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if needed , it is straightforward to modify our results for a different scaling relation .    using @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the number of particles in a beam which are longitudinally polarized parallel or antiparallel to their momentum </S>",
    "<S> , we define the polarization of an electron or positron beam to be    p_e^- = p_e^+ =  .    with this definition @xmath9 for electrons and @xmath10 for positrons , where @xmath11 is the helicity mean value .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume the integrated luminosities to be equally distributed over the four possible combinations of beam polarizations @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 and @xmath17 referring to positive and negative polarizations of the beams , respectively ) . from the physics point of view </S>",
    "<S> there is no difference between the last two combinations in the  mode . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the electron guns may have different efficiencies , it is important to consider them both in order to measure this hardware asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is essential that the polarization of the beams be flipped randomly at short time intervals , a technique in use at slc @xcite . in this case , if the absolute value of the polarization is on average constant , random and systematic fluctuations cancel out .    neglecting the @xmath1 width , the polarized differential bhabha and mller scattering cross sections are [ pedxs ] & & d^e^+e^- dt = 4 ^ 2 s^2 + & & -2em \\ { 1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1p_2 4 . + & & -2em + 1 - p_1 - p_2 + p_1p_2 4 + & & -2em . </S>",

    "<S> it is our purpose to use these cross sections to determine as precisely as possible the values of the weak mixing angle and the polarization of each beam : [ param ] p_1 p_2  . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural choice of observables for determining these parameters are the differential events rates n_ll n_rr n_lr n_rl  , where for each bin </S>",
    "<S> n = l _ bin d  . however , the experimental determination of the absolute cross sections is hindered by the systematic error on luminosities , acceptances and efficiencies , which dominate the statistical errors when the event rates are as large as in bhabha and mller scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of great advantage to use three independent differential polarization asymmetries , for example [ as1 ] a_1 = n_ll - n_rr n_ll + n_rr   +   + [ as2 ] a_2 = n_rr - n_lr n_rr + n_lr   +   + [ as3 ] a_3 = n_lr - n_rl n_lr + n_rl , for which the systematic errors cancel out to a very large extent . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the correlations between the three asymmetries are correctly taken into account and the statistical errors dominate , it does not matter which triplet of independent asymmetries is chosen . </S>",
    "<S> any choice other than ( [ as1][as3 ] ) yields the same results .    </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen to normalize the @xmath1 couplings by the fine structure constant @xmath18 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetries depend solely on @xmath22 and the beam polarizations , which effectively parametrize all the available information . moreover , when it will come to compute the radiative corrections , in the framework of an @xmath23 scheme @xcite this choice has the additional advantage of avoiding large electroweak corrections , such as @xmath24 corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the accuracy with which the parameters ( [ param ] ) can be measured is such that we can safely assume a linear dependence of the cross sections ( [ pedxs],[eedxs ] ) in the region of interest , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , within the error bands around the central values . the error bands corresponding to one standard deviation are therefore given by the quadratic form    [ egg ] (   p_1   p_2   ) w^-1 ( + p_1 + p_2 )  =  1  ,    where the inverse covariance matrix @xmath25 is given by    [ cov ] w^-1_ij = _ k , l=1 ^ 3 _ bins v^-1_kl ( a_k _ i ) ( a_l _ j )    _ i = , p_1 , p_2  .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the polarized cross sections , the asymmetries are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> their covariance matrix @xmath26 contains therefore off - diagonal terms and is given by    [ v ] v_kl & = & ( a_k-|a_k ) ( a_l-|a_l ) + & = & _ i=1 ^ 4 ( n_i)^2 ( a_k n_i ) ( a_l n_i ) + ( ) ^2 ( a_k ) ( a_l )    n_i = n_ll , n_rr , n_lr , n_rl  ,    where the statistical errors originating from the uncorrelated polarized event rates in each bin are given by    [ stat ] n_i =  , whereas the systematic error ( second term in eq.([v ] ) ) stems from the inaccurate measurement of the scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> a realistic value that we employ in our analysis is    [ syst ] = 0.5  .    </S>",
    "<S> since the small angle singularities of the differential cross sections cancel out in the asymmetries , the latter have a rather smooth angular dependence . as a result , the contribution of the second term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v ] ) is almost negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic form ( [ egg ] ) defines a 3-dimensional ellipsoid in the @xmath27 parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse covariance matrix @xmath25 are the values of the intersections of the error ellipsoid with the corresponding parameter axes . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to the one - standard - deviation errors on this parameter , assuming the other two parameters are known exactly . in contrast , the square roots of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix @xmath28 are the values of the projections of this ellipsoid onto the corresponding parameter axes . these correspond to the one - standard - deviation errors on this parameter , whatever values the other two parameters assume . </S>",
    "<S> when presenting our results we choose the latter for our predictions of the errors on  and the beam polarizations .    unless stated otherwise , we assume from now on the following values for the expectation values of the parameters and the angular acceptance of the detector : [ numbers ] \\ { = .2315 + p_1=p_2 = 90 % +     to take into account the angular dependence of the asymmetries , we have chosen to work with 200 equal size bins in @xmath29 over the angular range ( [ numbers ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is easy to implement experimentally , as the scattering angles can be measured with very high accuracy ( [ syst ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the asymmetries have a relatively smooth angular behaviour , increasing the number of bins beyond 50 does not significantly improve the accuracy of the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that , as expected , the results approach very closely the cramr - rao minimum variance bound @xcite .    for the sake of illustration , we have plotted in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> flat ] the 3-dimensional ellipsoid defined by the quadratic form ( [ egg ] ) for the  experiment at 500 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this figure provides some interesting insight . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is clear that the two polarization measurements are highly correlated , in the sense that the average polarization can be determined much more precisely than the polarization difference of the two beams . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast ,  is only weakly correlated to the beam polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> because we assume the luminosities to scale proportionally to the square of the collider energy ( [ lumpe],[lumee ] ) , the resolution of the measurement improves at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ feny ] , where we plot the center of mass  energy dependence of the one standard deviation errors on the measurements of  and the electron beam polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a clear saturation beyond 1 tev for both bhabha and mller scattering .    at @xmath30 gev ,  </S>",
    "<S> can be measured with an error of about @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> although this will not improve the combined lep - slc accuracy , it may provide an independent check . on the other hand , at 2 tev the resolution on  can reach up to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the polarization can be determined at 500 gev down to 2%  in bhabha and 1.5%  in mller scattering . </S>",
    "<S> compton polarimetry currently yields a similar accuracy of 1.7%  @xcite and is constantly improving . </S>",
    "<S> however , at 2 tev both bhabha and mller scattering can measure the polarization down to 0.5% , a very promising result .    as we mainly rely on the @xmath33 interferences to measure , </S>",
    "<S> it is essential to probe small scattering angles . </S>",
    "<S> this is well depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fcos ] , where we display the errors as a function of the polar angle coverage . </S>",
    "<S> the slight decrease in sensitivity observed for very small polar angle is due to the finite bin size . </S>",
    "<S> improving the angular coverage beyond @xmath34 does not appear to be very useful . </S>",
    "<S> the error on the polarization is not very sensitive to the detector acceptance , especially for mller scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the errors on the polarization of both beams is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fpol ] </S>",
    "<S> . clearly , high degrees of polarization are an important asset , especially at lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> this should not present any problem for the electron beams and the mller scattering experiment . to gauge , however , the importance of the positron polarization in bhabha scattering , we plot in fig .  [ fppo ] </S>",
    "<S> the errors as a function of the positron beam polarization . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that at 500 gev the resolution degrades significantly for positron polarizations less than 50% . for 2 tev collisions positron polarizations as small as 30%still yield interesting results .    in the event </S>",
    "<S> the positrons can not be polarized at all , a strong correlation develops between  and the electron polarization so that these two parameters remain effectively unconstrained . </S>",
    "<S> still ,  can be determined accurately if the electron polarization is also known precisely from the onset ( from compton polarimetry for instance ) and its resolution is treated as a systematic error . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we observe in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fnop ] , that the resolution on   is approximately degraded by as little as a factor @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error stemming from the measurement of the electron polarization is not very important .    </S>",
    "<S> the bounds to be obtained for a few realistic energies and polarizations are summarized in table  [ t1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> they assume of course the validity of the luminosities stated in eqs  ( [ lumpe],[lumee ] ) . for different values of the integrated luminosity </S>",
    "<S> the results can be easily corrected , since the statistical errors largely dominate the systematic errors included here and scale like @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that , with respect to the processes studied here , the @xmath37 mode yields much less interesting bounds , about one order of magnitude worse . </S>",
    "<S> this is obviously expected because of the absence of the forward coulomb peak in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> the present preliminary analysis has been carried out at the tree level only . </S>",
    "<S> electroweak radiative corrections to bhabha scattering off the @xmath1 peak have been first calculated in @xcite , and updated to leading two - loop order in @xcite . in general , electroweak corrections </S>",
    "<S> can be included in the bhabha amplitudes by means of three complex - valued gauge invariant form factors explicitly depending on @xmath38 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect a similar factorization of radiative corrections in mller scattering , for which a full one - loop computation , to the best of our knowledge , is still missing at high energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of these calculable radiative effects and a discussion of the problems connected to matching the required accuracy of less than one permille are beyond the scope of this paper , but they should not affect significantly our estimates of the statistical error , particularly because they are dominated by events in the forward peak , where electroweak corrections become less relevant . </S>",
    "<S> qed effects are generally quite sizable in large angle bhabha and mller scattering @xcite , and could in principle introduce additional uncertainties </S>",
    "<S> . however , soft photons and other qed effects factorize and cancel in the parity violating asymmetries , and we do not expect dramatic effects on our error estimates .    to conclude , we have demonstrated how the large bhabha and mller scattering cross sections can be advantageously used at a high energy linear colliderto measure the polarization of the incoming electron or positron beams down to the percent level or better . </S>",
    "<S> the method we propose measures the polarization of the interacting beams through the final states , so that it takes into account all depolarizing effects due to beamstrahlung and disruption .    </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the value of  can be determined in 500 gev collisions with an absolute error of about @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this error can be further reduced down to almost @xmath32 , by increasing the center of mass  energy up to 2 tev . beyond this energy , however , there is little gain unless the luminosity is increased with respect to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lumpe],[lumee ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these precision measurements can be easily carried out and do not interfere with the main tasks of the linear collider . to reach the abovementioned accuracies , though , it is essential to have a good polar angle coverage of the detector as well as highly polarized beams .    if electron and positron beams can be polarized with the same efficiency , both bhabha and mller scattering yield very similar results . at high energies bhabha scattering performs marginally better , because of the higher luminosity of the  mode with respect to the  mode ( [ lumee ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if positron beams can not be polarized , the resolving power of bhabha scattering is approximately reduced by 30% . </S>"
