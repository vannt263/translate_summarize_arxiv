    "the survey sample ( figure  1 ) consists of 67 galaxies drawn from the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs ) , a survey of @xmath0200 galaxies including all morphological types in their natural abundance and spanning luminosities from m@xmath1 @xmath223 to @xmath215 ( jansen et al.2000 ) .",
    "our sample includes all of the nfgs e / s0 s with extended gas emission , a representative majority of the sa  sbc spirals , and a few later types .",
    "three s0 s show minimal rotation with uncertain sense .",
    "counterrotators are circled in figure  1 .",
    "four are e / s0 s , totalling 24(29)% of all sample e / s0 s with(without ) the 3 uncertain s0 s .",
    "one is an i m , for which the confidence of our counterrotation claim is @xmath02.2@xmath3 .",
    "full details appear in kannappan & fabricant ( 2000 ) .",
    "we stress that our detections represent a lower limit , because we can not separate multiple kinematic components .",
    "bertola , buson , & zeilinger ( 1992 ) and kuijken , fisher , & merrifield ( 1996 ) , find gas - stellar counterrotation frequencies of @xmath02025% for emission line s0 s .",
    "we find 14(18)% with(without ) the 3 uncertain s0 s .",
    "this agreement , despite a strong difference in sample luminosity distributions ( figure  1 ) , suggests that similar mechanisms form gas rich s0 s over a wide range of physical scales .    among 38 sa ",
    "sbc spiral galaxies , we find no clear cases of bulk counterrotation , implying a counterrotation frequency of @xmath48% ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "however , counterrotation can not be ruled out in the inner parts of one sa ( ngc  4795 ) .",
    "this galaxy shows clear evidence of gas - stellar decoupling at large radii ( figure  2 ) , possibly related to satellite accretion .",
    "jore ( 1997 ) finds a bulk counterrotation frequency of @xmath017% in a sample of 23 bright sa s , consistent with our results given our sa sample size of 8 ( see also haynes et al.2000 ) .    as argued in kannappan & fabricant ( 2000 )",
    ", mergers and accretion provide the simplest explanation for the counterrotators properties , particularly their early type morphologies , significant hi masses , and lack of obvious close neighbors .",
    "the signatures of minor retrograde accretion events may be washed out in gas rich spirals , while more substantial mergers are likely to produce e / s0/sa galaxies .",
    "dwarf - dwarf mergers may help to explain the faint s0 population ."
