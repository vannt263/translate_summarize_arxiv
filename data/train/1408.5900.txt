    "the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) continua of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to form in the black hole accretion disk ( krolik 1999 ; koratkar & blaes 1999 ) , but their ionizing photons can influence physical conditions in the broad emission - line region of the agn as well as the surrounding interstellar and intergalactic gas .",
    "the metagalactic background from galaxies and agn is also an important parameter in cosmological simulations , as a dominant source of ionizing radiation , critical for interpreting broad emission - line spectra of agn , intergalactic metal - line absorbers , and fluctuations in the ratio of the ly@xmath1  absorbers of  and .    since the deployment of the first space - borne ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrographs",
    ", astronomers have combined spectral observations of agn into composite spectra .",
    "these composites constrain the intensity and shape of the agn component of the ionizing photon background .",
    "the most direct probe of the fuv and euv continua in the agn rest frame comes from observations taken by instruments such as the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) and a series of uv spectrographs aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) : the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , and the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) .",
    "ultraviolet spectra were also obtained by the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "for agn at modest redshifts , all of these instruments provide access to the rest - frame lyman continuum ( lyc , @xmath10   ) , and at @xmath11 they avoid strong contamination from the ly@xmath1-forest absorbers in the spectra of high - redshift agn .",
    "thus , obtaining access to high - s / n , moderate - resolution uv spectra is crucial for finding a reliable underlying continuum .",
    "+ this is our second paper , following a agn composite spectrum presented in paper  i ( shull et  al .",
    "2012 ) based on initial results from cos spectra of 22 agn at redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "we analyzed their rest - frame fuv and euv spectra , taken with the g130 m and g160 m gratings , whose resolving power @xmath13 ( 17 km  s@xmath14  velocity resolution ) allows us to distinguish line blanketing from narrow interstellar and intergalactic absorption lines . here , in paper ii , we enlarge our composite spectrum from 22 to 159 agn , confirm the validity of our early results , and explore possible variations of the euv spectral index with agn type and luminosity .",
    "both studies were enabled by high - quality , moderate - resolution spectra taken with the cosmic origins spectrograph installed on _ hst _   during the may 2009 servicing mission .",
    "the cos instrument ( green et  al .  2012 ) was designed explicitly for point - source spectroscopy of faint targets , particularly quasars and other agn used as background sources for absorption - line studies of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) , and interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "our survey is based on high - quality spectra of the numerous agn used in these projects .",
    "+ our expanded survey of 159 agn finds a composite spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with frequency index @xmath9 in the rest - frame euv .",
    "this confirms the results of paper i , where we found @xmath15 .",
    "we adopt the convention in which rest - frame flux distributions are fitted to power laws in wavelength , @xmath16 , and converted to @xmath5 in frequency with @xmath17 .",
    "we caution that these spectral indices are _ local _ measures of the slope over a small range in wavelength , @xmath18 . because of",
    "curvature of the agn spectral distributions , local slopes can be misleading , when compared to different wavelength bands and to objects at different redshift .",
    "we return to this issue in section 3.3 where we discuss possible correlations of indices @xmath19 with agn type , redshift , and luminosity and compare indices measured by both _ hst_/cos and _ fuse_. + the cos composite spectrum is somewhat harder than that in earlier _ hst_/fos and stis observations ( telfer et  al .   2002 ) who fitted the continuum ( 5001200   ) with @xmath20 for 184 qsos at @xmath21 .",

    "our fit differs considerably from the _ fuse _  survey of 85 agn at @xmath23 ( scott et  al .",
    "2004 ) who found a harder composite spectrum with @xmath24 .",
    "the different indices could arise in part from the small numbers of targets observed in the rest - frame euv . even in the current sample ,",
    "only 10 or fewer agn observations cover the spectral range @xmath25   . another important difference in methodology is our placement of the euv continuum relative to strong emission lines such as  ( 770 , 780   ) ,  ( 570   ) ,  ( 834   ) ,  ( 833 , 702   ) ,  ( 788 , 554   ) ,  ( 630   ) , and  ( 1032 , 1038   ) . identifying and fitting these emission lines requires high s / n spectra .",
    "a complete list of lines appears in table 4 of paper  i. we also use the higher spectral resolution of the cos ( g130 m and g160 m ) gratings to distinguish the line - blanketing by narrow absorption lines from the ly@xmath1  forest .",

    "we follow the same procedure as in paper i for obtaining , reducing , and processing the data .",

    "many of these techniques of coaddition and continuum fitting were also discussed in our igm survey ( danforth et  al .",
    "of particular interest in this paper are new techniques for identifying lls and plls absorbers , measuring their  column densities , and using that information to correct the continuum .",
    "our analysis proceeds through the following steps :    1 .   *",
    "retrieve exposures . *",
    "the calcos calibrated exposures were downloaded from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) and then aligned and co - added using idl procedures developed by the cos gto team .",
    "typical wavelength shifts were a resolution element ( @xmath450.1   ) or less , and the co - added flux in each pixel was calculated as the exposure - weighed mean of the flux in aligned exposures",
    "fit spline functions to spectra . *",
    "the raw data contain narrow absorption features that should be excluded from the agn composite spectrum .",
    "identifying and masking each of these features by hand in all of our spectra would be extremely tedious .",
    "for this reason , we utilize a semi - automated routine that removes narrow absorption features and fits the remaining data with a piecewise - continuous function composed of spline functions and legendre polynomial functions .",
    "this spline - fitting process involves first splitting the spectra into 5 - 10     segments and calculating the average s / n per pixel ( flux / error ) in each segment .",
    "pixels with s / n less than 1.5 @xmath46 below their segment s / n are rejected from the fitting process to exclude absorption features and regions of increased noise .",
    "this process is repeated iteratively until there is little change between iterations .",
    "the median flux values in the segments are then fitted with a spline function .",
    "we manually inspect the fits and adjust the identification of rejected regions as necessary .",
    "smoothly varying data are well described by this spline - only method . near broad emission and other cusp - like features , short segments of piecewise - continuous legendre polynomials",
    "are preferred .",

    "* deredden spectra . *",
    "we correct the fine - grained data and their corresponding spline fits for galactic reddening , using the empirical mean extinction curve of fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) with a ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath47 and color excesses @xmath48 from ned . in this paper",

    "we can probably rule out a large amount of dust ( see discussion in section 3.2 ) .",
    "4 .   * identify plls and lls absorption . * in paper",
    "i , we identified plls absorption by inspecting the spectra for flux decrements or lyman breaks . for this paper",
    "we employ a custom computer script that scans each spectrum for correlated down - pixels at the locations of higher - order lyman lines of plls and lls absorbers .",
    "first , the script divides the spectra by their respective spline fits , normalizing the flux unaffected by igm absorption to unity .",
    "we determine the median flux for 15 pixels that have the same relative spacing as the first 15  lyman lines of a plls with a redshift equal to the source agn .",
    "if there is a plls , the median will be much less than unity .",
    "we then step one pixel to the left , recalculate the relative spacing of the first 15 lyman lines at this redshift and the median flux for this group of 15 pixels .",
    "we repeat this process until we reach the end of the spectrum or a plls redshift of zero .",
    "the script returns a list of redshifts of system candidates to be inspected . when a system is confirmed , we measure the equivalent widths of up to the first 12 lyman lines and fit them to a curve of growth ( cog ) to determine the column density and doppler parameter of the system . in paper",
    "i , we found a total of 17 lls and plls systems in 8 of the 22 sight lines , and we were sensitive to systems with column density @xmath50 . in this paper , using our new identification method , we confirm the 17 previously identified systems plus 13 unidentified systems above the sensitivity limit @xmath51 in the same 22 sight lines from paper i. figure 3 shows examples of plls identification and continuum restoration .",

    "we only correct for these 167 systems in our analysis .",
    "systems with @xmath55 and @xmath56 have opacity that depress the flux immediately blueward of the lyman limit by less than 2@xmath49 and 0.7@xmath49 respectively . owing to the multiple correlated lyman lines used in this identification technique ,",
    "our sensitivity is better than the local s / n over most of the spectral coverage . correcting for the opacity of weaker systems ( @xmath57 ) would have a negligible effect on our analysis of agn continuum , changing the euv slope of our composite spectrum by only 0.006 .",

    "we correct only the flux below the lyman limit .",
    "when a spectrum has plls absorption with column density @xmath59 , we mask the flux between the lyman limit ( 911.753   ) and lyman-9 ( 916.429   ) or @xmath454.7    redward in the plls rest - frame . for a plls with @xmath60",
    ", we mask from the lyman limit to lyman-13 ( 920.963   ) or @xmath459.2    redward . when data blueward of the lyman limit of lls or plls had @xmath61 or did not appear continuous with two or more regions of continuum redward of the lyman limit , we masked the data .",
    "we also mask regions of the spectra affected by broad absorption from damped ly@xmath1  systems and h@xmath62 lyman bands after qualitative visual inspection .",
    "the amount of masking varies for individual cases .",
    "some spectra have one or two gaps of @xmath6310    in the data from observations that were not planned with contiguous wavelength coverage over the entire cos - fuv spectral range .",
    "these gaps are masked prior to our continuum analysis .",
    "* shift to rest - frame . *",
    "we shift each spectrum to the rest - frame of the agn by dividing the wavelength array by @xmath64 .",

    "* resample the spectra . * as in paper  i and telfer et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we resample the spectra to uniform 0.1    bins .",
    "after resampling , each flux pixel corresponds to a new wavelength bin and is equal to the mean of the flux in the old pixels that overlap the new bin , weighted by the extent of overlap .",
    "the error arrays associated with the resampled spectra are determined using a weighting method similar to the flux rebinning .",
    "see equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in telfer et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the rebinning formulae .",
    "to construct the overall composite spectrum we start by following the bootstrap method of telfer et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and then adapt the construction technique for our unique dataset . to summarize the bootstrap technique ,",
    "we start near the central region of the output composite spectrum , between 1050    and 1150   , and normalize the spectra that include the entire central region to have an average flux value of 1 within the central region , which we refer to as the  central continuum window . \"",
    "we then include spectra in sorted order toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "lastly , we include the spectra in sorted order toward longer wavelengths .",
    "when a spectrum does not cover the central continuum window , we normalize it to the partially formed composite by finding the weighted - mean normalization constant within multiple emission - line - free continuum windows , calculated using equation ( 4 ) of telfer et  al .",
    "we form two independent composite spectra simultaneously : one of the fine - grained spectra showing the line - blanketing by the ly@xmath1  forest and interstellar absorption lines , and another of the spline fits to the individual spectra .",
    "the spline fits pass over the narrow absorption lines .    with our unique dataset and spline",
    "fits , we adjust the composite construction method in five ways .",
    "first , with the identification in paper i of broad emission lines from highly ionized species below 800   , we were able to restrict the normalization of the spectra at the highest redshifts to two narrow regions of continuum - like windows at 660 - 670    and 715 - 735   .",
    "this is in contrast to using all of the flux , including that from emission lines below 800    in the calculation of the normalization constant , as was done in our initial method .",
    "our second adjustment also limits the normalization calculation to regions of continuum , which is our primary interest .",
    "we refine and narrow the continuum windows above 800    to wavelengths 855 - 880   , 1090 - 1105   , 1140 - 1155   , 1280 - 1290   , 1315 - 1325   , and 1440 - 1465   . for our third adjustment",
    "we choose the region between 855 - 880    as the central continuum window , because it is the largest of the narrowed euv continuum windows with a large number of contributing spectra .",
    "fourth , we note that the bootstrapping technique can be sensitive to the ordering in which one includes the spectra , especially at the beginning of the process when only a handful of spectra determine the shape of the composite",
    ". therefore , we increase the number of spectra normalized at only the central continuum window from 40 to 70 by decreasing the required overlap with the central continuum window from 100% to 50% .",
    "lastly , because we are interested in characterizing the shape of the underlying continuum as a power law , we follow the approach of vanden berk et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and combine the spectra as a geometric mean , which preserves power - law slopes .",
    "we also provide a median - combined composite , which preserves the relative shape of the emission features .    below 700  ,",
    "the number of agn spectra contributing to each 0.1    bin in figure 2 declines steadily .",
    "several agn listed in table 1 do not appear in this figure because their short - wavelength spectra are masked out , owing to lls absorption , airglow , and plls edges .",
    "the final overall sample composite spectra ( both geometric - mean and median ) are presented in two panels of figure 5 , covering rest - frame wavelengths from 475 - 1785   . in each panel , we show both the fine - grained data with absorption lines included and the spline - fit continuum composites . in the geometric - mean spectrum , which we regard as the better characterization of the agn composite ,",
    "the effects of line - blanketing by the ly@xmath1  forest can be seen in the difference between the spline - fit composite and the real data composite .",
    "figure 6 shows the optical depth , @xmath67 , arising from line - blanketing of the continuum by the ly@xmath1  forest at @xmath68   .",
    "we derive optical depths from the difference in fluxes ( red and black ) in the geometric mean composite , shown in the top panel of figure 5 .    to characterize the continuum slope of the composite spectrum , we follow the simple approach of vanden berk et  al .",
    "we calculate the slope between continuum regions of maximum separation on either side of the spectral break , which is clearly present in the composite around 1000   . because the flux distribution , @xmath35 , flattens at shorter wavelengths , the two power - law fits pass under the observed spectrum and match at the break .",
    "to satisfy this condition , we first calculate the slope of a line connecting the minima of the two best continuum regions in log - log space .",
    "we then divide the entire spectrum by this line , find the wavelengths of the minima , and calculate the slope of the line that connects the second pair of minima .",
    "this results in a line that does not cross the composite .",
    "we perform this calculation twice , once in the euv and again in the fuv .",
    "we find a mean euv spectral index @xmath69 between line - free windows centered at 724.5    and 859   , and mean fuv index @xmath70 between 1101    and 1449   .",
    "these wavelength indices correspond to frequency indices @xmath71 of @xmath72 ( euv ) and @xmath73 ( fuv ) .",
    "we now discuss sources of random and systematic uncertainty in the composite spectral indices . as in paper",
    "i , we fit two power laws to the spline composite spectrum , with indices @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and match them at a break wavelength , which we find to be @xmath7   , consistent with paper i and accurate to @xmath76   .",
    "although this gradual break is apparent in the composite , its presence is less clear in the individual spectra , owing to the limited spectral range of the cos observations and to strong emission lines of  @xmath77 and ly@xmath78  @xmath79 near the break wavelength .",
    "because the sample of agn in paper i had no targets between @xmath80 , most rest - frame spectra lay either blueward or redward of the 1000    break . in our new sample , 55 agn have redshifts in that range , but we do not distinguish a clear break in individual spectra . with the limited wavelength coverage of cos ( g130 m , g160 m ) , any single agn spectrum does not have access to the four continuum windows needed to measure two distinct power laws that straddle the break .    to quantify the uncertainty in the fitting of the composite spectrum",
    ", we explore the sources of uncertainty described by scott et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , including the effects of intrinsic variations in the shape of the seds , galactic extinction , and formal statistical fitting errors . as in paper",
    "i , we do not include the effects of intrinsic absorbers or interstellar lines , as these absorption lines are easily removed with our moderate - resolution cos spectra .",
    "however , we do consider the effects from the strongest systems in the ly@xmath1  forest .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty comes from the natural variations in the slope of the contributing spectra .",
    "we estimate this uncertainty by selecting 1000 bootstrap samples with replacement from our sample of 159 agn spectra .",

    "we find that @xmath75 changes by @xmath96 and @xmath74 by @xmath97 .",
    "the formal statistical errors for the spectral indices are negligible ( @xmath98 ) , owing to the high s / n ratio of our composite spectra .",

    "we add the random uncertainties of cosmic variance with the systematic effects of correcting for extinction in quadrature and estimate the total uncertainties to be @xmath99 for @xmath75 and @xmath100 for @xmath74 .",
    "as noted earlier , we do not correct for agn dust , but small amounts could be present , as long as they do not produce a strong turnover in the far - uv fluxes .",
    "we can rule out a large amount of intrinsic extinction , if it obeys a selective extinction law , @xmath101 , that rises steeply at short ( uv ) wavelengths .",
    "otherwise , we would see steep curvature in the rest - frame euv , rather than a power law .",

    "2004 ) , a puzzling discrepancy that we now investigate .    the differences between continuum slopes found in _ fuse _  and cos composite spectra are likely to arise from four general factors : ( 1 ) continuum placement beneath prominent euv emission lines ; ( 2 ) line blanketing by the ly@xmath1  forest and stronger ( plls ) absorbers ; ( 3 ) continuum windows that span an intrinsically curved agn spectrum ; and ( 4 ) possible correlation of slope and agn luminosity .",
