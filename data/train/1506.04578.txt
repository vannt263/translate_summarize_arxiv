    "the hydrodynamic description of granular materials is useful to know the rheological properties of the granular flow . since",
    "granular materials are recognized to behave as unusual solids , liquids and gases , granular materials have attracted much interest among physicists @xcite . the most idealistic granular system is a dilute gas without any external forces such as gravity . to analyze such a simple system is important to understand complex behavior of granular materials . if the kinetic energy or the granular temperature of a granular gas homogeneously decreases because of inelastic collisions between grains , the time evolution of the temperature obeys haff s law @xcite . however",
    ", this homogeneous cooling state can not be maintained as time goes on , because clusters of dense region appear @xcite .",
    "such inhomogeneity of granular gases can be understood by granular hydrodynamics @xcite in which the transport coefficients for the inelastic hard core system for the dilute case @xcite and the moderately dense case @xcite can be determined by the inelastic boltzmann - enskog equation @xcite .",
    "these theoretical results exhibit good agreements with the numerical simulations , at least , for nearly homogeneous moderately dense granular flows @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we often use the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) to evaluate the transport coefficients instead of using the molecular dynamics simulation , which was originally introduced by bird @xcite to study rarefied gas @xcite and later has been extended to dilute inelastic gases @xcite and to dense inelastic gases @xcite .",
    "this is because we should keep the system almost uniform .",
    "the interaction between contacting granular particles usually consists of the repulsive force and the dissipative force proportional to the relative speed . for fine powders and wet granular particles ,",
    "however , cohesive force can not be ignored .",
    "the origins of such cohesive force are , respectively , van der waals force for fine powders and capillary force for wet granular particles @xcite .",
    "such cohesive forces can cause the liquid - gas phase transition @xcite , the variations of cluster formation of freely falling granular particles @xcite , and the enhancement of the jamming transition @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of cohesive granular materials is important for both physics and industry to treat real granular materials . in our previous paper",
    ", we have demonstrated the existence of various phases for fine powders in the presence of a plane shear , which can not be observed in granular gases under the shear @xcite .",
    "we have also developed the dynamic van der waals model in describing such a system @xcite and obtain qualitatively consistent results with those in ref .",
    "these results suggest that the ordinary kinetic theory for a hard core system can not be applied to this system .",
    "needless to say , the kinetic theory is important to give us the microscopic basis of the macroscopic phenomenology such as ref .",

    "@xcite . in this paper ,",
    "let us consider a granular gas whose interaction consists of the hard core for repulsive part and a square well potential for an attractive part .",
    "there exist some studies on the kinetic theory of gas molecules having the square well potential @xcite in which , the collision processes are categorized into four processes : ( i ) hard core collisions , ( ii ) entering processes , ( iii ) leaving processes from the well , and ( iv ) trapping processes by the well @xcite .",
    "note that most of previous works study gases without dissipations in collisions except for some recent papers @xcite , which do not discuss the transport coefficients .",
    "it should also be noted that some papers developed the kinetic theory based on different models for cohesion @xcite .    in this paper , we derive modified haff s law and derive the transport coefficients for the dilute cohesive granular gases in freely cooling processes . for this purpose ,",
    "we extend the kinetic theory for the inelastic hard core system to the nearly elastic granular gases having the square well potential .",
