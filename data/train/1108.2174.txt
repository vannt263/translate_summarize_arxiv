    "it is a difficult problem to predict when a framework @xmath5 in euclidean space @xmath2 is flexible .",
    "it is even less common to predict that a framework @xmath5 is flexible in another metric , such as the spherical space @xmath4 , hyperbolic space @xmath1 , or even minkowskian space @xmath0 .",
    "there are a few well known examples , such as the bricard octahedra , which have been shown to be flexible in each of these spaces , but with a separate proof for each space @xcite .",
    "such examples raise the possibility that there are transfer principles which would bring some flexibility results from one space to another . in this paper",
    ", we present one such transfer principle .",
    "coning is an established tool for transferring results about infinitesimal rigidity of a framework from @xmath2 to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "working within the cone , with the original framework placed on the hyperplane @xmath7 , then pulling points back and forth towards the cone vertex , we can also transfer infinitesimal rigidity results from @xmath2 through the cone to the spherical space @xmath4 within @xmath6 , with the cone point at the center of the sphere @xcite . as a more subtle consequence of the equivalence of infinitesimal flexibility and finite flexibility at regular configurations ( configurations where the rigidity matrix indexed by the edges and vertices of the framework has maximal rank ) , this process also transfers finite flexes between @xmath2 , the cone in @xmath6 , and the sphere @xmath4 .",
    "several recent papers have examined when symmetry of a framework induces unexpected finite flexes in @xmath2 , most recently using a symmetric analog of the rigidity matrix : the orbit matrix @xcite . this matrix has rows indexed by orbits of edges under the symmetry group , and columns indexed by orbits of vertices under the group .",
    "again , in this setting , fully symmetric infinitesimal flexes and finite flexes are equivalent at symmetry regular configurations ( configurations where the orbit matrix has maximal rank ) .",
    "it is a natural question to ask when this symmetry analysis is preserved by coning , so that a symmetry induced finite flex in @xmath2 transfers to the cone in @xmath6 and to the sphere @xmath4 .",
    "our starting point in  3 is to confirm that this transfer works when the cone point is placed ` above ' the central point of the symmetry group ( point group ) . in the process",
    ", we give an alternate proof of the transfer for the identity group , using direct matrix manipulations on the rigidity matrix , and then extend the analysis to the orbit matrix .",
    "previous work on rigidity in non - euclidean geometry has included results on the transfer to hyperbolic space @xcite .",
    "we fit this into our scheme by ( a ) embedding the framework @xmath5 in @xmath2 on the hyperplane @xmath7 in minkowskian space @xmath8 and ( b ) coning the framework to the origin , in a way that transfers all the infinitesimal rigidity properties .",
    "this works for an arbitrary symmetry group in @xmath2 , carrying over to symmetries in @xmath8 , and preserving the rank of the corresponding orbit matrix .",
    "now , when we push the vertices onto the ` unit sphere ' , we have a framework in hyperbolic space @xmath1 .",
    "this preserves all the key properties including taking symmetry regular configurations in @xmath2 onto symmetry regular configurations of the cone in @xmath8 , and finite flexes at regular points to finite flexes at regular points .",
    "these results suggest two directions for extensions .",
    "one is : what other metrics can we transfer to ?",
    "we recall that infinitesimal rigidity ( but not symmetry ) is a projective invariant @xcite , and can be expressed in projective terms .",
    "it is then natural to consider other metrics layered onto projective geometry - the cayley - klein geometries @xcite . in  [ sec : projective ] we briefly outline how the transfer process generalizes to families of these geometries , provided that the metric is associated with a quadratic form with a signature of all positive and negative entries , or with a sphere in such a space .",
    "exactly how far this transfer stretches is a topic for further explorations .",
    "a second direction for extension is the big question : when do finite motions transfer from frameworks in one space to frameworks in another space ?",
    "it is a hard problem to decide whether a specific framework @xmath5 which is first - order flexible in a special position is rigid or flexible .",
    "it is then at least as hard to decide whether flexibility would transfer to another metric with , for example , the same projective coordinates .",
    "the results in this paper indicate that this transfer can be accomplished when we have an algebraic variety of configurations @xmath9 , within which the framework moves for regular points of the variety .",
    "the key case here is the variety of @xmath10-symmetric configurations for a group @xmath10 , where symmetric infinitesimal motions and the symmetry regular configurations are detected by the orbit matrix .",
    "further , the algebraic variety is preserved in the transfer , as is the rank of an associated matrix which tests for the infinitesimal motions tangent to the variety .",
    "there are some other varieties which are candidates for such transfer .",
    "one sample is the varieties associated with ` flatness ' - sets of points in the configuration lying in linear subspaces , which are known to generate finite motions for some classes of complete bipartite graphs .",
    "again , the range of extensions of these methods is an inviting question for further exploration .",
