    "gravitationally contracting low mass ( @xmath4 ) stars are fully convective ( hayashi track evolution ) until they near the main sequence . as the contraction proceeds , the stellar temperature rises and when the core temperature reaches @xmath5  k , depletion of lithium begins via @xmath6 reaction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since the lithium burning process is very sensitive to the core temperature ( burning rate  @xmath7 , @xcite ) , once li burning starts , it will consume all available lithium in a very short timescale ( @xmath8  myr ) .",
    "however , more massive stars ( @xmath9 ) form radiative cores in their early evolution that results in a separation of the surface layers from the hotter inner regions . as long as the temperature at the base of the convective layer is below the li burning temperature , surface li can be preserved .",
    "on the other hand , if stellar mass is too low ( @xmath10 ) , a star ( in fact , a brown dwarf ) can never attain a high enough core temperature to burn li ; hence such brown dwarfs should always show strong li absorption at 6708   .",
    "for the higher mass brown dwarfs ( mass range of @xmath11 ) , lithium eventually can burn @xcite .    because of the fast li burning process , the location of the li burning boundary in a coeval stellar group should be well defined .",
    "the li depletion boundary ( ldb ) of older clusters stays at @xmath12 , since that is the mass below which brown dwarfs never get hot enough to burn lithium .",
    "this implies that the ldb age determination only works up to an age of about 250  myr which is the age when the interior of a @xmath13 brown dwarf just creeps above the lithium burning temperature .",
    "ldbs of younger clusters will be located at higher masses than the ldb of old clusters because lesser mass stars take more time to reach the lithium burning temperature by gravitational contraction than more massive stars do .",
    "once the luminosity of cluster stars at the ldb is known , the ldb location can be compared to that of theoretical models from which we can estimate the cluster age . to date , ldbs have been detected in three open clusters  pleiades @xcite , @xmath3  persei @xcite , and ic  2391 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , ages determined from the ldb method for these clusters are all @xmath14% larger than traditional upper main sequence fitting ages ( table  [ ldb ] ) , and the lithium ages have generally been adopted as correct . if so , then traditional interior models for the upper main sequence must be revised .",

    "the hip  112312 binary system has a well determined distance from hipparcos ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 photometric magnitudes . using these data",
    ", we can check if theoretical models of photometric isochrone ages and li depletion ages are self - consistent . in this paper , we compare frequently used theoretical models with parameters derived from our observations .",
    "we obtained spectra of ww  psa ( @xmath22gj  871.1  a ) and tx  psa ( @xmath23gj  871.1  b ) as part of an extensive on - going search for young and nearby stars to earth ( song , bessell , & zuckerman , apj in prep . ) .",
    "high resolution spectra were obtained using an echelle spectrograph on the nasmyth - b focus and medium resolution spectra were obtained with double beam spectrograph ( dbs ) on the nasmyth - a focus of the australian national university s 2.3  m telescope .",
    "the red channel of the dbs covered the spectral range @xmath24  at a measured resolution of 1.2 ( 0.55 / pixel ) .",
    "dbs spectra , displayed in figure  [ spectrum ] , have @xmath25 counts per pixel in the vicinity of 6700 . from these spectra",
    ", one can clearly see the non - detection and detection of the li  6708  absorption feature from the primary and secondary , respectively , and strong h@xmath26 emission from both stars .",
    "eight orders of the echelle covered portions of the spectra between 5800 and 7230 . at orders containing the h@xmath26 and li 6708  lines , the measured resolution was 0.45 ( 0.17 / pixel ) .",
    "all spectra were reduced following standard procedure using iraf .",
    "we also obtained @xmath27 photometric magnitudes of the binary as part of a larger photometry program ( shobbrook et al .",
    ", in preparation ) for young stars identified in our on - going spectroscopy program .",
    "the hip  112312 components have @xmath28 magnitudes from the 2mass 2nd release database .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric data are summarized in table  [ data ] .",
    "some colors of the hip  112312 binary from @xmath21 are slightly inconsistent compared to normal m dwarfs . for example , the @xmath30 of the two stars are bluer by about 0.1  mag than normal m dwarfs",
    ". the lower gravity of a young m dwarf compared to the mean gravities of zams m dwarfs could account for much of this difference and a few stars in the taurus - auriga region studied by @xcite have similarly blue @xmath31 colors for their @xmath32 colors .",
    "the pleiades m dwarfs are also bluer in @xmath33 than one would expect for their @xmath34 or @xmath35 colors ( stauffer et al .",
    "2002 , in prep . ) .",
    "this is probably    [ cols=\"^ , > , < , > , < \" , ]     recently , @xcite estimated a kinematic age of the @xmath36  pictoris moving group by tracing positions of individual members back in time .",
    "they found that the @xmath36  pictoris members occupied the smallest volume about 11.5  myr ago ; hence they assigned a kinematic age of 11.5  myr .",
    "we obtain somewhat similar results when we trace positions of the currently known members back in time using constant velocity trajectories ( i.e. , no galactic potential treatment , song et al . in prep . ) .",
    "many members were more concentrated into a central cluster about 12  myr ago although the overall size of the moving group has not been reduced as much as claimed in @xcite .",
    "the reasonably good agreement between photometric isochrone age and dynamical age of the @xmath37  pictoris group indicates that ages estimated from theoretical isochrones can be trusted in general for @xmath38  myr old stars .",
    "based on the facts that the hip  112312  a component locates on the hertzsprung - russell diagram above the 10  myr isochrone and that hip  112312 ab may belong to a large @xmath0  myr old @xmath39  pictoris moving group @xcite , we believe that the true age of hip  112312 can not be older than 20  myr . at the age upper limit of 20  myr , all three theoretical models predict too slow li depletion ( here we assume that for given ages , theoretical model effective temperature and luminosity calculations are more reliable than lithium depletion calculations ) . if the true age of hip  112312 is younger than @xmath40  myr ( as may be hinted from figure  [ hrd ] ) , then inconsistency between photometric data and li depletion timescales of contemporary theoretical models becomes more severe .",
    "if the true age of hip  112312 is not significantly different from @xmath40  myr , thus requiring a faster li depletion process than those predicted by contemporary models to fit the observed data , then ages of open clusters ( pleiades , @xmath41  persei , and ic 2391 ) estimated from the ldb method are all overestimated .",
    "since an age scale of open clusters is critical and tied into many areas of astronomy , developing self - consistent theoretical models to match the hip  112312 binary system data is an urgent task .",
    "lastly , it is worthwhile mentioning that a low mass secondary component ( m4.5 ) of a previously identified @xmath36  pictoris member ( v343  nor , k0v ) also shows a similarly strong li  6708   feature ( song et al , in prep . ) .",
    "v343  nor  b and hip  112312  b have almost the same spectral types based on the tio5 spectral indices and photometric colors .",
    "study of v343  nor  b corroborates the idea of hip  112312 being a member of the @xmath36  pictoris moving group and the location of the ldb must be at @xmath42m4.5 for @xmath43  myr old stars .",
    "we have identified the li depletion boundary in a @xmath44  myr old pre - main sequence binary system , hip  112312 a & b. from its galactic space motion , young age , and proximity to earth , the hip  112312 binary system may be a member of the @xmath0  myr old @xmath39  pictoris moving group . at the conservative age upper limit of 20  myr ,",
    "all contemporary theoretical evolutionary models predict too slow li depletion .",
    "incorrect model li depletion rates may cause overestimated open cluster ages ( pleiades , @xmath18  persei , and ic  2391 ) from the lithium depletion boundary method . because of the importance of the open cluster age scale , development of self - consistent theoretical models to satisfy hip  112312 binary system data is desirable ."
