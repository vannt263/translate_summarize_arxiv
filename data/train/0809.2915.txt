    "after the collider upgrade in 2000 - 2001 , resulting in a significant increase of luminosity , about 400 @xmath2 of data per experiment were collected in the so called hera  ii phase ( 2002 - 2007 ) .",

    "vector @xmath1 contact interactions considered at hera can be represented as an additional terms in the standard model lagrangian : @xmath6 where the sum runs over electron and quark helicities , and a set of couplings @xmath7 describe the helicity and flavor structure of contact interactions .",
