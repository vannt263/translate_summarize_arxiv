    "in models with low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) , there may exist various long - lived particles ( which we call @xmath1 ) which have very weak interactions with the particles in the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the examples include moduli fields , polonyi field ( responsible for susy breaking ) , gravitino ( which is the superpartner of graviton ) , axino ( which is the superpartner of axion in susy peccei - quinn model ) , and so on . in most of the cases , these particles are irrelevant for low - energy phenomenology because of the weakness of their interactions .",
    "cosmologically , however , they often cause serious problems @xcite because , even though their interactions are very weak , a sizable amount of them may be produced in the early universe .",
    "if they are stable , they survive until today , resulting in the overclosure of the universe .",
    "even if they are unstable , their lifetimes are often so long that they decay at a very late stage of the evolution of the universe .",
    "if they decay after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) starts , hadro- and photo - dissociation processes of light elements induced by their decay products may spoil the success of the bbn scenario . in order to avoid such a problem ,",
    "the lifetime of @xmath1 is required to be shorter than @xmath2 ; otherwise , the abundance of @xmath1 is bounded above @xcite .",
    "even with lifetime shorter than @xmath2 , @xmath1 may cause other cosmological difficulties . in our study , we consider one of such problems : the overproduction of the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) due to its decay . in many cases",
    ", @xmath1 decays into superparticles which cascade down to the lsp .",
    "then , if all the produced lsps survive until today , it is often the case that the resultant mass density of the lsp becomes much larger than the present energy density of dark matter . in particular ,",
    "the universe may be once dominated by @xmath1 before the decay of @xmath1 ; in such a case , the overproduction of the lsp is a serious problem .    if the pair annihilation cross section of the lsp is large enough , the lsps produced by the decay of @xmath1 may annihilate and the abundance of the lsp can be suppressed",
    ". there exists a viable and well - motivated candidate of such lsp , the neutral wino @xmath3 . in models with the naive grand - unified - theory ( gut )",
    "relation among gaugino masses , the wino can not be the lsp .",
    "however , even if the unification of the gauge group is realized , the gut relation can be easily violated in various cases , for example , in the anomaly - mediation model @xcite , product - group unification @xcite , and so on .",
    "in particular , in the light of the recent discovery of the higgs - like particle at the lhc @xcite , the anomaly - mediation model with large scalar masses @xcite ( as large as @xmath4 ) is well - motivated because the relatively large susy higgs mass of @xmath5 can be realized if the scalar tops are so heavy @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the wino can naturally be the lsp in anomaly - mediation model .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsider the possibility of the non - thermally produced wino being dark matter .",
    "in particular , we precisely calculate the relic abundance of the neutral wino .",
    "the possibility of wino dark matter from the decay of long - lived particles was first discussed in @xcite , in which it was shown that the relic density of the wino can be consistent with the dark matter density .",
    "then , such a scenario has been applied to various cases @xcite .",
    "( for the case where the lsp is not wino - like , see also @xcite . )",
    "compared to the previous studies , we have carefully taken into account the following in the calculation of the relic wino abundance :    * coannihilation effect among neutral and charged winos , which becomes important when the decay temperature of @xmath1 is higher than the mass difference between charged and neutral winos . * sommerfeld enhancement of the pair annihilation cross section , which is large when the wino is heavier than @xmath6 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "formulas ] , we show relevant formulas to calculate the relic abundance of neutral wino . in section [ sec : numerical ] , we numerically calculate the relic abundance of the wino for several situations and discuss implications .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "in this section , we summarize the basic formulas to calculate the thermal relic abundance of the neutral wino through the decay of a heavy particle @xmath1 .",
    "the wino is @xmath7-triplet , and there exist neutral and charged winos , denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath8 , respectively . in the present study",
    ", we consider the case where the neutral wino is the lsp ; in the following , we assume that superparticles other than winos are so heavy that they are irrelevant at the time of the freeze - out of winos .",
    "this is the case in the anomaly - mediated model , which is one of the important motivations of our study .",
    "in addition , because we assume that the higgsinos are much heavier than winos , the mass difference between @xmath3 and @xmath8 are dominantly from one - loop diagrams with gauge bosons ( i.e. , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) and winos inside the loop . then , if the wino mass is much smaller than the higgsino mass , the mass difference is typically @xmath12 @xcite , which is insensitive to the wino mass .",
    "because the mass difference is much smaller than the wino mass , the number density of the charged wino at the time of the freeze - out of winos may be sizable .",
    "thus , in the calculation of the relic density of @xmath3 , we include effects of all the possible channels of wino annihilation .",
    "we consider the case where winos are much lighter than other superparticles , so the coannihilation with those are neglected in the calculation of the relic density .",
    "now we discuss the evolution of the number density of wino .",
    "as we mentioned , we consider the case with a long - lived particle @xmath1 which decays into mssm particles .",
    "using the fact that all the mssm superparticles eventually decay into charged or neutral wino , the relevant set of boltzmann equations to calculate the relic abundance of wino lsp is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sum of the number densities of neutral and charged winos , @xmath15 is the number density of @xmath1 , and @xmath16 is a heat injection into radiation as @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the averaged number of susy particles produced by the decay of one @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 is the energy density of the relativistic component , and is related to the cosmic temperature @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom.we use the fact that @xmath23 is numerically very close to @xmath24 , and approximate @xmath25 in our calculation , where @xmath23 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom for the calculation of entropy density , which is related to the entropy density as @xmath26 in our calculation , we approximated that the full particle content at the temperature above the qcd scale ( which is taken to be @xmath27 in our analysis ) is that of the mssm , while that at the temperature below the qcd scale consists of photon , three generations of leptons , and pions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 denotes the thermal - equilibrium value of @xmath14 , @xmath29 is the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath30 is the decay rate of @xmath1 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the masses of @xmath1 and wino , respectively.because we are interested in the case where charged and neutral winos are quite degenerate , we denote the wino masses as @xmath32 as far as we discuss the quantities which are insensitive to the mass difference . in the above boltzmann equations , the thermally - averaged effective annihilation cross section @xmath33 accounts both for the coannihilation effect and the sommerfeld effect ,",
    "which were not fully taken into accounts in previous analyses .",
    "the coannihilation processes are included by summing up the cross sections of all the relevant modes with appropriate weights : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the number density of @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that winos are in kinetic equilibrium ; the energetic winos produced by the @xmath1 decay show non - trivial velocity distribution at first . however , charged winos soon lose their energies through the electromagnetic interactions with the thermal background ( in particular , electron and positron ) as well as through the decay .",
    "in addition , sizable fractions of neutral winos can be thermalized through the inelastic interactions @xcite . in particular , as we see below , @xmath41 is required to be higher than @xmath42 in order to realize @xmath43 in the parameter region where the pair annihilation of the wino becomes effective ; in such a case , the neutral and charged winos are efficiently converted to each other by the charged current processes in the thermal bath , and the charged wino efficently loses its energy by the decay process ( as well as the scattering processes with charged particles in the thermal bath ) .",
    "thus , we expect that the winos reach the kinetic equilibrium . when @xmath44 , @xmath45 if the mass difference between charged and neutral winos @xmath46 is much larger than the background temperature @xmath20 , only the lightest neutral wino is relevant in the annihilation process .",
    "on the other hand , the coannihilation becomes effective for the temperature @xmath47 .    for each annihilation process , thermally averaged cross section is obtained by @xmath48 once the temperature of the universe decreases and the neutral and charged winos become non - relativistic , the wave functions of annihilating wino pairs are significantly deformed by the electroweak potential generated by the electroweak gauge boson exchanges .",
    "the resultant annihilation cross sections , @xmath49 , are significantly enhanced or suppressed due to the sommerfeld effect @xcite .",
    "the sommerfeld effect is more important for larger wino mass , @xmath50 , because the electroweak potential behaves as a long range force in such a mass region . as a result ,",
    "the thermally - averaged cross sections show non - trivial dependence on the cosmic temperature @xmath20 and the wino mass @xmath51",
    ". a two - body system of winos can be classified by the quantum numbers @xmath52 ( electric charge ) and @xmath53 ( spin ) , and the sommerfeld enhancement factors are evaluated for fixed values of these quantum numbers . for each set of @xmath54 ,",
    "possible decay modes and the decay widths are summarized in appendix .",
    "( see table [ tab : cs ] . )",
    "[ fig : cs ]    = 0.6    in fig .",

    "in addition , we can see the resonance structure at around @xmath61 , which occurs due to the existence of zero - energy bound states .",
    "the precise position of the resonance is determined by the structure of the electroweak potential , and depends on the mass difference between charged and neutral winos , @xmath62 . for larger @xmath63 , the resonance peak is shifted to the heavier wino mass .    as is seen from the fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] , the annihilation cross section at the decay temperature can be significantly enhanced by the sommerfeld effect .",
    "we stress here again that once coannihilation and sommerfeld effects are included , the cross sections show non - trivial dependence on @xmath20 . in order to precisely take into account these effects , we solve the boltzmann equations numerically .",
    "the relic density of the neutral wino can be calculated by solving eqs .",
    "@xmath64 with relevant initial condition .",
    "the initial values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath19 depend on cosmological scenarios and the properties of @xmath1 . in the next section ,",
    "we consider several well - motivated scenarios and calculate the relic density by numerically solving the boltzmann equations .",
    "first , we consider the case where the particle @xmath1 once dominates the universe . in such a case , at the cosmic time @xmath65 , the energy density of @xmath1 is much larger than that of radiation , while the energy density of radiation ( i.e. , so - called `` dilute plasma '' ) scales as @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 being the scale factor ) . with such an initial condition , we solve the boltzmann equations to calculate the relic abundance of @xmath3 . in the parameter region of our analysis",

    "( in our numerical calculation , we use @xmath78 @xcite . ) comparing @xmath79 with the present density parameter of dark matter , we derive constraints on the model parameters .",
