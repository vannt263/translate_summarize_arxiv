    "over the last decade , a wealth of evidence was accumulated in favour of the conclusion that the expansion of our universe is accelerating , mainly from the observation of the type - ia supernovae @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite in combination with measurements of the hubble constant and large - scale structures ( lss ) @xcite . assuming the validity of general relativity on large scales , a possible explanation for this accelerating expansion , is obtained by introducing a component of the cosmic fluid , the dark energy , with equation - of - state parameter @xmath3 .    despite efforts from both observational and theoretical sides",
    ", the nature of the dark energy remains obscure .",
    "consequently , a plethora of different models has been proposed for the origin and the time evolution of the dark energy , see for example @xcite for a comprehensive review .",
    "the simplest model assumes that the dark energy is connected with the vacuum energy , the so called cosmological constant , with equation - of - state parameter @xmath4 .",
    "despite the fact that observations constrain the present value of @xmath5 quite tightly , the time evolution of the equation - of - state parameter is rather poorly constrained .",
    "thus , it is natural to study more general classes of models allowing a time evolution of the dark - energy component , such as models involving scalar fields .",
    "scalar fields occur naturally in particle physics and in string theory and could thus be candidates to explain the nature of the dark - energy if they are sufficiently strongly self - interacting .",
    "this class includes quintessence models , phantom models , k - essence , tachyon models and so forth .",
    "scalar fields are described by their lagrangian density with a kinetic term @xmath6 and a potential term @xmath7 .",
    "the equation - of - state parameter then follows from the canonical energy - momentum tensor .",
    "if the dark energy is spatially homogeneous , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , giving @xmath10 .    the cosmological - constant case is recovered if the kinetic energy is negligibly small compared to the potential energy .",
    "dark energy affects first of all the expansion rate , causing geometrical effects that can be revealed through distance measurements , such as the luminosity distance to distant supernovae .",
    "secondly , it affects structure formation , the early stages of which can be quantified by the growth factor .",
    "thus , structure formation will be affected by the amount of dark energy and by its dynamical evolution over cosmic history .",
    "one model recently suggested as a candidate for solving the fine - tuning problem of the cosmological constant was the class of early dark - energy cosmologies ( ede ) @xcite , according to which the contribution of dark energy at early times is not negligible .",
    "thus , to produce the same amount of structure now , structure formation should start earlier and proceed more slowly than in the common @xmath2cdm model .",
    "it would thus compensate the additional , opposing effects of the early dark - energy contribution .",
    "an analytic calculation based on the evolution equation for the radius of a spherical , homogeneous perturbation and various assumptions @xcite implied a substantial increase in the number of objects compared to a standard @xmath2cdm model . while this expectation was confirmed by @xcite , subsequent @xmath11-body simulations by @xcite and @xcite found instead that the effect of ede on the mass function of dark - matter haloes and its evolution is almost negligible : the ede class of models predicts differences in the mass function of only a few percent with respect to the @xmath2cdm model . a new numerical derivation of the linear overdensity parameter , also based on the differential equations of the spherical collapse model @xcite was in perfect agreement with the numerical simulations .",
    "motivated in part by this discrepancy of results derived from the same model , we are here addressing the problem of determining the time evolution of the linear overdensity @xmath12 in a completely different way , using a perturbative approach based on newtonian hydrodynamics directly .",
    "one of the advantages , apart from increased numerical stability , is that no time - reversal symmetry needs to be assumed for the spherical collapse .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : nhydro ] , we present the basic equations of newtonian hydrodynamics and sketch the derivation of the equations used to obtain the linear over density threshold @xmath13 and the non - linear virial overdensity parameter @xmath14 . in sect .  [",
    "sect : models ] , we briefly describe and motivate the cosmological models investigated in this work , while we compare them in sect .",
    "[ sect : res ] with the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "we present our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ sect : conc ] . in the appendix [",
    "sect : app ] , we discuss why the previous theoretical estimations of @xmath0 for the ede models obtained by @xcite and @xcite differ from the results obtained in this work and by @xcite .",
    "we review here the derivation of the differential equation determining the evolution of an overdensity @xmath15 .",
    "the final non - linear equation specialised to @xmath16 is not new , but has already been used by several authors in the context of structure formation @xcite and for the study of the spherical and ellipsoidal collapse @xcite .",
    "the linearised equation was presented in @xcite specialised for two limiting cases , namely dust ( @xmath16 ) and relativistic matter ( @xmath17 ) , and in @xcite for a general model with constant @xmath5 .",
    "our study , based on the work by @xcite where the equation for the evolution of the overdensity @xmath15 was generalised to allow for time - dependent equation - of - state for the dark energy component , has two novel aspects : first , we generalise the evolution equation to a generic collapse geometry , rendering the spherical and ellipsoidal models special cases .",
    "second , the newly obtained generality of the method allows its application to modified - gravity cosmologies and coupled - quintessence models .",
    "this will be postponed to future work .    following the work by @xcite",
    ", we derive our equation including the pressure terms explicitly and assuming that the fluid satisfies the equation - of - state @xmath18 . starting from this point",
    ", the final equation will be in its most general form and can then be specified to a particular fluid simply by adopting the appropriate equation - of - state .",
    "we start from the continuity equation for the energy - momentum tensor in general relativity , @xmath19 . for a perfect fluid",
    ", we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the density of the fluid , @xmath22 its pressure , @xmath23 its 4-velocity and @xmath24 the metric .",
    "contracting the continuity equation once with @xmath25 and once with the projection operator @xmath26 one obtains the relativistic expressions for the continuity and the euler equations , respectively : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the velocity in three - space , @xmath29 is the newtonian gravitational potential and @xmath30 is the physical coordinate .",
    "the @xmath31-@xmath31 component of einstein s field equations gives the relativistic poisson equation @xmath32 the continuity equation for the mean background density , obtained from the spatial components of einstein s equations , is now modified to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the background mass density of all contributions to the cosmic fluid , and @xmath35 is its density parameter .",

    "next , taking the time derivative of the continuity equation ( [ eq : pertcont ] ) and combining all three equations , we arrive at the fully non - linear evolution equation @xmath45 note that the shear is a symmetric traceless tensor , while the rotation is antisymmetric .",
    "they read @xmath46 specialising eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nleq ] ) for dust ( @xmath16 ) , we recover eq .",
    "( 41 ) of @xcite .",
    "we notice that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nleq ] ) generalises eq .",
    "( 7 ) of @xcite to the case of a non - spherical configuration of a rotating fluid .    changing the independent variable from the time @xmath47 to the scale factor @xmath48 using the relation @xmath49",
    ", the evolution equation assumes the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the density parameter of the fluid at @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is a function specifying the time evolution of the dark - energy model considered .    in the following , since we are interested in the collapse of a homogeneous sphere , we ignore the rotation and the shear tensors .",
    "the shear tensor vanishes for a sphere anyway .",
    "we will also restrict the treatment to spherical perturbation filled with dust , having @xmath16 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the non - linear equation to be solved reads @xmath55    we notice that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wnldeq ] ) has a singularity when @xmath4 . to see what happens for the cosmological constant , we multiply both sides with @xmath56 and then specialise to @xmath4 .",
    "we obtain @xmath57 , implying @xmath58 , and with appropriate initial conditions , the constant can be set to zero , so the cosmological constant can not clump as expected .      the linearised eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nldeq ] ) reads @xmath59 and its solution , for appropriate initial conditions , will give the _ linear _ overdensity parameter @xmath15 at any point in time .",
    "this equation is also used to determine the time evolution of the growth factor if suitable initial conditions are used .    to determine the appropriate initial conditions , we start by considering eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nldeq ] ) .",
    "we know that , since this represents the non - linear evolution of the density contrast , its value at a some chosen collapse time diverges , @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we search for an initial density contrast such that the @xmath15 solving the non - linear equation diverges at the chosen collapse time .",
    "numerically , we assume this to be achieved once @xmath61 .",
    "since the curve @xmath62 representing the non - linear density evolution turns very steep towards the collapse , the result is very insensitive to the exact choice of this threshold value as long as it is a large number .",
    "once the initial overdensity is found , we use this value as an initial condition in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ldeq ] ) to find @xmath0 .",
    "since we are dealing with second - order equations , two initial values have to be given , one for the initial overdensity @xmath63 and the other for the initial rate of evolution , @xmath64 . we know that initially , @xmath64 for the sphere should be small , thus we set it to @xmath65 , corresponding to the initial scale factor used for starting the integration of the two differential equations .",
    "we carried out several numerical tests to check the dependence of the solution on @xmath64 and found that the result does not depend on the precise value of @xmath66 .",
    "specifically , we considered several values in the interval between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and saw perfect convergence of the solution . also setting @xmath69 ,",
    "the result does not change considerably .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] , we show the solution @xmath15 of the non - linear ( cyan short - dashed curve ) and the linear ( blue dashed curve ) evolution equations as a function of the scale factor , for an eds model , supposing that the sphere collapses at @xmath70 .",
    "we see that the linear solution grows linearly with time , reaching the correct value for @xmath71 at the collapse scale factor , while , after developing in parallel initially , the non - linear solution starts deviating and growing exponentially . to obtain the virial overdensity ,",
    "supposing that dark energy does not clump , we follow the prescription of @xcite , which generalises the work by @xcite .    knowing the non - linear time evolution , it is possible to infer all the other properties of the collapsing sphere , in particular the time evolution of the radius , the turn - around scale factor",
    "@xmath72 when the sphere reaches its maximum radius , and the overdensity at turn - around @xmath73 .",
    "the virial overdensity is defined as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the normalised scale factor and @xmath76 is the radius of the sphere normalised to its value at the turn - around .    to determine the turn - around scale factor , we solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wnldeq ] ) and determine the quantity @xmath77 .",
    "apart from a multiplicative constant , this is the inverse of the collapsing sphere s radius and assumes a minimum at the turn - around scale factor @xmath72 . to determine the virial overdensity at turn - around @xmath73",
    ", we integrate eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wnldeq ] ) up to @xmath72 and add the result to unity .",
    "as mentioned before , the nature of the dark energy is still unknown , which leaves room for a plethora of phenomenological or _ ad hoc _ models being discussed in the literature . here",
    ", we briefly review some models , characterised by the requirements that they try to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe in terms of a smooth and slowly varying component , the dark energy , quantified by a certain equation - of - state parameter @xmath78 and formulated in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the dark - energy component satisfies the following evolution equation @xmath79 our collection of models is based on the works by @xcite and @xcite where @xmath11-body simulations of different quintessence models are studied .",
    "we shall use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "for flat models @xmath82 , while for models with a curvature term we set @xmath83 .      the simplest model used to fit the data that explains the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe has a cosmological constant , with equation - of - state parameter @xmath4 independent of time .",
    "because of this , the contribution of the cosmological constant starts dominating only recently and becomes rapidly negligible towards higher redshift , such that , at high redshift , it converges towards the eds model . despite conceptual problems associated with it ,",
    "it is currently the simplest model fitting virtually all available observational data .",
    "we shall thus assume a spatially flat @xmath2cdm model as a reference model , since observations suggest negligible spatial curvature .",
    "however , we will also consider finite curvature , even if this parameter , according to the current limits , is quite small .      an immediate extension of the cosmological - constant scenario is described by a scalar field very weakly or not interacting with the matter component .",
    "this scalar field can be in principle the inflaton itself , even if the vast majority of the scenarios assumes it to be independent of the scalar field actually driving the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "these models are described by a kinetic energy and a potential energy characterised by a given functional form , that can either be motivated by theory or introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ , such as power - law potentials",
    ". the equivalent mass of the scalar field is given by the second derivative of the potential term .",
    "compared to the cosmological - constant case , these models have a time - evolving equation - of - state parameter .",
    "they are justified by the fact that a time - dependent equation - of - state parameter , not excluded by observations , naturally arises in the framework of a scalar field theory .",
    "it is assumed that dark energy does not clump , at least not on the relevant scales accessible to cosmological studies .",
    "the sound speed of quintessence models is directly related to the equation - of - state parameter by the relation @xmath84 .    here , together with the early dark - energy models ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : ede ] ) , we study the six models used by @xcite to which we refer the reader for more detail .",
    "all models can be divided into two broad classes , tracking scalar fields @xcite and scaling fields @xcite .",
    "tracker fields are characterised by a scalar field rolling down its potential reaching an attractor solution .",
    "an interesting feature is that the scalar field tracks the dominant component of the cosmic fluid .",
    "the second class instead keeps the ratio between the density of the scalar field and that of the background constant .",

    "we argue that a possible enhancement in structure formation might be caused by rapidly varying or discontinuous equation - of - state parameters , for example if they contain bumps or peaks . from a physical point of view",

    "it is also interesting to see that the equation - of - state parameter has very little impact on the evolution of @xmath13 .",
    "we argue that this can be due to the fact that the equation - of - state parameter is always integrated over and thus its effects are smoothed over cosmic history .",
    "it would be interesting to work out with the equations governing the evolution of the overdensity which conditions must be satisfied by the equation - of - state parameter to have significant effects on @xmath13 .",
    "the same considerations apply to the virial overdensity @xmath14 . deviations at low redshift are at most of the order of a few percent , thus having negligible impact on non - linear structure evolution .",
    "this fact has also a practical advantage : all quantities depending on @xmath14 will be virtually unaffected if the virial overdensity of the @xmath2cdm model is used as an approximation .",

    "hence , the conclusions on the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , lensing @xcite and clustering @xcite are based on erroneous assumptions .",
    "in the previous section , we studied the impact of different dark energy models on the linear overdensity threshold @xmath13 .",
    "a quantity closely related to observations is the mass function , representing the number of collapsed objects per unit mass and volume .",
    "since it only depends on @xmath13 and on the growth factor , no appreciable differences are expected between the models studied .",
    "an important quantity that can be derived from observations is the total number of haloes above a given mass in a complete survey volume .",
    "the minimum mass detectable in a survey is generally a function of redshift and changes with the observed wave band ; moreover , it will also depend on the survey according to the instrument sensitivity . since we do not intend to specify an individual survey here",
    ", we assume the minimum mass to be independent of redshift .",
    "an idealisation in this approach is that the catalogue of objects is considered to be complete in order to compare observations with theoretical predictions .",
    "the cumulative number of haloes above a given mass @xmath135 is @xmath136 where @xmath137 represents the differential mass function and @xmath138 the volume element .",
    "since dark energy does not only affect the growth history but also the geometry , we expect that the contribution of volume effects on observable quantities will provide more information than merely the differential mass function .",
    "effects on the number of observable haloes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] . in the top left panel",
    ", we show the ratio of the cumulative mass function above a given mass integrated between @xmath70 and @xmath139 between some of the dark energy models studied and the reference @xmath2cdm model .",
    "the top right panel shows the volume effect for the corresponding models , i.e.  the ratio between the volumes of the dark - energy and the @xmath2cdm models . in the bottom panels , we show the contribution to the number counts in spherical shells enclosing a volume between @xmath70 and @xmath140 ( left panel ) and @xmath140 and @xmath139 ( right panel )",
    ". please see the figure caption for details on the models considered .    in the press & schechter formalism , the cosmological information , and hence the dark energy contribution ,",
    "is contained in the quantity @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the growth factor . to compare the different models",
    ", we thus fix the variance for the @xmath2cdm model ( @xmath143 ) and scale the variance of the dark energy models according to ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath144 due to the relatively small differences in terms of @xmath145 , the normalisations differ by a few percent at most .    even if the differential mass functions differ only slightly , we note that differences in the number counts are as large as @xmath146 .",
    "this is mainly due to volume effects , as shown in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] . models with a non - phantom equation of state always have a smaller volume than the @xmath2cdm model because the expansion rate is lower , while the opposite holds for phantom models ( dot - dot - dashed brown curve ) .",
    "since differences in the mass function are expected only in the high - mass tail , we can safely assume that the number of small objects is approximately the same for all the models .",
    "thus , for low mass haloes , the non - phantom dark energy models predict fewer objects , but for objects above @xmath147 , the exponential tail of the mass function compensates the smaller volume , and we see that a larger number of high - mass objects is expected .",
    "of course , for the phantom models , the results are reversed .",
    "we expect more objects at low mass and fewer at high mass , since they do not have time to assemble .    from an observational point of view , it is also interesting to determine in which redshift interval we expect the highest contribution",
    ". this is shown in the lower panels .",
    "we normalise to the @xmath2cdm counts integrated over the same redshift interval as the dark - energy models , thus the sum of the two panels does not reproduce the top left panel .",
    "it is clear from the bottom right panel that the major contribution comes from high redshifts , while we do not expect more than @xmath148 difference from the volume up to @xmath140 . once again , for the phantom models , the situation is reversed .",
    "despite the fact that differences in number counts are not negligible and systematic , we have to recall that they are of the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty in the determination of halo masses .",
    "it will therefore still be difficult to discriminate between the models studied .",
    "in this work , we have generalised the non - linear equation governing the evolution of matter overdensities to cosmological models containing fluids with an arbitrary equation - of - state parameter .",
    "specifying @xmath16 , we recover the well - known equation for structure formation in matter - dominated universes . by means of the non - linear evolution equation",
    ", we determine the appropriate initial conditions used to solve the linear equation and compute the linear threshold for collapse , @xmath13 .",
    "we point out that the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nldeq ] ) is very general and can be extended to very broad classes of cosmological models , once the appropriate continuity , euler , poisson and background equations are provided .    in this work",
    ", we considered exclusively non - clustering dark energy models , in which the only clustering component is the dark matter .",
    "our goal was to study a whole catalogue of dynamical dark - energy models , thereby summarising results partly obtained elsewhere , and to clarify discrepant results on early dark - energy models .",
    "we stuck to the common assumption that the sound speed in the dark energy is given by the equation of state .",
    "there are more general scenarios allowing perturbations also in the dark - energy component , and this might lead to important differences compared to the case of non - clustering dark energy @xcite .",
    "if the dark - energy component is not homogeneous , one might wonder what happens to the number counts if the equation of state of the dark - energy fluid changes within the collapsing sphere .",
    "then , the equation of state will depend on the actual overdensity of the dark energy , and the model will acquire an additional degree of freedom , parametrised by the effective sound speed defined by @xmath149 .",
    "theoretical predictions for the equation of state inside the collapsing sphere are given by @xcite , and a determination of the effective sound speed in sunyaev - zeldovich and weak - lensing surveys is carried out in @xcite .",
    "the authors found that a negative pressure perturbation to the dark energy fluid may have a substantial effect on the number counts as shown in their fig .  1",
    ". a negative effective sound speed @xmath150 can lower the value of @xmath0 to @xmath151 , giving a substantial boost to structure formation .",
    "volume effects will still be comparable with what we found here .",
    "it may then be possible to descriminate this class of models compared to those studied here .    despite the fact that the differential mass functions are very similar because of the small differences in @xmath13",
    ", we still expect a significant difference for the total number of objects in a given volume above a given mass threshold . for low minimum mass ,",
    "the volume effects dominate and we expect a lower overall number of objects , while the mass function dominates over the volume effect at the high - mass tail , and we still expect more haloes . unfortunately , as shown in the lower panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : mf ] , the major contributions come from redshifts above @xmath140 , where fewer objects are expected and where observations are more difficult .",
    "we found that all models studied here show differences at the per - cent level compared to the standard @xmath2cdm model .",
    "we also argue that in the framework of general relativity , it may be possible to have a more pronounced impact on non - linear structure formation if the equation - of - state parameter is discontinuous or if modifications to general relativity are involved .",
    "this will be the subject of future work .",
    "we thus conclude that , at least for the wide class of models studied here and due to the current status of observations , it is quite difficult to use number counts to discriminate between different dark - energy models . a discrimination may still be possible to eventually based on geometrical tests where volume effects are relevant .",
