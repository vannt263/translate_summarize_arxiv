    "supersymmetry  ( susy ) is a well - motivated and elegant possibility for new physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "however , susy can only be an approximate symmetry of nature .",
    "the requirement of ( soft ) susy breaking introduces many new unconstrained parameters to the theory that can be phenomenologically problematic .",
    "for example , generic soft supersymmetry breaking couplings of @xmath7 size would lead to excessive amounts of flavor mixing and cp violation  @xcite .    a simple way to address",
    "this flavor - mixing problem of low - energy supersymmetry is to arrange for all the matter scalar soft terms to vanish at a common input scale @xmath8 .",
    "provided this input scale is well above the electroweak scale , acceptably large scalar soft terms will be regenerated in the course of renormalization group running from the high scale to the scale of the soft supersymmetry breaking couplings  @xcite . since the scalar soft terms generated in this way come mostly from loops of gauginos , they are nearly flavor universal and therefore consistent with the current bounds on flavor mixing .",
    "this scenario for addressing the susy flavor problem is realized within higgs - exempt no - scale supersymmetry  ( hens )  @xcite . in this model , the squark and",
    "slepton soft terms all vanish at a high input scale , taken to be the scale of unification @xmath9 , while the gaugino masses are non - zero there .",
    "this can be achieved within an extra - dimensional setup as in gaugino mediation  @xcite , or by nearly conformal running  @xcite . however , unlike pure gaugino mediation and traditional no - scale models , the higgs scalar squared masses are allowed to be non - vanishing at the input scale @xmath10 . with this small modification ,",
    "that does not contribute appreciably to flavor mixing , it is possible to obtain a cosmologically - favored neutralino lsp  @xcite . under the assumption of gaugino universality ,",
    "the free parameters of the hens model at the input scale @xmath10 are ,  m_h_u^2 ,  m_h_d^2 ,  m_1/2 ,  sgn ( ) , where @xmath11 is the universal gaugino mass . with this small number of inputs ,",
    "the hens model is able to account for the dark matter , can be made consistent with all current experimental bounds , and leads to exciting collider phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "while the hens model is phenomenologically enticing , it can not explain the observation of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming can be resolved by supplementing the model with three heavy singlet right - handed neutrino chiral superfields with the superpotential couplings w = w_0+ny_l h_u + nm_nn,[suppo ] where @xmath12 is the mssm superpotential , @xmath13 are the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath14 is their majorana mass matrix , and @xmath15 is the neutrino yukawa matrix . by taking the singlet neutrino masses @xmath16 to be much larger than the electroweak scale , very small masses can be generated for the left - handed neutrinos by the seesaw mechanism  @xcite . integrating out the heavy neutrino states",
    "yields the effective superpotential coupling w_eff = w_0-(y_^tm_n^-1y_)_ij(l_ih_u)(l_jh_u ) .",
    "[ weff ] for @xmath17 , this interaction can generate correct light neutrino masses at the weak scale with the neutrino yukawa couplings on the order of unity , @xmath18 .",
    "adding heavy right - handed neutrinos to the hens scenario also introduces a new flavor - mixing problem to the model . in running the soft parameters in the full theory ( eq .  ) from the input scale @xmath10 down to the heavy singlet neutrino scale @xmath14 ,",
    "the neutrino yukawa couplings generate non - universal contributions to the soft masses for the charged leptons  @xcite .",
    "such couplings are dangerous because they are a source of lepton flavor violation  ( lfv )  @xcite , for which the experimental bounds are extremely strong .",
    "this in turn imposes stringent constraints on the heavy neutrino sector .",
    "although adding right - handed neutrinos to susy models can lead to problematic lfv rates , such extensions also have some attractive collateral features .",
    "one of these is the possibility of generating the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "heavy right - handed neutrinos provide all the necessary ingredients for baryogenesis .",
    "lepton number is not a conserved quantity in the neutrino sector since the majorana masses of the heavy right - handed neutrinos violate lepton number @xmath19 by two units .",
    "combined with the @xmath20-violation due to @xmath21 sphaleron transitions in the early universe  @xcite , there exists a source of baryon number violation .",
    "the neutrino sector also provides a new source of cp violation from the complex neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "this cp violation can manifest itself in the out - of - equilibrium decays and scatterings of the right - handed neutrinos in the early universe .",
    "together , these features fulfill the three sakharov conditions for baryogenesis  @xcite , which can be realized through the mechanism of leptogenesis .",
    "requiring that the neutrino - extended hens ( @xmath22hens ) model account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe while respecting the current bounds on lfv leads to constraints on the structure of the neutrino yukawa matrix and the right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "previous studies combining the requirements for leptogenesis with the bounds from lfv can be found in refs .",
    "compared to these previous works , we study the constraints from lfv within the context of a specific model for which the lack of flavor mixing outside the neutrino sector is well - motivated . an interesting result along these lines is that the amount of lfv in the hens model is largely controlled by the value of @xmath23 at the high input scale .",
    "the degree to which the neutrino sector parameters are constrained therefore depends strongly on the size of @xmath23 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ lfvhn ]",
    "we investigate lfv in the hens model induced by the inclusion of heavy right - handed neutrinos . using the current bounds on lfv processes , we obtain constraints on the underlying model . in section  [ thelep ]",
    "we investigate whether it is possible for the hens model with right - handed neutrinos to account for the baryon asymmetry by way of thermal leptogenesis .",
    "we combine the results of sections  [ lfvhn ] and [ thelep ] in section  [ leplfv ] , where we examine whether leptogenesis can generate the baryon asymmetry while satisfying bounds from lfv .",
    "finally , section  [ concl ] is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "we begin by considering the constraints on the hens model from lfv induced by the inclusion of heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "these constraints depend strongly on the parameters in the neutrino sector such as the majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos and the neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "some of these neutrino sector parameters have been determined by the measurements of the light neutrino mass differences and mixings  @xcite . in anticipation of computing the lfv constraints ,",

    "note that since these angles are complex , the components of @xmath32 are not bounded in magnitude .",
    "this means that some of the entries in the neutrino yukawa matrix could be quite large , but through cancellations among the see - saw contributions , still give rise to acceptably small light neutrino masses . in order to avoid too much fine - tuning in this regard",
    ", we will only consider @xmath32 matrices with @xmath38 , which corresponds roughly to a tuning of less than @xmath39 in the light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "our choices for the light neutrino masses and mixings are listed in appendix a.      without heavy right - handed neutrinos , the hens model is safe in terms of lepton - flavor violation ( lfv ) . with heavy right - handed neutrinos , lepton - flavor violating couplings can arise among the scalar soft terms in the course of renormalization group  ( rg ) running down from the input scale @xmath10 .",
    "the strict experimental limits on lfv will in turn lead to constraints on the neutrino yukawa couplings and right - handed neutrino masses . since this new source of fcnc in the hens model arises from rg running , and not the susy breaking mechanism",
    ", its amplitude will have a similar form to that found in msugra models .",

    "in the previous two sections we have examined the lfv constraints on the hens model with heavy right - handed neutrinos , and we have investigated whether this model can account for the baryon asymmetry through thermal leptogenesis . in the present section , we combine these considerations , and study whether the hens model can be successful in both regards at the same time . to be concrete , we focus on two particular points in the hens parameter space . for these points",

    "either @xmath23 must be somewhat small or the neutrino yukawa matrix must have a special structure .",
    "these constraints will be strengthened by current and upcoming searches for lepton flavor violation .",
    "our focus has been on enabling a theoretical idea ( hens ) to be compatible with additional phenomenological requirements ( neutrino masses and small lfv ) and explanatory opportunities ( baryon asymmetry ) . throughout this work , however , it should be noted that even though the hens idea started out by minimizing lfv in low - scale supersymmetric theories , full compatibility with nature reintroduced flavor violations through neutrino yukawa effects .",
    "this is a generic feature of supersymmetric theories that explicitly incorporate neutrino masses in the spectrum .",
    "as explained above , we find lfv bounds nontrivial to satisfy if the baryon asymmetry of the universe originates from thermal leptogenesis with hierarchical right - handed neutrinos . in our view , this highlights in yet another context the importance of making progress in lfv experiments whose non - zero signal upon reaching better sensitivity will be complementary to the knowledge gained from high - energy lhc experiments and will be necessary to unravel the underlying theory .",

    "<S> motivated by the observation of neutrino oscillations , we extend the higgs boson exempt no - scale supersymmetry model ( hens ) by adding three heavy right - handed neutrino chiral supermultiplets to generate the light neutrino masses and mixings . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino yukawa couplings can induce new lepton flavor violating couplings among the soft terms in the course of renormalization group running down from the boundary scale . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects this has on the predictions for low - energy probes of lepton flavor violation  ( lfv ) . </S>",
    "<S> heavy right - handed neutrinos also provide a way to generate the baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that consistency with lfv and leptogenesis puts strong requirements on either the form of the yukawa mass matrix or the smallness of the higgs up soft mass . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> , we generically expect that new physics lfv is non - zero and can be found in a future experiment .    </S>",
