    "in recent years loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) has inspired realisation of the cosmological scenario in which the initial singularity is replaced by the bounce . in this picture , the universe is initially in the contracting phase , reaches the minimal , nonzero volume and , thanks to quantum repulsion , evolves toward the expanding phase .",
    "such a scenario has been extensively studied with use of the numerical methods @xcite . however , as it was shown for example in @xcite exact solutions for bouncing universe with dust and cosmological constant can be found .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that analytical solutions can also be obtained for the bouncing models arising from lqc .",
    "the main advantage of such exact solutions is that they allow for investigations in whole ranges of the parameter domains .    in this paper",
    "we consider the flat frw model with a free scalar field and with the cosmological constant .",
    "quantum effects are introduced in terms of correction to the classical theory .",
    "generally one considers two types of of quantum correction : correction from inverse volume and holonomy corrections .",
    "the leading effect of the volume corrections is the appearance of the super - inflationary phase .",
    "the effect of holonomy corrections , on the other hand , is the appearance of a bounce instead of singularity .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate analytically these effects in a flat frw model .",
    "that is to say , we neglect corrections from inverse volume , these effects however , has been extensively studied elsewhere . moreover , these two types of corrections are not equally important in the same regimes .",
    "the inverse volume corrections are mainly important for small values of the scale factor , whereas holonomy corrections are mainly important for large values of the hubble parameter .",
    "in other words , when the minimal scale factor ( during the bounce ) is large enough , the effects of inverse volume corrections can be neglected .",
    "the flat frw model in the loop quantum cosmology has been first investigated in the pioneer works of bojowald @xcite and later improved in the works of ashtekar , pawowski and singh @xcite .",
    "bojowald s original description of the quantum universe in currently explored in the number of works and regarded as a parallel line of research @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the flat frw models arising in the framework proposed by ashtekar and co - workers . beside the flat models",
    "this approach has also been applied to the frw @xmath2 models in @xcite and bianchi i in @xcite . in these models",

    "in the present paper we consider two kind of approaches to this problem : the so called @xmath3scheme and @xmath4scheme ( for a more detailed description see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) .",
