    "@xcite understanding the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of hard particle systems is of great interest .",
    "this is reflected by the numerous studies devoted to these topics for nonspherical particles that span a wide range of shapes , including ellipsoids , superballs , and polyhedra .",
    "@xcite nanoparticles and colloidal particles of various shapes can now be routinely synthesized in the laboratory .",
    "@xcite    in general , a packing is defined as a large collection of nonoverlapping solid objects ( particles ) in d - dimensional euclidean space @xmath4 . the associated packing fraction ( or density ) @xmath5 is defined as the fraction of space @xmath4 covered by the particles .",
    "the densest packing of a specific particle shape , which is usually achieved by an ordered arrangement depending on the particle symmetry , @xcite is the thermodynamic stable phase of that shape in the infinite - pressure limit , @xcite and thus provides the starting point to determine the entire high - density phase behavior of the system . on the other hand , the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) state of packing",
    "can be considered to be a prototypical glass .",
    "@xcite roughly speaking , mrj packings can be obtained by compressing liquid configurations at the largest possible rate such that the packing is strictly jammed ( i.e. , mechanically stable ) .",
    "@xcite    the hard - sphere model in @xmath6 has a venerable history .",
    "@xcite it is well known from numerical simulations that such a system exhibits a first - order liquid - crystal phase transition as the density increases along the liquid branch .",
    "the associated freezing- and melting - point packing fractions have been determined to be around 0.49 and 0.55 , respectively , by both pressure and free - energy calculations .",
    "@xcite at the maximal density , free - energy calculations have been used to demonstrate that the face - centered cubic crystal ( fcc ) is very slightly more stable than the hexagonal close - packed crystal .",
    "@xcite upon rapid compression from a liquid configuration , the system falls out of equilibrium and follows a metastable branch , whose end state is presumably the mrj state in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "@xcite the aforementioned equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of the hard - sphere system are schematically illustrated in figure [ fig_sphere_phase ] .",
    "since nonspherical particles have both translational and rotational degrees of freedom , they usually have a richer phase diagram than spheres , i.e. , the former can possess different degrees of translational and orientational order .",
    "for example , a rotator ( or plastic ) phase is one in which particles possess translational order but can rotate freely .",
    "@xcite a nematic phase is one in which the particles are aligned ( i.e. , with orientational order ) while the system lacks any long - range translational order .",
    "@xcite a smectic phase is one in which particles have ordered orientations and possess translational order in one direction .",
    "@xcite the types of phases formed by hard nonspherical particles are influenced by many factors .",
    "it is well known that entropy plays a principal role in determining the phase behavior of hard - particle systems .",
    "for example , spheroids ( ellipsoids of revolution ) with needle - like shapes exhibit a liquid - nematic phase transition at low densities . @xcite while more recent studies @xcite have also revealed that spheroids with shapes closer to spheres exhibit a liquid - rotator crystal phase transition at intermediate densities .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the local curvature of the particle shape contributes to the stabilization of rotator phases by studies of superballs at intermediate densities .",
    "@xcite gantapara et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the phase diagram of truncated cubes exhibits a rich diversity in crystal structures that depend sensitively on the amount of truncation .",

    "an archimedean truncated tetrahedron ( henceforth often called a truncated tetrahedron for simplicity ) is obtained by truncating the corners of a regular tetrahedron with edge length that is one - third of the edge length of the original tetrahedron , and it therefore has four regular triangular faces and four hexagonal faces .",
    "it is of particular interest because it is the only nonchiral archimedean solid without central symmetry and , as we will discuss , packings of truncated tetrahedra can nearly fill all of space .",
    "some geometrical properties of the truncated tetrahedron , including the inradius @xmath7 , circumradius @xmath9 , asphericity @xmath20 , radius of mean curvature @xmath13 , @xcite surface area @xmath15 , volume v , and scaled exclusion volume @xmath18 , @xcite are summarized in table [ tab_geo_param ] .",

    "given that this packing fraction is nearly equal to unity and truncated tetrahedra can not tile three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath23 , this densest known packing is likely the densest packing for such solids . in the same paper , the equilibrium melting properties of truncated tetrahedra were also qualitatively studied by simply monitoring the structural changes upon decompression from the densest known packing .",
    "they found that the system apparently undergoes a transition to another crystal phase , namely the one associated with the packing of truncated tetrahedra discovered by conway and torquato @xcite ( henceforth referred to as `` ct crystal '' ) as well .",
    "figure [ fig_phases ] shows a portion of the ct packing and the densest known packing .",
    "however , only free - energy calculations can yield quantitatively accurate information about the phase behavior of truncated tetrahedra over the entire range of densities .    in the present work ,",
    "we employ a monte carlo implementation of the adaptive - shrinking - cell ( asc ) numerical scheme @xcite and free - energy calculations @xcite to investigate with high precision the equilibrium phase behavior of truncated tetrahedra and to verify whether the types of phases found in ref   are indeed thermodynamically stable .",
    "consistent with the findings of ref  , we find that the system undergoes two first - order phase transitions as the density increases : first a liquid - solid transition and then a solid - solid transition .",
    "the isotropic liquid phase coexists with the conway - torquato ( ct ) crystal phase with densities in the range @xmath24 $ ] . at higher densities",
    ", the ct phase coexists with the one associated with the densest - known crystal with densities in the range @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "we find no evidence for stable rotator or nematic phases .",
    "moreover , we also generate maximally random jammed packings of truncated tetrahedra using asc simulations with a sufficient large compression rate and study their characteristics , including the packing fraction , centroidal pair correlation function , structure factor and orientational correlation function .",
    "we find that the mrj packings are hyperuniform @xcite ( see section v for definitions and details ) . in closing , we explain why truncated tetrahedra are expected to have the two types of first - order phase transitions reported here .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the simulation methods used in studying the phase behavior of truncated tetrahedra . in section iii , we discuss the structural descriptors used to characterize equilibrium and mrj packings of truncated tetrahedra . in section iv , we study the equilibrium phase behavior of truncated tetrahedra using asc simulations and free - energy calculations . in section",
    "v , we generate and characterize mrj packings of truncated tetrahedra . in section",
    "vi , we provide concluding remarks and make some simple observations concerning what types of phase transitions might be expected in general hard - particle systems based on the particle shape .",
    "the adaptive - shrinking - cell ( asc ) monte carlo method is employed to equilibrate hard truncated tetrahedra at different packing fractions .",
    "while we sketch the procedure here , the reader is referred to ref   for additional details . along the liquid branch , initially a system at each packing fraction is generated by compressing dilute disordered particle configurations with @xmath26 in a simulation box subject to periodic boundary conditions . along the crystal branch , initially a system at each packing fraction is generated by dilating the densest crystal of the particles in a simulation box subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our asc scheme is capable of shrinking the simulation box , but we do not employ that feature for the determination of the phase behavior ( just use it for the generation of mrj states , as described in section v ) .",
    "the initial systems at fixed densities are equilibrated by particle trial moves and volume - preserving shear deformations of the simulation box .",
    "specifically , for a fixed simulation box , each particle is sequentially randomly displaced and rotated by small amounts .",
    "a trial move is rejected if it results in overlap between a pair of particles and is accepted otherwise . the _ separation axis theorem _",
    "( sat ) @xcite is used to check overlaps . after a prescribed number of trial - move cycles",
    ", the boundary of the periodic simulation box ( fundamental cell ) is allowed to deform by specified small amount .",
    "such a boundary move is accepted if no overlaps between any pair of particles in the system occur and is rejected otherwise .",
    "the boundary deformation is represented by a symmetric strain tensor , whose trace ( i.e. , the sum of the diagonal components ) corresponds to the volume change ( i.e. , compression or expansion ) of the fundamental cell , and the off - diagonal components correspond to the shape change ( i.e. , deformation ) of the fundamental cell .",
    "the equilibrium pressure is obtained as discussed in the ensuing section .",
    "the equilibrium pressure of the truncated - tetrahedron system in our nvt simulation is computed from the distribution of interparticle gaps .",
    "following ref  , the scaled pressure @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number density of the system , @xmath30 is the temperature , and @xmath31 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 depends on the particle shape and is computed from the following relation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the probability that a given particle first overlaps with another particle if the packing fraction of the system is increased by @xmath35 , regardless of other overlapping pairs of particles .    in practice ,",
    "one just needs to compute for each particle the minimal compression ( i.e. , change of volume ) leading to overlap between it and its nearest neighbor .",
    "this process is repeated for every particle in the system and a histogram of the distribution of minimal interparticle gaps is then obtained .        to compute the free energy of the liquid phase",
    ", we first use pressure calculations discussed in section ii.b to obtain the associated dimensionless equation of state ( eos ) for the scaled pressure , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "then we integrate the eos from a low - density reference state with packing fraction @xmath37 to a specific @xmath5 to get the associated helmholtz free energy , @xcite i.e. , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and v is the volume of a particle , @xmath40 the chemical potential at packing fraction @xmath37 , which is calculated by the widom s particle insertion method .",

    "@xcite specifically , we construct a reversible path between the actual hard - particle crystal and an ideal einstein crystal , which allows us to calculate the free - energy difference between these two systems . since the free energy of the ideal einstein crystal is known analytically , we can thus obtain the absolute value of the free energy for the hard - particle crystal , i.e. , @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes ensemble average of systems with coupling potential @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the maximum coupling constant that is sufficiently strong to suppress particle collisions .",

    "in this section , we present a number of structural descriptors that quantitatively characterize various packing structures of truncated tetrahedra that are associated with the equilibrium and nonequilibrium phases of the system . in addition , we briefly review the `` hyperuniformity '' concept and its quantification , which appears to be a universal structural characteristic of general maximally random jammed packings .",

    "however , the magnitude of these oscillations are much smaller than that associated with mrj packings of hard spheres , or other polyhedra with small asphericity values ( e.g. , icosahedra ) .",
    "this is because in mrj sphere packings , the pair distances between contacting neighbors are exactly equal to the diameter of the spheres .",
    "however , for nonspherical particles , the pair distances between contacting neighbors in the associated mrj packings can vary from the diameter of their insphere to that of their circumsphere , and thus , causing large fluctuations of pair distances between the particle centroids . this further diminishes the magnitude of the oscillations in the associated @xmath153 , and thus the translational order in the system .",

    "we employ a linear polynomial to approximate the small-@xmath89 behavior of @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath156 , and use it to fit computed @xmath87 and find that @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "moreover , the slope is @xmath159 , which is significantly larger than @xmath160 .",

    "this also provide further evidence that the hyperuniform qlr correlations is a universal signature of mrj packings of hard convex particle of general shape .",
    "@xcite note that although we are employing a relatively small system with @xmath146 particles , based on previous research @xcite we expect that the extrapolated small-@xmath89 behavior of @xmath87 obtained from such systems should agree with extrapolations from large systems .",
    "therefore , our conclusions that mrj packings of truncated tetrahedra are hyperuniform , based on the relatively small systems that we have studied , should be firm .",
    "it is interesting to compare the slope @xmath162 of @xmath87 for small @xmath89 of truncated tetrahedra to those of other polyhedra that we have previously studied .",
    "for icosahedra , dodecahedra , octahedra and tetrahedra , the values of @xmath162 are respectively @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "it is apparent that as the polyhedral shape deviates more from that of a sphere , the value of the slope @xmath162 increases , i.e. , the degree of hyperuniformity decreases .",
    "this is because larger asphericities induce larger local number density fluctuations at fixed long wavelengths ( i.e. , small @xmath89 values ) due to the qlr correlations .",
    "we would like to note that for nonspherical particles , the more appropriate measure of hyperuniformity is based on local volume fraction fluctuations ( rather than density fluctuations ) and the small - wavenumber behavior of the associated spectrum density .",
    "@xcite similar conclusions on hyperuniform qlr correlations in the system will be obtained if the more general procedure is used , but with this procedure , the degree of hyperuniformity would decrease with decreasing packing fraction ( instead of with increasing asphericity ) .",
    "this is because denser packings possess more homogeneous void spaces , which lead to smaller local volume fraction fluctuations .",

    "specifically , when @xmath170 is close to unity , high - density disordered packings are entropically favored , i.e. , it is more difficult to produce the crystal phase and the associated maximally dense packing via simulation or experimental protocols .",

    "we found no evidence for any stable rotator or nematic phases .",
    "we also generated the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) packings of truncated tetrahedra , which may be regarded to be the ending state of a metastable branch of the phase diagram for truncated tetrahedra .",
    "specifically , we systematically studied the structural characteristics of the mrj packings , including the centroidal pair correlation function , structure factor and orientational pair correlation function .",
    "we found that such mrj packings are hyperuniform with an average packing fraction of @xmath186 , which is considerably larger than the corresponding value for identical spheres .",
    "we have also shown that the ratio @xmath187 for a general nonspherical particle shape provides a measure of its glass - forming ability .",
    "the transition from the ct to the densest - known crystal phase involves symmetry breaking as one would expect .",
    "specifically , the ct packing possess a higher degree of symmetry ( rhombohedral ) than that of the densest known packing ( triclinic ) .",
    "similar symmetry - breaking crystal - crystal phase transitions have also been observed in systems of truncated cubes with a small degree of truncation , @xcite which possess a first - order transition from the simple - cubic phase ( with cubic symmetry ) to the one associated with the densest - known packing ( with rhombohedral symmetry ) .",
    "we conjecture that particles with shapes close to the space - filling ones and that nearly fill all of space ( i.e. , those obtained by chopping of the corners of rhombohedron , cube , truncated octahedron , and certain prisms ) would probably undergo a first - order crystal - crystal transition from a high - symmetry solid phase to a low - symmetry one .",
    "the high - symmetry phase should be associated with the optimal configuration of the corresponding space - filling shape , and the low - symmetry phase should be associated with the densest - known packing of the actual particle that is nearly space - filling .",
    "@xcite since the low - symmetry phase should possess more free volume and thus is more favorable entropically compared to the high - symmetry phase , we expect that a solid - solid phase transition would occur at high densities in such systems . however , we emphasize that such qualitative predictions about the class of particle shapes that possess crystal - crystal phase transitions has yet to be identified and verified by rigorous free energy calculations",
    ".    these results also point to the great challenges in identifying solid - solid phase transitions in hard - particle systems .",
    "in particular , for truncated tetrahedra , if one had not known _ a prior _ about the existence of both crystal structures ( i.e. , the ct and densest known packings ) , @xcite one would never have tried to see if the phases associated with these distinct crystals could coexist .",
    "for example , if one only knew about the densest known packing but not the ct packing , and simply decompressed the packing from the highest density , one likely would have thought there was no other crystal phase .",
    "similarly , if one only knew about ct packing , then further compression of the ct from the melting point would probably not have alerted one to consider another crystal structure at very high densities .",
    "this also calls into the question whether in previous studies similar solid - sold phase transitions were missed for other particle shapes because no systematic structural probes were used to ascertain whether the crystal structure changed symmetry .",
    "we believe that crystal structures with distinct symmetries should be explicitly examined in order to correctly identify possible solid - solid phase transitions .",
    "it is also useful to compare the phase behavior of truncated tetrahedra to that of other nonspherical shapes , especially the nature of the disorder - order phase transition .",
    "truncated tetrahedra behave like regular octahedra @xcite in that both systems undergo a first - order transition from the isotropic liquid to a crystal phase .",
    "it is clear that this transition , which is entropy - driven , @xcite is determined by the characteristics of the particle shape .",
    "both the truncated tetrahedron and regular octahedron have an aspect ratio @xmath188 ( defined to be the ratio between the longest and shortest principal axis ) of unity .",
    "they also possess moderately sized values of a relative scaled exclusion volume @xmath189 , @xcite i.e. , @xmath190 and @xmath191 for truncated tetrahedra and octahedra , respectively . upon forming the crystal phase from the liquid , a sufficiently large increase of free - volume entropy is achieved by particle alignment and positional ordering , and",
    "thus , the crystal phase is favored . for shapes close to that of a sphere , such as ellipsoids with small @xmath188 and superballs with @xmath192 close to unity , the associated systems possess a transition from isotropic to rotator phase .",
    "this is because orientational ordering does not lead to significant increase of free - volume entropy , and thus , is not favored . on the other hand , as the aspect ratio of an ellipsoid increases beyond a critical value ( e.g. , @xmath193 ) , the systems start to form a nematic phase from liquid upon compression , @xcite due to a large gain of free - volume entropy by particle alignment .",
    "on the basis of the aforementioned observations and other previous research , @xcite we predict the phase that breaks the symmetry of the liquid for systems of hard non - spherical particles such as the regular icosahedra , dodecahedra , @xcite and rectangular parallelepiped ( with side lengths @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 , and @xmath197 ) . specifically , we expect that when the relative scaled exclusion volume @xmath192 for particles with flat faces is less than the order of @xmath198 , it is highly possible that rotator phase arises upon compression from isotropic liquid phase .",
    "the scaled exclusion volume of icosahedron is given by @xmath199 \\approx 8.915 $ ] , @xcite and the relative scaled exclusion volume is @xmath200 , which is very close to 1 .",
    "therefore , we expect the icosahedron systems to possess an isotropic - rotator phase transition . similarly , the scaled exclusion volume of dodecahedron is given by @xmath201 \\approx 9.121 $ ] and @xmath202 .",
    "@xcite we see again that the later value is close to 1 , which suggests that the dodecahedron system is likely to possess a rotator phase upon compression from isotropic liquid phase as well .",

    "again , when the value of @xmath192 is less than the order of @xmath198 , we expect that there exists a phase transition from the isotropic liquid to a rotator phase .",
