    "in a previous paper @xcite it has been shown that the bethe - salpeter(bs ) equation with an instantaneous interaction ( salpeter equation ) provides a suitable framework for relativistic quark models of light mesons .",
    "the use of the salpeter equation has several advantages compared to other treatments , i.e.    * the relativistic kinematics of the quarks is treated correctly ; * the amplitudes have the correct relativistic normalization ; * the lower component @xmath0 of the salpeter amplitude is determined dynamically .",
    "on the other hand the practical advantages of a nonrelativistic treatment are also present , i.e.    * the salpeter equation can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem @xmath1 for the mass @xmath2 of the bound state . * one can define a ( not positive definite ) scalar product @xmath3 for the salpeter amplitudes . *",
    "the salpeter operator @xmath4 is selfadjoint with respect to this scalar product .    in @xcite",
    "we have developed a numerical scheme which enables the calculation of meson mass spectra and the corresponding bs - amplitudes .",
    "furthermore we have given formulas to compute some important electroweak meson decay widths .",
    "in the present paper we shall apply this method to an explicit quark model for light mesons .",
    "our main concern in this context will be whether a realistic description of deeply bound states like the pion is compatible with a reasonable description of confinement .",
    "let us first give a list of the main features of light mesons that will be considered in the following :    * the low masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6 * the weak decay constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 * the decays @xmath9 * the masses and the flavor mixing coefficients of @xmath10 and @xmath11 * the masses and the leptonic decay widths for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons * the regge behavior @xmath14    as far as we know there presently is no model that can describe all these features in a consistent way .",
    "on the one hand there is the nonrelativistic quark model that gives a reasonable description of the mass spectra @xcite , but that completely fails in describing the decay widths of the deeply bound states like the pion ( see sec.[v1 ] ) . on the other hand",
    "there are models like the nambu jona - lasinio model @xcite that are based on the chiral symmetry of qcd for vanishing current quark masses .",
    "this model leads to a good description for the @xmath15 and @xmath11 mesons , but higher angular momenta states or radial excitations can not be described since confinement is ignored .",
    "an attempt to arrive at a more complete description based on the salpeter equation has recently been given by j.f.laga @xcite .",
    "his results show the difficulty of finding a suitable ansatz for the confining interaction kernel : he rejects the hypothesis of an instantaneous scalar confining kernel .",
    "the model we present in the following is based on a linear scalar or alternatively vector confining kernel combined with an effective interaction computed by t hooft from instanton effects in qcd @xcite .",
    "a nonrelativistic version of this interaction has already lead to good results for the meson and baryon mass spectra @xcite .",
    "we therefore feel encouraged to test this ansatz in the relativistic bethe - salpeter framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[ii ] we briefly summarize the main features of the salpeter equation as given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the explicit form of the confining bs - kernel and of the t hooft kernel is given in sec.[iii ] .",
    "in sec.[iv ] we present the calculated meson mass spectra and obtain the pion and kaon decay constants @xmath16 , the decay width into two photons for the @xmath17 and @xmath11 mesons and the leptonic widths for the vector mesons @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we will compare these decay widths to corresponding nonrelativistic results in sec.[v1 ] using the wave function of ref.@xcite , which shows the impressive improvement due to the relativistic treatment of the quarks compared to the nonrelativistic potential model .",
    "finally we give some concluding remarks in sec.[vi ] .",
    "for an instantaneous bs - kernel and free quark propagators the @xmath18 integrals in the bs - equation can be computed analytically in the rest frame of the bound state with mass @xmath2 .",
    "the result is known as the salpeter equation which reads @xmath19 \\ , \\gamma^0 \\ , \\lambda^+_2(-\\vec{p } ) } { m+\\omega_1+\\omega_2 }   \\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\int\\!\\ !",

    "one can now define a ( not positive definite ) scalar product for amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath30 the normalization condition for solutions of the salpeter equation is then given as @xmath31 .",
    "if one considers amplitudes satisfying @xmath32 one easily finds @xmath33 for most kernels of physical interests @xmath4 is selfadjoint with respect to the scalar product given above which implies that bound state masses @xmath2 are real for eigen functions @xmath34 with nonzero norm and that amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 corresponding to different eigenvalues @xmath37 are orthogonal , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "up to now the confining interaction of qcd is only known in the static limit of heavy quarks . in this limit",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the static potential between quarks is of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the relativistic corrections of the order @xmath41 . as stated by gromes @xcite it is still an open question whether an additional @xmath42 term should also be included into the static confining potential .",
    "usually one concludes from the sign of the spin - orbit coupling term in @xmath40 that the confining @xmath43-interaction behaves like a lorentz scalar .",
    "the problem for the case of light quarks is that up to now there is no unambiguous extension of the confining potential beyond the static limit .",
    "especially there is no prescription on how to extend it to a noninstantaneous form .",
    "naive noninstantaneous extensions fail as has been shown by s.n.biswas et al .",
    "@xcite for the harmonic oscillator bs - kernel @xmath44 that yields only a continuous spectrum .",
    "similar results are to be expected for other kernels like @xmath45 . because of these difficulties",
    "the only way we see at the moment is to parameterize confinement as an instantaneous interaction kernel .",
    "the sign of the ls - term in the static limit would be compatible with a scalar confinement kernel .",
    "however some authors @xcite have shown that the linear regge behavior @xmath14 is lost for this choice , since bound state masses come out too small for higher angular momenta .",
    "this is due to the relativistic corrections to the static potential and becomes more problematic with decreasing quark masses . for a vector confining kernel",
    "this problem almost disappears , but in the static limit a vector kernel leads to an ls - term which has the wrong sign . to our knowledge there presently is no convincing parameterization for the confining kernel that exhibits both features , i.e. leads to linear regge trajectories and yields a spin - orbit term with the correct sign .    in the following",
    "we will analyze both spin structures for the confinement , i.e. a scalar @xmath46 and a vector @xmath47 interaction .",
    "in the rest frame of the bound state the corresponding bs - kernels in eq.([bse ] ) are parameterized as @xmath48 & = & -{\\cal v}_c((\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}\\,')^2)\\,\\gamma^0\\,\\phi(\\vec{p}\\,')\\,\\gamma^0 \\label{vector } \\\\",

    "it is already known from nonrelativistic potential models that the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons @xmath51 can not be described with a confining potential alone .",
    "the usual extension would be to add another contribution to the interaction kernel that comes from a one gluon exchange ( oge ) .",
    "this works quite well for heavy quarkonia @xcite , but it is highly questionable for light mesons where perturbation theory can not be expected to work .",
    "since oge leads to a flavor independent interaction kernel one thus obtains degenerate @xmath5 and @xmath10 mesons in clear contradiction to the experimental mass values @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in order to cure this discrepancy",
    "one would have to take into account higher order diagrams .",
    "however there is another qcd based candidate for a residual @xmath43-interaction computed by t hooft and others from instanton effects @xcite which leads to good results for meson and baryon mass spectra within a nonrelativistic potential model @xcite .",
    "instantons are special solutions of the classical nonabelian yang - mills equations in euclidian space .",
    "they are peaked both in space and imaginary time having a finite extension @xmath54 .",
    "since they can not be deformed continuously into classical solutions corresponding to gluon fields they lead to an effective interaction between quarks that is not covered by perturbative gluon diagrams .",
    "this interaction leads to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry as can be seen by normal ordering of the underlying lagrangian ( see appendix [ thoapp ] ) .",
    "the normal ordered lagrangian takes the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an inessential constant that renormalizes the vacuum energy . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two and three body terms and @xmath59 is the effective constituent quark mass . in the following",
    "we will consider these terms .",
    "the contribution @xmath60 to the effective constituent quark mass @xmath59 is given by @xmath61 where the instanton density for three colors and three flavors reads @xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 within two loop accuracy @xcite . here",
    "@xmath64 is the qcd scale parameter .",
    "the integration over the instanton size @xmath54 has to be carried out up to a cutoff value @xmath65 where the @xmath66 term coming from the two loop correction is still small compared to the @xmath67 term",
    ".    equations ( [ gapeq ] ) are usually called gap equations .",
    "they describe the generation of a dynamical quark mass due to the interaction with the negative dirac see . in our model",
    "the constituent quark masses @xmath68 will be used as free parameters that are fitted to the experimental data .",
    "it will be checked in the end ( see sec.[v2 ] ) whether the obtained quark masses are compatible with common values for the quark condensates present in @xmath60 assuming that the confinement interaction does not contribute essentially to the process of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the two body term reads ( see appendix [ thoapp ] ) @xmath69        \\,(2{\\cal p}^c_{\\bar{3}}+{\\cal p}^c_6)\\ ,          q_m q_n : \\ ,        \\bigr\\ } \\label{dl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective coupling constants are given as @xmath70 and the tensor notation @xmath71 has been used for dirac and color indices .",
    "this representation explicitly shows the antisymmetric flavor dependence of the interaction .",
    "the color sextett and antitriplett projection matrices are given by @xmath72 so that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a color exchange matrix defined as @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the color matrices . just like the quark masses also the coupling constants will be treated as free parameters in our model .      after a lengthy calculation",

    "the effective three - body coupling constant is given by @xmath81 obviously this three body force does not contribute to @xmath43-states and to colorfree @xmath82-states .      in order to distinguish different indices in the following we will use the notation @xmath83 for dirac indices , @xmath84 for color indices and @xmath85 for flavor indices .",
    "the vertex corresponding to @xmath86 is shown in fig.[figthovertex ] .",
    "the vertex reads @xmath87 with the definition @xmath88 for the @xmath89 amplitude we have to consider the two diagrams given in fig.[figthoqqbar ] . in a meson",
    "the quark and the antiquark are in a color singulett state represented by the matrix @xmath90 .",
    "the color matrix elements for the two vertices are then given by @xmath91 so that only the second vertex in fig.[figthoqqbar ] contributes to the interaction kernel .",

    "the interaction leads to mixing of nonstrange and strange flavor amplitudes .",
    "the effective sign of the interaction is reversed for the scalar mesons thus being repulsive for the @xmath103 .",
    "note that in the nonrelativistic limit the t hooft interaction only acts on the pseudoscalar states @xmath104 .",
    "the t hooft kernel as it stands represents a pointlike interaction that has to be regularized .",
    "following ref.@xcite we do this by multiplying the kernel with a regularizing gaussian function @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in coordinate space",
    "this choice corresponds to replacing the @xmath108 function by @xmath109 which introduces a finite effective range @xmath110 .",
    "the main concern of our work was to see whether we can obtain a consistent description of a ) the masses and decays of the low lying pseudoscalar and vector mesons and b ) confinement reflected e.g. by the regge trajectories .    for this purpose",
    "we investigate two different models of the confinement kernel : 1 ) a vector @xmath111- and 2 ) a scalar @xmath112-structure .",
    "the parameters used are the nonstrange and strange quark masses @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the offset @xmath115 and slope @xmath116 of the confinement interaction , the two coupling constants g , g and the effective range @xmath110 of the residual instanton induced interaction .",
    "so the total number of parameters amounts to seven .",
    "we used two sets of parameters in the vector confinement case : model v1 was tuned to reproduce the masses and decays of the low lying mesons .",
    "we therefore used a small nonstrange quark mass @xmath113 , as the correct description of the pseudoscalar decays depends essentially on this quantity .",
    "given this mass we had to take a moderate confinement slope to reproduce the decays of the vectormesons .",
    "the offset @xmath115 was fixed by the @xmath54-mass and @xmath114 by the @xmath117-mass .",
    "finally g and g were fixed by the masses of the pseudoscalars @xmath118 and k. in model v2 we used a larger nonstrange mass of @xmath113 of about 1/3 of the nucleon mass , which is a value common to nonrelativistic quark models .",
    "the aim of this parameter set was to obtain a good description of the regge trajectories and the higher lying resonances .",
    "finally in model s we investigated a scalar confinement provided with the same quark mass @xmath113 as in v2 .",
    "for this kernel it turned out that our method of solving this type of bs equation works reasonably for higher angular momenta only if the fraction of the confinement slope @xmath116 and the quark mass @xmath119 is sufficiently small .",
    "the parameters for the three model are listed in tab.[param ] .",
    "the quality of the mass spectra is different for the three models , as different priorities led us to the parameters .",
    "common to all three models is an overall agreement of the masses of the pseudoscalars @xmath120 and the vector mesons @xmath121 .",
    "the spectra for these meson are compared to experiment in figs .",
    "[ spectra1],[spectra2 ] .",
    "the t hooft interaction leads to the correct splitting of @xmath122 and @xmath11 mass .",
    "in contrast with experiment , where the @xmath123 and @xmath124 are nearly degenerate , we obtain a large splitting due to the instanton induced interaction of several hundred mev ( compare tab.[spor ] ) . for a vector type kernel with positive spin orbit splitting",
    "this leads an enormous attraction : although there is a scalar state at roughly 1gev , we also find a state with imaginary mass and zero norm .",
    "the physical interpretation of this phenomenon however is not clear . for a scalar confinement",
    "this effect is compensated by the negative spin orbit splitting . in the following",
    "we will discuss the differences of the three parameter sets .    since in model v1 we used a small confinement slope to reproduce the decays of the vectormesons , the calculated regge trajectory is too flat ( see fig.[regge ] ) .",
    "the spin orbit splitting between the @xmath125 and @xmath126 mesons in our model is purely due to the confining interaction . in both models with vector kernel",
    "it is of order of 200 mev exceeding the experimental mass difference , which is in fact rather small ( see tab.[spor ] ) .    in model v2 with large quark masses and large confinement slope",
    "@xmath116 we obtain a good description of the masses of all mesons comparable to the results in nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "however @xmath116 has to be much larger in the bs framework , as obviously the kinetic energy is overestimated in nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "the regge trajectories representing the confinement property are well reproduced ( fig.[regge ] ) . for the spin orbit splitting the same remarks as for v1 apply .",
    "finally model s shows a reasonable description of the ground states of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons . for the states with large angular momentum",
    "the method of solving the bs equation by a basis expansion does not lead to convergent solutions with positive norm .",
    "with increasing dimension of the basis the smallest positive eigenvalue decreases until it becomes imaginary ( a similar problem arises if one studies a @xmath127 interaction ) .",
    "we therefore can not explicitly exclude a scalar confining potential , mainly because with the present parameters we were not able to find stationary solutions for higher angular momenta .",
    "for these reasons we also omitted in the regge plot the state with angular momentum j=4 . the @xmath128 meson mass is larger than the mass of the @xmath129 meson . taken together with the results for the vector case this indicates that the spin orbit splitting can only be explained by a mixture of scalar and vector type interaction .      in this section",
    "we will discuss the influence of the parameters on the decay observables of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "the parameters of model v1 have been chosen in order to give a good description of the masses and the decays of the pseudoscalar and vector ground states . as can be seen in tab.[decays ] ,",
    "we obtain an almost quantitative agreement . as an important result we consider the fact that the @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which usually are interpreted as goldstone particles of the of chiral symmetry breaking , also may be understood as bound states of quark and antiquark , albeit with relatively small quark masses .",
    "this is reflected in the simultaneous agreement we obtain for the pion decay constant @xmath7 and the decay width @xmath132 , which in the alternative goldstone picture are related to the adler bell jackiv anomaly @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear that a relativistic treatment of the decay formula and of the normalization are important for a correct understanding of the pion as deeply bound quark antiquark state .",
    "this can also be seen in fig.[wf1 ] showing the upper and lower component @xmath133 of the pion amplitude .",
    "in contrast to the wave function for the @xmath54 meson ( fig.[wf2 ] ) the upper pion amplitude is only about 10% larger than the lower one in the region of small relative momenta . for higher momenta",
    "the amplitudes even become equal .",
    "this fact obviously leads to important cancellations for the normalization and for the decay constant .",
    "this was already emphasized in an early quark model @xcite , where the effects of different estimates for the relation between the upper and lower component on weak decay constants for pion and kaon were analyzed . for a comparison with nonrelativistic decay formulas",
    "compare sec.[v1 ] .",
    "although the pion amplitude has significant contributions up to momenta of about 4gev / c , the main part e.g. of the integral for the @xmath134 decay width comes from momenta of about 150 mev / c ( as this is the scale of nonstrange and pion mass ) .    for the @xmath135 decay we also find excellent agreement with experiment , whereas the process for the @xmath136 is underestimated .",
    "the results depend strongly on the correct @xmath137- @xmath138 mixing , as e.g. for the @xmath10 we obtain a negative interference .",
    "the mixing ( due to the instanton induced interaction ) can be compared to a simple model given by rosner @xcite .",
    "the physical mesons are expanded in a basis of three states @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 : @xmath142 the coefficients may be estimated from electromagnetic transitions @xcite .",
    "we compared the results for the absolute values of x and y in tab.[mix ] with the contributions of the nonstrange and strange part of the amplitude to the relativistic norm .",
    "the results agree well in the case of the @xmath10 , but not for the @xmath143 .",
    "experimental results indicate a larger gluonic component for the @xmath143 , which could modify the results .",
    "the leptonic decay widths for the vector mesons are also in good agreement with the data .",
    "this is essentially due to the small confinement slope , which determines the size of these mesons .",
    "we conclude that a consistent description of all the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons is possible in this framework .",
    "however , more observables like electromagnetic transitions or the pion form factor will be calculated in the future to substantiate this statement .",
    "the agreement with experimental data for model v2 , which was designed to reproduce the higher resonances and regge trajectories , is only of a qualitative character ( tab.[decays ] ) .",
    "decay constants and photon decay widths disagree by about 50% , which is essentially due to the large quark mass .",
    "the leptonic decay widths of the vector mesons are overestimated due to the steep confinement , which enlarges the amplitudes at the origin in coordinate space .",
    "comparing the two parameter sets for vector confinement we find : v1 with light quark masses gives a quantitative description for the vector and pseudoscalar ground states , but only a qualitative picture of the regge behavior .",
    "for v2 with large quark masses the situation is opposite .",
    "this might be an indication that for large distances the mass of the quarks effectively should increase due to some additional mass of a string .",
    "for model s we find good agreement for the vector mesons , but not as good for the pseudoscalars .",
    "although it is possible to describe the latter with a smaller quark mass , we could not obtain a quantitative adjustment for both @xmath144 and @xmath145 with a scalar confining kernel .      in order to estimate the relevance of relativistic effects in our model it is useful to compare the results with the corresponding ones computed in the nonrelativistic quark model . in the nonrelativistic limit the salpeter equation reduces to the usual schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian given by @xmath146 where the @xmath147-function again has to be regularized according to eq.([regtho ] ) .",
    "the mass spectra for this hamiltonian have already been investigated in an earlier work @xcite being in good agreement with experiment . in the following",
    "we will use the wave functions @xmath148 of @xcite to calculate the decay observables using the well known formulas @xcite @xmath149 here @xmath2 is the experimental meson mass , @xmath119 is the quark mass , @xmath150 and @xmath151 gives the quark charge in units of the proton charge according to the flavor composition of the meson .",
    "the results for these decays are given in tab.[decays ] .",
    "one finds that leptonic decays can already be described reasonably in a nonrelativistic framework . on the other hand the weak decay constants and especially the two photon decay widths are far away from the experimental data .",
    "this discrepancy can not be cured by changing the parameters within reasonable limits .",
    "we therefore conclude that a relativistic treatment is essential for the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "due to the process of chiral symmetry breaking the t hooft interaction leads to relations for the effective constituent quark masses @xmath152 and the coupling constants @xmath153 as given in eqs.([gapeq ] ) . in order to check if these relations are qualitatively compatible with the fitted parameter sets we use @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( compare @xcite ) and plot @xmath159 and @xmath102 as functions of the instanton size cutoff @xmath65 as shown in figs.[gapplot1],[gapplot2 ] .    because of the delicate dependence on the condensate values and due to the regularization procedure in the t hooft kernel one should not expect quantitative agreement with the fitted parameter sets .    for @xmath160 one",
    "finds e.g. @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 . despite of the strange quark mass which comes out too small",
    "the other parameters are quite close to the values of parameter set v1 .",
    "note that @xmath65 is almost equal to the effective range @xmath110 of the t hooft interaction .",
    "furthermore we find that @xmath102 is smaller than @xmath101 for all values of @xmath65 as is the case for all three parameter sets .",
    "within the framework of the instantaneous bethe salpeter equation we investigated different models for mesons as bound states of quark and antiquark .",
    "we consider it to be the main result of this work that the masses , weak decay constants and two photon widths of the light pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath165 ) can be understood quantitatively in terms of a @xmath43 description , alternatively to the goldstone picture . with the same parameters also",
    "the masses and leptonic decays of the vector mesons can be reproduced .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons are dominantly affected by an instanton induced interaction , which apart from the @xmath122 splitting gives the correct @xmath166mixing for the @xmath10 meson .",
    "the self energy corrections and coupling constants due to the resulting chiral symmetry breaking are compatible with the parameters we used for the quark antiquark interaction .",
    "in contrast to nonrelativistic calculations instanton effects appear also in the scalar sector and lead to a isoscalar state with imaginary mass and zero norm .    concerning the nature of the confinement kernel we find that a vector type interaction can reproduce the regge trajectories , although with a larger quark mass than the one needed to describe the lowest lying mesons .",
    "this might be an indication that due to string effects the quark mass should increase with distance .",
    "we were only able to find reliable solutions with a scalar kernel for relatively large quark masses and weak confinement . with these parameters , however , one can not reproduce quantitatively the ground state mesons or the regge trajectories .",
