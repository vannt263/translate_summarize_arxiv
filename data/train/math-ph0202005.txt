    "\\begin{defi } a lorentzian manifold $ v$ is said to be distinguishing if for every neighbourhood $ u_p$ of $ p\\in v$ there exist another neighbourhood $ b_p\\subset u_p$ containing $ p$ which intersects every causal curve meeting $ p$ in a connected set .",
    "\\label{distinguishing } \\end{defi }    we need some concepts of standard causality theory . for",
    "any $ p\\in v$ one can introduce normal coordinates in a neighbourhood $ { \\cal n}_p$ of $ p$ ( see , e.g. \\cite{cond } ) . then the exponential map provides a diffeomorphism $ \\exp:{\\cal o}\\subset t_p(v)\\rightarrow   { \\cal n}_p$ where $ { \\cal o}$ is an open neighbourhood of $ \\vec{0}\\in t_p(v)$. the interior of the future ( past ) light cone of $ p$ is defined by $ c^{\\pm}_p=\\exp(\\mbox{int}(\\z^{\\pm}(p))\\cap { \\cal o})$ , and obviously $ c^{\\pm}_p\\subseteq i^{\\pm}(p)$ \\cite{cond}. other important issue deals with the chronology relation $ < \\!\\!<$ between two points .",
    "we have $ p<\\!\\!<q$ if there exist a future timelike curve joining $ p$ and $ q$. see \\cite{kronheimer } for an axiomatic study of this relation .",

    "let $ q\\in\\g$ be an arbitrary point of the curve .",
    "if we take a normal neighbourhood of $ q$ , $ { \\cal n}_q$ then we can find a neighbourhood $ u_q$ of $ q$ which is intersected in a connected set by every causal curve meeting $ q$. now , if we pick up a point $ z\\in\\g\\cap u_q$ we have that either $ q<\\!\\!<z$ or $ z<\\!\\!<q$. assuming the former we deduce that there exists a timelike curve $ \\tilde{\\g}$ joining $ q$ and $ z$ which implies that $ \\tilde{\\g}\\cap u_q$ is a connected set . this property",
    "together with the distinguishability of $ v$ implies that $ \\tilde{\\g}$ must be a subset of $ u_q$ and hence $ \\tilde{\\g}\\subset { \\cal n}_q$ from what we conclude that $ \\tilde{\\g}\\subset c_p$ ( \\cite{cond } ) and hence $ z\\in c_p$ $ \\forall",
    "z\\in\\g\\cap u_q$ which is only possible if $ \\g\\cap u_q$ is timelike . by covering $ \\g$ with sets of the form $ \\g\\cap u_q$ , $",

    "if $ \\k$ is   a null vector , $ \\f^{'}\\k$ must be a causal vector ( to see it just   construct a sequence of timelike future directed vectors converging   to $ \\k$ ) which proves that $ \\f$ is a proper causal relation.\\n    the results for the cauchy developments are the following : \\begin{prop } if $ v\\prec_{\\f } w$ then   $ d^{\\pm}(\\f(\\zeta))\\subseteq \\f(d^{\\pm}(\\zeta ) ) , \\,\\ , \\forall \\zeta\\subseteq v$. \\label{cauch } \\end{prop } \\p it is enough to prove the future case .",

    "for instance , from the previous   corollary we deduce that $ v\\prec w$ is impossible if $ w$ is   globally hyperbolic but $ v$ is not .",
    "other impossibilities arise as   follows .",
    "let us recall that , for any inextendible causal curve $ \\g$ ,   the   boundaries $ \\partial i^{\\pm}(\\g)$ of its chronological future and   past   are usually called its future and past event horizons , sometimes also   called particle horizons \\cite{ff , w , cond}. of course these sets can   be empty ( then one says that $ \\g$ has no horizon ) .",

    "this algebraic structure is well - known , see e.g. \\cite{semigroup } ,   and called subsemigroup with identity or submonoid .",
    "thus , $ \\c(v)$ is a { \\em submonoid } of the group of diffeomorphisms of   $ v$. nonetheless , $ \\c(v)$ usually fails to be a group .",

    "notice , however , that if $ \\{\\f_{s}\\}_{s\\in \\r}$ is a one - parameter   group of causal transformations , from the previous results the only possibility is that $ \\{\\f_{s}\\}$ be in fact a group of conformal motions . on the   other hand ,",
    "things are more subtle if there are no conformal   transformations in the family $ \\{\\f_s\\}$ other than the identity , in   which case it is easy to see that the ` best ' one can accomplish is   that either $ g^{+}\\equiv \\{\\f_{s}\\}_{s\\in \\r^{+}}$ or $ g^{-}\\equiv \\{\\f_{s}\\}_{s\\in \\r^{-}}$ is in $ \\c(v)$. if this   happens one talks about maximal one - parameter submonoids of proper causal transformations .",
    "of course , it is also possible to define local one - parameter submonoids of   causal transformations $ \\{\\f_s\\}_{s\\in i}$ for some interval   $ i=(-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$ of the real line assuming that $ \\{\\f_s\\}_{s\\in ( 0,\\epsilon)}$ consists of proper   causal transformations . in any of these cases",

    "let us take $ v$ as the einstein static universe \\cite{ff } and $ w=\\ss$   as   de sitter spacetime . in both cases",
    "the manifold is $ \\r\\times   s^{3}$ and hence they are diffeomorphic . by proposition \\ref{hor } we   know that $ v\\not\\prec w$ because every causal curve in de sitter   spacetime possesses event horizons .",
    "however , the proper causal   relation in the opposite way does hold as can be shown by   constructing it explicitly .",
    "the line element of each spacetime is   ( with the notation $ d\\o^2=d\\z^2+\\sin^2\\z d\\phi^2 $ ) : \\bea v : & & ds^{2}=dt^{2}-a^2(d\\x^{2}+\\sin^{2}\\x d\\o^{2})\\ \\nonumber\\\\ w : & &   d\\tilde{s}^{2}=d\\bar{t}^{2}-\\alpha^{2}\\cosh^{2}(\\bar{t}/\\alpha ) ( d\\bar{\\x}^{2}+\\sin^{2}\\bar{\\x }   d\\bar{\\o}^{2})\\ \\nonumber \\eea where $ \\x,\\z,\\phi$ ( and their barred versions ) are standard   coordinates in $ s^{3}$ and $ a,\\alpha$ are constants .",

    "we have introduced the concepts of causal relation and causal isomorphism of lorentzian manifolds which allow us to establish rigorously when two given lorentzian manifolds are causally indistinguishable regardless their metric properties .",
