    "in the conventional hydrodynamic models for analyses of relativistic heavy - ion collisions , both chemical and thermal equilibrium are assumed and the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath5 is the same as the thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath6 which is so chosen as to reproduce the slope of @xmath0 ( or @xmath7 ) spectra . for analyses of the @xmath0 slope at the rhic energy by using the conventional hydrodynamics ,",

    "various analyses based on thermal models indicate the following picture of time evolution of hot and dense hadronic matter @xcite : the system first undergoes the chemical freeze - out at @xmath5 where the observed particle ratios are fixed , continues to cool down and finally goes through the thermal freeze - out where the momentum distribution is fixed .",
    "we take account of this picture in a hydrodynamic model and discuss how the early chemical freeze - out affects the space - time evolution of fluids .",
    "we also analyse the particle spectrum at the rhic energy . in the present work ,",
    "we assume @xmath8 for simplicity .",
    "although we neglect finite baryon effects , our hydrodynamic simulations are performed _ in a genuine three dimensional space_. as a future work , we will include finite @xmath9 in our model and analyse particle ratios and spectra at various collision energies @xcite .",
    "we construct three models equation of state ( eos ) to discuss the space - time evolution of fluids .",
    "these models describe the first order phase transition between the qgp phase and the hadron phase at @xmath10 mev .",
    "we suppose the qgp phase is composed of massless u , d , s quarks and gluons and that it is common to three models . for the hadron phase ,",
    "we choose three different models eos as follows .",
    "the first model is a conventional resonance gas model in which complete chemical equilibrium is always assumed ( model ce ) .",
    "we include hadrons up to the mass of @xmath11 for simplicity .",
    "the second model is the simplest one which describes the picture of chemical freeze - out ( model cfo ) .",
    "below @xmath5 , we assume the numbers of _ all _ hadrons @xmath12 included in the eos are fixed and that the particle number densities obey @xmath13 .",
    "we introduce a chemical potential @xmath14 associated with each species so that @xmath12 becomes a conserved quantity . from the conservation of entropy @xmath15",
    ", the ratio of the particle number density to the entropy density obeys @xmath16 for all hadrons along the adiabatic path .",
    "here we assume @xmath17 mev , which is consistent with a recent analysis based on a thermal model @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ ratio1 ] ) , we obtain a chemical potential as a function of temperature for each hadron .",
    "+   fig .  1 : ( left ) pressure as functions of energy density for three models ( right ) temperature as functions of energy density .",
    "the third model represents a more realistic eos than the second one .",
    "the observed particle numbers are always composed of the direct particles and the contribution from resonance decays , e.g. , @xmath18 .",
    "so some processes with large cross sections can be equilibrated even below @xmath5 as long as the equality @xmath19 is kept instead of eq .",
    "( [ ratio1 ] ) .",
    "we assume @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are  stable \" particles and that all chemical potentials can be represented by chemical potentials associated with these stable particles , e.g. , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and so on @xcite .",
    "thus the third model describes the _ partial _ chemical equilibrium ( model pce ) even below @xmath5 .",
    "one can easily evaluate eos s for these models by using chemical potentials as obtained above .",
    "we represent pressure and temperature as functions of energy density for three models in fig .  1 .",
    "we find pressure as a function of energy density is similar to each other .",
    "on the other hand , temperature as a function of energy density in the models cfo or pce is deviated from the model ce .",
    "see also fig .  1 ( right ) .",
    "since the resonance population of the models cfo or pce is larger than that of the model ce due to the chemical freeze - out , the energy density at a fixed temperature in the hadron phase is also large in those models .",
    "conversely , temperature in the models cfo or pce at a fixed energy density is _ smaller _ than in the model ce .",
    "by using the eos s in the previous section , we perform the hydrodynamic simulation with appropriate initial conditions and compare the hydrodynamic evolution with each other .",
    "we choose initial conditions so as to roughly reproduce pseudorapidity distribution in au+au 130@xmath29 gev central ( 0 - 6 % ) and semi - central ( 35 - 45 % ) collisions obtained by the phobos collaboration @xcite . at the initial time",

    ", we expect the time evolution of _ energy density _ is similar to each other . however , when we transpose the energy density to the temperature by using eos s in fig .  1 ( right )",
    ", the difference between three models appears in the time evolution of _",
    "temperature_. we find temperature in the models cfo or pce cools down more rapidly than in the conventional model ce .",
    "we next show in fig .  2 ( right ) the thermal freeze - out temperature dependence of average radial flow at vanishing space - time rapidity @xmath33 and",
    "compare our results with the ones from thermal models .",
    "radial flows in the models cfo and pce are considerably reduced .",
    "this is understood qualitatively by the same reason as the above discussion on the time evolution of temperature .",
    "these results seem to be consistent with the one obtained by burward - hoy @xcite , while these are completely inconsistent with the model i@xmath34i in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the results from thermal models are different from each other and we do not take into account the baryonic chemical potential , more detailed analyses based on both thermal and hydrodynamical models are needed to understand the _ thermal _ freeze - out .",

    "experimental data is observed by the star collaboration @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath0 slope usually depends on @xmath6 in the conventional eos where the chemical equilibrium is assumed , our result for the model pce is found to be almost independent of @xmath35 due to the reduction of radial flow .",
    "figure 3 ( right ) shows the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath36 for charged hadrons in minimum bias events .",

    "we consistently reproduce experimental data of both @xmath0 spectrum and @xmath1 below 1 gev/@xmath31 by choosing @xmath2 mev , so contribution from hard processes can become dominated above 1 gev/@xmath31 . note that the concavity of @xmath1 in small @xmath0 region ( @xmath38 gev/@xmath31 ) is due to the resonance decay after thermal freeze - out @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the effect of early chemical freeze - out on radial and elliptic flow at the rhic energy .",
    "we found the system cools down more rapidly than the conventional model due to the large population of resonances .",
    "we also found that the resultant radial flow is considerably reduced when we compare with each other at a fixed @xmath6 .",
    "although the space - time evolution of temperature in the model pce is considerably different from the conventional model , we consistently reproduced @xmath0 spectrum and @xmath1 below 1 gev/@xmath31 by choosing the thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath2 mev .",
    "this indicates the contribution from hard processes can become dominated above 1 gev/@xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that the average radial flow results in @xmath39 .    since the two pion correlation function",
    "is believed to be sensitive to the size and the lifetime of the fluid , it is interesting to see the effect of early chemical freeze - out on the hbt radii .",
