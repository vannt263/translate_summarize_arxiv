    "the algebra @xmath21 is a twisted @xmath22-algebra .",

    "the algebras @xmath41 and @xmath38 are not associative , moreover , they are not alternative .",

    "theorem [ simprop ] answers the question for which @xmath6 ( and @xmath64 ) the constructed algebras are simple .",
    "the result is quite similar to that for the clifford algebras , except that the algebras @xmath41 and @xmath38 degenerate for one value of @xmath6 over 4 and not 1 over 2 as  @xmath27 .",
    "4 .   theorem [ solcx ] provides explicit formul of the hurwitz - radon square identities .",
    "the algebras @xmath41 ( as well as @xmath38 ) are not composition algebras .",

    "similarly , one has to determine which one of the triples @xmath643 anti - associate to determine the cubic terms in @xmath629 .",
    "this yields to the expression    the explicit formula for the factor set @xmath14 in coordinates on @xmath620 is immediately obtained by ( [ fakset ] ) .",
    "note that the signature in this case is @xmath644 , so that we have to add @xmath645 to  ( [ fakset ] ) .",
    "the difference between the loops generated by the basis elements of @xmath41 and @xmath38 and the parker loop is that the function is not @xmath241-invariant .",
    "our classification results can not be applied in this case .",
    "we hope that the notion of generating function can be a useful tool for study of code loops .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to relate the algebraic problems we study to the general framework of linear algebra over @xmath73 which is a classical domain .",
    "all the algebraic structures on @xmath0 we consider are invariant with respect to the action of the group automorphisms @xmath646 for instance , the generating function @xmath224 , as well as @xmath89 and @xmath60 , are considered up to the @xmath647-equivalence ( called `` congruence '' in the classic literature @xcite ) .",
    "there are exactly two non - equivalent non - degenerate quadratic forms on @xmath648 with coefficients in @xmath73 ( see @xcite for the details ) : @xmath649 where @xmath650 or @xmath8 .",
    "note that sometimes the case @xmath651 is not considered ( see @xcite , p.xix ) since the extra term is actually linear , for @xmath652 .",
    "the corresponding polar bilinear form @xmath277 and the trilinear form @xmath278 do not depend on @xmath653 .",
    "the corresponding twisted group algebra is isomorphic to the clifford algebra @xmath27 .",
    "the normal form ( [ darboux ] ) is written in the standard darboux basis , this formula has several algebraic corollaries .",
    "for instance , we immediately obtain the well - known factorization of the complex clifford algebras : @xmath654,\\ ] ] where @xmath655 $ ] are @xmath656-matrices .",
    "indeed , the function ( [ darboux ] ) , with @xmath650 , is nothing but the sum of @xmath657 generating functions of @xmath658 . the other classical symmetry and periodicity theorems for the clifford algebras can also be deduced in this way .        in this paper , we were led to consider polynomials @xmath224 of degree  3 : @xmath659 where @xmath660 and @xmath661 are arbitrary coefficients ( equal to 1 or 0 ) .",
    "it turns out that it is far of being obvious to understand what means @xmath150 is `` non - degenerate '' .    to every polynomial @xmath150",
    ", we associate a binary function @xmath277 and a trilinear form @xmath278 , see formula ( [ genalp2 ] ) , which is of course just the polarization ( or linearization ) of  @xmath150 .",
    "the form @xmath60 is alternate : @xmath662 and depends only on the homogeneous part of degree 3 of @xmath150 , i.e. , only on @xmath660 .",
    "there are three different ways to understand the notion of non - degeneracy .",
    "\\(1 ) the most naive way : @xmath150 ( and @xmath60 ) is non - degenerate if for all linearly independent @xmath228 , the linear function @xmath663 .",
    "one can show that , with this definition , _ there are no non - degenerate cubic forms on @xmath664 for @xmath232 .",
    "_ this is of course not the way we take .",
    "\\(2 ) the second way to understand non - degeneracy is as follows .",
    "the trilinear map @xmath60 itself defines an @xmath6-dimensional algebra .",
    "indeed , identifying @xmath0 with its dual space , the trilinear function @xmath60 defines a product @xmath665 .",
    "one can say that @xmath60 ( and @xmath150 ) is non - degenerate if this algebra is simple .",
    "this second way is much more interesting and is related to many different subjects .",
    "for instance , classification of simple lie ( super)algebras over @xmath73 is still an open problem , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this definition also depends only on the homogeneous part of degree 3 of @xmath150 .",
    "\\(3 ) we understand non - degeneracy yet in a different way .",
    "we say that @xmath150 is non - degenerate if for all linearly independent @xmath666 there exists @xmath486 such that @xmath667 where @xmath277 .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that the algebra with the generated function  @xmath150 is simple , cf .",
    "section  [ proosimprop ] .",
    "we believe that every non - degenerate ( in the above sense ) polynomial of degree 3 on  @xmath664 is equivalent to one of the two forms ( [ nashalp ] ) and ( [ nashalpbis ] ) .",
    "note that a positive answer would imply the uniqueness results of section [ uniqresec ] without the @xmath241-invariance assumption .        throughout this work , we encountered and extensively used the linear operators @xmath668 , for @xmath669 , cf .",
    "( [ genalp2 ] ) and  ( [ deltrequat ] ) , that associate a @xmath442-cochain on @xmath0 to a function .",
    "these operators were defined in @xcite , and used in the moufang loops theory , @xcite .",
    "operations of this type are called _ natural _ or _ invariant _ since they commute with the action of @xmath647 .",
    "the operator @xmath668 fits to the usual understanding of `` higher derivation '' since the condition @xmath670 is equivalent to the fact that @xmath150 is a polynomial of degree @xmath671 .",
    "the cohomological meaning of @xmath668 is as follows . in the case of an abelian group @xmath81",
    ", the cochain complex with coefficients in @xmath73 has a richer structure .",
    "there exist @xmath442 natural operators acting from @xmath672 to @xmath673 :    where @xmath674 is a `` partial differential '' , i.e. , the differential with respect to one variable .",
    "for instance , if @xmath675 is a function in two variables , then @xmath676 in this formula @xmath486 is understood as a parameter and one can write @xmath677 , where @xmath678 . at each order",
    "one has @xmath679    if @xmath680 , then an _ arbitrary _ sequence of the partial derivatives gives the same result : @xmath681 , for example one has @xmath682 etc .",
