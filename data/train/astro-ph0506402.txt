    "the formation of massive stars is not a well understood process neither observationally nor physically .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that they form deeply embedded in the cores of molecular clouds , where they are optically obscured by circumstellar dust .",
    "additionally , massive stars form on relatively short timescales , they tend to form only in clustered mode , and occur at distances greater than the nearest examples of their low mass counterparts .",
    "consequently , the combination of these factors hinders the study of regions undergoing massive star formation , specifically the earliest processes involved in their evolution , of which there are few clear examples .",
    "theoretical models suggest that high mass star formation could proceed either through protostellar mergers ( @xcite ) or through the collapse of a supersonically turbulent core ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first scenario requires dense clusters ( @xmath12 stars pc@xmath13 ) , that will trigger coalescence , whilst the second requires high accretion rates ( @xmath14 @xmath1   yr@xmath15 ) that will overcome the outward radiative pressure .    to date our knowledge of the earliest stages of high - mass star formation",

    "methanol masers have proven particularly useful as tracers of massive star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the coincidence of methanol masers and/or ultra compact hii   regions ( uc hii ) with massive star formation suggests that the two ( tracers and massive stars ) are inextricably linked .",
    "consequently , maser and radio continuum emission can be used as a means of tracing regions of massive star formation ( msf ) .",
    "high angular resolution ( @xmath27 - @xmath28 ) observations ( @xcite ) have shown that methanol masers are generally _ not _ directly associated with the uc hii   regions , but rather tend to be separated from them and possibly associated with hot molecular cores ( hmcs ) .",

    ", the size of the uc hii   region is generally smaller when there are masers present , suggesting such regions are possibly younger .",
    "this discovery , together with the fact that @xmath30 of the masers were not associated with uc hii   regions , led walsh and his colleagues to propose an evolutionary sequence for massive star formation .",
    "they proposed that the methanol masers exist prior to the onset and development of the uc hii   region , the maser emission is then destroyed by an ionising region surrounding the stars , and the uc hii   region evolves following the destruction of the maser .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that methanol masers are associated with sub - millimetre continuum emission , and hence trace cold , deeply embedded objects .    an alternative hypothesis to explain the low correlation between uc hii   regions and methanol masers is proposed by @xcite .",
    "they suggest instead , that maser emission can arise from intermediate mass non - ionising stars , which yield sufficient ir photons to pump the masing transition , but insufficient uv photons to produce an uc hii   region .    in this paper",

    "conversely to this , it is not possible to conclusively state that the remaining 70% of sources _ do _ have mid - ir emission due to an excess in emission and confusion in many of the infrared images examined .    the histograms ( fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) and cumulative distributions ( fig .",
    "[ cumul ] ) show that the mm - only cores are smaller in radius and are also less massive ( 0.4  pc and 0.9  @xmath3@xmath1   on average ) than those cores harbouring a methanol maser and/or an uc hii   region ( 0.7  pc and 2.5  @xmath3@xmath1   on average ) .",
    "analysis of the sources with no distance ambiguity confirms the robustness of this result , and the small influence of assuming the near distance for those sources with a distance ambiguity .",
    "the mm - only cores display no evidence of ongoing massive star formation : they are not associated with any compact radio emission signifying the presence of uc hii   regions , nor do they display evidence of h@xmath4o or ch@xmath49oh maser emission .",
    "at least 45% of these mm - only cores do not display any mid infrared emission , as detected by the _ msx _   satellite .",
    "these results lead to two hypotheses about the nature of the mm - only cores .",
    "it is possible that they are a precursor to the methanol maser , hence younger , less massive and smaller .",
    "accordingly , these mm - only cores may represent an earlier evolutionary stage to that of cores associated with methanol masers and/or uc hii   regions .",
    "that is , they may in fact represent the earliest stage in the formation of massive stars , prior to the onset of methanol maser emission .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the mm - only cores are simply intermediate mass cores that will give birth to intermediate mass stars ( hypothesis 2 ) . undermining this hypothesis however ,",
    "is the fact that even the least massive mm - only cores have masses which will support stars in excess of 10  @xmath1   forming .",
    "however , if this hypothesis is true , it suggests that the maximum mass of a star in a cluster is related to the mass of the molecular core from which it is formed .",
    "the mm - only cores may in fact provide examples to support both hypotheses .",
    "that is , the smaller , less massive mm - only cores may contain intermediate mass stars in the process of formation , while the larger more massive mm - only cores represent an earlier evolutionary state of massive star formation prior to the onset of methanol maser emission .",
    "assuming the same temperature ( 20  k ) for all of the cores in the sample introduces an element of uncertainty in the final mass estimates derived .",
    "if , for example , we have underestimated the temperature of the radio continuum sources , which typically have temperatures of the order 40  k ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , then we have overestimated the mass of the cores by a factor of 2.3 ( see table [ scalef ] ) .",
    "in this instance the mass ranges of each of the classes of source ( mm , m , mr and r ) would be comparable .",
    "if this were so , then the mm - only cores are colder cores , which are as massive as the methanol maser cores .",
    "the mm - only cores are then more likely to represent an earlier stage in the star formation process than those cores with methanol masers or uc hii   regions .",
    "spectral energy distribution modelling in subsequent papers will allow further investigation of the mm - only cores , in particular allowing better estimate of the temperature and hence the mass .",
    "the visual extinction ( @xmath50 ) and surface density ( @xmath10 ) of 392 sources have been estimated .",
    "the visual extinction of our sample varies from 10 to 500  mag with an average of 80  mag , implying a high degree of embedding .",
    "the surface density ( @xmath10 ) varies from 0.2 to 18.0  kg  m@xmath11 ( both extremes are mm - only cores ) , with an average of 2.8  kg  m@xmath11 .",
    "care must be taken in comparing surface densities among source classes , since this parameter depend on how well the source is resolved .",
    "it is clear ( c.f .",
    "[ correlations ] ) that the mass and radius of a source are highly correlated , with the more massive cores having larger radii . the h@xmath51 number density and",
    "the radius also appear to have a strong relation where the denser cores have smaller radii on average .",
    "there is a weak correlation between the mass and the h@xmath51 number density .",
    "the relation between the mass , mean h@xmath4 number density ( @xmath5 ) , and the radius of the cores is best described by the following two equations : m  @xmath44  r@xmath45 and @xmath5  @xmath44  r@xmath11 , where m , r , and @xmath5 are the mass , radius and h@xmath4 number density respectively .",
    "note that these relations are not inconsistent with m  @xmath44  @xmath5  r@xmath52 , despite the substitution of the fits in this formula giving m  @xmath44  r , rather then the fitted value of m  @xmath44  r@xmath45 .",
    "this is because this formula applies for a specific core , while the relations that we have obtained are for the average properties of the entire sample .",
    "this survey also revealed 20 maser sites and 9 uc hii   regions , which are devoid of millimetre continuum emission ( c.f .",
    "table [ no_mm ] ) .",
    "these sources were not specifically targeted in this survey , yet their coordinates fall within the fields mapped by simba .    the positions of 27 of these tracers have been determined via interferometry and hence are accurate to within @xmath28 .",
    "the methanol masers are not weaker on average than those methanol masers for which millimetre emission is detected .",
    "these 27 maser and radio continuum sources also occur at distances equivalent to those maser and uc hii   regions detected with millimetre continuum emission . assuming a maximum distance of 16.3  kpc for a particular maser or radio continuum source , then the 3@xmath53 upper limit at 1.2  mm",
    "would imply a mass of 600@xmath1 .",
    "figure [ correlations ] ( lower ) indicates that a particular maser or uc hii   region at this distance would not be detected in the survey with this mass .",
    "since the majority of sources have masses greater than this , it prompts us to ask why these methanol maser and uc hii   regions are devoid of millimetre continuum emission ? does the lack of millimetre emission suggest that these objects have characteristics dissimilar to those sites associated with massive star formation regions ?",
    "does the methanol maser and uc hii   region exist in the later stages of massive star formation , i.e. after the cold core phase , which is no longer detected at millimetre wavelengths ? can massive star formation occur without the presence of these ubiquitous tracers ? or are these objects simply too far away with masses too small to be detected by the sensitivity limit of the sest ? at this time we can not draw a secure conclusion , and further study of these sources is warranted .",
    "we have undertaken a millimetre continuum survey of 131 regions of massive star formation , traced by the presence of methanol maser and/or radio continuum emission , using the simba instrument on the sest .",
    "404 sources are detected in this survey .",
    "millimetre continuum emission is detected toward all of the methanol maser and uc hii   regions targeted ( 129 ) .",
    "the millimetre continuum emission is offset from the two nm-_iras _   positions however , but this may be attributed to the low resolution offered by _ iras _   in pinpointing the peak emission of the central core .    for 20 maser sites , and 9 uc hii   regions , within the surveyed fields ,",
    "millimetre continuum emission is not detected .",
    "further follow - up work of these objects is required in order to ascertain their nature and the reason for the lack of millimetre emission .",
    "it is not clear whether these are simply more distant objects where continuum emission falls below the detection limit .    also detected in this survey are sources that have no methanol maser or radio continuum emission indicative of msf . at a lower limit estimate ,",
    "45% of these cores are also devoid of mid - ir _ msx _   emission . the majority of these ` mm - only ' cores are separate from , and generally offset from , the targeted tracers in the same field .    in total , 253 new mm - only cores have been discovered .",
    "many of the fields contain multiple sources .",
    "it is therefore likely that the mm - only cores belongs to the same star formation complex as the methanol maser and uc hii   regions targeted in the study .",
    "the mass , radius and h@xmath4 number density ( @xmath5 ) have been determined from the millimetre flux and distance to the sources , assuming a temperature of 20  k.    analysis of the mm - only cores reveals that they are generally less massive than those sources with a maser and/or an uc hii   region , and also have smaller radii ( c.f .",
    "[ hist ] ) .",
    "the results from our analysis leads to two hypotheses about the nature of the mm - only cores .",
    "one possibility is that the mm - only core may be a precursor to the methanol maser in the evolutionary sequence of massive stars , the other is that the mm - only cores will simply give birth to intermediate mass stars ( i.e. no massive stars that will produce hii   regions ) .",
    "if so , the maximum stellar mass of a cluster is related to the mass of the core from which it forms .",
    "alternatively , the mm - only cores may in fact represent a cross - section of sources supporting both arguments .",
    "we note , that if the cores which only show millimetre emission are systematically cooler than the other classes of source , the temperature assumption of 20  k will introduce a bias , and the different mass distributions we have inferred may not actually occur . in this instance",
    ", only the first hypothesis above will apply . a better determination of the temperature of the cores is needed to constrain their masses in order to examine these hypotheses further .",
    "the relation between the mass , h@xmath4 number density ( @xmath5 ) , and the radius of the cores is best described by the following two equations : m  @xmath44  r@xmath45 and @xmath5  @xmath44  r@xmath11 .",
