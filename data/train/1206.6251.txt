    "one of these questions which is extensively debated in the current literature is the origin of the splitting of the lowest landau level and the emerging of insulating state at the dirac point.zhang2006,jiang,checkelsky,zhang2009,zhao12 even though the precise origin of this state is under current debate , it is generally believed that it is related to electron - electron interaction and spin effects .",

    "one of the motivations for such studies is related to advances in semiconductor spintronics utilizing the spin degree of freedom for adding new functionalities to electronic devices.@xcite some of proposed and investigated devices for spintronics and quantum computation applications operates in the edge state regime,@xcite which obviously requires a detailed knowledge of the structure of the states in a quantum wire or at the edge of the 2deg .",
    "the properties and detailed information about propagating states at the boundaries are also essential for interpretation of experiments in various electron interferometers in the quantum hall regime@xcite .",

    "at the same time , because of computational limitations , it is difficult to treat ribbons of widths exceeding 50 nm . therefore in our calculations we re - scale the system using ribbons of smaller width @xmath51 nm subjected to higher fields ( up to @xmath52 t ) in order to keep the ratio @xmath49 in accordance with typical experiments.molitor,oostinga,poumirol,ribeiro in very narrow ribbons the quantum confinement effects can dominate ribbon s electronic properties .",
    "thus , a concern might arise whether the obtained results remain valid for realistically wide ribbons . in the present section",
    "we investigate how nanoribbon s electronic properties such as the density distribution and the potential profile in the vicinity of the edge change with the increase of the ribbon s width , and find that the width of @xmath53 nm is already sufficient to capture all essential features of a wide ribbon or even a semi - infinite graphene sheet .",

    "we will demonstrate in the subsequent sections that main features in the spin polarization of the electron density and the enhancement of the @xmath0-factor are rather similar for both types of edges .",

    "the charge densities and potentials stay qualitatively the same as the nanoribbon width increases and exhibit practically no difference for 30- and 50-nm wide nanoribbons .",
    "we thus conclude that the transverse confinement does not change substantially for nanoribbons wider than @xmath58 nm , and the width @xmath59 nm is sufficient to describe realistically wide ribbons or even an edge of a graphene sheet .",
    "let us now focus on a difference in the potential profiles and the electron density distributions in a vicinity of a ribbon edge for armchair and zigzag ribbons .",

    "the potential profile for the case of zigzag ribbon exhibits somehow different features . as in the case of the armchair gnrs",

    "it is these trapped charges that raise the potential at the edges .",
    "they effectively repulse excess charges induced in the ribbon by the gate and prevent the triangular well to form near the boundary .",
    "therefore , the difference in the charge accumulation and potential profiles in the armchair and zigzag ribbons occurs due to topological property of the zigzag edge termination supporting the zero - energy mode .",

    "namely , as the magnetic field increases , the subbands first depopulate in the center and then near the edges .",
    "for example , the second subband ( i.e. ll1 ) is pinned to the fermi level in the ribbon center in the interval @xmath72 t. within this interval it forms the compressible strip which is manifested itself as the enhanced ldos and dos in figs . [ fig : dos](a ) and ( b ) .",

    "the hubbard interaction pushes up the spin - down subbands above the window @xmath91 such that it becomes depopulated , and the compressible strip in the middle is occupied by spin - up electrons only . as a result ,",
    "the dos at @xmath60 of the spin - up electrons is enhanced , while that one of the spin - down electrons is zero , see fig .",

    "when the magnetic field increases such that the ll1 is pushed above the @xmath94 the compressible strip in the middle disappears , the dos at @xmath60 for both spin species becomes equal to zero and the spin polarization vanishes .",

    "this is because in both cases the potential corresponds to the hard - wall confinement .",
    "the difference is that in ceoqw , as well as in conventional gaas split - gate wires@xcite , the polarization and thus the effective @xmath99-factor are enhanced by a factor of @xmath106 in comparison to the zeeman splitting , whereas in the armchair ribbons this enhancement it is just @xmath107 0.22 .",
    "this can be explained by fact that the bare @xmath0-factor in armchair gnrs is much larger that that one in gaas ( @xmath108 ) , such that zeeman interaction in graphene remains dominant in comparison to the exchange one .",
    "one more important difference of the graphene ribbons from the conventional gaas quantum wires is in the character of spin polarized edge states in the vicinity of the boundaries . in the conventional quantum wires",
    "the edge state of opposite spins are spatially separated.@xcite this is ultimately related to the formation of the compressible strips _ near the boundaries _ of the split - gate wire because of the soft confinement due to the gates.@xcite in gnr due to the hard - wall confinement the compressible strips do not form near the boundaries , and hence the spatial separation of the edge states of opposite spins does not occur .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in this respect the gnrs are also similar to ceoqw.@xcite    let us now turn to the case of zigzag nanoribbons .",
    "the main features of the spin polarization and the subband evolution are rather similar to the armchair ones .",
    "there is however one important difference related to the presence of the zero - energy mode residing at the zigzag edges .",
    "in contrast to other modes exhibiting successive population and depopulation of the landau levels in the middle of the ribbon , this mode always stays pinned to @xmath95 thus forming a compressible strip with the enhanced density of states at the edges for all magnetic fields .",

    "zigzag edges , the effective @xmath99-factor is strongly enhanced at low field ( when the zeeman spliting is small ) , and at higher fields it decreases to values @xmath109 comparable to those in the armchair gnrs , see fig .",

    "the defects scattering will modify gnrs conductance , especially for the low - velocity modes flowing in the middle of the ribbons . at the same time , the edge states corresponding to the classical skipping orbits are robust against the impurity scattering.@xcite    finally we note that we also performed similar computations of the spin polarization for gnrs using the density functional theory with the exchange functional proposed by polini _",

    "we find that the local spin polarization of the electron density and the total spin polarization exhibit a behavior similar to that one of the ldos and dos for spinless electrons .",
    "this similarity is not coincidental and reflects the fact that the regions with the enhanced dos correspond to compressible strips where the spin splitting of subbands takes place .",
    "we find that for the armchair ribbons in high magnetic field the effective @xmath0-factor varies between @xmath112 with the average value @xmath113 .",
    "for the zigzag nanoribbons we find that the zero - energy mode remains pinned to @xmath60 and becomes fully spin - polarized for all magnetic fields , which , in turn , leads to a strong spin polarization of the electron density near the zigzag edge . due to the contribution of the fully spin polarized zero - energy mode the effective @xmath99-factor in the armchair gnrs",
    "is strongly enhanced at low field ( when the zeeman splitting is small ) , and at higher fields it decreases to values @xmath114 comparable to those in the armchair gnrs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the main features of the spin polarization and the subband evolution in magnetic field resemble those in the cleaved - edge overgrown quantum wires ( ceoqw ) .",
    "this is because in both cases the potential corresponds to the hard - wall confinement .",
    "finally , we stress the importance of accounting for the global electrostatics in the system at hand for the accurate description of the spin polarization in gnrs .",
    "( in the present study it is done by accounting for the long - range coulomb interaction by means of the self - consistent hartree potential ) .",
    "this is because the global electrostatic is responsible for the formation of the compressible strips , and it is the compressible strips where the spin splitting of subbands takes place ."
