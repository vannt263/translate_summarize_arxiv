    "the local contribution to the total energy dissipation of the dw is weighted by the magnitude of the magnetization precession when @xmath11 or @xmath8 varies . for a fixed dw width , the total damping is not proportional to the volume of the scattering region but converges to a constant once the scattering region is large compared to the dw . in practice , @xmath12 and @xmath13 calculated using eqs .",

    "<S> , @xmath52 is reduced to 13.1  nm implying that nonlocal damping can play an important role in nanoscale magnetization textures in permalloy , whose length scale in experiment is usually about 100  nm and can be reduced to be even smaller than @xmath52 by manipulating the shape anisotropy of experimental samples  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in table  [ tab : parameters ] , @xmath52 is positively correlated with the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the large value of @xmath52 and the low resistivity of permalloy can be qualitatively understood in terms of its electronic structure and spin - dependent scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the ni and fe potentials seen by majority - spin electrons around the fermi level in permalloy are almost identical @xcite so that they are only very weakly scattered . </S>",

    "<S> both @xmath12 and @xmath13 originate from locally pumped spin currents proportional to @xmath66 . </S>",

    "<S> the more accurate form of the damping that we propose can be used to deduce the cits in magnetization textures where the usual way to study them quantitatively is by comparing experimental observations with simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> current - driven dws move with velocities that are proportional to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the nonadiabatic spin transfer torque parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the order of magnitude spread in values of @xmath73 deduced for permalloy from measurements of the velocities of vortex dws  @xcite may be a result of assuming that @xmath74 is a scalar constant . </S>",
