    "sdss j1531 + 3414 is a strong lensing cluster of galaxies at redshift @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based imaging of the cluster center reveals high surface brightness gravitational arcs from at least two lensed background galaxies at @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite , enabling weak- and strong - lensing analysis that yields a cluster mass of @xmath8 @xmath3   @xcite .",
    "the cluster core was recently imaged as part of strong lensing imaging program with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "these new high spatial resolution images reveal that the two giant elliptical galaxies in the cluster core are likely in the process of merging .",
    "most remarkably , the merger is associated with ongoing or very recent star formation arranged in a @xmath9 kpc - scale network of young stellar superclusters separated @xmath1 kpc in projection from one another along faint and narrow filaments , resembling a broken pearl necklace . while indeed strongly reminiscent of the well - known `` beads on a string '' mode of star formation frequently observed in the arms of spiral galaxies , resonance rings , and tidal arms that bridge interacting galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the morphology and orientation of this particular chain is unlike any known merging system , and the phenomenon is rarely ( if ever ) observed in giant early type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we present the new _ hst _ images of the merging elliptical galaxies and the associated network of young stellar superclusters .",
    "details of the observations are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] and  2 , and the results presented in  3 are discussed in  4 . throughout this letter",
    "we assume @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in this cosmology ,",
    "1  corresponds to 4.773 kpc at the redshift of the two merging ellipticals in the cluster center ( @xmath0 ) , where the associated luminosity and angular size distances are 984.4 and 1756.1 mpc , respectively , and the age of the universe is 9.954 gyr .",

    "initially intended to study the higher redshift background galaxies gravitationally lensed by the cluster , _ hst _ imaging of sdss j1531 + 3414 was obtained in cycle 20 ( go program 13003 , pi : gladders ) with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 , @xcite ) .",
    "the target was observed with four broadband filters over three _ hst _",
    "orbits , resulting in broad and essentially gap - free coverage over the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and optical wavelength range .",
    "this letter also presents follow - up nordic optical telescope ( not ) slit spectroscopy and a short iram 30-meter co@xmath16 observation .",
    "more information regarding all new data presented in this paper can be found in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the _ hst _ products were calibrated and reduced using the on - the - fly recalibration pipeline and the astrodrizzle / drizzlepac packages provided by the space telescope science institute @xcite .",
    "images were drizzled to the same 003 pixel frame using a 0.8 `` ` pixfrac ` '' gaussian kernel .",
    "an rgb `` pretty picture '' composite combining all four filters was made using the trilogy code kindly provided by dan coe ( see  2 of @xcite ) and the clash team @xcite .",
    "more details pertaining to reduction of the _ hst _ data can be found in @xcite .",
    "we present the new _ hst _ data as an rgb composite in fig .  1 .",
    "the images used in this composite are shown individually in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , which uses contours and labels to highlight various features of interest . as is evident from these figures , the cluster center harbors two elliptical galaxies whose nuclei are separated @xmath17 kpc ( 15 ) in projection from one another .",
    "the combined projected stellar envelope of both galaxies extends @xmath18 kpc ( @xmath19 ) across the major axis of the lowest surface brightness isophote , though their light is very centrally concentrated with an @xmath20-band petrosian radius of @xmath21 kpc ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "both new and archival optical spectroscopy confirms that this is no mere projection effect  the galaxies indeed share a common redshift , such that their stellar halos must be deeply embedded in one another over at least @xmath23 kpc scales .",
    "this is evident in archival sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) optical spectroscopy , which we present in the leftmost panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . while the sdss spectrum is from a fiber that covers the nuclei of both galaxies ( see top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , it features a singular line system including mg , na  d , and ca  ii h+k absorption tracing the old stellar component , all at a common redshift of @xmath24 ( consistent with the sdss photometric redshift ) .",
    "this serves as strong evidence that the galaxies are indeed merging , as they would have been bright enough to manifest as two distinct - redshift line systems if indeed they were two otherwise unrelated objects seen in projection .",
    "the merger hypothesis is confirmed by follow - up slit spectroscopy ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) obtained with the alfosc spectrograph on the nordic optical telescope ( not ) , the results of which are presented in the rightmost panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "as is evident from the [ o  ii ] and ca  ii lines extracted from the southeastern ( se ) and northwestern ( nw ) galaxy nuclei ( see bottom - right panel ) , the maximum spectroscopically permissible velocity offset between the galaxies is @xmath25 km sec , far too small for these to be unrelated galaxies in the hubble flow .",
    "any 3d configuration consistent with spectral constraints results in their stellar envelopes being deeply embedded in one another over @xmath26 kpc scales .",
    "we therefore conclude that the two ellipticals ( which are of roughly equal stellar mass , sharing similar surface brightnessess ) are undergoing a major merger .",
    "as noted above , the cluster mass derived from strong+weak lensing analysis is @xmath27 @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the implied projected 1d velocity dispersion from such a mass would be of order @xmath28 km sec , consistent with the measured velocity dispersion from 11 member galaxies of @xmath29 km sec@xcite .",
    "the expectation value for pairwise velocities along the line of sight would therefore be @xmath30 km sec , rather more than the @xmath31 km secpermitted by our follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the not data therefore suggest that the trajectories of the merger participants lie mostly in the plane of the sky . while the galaxy stellar isophotes are mostly smooth , unsharp masks and a f606w / f160w color map reveal residual surface brightness fluctuations between and around both nuclei , suggestive of some dynamical disturbance in the old stellar component as a result of the merger .",
    "count rate overdensities in the _ hst _ f390w image .",
    "the light blue histogram shows measured separations between clump centroids , and the dark blue histogram shows separation between the _ edges _ of those adjacent clumps , where a clump edge is roughly defined as the radial boundary encompassing @xmath32 of all flux associated with the clump .",
    "clump centroids are generally spaced @xmath33 kpc in projection from one another , whereas the projected separation between the edges of clumps is @xmath1 kpc .",
    "typical resolved clump diameters are @xmath1 kpc . on galaxy - wide scales ,",
    "the `` beads on a string '' mode of star formation is believed to be associated with the formation of jeans length superclusters separated by @xmath34 kpc from one another , consistent with what is observed here . ]",
    "far more dramatic than the merging galaxies is the f390w image of rest - frame nuv continuum emission mostly arising from young ( @xmath35 myr ) , massive ( @xmath36 @xmath3 ) stars .",
    "this is seen in blue on the rightmost panel of fig .  1 , and shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .  2 .",
    "the nuv continuum emission is shown in green contours on the f160w image in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "2 . not counting the nuclei of the two elliptical galaxies , the emission consists of at least 19 stellar superclusters ( or perhaps tidal dwarf galaxies ) @xmath37 kpc in diameter .",
    "the 19 stellar clusters are enhanced in nuv surface brightness by factors of @xmath38 over the filaments in which they are embedded .",
    "each of these superclusters are numerically labeled in the bottom - right panel of fig .  2 , which shows an unsharp mask revealing residual [ o  ii ] and blue excess emission in the f606w image .",
    "the young stellar superclusters are roughly equally spaced along @xmath39 narrow ( @xmath34 kpc wide ) , straight filaments roughly @xmath40 kpc in projected length , resembling `` beads on a string '' ( discussed in  4 ) . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] , a histogram of projected separations between neighboring stellar clusters reveals a strong peak around @xmath41 kpc .",
    "all 19 clusters are at least marginally resolved , and while most are roughly circular , a few ( especially cluster @xmath422 ) show evidence for @xmath43 pc - scale asymmetries reminiscent of tidal arms .    two filamentary strings of clusters ( containing clusters numbered @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the bottom - right panel of fig .  2 )",
    "are aligned along a position angle that is roughly parallel to the axis joining the nuclei of the two merging galaxies ( p.  a.@xmath46 , measured north through east ) .",
    "the other two strings ( containing clusters @xmath47 and @xmath48 , excluding # 13 ) lie along a p.  a.@xmath49 that is roughly perpendicular to this axis .",
    "the clusters are entirely contained within the combined projected old stellar envelope of both galaxies , within a circle of diameter @xmath9 kpc ( 56 ) . this can be seen in the top - left panel of fig .  2 , in which the nuv continuum emission is plotted in green contours over the f160w image , showing the old stellar population .",
    "1 .   it is a gravitationally lensed image ( or a set of images ) from a higher redshift background galaxy ( or multiple galaxies ) .",
    "2 .   it is a chance superposition along the line of sight , arising instead from a projection effect due to unrelated foreground sources .",
    "3 .   it arises from ongoing or very recent star formation taking place within the stellar envelope of the interacting elliptical galaxies .",
    "scenarios ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are entirely ruled out by spectroscopic evidence .",
    "the same sdss and not spectroscopy used to confirm that the two elliptical galaxies are indeed merging also confirms that h@xmath4 and [ o  ii ] emission from star formation is mapped to the same redshift of the galaxies at @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the stellar superclusters therefore must inhabit the combined stellar envelope of the merger participants .",
    "the integrated flux density of the nuv continuum in the f390w bandpass is @xmath50 erg sec  cm   , suggesting that line emission from the young stellar superclusters is easily bright enough to be detected in the spectroscopy . if at appreciably different redshift than the two galaxies with which the emission is cospatial , the redshift of the balmer lines should be offset from that of the mg and na  d absorption as well as the calcium break .",
    "moreover , strong lensing analysis ( sharon et al .  2014 , submitted to apj ) indicates that possible lensed images of background sources do not contribute significantly to the flux seen in the nuv emission . for the remainder of this letter",
    ", we therefore adopt the most evidence - supported scenario ( 3 ) , and conclude that ( a ) the two elliptical galaxies seen in close separation are indeed undergoing a major merger and ( b ) the clumpy nuv continuum emission arises from ongoing or recent star formation taking place within their combined stellar envelope .",
    "the integrated sdss h@xmath4 line flux from the 3  diameter fiber , which covers only the innermost region of the star forming chain ( see fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] , top right ) , is @xmath51 erg sec  cm  with a fwhm of @xmath52 km sec .",
    "we estimate internal extinction via the balmer decrement ( h@xmath4/h@xmath14 flux ratio ) , following the procedure described in @xcite and adopting `` case b '' recombination and the @xmath53 reddening - to - extinction law of @xcite . after an additional correction for foreground milky way extinction using @xmath54 , we estimate an extinction - corrected h@xmath4 luminosity of @xmath55 erg sec  from the region covered by the sdss fiber . as part of our not / alfosc observations",
    ", we used a 25 wide slit to observe the stellar superclusters in h@xmath4 , as detailed in figure 3 .",
    "this slit encompasses all of the nuv identified clumps , even after accounting for minimal slit losses given ground - based seeing .",
    "the derived h@xmath4 line flux from our alfosc data is 1.7 times greater than that reported by sdss , approximately as expected given the more complete spatial coverage of the clumps by the wide slit observation . including a 30% uncertainty to account for spectrograph ccd fringing and our [ n  ii ] contamination correction",
    ", the implied total extinction - corrected h@xmath4 luminosity for the entire system is @xmath56 erg sec .    by eq .  2 in @xcite , this extinction - corrected h@xmath4 luminosity corresponds to a ( very rough and assumption - heavy ) star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath57 @xmath3  yr .",
    "automated modeling of the sdss spectrophotometric data by @xcite , which matches sed templates to extinction - corrected sdss @xmath58 magnitudes , yields an sfr of @xmath59 @xmath3  yr  and a total stellar mass of @xmath60 @xmath3  ( for more details , see @xcite ) . absent the follow - up data needed for a more robust analysis , the remainder of this letter assumes that the sfr is roughly in the range of @xmath61 @xmath3  yr .",
    "each clump contributes approximately @xmath62 of the total nuv flux , which should roughly scale to its relative contribution to the total star formation rate .",
    "we therefore estimate that the clumps have an associated star formation rate in the range of @xmath63 @xmath3  yr .    inverting the @xcite calibration of the molecular schmidt law @xcite and",
    "assuming gas depletion times in the range of @xmath34 gyr , the total sfr translates to a rough associated molecular gas mass of @xmath64 @xmath3 .",
    "we obtained an iram 30 m telescope co@xmath16 observation in an attempt to measure the actual cold gas mass .",
    "no line was detected at a sensitivity of 0.9 mk @xmath65 per 80 km sec  channel , setting a 1@xmath66 upper limit of @xmath67 @xmath3   of molecular gas , assuming a line width of 220 km s   and a galactic @xmath68 factor .",
    "a molecular gas mass in the range of @xmath69 @xmath3would be @xmath70 that of the galaxies stellar mass , consistent with that observed in large samples of early type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed star formation in sdss 1531 is strongly reminiscent of the well - known `` beads on a string '' mode of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) frequently observed in the arms of spiral galaxies @xcite , resonance rings @xcite , and tidal arms that bridge interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "beads on a string star formation is a kpc - scale manifestation of the jeans length , and the physics governing the system is analogous to the plateau - rayleigh instability causing ( e.g. ) a continuous column of falling water to disrupt , explaining why rain falls in drops rather than in unbroken filaments from the sky ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite being broadly categorized as `` red and dead '' , it has been known for a number of years that star formation can be relatively abundant in both cluster and field ellipticals @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the formation of `` beads on a string '' stellar superclusters in major , likely gas - rich mergers between giant ellipticals is rarely ( if ever ) observed , regardless of whether or not the star formation is driven by a merger or a cooling flow ( e.g. , tremblay et al .  2014b , in prep ) .",
    "the unusual system in sdss 1531 is likely a serendipitous snapshot of what may be a very short - lived morphology , presenting a unique opportunity to study star formation and gas dynamical response in a tidal field governed by dynamical friction , shear , and gravitational torques associated with the two merging ellipticals .",
    "forthcoming cluster mass reconstruction from strong lensing ( sharon et al .",
    "2014 , submitted to apj . )",
    "will provide a well - constrained canvas against which these kinematics may be studied .",
    "these quantitative analyses , however , await the necessary multiwavelength follow - up data .",
    "recently obtained gemini gmos - n ifu observations ( tremblay et al .",
    "2014c , in prep ) will disentangle the kinematics , dynamical timescales , and 3d geometry of the system , as well as local internal extinction corrections required for a better sfr estimate .",
    "alma is the only facility with the sensitivity and resolution needed to independently constrain the clump - by - clump sfr and molecular gas masses .    finally , _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations would determine whether or not the observed star formation might originate from gas that has condensed from the ambient hot atmosphere via a cooling flow , or a shock in the x - ray gas driven by colliding hot halos from the galaxy merger .",
    "the location of the stellar superclusters leaves this origin question open , as the star formation is not occurring in a region between the merging galaxies , where one would most obviously expect it if the star formation is shock triggered",
    ". however , viscous drag effects preferentially influencing the gas may be responsible for the apparent dislocation of the stellar ( and presumably dark matter mass ) components from the gas , as has been observed in other galaxy cluster mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
