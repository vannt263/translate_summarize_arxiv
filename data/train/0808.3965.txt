    "the study of quantum field theories in the presence of external fields is a rich subject . in the pioneering work of euler and heisenberg ,",
    "the one - loop effective action for qed was exactly computed for the special case of a constant electromagnetic field .",
    "this result was later formalized by schwinger  @xcite in an essentially modern way .",
    "such non - perturbative solutions provide important insight into vacuum structure , renormalization , and the behavior of pertubative approximations , see  @xcite for a review of effective actions and more recent developments .    probing a complicated theory like qcd with external electromagnetic fields",
    "provides a lever - arm with which to study the modification of vacuum and hadron structure .",
    "this in turn gives insight into the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "in external electromagnetic fields , model field theories , and low - energy models of qcd have been studied  @xcite , as well as the qcd vacuum  @xcite . a striking fact about the qcd vacuum",
    "is that it spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry , which is evidenced by the non - zero value of the quark condensate . because electromagnetic fields couple directly to quarks , the behavior of the condensate , and hence the ground state of qcd , will be affected by external fields .",
    "there have been numerous studies of the effects of strong fields on the condensate .",
    "focusing on the model - independent investigations using chiral perturbation theory , the calculation of the condensate in a constant magnetic field at zero quark mass has been carried out  @xcite , and additionally calculations have included the effect of finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the external field dependence of the chiral condensate has also been recently investigated in the more realistic scenario of non - vanishing quark mass in constant electromagnetic fields  @xcite . as the condensate lowers the vacuum energy ,",
    "it can be expected that the addition of a magnetic field ( which contributes positively to the action density , @xmath0 ) will strengthen spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by increasing the condensate . on the other hand ,",
    "the addition of an electric field ( which contributes negatively to the action density , @xmath1 , and has associated instabilities ) weakens chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these heuristic expectations are verified by the explicit model - independent calculations using chiral perturbation theory .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the modification of hadron structure in strong fields .",
    "we use chiral perturbation theory to investigate pion and nucleon properties in constant electric and magnetic fields .",
    "chiral dynamics affords us the systematic and model - independent tool to investigate the modification of hadron structure in external fields . in electric and magnetic fields , we determine the effective mass of charged and neutral pions , as well as of the proton and neutron . the results for charged and neutral pions are shown to satisfy a generalized form of the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation . while the derived results are at a fixed order in the chiral expansion , they are non - perturbative in the strength of the external field . for sufficiently weak fields ,",
    "the derived mass shifts of the pions and nucleons correctly reproduce the well - known electric and magnetic polarizabilities from one - loop chiral perturbation theory .",
    "expanding about the weak field limit allows us to investigate the behavior of perturbative approximations , and directly confront the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "we see explicitly the behavior of perturbative approximations beyond the expansion s regime of validity .",
    "in this situation , the leading term gives the best approximation , which can be remarkably good .",
    "we speculate about the presence of this phenomenon in a few other systems .",
    "our study of hadrons in strong electric and magnetic fields is additionally motivated by lattice gauge theory simulations  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the qcd vacuum and spectrum can be studied in the presence of electromagnetic fields using external field techniques with lattice qcd . for small field strengths , the response of hadrons is governed by their multipole moments and multipole polarizabilities .",
    "these are coefficients of the first few terms in a weak - field expansion of a hadron s two - point function in the external field .",
    "the introduction of constant gauge fields on a torus , however , requires quantization conditions on the strength of the field  @xcite . to achieve the smallest values of constant fields , the generic quantization condition has the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lattice spacing , @xmath4 represents the non - vanishing components of the field strength , @xmath5 the number of the lattice sites in the direction specified by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is an integer .",
    "satisfying the quantization condition on current lattices , @xmath8 , inevitably leads to non - perturbative effects from pion loops because the ratio @xmath9 is not considerably smaller than unity .",
    "furthermore as the lattice pion masses are brought down to the physical point ( at fixed lattice sizes ) , this ratio will exceed unity .",
    "extraction of moments and polarizabilities will then be obscured by non - perturbative effects .",
    "to address these effects , we determine the behavior of pion and nucleon two - point functions in external fields to all orders in the ratio of field strength to pion mass squared .",
    "furthermore the study of hadronic two - point functions in strong external fields extends the method proposed in  @xcite for extracting charged particle properties from lattice qcd .",

    "pi ] , we study the effects of strong electric and magnetic fields on pions . to begin ,",
    "we review the chiral lagrangian in section  [ s : pil ] , and derive the charged pion propagator in a strong - field power counting .",
    "one - loop computations are pursued in sections  [ s : pib ] and [ s : pie ] , where we derive the shift in the effective mass due to external magnetic and electric fields , respectively .",
    "expanding the non - perturbative results in powers of the external field allows us to explore the behavior of asymptotic expansions .",

    "we confirm that the proton @xmath10-decays in strong magnetic fields .",
    "surprisingly the leading and next - to - leading contributions to this effect arise from terms that are completely local in the effective theory .",

    "to investigate the properties of hadrons in strong external fields , we turn to chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "chiral dynamics is based solely on the symmetries of low - energy qcd ; and , as such , provides a model - independent description of hadrons in terms of a few parameters determined from phenomenology . when electromagnetically gauged , the chiral theory can be used to derive electromagnetic properties of hadrons .    in the absence of external fields and at zero quark mass , the lagrangian of qcd has a @xmath11 chiral symmetry chiral limit .",

    "terms with higher powers of the external field are suppressed by the chiral symmetry breaking scale , and first occur in the @xmath82 lagrangian .",
    "there is an additional field - dependent term that can potentially contribute from the fourth - order lagrangian .",
    "this term is @xmath83 given the structure of this operator , it can be removed with a field redefinition of @xmath16 resulting in a multiplicative renormalization of the mass term in eq .  .",
    "this renormalization does not depend on the external field strength , and thus only modifies the bare pion mass .",

    "diagrams @xmath90@xmath85 are related by gauge invariance ; their contributions should be accordingly grouped in a gauge covariant fashion .",
    "a particularly useful simplification to note is that there are no loop contractions of @xmath91 with @xmath48 .",
    "this is obvious for the neutral pion because the covariant derivative is simply a partial derivative and the loop integration must vanish by lorentz invariance : @xmath92 for the charged pions , one must use the explicit form of the propagator eq .   to see that such contractions also vanish .",
    "basically the covariant derivative of the self - contracted propagator ends up without coordinate dependence , hence has no four - direction in which to point .",
    "thus there are only two ways the covariant derivatives can act to produce a nonzero result : either both act on the fields contracted to the external legs , or both act inside the loop .",
    "consider contractions where both covariant derivatives act on the external legs .",
    "in this case , the remaining two pion fields are contracted to form the tadpole which by eq .",
    "is independent of the vertex location .",

    "the flavor and overall normalization factors are the same as the wavefunction renormalization , hence that contribution is effectively doubled .",
    "to present the final results , we must renormalize our expressions .",
