    "the redshifted 21 cm line emission from neutral hydrogens is a promising way to probe epoch of reionization ( eor ) , cosmic dawn and dark age @xcite because it reflects the physical state of intergalactic gas .",
    "actually , the brightness temperature depends on quantities crucial for the understanding of these epochs , such the neutral hydrogen fraction , spin temperature and baryon density .",
    "however , the observation of the redshifted 21 cm signal is very challenging due to the presence galactic and extragalactic foreground emissions , low - frequency radio telescopes such as murchison widefield array ( mwa ) @xcite , low frequency array ( lofar ) @xcite and paper @xcite have started their observations and set upper bounds on the brightness temperature .",
    "the upper bounds will improve further as our understanding of the foreground proceeds and the subtraction techniques become more sophisticated .",
    "ultimately , the square kilometre array ( ska ) @xcite and hydrogen epoch of reionization array ( hera ) @xcite will perform precise observations and will reveal the physical process of eor and cosmic dawn .",
    "one of the useful tools to extract information from observed data is to take the power spectrum of fluctuations in brightness temperature at a fixed redshift ( frequency ) .",
    "this is effective even for relatively low s / n data , which could be obtained by ongoing telescopes , while making a map of brightness temperature through imaging requires much higher sensitivity the ska is expected to have .",
    "actually , the power spectrum of brightness temperature has been studied by many authors .",
    "when fluctuations follow gaussian probability distribution , they can be well characterized by the power spectrum and higher - order statistics such as bispectrum and trispectrum have no further independent information . however , since reionization is a highly non - gaussian process which involves non - linear density fluctuations , star formation and expansion of hii bubbles , the brightness temperature fluctuations are also expected to be strongly non - gaussian @xcite . in this case",
    ", the power spectrum does not have sufficient information to describe the fluctuations and higher - order statistics have independent and complimentary information @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a formalism to calculate the errors in bispectrum measurement contributed from thermal noise .",
    "noise estimation has been studied by many authors in case of power spectrum @xcite , and we extend the formalism given in @xcite . starting from the error in visibility obtained by a single baseline , we consider its summation over the baseline distribution in @xmath4 plane .",
    "a striking feature of thermal - noise bispectrum is that its ensemble average vanishes because thermal noise is gaussian .",
    "nevertheless , thermal noise contributes to the bispectrum error through its variance . considering the variance of thermal noise error is the main extention to the previous formalism .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section 2",
    ", we define the brightness temperature , it s power spectrum and bispectrum . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the formalism of calculation of thermal - noise power spectrum given by @xcite .",
    "then , we develop a formalism for bispectrum and estimate thermal - noise bispectrum for several specific configuration of the wave number in section 4 .",
    "the summary and discussion will be given in section 5 . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we define basic quantities concerning the 21 cm signal .",
    "the brightness temperature @xmath7 is defined by spin temperature offsetting from cmb temperature , @xmath8 , \\label{eq : brightness}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the neutral fraction of hydrogen , @xmath10 is the matter over density , @xmath11 is the hubble parameter and @xmath12 is the velocity gradient along the line of sight . then we introduce fluctuation of @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average value of brightness temperature , @xmath16 is spatial position .",
    "the power spectrum of brightness temperature is defined from its fourier transform , @xmath17 , as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the ensemble average , @xmath20 is position in fourier space .",
    "the bispectrum @xmath21 can be defined in a similar way : @xmath22 here the delta function forces the three wave vectors to make a triangle and @xmath21 is dependent on only two of the three vectors ( chosen @xmath23 and @xmath24 here ) due to this triangle condition .",
    "in this section , we summarize a formalism to estimate the thermal noise for power spectrum , following @xcite .",
    "first , we define visibility @xmath25 for a pair of antennae as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the thermal - noise temperature , @xmath28 is the direction of primely beam , @xmath29 is observed frequency and @xmath30 is a product of the window functions concering the field of view and bandwidth .",
    "the rms thermal - noise fluctuation per visibility is given by , @xmath31 , \\label{visnoise}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the observed wavelength , @xmath33 is the total system temperature , @xmath34 is the effective area of antenna , @xmath35 is the width of the frequency channel and @xmath36 is total observing time . by fourier transforming the visibility in the frequency direction , we obtain , @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the bandwidth , @xmath39 is the @xmath40-th frequency channel and we define @xmath41 .    the covariance matrix of detector noise for a single baseline is given by , @xmath42 where",
    ", we used the definition of power spectrum for noise temperature ( eq . [ eq : ps_def ] ) in third equality and assumed that the covariance vanishes when @xmath43 in the last equality .",
    "further , we assumed that the power spectrum is constant for a range where the window function have non - zero value and we pulled @xmath44 out of the integration .",
    "then the integration of window functions can be evaluated as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the field of view .",
    "thus we obtain , @xmath47    on the other hand , the covariance matrix for a single baseline can be evaluated from eq .",
    "( [ visnoise ] ) , @xmath48 again , we assumed that there is no correlation between the thermal noise with different @xmath49 and @xmath29 .",
    "if multiple baselines contribute to the same pixel , the observing time is effectively increased .",
    "here we assume that the number density of the baselines in @xmath4-plane is constant under rotation with respect to @xmath50-axis , that is , depends only on @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the angle between @xmath53 and @xmath50-axis .",
    "therefore , the effective observing time @xmath54 can be written as , @xmath55 here @xmath56 represents area per pixel on @xmath4-plane which reflects the resolution on @xmath4-plane and @xmath57 is the number density of baselines on @xmath4-plane .",
    "thus , we obtain the covariance matrix for a pixel in @xmath58-space , replacing @xmath36 with @xmath59 , as , @xmath60 thus , comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq : cn ] ) and substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : tu ] ) , we obtain , @xmath61    now we convert the noise power spectrum of @xmath53 space to the one of cosmological fourier space @xmath62 . using the following relations @xmath63 where , @xmath64 is the hubble constant , @xmath65 is the frequency of 21 cm radiation and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the density parameter of matter and we assumed the flat universe .",
    "thus , we obtain , @xmath68    because the power spectrum of 21 cm signal is dependent only on the length of the wave vector , we take a sum of the above noise power spectrum over a spherical shell which corresponds to the same @xmath69 .",
    "first , we consider an annulus with radial width @xmath70 and angular width @xmath71 .",
    "noting that the baseline distribution is assumed to be uniform in an annulus , the number of pixels in the annulus is , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the observed volume in real space , @xmath74 is the resolution in fourier space and the other factor , @xmath75 , is the annulus volume in fourier space",
    ". then the noise power spectrum ruduces by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "next , we consider a sum over @xmath52 .",
    "taking @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a constant factor which we set equal to 0.5 , the spherically averaged sensitivity is given by , @xmath79^{-1/2 } \\approx \\left [ k^3 \\int_{\\arccos[\\min(\\frac{y k}{2 \\pi},1)]}^{\\arcsin[\\min(\\frac{k_*}{k } , 1 ) ] } ~ d \\theta \\,\\sin{\\theta } \\frac{\\epsilon ( n(k \\sin{\\theta}))^2 a_e^3 b^2 t_0 ^ 2}{(2 \\pi)^2 x^2 y \\lambda^6 t_{\\rm sys}^4 } \\right]^{-1/2 } , \\label{eq : dpk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the longest transverse wave vector , which corresponds to the maximum baseline length . the lower limit of the integral corresponds to the pixel size .",
    "in this section , we estimate the bispectrum from the thermal noise in a similar way in the previous section .",
    "however , we should notice that , because the thermal noise is gaussian , its bispectrum is actually zero .",
    "nontheless , its statistical fluctuation , that is , its variance is non zero and contributes to the noise to the bispectrum signal .",
    "thus , the calculation in this case is more subtle than that of the power spectrum , although we can use similar techniques as we see below . in @xcite ,",
    "an order estimation for the thermal noise bispectrum has been done without considering this fact and also the baseline distribution .      remembering the definition of the bispectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_def ] ) , the covariance of the bispectrum can be defined by , @xmath81 where each bispectrum satisfies the triangular condition ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 comes from the fact that there is no correlation unless the two triangles , ( @xmath85 ) and ( @xmath86 ) , coincide .",
    "next , we consider ensemble average of the product of six noise intensities , denoted as @xmath87 , @xmath88 to proceed further , we substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : covbb ] ) and consider the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) .",
    "@xmath89 this is non - zero only when @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( and then @xmath92 from the triangular conditions ) . if these conditions are satisfied , @xmath93 where we used eq .",
    "( [ window ] ) and @xmath94 and assumed @xmath95 is approximately constant within the window function .",
    "thus , taking other terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) into account , we have , @xmath96    on the other hand , the product of six noise intensities can also be calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath97 where we used wick theorem in the second equality and eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise_pix ] ) in the last equality .    thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c_b1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c_b2 ] ) , we obtain , @xmath98 converting the argument from @xmath53 to @xmath62 , we finally obtain , @xmath99 this equation corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise_pix ] ) for the power spectrum , if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : tu ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we take a sum of the noise bispectrum over spherical shell as we did for the power spectrum in the previous section .",
    "however , the situation is much more complicated in the case of bispectrum , because @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be all different with each other in general so that we must consider two spherical shells with the radius @xmath102 and @xmath103 , while @xmath101 is determined by the triangular condition , @xmath104 . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the noise bispectrum for equilateral type ( @xmath105 ) and isosceles type ( @xmath106 ) and define @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "first , as in the case of the power spectrum , @xmath109 can run over a spherical shell with radius @xmath69 which can be parametrized by two of the spherical coordinate of @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "further , for a fixed @xmath109 , there is a rotational degree of freedom for @xmath111 with respect to @xmath109 , which is denoted by an angle @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "thus , we need to integrate the covariance matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : covbb ] ) with respect to @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath112 .",
    "noting that the covariance matrix does not depend on @xmath115 , the weight of the integration , which corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ pixnum ] ) , is given by @xmath116    \\times    \\left [ k^2 \\sin{\\theta_2 } \\sin{\\gamma } ~ \\delta k",
    "\\delta \\theta_2           \\delta \\alpha \\frac{v}{(2\\pi)^3 }    \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first factor comes from the sum for @xmath109 over the spherical shell and the second factor takes the rotational degree of freedom of @xmath111 for each @xmath109 into account . here",
    "@xmath117 is the polar angle of @xmath111 and @xmath118 is the angle @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 is the width of the annulas of @xmath111 when @xmath109 is fixed , which we set equal to the resolution in fourier space , @xmath122 .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath117 by @xmath114 , @xmath112 and the angle between @xmath109 and @xmath111 denoted as @xmath123 .",
    "noting @xmath111 can be express as @xmath124 we obtain , @xmath125 then , setting @xmath77 and @xmath126 , the bispectrum variance due to the thermal noise is written by an integrate with respect to @xmath114 and @xmath112 , @xmath127^{-1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{(2\\pi)^{\\frac{5}{2}}}{\\sqrt{\\delta \\theta_2 } k k^{3/2 } \\epsilon }      \\bigg(\\frac{x^2y \\lambda^2}{a_e}\\bigg )      \\bigg(\\frac{t^2_{\\rm sys } \\lambda^2}{a_e b t_0}\\bigg)^{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left[\\int { d\\theta_1 } \\int { d\\alpha } \\sin{\\theta_1 } \\sin{\\theta_2 }                   \\sin{\\gamma(\\theta_1,\\alpha ) }                   ~ n({{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_1 ) n({{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_2 ) n({{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_3 )             \\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a general expression for isosceles - type bispectrum .",
    "for equilateral type , we just set @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "to calculate the bispectrum sensitivity , we need the number density of baselines on uv - plane . in this paper",
    ", we consider expanded mwa , lofar and ska .",

    "in this paper , we esimated the bispectrum of thermal noise for redshifted 21 cm signal observation for epock of reionization by extending the formalism of the noise power spectrum estimation given by @xcite .",
    "because thermal noise was assumed to be gaussian , the ensamble average of the bispectrum vanishes and its variance contributes to the noise to the bispectrum signal .",
    "we developed a formalism to calculate the noise bispectrum for an arbitrary triangle , taking the array configuration into account .",
    "we applied it to the cases with equilateral and isosceles triangles and estimated the noise bispectrum for expanded mwa , lofar and the ska .",
    "consequently , it was found that the ska has enough sensitivity for @xmath2 for both types of triangles . on the other hand , lofar will have sensitivity for the peaks of the bispectrum as a function of redshift .",
    "the expanded mwa has even less sensitivity but it will be possible to put a meaningful constraints on model parameters which induce larger signals than those with the parameters used in this paper .",
    "not only the themal noise but signal of bispectrum depend on the configuration of the triangle of three wave numbers .",
    "it is possible that the signal bispectrum has a large amplitude for a specific configuration of the triangle and observation may become easier in that case .",
    "an investigation of the details of the bispectrum signal and comparison with noise bispectrum will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    actually , thermal noise is just one of many obstacles for the observation of 21 cm signal .",
    "other serious sources of noise are galactic and extragalactic foreground and sample variance , and the foreground emission has not been well understood even for power spectrum",
    ". it may be helpful to consider the `` eor window '' for bispectrum as in the case of power spectrum @xcite .",
    "it would turn out that small - k modes should be discarded to avoid foreground and , if this is the case , the total signal - to - noise ratios in table [ table : signal_to_noise ] are overestimation .",
    "further , for a practical application of bispectrum analysis to survey data , we need to take survey geometry into account @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the observation of the bispectrum is very important because 21 cm signal from epoch of reionization is highly non - gaussian so that the bispectrum will give us enormous information complementary to the power spectrum .",
