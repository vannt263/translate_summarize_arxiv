    "haider and liu realized in 1986 that a moderately attractive @xmath0 interaction , with scattering length estimated as @xmath8 fm , may lead to a robust pattern of @xmath2-nuclear bound states across the periodic table beginning with @xmath9c @xcite .",
    "their pioneering work has been followed by numerous studies of the @xmath0 interaction within various theoretical models that yielded a wide range of values for re  @xmath10 from 0.2 fm @xcite to about 1.0 fm @xcite , as summarized in 2005 by arndt et al .",
    "@xcite . among the very recent works demonstrating this large variation we mention the @xmath11@xmath0@xmath12@xmath13 coupled - channel chiral model of mai , bruns , meiner @xcite with values of re  @xmath14  fm and 0.38  fm in its two versions , and the @xmath15-matrix analysis involving additional channels by shklyar , lenske , mosel @xcite with re  @xmath16  fm . this wide range of values introduces considerable uncertainty into the evaluation of @xmath2-nuclear spectra , as shown very recently by friedman , gal , mare ( fgm ) @xcite for @xmath5 nuclear bound states .",
    "calculated @xmath5 binding energies in @xmath17pb , for example , range approximately between 10 and 30 mev . generally and as naively expected , the larger and hence more attractive re  @xmath10 is , the larger is the calculated binding energy of a given @xmath5 nuclear state . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath2-nuclear interaction generated from the green - wycech ( gw ) @xcite re  @xmath18  fm amplitude is sufficiently strong to bind additional single - particle @xmath2 states in heavy nuclei , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] of the present work .",
    "regarding i m  @xmath10 , most analyses result in a much narrower interval of values between 0.2 to 0.3 fm .",
    "therefore , one might think that calculated widths of @xmath2-nuclear states should exhibit little model dependence . however , this expectation is not borne out in the very recent calculations by fgm that find widths of the @xmath5 state in @xmath17pb ranging from a few mev to about 25 mev , depending on the assumed @xmath0 interaction model .",
    "an important lesson of the fgm work is that the in - medium @xmath0 scattering amplitudes that serve input in the calculation of @xmath2-nuclear bound states can not be determined in terms of threshold @xmath0 scattering amplitudes alone , be it free - space or in - medium threshold amplitudes .",
    "it was shown that @xmath0 scattering amplitudes down to about 50 mev below threshold are involved in @xmath2-nuclear bound state calculations @xcite . in the coupled - channel studies of the @xmath1 resonance region cited above , the extrapolation from @xmath19  mev to the @xmath0 threshold at @xmath20  mev and further down to",
    "the @xmath0 subthreshold region introduces appreciable model dependence which is reflected in the large span of reported values for @xmath10 , particularly for its real part .",
    "the only model - independent property shared by such studies is that both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude decrease steadily as one goes below the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",

    "represented by @xmath2 nuclear complex binding energies @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 remains dominantly real but with magnitude less than one , typically 0.5 .",
    "we have used expression ( [ eq : wrwfg ] ) to revise the fgm bound - state calculations done for @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to a moderate increase of the @xmath2-nuclear attraction and , consequently , to binding energies that are somewhat larger , by a few mev at most , than those reported by fgm @xcite . the calculated widths hardly change .",
    "the primary aim of the present work is to extend the fgm analysis by using in - medium @xmath0 interactions constructed here within the recent chirally - inspired meson - baryon coupled - channel model by ciepl and smejkal ( cs ) @xcite in which self - energy insertions , disregarded by fgm @xcite , are now included .",
    "this construction follows a similar one by these authors for in - medium @xmath23-wave @xmath44 interactions in ref .",
    "@xcite where several @xmath45-nuclear applications are reviewed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding in - medium @xmath0 scattering amplitudes @xmath27 are applied in the present work directly within a comprehensive study of @xmath2-nuclear bound states , without having to approximate in - medium amplitudes by using the multiple - scattering expressions ( [ eq : wrw ] ) and ( [ eq : wrwfg ] ) ( which nevertheless are found to provide a very good approximation to within few percent ) .",
    "comparison is also made with another study done within a different coupled - channel approach @xcite and its in - medium implementation @xcite , and with a different procedure of handling the energy dependence of in - medium @xmath0 scattering amplitudes in @xmath2-nuclear bound - state calculations @xcite .    for a given @xmath0 interaction model",
    ", the calculation of @xmath2-nuclear bound states in the present work follows the same steps introduced by fgm @xcite .",
    "thus , one solves the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation @xmath46\\:\\psi=0 \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : kg}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 the binding energy and the width of the @xmath2-nuclear bound state , respectively .",
    "the self - energy operator @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the nuclear density ( normalized to the number of nucleons @xmath6 ) and @xmath54 is the lorentz invariant mandelstam variable .",
    "the factor @xmath55 transforms the in - medium cm scattering amplitude @xmath56 to the corresponding laboratory ( lab ) amplitude which for @xmath57 is the one relevant in @xmath2-nuclear calculations . in the lab system , in distinction from the @xmath0 two - body cm system where @xmath58 , the two momenta are determined separately by the nuclear medium and their combined contribution is well approximated by a non - zero @xmath59 term . including this negative - definite contribution to @xmath23 in the evaluation of @xmath27 weakens both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath51 self - energy input to the kg equation , reducing thereby the calculated @xmath2-nuclear binding energy and width with respect to all other calculations that preceded fgm .",
    "the actual binding energy and width calculation requires a _ self - consistent _ procedure , since each of the four kinematical variables @xmath60 , @xmath32 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 of which @xmath22 consists depends in the nuclear medium on the nuclear density @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , as discussed below in sect .  [",
    "sec : sc ] , @xmath61 depends on @xmath53 primarily through the self - energy @xmath51 , so even the input self - energy operator requires iterative cycles to become uniquely determined .",
    "previous @xmath2-nuclear calculations were only concerned with the dependence of the input @xmath22 ( through the @xmath63 term ) on the output binding energy @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "another improvement offered here , as well as in the recent fgm calculation , consists of solving rmf equations of motion for the in - medium nucleons in sequence and self - consistently @xcite with the @xmath2-nuclear kg equation , thereby allowing the @xmath2 meson to polarize the nuclear core .",
    "however , the core polarization effect on @xmath49 and @xmath50 was found in these dynamical calculations to be smaller than 1  mev , thus justifying the use of static nuclear densities at the present state of the art in @xmath2-nuclear calculations .",
