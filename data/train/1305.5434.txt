    "self - propelled objects moving in confining environments at low reynolds numbers exhibit interesting physical properties , some of which are not yet well understood and deserve to be studied in view of their technological applications .",
    "these objects range from artificial microswimmers that can be actuated upon by using applied magnetic fields  @xcite to motile cancer  @xcite and stem  @xcite cells , to motile bacteria  @xcite and spermatozoa  @xcite .",
    "the study of their properties in confined regions has been made possible by recent advances in microfabrication  @xcite and observation  @xcite techniques .    aside from the intrinsic problems posed by the motion of confined , self - propelled , run - and - tumble microorganisms ,",
    "there is strong interest in the biomedical and engineering communities in efficiently controlling microorganism motion . a physical , nondestructive method of achieving this control",
    "is suggested by the geometrically - induced guidance caused by the walls of asymmetric openings , the funnels .",
    "this ratchet effect was first used by galajda and coworkers to generate an inhomogeneous bacterial distribution  @xcite .",
    "the otherwise random motion of bacteria was controlled , _",
    "i.e _ rectified , by the funnels in the box .",
    "since bacteria swim parallel to the funnel walls , it is easier for them to cross the barrier from the wide to the narrow funnel opening than in the opposite direction .",
    "the funnels then define a preferred direction for the swimmer motion , leading to an increase in the cell concentration on one side of the box and a consequent decrease on the other .",
    "this effect was also recently observed in the puller eukaryote swimmer _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the rectification process can be reversed if chemotactic or collective motions prevail , as shown in refs .  @xcite .",
    "various aspects of the microorganism dynamics have been the subject of recent studies  @xcite .",
    "this rectification effect can be particularly useful when there are mixtures of microorganisms exhibiting different motility strategies . in this connection it is worth mentioning that various microfluidic techniques for sorting motile microscopic objects have been developed in the last few years .",
    "this is the case for the separation of motile from non - motile sperm cells  @xcite , the sorting of _",
    "e. coli _ by length  @xcite , the use of self - driven artificial microswimmers for the separation of binary mixtures of colloids  @xcite and the study of the dynamics of several kinds of particles combining asymmetric obstacles and a time - dependent voltage  @xcite .",
    "one of their objectives is to eliminate the cellular stress and damage associated with alternative techniques such as centrifugation .",
    "geometrical sorting also avoids the use of applied fields or chemical gradients , whose maintenance at scales of the millimeter or longer is difficult  @xcite .",
    "would it be also possible to use the rectification effect to efficiently sort cells by their swimming strategies ?",
    "this is the question we would like to answer in this paper .",
    "given their ubiquity , motile bacteria are of particular interest .",
    "they swim by rotating thin helical filaments called flagella ; each flagellum is driven by a rotary motor powered by the flow of ions ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) across the cytoplasmic membrane . in order to take advantage of chemotactic gradients ,",
    "many of these bacteria have evolved a run - and - tumble swimming strategy  @xcite . in the case of the paradigmatic _ escherichia coli _",
    ", during the run mode the flagella rotate counterclockwise and the microorganism moves in a forward , relatively straight direction , whereas during the tumble mode , one or more flagella rotate clockwise and the bacterium is reoriented in a new direction  @xcite . as shown forty years ago by berg and brown for _ e. coli _  @xcite : ( a ) runs are not strictly straight due to rotational diffusion , ( b ) run lengths are exponentially distributed , and ( c ) bacterial heading changes at tumbles by less than @xmath2 , preserving some memory of the previous run , a fact that is often neglected in theoretical treatments .",
    "it is worth noting that some marine bacteria show anti - persistency , in what is called a run - and - reverse strategy  @xcite .",
    "the case of bacterial directed motion under asymmetrical geometrical confinement , first observed and explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , was modeled phenomenologically in ref .",
    "the authors considered point - like swimming bacteria following run - and - tumble dynamics with a constant motor force magnitude and thermal fluctuations .",
    "although this model neglects the details of the swimmer dynamics , it reproduces the most important experimental findings and has been an inspiration for further theoretical work . in ref .",
    "@xcite the relation between the ratchet effect and symmetry breaking by the funnel array geometry was clarified .",
    "it was shown there that the break of time - reversal symmetry needed for rectification is provided by the forced rotation of bacteria when colliding with a wall , and not by the motor force of bacteria .",
    "this is so because the break of time - reversal symmetry provided by the bacterial motor is lost at a coarse - grained level of diffusion where detailed balance is restored .",
    "later , the influence of the specific dynamical properties , from ( a ) to ( c ) , described by berg and brown , on the accumulation of cells in presence of asymmetric obstacles was studied in detail in ref .",
    "this numerical analysis used experimental values of the motility parameters .",
    "it was found that different swimming strategies may yield very different microorganism accumulation efficiencies , being measured as the device capacity to concentrate cells ( number of concentrated cells / number of inoculated cells of the same type ) .",
    "we summarize the main results of that work :    1 .   in unbounded environments",
    "there are two processes that degrade the orientational correlation : tumbling and rotational diffusion .",
    "the first is much more important for systems with short runs , while rotational diffusion gives the dominant contribution to memory loss in systems characterized by long runs .",
    "these effects can be quantified by the velocity correlation function .",
    "a study of the mean square displacement in unbounded environments reveals that the translational diffusion coefficient @xmath3 decreases strongly as the change - of - heading angle at a tumble increases . unless typical runs are very long , @xmath3 is approximately given by its value in the absence of rotational diffusion .",
    "these results indicate that , to make accurate predictions about swimmer sorting , it is necessary to consider the specific motility properties of the microorganisms involved .",
    "when the dynamics of free swimmers is incorporated into a spatially constrained environment ( asymmetric geometry ) long run lengths and small tumble emergence angles lead to an increased cell density near the walls and , consequently , to fast net displacement in the easy ratchet direction . in general ,",
    "long permanence near the walls and suitable wall - of - funnels architecture , i.e. , funnel walls at least as long as the run length and funnel openings of the order of the cell size , favor rectification or cell concentration .",
    "4 .   increasing the average run duration , @xmath4 ,",
    "increases the time of permanence close to the walls , leading to enhanced rectification .",
    "if @xmath4 is negligible , the swimmers can not take advantage of swimming along the funnel walls and directed motion does not ensue .",
    "increasing the average speed during the run and decreasing the average change - of - heading angle at a tumble , i.e. increasing persistence , enhance wall accumulation and rectification .",
    "good agreement was obtained with available experimental data , specifically regarding the time of rectification and the efficiency of a microfabricated wall of funnel - shaped openings as the one used in ref .",

    "we use the improved phenomenological model introduced by berdakin _ et .",

    "our objective is to help to design good sorters , using a model that incorporates real motility parameters . in section 2",
    "we review the computational model and define the quantities to be calculated , such as the extraction time and the sorting efficiency . in section 3",

    "in our simulations we did not include fluid flow , so that the net bacterial motion from left to right is solely due to funnel asymmetry . under flow our results",
    "would be very different .",

    "we could hypothesize that flow may lower the sorting efficiency when pointing in the easy ratchet direction ( left - right ) and enhance the efficiency otherwise , but this is something that deserves careful study .    in this paper",
    "our goal was to efficiently sort swimmers at low concentrations as experiments in view of how technological applications in this field are generally made .",
    "but what would happen at high concentrations ?",

    "<S> the sorting of two bacterial populations inoculated in a box consisting of a series of chambers separated by columns of asymmetric obstacles is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the sorting efficiency is enhanced by these obstacles and conclude that this kind of sorting can be efficiently used even when the involved populations differ only in one aspect of their swimming strategy . </S>"
