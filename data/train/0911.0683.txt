    "we have considered the typical magnetic ordering of the core spins found in the manganites , viz . , the a , c , g , and f types of magnetic states .",
    "type c was always found to be of higher energy within our model . to accommodate these structures , the unit cell in the lattice consisted of four mn atoms .",
    "the total energy was calculated by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) and adding the energies of the occupied states in the brillouin zone , corresponding to one @xmath15 electron per mn atom , for the various strain conditions and magnetic configurations .",

    "as we deviate from the center , jt - splitting reduces the effect of the hopping due to the energy denominator , which therefore weakens the fm stability .    for the type a afm ordering , the @xmath103 orbital hopping is forbidden along the c - axis .",

[ contour ] ( top right ) ) which is close to earlier experimental and theoretical studies@xcite .",

    "the curves are parabolas with shifted minima for the g and g@xmath4 structures , where the expression ( [ parabola ] ) is exact , since there is no hopping for these structures . for the remaining structures , there is a gain of energy due to hopping , being maximum for the ferromagnetic f structure , where hopping is allowed in all directions in the lattice .",

    "another point regarding the total energy of fig .",
    "[ totalenergy ] is that the ferromagnetic phase is always close by in energy for small strain situations , which is suggestive of the reason why lmo thin films are usually observed to occur in the ferromagnetic phase , rather than the a phase of the bulk .    finally , one might ask how is it possible that at larger strains the nel ordered g or g@xmath4 state wins over the ferromagnetic f state .",

    "<S> our results show the ground state to be a type a antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulating state for the unstrained case , consistent with experiments . with tensile strain ( stretching along the c axis ) , the ground state changes into a ferromagnetic and eventually into a type g@xmath4 afm structure , while with compressive strain , we find the type a switching into a type g structure . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital ordering , which displays the well known checkerboard @xmath5 structure for the unstrained case , retains more or less the same character for compressive strain , while changing into the @xmath6 character for tensile strains . while @xmath7 and @xmath2 are fixed by the strain components @xmath8 and @xmath9 in our model , the magnitude of the in - plane distortion mode ( q@xmath10 ) , which varies to minimize the total energy , slowly diminishes with tensile strain , completely disappearing as the fm state is entered . within our model , </S>",
    "<S> the fm state is metallic , while the three afm states are insulating . </S>"
