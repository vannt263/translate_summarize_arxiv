    "the theory of topological persistence @xcite has become popular in topological data analysis ( tda ) @xcite .",
    "given an input data such as a point cloud or a sequence of topological spaces , persistence modules capture topological features of the input and the robustness of those features .",
    "one of the important algebraic frameworks that makes the theory of topological persistence more useful is to deal with persistence modules as representations on @xmath0 quivers @xcite . in this framework",
    ", the representation - finite property of @xmath0 quivers allows us to measure topological features in a compact format called a persistence diagram and to realize efficient computations @xcite for practical applications .    on the other hand",
    ", there are several important problems to be solved in tda to which persistence modules on @xmath0 quivers can not be applied .",
    "for example , we often need to compare two input data and capture robust _ and _ common topological features between them . by restricting our attention to only robust _ or _ common topological features , persistence modules on @xmath0 quivers",
    "can solve the restricted problems .",
    "however , we can not directly apply this method for studying both properties simultaneously .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the theory of topological persistence to persistence modules on commutative ladders .",
    "this extension provides us with a tool to solve the above problem , as an example . a new algebraic framework we propose in this paper deals with persistence modules as representations on quivers with relations ( i.e. , associative algebras ) and applies a powerful tool in representation theory called the auslander - reiten theory . by this tool",
    ", we can study the representation - finite property of commutative ladders and obtain a natural generalization of persistence diagrams .",
    "furthermore , the auslander - reiten theory also provides us with algorithms for computing generalized persistence diagrams .",
    "this work is motivated by recent results in the theory of topological persistence and applications in tda . on the theoretical side",
    ", this work is strongly inspired by the paper @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "carlsson and de silva explain persistence modules as representations of @xmath0 quivers and generalize to zigzag persistence modules . by this connection to the representation theory ,",
    "algebraic aspects of persistence modules have been understood further and have led to several generalizations @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with an extension to representations on associative algebras .    on the side of applications ,",
    "our motivation arises from tda on materials science @xcite and protein structural analysis @xcite . in both studies , atomic arrangements in molecules such as glasses and proteins",
    "are the input data , and the authors study topological characterizations of some physical properties of those molecules by using standard persistence modules of the weighted alpha complex filtrations @xcite of the input .",
    "let us explain the tda studied in @xcite in more detail to clarify the motivation of this work .",
    "the authors study geometric structures of rings in glasses .",
    "the left part of figure [ fig : pd_glass ] shows the persistence diagram in dimension one of an @xmath1 glass with an atomic arrangement @xmath2 , where the multiplicities of the generators are measured in double logarithmic scale .",
    "one of the important results in @xcite is that there are correlations between the generators in the blue square and the rigidity of glasses under small deformations of atomic arrangements . after seeing this physical correspondence ,",
    "it is natural to ask how these generators actually persist under physical pressurization .",
    "the right part of figure [ fig : pd_glass ] shows the persistence diagram in dimension one of an atomic arrangement @xmath3 obtained by adding pressure to the original @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that the similarity of these diagrams , which can be measured by using bottleneck distance , is not sufficient to verify that these generators actually persist under pressurization . in order to precisely answer the above question",
    ", we have to directly study generators in the blue regions which are shared between the left and right .     of a glass , whereas the atomic arrangement @xmath3 for the right is obtained by adding isotropic pressure to @xmath2 .",
    "the multiplicities are measured in double logarithmic scale .",
    "the weighted alpha complexes are constructed by the software cgal @xcite . for more details , see @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   of a glass , whereas the atomic arrangement @xmath3 for the right is obtained by adding isotropic pressure to @xmath2 .",
    "the multiplicities are measured in double logarithmic scale .",
    "the weighted alpha complexes are constructed by the software cgal @xcite . for more details , see @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]      from these motivations , we treat quivers of the form @xmath15 in this paper , where @xmath16 expresses either @xmath17 or @xmath18 , and the orientations of the arrows in the upper sequence are the same as those in the lower sequence .",
    "we call this type of quiver a commutative ladder of length @xmath19 .",
    "the adjective  commutative \" means that any two directed paths with the same start and end vertices are identified .",
    "then , we define persistence modules on commutative ladders by representations on them ( precise definitions of these concepts are given in section [ sec : preliminaries ] ) .",
    "our primary interest is to extend the theory of topological persistence to this class of quivers .",
    "the commutative diagram ( [ eq : pm_glass ] ) is thus an example of a persistence module on a commutative ladder of length three .",
    "our approach treats persistence modules as representations on quivers with nontrivial relations and applies the auslander - reiten theory for studying this extension .",
    "here we summarize the essence of this new framework .",
    "a detailed account is given in section [ sec : preliminaries ] and section [ section : pm_clq ] .",
    "in the paper @xcite , the authors study zigzag persistence modules as representations on quivers , where gabriel s theorem @xcite plays a key role .",
    "this theorem provides a complete characterization of quivers that have only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposables .",
    "a quiver with this property is called representation - finite , and the class of @xmath0 quivers @xmath20 is shown to be one of the classes of quivers with this property .",
    "then , zigzag persistence modules can be formulated as representations on @xmath0 quivers , and all the isomorphism classes of indecomposables are given by interval representations , which we usually call barcodes @xcite in tda .    on the other hand , the quivers ( [ eq : cl ] ) of interest in this paper",
    "possess the commutativity relations .",
    "note that gabriel s theorem does not treat quivers with such nontrivial relations .",
    "hence , it is still possible for our quivers to be representation - finite even though they are not one of the classes in gabriel s theorem , and we may develop a similar theory of topological persistence on these quivers .    for the study of representations on quivers with relations such as commutativity , the auslander - reiten theory plays an important role .",
    "in particular , for each quiver with relations , its auslander - reiten quiver captures all the isomorphism classes of indecomposables by a set of vertices and describes relationships among them by a set of arrows .",
    "our approach explicitly constructs the auslander - reiten quivers of ( [ eq : cl ] ) that are representation - finite .",
    "furthermore , we show that the auslander - reiten quivers give a natural generalization of persistence diagrams .",
    "we believe that these new theoretical concepts and tools shed new light on the theory of topological persistence . in this paper , we explain only specific portions of the auslander - reiten theory that are necessary to derive our main results in order for this paper to be self - contained . for a complete treatment of the auslander - reiten theory ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "our contributions in this paper are as follows :    a.   we prove that the commutative ladders ( [ eq : cl ] ) of length @xmath21 are representation - finite ( theorem [ theorem : cl ] ) .",
    "furthermore , their auslander - reiten quivers are explicitly shown in figures [ fig : ar_f ] to [ fig : ar_bbf ] .",

    "b.   we generalize the concept of persistence diagrams to functions on the vertex set of an auslander - reiten quiver .",
    "c.   we present an algorithm for computing these generalized persistence diagrams by using the structure of auslander - reiten quivers .",
    "d.   finally , we show numerical examples including our original motivation from the tda on glasses .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ]",
    ", we briefly explain the results of @xcite in our framework of representations on associative algebras .",

    "our main theorem about the representation - finite property of the commutative ladders of length @xmath21 is stated in section [ section : clq ] . to prove this theorem",

    "we also construct the auslander - reiten quiver for conventional persistence modules in section [ sec : ar_an ] in order to compare this new framework with the existing one .",
    "this comparison also leads to a natural generalization of persistence diagrams , which we present in section [ sec : generalization_pd ] . in section [ sec : arq_clfb ] , we give some interpretations of the auslander - reiten quivers from the viewpoint of tda by focusing on our original example ( [ eq : pm_glass ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : algorithm ] is devoted to presenting an algorithm for computing persistence diagrams .",
    "our algorithm computes persistence diagrams by inductively applying echelon form reductions to a given persistence module on commutative ladders of finite type . in particular",
