    "consider the stochastic delay differential equation ( sdde ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are wiener processes .",
    "the above equation represents a noisy perturbation of the following deterministic system : @xmath3 the linear system corresponding to is @xmath4 seeking a solution of the form @xmath5 to the linear system , we find that @xmath6 must satisfy the characteristic equation @xmath7 . when @xmath8 , all roots of the characteristic equation have negative real parts ( see corollary 3.3 on page 53 of @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath9 a pair of roots @xmath10 are on the imaginary axis and all other roots have negative real parts . when @xmath11 some of the roots have positive real part .",
    "hence , the system is on the verge of instability at @xmath9 .",
    "close to the verge of instability , the behaviour of the solution is oscillatory with amplitude increasing or decreasing depending on whether the root with the largest real part has positive real part or negative .    to study close to the verge of instability , set @xmath12 and zoom - in near @xmath13 , i.e. write @xmath14 for @xmath15 governed by .",
    "we get @xmath16 the equations studied in this paper are of the above kind . before stating the equations in more precise terms below , we describe briefly the motivation for studying such equations .",
    "delay equations at the verge of instability arise , for example , in machining processes @xcite , in the response of eye - pupil to incident light @xcite , in human balancing @xcite . in machining processes ,",
    "the motion of the cutting tool can be described by a dde  the tool cuts a work - piece placed on a rotating shaft and the delay is the time - period of the rotating shaft . for each rotation period",
    "there is certain rate of cutting below which the tool is stable and above which the tool breaks .",
    "the inhomogenities in the properties of the material being cut can be modeled by noise ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the eye - pupil exhibits oscillations in response to incident light ",
    "however there is some delay in the response because neurons have finite processing speed .",
    "this phenomenon can be modeled using a dde at the verge of instability @xcite .",
    "so , a study of the effect of noise perturbations on ` dde at the verge of instability ' is indeed useful .",
    "let @xmath17 be an @xmath18-valued process governed by an sdde .",
    "let @xmath19 be the maximum of the delays involved in the drift and diffusion coefficients of the sdde . to find the evolution at time @xmath20 of the process , we need to keep track of @xmath21 for @xmath22 . for this purpose ,",

    "of course , as an initial condition we specify @xmath34 .",
    "[ ass : assumptondetsys ] we assume that the corresponding unperturbed dde @xmath40 is critical , i.e. a pair of roots ( @xmath41 ) of the characteristic equation @xmath42 are on the imaginary axis ( critical eigenvalues ) and all other roots have negative real parts ( stable eigenvalues ) .    roughly speaking , under the above assumption , the solution of the unperturbed system is oscillatory with constant amplitude .",
    "however for the perturbed system , it can be shown that for the amplitude of oscillation of @xmath43 to change considerably , we need to wait for a time of order @xmath44 .",
    "hence we change the time scale , i.e. define @xmath45 .    to be able to put the rescaled process @xmath46 in a form akin to we need to define the _ rescaled segment extractor _",

    "it was shown that the distribution of @xmath61 converges weakly to the distribution of a process @xmath63 governed by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) _ without delay_. for small @xmath64 , this @xmath63 gives good approximation for the dynamics of @xmath62 .",
    "the advantage is three fold : ( i ) equations without delay are easier to analyze , ( ii ) for numerical simulations , @xmath62 requires storage of @xmath65 ( the entire segment ) whereas @xmath63 requires just the storage of current value @xmath66 , ( iii ) numerical simulation of @xmath62 requires very small time - step for integration because the drift coefficient is of the order @xmath44 , whereas @xmath63 does not require such a small time - step .    in this article",
    "we relax the lipschitz assumption on the coefficient @xmath60 for the additive noise case .",
    "note that the presence of @xmath67 in makes @xmath60 non - lipschitz .",
    "the process @xmath61 mentioned above encodes information only about the critical eigenspace ( space spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the imaginary roots of the characteristic equation ) , and to obtain the convergence to @xmath63 one needs to show that the projection of @xmath62 onto stable eigenspace is small ( details would be provided later ) . in @xcite",
    "this was easy to show because of the lipschitz condition on @xmath60 . in this article",
    "we need to follow a different approach .",
    "the case of multiplicative noise is also considered here . however , for the multiplicative noise case the lipschitz condition could not be relaxed .",
    "the presence of cubic nonlinearites causes the following problem : in trying to estimate a moment of certain order we encounter terms with higher order moments .",
    "@xcite discusses the approaches in the literature towards sdde at the verge of instability and shows the mistakes and shortcomings of those approaches ( see section 1 and appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , here we refrain from mentioning these works again .",
