    "models possessing global and/or local discrete @xmath0 symmetry play an important role in many branches of physics ranging from the solid state physics to the description of the universality features of the deconfining transition in @xmath25 gauge theories . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) at zero temperature . assigning the gauge fields @xmath26 to the links of a simple hypercubic lattice ,",
    "the most general action of the isotropic @xmath0 lgt can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , denotes the unit vector in the @xmath30-th direction .",
    "similarly , the most general action of the @xmath0 spin model is given by @xmath31 in both cases we used the convention @xmath32 the standard potts model corresponds to the choice when all @xmath33 are equal .",
    "then , the sum over @xmath34 reduces to a delta - function on the @xmath0 group .",
    "the conventional vector model corresponds to @xmath35 for all @xmath36 . for @xmath37",
    "the potts and vector models are equivalent .    two - dimensional ( 2d )",
    "standard and vector @xmath0 lgts are exactly solvable both in the finite volume and in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "they exhibit no phase transition at any finite value of the coupling constant @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , the rectangular @xmath39 wilson loop in the representation @xmath34 obeys the area law @xmath40 thus implying a permanent confinement of static charges .",
    "for example , the string tension of the vector model in the thermodynamic limit reads @xmath41 \\",
    ">   0 \\ \\ , \\ \\",
    "c_k(n,\\beta ) \\ = \\",
    "\\sum_{r=-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\",
    "i_{nr+k}(\\beta ) \\ .   % \\label{2d_sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath42 is the modified bessel function",
    ".    no exact solution has been found for any @xmath0 model in @xmath9 , where the phase structure becomes highly non - trivial .",
    "while the phase structure of the general model defined by  ( [ action_gauge ] ) remains unknown , it is well established that potts models and vector models with only @xmath43 non - vanishing have one phase transition from a confining phase to a phase with vanishing string tension  @xcite . via duality ,",
    "@xmath0 gauge models can be exactly related to @xmath9 @xmath0 spin models . in particular",
    ", a potts gauge theory is mapped to a potts spin model , and such a relation allows to establish the order of the phase transition .",
    "hence , potts lgts with @xmath44 have second order phase transition , while for @xmath45 one finds a first order phase transition .",
    "since @xmath46 lgt is equivalent to the ising model , its critical behavior is well known ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "generally , the @xmath0 global symmetry of the finite - temperature @xmath47 @xmath25 gauge theory motivated thorough investigations , both analytical and numerical , of the @xmath9 spin models , especially for @xmath37  @xcite ( for more recent studies , see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath9 potts models for @xmath48 have been simulated in  @xcite and studied by means of the high - temperature expansion in  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , much less is known about the critical behavior of @xmath0 vector lgts when @xmath5 .",
    "they have been studied numerically in  @xcite up to @xmath49 on symmetric lattices with size @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "it was confirmed that zero - temperature models possess a single phase transition which disappears in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "a scaling formula proposed in  @xcite shows that the critical coupling diverges like @xmath52 for large @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the @xmath53 lgt has a single confined phase in agreement with theoretical results  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware , however , of any detailed study of the critical behavior of the vector models with @xmath54 in the vicinity of this single phase transition .",
    "slightly more is known about the critical properties of @xmath0 vector spin models . in particular",
    ", it has been suggested that all vector spin models exhibit a single second order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "an especially detailed study was performed on the @xmath55 model , because the @xmath55 global symmetry appears as an effective symmetry of the @xmath56 antiferromagnetic potts model  @xcite .",
    "the computed critical indices suggest that the @xmath55 vector model belongs to the universality class of the @xmath9 @xmath6 model .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath55 model and , possibly , of all vector models with @xmath5 , is the appearance of an intermediate rotationally symmetric region below the critical temperature of the second order phase transition .",
    "the mass gap was however found to be rather small , but non - vanishing in this region  @xcite .",
    "combined with a renormalization group ( rg ) study , the analysis concluded that this intermediate region presents a crossover to a low - temperature massive phase , where the discreteness of @xmath55 plays an essential role  @xcite .    the main goal of the present work is to fill the gap in our knowledge about the critical behavior of the @xmath9 @xmath0 lgts .",
    "another motivation comes from our recent studies of the deconfinement transition in the @xmath0 vector lgt for @xmath5 at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the major findings of these papers was the demonstration of two phase transitions of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type and the existence of an intermediate massless phase .",
    "the critical indices at these transitions have been found to coincide with the indices of the @xmath57 vector spin models .",
    "an interesting question then arises regarding the construction of the continuum limit of the finite - temperature models in the vicinity of the critical points . for this to accomplish it might be useful , and even necessary , to know the scaling of quantities such as string tension , correlation length , _ etc .",
    "_ near the critical points of the corresponding zero temperature models .    in this work we are going to",
    ":    * perform an analytical study of the general @xmath9 @xmath0 lgt for various @xmath1 using a `` phenomenological '' rg ; * locate critical points of the vector models via monte carlo simulations of the dual of the @xmath0 lgt and determine their scaling with @xmath1 ; * compute some critical indices and establish the universality class of the models ; * illustrate the existence of a rotationally symmetric region within the ordered phase for all @xmath8 at least in the finite volume .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we formulate our model and recall the exact duality relation with a generalized @xmath9 @xmath0 spin model .",

    ", we explore the space of coupling constants , find fixed points and calculate the critical index @xmath58 . in section  4",
    "we present the setup of monte carlo simulations , define the observables used in this work and present the numerical results .",
    "in particular , we locate the position of critical points and compute various critical indices at these points . as a cross - check , we also simulated @xmath59 models for which high - precision results .",
    "the same section deals also with the computation of the average action and the heat capacity in the vicinity of critical points and the derivation of the index @xmath7 from a finite size scaling ( fss ) analysis of the heat capacity . in section  5",
    "we discuss some findings regarding the symmetric region below the critical point .",

    ", it is somewhat more convenient to use a different but equivalent representation for the boltzmann weight , namely @xmath74 \\ = \\ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1 } \\ t_k \\",

    "the dual of the partition function ( [ ptdef ] ) can then be presented as @xmath78 here , the summations over @xmath79 , enforce the global bianchi constraints due to the periodic bc and @xmath80 on a set of links dual to any fixed closed surface wrapping the original lattice in the directions perpendicular to @xmath30 , otherwise @xmath81 .",
    "as a first step we consider the general @xmath9 @xmath0 lgt with the boltzmann weight ( [ bweight1 ] ) and study its phase structure with the help of the phenomenological renormalization group ( ph rg )  @xcite . for the @xmath9 ising model",
    "this rg was used in  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the ph rg gives in many cases not only the qualitatively correct phase diagram of a model , but also a good quantitative approximation for the observables near the critical points , and this approximation can be systematically improved .",
    "we follow the general strategy described in the original papers  @xcite and only briefly outline our modifications ( for a detailed account of these modifications , together with application to other models , see  @xcite ) . as is common for this type of rg , we preserve the mass gap during the rg steps .",
    "we proceed as follows .    1 .",

    "this set of equations is treated as the recursion relations for the renormalized coupling constants .",
    "the summation over the spins lying in one plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction introduces all possible interactions between the remaining spins .",
    "the transfer matrix is constructed for the evolution of all independent couplings of this general interaction .",
    "this substantially reduces the size of the matrix .",
    "5 .   combining the ph rg in the form described above with the cluster decimation approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can construct new partition and correlation functions on a decimated lattice with double lattice spacing .",
    "the next iteration is performed with newly computed constants @xmath87 .    in the framework of this approach",
    "we have explored the phase structure of the generalized @xmath0 model . only in the case of the standard potts model",
    "we can restrict ourselves to one iteration , since the rg steps do not generate new interactions .",
    "for the general case one should perform many iterations to locate precisely the critical points .",

    "has been known for a long time  @xcite . here",
    "we confirm its existence for all vector @xmath92 lgts .",
    "the phase exhibits itself , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the behavior of magnetization . as an example",
    ", we give in fig  [ scatter_plots ] the scatter plots of magnetization and rotated magnetization , together with the histogram of the magnetization angle for @xmath55 on a @xmath89 lattice .",
    "one sees that below the critical coupling at @xmath91 the symmetry is not broken on this lattice . only starting from approximately @xmath90 one",
    "can observe the appearance of a symmetry - broken phase .",
    "in addition , we have studied the behavior of the population susceptibility below @xmath93 .",
    "fig  [ chipplot ] shows that it has a second broad maximum , which slowly moves to @xmath93 with increasing lattice size .",
    "a similar picture is observed for all @xmath8 .",
    "while , however , for @xmath94 the peak of the population susceptibility moves rather fast and practically collapses with the peak at the critical coupling on the largest available lattice @xmath4 , for larger @xmath1 the peak stays rather far from the corresponding critical coupling , even for @xmath4 ( with our data we can not even exclude a situation when the convergence of the second maximum is logarithmic ) .",
    "we can imagine two scenarios to explain such behavior :    1 .",
    "this symmetric phase exists only in finite volume .",
    "when the lattice size increases , the second maximum approaches the critical coupling and , eventually , the symmetric region shrinks and disappears .",
    "the explanation proposed in  @xcite might work in this case , too .",
    "namely , the symmetric phase on the finite lattice is a phase with a very small mass gap and describes a crossover region to the symmetry - broken phase .",
    "2 .   for @xmath95",
    "the second maximum of the population susceptibility stays away from the critical couplings even in the infinite volume limit . in this case",
    "it might correspond to some higher order phase transition and the symmetric phase with tiny or even vanishing mass gap exists also in the thermodynamic limit .    in both cases",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this symmetric region is reminiscent of the massless phase which appears in these models at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "whichever scenario of the above two is realized , one needs to study the models on much larger lattices to uncover it .",
    "in this paper we have studied the @xmath9 @xmath0 lgt at zero temperature aiming at shedding light on the nature of phase transitions in these models for @xmath54 .",
    "this study was based on the exact duality transformations of the gauge models to generalized @xmath9 @xmath0 spin models . in section  2",
    "we presented an overview of the exact relation between couplings of these two models . in section  3",
    "we have studied the models analytically using a version of the phenomenological rg based on the preservation of the mass gap combined with a cluster decimation approximation .",
    "this study provided us with an approximate location of the critical couplings as well as with the value of the index @xmath58 .",
    "these calculations show that the index @xmath58 is approximately the same for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , indicating that these two models might belong to the same universality class .",
    "we find @xmath98 and approximately equal for @xmath5 .",
    "hence , @xmath99 vector lgts belong to a different universality class .",
    "the numerical part of the work has been devoted to the localization of the critical couplings , computation of the various critical indices and check of the hyperscaling relation .",
    "the main results can be shortly summarized as follows :    * we have determined numerically the position of the critical couplings for various @xmath0 models . for @xmath37",
    "we find a reasonable agreement with the values quoted in the literature . for larger @xmath1",
    ", we have significantly improved the values given in  @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to improve the scaling formula for the critical couplings with @xmath1 . *",
    "the critical indices @xmath58 and @xmath100 derived here for @xmath96 suggest that these models are in the universality class of the @xmath9 ising model , while our results for all @xmath5 hint all vector @xmath92 lgts belong to the universality class of the @xmath9 @xmath6 model .",
    "this is especially evident from the value of the index @xmath58 , which stays very close to the @xmath6 value , @xmath101 , given in  @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath7 in this case takes a small negative value .",
    "it thus follows that a third order phase transition takes place for @xmath8 .",
    "* a careful investigation of the specific heat and of the index @xmath7 extracted from it suggests however a more complicated picture of the critical behavior . in this case",
    "we find a value which roughly agrees with the value of @xmath9 ising model for all @xmath1 studied .",
    "the fact that we observe two different values of the index @xmath7 dependently on whether we approach the critical point from below or from above leads to the conclusion that the first derivative of the free energy could exhibit a cusp in the thermodynamic limit if @xmath5 .",
    "* our data also revealed the existence of a symmetric phase for all @xmath0 vector lgts if @xmath5 .",
    "however , substantially larger lattices are required to see if this phase survives the transition to the thermodynamic limit .",
