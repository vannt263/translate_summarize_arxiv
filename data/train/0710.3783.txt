    "the key to this experiment is the short 5 ns , 160 mj pulses of 532 nm light emitted with a repetition rate of 20 hz by our light source , a frequency - doubled continuum surelite i-20 nd : yag laser . as described below , the small duty cycle enables a large reduction in the detector noise via coincidence counting .",
    "the laser light is vertically polarized and when needed , a halfwave plate is used to obtain horizontal polarization .",
    "the laser pulses are sent through a vacuum system ( diagrammed in fig .  [",
    "f : apparatus ] ) designed around an insulating warm bore inserted into a 6 m tevatron superconducting dipole magnet .",
    "the magnet produces a 5 t vertical field uniform across the aperture of the @xmath8 inner diameter warm bore .",
    "a `` wall '' consisting of a high - power laser mirror on the end of a long ( 7 m ) hollow stainless steel `` plunger '' is inserted into the warm bore .",
    "the mirror may be placed at various positions within the magnet by sliding the plunger .",
    "the plunger mirror projects the reflected wave into a photon state and the transmitted wave into a ( pseudo-)scalar state , provided that the scalar is sufficiently weakly - interacting to pass through the material of the mirror .",
    "the mirror also functions to reflect the incident laser power out of the magnet to prevent heating of the magnet coils .",
    "the mirror is mounted on a welded stainless steel cap on the end of the plunger in order to prevent stray photons from passing through .",
    "thus , the beam passing through the end of the plunger is a pure scalar beam .",
    "these scalars can then oscillate back into photons through the remaining magnetic field region inside the @xmath9 inner diameter hollow plunger .",
    "upon exiting the magnetic field region , the interaction ceases and the photon - scalar wavefunction is frozen .",
    "this combined wavefunction then propagates @xmath10 into a dark box where a hamamatsu h7422p-40 photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) module is used to detect single photons in coincidence with the laser pulses .",
    "as described below , a high signal to noise ratio is achieved due to the very short pulses emitted by the laser .",
    "the photon - scalar transition probability may be written in convenient units as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the strength of the external magnetic field , @xmath13 is the inital photon energy , @xmath14 is the magnetic oscillation baseline . the mass - squared difference between the scalar mass and the effective photon mass , @xmath15 , characterizes the mismatch of the phase velocities of the photon wave and the massive scalar wave and determines the characteristic oscillation length .",
    "while the photon does not really gain a mass in a normal dielectric medium , the phase advance may be modelled with an effective imaginary mass @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the index of refraction @xcite .",
    "both the warm bore and the interior of the plunger are pumped to moderate vacuum pressures of less than @xmath18 , and a conservative estimate gives @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , starting with eqn .",
    "[ e : conversionprob2 ] we assume that the contribution from the effective photon mass is negligible for larger values of @xmath20 near the pvlas region .    as can be seen from eqn .",
    "[ e : conversionprob3 ] , the meter scale baseline provided by typical accelerator magnets is well - suited for probing the milli - ev range of possible particle masses .",
    "this fact can be a curse as well as a boon because for a monochromatic laser beam , a fixed magnet length may accidentally coincide with a minimum in the oscillation rather than a maximum .",
    "indeed , this is a possible reason why the bfrt experiment @xcite did not see the pvlas signal even though they had similar sensitivity .",
    "gammev s plunger design allows us to change the oscillation baseline and thus scan through all possible values of the scalar mass in the milli - ev range without any regions of diminished sensitivity . the total conversion and",
    "regeneration probability contains two factors of eqn .",
    "[ e : conversionprob2 ] , corresponding to the pre - mirror and post - mirror magnetic field regions of lengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the initial vacuum chamber consists of a 10 m insulating warm bore which is offset by 1.6 m from the end of the 6 m magnetic field region , and is sealed to the sliding plunger via a double o - ring assembly .",
    "the sliding plunger has a range of motion of 1.9 m , and contains an independent vacuum chamber .",
    "the vacuum window at the far end slides within a stationary , long dark box.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to detect regenerated photons we use a @xmath25 diameter lens to focus the beam onto the @xmath26 diameter gaasp photocathode of the pmt .",
    "the alignment is performed using a low power green helium - neon alignment laser and a mock target .",
    "the alignment is verified both before and after each data - taking period by replacing the sealed plunger with an open - ended plunger , re - establishing the vacuum , and firing the nd : yag laser onto a flash paper target .",
    "an optical transport efficiency of @xmath27 is measured using the ratio of laser power transmitted through the open - ended plunger and through the various optics and vacuum windows , to the initial laser power , using the same power meter in both cases to remove systematic effects .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the photocathode is factory - measured to be @xmath28 while the collection efficiency of the metal package pmt is estimated to be @xmath29 .",
    "the pmt pulses are amplified by 46 db and then sent into a nim discriminator . using a highly attenuated led flasher as a single photon source ,",
    "the discriminator threshold is optimized to give 99.4@xmath30 efficiency for triggering on single photo - electron pulses while also efficiently rejecting the lower amplitude noise . by studying the trigger time distribution , the deadtime fraction due to possible multiple rapid pmt pulses",
    "is found to be negligible ( 0.001@xmath30 ) .",
    "thus , we estimate the total photon transport and counting efficiency to be @xmath31 . using this threshold , and the built - in cooler to cool the photocathode to @xmath32c , we measure a typical dark count rate of 130 hz .",
    "pmt trigger times for the four run configurations , shown relative to the expected time distribution of photons as calibrated from the leaky mirror data.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to perform the coincidence counting we use two quarknet boards @xcite @xcite with 1.25 ns timing precision , referenced to a gps clock .",
    "the quarknet boards determine the absolute time of the leading edge of time - over - threshold triggers from the pmt and from a monitoring photodiode that is located inside the laser box .",
    "the clocks on the laser board and on the pmt board are synchronized using an external trigger from a signal generator .",
    "the absolute timing between the laser pulses and the pmt traces is established by removing the plunger with the mirror , and allowing the laser to shine on the pmt through several attenuation stages consisting of two partially reflective ( `` leaky '' ) mirrors , a pinhole , and multiple absorptive filters mounted directly on the aperture of the pmt module .",
    "the @xmath33 photons per second emitted by the laser are thus attenuated to a corresponding pmt trigger rate of less than 0.1 hz for this timing calibration and to provide an _ in situ _ test of the data acquisition system .",
    "the regenerated photons should arrive at the same time as the straight - through photons since milli - ev particles are also highly relativistic . for coincidence counting between the laser pulses and the pmt ,",
    "a 10 ns wide window is chosen and includes @xmath34 of the measured photon time distribution shown in fig .",

    "data are taken separately with both vertically and horizontally polarized laser light in order to test pseudoscalar and scalar couplings , respectively .",
    "the central plunger position covers most of the pvlas signal region but the corresponding oscillation probability goes to zero in eqn .  [ e : conversionprob3 ] at @xmath42 where the argument of the each of the sine factors approaches @xmath43 .",
    "these zeroes indicate regions of diminished sensitivity as the scalars have oscillated back into photons upon reaching the plunger mirror . moving the plunger to the far position",
    "simultaneously changes the baseline for both the initial oscillation and the regeneration , and shifts the two regions of diminished sensitivity away from @xmath44 .",

    "the alignment of the laser is monitored using a fast solid state camera which takes 30 hz of images of the reflected laser spot on the pick - off mirror .",
    "the total pathlength to the pick - off mirror is comparable to the pathlength to the pmt , and so transverse deviations seen in the images are closely matched to the deviations at the pmt .",
    "small @xmath46 mm scale transverse deviations are seen during the course of a typical 5 hour run , due to small changes in the orientation of the plunger mirror as the plunger slowly cools through heat leaks in the warm bore insulation .",
    "the deviations are small enough that , were they due to actual changes in the laser alignment , the beam would still clear the aperture of the plunger .",
    "in addition , the focussing lens at the pmt makes the final light collection system insensitive to these potential sub - mrad angular deviations .",
