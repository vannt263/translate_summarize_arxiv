    "<S> the low - energy elementary excitations of graphene are known to be massless dirac fermions with linear dispersion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when dirac fermions are strictly massless , the system has a semimetal ground state and its hamiltonian possesses a continuous chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong , the massless fermion ( particle ) may combine with an anti - fermion ( hole ) to form a stable excitonic pair @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the dirac fermion acquires a finite mass gap , which dynamically breaks the chiral symmetry , and the system undergoes a semimetal - insulator transition . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , this excitonic transition has been investigated by several tools , including dyson - schwinger gap equation @xcite , monte carlo simulation @xcite , and renormalization group @xcite . in most of these research works , it was found that such transition can take place when coulomb interaction strength parameter @xmath1 is larger than certain critical value @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the opening of fermion gap can result in important changes in the low - energy properties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , there is still no compelling experimental evidence for the existence of excitonic insulating transition in graphene . in general </S>",
    "<S> , there are three possible reasons why the excitonic transition has not yet been unambiguously observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> first , the coulomb interaction may be too weak to induce excitonic pair formation . </S>",
    "<S> second , the coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong in certain graphene materials , but the excitonic transition is suppressed by various fluctuations and perturbations . actually , we have recently examined this possibility and showed @xcite that even for sufficiently strong coulomb interaction the excitonic transition can be destroyed by thermal fluctuations , finite doping , disorder scattering , and finite lattice effect . </S>",
    "<S> third , the excitonic transition does happen in some graphene , but the fermion gap is too small in magnitude to be clearly resolved by any experimental instruments . at present , it is not possible to judge what exactly the reason is . in order to examine the third possibility , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to determine the magnitude of fermion gap precisely .    </S>",
    "<S> most previous research efforts focused on an accurate determination of the critical point @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , an accurate determination of dynamical fermion gap should be equally important . as discussed above , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted excitonic insulator is experimentally detectable only when the fermion gap is sufficiently large . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the graphene with a large gap will have many technological advantages @xcite . as emphasized by castro neto @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> if the fermion gap is too small , the interests of excitonic insulating transition would be purely academic . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an exact determination of the dynamical fermion gap is very important both experimentally and technologically .    in most previous gap equation analysis of the excitonic transition , the vacuum polarization function appearing in the coulomb interaction function was calculated using the free propagator of massless dirac fermion , which amounts to assuming the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the feedback effect of the dynamical fermion gap on the coulomb interaction was simply ignored . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of such feedback effect can be seen by making a simple qualitative analysis . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in previous works @xcite , the screening of coulomb interaction due to the collective particle - hole excitations can have very important influence on the excitonic transition because it reduces the effective interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> technically , the screening of coulomb interaction is described by the polarization function @xmath3 . at the level of rpa , @xmath4 , so the coulomb interaction is weakened due to dynamical screening . </S>",
    "<S> once a finite fermion gap @xmath5 is included in the polarization function , we have @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this term is much smaller than the term @xmath7 in the low momentum regime , so the effective coulomb interaction becomes much stronger . from this qualitative analysis , we know that the feedback effect of the dynamical fermion gap may play an important role in the gap equation analysis of the excitonic transition .    in order to compute the dynamical fermion gap more accurately , it is crucial to study the equations of fermion gap and polarization function in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism corresponds to the eliashberg theory @xcite , which was originally developed to describe the unusual properties of conventional superconductors with strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from its remarkable success in studying electron - phonon interaction induced superconductors @xcite , the eliashberg theory is also useful in many other condensed matter problems . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it is widely adopted when studying the non - fermi liquid behaviors in some correlated electron systems with singular fermion - boson interactions @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the eliashberg theory of the excitonic gap generation in graphene . to make a general analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we include both finite temperature and finite chemical potential . after solving the self - consistent equations of fermion gap function and polarization function </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the critical point does not change , which is reasonable because bifurcation theory ensures that the fermion gap can be safely taken to be zero near the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> however , the size of dynamical fermion gap is significantly enhanced compared to that obtained using the rpa polarization function . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the self - consistent eliashberg theory plays a crucial role in an accurate computation of dynamical fermion gap . </S>",
    "<S> the eliashberg theory is justified only when the vertex corrections are unimportant . within the @xmath8 expansion , we show that the vertex corrections are suppressed in the large @xmath0 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for interacting dirac fermions is @xmath9 as usual , we adopt the four - component spinor field @xmath10 to describe dirac fermion and define the conjugate spinor field as @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 @xmath13-matrices satisfy the clifford algebra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical flavor of dirac fermion is @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the total hamiltonian possesses a continuous chiral symmetry @xmath15 , where @xmath16 anticommutes with @xmath17 , which will be dynamically broken once a nonzero fermion gap is generated .    </S>",
    "<S> the free propagator for massless dirac fermion is @xmath18 . after including the interaction effect , it is modified to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the wave function renormalization and @xmath21 is the fermion gap function . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities can in principle be obtained by solving the following complete dyson - schwinger equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vertex function and @xmath24 is the coulomb interaction function . </S>",
    "<S> the bare coulomb interaction is @xmath25 , which is clearly long - ranged . after taking into account dynamical screening effect from collective particle - hole excitations , </S>",
    "<S> the effective coulomb interaction function is modified to @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the vacuum polarization function . </S>",
    "<S> the above gap equation has been studied extensively in recent years and dynamical gap generation was found when coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong @xcite . in most of these treatments , </S>",
    "<S> only the leading order of @xmath8 expansion was kept . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , both wave function renormalzation and vertex corrections were neglected @xcite , so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the massless fermion propagator is widely used when calculating the polarization function shown in fig.1 and the feedback effect of fermion mass is simply ignored . within this approximation , the polarization function has the form @xmath30        the aim of this work is to go beyond the popular rpa calculation and include the dynamical fermion gap back into the polarization function shown in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> . the importance of this treatment can be readily seen by making a simple qualitative analysis . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the effective strength of coulomb interaction is characterized by two ingredients : interaction parameter @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the dielectric constant and static / dynamical screening due to collective particle - hole excitations . while the former is determined by the substrate of graphene sample , the latter is reflected in the polarization function . within rpa </S>",
    "<S> , the polarization function ( 5 ) behaves as @xmath33 in the static limit @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> it vanishes linearly as @xmath35 , so the coulomb interaction remains long - ranged . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effective coulomb interaction is weakened by the dynamical screening term @xmath36 , which arises from particle - hole excitations . in the chiral symmetry broken phase , </S>",
    "<S> the dirac fermion has a finite mass . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a constant mass @xmath5 , the polarization function becomes @xmath37 in the limit @xmath38 , it is simplified to @xmath39 at the low energy regime , this contribution is much less than the term @xmath33 of the polarization function obtained using the massless fermion propagator ( rpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this reflects the fact that a finite fermion gap reduces the dynamical screening effect . </S>",
    "<S> because of this reduction , the effective coulomb interaction becomes much stronger .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , the fermion mass gap is not a constant , but depends explicitly on momentum . to examine the feedback effect of fermion gap on excitonic transition </S>",
    "<S> , we will utilize the eliashberg formalism and couple the fermion gap equation to the equation of polarization function self - consistently .        in the eliashberg formalism </S>",
    "<S> , the vertex corrections are usually ignored . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is well - justified in the electron - phonon interacting systems as the migdal theorem ensures that the vertex corrections are suppressed by a small factor @xmath40 , where @xmath5 is the electron mass and @xmath41 is the nuclei mass @xcite . in the present problem , we still have a small suppressing factor in the vortex corrections based on the @xmath8 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by considering the vertex correction diagram for polarization shown in fig.2 . in the large @xmath0 limit , </S>",
    "<S> it is found ( details are presented in the appendix ) to have the form @xmath42 apparently , we know that @xmath43 so the polarization function with vertex correction @xmath44 is suppressed by a small factor @xmath45 comparing with the leading polarization function @xmath27 , and therefore can be neglected in the large @xmath0 limit . </S>",
    "<S> one can verify in a similar way that the same is also true with the vertex correction diagram for the fermion self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments for the suppression of vertex corrections are extensively used in the eliashberg theories of a plenty of physical problems , including fermion - gauge systems @xcite , quantum critical points in itinerant electron systems @xcite , and electron - doped cuprate superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the wave function renormalization @xmath20 also contain certain powers of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this paper we will ignore both vertex corrections and wave function renormalizations .    in order to make a more general analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the problem at finite temperature @xmath46 and finite chemical potential @xmath47 and study how the static screening of coulomb interaction due to finite @xmath46 and @xmath47 is affected by fermion mass . </S>",
    "<S> we will work in the matsubara formalism and replace the fermion energy @xmath48 by an imaginary frequency , @xmath49 . at finite @xmath46 , it is convenient to adopt an instantaneous approximation @xcite and ignore the energy - dependence of the interaction function . at finite @xmath47 , </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath50 appearing in fermion propagator should be replaced by @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the instantaneous approximation allows us to perform the frequency summation over @xmath52 analytically , leading to the gap equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we need to compute the polarization function @xmath55 that contains the dynamical fermion mass function @xmath56 . within the instantaneous approximation , </S>",

    "<S> , we would like to make some remarks on the instantaneous approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation was originally proposed in the study of dynamical fermion gap generation at finite temperature in qed@xmath63 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> technically , when calculating the fermion gap equation and polarization function , it is possible to sum over the imaginary frequencies in the matsubara formalism only when the energy ( frequency ) dependence of polarization function is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , there will be infinitely many coupled gap equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in order to make a qualitative analysis of the screening effects , we need to obtain an ( semi)analytical expression for the polarization function , as eq.(11 ) , which can be derived only within the instantaneous approximation . at zero temperature and zero chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> , it is formally viable to include the energy dependence of the polarization function . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have solved the fermion gap equation without assuming the instantaneous approximation @xcite , but using the rpa polarization function ( 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the dynamical part of the rpa polarization function was also investigated in a recent paper of gamayun _ et _ _ al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . due to the non - relativistic nature of the present coulomb - interacting system , the integrations over energy and momenta have to be performed separately , which substantially increases the time needed to perform numerical computations . in the eliashberg formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we need to go beyond the rpa level and solve the self - consistently coupled equations for the fermion gap and the polarization function . </S>",
    "<S> this requires much more computer time and would significantly reduce the precision of numerical output . in order to retain the necessary numerical precision </S>",
    "<S> , we use the instantaneous approximation even at zero temperature and zero chemical potential .     </S>",
    "<S> dependence of dynamical fermion gap at zero momentum and zero temperature . at physical flavor @xmath14 , </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath70 , the polarization function behaves as @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this expression implies that the coulomb interaction is now statically screened by finite chemical potential and thus becomes short - ranged . </S>",
    "<S> such static screening effect will rapidly destroy the excitonic pairing instability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the fermion gap is relatively large , @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 in the low momentum regime , so the coulomb interaction remains long - ranged and is only poorly screened . from this qualitative analysis , we know that once the feedback effect of fermion gap is included , the static screening may be suppressed and the effective coulomb interaction may still be strong even at finite chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> besides chemical potential , thermal fluctuation can also induce static screening @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of fermion gap on static screening at finite temperature can be qualitatively analyzed similarly . </S>",
