    "tde is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when a star gets too close to a supermassive black hole in the galaxy center and is disrupted by the tidal force of the black hole .",
    "part of stellar material is bound and accreted by the central black hole , resulting in a bright optical , uv and soft x - ray emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there are growing number of candidate tdes being discovered in soft x - ray , ultraviolet and optical surveys , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "recently , three unusual tde candidates are discovered by _ swift _ , i.e. swift j164449.3 + 573451 swift j2058.4 + 0516 swift j1112.2 - 8238 ( hereafter sw j1644 + 57 , sw j2058 + 05 and sw j1112 - 82 for short respectively ) , which have very bright non - thermal hard x - ray and radio emissions @xcite .",
    "the luminous non - thermal x - ray and radio emissions are thought to be produced by relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "sw j1644 + 57 shows a highly variable light curve in x - rays , as observed by x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard _",
    "swift_. at redshift @xmath6 , the isotropic luminosity of the x - ray emission is as high as @xmath7 erg / s .",
    "sw j2058 + 05 exhibits a luminous , long - lived x - ray outburst with an isotropic peak luminosity of @xmath8 ( at redshift @xmath9 ) .",
    "its total isotropic energy ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) on timescale of the first two months amounts to @xmath10 erg .",
    "sw j1112 - 82 was initially also discovered by swift / bat ( burst alert telescope ) in june 2011 as an unknown , long - lived ( order of days ) @xmath11-ray transient source .",
    "it exhibits a similar bright x - ray flare and its position is consistent with the nucleus of a faint galaxy at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the peak x/@xmath11-ray luminosity of sw j1112 - 82 exceeds @xmath13 .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emission is thought to be produced by synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons .",
    "one would naturally expect inverse - compton scattering emission from the same electrons , which may produce high - energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "as the three tdes with relativistic jets emit a total isotropic energy of about @xmath10 erg in x - ray band , comparable to or even larger than that in the grb prompt emission and blazars flares , one would expect the high - energy gamma - ray emission detectable by _ fermi_/lat .",
    "motivated by this , we search for high - energy gamma - ray emission from these three relativistic tdes .",
    "asassn-14li is a normal optically - discovered tde at distance of about 90 mpc @xcite .",
    "transient radio emission has been detected from this event and modeling of the radio emission gives a kinetic energy of @xmath14 erg in a non - relativistic or mildly relativistic outflow @xcite .",
    "the relativistic electrons producing radio emission may in principle also produce high - energy gamma - ray emission , although the flux level depends on the energy of these electrons and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "it was also proposed that the unbound debris after the disruption will encounter the interstellar medium or dense molecular clouds around the central massive black hole , producing high - energy @xmath15-ray afterglow through @xmath16 collisions .",
    "thus , we also search for high - energy gamma - ray emission from the normal tde asassn-14li .",
    "the analysis of the _ fermi _ lat data of tdes is presented in section 2 .",
    "we present the result for each tde in section 3 .",
    "furthermore , we compare the high - energy gamma - ray emission of relativistic tdes with that of grb prompt emission and blazar flares",
    ". then in section 4 , we derive constraints on the bulk motion lorentz factor of the source based on the non - detection of the high energy emission .",
    "finally we give a short summary . throughout this paper , we take the standard @xmath17cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath18 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 mev to greater than 300 gev , and operates primarily in an all - sky scanning survey mode @xcite .",
    "the lat data currently being released by the fssc ( _ fermi _ science support center ) have been processed using the `` pass 8 '' ( p8r2 ) event - level analysis , and specifically p8r2 source event class data are selected here .",
    "the analysis is based on the lat science tool version v10r0p5 . in order to reduce the contamination from earth limb emission ,",
    "less than @xmath21 of lat rocking angle and less than @xmath22 of local zenith angle are required .",
    "moreover , we exclude the time period when the spacecraft is above the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "we perform an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis of the selected data with the following method .",
    "front - back converting photons ( evtype =3 ) of energies between 100 mev and 10 gev are divided into twenty logarithmically spaced energy bins for fitting of a power law spectrum ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "all events in a region of interest ( roi ) of @xmath24 have been used , and point sources and extending sources within extra @xmath25 in the lat 4-year point source catalog ( 3fgl)@xcite are added to the model file .",
    "the galactic diffuse and isotropic emission are molded with gll_iem_v06.fits and iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt respectively .",
    "when it leaves too many free parameters to gain a good spectral fit for a faint source at a short time interval , we fix the spectral form and free the normalization ( prefactor ) of faint or distant background sources .",
    "the above data analysis thread would be made products for selected tdes .",
    "binned analysis is considered to check the results .    for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we also analyze the _",
    "fermi_/lat data of two typical blazars , i.e. mrk 421 and 3c 279 , during some flare episodes @xcite .",

    "for grbs , we select the first _ fermi _ lat grb catalog @xcite as our sample for comparison with tdes .",
    "the processing procedure for the lat data of grbs follows our previous work @xcite .",
    "thanks to _ swift_/bat @xcite , for bright x - ray sources such as the three relativistic tdes mentioned above , we can get the daily average count rate in the survey mode ( data quality flag = 0 ) @xcite ( because sw j1644 + 57 was mistaken for a grb , it was observed by bat burst mode and had a good follow - up observation @xcite ) . considering the limited bat energy band ( 15 - 50 kev ) , the corresponding flux will be displayed in the sed plot ( figure [ sed3 ] ) as one data point .",
    "the likelihood analysis of sw j1644 + 57 centered at the position ( ra . , dec.)=(@xmath26 ) results in a low ts value ( @xmath27 ) , i.e. no significant high - energy emission is found from the bat trigger time to one hundred days after the trigger ( @xmath28s ) .",

    "we fix the spectral photon index at @xmath29 .",
    "taking different spectral index @xmath30 will result in a slight , but insignificant difference .",

    "the data of the gev fluence and x/@xmath11-ray fluence are presented in figure [ comparison3 ] , which are consistent with the results in the _ fermi _ lat first gamma - ray burst catalog ( see their fig .",

    "the modeling of 0.1 - 10 gev spectrum of mrk 421 with a simple power law function gives a photon index of @xmath51 , whereas it gives a soft photon index with @xmath52 for 3c 279 , which are consistent with the statistic characteristic of joint bat - lat spectral properties of blazars @xcite .",
    "long - time 0.1 - 300 gev data gives a preferred spectral model logarithmic parabola for 3c279 in 3fgl , so we check our result with this spectral model and find almost no difference in the fluence . the results of their x/@xmath11-ray and gev fluences are listed in table [ fluencecom ] . )",
    "may not be appropriate , but anyway , a few times change of x/@xmath11-ray ( 10 - 1000 kev ) fluence will not make the fluence ratio below 1% in figure [ comparison3 ] . ]    in figure [ comparison3 ] , we compare the x/@xmath11-ray fluence and gev fluence of the three types of relativistic sources .",

    "blazar flares have similar properties and all of them have gev fluences larger than a few per cent of the x/@xmath11-ray fluences .",
    "in contrast , the gev fluences of all three relativistic tdes are smaller than 1% of the x/@xmath11-ray fluences .",
    "this may indicate that the high - energy gamma - ray emission in tdes are highly absorbed , as we will discuss below .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emission in three relativistic tdes may be produced by relativistic electrons via synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the size of the source is estimated to be @xmath53 , where @xmath30 is the bulk lorentz factor of the source , @xmath54 is the variability timescale of x - ray emission and we have assumed that the jet aligns with the light of sight of the observer .",

    "units and the denotation @xmath55 in the paper .",
    "the observed minimum variability time of the x - ray emission in sw j1644 + 17 is about @xmath56 @xcite . assuming that the magnetic field energy density is in equipartition with the radiation energy density , the magnetic field in the comoving frame of the source is estimated to be @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the equipartition factor .",
    "for such a magnetic field , the x - ray photons with frequency @xmath59 are produced by relativistic electrons with lorentz factors of @xmath60 .",
    "for these electrons , we expect an inverse - compton component peaking at @xmath61 when other parameters are taken with typical values",
    ". the ic flux should be comparable to or larger than that of the synchrotron component if @xmath62 , thus we would expect a gev component with a luminosity of @xmath63 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the non - detection of such a high - energy component can be attributed to a high absorption opacity due to low - energy photons in the source , i.e. the @xmath64 absorption optical depth should be @xmath65 .",
    "the optical depth for @xmath64 absorption is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the cross section for @xmath64 absorption ( @xmath68 is the thompson cross section ) and @xmath69 is the comoving - frame number density of the target photons that interact with high - energy photons . for high energy photons with energy @xmath70 , the energy of the target photons is @xmath71 . for a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath72 @xcite , the number density of target photons",
    "is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "one can derive an upper limit on the bulk lorentz factor from the condition @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 this shows that the bulk lorentz factors in tdes are much lower than that of grbs @xcite , and may even be lower than that of some blazars .",
    "we searched for the high - energy gamma - ray emission from tdes with the _ fermi _ lat survey data , including three tdes confirmed with relativistic jets ( sw j1644 + 57 , sw j2058 + 05 , sw",
    "j1112 - 82 ) and the nearest normal tde asassn-14li .",
    "no significant emission is found from these tdes during the period from the _ swift_/bat trigger time ( or the inferred disruption time ) to about one hundred days later .",
    "compared with the bright non - thermal x - ray emission , the non - detection of high - energy emission in three relativistic tdes implies that high energy emission is seriously suppressed , most likely due to the @xmath77 attenuation by soft photons in the source .",
    "then , we derive an upper limit on the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath1 , for relativistic jets in tdes .",
    "the non - detection of high - energy emission from the normal tde asassn-14li gives an upper limit of @xmath78 during the first @xmath5 s after the disruption , which is already lower than the x - ray luminosity @xcite , but still higher than the predicted gamma - ray luminosity .",
