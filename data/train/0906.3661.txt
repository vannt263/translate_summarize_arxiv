    "competing interactions , or frustration , are common in systems of interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "the frustration arises from the fact that each of the interactions in competition tends to favor its own characteristic spatial correlations .",
    "a more operational definition classifies a system as frustrated whenever it can not minimize its total classical energy by minimizing the interaction energy between each pair of interacting degrees of freedom , pair by pair .",
    "frustration is ubiquitous in condensed matter physics .",
    "it arises in liquid crystals , in superconducting josephson junction arrays in a magnetic field , in molecular crystals such as solid n@xmath5 , and in magnetic thin films .",
    "frustration is important outside the realm of condensed matter physics in , for example , the competition between nuclear forces and long - range electrostatic coulomb interactions between protons which is believed to lead to the formation of a so - called  nuclear pasta \" state of spatially modulated nuclear density in stellar interiors .",
    "this enhances the scattering cross - section for neutrinos with nuclear matter and may be a factor in the mechanism of supernovae explosions . yet , perhaps , the most popular context for frustration is in magnetic systems .",
    "this review is concerned with the many interesting and often exotic magnetic and thermodynamic phenomena that have been observed over the past twenty years in a broad family of geometrically frustrated magnetic materials , the pyrochlore oxides . before launching into the review per se ,",
    "we first briefly outline what is meant by geometric magnetic frustration and comment on the scientific motivation for investigating geometrically frustrated magnetic systems .",
    "although the details will be provided later , here we give the reader a brief introduction to the key issues in frustrated magnetic systems .",
    "one can distinguish two classes of frustrated magnetic systems : those in which the frustration is _ geometric _ and those in which it is _ random_. the simplest example of geometric frustration",
    "is that of ising spins which can only point in two possible ( up or down ) directions , interacting via nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange and which lie at the vertices of an equilateral triangle as shown in fig .",
    "[ gfminanutschell ] . under those conditions , it is impossible for the three spins to align mutually antiparallel to each other .",
    "when many triangles are condensed to form an edge - sharing triangular lattice , a massive level of configurational spin disorder results , giving rise to an extensive residual zero temperature entropy and no phase transition down to absolute zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "this example is one of geometric frustration since it is the regular periodic structure of the ( here triangular ) space lattice that imposes the constraint inhibiting the development of a long range ordered state given antiferromagnetic interactions between the spins . the same system with ising spins on a triangular lattice ,",
    "but with ferromagnetic interactions , is not frustrated and displays a second order phase transition to long range order at nonzero temperature .",
    "one can distinguish two types of random frustration .",
    "the first one arises due to competing interactions among degrees of freedom in full thermodynamic equilibrium , as in the case of liquid crystals and the nuclear pasta mentioned above .",
    "although it is not commonly referred to as such , one could speak of  dynamical frustration \" or  annealed frustration \" , by analogy to annealed disorder . since there is rarely only one type of interaction setting a sole characteristic length scale in any realistic system ,",
    "annealed frustration is really the norm . in this context ,",
    "the most dramatic signature of dynamical frustration occurs when multiple length scales develop , as in modulated phases of condensed matter , for example the case of stripes in the copper oxide superconducting materials , or in the case of reentrant phase transitions , as in some liquid crystal materials . in other words ,",
    "a system with competing interactions will often attempt to resolve the underlying frustration by developing non - trivial spatial correlations , such as modulated structures , whenever full dynamical equilibrium is maintained .",
    "we will return below to the topic of multiple dynamical degrees of freedom and annealed frustration when we discuss the role that lattice degrees of freedom may play in geometrically frustrated magnetic systems .",
    "the other case of random frustration arises when the randomness is  quenched \" , i.e. frozen in .",
    "this occurs when a subset of the degrees of freedom evolve on a time scale that is , for all practical purposes , infinitely long compared to the predominant degrees of freedom under focus .",
    "consider the example above of the triangular lattice ising antiferromagnet .",
    "there , the position of the atoms is quenched and only the magnetic ( spin ) degrees of freedom are dynamical .",
    "this is an example of quenched frustration .",
    "however , the frustration in that case is said to be _ geometric _ , not random . quenched random frustration arises in systems where the frozen degrees of freedom ( e.g. positions of the magnetic atoms ) are not related by periodic translational invariance .",
    "one example of random frustration is that of magnetic iron ( fe ) atoms in a gold ( au ) matrix . in aufe",
    ", the interaction between the fe moments is mediated by conduction electrons via the rkky ( rudermann - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ) @xmath6 interaction , which can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the distance @xmath7 between two magnetic fe atoms .",
    "depending on their relative separation distance , some trios of fe spins will have either one or three of their @xmath8 interactions antiferromagnetic , and will therefore be frustrated .",
    "because the atomic positions are frozen - in , this is an example of _ quenched random frustration_. quenched random frustration is a crucial ingredient in the physics of spin glass materials  @xcite .",
    "these systems exhibit a transition between a paramagnetic state of thermally fluctuating spins to a glass - like state of spins frozen in time , but random in direction .",
    "random frustration can also arise when the magnetic moments in an otherwise disorder - free geometrically frustrated system are diluted , or substituted , with non - magnetic atoms  @xcite .    while it is common to invoke exchange interactions between spins as the source of their magnetic coupling , there are cases , discussed in some detail below , where magnetostatic dipole - dipole interactions play a crucial role . because of their long - range nature and angular dependence ,",
    "dipolar interactions are intrinsically frustrated , irrespective of the lattice dimensionality or topology .",
    "indeed , two dipole moments @xmath9 and @xmath10 at positions @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) reach their minimum energy for @xmath9 @xmath14 @xmath15 . obviously , this condition can not be met for any system of more than two dipole moments that are not all located on a perfectly straight line . as a result ,",
    "even systems where long - range collinear ferromagnetism is due to dipolar interactions , are in fact frustrated , and display quantum mechanical zero point fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this example illustrates that even systems which achieve a seemingly simple , conventional long range order can be subject to frustration of their underlying microscopic interactions .",
    "being intrinsically frustrated , the introduction of randomness via the substitution of dipole - carrying atoms by non - magnetic ( diamagnetic ) species , can lead for sufficiently large dilution to a spin glass phase  @xcite .",
    "magnetism and magnetic materials are pervasive in everyday life , from electric motors to hard disk data storage . from a fundamental perspective , magnetic materials and theoretical models of magnetic systems",
    "have , since the original works of ising and potts , offered physicists perhaps the best test bench to investigate the broad fundamental concepts , even at times universal ones , underlying collective phenomena in nature .",
    "the reasons for this are threefold .",
    "firstly , from an experimental perspective , magnetic materials present themselves in various aspects .",
    "they can be metallic , insulating or semiconducting .",
    "as well , the magnetic species may reside on crystalline lattices which are spatially anisotropic , providing examples of quasi - one or quasi - two dimensional systems and permitting an exploration of the role that spatial dimensionality plays in phase transitions . secondly , and perhaps most importantly",
    ", magnetic materials can be investigated via a multitude of experimental techniques that can probe many aspects of magnetic and thermodynamic phenomena by exploring spatial and temporal correlations over a range of several decades of length or time scales . finally , from a theoretical view point , magnetic materials can often be described by well - defined microscopic hamiltonian models which , notwithstanding the mathematical complexity commonly associated in solving them , allow in principle to develop a theoretical framework that can be used to interpret experimental phenomena .",
    "this close relationship between theory and experiment has been a key characteristic of the systematic investigation of magnetism since its incipiency .",
    "such a symbiotic relationship between experiment and theory has been particularly strong in the context of investigations of frustrated magnetism systems .",
    "indeed , a number of experimental and theoretical studies in frustrated magnetic systems were originally prompted by theoretical proposals .",
    "we briefly mention two .",
    "the first pertains to the proposal that frustrated antiferromagnets with a non - collinear ordered state may display a transition to a paramagnetic state belonging to a different (  chiral \" ) universality class from conventional o(n ) universality for collinear magnets  @xcite .",
    "the second , perhaps having stimulated the largest effort , is that some frustrated quantum spin systems may lack conventional semi - classical long - range order altogether and possess instead a quantum disordered ",
    "spin liquid \" state breaking no global spin or lattice symmetries  @xcite .",
    "systems where magnetic moments reside on lattices of corner - sharing triangles or tetrahedra are subject to geometric magnetic frustration , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gfminanutschell ] , and are expected to be ideal candidates for exhibiting large quantum mechanical spin fluctuations and the emergence of novel , exotic , magnetic ground states .    the cubic pyrochlore oxides , @xmath16@xmath17o@xmath18 , have attracted significant attention over the past twenty years because the @xmath3 and @xmath4 ions reside on two distinct interpenetrating lattices of corner - sharing tetrahedra as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unit cell ] .",
    "henceforth , we shall refer to the lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra simply as the pyrochlore lattice , as has become customary since the mid 1980 s .",
    "if either @xmath3 , @xmath4 or both are magnetic , and the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic , the system is highly geometrically frustrated . as a result ,",
    "antiferromagnetically coupled classical heisenberg spins on the pyrochlore lattice do not develop long range order at any nonzero temperature , opening up new avenues for novel , intrinsically quantum mechanical , effects to emerge at low temperatures .    in all real systems , interactions beyond isotropic nearest - neighbor exchange",
    "are at play .",
    "exchange beyond nearest - neighbors , symmetric and antisymmetric ( dzyaloshinskii - moriya ) exchange , dipolar interactions and magnetoelastic couplings are all concrete examples of corrections to the isotropic nearest - neighbor exchange part of the hamiltonian , @xmath19 .",
    "these additional interactions , @xmath20 , are typically weaker than @xmath19 and , often , two or more terms in @xmath20 compete to dictate the development of the spin - spin correlations as the system is cooled from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the specific details pertaining to the material under consideration determine whether the perturbations @xmath20 are able , ultimately , to drive the system into a semi - classical long - range ordered state , or whether quantum fluctuations end up prevailing .",
    "it is for this reason that many magnetic pyrochlore oxides have been found to display a gamut of interesting and unconventional magnetic and thermodynamic behaviors .",
    "examples of phenomena exhibited by @xmath21o@xmath18 materials include spin glass freezing in y@xmath5mo@xmath5o@xmath18 , spin liquid behavior in tb@xmath5ti@xmath5o@xmath18 , disordered spin ice ( not to be confused with spin glass ) phenomenology in ho@xmath5ti@xmath5o@xmath18 and dy@xmath5ti@xmath5o@xmath18 , ordered spin ice in tb@xmath5sn@xmath5o@xmath18 , order - by - disorder in er@xmath5ti@xmath5o@xmath18 , unconventional anomalous hall effect in metallic nd@xmath5mo@xmath5o@xmath18 , superconductivity in cd@xmath5re@xmath5o@xmath18 and the kondo - like effect in pr@xmath5ir@xmath5o@xmath18 , to name a few .",
    "the above examples illustrate the broad diversity of phenomena exhibited by pyrochore oxides .",
    "there exist a number of general reviews concerned with pyrochlore structure materials such as those by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and more focused reviews for example on the rare earth titanates , @xcite . as well , pyrochlore structure materials are often featured in more general reviews of geometrically frustrated magnetic materials , such as those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide , given the space limitations , a comprehensive review of both experimental and theoretical investigations of the @xmath21o@xmath18 materials over the past twenty years or so .",
    "whenever possible , we outline what we perceive as promising avenues for future work .",
    "thus , space limitations preclude detailed discussion of other very interesting highly frustrated magnetic materials based on lattices of corner - shared triangles such as kagome systems and garnets , or the spinels and laves phases , which are also based on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "however , we will refer to those materials in specific contexts whenever appropriate in order to either contrast or relate to the behavior observed in the pyrochlore oxides .",
    "this review is organized as follows : after a brief historical overview and some generalities on geometrically frustrated magnets we review and discuss experimental data from the most static ( i.e. long range ordered phases ) to the most dynamic ( i.e. spin liquid phases ) . then follows a brief section on the superconducting compounds found among pyrochlore oxides ,",
    "although frustration has not been demonstrated to play a role here . finally , we report on salient results from experiments performed under the influence of applied magnetic field or pressure .",
    "we conclude the review by a brief discussion of perceived avenues for future research .",
    "the term frustration , meaning the inability of a plaquette of spins with an odd number of antiferromagnetic bonds to adopt a minimum energy collinear spin configuration , first appeared in a paper on spin glasses by @xcite and soon after , in one by @xcite .",
    "however , it is said that the concept of frustration as a key ingredient in the physics of spin glasses was first introduced by anderson who apparently wrote on a blackboard at a summer school in aspen in 1976 _ `` frustration is the name of the game '' _",
    "it is interesting that the notion of frustration , random frustration to be more precise , had to await the discovery of spin glasses before it was introduced in magnetism .    indeed ,",
    "geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets , without being labeled as such , had been studied much earlier . in 1950 ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the exact solution of the ising antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice , finding that no transition to long range order occurs at positive temperature and that the system possesses an extensive ground state entropy .",
    "soon after , following on a previous work by @xcite , @xcite investigated the problem of antiferromagnetic spin arrangements in spinel ferrite materials and the role of magnetic interactions between the octahedral and the tetrahedral sites in determining the ground state spin structure , where the octahedral sites form a pyrochlore lattice",
    ". motivated by the problem of magnetic ordering for spins on the octahedral sites of normal spinels and the related one of ionic ordering in inverse spinels , @xcite investigated the physics of antiferromagnetically coupled ising spins on what we now recognize as the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "this work appears to have been the first to identify clearly the peculiar magnetic properties of this system and , in particular , noted the existence of a macroscopic number of ground states , and the connection with the problem of the zero point proton entropy in hexagonal water ice previously investigated by @xcite .",
    "we will return to the connection between geometrically frustrated ising spins on the pyrochlore lattice and the water ice problem later .",
    "quantum mechanics made its first noticeable entry in the realm of geometrically frustrated magnetism in 1973 when @xcite proposed that a regular two - dimensional triangular lattice of spins @xmath22 coupled via nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange could , instead of displaying a three sublattice 120 degree nel ordered state , possess an exotic _ resonating valence bond _ liquid of spin singlets .",
    "this proposal was further examined and its conclusion supported by more detailed calculations by  @xcite . while @xcite had written that there were no experimental realizations of an @xmath22 antiferromagnet with isotropic exchange , the situation would change dramatically almost twenty - five years later with the 1987 discovery of the copper - oxide based high - temperature superconductors , some of which possess a parent insulating state with antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath22 spins  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of spin glasses by @xcite prompted a flurry of experimental and theoretical activity aimed at understanding the nature of the observed spin freezing and determining whether a true thermodynamic _ spin glass _ phase transition occurs in these systems . particularly relevant to this review",
    ", @xcite investigated the general problem of insulating spin glasses and the role of weak dilution of the @xmath4-site pyrochlore lattice in spinels .",
    "the extensive ground state degeneracy characterizing this system for classical heisenberg spins interacting via nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath23 was noted .",
    "he speculated that such a system would remain in a paramagnetic - like state down to zero temperature , giving rise to a state at temperatures @xmath24 that he called a _ collective paramagnet _ @xmath25 a classical spin liquid of sorts .",
    "@xcite also considered the case of tetragonal spinels where there are two exchange couplings , @xmath23 and @xmath26 , perpendicular and parallel to the tetragonal axis .",
    "more recently , theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies have investigated the cubic to tetragonal distortion in spinels , which leads to a relief of the magnetic frustration and allows the system to develop long range magnetic order .",
    "villain discussed how the effect of a _ weak _ dilution of the magnetic moments may be dramatically different in the case of cubic spinels compared to those with a slight tetragonal distortion .",
    "in particular , he argued that in the case of the cubic spinel , weak dilution would leave the system a collective paramagnet , while for the tetragonal spinel the ground state would be glassy .",
    "while there had been some experimental studies on non - collinear magnets between the work of villain and the mid - to - late 1980 s  @xcite , the high level of research activity in the field of frustrated magnetism really only started following the discovery of the unconventional magnetic properties of srcr@xmath27ga@xmath28o@xmath29 ( scgo ) by @xcite . in the context of oxide pyrochlores , the topic of this review , experimental and theoretical interests developed in the mid-1980 s with reports of spin glass behavior in the apparently well - ordered material y@xmath5mo@xmath5o@xmath18 and accelerated rapidly after 1990 .",
    "the amount of theoretical work dedicated to the topic of highly frustrated systems , particularly quantum spin systems , has exploded over the past ten years .",
    "it is beyond our scope here to discuss more than a fragment and in fact the field is so active that a dedicated review would at this time be warranted .",
    "short of such being available , we refer the reader to a somewhat recent book edited by @xcite and a forthcoming one by edited by @xcite . in this section",
    ", we merely present the simplest and most generic theoretical arguments of relevance to the pyrochlore systems .",
    "the focus of the discussion is on the effects of perturbations on a nearest - neighbor heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet .",
    "one simple and highly convenient measure of the level of frustration in magnetic system is the so - called _ frustration index _",
    "@xmath30  @xcite , defined as @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the curie or curie - weiss temperature , defined from the high temperature paramagnetic response of the system , i.e. the high temperature , linear part of the inverse dc susceptibility .",
    "the temperature @xmath33 is the critical temperature @xmath34 ( or nel temperature , @xmath35 ) at which the system ultimately develops long range spin order . in the case of freezing into a glassy state , which may correspond to a genuine thermodynamic spin glass transition , @xmath33 would be the freezing temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the more frustrated a system is , the lower @xmath33 is compared to @xmath32 , hence an ideal spin liquid system would have @xmath37 . in most real materials",
    "there are , however , perturbative interactions , @xmath20 that ultimately intervene at low temperature and lead to the development of order out of the spin liquid state .",
    "the rest of this section discusses some of the most common perturbations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to anticipate the absence of long range order at nonzero temperature in the ising  @xcite and heisenberg  @xcite pyrochlore antiferromagnet .",
    "the hamiltonian for the heisenberg antiferromagnet model is @xmath38 where we take for convention that @xmath39 is antiferromagnetic while @xmath40 is ferromagnetic .",
    "the spins @xmath41 can be , at least within the model , taken either as classical and of fixed length @xmath42 or quantum .",
    "a model with @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 components of @xmath46 corresponds to the ising , xy and heisenberg model , respectively . since the pyrochlore lattice has cubic symmetry , the ising and xy models with a uniform global ising easy axis direction @xmath47 or xy global plane are not physical .",
    "one can however , define local @xmath48 ising directions or local xy planes with normal @xmath48 that are parallel to the four cubic @xmath49 directions .    a mean field theory calculation for the heisenberg hamiltonian by @xcite provided indirect confirmation of anderson and villain s result by finding that a nearest - neighbor model with classical heisenberg spins on the pyrochlore lattice has two ( out of four ) branches of exactly degenerate soft ( critical ) modes throughout the brillouin zone . in other words , there is an extensive number of soft modes in this system and no unique state develops long range order at the mean field critical temperature . in early monte carlo simulations , @xcite found no sign of a transition in this system , either to long range order or to a more complex type , such as nematic order , down to a temperature of @xmath50 , where @xmath23 is the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange constant",
    ". this conclusion was confirmed in numerical studies by @xcite .",
    "this behavior of the nearest - neighbor pyrochlore antiferromagnet differs markedly from that of the nearest - neighbor classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on the two - dimensional kagome lattice where co - planar order - by - disorder develops as the temperature drops below @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "however , the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem forbids a phase transition at nonzero temperature in the kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "while no transition is seen in the pyrochlore heisenberg system  @xcite , the pyrochlore lattice with easy - plane ( xy ) spins , where the easy planes are perpendicular to the local @xmath49 directions , displays a phase transition to long range order  @xcite .",
    "finally , in agreement with anderson s prediction  @xcite , monte carlo simulations find that the ising antiferromagnet , or equivalently the ising ferromagnet with local @xmath49 directions , which is the relevant model to describe spin ice materials , does not order down to the lowest temperature  @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the conditions under which an @xmath52-component classical spin @xmath53 with @xmath54 arranged on a lattice of corner - sharing units of @xmath55 sites and interacting with @xmath56 neighbors in each unit can exhibit thermally - induced order - by - disorder .",
    "their analysis allows one to rationalize why the heisenberg @xmath45 kagome antiferromagnet develops co - planar order and why the xy pyrochlore antiferromagnet ( with spins in a global xy plane ) develops collinear order  @xcite . from their analysis , one would predict a phase transition to long range nematic order for @xmath57 in three spatial dimensions .",

    ", one would generally expect interactions beyond nearest - neighbors to drive a transition to an ordered state , at least for classical spins  @xcite .",
    "while this has been studied via monte carlo simulations  @xcite , it has not been the subject of very many investigations . in that context",
    ", we note that a paper by @xcite studies a classical heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet with an additional exchange interaction @xmath26 that interpolates between the pyrochlore lattice @xmath63 and the face - centered cubic lattice @xmath64 .",
    "it is found that for @xmath65 as low as @xmath66 , the system orders into a collinear state whose energy is greater than the classical incommensurate ground state predicted by mean field theory .",
    "a monte carlo study of another classical model of a pyrochlore lattice with antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange and ferromagnetic next nearest - neighbor exchange finds an ordered state with mixed ordered and dynamical character  @xcite . because the pyrochlore lattice lacks bond inversion symmetry ,",
    "dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) spin - spin interactions arising from spin - orbit coupling are allowed by symmetry and can give rise to various ordered states depending on the orientation of the dm vector  @xcite .    as we will discuss below ,",
    "a number of pyrochlore materials exhibit glassy behavior where the spins freeze at low temperature into a state where their orientation is random in space , but frozen in time  @xcite .",
    "it is not yet fully understood whether this glassy behavior is due to the intrinsic nature of the systems considered , as is the case for the spin ices , or if it originates from random disorder ( e.g.  antisite disorder , random bonds or other ) as in conventional random disorder spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "only a very few theoretical studies have explored the effect of random disorder in antiferromagnetic pyrochlores with classical heisenberg spins and with small and homogoneously random deviations of exchange @xmath67 from the average antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , random bonds on a single tetrahedron lift the degeneracy and drive an order - by-(random)-disorder to a collinear spin arrangement .",
    "however , on the lattice , the system remains frustrated and there is no global order - by - disorder  @xcite .",
    "considering this model in more detail , @xcite find compelling evidence of a conventional spin glass transition .",
    "@xcite have investigated how coupling with the spins to the lattice may lead to a freezing behavior and trapping of the spins into metastable states in an otherwise disorder - free nearest - neighbor classical pyrochlore antiferromagnet .",
    "@xcite discussed the role of non - magnetic impurities on the pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "he argued that the collective paramagnetic behavior of the otherwise disorder - free system should survive up to a finite concentration of impurities .",

    "this is because the unfilled magnetically active 4f orbitals are strongly shielded by the 5s , 5p and 5d orbitals and their direct exchange overlap or superexchange overlap is small . at the same time , trivalent rare earths often possess large magnetic moments and hence the magnetostatic dipole - dipole energy scale is significant compared to @xmath32 and needs to be incorporated into eq .",

    "[ spinice ] , there is also a rather direct connection between the spin configurations in the pyrochlore problem and that of the proton positions in water ice .",
