    "one of the most basic problems of qcd is to identify all the clusters of quarks , antiquarks and gluons that are sufficiently bound by qcd interactions that they are either stable particles or appropriately long - lived to be observed as resonances  @xcite . to this respect ,",
    "charm hadron physics has become a cornerstone due to the experimental findings during the last decade . on the one hand one encounters the outstanding discovery in charmonium spectroscopy of the flagship of the so - called @xmath7 states , the @xmath8  @xcite . before this discovery , and based on gell - mann conjecture  @xcite , the hadronic experimental data were classified either as @xmath9 or @xmath10 states according to @xmath11 irreducible representations . however , since 2003 more than twenty meson resonances reported by different experimental collaborations , most of them close to a two - meson threshold , had properties that made a simple quark - antiquark structure unlikely  @xcite .",
    "although this observation could be coincidental due to the large number of thresholds in the energy region where the @xmath7 mesons have been reported , it could also point to a close relation between some particular thresholds and resonances contributing to the standard quark - antiquark heavy meson spectroscopy . on the other hand ,",
    "a similar situation has arisen in the charm baryon spectrum during the last years with the advent of a large set of experimental data ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive update of the experimental and theoretical situation of the heavy baryon spectra ) .",
    "the properties of some excited states show an elusive nature as three - quark systems .",
    "likewise the charmonium spectrum , some of them are rather close to a baryon - meson threshold suggesting a possible molecular or compact structure  @xcite . it has been already highlighted within a simple toy model the key role that @xmath12 wave meson - baryon thresholds may play in matching poor light - baryon mass predictions from quark models with data  @xcite .",
    "thus , the analysis of possible multiquark contributions close to meson - baryon thresholds with a full - fledged quark dynamical model could help in the understanding of heavy baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the existence of molecular contributions in the charm baryon spectrum stem primarily on the interaction between charm mesons and nucleons , what on the other hand has turned into an interesting subject in several contexts  @xcite .",
    "it is particularly interesting for the study of chiral symmetry restoration in a hot and/or dense medium  @xcite .",
    "it will also help in the understanding of the suppression of the @xmath13 production in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "besides , it may shed light on the possible existence of exotic nuclei with heavy flavors  @xcite . experimentally",
    ", it will become possible to analyze the interaction of charm mesons with nucleons inside nuclear matter with the operation of the fair facility at the gsi laboratory in germany  @xcite .",
    "there are proposals for experiments by the @xmath6anda collaboration to produce @xmath14 mesons by annihilating antiprotons on the deuteron .",
    "this could be achieved with an antiproton beam , by tuning the antiproton energy to one of the higher - mass charmonium states that decays into open charm mesons .",
    "these experimental ideas may become plausible based on recent estimations of the cross section for the production of @xmath15 pairs in proton - antiproton collisions  @xcite .",
    "there are also different theoretical estimations about the production rate at @xmath6anda of @xmath16 baryons through the direct process @xmath17",
    ". the identification of hadronic molecular states and/or hadrons with multiquark components either with or without exotic quantum numbers is also a challenge in relativistic heavy ion collisions offering a promising resolution to this problem  @xcite .",
    "besides the lhcb  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations are providing a huge dataset of new measurements of heavy flavor spectroscopy . in the coming future",
    ", j - parc also intends to contribute to the experimental measurement of exotic baryons .",
    "thus , a good knowledge of the interaction of charm mesons with ordinary hadrons , like nucleons or @xmath18 , is a prerequisite .    before one can infer in a sensitive manner changes of the interaction in the medium  @xcite , a reasonable understanding of the interaction in free space",
    "is required . however , here one has to manage with an important difficulty , namely the complete lack of experimental data at low energies for the free - space interaction .",
    "thus , the generalization of models describing the two - hadron interaction in the light flavor sector could offer insight about the unknown interaction of hadrons with heavy flavors .",
    "this is the main purpose of this work , to make use of a chiral constituent quark model describing the @xmath1 interaction  @xcite as well as the meson spectrum in all flavor sectors  @xcite to obtain parameter - free predictions that may be testable in future experiments .",
    "such a project was already undertaken for the interaction between two charm mesons  @xcite and also for the interaction between anticharm mesons and nucleons  @xcite what encourages us in the present challenge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we will first present a brief description of the quark - model wave function for the baryon - meson system .",
    "we will later on revisit the interacting potential and finally we will summarize the solution of the two - body problem by means of the fredholm determinant . in sec .",
    "[ secv ] we present and discuss our results .",
    "we will first briefly discuss the baryon - meson interaction in comparison to hadronic models .",
    "we will analyze the character of the different isospin - spin channels , looking for the attractive ones that may lodge resonances either as a molecule or as a compact five  quark state , to be measured by experiment .",
    "we will also compare with existing results in the literature . finally , in sec .",
    "[ secvi ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in order to describe the baryon - meson system we shall use a constituent quark cluster model , i.e. , hadrons are described as clusters of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "assuming a two - center shell model the wave function of an arbitrary baryon - meson system , a baryon @xmath19 and a meson @xmath20 , can be written as : @xmath21^{lst } \\ , ,   \\label{gor}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the antisymmetrization operator accounting for the possible existence of identical quarks inside the hadrons . in the case",
    "we are interested in , baryon - meson systems made of @xmath23 or @xmath24 baryons and @xmath14 or @xmath25 mesons , no identical quarks can be exchanged between the baryon and the meson and thus no sharp quark - pauli effects are expected .    if we assume gaussian @xmath26 wave functions for the quarks inside the hadrons , the normalization of the baryon - meson wave function @xmath27 of eq .",

    "where the two hadrons overlap ( @xmath31 ) , the pauli principle does not impose any antisymmetry requirement .",
    "this can be easily checked for the @xmath32 partial waves , where such effects would be prominent . using the asymptotic form of the bessel functions , @xmath33",
    ", we obtain the @xmath12 wave normalization kernel in the overlapping region that behaves like a constant for @xmath34 , @xmath35{}{\\hbox to 20pt{\\rightarrowfill } } 4\\pi \\left\\lbrace { 1 -\\frac{r^2}{8 }   \\left ( \\frac{4}{b^2 } + \\frac{1}{b_c^2}\\right)}\\right\\rbrace    \\left\\lbrace 1   +   \\frac{1}{6 } \\left ( \\frac{r^2}{8 b_c^2}\\right)^2    \\left ( 1+\\frac{4b_c^2}{b^2}\\right)^2   + ... \\right\\rbrace \\,.\\ ] ]      the two - body interactions involved in the study of the baryon - meson system are obtained from the chiral constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "this model was proposed in the early 90 s in an attempt to obtain a simultaneous description of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the baryon spectra .",
    "it was later on generalized to all flavor sectors  @xcite . in this model hadrons",
    "are described as clusters of three interacting massive ( constituent ) quarks , the mass coming from the spontaneous breaking of the original @xmath36 chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian .",

    "non - perturbative effects are due to the spontaneous breaking of the original chiral symmetry at some momentum scale . in this domain of momenta ,",

    "finally , any model imitating qcd should incorporate confinement .",
    "being a basic term from the spectroscopic point of view it is negligible for the hadron - hadron interaction .",
    "lattice calculations suggest a screening effect on the potential when increasing the interquark distance  @xcite , @xmath56 once perturbative ( one - gluon exchange ) and nonperturbative ( confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ) aspects of qcd have been considered , one ends up with a quark - quark interaction of the form @xmath57 \\rightarrow v_{\\rm con}(\\vec{r}_{ij})+v_{\\rm oge}(\\vec{r}_{ij})+v_{\\chi}(\\vec{r}_{ij } ) &   \\\\",

    "notice that for the particular case of heavy quarks ( @xmath61 or @xmath29 ) chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and therefore boson exchanges do not contribute .",
    "the parameters of the model are those of ref .",
    "the model guarantees a nice description of the baryon ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 )  @xcite and the meson ( @xmath14 and @xmath25 ) spectra  @xcite .    in order to derive the local @xmath62 interaction from the basic @xmath63 interaction defined above",
    ", we use a born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "explicitly , the potential is calculated as follows , @xmath64 where @xmath65 in the last expression the quark coordinates are integrated out keeping @xmath66 fixed , the resulting interaction being a function of the baryon - meson relative distance . the wave function @xmath67 for the baryon - meson system has been discussed in sec .",
    "[ seciia ] .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the different diagrams contributing to the baryon - meson interaction .",
    "as compared to the @xmath68 case  @xcite and due to the absence of quark - exchange contributions , the number of diagrams is greatly reduced , getting just purely hadronic interactions .      .interacting baryon - meson channels in the isospin - spin @xmath69 ) basis .",
    "see text for details . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     hence , as we have already illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , an important source of attraction might be the coupled - channel effect of the two thresholds , @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "thus , to check the efficiency of this mechanism , we have repeated the calculation of sec .",
    "[ seciv ] but considering all physical states reflected in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we have represented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the lowest baryon - meson thresholds contributing to each set of @xmath71 quantum numbers .",
    "in table  [ tab4 ] we have summarized the character of the interaction in the different @xmath71 channels .",
    "when the @xmath72 and @xmath73 thresholds are sufficiently far away , the coupled - channel effect is small , and bound states are not found . however , when the thresholds move closer",
    ", the coupled - channel strength is increased , and bound states may appear for a subset of quantum numbers . hence , threshold vicinity is a required but not sufficient condition to bind a five  quark state . under these conditions , there are the channels with high spin @xmath74 the only ones that may lodge a compact five - quark state for all isospins as it is shown in fig .",
    "the reason stems on the reverse of the ordering of the thresholds , being the lowest threshold @xmath72 the one with the more attractive interaction . in the other cases , the break apart threshold @xmath73 , weakly interacting , is the lowest one destroying the possibility for any resonance",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where we show the fredholm determinant for the @xmath4 channel . when one only considers @xmath0 channels ( solid line ) the interaction is attractive and it has a bound state . however , when the lowest break apart threshold is considered ( dashed line ) the bound state does not appear any more .    as already advertised in the first part of our discussion , of particular interest",
    "is the @xmath5 state , that survives the consideration of the break apart thresholds .",
    "it may correspond to the @xmath75 pentaquark found by the qcd sum rule analysis of ref .",

    "such state could be also detected by the propagation of @xmath14 mesons in nuclear matter as an @xmath12 wave @xmath78 system and it thus constitutes a challenge for the @xmath79anda collaboration .",
    "summarizing , we have studied higher order fock space components on the charm baryon spectrum . for this purpose",
    "we have used two different approaches . in a first step we did a coupled - channel calculation of the @xmath0 system looking for molecular states . in a second step we allowed for the coupling to a heavy baryon ",
    "light meson system looking for compact exotic five  quark states .",
    "both calculations have been done within the framework of a full - fledged chiral constituent quark model .",
    "this model , tuned in the description of the baryon and meson spectra as well as the @xmath1 interaction , provides parameter - free predictions for charm @xmath2 molecular or compact two - hadron systems . unlike the @xmath3 system",
    ", no sharp quark - pauli effects are found due to the non - existence of quark - exchange diagrams and thus of the oge contribution .",
    "the importance of the coupled - channel dynamics has been emphasized to connect with the result of other hadronic models .",
    "we have found several close to threshold resonances in the @xmath0 system that could be traced back to some of the measured charm baryon excited states . if the full dynamics of the five  quark system is considered the number of resonances is reduced and their energies augmented .",
    "of particular interest is the prediction of a @xmath5 baryonic state , that survives the consideration of the break apart thresholds .",
    "it may correspond to the @xmath75 pentaquark found by the qcd sum rule analysis of ref .",
