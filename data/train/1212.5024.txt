    "with the rapid growth of wireless data traffic , multi - user interference has become a major bottleneck that limits the performance of the existing wireless communication services .",
    "mathematically , we can model such an interference - limited communication system as a multi - user interference channel in which a number of linearly interfering transmitters simultaneously send private data to their respective receivers . exploiting time / space / frequency / code diversity are effective approaches to mitigate / manage multi - user interference .",
    "for instance , when the transmitters and/or receivers are equipped with multiple antennas , a joint optimization of the physical layer transmit - receive beamforming vectors for all users can efficiently mitigate multi - user interference@xcite ; when all transmitters and receivers are equipped with a single antenna , one way to control / mitigate multi - user interference is to impose certain frequency restrictions or transmission power limits on the frequency resources used by each transmitter@xcite . in particular , orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) is a form of multi - carrier transmission and is suited for frequency selective channels and high data rates .",
    "this technique effectively decomposes a frequency - selective wide - band channel into a group of non - selective narrowband subchannels ( subcarriers ) , which makes it robust against large delay spreads by preserving orthogonality in the frequency domain .",
    "moreover , the ingenious introduction of cyclic redundancy at the transmitter reduces the complexity to only fft processing and one tap scalar equalization at the receiver@xcite .    conventional ofdma schemes _ preassign _ subcarriers to users in a nonoverlapping way , thus users ( transmitting on different subcarriers ) cause no interference to each other .",
    "although the ofdma scheme is well suited to be used in a high - speed communication context where quality of service is a major concern , it can lead to inefficient bandwith utilization .",
    "this is because that the preassignment of subcarries can not adapt traffic load and channel fluctuations in space and time ; i.e. , a subcarrier preassigned to a user can not be released to other users even if it is unusable when the user s channel conditions are poor . to adapt these fluctuations and improve the overall system s throughput , ofdma based subcarrier allocation networks such as worldwide interoperability for microwave access ( wimax)@xcite and long term evolution ( lte)@xcite should be equipped with _",
    "dynamic _ subcarrier and power allocation algorithms .",
    "in particular , a dynamic ofdma based subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is well suited for the _ dense _ femtocell downlink system@xcite , where a large number of femtocells close to each other are deployed in a macrocell .",
    "the joint optimization of subcarrier and power allocations for the multi - user ofdma system is a nonconvex problem , therefore various heuristics approaches have been proposed for this problem @xcite .",
    "very recently , the authors in @xcite proposed a dynamic joint frequency and transmission power allocation scheme called enhanced dynamic frequency planning ( edfp ) .",
    "edfp is a hybrid centralized and distributed architecture , where a central broker first dynamically partitions subcarriers among neighboring cells so that the long - term cell - edge inter - cell interference is minimized , and then each cell independently allocates subcarriers and transmission power to its users in a way that its total transmission power is minimized .",
    "notice that nonconvex optimization problems are difficult to solve in general .",
    "however , not all nonconvex problems are hard to handle since the lack of convexity may be due to an inappropriate formulation , and many nonconvex optimization problems indeed admit a convex reformulation @xcite",
    ". therefore , nonconvexity of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem for the multi - user ofdma system does not imply that it is computationally intractable ( strongly np - hard in terms of computational complexity theory@xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to characterize the computational complexity of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem for the multi - user ofdma system ; i.e. , to categorize when the problem is ( strongly ) np - hard and when it is polynomial time solvable .",
    "in fact , the dynamic spectrum management problem _ without the ofdma constraint",
    "_ ( at most one user is allowed to transmit power on each subcarrier ) has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the dynamic spectrum management problem is ( strongly ) np - hard when the number of subcarriers is greater than two , or when the number of users is greater than one .",
    "however , the analysis of these results is highly dependent on the crosstalk channel gains among users ; i.e. , some of the crosstalk channel gains are assumed to be large enough , and some of them are assumed to be zero .",
    "we shall see late ( in section [ sec - model ] ) that the magnitude of crosstalk channel gains has no influence on the user s transmission rate if all users are required to transmit power in an orthogonal manner .",
    "this makes the two problems ( the dynamic spectrum management problem without the ofdma constraint in @xcite and the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem with the ofdma constraint considered in this paper ) sharply different from each other .",
    "an interesting result shown in @xcite is that the optimal solution of the two - user _ sum - rate _ maximization problem is automatically ofdma if the crosstalk channel gains of the two users on each subcarrier are large enough .",
    "in addition , based on the fact that the duality gap of the dynamic spectrum management problem is zero as the number of subcarriers goes to infinity ( regardless of the convexity of the objective function)@xcite , dual decomposition algorithms have been proposed in @xcite for the nonconvex optimization problem of multi - carrier systems , again without considering the ofdma constraint .    in this paper , we focus on the characterization of the computational complexity status of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem for the _ multi - user ofdma system_. in particular , we consider two formulations of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem .",
    "the first one is the problem of minimizing the total transmission power in the system subject to all users quality of service constraints , all users power budget constraints per subcarrier , and the ofdma constraint .",
    "the second one is the problem of maximizing the system utility ( including the sum - rate utility , the proportional fairness utility , the harmonic mean utility , and the min - rate utility ) while the total transmission power constraint of each user , individual power constraints on each subcarrier , and the ofdma constraint are respected .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we show that the aforementioned two formulations of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem are strongly np - hard . the proof is based on a polynomial time transformation from the @xmath0-dimensional matching problem .",
    "the strong np - hardness results suggest that for a given ofdma system , computing the optimal subcarrier and power allocation strategy is generally intractable .",
    "thus , instead of insisting on finding an efficient algorithm that can find the global optimum of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem , one has to settle with less ambitious goals , such as finding high quality approximate solutions or locally optimal solutions of the problem in polynomial time .",
    "second , we also identify several subclasses of the joint allocation problem which can be solved to global optimality or @xmath1-global optimality in polynomial time .",
    "we therefore clearly delineate the set of computationally tractable problems within the general class of np - hard joint subcarrier and power allocation problems .",
    "specifically , we show in this paper that , when there is only a single user in the system or when the number of subcarriers and the number of users are equal to each other , the total transmission power minimization problem is polynomial time solvable ; when there is only a single user , the aforementioned four utility maximization problems are all polynomial time solvable .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - model ] , we introduce the system model and give the two formulations of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem for the multi - user ofdma system . in section",
    "[ sec - hard ] , we first give a brief introduction to computational complexity theory@xcite and then address the computational complexity of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem .",
    "in particular , we show that the aforementioned two formulations of the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem are generally strongly np - hard .",
    "several subclasses of the joint allocation problem which are polynomial time solvable are identified in section [ sec - easy ] .",
    "finally , the conclusion is drawn in section [ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the system model and problem formulation . consider a multi - user ofdma system , where there are @xmath3 users ( transmitter - receiver pairs ) sharing @xmath4 subcarriers . throughout the paper , we assume that @xmath5 ; i.e.",

    "the basic idea of proving the strong np - hardness of problem with @xmath61 is to reduce it to the one with @xmath168 more specifically , we first partition all users into two types ( type - i and type - ii ) and also all subcarriers into two types ( type - i and type - ii ) , where the number of type - i subcarriers is required to be twice as large as the number of type - i users .",
    "then , we construct `` good '' channel parameters between type - i ( type - ii ) users and type - i ( type - ii ) subcarriers while `` bad '' channel parameters between type - i ( type - ii ) users and type - ii ( type - i ) subcarriers such that the only way for all users to satisfy their transmission rate requirements is that type - i ( type - ii ) users will only transmit power on type - i ( type - ii ) subcarriers .",
    "in addition , in our construction , all type - ii users and type - ii subcarriers are dummy ones , since all type - ii users transmission rate requirements can easily be satisfied by transmitting full power on type - ii subcarriers . in this way , the problem of checking the feasibility of problem with @xmath61 reduces to the one of checking whether all type - i users transmission rate targets can be met or not , where the number of type - i subcarriers is twice larger than the number of type - i users ( @xmath323 ) as required in the partition .",
    "below is the detailed proof of theorem [ thm - feasi2 ] . by lemma [ thm - feasi ]",
    ", we only need to consider the following two cases : ( i ) @xmath324 and ( ii ) @xmath325 .    in case ( i ) , we partition @xmath3 users into @xmath326 type - i users and @xmath327 type - ii users , and @xmath328 subcarriers into @xmath329 type - i subcarriers and @xmath327 type - ii subcarriers .",
    "we construct the channel parameters of type - i users on type - i subcarriers in the same way as in the proof of lemma [ thm - feasi ] where @xmath323 .",
    "furthermore , noise powers , direct - link channel gains , and power budgets of all type - ii users on type - ii subcarriers are set to @xmath330 @xmath331 and @xmath332 respectively ; these parameters of all type - i users on type - ii subcarriers and all type - ii users on type - i subcarriers are set to @xmath333 and @xmath331 respectively .",
    "all type - ii users desired transmission rate targets are set to be @xmath334 see fig .",
    "[ plot ] for the corresponding ofdma system .",
    "our construction is such that the channel condition of the type - i ( type - ii ) users on the type - i ( type - ii ) subcarriers is reasonably better than the one of the type - i ( type - ii ) users on the type - ii ( type - i ) subcarriers .",
    "one can check that the only possible way for all @xmath3 users to meet their transmission rate targets is that , each type - ii user transmits full power on ( any ) one type - ii subcarrier ( actually type - ii users and subcarriers are dummy users and subcarriers ) and all type - i users appropriately transmit power on type - i subcarriers . by lemma [ thm - feasi ] , however , checking whether all type - i users transmission rate requirements can be satisfied is strongly np - hard .     where @xmath323 .",
    "noise powers , direct - link channel gains , power budgets of type - ii user(s ) on type - ii subcarriers are set to @xmath330 @xmath331 and @xmath332 respectively ; these parameters of type - i users on type - ii subcarriers and type - ii user(s ) on type - i subcarriers are set to @xmath333 and @xmath331 respectively . for case ( i ) , the transmission rate targets of type - ii users are all set to @xmath334 for case ( ii ) , the transmission rate target of the single type - ii user is set to @xmath335,width=366 ]    in case ( ii ) , we partition @xmath3 users into @xmath336 type - i users and @xmath115 type - ii user , and @xmath328 subcarriers into @xmath337 type - i subcarriers and @xmath338 type - ii subcarriers .",
    "we construct the channel parameters of type - i users on type - i subcarriers in the same way as in the proof of lemma [ thm - feasi ] where @xmath168 moreover , noise powers , direct - link channel gains , and power budgets of the single type - ii user on type - ii subcarriers are set to @xmath330 @xmath331 and @xmath332 respectively ; these parameters of all type - i users on type - ii subcarriers and the single type - ii user on type - i subcarriers are set to @xmath333 and @xmath331 respectively .",
    "the transmission rate of the single type - ii user is required to be not less than @xmath335 see fig .",
    "[ plot ] for the corresponding system .    due to special construction of the system",
    ", one can check that the only way for all @xmath3 users to meet their transmission rate targets is that , the single type - ii user transmits full power on all type - ii subcarriers and all type - i users appropriately transmit power on type - i subcarriers .",
    "again , by lemma [ thm - feasi ] , checking whether all type - i users transmission rate requirements can be satisfied is strongly np - hard .",
    "we first prove the strong np - hardness of problem for the special case @xmath323 and then prove their strong np - hardness for the general case @xmath339    * we first consider the case @xmath85 .",

    "* strong np - hardness of problem with @xmath354 and @xmath355 * for the cases @xmath356 and @xmath357 , notice that for all @xmath358 , @xmath359 ,  , @xmath360 @xmath361 and the equalities hold if and only if @xmath362 therefore , the optimal value of @xmath363 or @xmath364 is greater than or equal to @xmath0 if and only if the answer to the @xmath0-dimensional matching problem is yes .",
    "this implies the strong np - hardness of all the four utility maximization problems with @xmath323 .",
    "now we consider the general case @xmath365 we show the strong np - hardness of problem for the general case @xmath61 by constructing some dummy users and subcarriers as in the proof of theorem [ thm - feasi2 ] .",
    "take the sum - rate maximization problem as an example .",
    "it is simple to check that    * in case @xmath366 the sum - rate utility function of the constructed system is greater than or equal to @xmath367 if and only if the given instance of the @xmath0-dimensional matching problem with size @xmath326 has a positive answer ; * in case @xmath171 the sum - rate utility function of the constructed system is greater than or equal to @xmath368 if and only if the given instance of the @xmath0-dimensional matching problem with size @xmath336 has a positive answer .    hence , the sum - rate maximization problem in the case that @xmath61 is strongly np - hard .",
    "similar results also hold true for the other three utility functions .",
    "we omit the proof for brevity .",
    "to show is the solution to problem , let us first write down the kkt condition of problem .",
    "suppose @xmath369 are the lagrangian multipliers corresponding to the constraints @xmath370 @xmath371 and @xmath372 respectively , then the kkt condition of problem is given as follows @xmath373        & \\displaystyle \\sum_{n\\in{{\\cal n}}}p^n\\leq p,~\\lambda\\geq 0,~\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{n\\in{{\\cal n}}}p^n - p\\right)=0,\\\\[15pt ]        &   p^n\\geq p^n,~\\xi^n\\geq 0,~(p^n - p^n)\\xi^n=0,~n\\in{{\\cal n}},\\\\[6pt ]        &   p^n\\geq 0,~\\nu^n\\geq0,~p^n\\nu^n=0,~n\\in{{\\cal n}}.      \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] since problem is convex for any fixed @xmath181 , it follows that the kkt condition is necessary and sufficient for @xmath374 to solve problem .",
    "therefore , to show is the solution to problem , it suffices to show that there exist appropriate lagrangian multipliers such that @xmath375 satisfy the kkt system .",
    "next , we construct appropriate @xmath376 such that @xmath374 in together with the constructed @xmath376 satisfy all the conditions in .    specifically , we choose @xmath377 such that the objective value of problem is equal to @xmath203 and    * if @xmath378 in , then @xmath379 we set @xmath380 and @xmath381 * if @xmath382 in , then @xmath383 we set @xmath384 * if @xmath234 in , then @xmath385 set @xmath386 and @xmath387    it is simple to check @xmath388 constructed in the above satisfies the kkt system .  hence , is the solution to problem .",
    "in combinatorics , a stirling number of the second kind @xcite , denoted by @xmath389 is the number of ways to partition a set of @xmath4 objects into @xmath3 nonempty subsets , where @xmath390 .",
    "stirling numbers of the second kind obey the following recursive relation @xmath391 with initial conditions @xmath392 and @xmath393 for any @xmath394 to understand this formula , observe that a partition of @xmath395 objects into @xmath3 nonempty subsets either contains the @xmath396-th object as a singleton ( which corresponds to the term @xmath397 in ) or contains it with some other elements ( which corresponds to the term @xmath398 in ) .",
    "next , we claim by induction that @xmath399 in fact , when @xmath400 we obtain @xmath401 this is because that dividing @xmath402 elements into @xmath3 sets means dividing it into one set of size @xmath123 and @xmath336 sets of size @xmath151 therefore , we only need to pick those two elements .",
    "assume that @xmath403 we show that @xmath404 by invoking , we have@xmath405 = & s(k+c-1,k-1)+k{s(k+c-1,k)}\\\\[3pt ] \\leq&s(k+c-1,k-1)+k{\\left(k+c-1\\right)}^{2(c-1)}\\\\[3pt ] \\leq&s(k+c-1,k-1)+{\\left(k+c\\right)}^{2c-1}\\\\[3pt ] \\leq&\\sum_{k=1}^k \\left(k+c\\right)^{2c-1}\\\\[3pt ] \\leq&(k+c)^{2c } , \\end{array}\\]]which shows that @xmath406 holds true .",
