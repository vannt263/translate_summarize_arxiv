    "<S> in a previous paper [ phys .  </S>",
    "<S> rev .  * d * 83 , 113013 ( 2011 ) ] we have shown that the solar sector data ( solar and kamland ) are sensitive to the parameter @xmath0 , encoding the admixture of the electron neutrino with a fourth ( essentially ) sterile mass eigenstate . in that work we evidenced that such data prefer a non - zero value of @xmath0 and that such a preference is completely degenerate with that of non - zero @xmath1 . in this report </S>",
    "<S> we show how the evidence of @xmath2 , recently emerged from global neutrino data analyses , lifts such a degeneracy and disfavors the case of sterile neutrino mixing . by excluding from our analysis the total rate information coming from the reactor experiments we untie our results from any assumption on their flux normalization . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we establish the robust upper bound @xmath3 at the 90% c.l .    in a recent paper  @xcite we have introduced the theoretical framework needed to describe solar neutrino oscillations within the so - called @xmath4 schemes endowed with @xmath5 new sterile neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> ( see also  @xcite ) . in the same work , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the constraints attainable within such schemes from the `` solar sector '' ( solar and kamland data ) showing that this dataset , while preferring a non - null admixture of the electron - neutrino with mass eigenstates `` far '' from the solar ( @xmath6 ) doublet , is currently unable to distinguish if such a mixing is realized with the third standard mass eigenstate @xmath7 or with new ones ( @xmath8 ) . in the simplest @xmath9 framework </S>",
    "<S> , this ambiguity translates into a degeneracy of the estimates of the standard mixing angle @xmath1 and the new angle @xmath0 ( see  @xcite for the details of the parameterization of the lepton mixing matrix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> after publication of  @xcite new data have been released that are relevant to the analysis therein performed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the long - baseline ( lbl ) accelerator experiments tokai - to - kamioka ( t2k )  @xcite and the main injector neutrino oscillation search ( minos )  @xcite have both evidenced a phenomenon of @xmath10 conversion . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the reactor experiment double - chooz ( d - chooz )  @xcite , currently operating only with the far detector , has found an indication of @xmath11 disappearance . </S>",
    "<S> these findings , if interpreted within the standard 3-flavor framework , point towards a non - zero value of @xmath1 , in line with the first indications arising from global neutrino data analysis  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , with the inclusion of the new crucial piece of information , an updated global neutrino data analysis  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) provides therein established . </S>",
    "<S> a preference for @xmath2 around the 3@xmath12 level has been shown also in the analysis performed in  @xcite , which includes d - chooz ( together with minos and t2k ) , but not the solar and atmospheric data . ] </S>",
    "<S> evidence of @xmath13 at more than 3@xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> this new circumstance prompts us to improve the analysis performed in  @xcite , in order to determine how it is affected by the new critical experimental information . </S>",
    "<S> substantial changes with respect to the results presented in  @xcite are expected . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , due to the strong anti - correlation existing among the two mixing angles @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the clear preference now emerged for a non - zero value of one of the two parameters ( @xmath1 ) should drastically reduce the likelihood of the other one ( @xmath0 ) to be different from zero . quantifying such a qualitative expectation appears particularly urgent in view of the numerous ongoing projects of new experimental setups aimed at testing potential oscillations into sterile neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> ( see for example  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the new landscape brings us to adopt a more conservative approach with respect to that espoused in  @xcite , as here our prime aim is to establish a robust estimate of @xmath0 independent of any assumption on the determinations of the reactor antineutrino fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , their recent recalculations  @xcite , indicating an upward shift of about @xmath14 with respect to previous estimates , have not only refueled the interest around sterile neutrinos , but have also engendered an intense debate around possible systematic uncertainties , being common opinion that these may not be entirely under control . having this issue in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we will treat the reactor data in a special way , minimizing the impact of the systematic uncertainties affecting the antineutrino fluxes . more specifically , in both the short - baseline reactor experiments ( chooz and d - chooz ) and the long - baseline ones ( kamland ) , we will ignore the ( flux dependent ) _ total rate _ </S>",
    "<S> information , considering only that one provided by the energy _ </S>",
    "<S> spectral shape_.    this stratagem , </S>",
    "<S> although slightly limiting the constraining power of the analysis , will render its results particularly robust . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as discussed in  @xcite , the kamland analysis is quite sensitive to the reactor flux normalization . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the indication in favor of non - zero @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) arising from the solar sector fluctuates between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , adopting , respectively , the old or the new ( higher ) fluxes  @xcite . as a rule of thumb </S>",
    "<S> , we have verified that an upward ( downward ) 1@xmath17 shift of the reactor fluxes corresponds to a @xmath18 increase ( decrease ) in the statistical significance of the preference for a non - zero electron neutrino mixing with @xmath7 ( or @xmath19 ) . by removing the kamland total rate information from the analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we eliminate any dependency on the reactor flux normalization . in practice , with this procedure , the mixing angles @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( and to a large extent also the `` solar '' mixing angle @xmath20 ) are basically constrained by the solar data augmented provided by the kamland spectral shape , would have a reduced sensitivity to all mixing angles . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the kamland spectral shape provides little information on these last ones . </S>",
    "<S> ] by the knowledge of the solar squared - mass difference @xmath21 , whose high - precision determination is preserved by retaining the kamland spectral shape information .    </S>",
    "<S> analogous considerations apply to the chooz and d - chooz experiments . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case more ( less ) disappearance , and thus a preference of larger ( smaller ) values of @xmath1 or @xmath0 , is driven by higher ( lower ) reactor fluxes . differently from kamland , however , the spectral information does not give any information on the relevant ( atmospheric ) mass - splitting @xmath22 , this being independently determined by the lbl @xmath23 disappearance searches performed at accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that , in principle , the chooz and d - chooz spectral information could distinguish between the @xmath7-driven ( distorted ) and @xmath19-driven ( undistorted ) get completely averaged if @xmath24 ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the region of the parameter space of current interest ( confined to values of @xmath25 ) , we can safely assume that the ( @xmath26)-induced oscillations are completely averaged with a consequent undistorted energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the situation would be different at a detector located near to the reactor core ( not operational at present ) , where non - negligible ( @xmath26)-induced spectral distortions are expected ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we remark that in the solar sector the new oscillations get averaged provided that @xmath27 , as we have shown in  @xcite . ] ) oscillated spectra , but its impact is negligible in practice since the expected distortions are very small ( see the `` analysis c '' in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the observation of such spectral distortions will be a challenge even for the next - generation of reactor experiments equipped with near detectors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the achievement of this goal appears now even more important in light of the opportunity of testing and distinguishing standard and non - standard physics .    ) and atmospheric ( @xmath28 ) mass - mixing parameters by the solar sector data ( diagonal bands ) and lbl accelerator data ( vertical bands ) . </S>",
    "<S> right panel : regions allowed by their combination . </S>",
    "<S> the contours refer to @xmath29 ( dotted line ) and @xmath30 ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2],width=13 ]    concerning the data sensitive to @xmath21 our analysis includes all the relevant solar and kamland data as described in detail in  @xcite , but here the kamland absolute normalization is treated as a free parameter . as in [ 1 ] we have made the assumption that the additional mixing angles involving sterile neutrinos are null ( @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> , implying in our parameterization ( see  @xcite ) @xmath32 , is justified by the negative results of the short - distance disappearance searches performed in the @xmath23 channel  @xcite , by the atmospheric data analyses  @xcite , and by the neutral current interaction searches performed by minos  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these last ones provide the stringent upper bound @xmath33 at the 90% c.l .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for such small values the 4@xmath34-oscillation effects induced in lbl experiments , being ( doubly ) suppressed by the product @xmath35 , would have a negligible impact in our analysis . in passing , </S>",
    "<S> we notice that it is for the same reason that the excess of the electron - like events observed in t2k and minos is not imputable to oscillations into sterile states . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the regions allowed by the combined solar and kamland data represented by the diagonal bands in the left panel of fig .  1 show no preference for non - zero mixing . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior , which is slightly different respect to that observed in  @xcite ( where we found a weak preference for non - zero mixing ) , can be traced to the following three factors : ( i ) the solar data taken alone give @xmath36 as their best fit point;. ] ( ii ) the kamland spectral shape taken alone does not show any preference for non - zero @xmath1 or @xmath0 ; ( iii ) the well - known interplay of kamland and solar data in pushing the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) estimate upwards ( see  @xcite ) , so as to reduce the mismatch existing at @xmath37 among their ( slightly different ) determinations of the solar mixing angle @xmath20 , is now less effective since the kamland spectral shape has reduced sensitivity to this last parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning the data sensitive to @xmath22 , we incorporate the lbl accelerator results as in  @xcite , accounting for the @xmath23 disappearance searches performed at k2k  @xcite and minos  @xcite , and the latest @xmath10 appearance results from minos  @xcite and t2k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this dataset is insensitive to @xmath0 and delimits the vertical band in the left panel of fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> to understand this point one should observe that @xmath19-driven @xmath10 appearance effects are proportional to the mixing matrix element @xmath38 , which is set to zero in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the superposition ( left panel of fig .  1 ) of the two datasets sensitive respectively to @xmath39 and @xmath40 clearly evidences their complementarity in constraining the two mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> their synergy manifests quantitatively in their combination displayed in the right panel of fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> this provides the strong upper bound @xmath41 which constitutes the main result of this report . for the sake of completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we mention that if we had included the total rate information from the reactor experiments we would have obtained a slightly weaker upper bound . for example , adopting the new ( higher ) fluxes estimates the limit would become @xmath42 at 90% c.l . in any case , the anti - correlation existing among the two mixing angles , characteristic of the solar sector , combined with the independent preference for non - zero @xmath1 , leads to a strong upper bound on @xmath0 , also destroying any weak preference for a non - zero value of this parameter . as an additional check of the robustness of the bound in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bound ] ) we have verified that it is practically insensitive to the particular choice of the solar model used for the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is important in light of the yet unresolved `` metallicity issue '' and its connection with solar neutrino fluxes estimates ( see  @xcite for an updated discussion of the topic ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the bound in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bound ] ) is not incompatible with the estimates arising from the reactor  @xcite and gallium calibration  @xcite anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> rather , lying near their combined best fit  @xcite , it tends to select the lower part of the interval identified by such data . </S>",
    "<S> probing such relatively low values of @xmath0 with good precision should be the goal of any well - conceived experiment devoted to sterile oscillation searches .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that our limit is competitive with that one recently established in  @xcite using karmen and lsnd @xmath43-carbon cross sections , presenting the additional advantage of being independent of the new mass - squared splitting . </S>",
    "<S> this is a unique feature of the solar and reactor setups herein considered , where the new oscillations get completely averaged . </S>"
