    "this article presents the first version of an on - going online catalog of far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ; @xcite ) spectra of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "the catalog includes cv types and subtypes , as follows : dwarf novae ( u gem , z cam , ss cyg , wz sge and su uma subtypes ) , nova - likes ( vy scl / anti - dn , ux uma , sw sex subtypes ) , and magnetic systems ( ips , polars , dq her , am her subtypes ) .",
    "in addition the catalog also includes a few miscellaneous objects related to cvs such as novae ( of all types ) , symbiotics , and pre - cataclysmic variables . in table 1",
    "we list the objects in the catalog as of march 2012 . for each object",
    "the table includes ra ( j2000 ) , dec ( j2000 ) , type and subtype , binary orbital period , system inclination , reddening value , white dwarf mass , and distance . for each object , there is ( i ) at least one _ fuse _ spectrum , ( ii ) possibly a theoretical fit to the spectrum ( when the continuum can be modeled successfully ) , and ( iii ) basic data about the system including figures and downloadable ascii tables .",
    "the state ( outburst / high , quiescence / low or intermediate ) of each system at the time of observation is specified on the _ object page _ ( see sec.2.4 ) .    while @xcite has presented a summary of _ fuse _ spectra of cataclysmic variables , there are similarities and differences between their work and our catalog .",
    "the _ fuse _ survey of @xcite is an atlas of all the existing _ fuse _ spectra of all cvs , which includes basic information about each system ( type , orbital period and inclination ) and the _ fuse _ exposures ( data i d , exposure time , data quality , observation date and whether the data were obtained during a high / outburst or low / quiescent state ) .",
    "the spectra are discussed and characterized as a function of cv subtype : dne in quiescence , which are divided into those that exhibit a flat continuum with emission lines and those exhibiting absorption lines ( broad lyman lines and narrower metal lines ) ; dne in outburst ; nova - likes subdivided into narrow absorption lines , broad absorption lines , and with emission lines ; intermediate polars ; and polars .",
    "intrinsic spectral lines as well as prominent ism lines are tabulated .",
    "as such the paper of @xcite is really an atlas of _ fuse _ spectra of cvs , containing 99 objects where the spectra are catalogued according to their characteristics .",
    "the spectra are downloadable in fits format directly from the website ( mast ) where a preview is presented including basic line identification ( which is the same for all the spectra ) .    in comparison ,",
    "our catalog is more oriented toward the modeling and analysis of the spectra .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectra are downloadable as ascii tables which can then be easily used with computer modeling programs often used by theorists and/or compared directly with theoretical spectra obtained from ( e.g. ) tlusty and synspec @xcite .",
    "in addition to inclination and orbital period , our catalog also includes parameters that are usually needed in the modeling of spectra , such as white dwarf mass , distance , and reddening ( when these are known ) .",
    "we include a preview of the spectrum spread over three panels for better viewing , with individual line identifications for each object separately , including ism molecular hydrogen lines .",
    "when possible we provide results from the spectral modeling , including downloadable theoretical spectra in ascci format and additional system parameters such as mass accretion rate , wd temperature , stellar rotation rate , and chemical abundances .",
    "we also provide a list of references for each object . at the present time the catalog is still growing , and systems",
    "are being added with time .",
    "the catalog will eventually include all cvs and related objects that were observed with _",
    "fuse_. in the near future the catalog will also include a large database of theoretical spectra of ( solar composition ) wds covering a wide range of temperatures and gravity .",
    "the _ fuse _ telescope and its performance are described in detail by @xcite , and we give here only a short overview of some of its features and characteristics , as needed to explain and justify some of the procedures we followed to extract the final spectra .",
    "most of the _ fuse _ data were obtained through the 30``x30 '' lwrs large square aperture in time tag mode , and were processed with the latest and final version of calfuse ( v3.2.3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ data come in the form of eight spectral segments ( sic1a , sic1b , sic2a , sic2b , lif1a , lif1b , lif2a , and lif2b ) which are combined together to give the final _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "the spectral regions covered by the spectral channels overlap , and these overlap regions are then used to renormalize the spectra in the sic1 , lif2 , and sic2 channels to the flux in the lif1 channel .",
    "we then produce a final spectrum that covers the full _ fuse _ wavelength range 905 - 1187   .    the low sensitivity portions of each channel are usually discarded because of the low s / n there . in most channels there exists a narrow dark stripe of decreased flux in the spectra running in the dispersion direction , known as the `` worm '' , which can attenuate as much as 50% of the incident light in the affected portions of the spectrum ; - this is due to shadows thrown by the repeller grid wires above the detector . because of the temporal changes in the strength and position of the `` worm '' , calfuse can not correct target fluxes for its presence .",
    "therefore , we carried out a visual inspection of the _ fuse _ channels to locate the worm and we manually discarded that portion of the spectrum .",
    "calfuse , for the most part , takes care of removing several additional well - known issues , such as _ jitter _ and _ event bursts_. for faint sources _ background subtraction _ can be a problem for calfuse and we did have to remediate this problem by either ignoring or discarding those portions of the spectra affected by bad background subtraction .    due to these problems , for some of the systems , we had to discard the two sic channels completely",
    ". for other systems , large portions of the sic channels had to be removed and , as a consequence , some spectra exhibit a gap around 1080   .",
    "the channels that were the most reliable were the 1alif , 1blif and 2asic .",
    "the 2alif channel was moderately reliable and was used especially when the worm was affecting the 1blif channel .",
    "the 1asic and 1bsic channels were the most discarded , together with the 2blif channel .",
    "the 2bsic channel was discarded only when it was found to be of much lower quality than the lif channels .    in the final step , we combined the individual exposures ( unless otherwise specified ) and channels to create a time - averaged spectrum weighting the flux by the ( good ) exposure time and sensitivity of the input exposure and channel of origin , using a suite of fortran programs , unix scripts and iraf procedures ( which were all writen specifically for this purpose ) .    the observation log for the initial objects included in the catalog is given in table 2 , where we list the _ fuse _ data i d , the observation date , the observation time , the good exposure time and the state in which the system was observed ( i.e. high , low or intermediate ) .",
    "details of the data processing for each individual system are provided in the reference(s ) given in the link below the figure(s ) .",
    "some of these details are also listed individually for each object in the `` description panel '' ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the main emitting components contributing to the _ fuse _ spectra of cvs are the accretion disk and the wd . usually , the disk dominates during the high state ( or outburst ) , while the wd dominates during the low state ( or quiescence ) .",
    "the main feature of the spectra is the broad ly@xmath0 absorption feature , which can easily be used to assess the gravity and temperature of the emitting gas ( when this feature is not affected by e.g. large rotational broadening , strong ovi emission / absorption lines , and so on ) . at higher temperatures , as the continuum rises in the shorter wavelengths , the higher orders of the lyman series also become visible and",
    "can also be used ( when possible ) to accurately assess the temperature and gravity of the emitting gas .",
    "additional broad absorption lines of metals ( c , s , si , .. ) are detected and help determine the chemical abundances and projected rotational velocity of the emitting gas . in the present spectra , the main absorption features observed are : cii ( 1010   ) , ciii ( 1175   ) , siiii ( 1108 - 1114    and 1140 - 1144   ) , siiv ( 1067    and 1120 - 1130",
    " ) , siv ( 1073   ) , and nii ( 1085    when not contaminated by air glow ) .    on top of the spectrum ,",
    "broad emission lines are also found in some of the systems , mainly the ovi doublet and ciii ( 977    and 1175   ) , indicative of wind activity .    in table 3",
    "we provide a list of the ions and spectral lines expected for these sources in the _ fuse _ spectral range .",
    "the wavelengths are the theoretical rest wavelengths in   .    for al the systems we assign four line identification quality values as follows .",
    "+ a - a fully reliable line identification without contamination , the central wavelength of the line can easily be determined .",
    "+ b - a reliable line identification with possible contamination or / and blended with another line , the central wavelength of the line can not be determined with precision .",
    "+ c - a possible line identification , but less reliable than b , due to low s / n and other factors .",
    "a spectral feature is seen but is not identified with certainty . + d - the line is either not detected , or the detection is not reliable at all ; the line identification on the figure is tentative or is only informative ( to better show that the line is missing where it should be ) .",
    "a very noisy spectral feature is seen , or no spectral feature is detected at all ( flat continuum ) .",
    "+ for all the systems , in table 4 we tabulate these quality values for the most common spectral lines seen in cvs .    most of the _ fuse _ spectra show some ism molecular hydrogen absorption .",
    "the most affected targets reveal a spectrum literally `` sliced '' at almost equal intervals ( @xmath112   ) ; starting at wavelengths around 1110    and continuing towards shorter wavelengths all the way down to the hydrogen cut - off around 915   . in the affected _ fuse _ spectra , we identified the most prominent molecular hydrogen absorption lines by their band ( werner or lyman ) , upper vibrational level ( 1 - 16 ) , and rotational transition ( r , p , or q ) with lower rotational state ( j=1,2,3 ) .",
    "the most common ism lines are tabulated in table 5 .",
    "in addition , the targets that are weak _ fuse _ sources exhibit sharp emission lines from air glow ( geo- and helio - coronal in origin ; some of which are due to sunlight directly reflected inside the telescope ) , such as the hi series , svi ( 934     and 944   ) , ovi doublet , ciii ( 977   ) , and hei ( 1168   ) .    for each system",
    ", we mark on the ( online ) figures the lines that are detected as well as lines that are commonly seen for comparison .",
    "we created model spectra for high - gravity stellar atmospheres using the codes tlusty and synspec ( http://nova.astro.umd.edu ; @xcite ) .",
    "atmospheric structure is computed ( using tlusty ) assuming either a lte or a nlte atmosphere for a given stellar surface temperature and gravity , where the switch to nlte is made for hot models ( @xmath2 ) . in that manner",
    ", we generate photospheric models with effective temperatures ranging from 12,000  k to 75,000  k in increments of about 10% ( e.g. 1,000  k for t@xmath115,000  k and 5,000  k for t@xmath170,000  k ) .",
    "we choose values of the surface gravity @xmath3 ranging between 7.0 and 9.5 .",
    "the ( converged ) output stellar atmosphere model is then used as an input for the synthetic spectrum generator code synspec , and finally the code rotin is used to simulate the broadening of the lines due to stellar rotation and/or instrumentation .",
    "limb darkening is also included in rotin .",
    "the stellar rotational velocity @xmath4 varies from a few km  @xmath5 to 1000  km  @xmath5 . in order to fit the absorption features of the spectrum",
    ", we also vary the chemical abundances of the main species c , n , s and si . for any wd mass , there is a corresponding radius , or equivalently , one single value of @xmath3 @xcite , which also depends on the temperature and composition of the wd @xcite .    the same suite of codes",
    "can also be used to generate spectra of accretion disks @xcite based on the standard alpha disk model @xcite .",
    "the standard disk model assumes a geometrically thin axi - symmetric disk , one - dimensional , with a nearly keplerian profile in which the viscosity is due to mhd turbulence .",
    "the density and temperature profiles are function of @xmath6 , and the energy dissipated due to the shear between adjacent rings of matter is radiated locally in the vertical direction ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the disk model consists in dividing the disk into n rings of radii @xmath8 @xmath9 , where the temperature @xmath10 and density @xmath11 of each ring are given by the standard disk model .",
    "the tlusty & synspec codes are then used to generate spectra for the disk rings , given the white dwarf mass , mass accretion rate , and radius of the ring .",
    "the spectra of the rings are then added together to generate a disk spectrum for a given inclination and assuming limb darkening . in the present work we use disk spectra from the grid of solar composition disk spectra generated by @xcite ( assuming lte only ) as well as disk spectra that we generated using both the lte and nlte options for disk rings , as well as in some cases varying the chemical abundances .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure to generate such disk spectra is given by @xcite .",
    "composite models of wd+disk take into account the geometry of the system and account for the visibility of the wd .",
    "for most systems showing ism atomic and molecular hydrogen absorption lines , we identify these lines in the figures to avoid confusing them with the wd lines . for some systems , however , ism lines are deep and broad and some of the wd lines ( such as siv ( 1062.6    & 1073    ) are located at almost the same wavelengths as some of the ism lines .",
    "for that reason , we model the ism lines ; this helps us not only to differentiate between the wd lines and the ism lines , but it improves the overall spectral fit , and provides us with the atomic and molecular column densities .",
    "the ism spectra models are generated using a program developed by one of us ( peb ) .",
    "this program uses a custom spectral fitting package to estimate the temperature and density of the interstellar absorption lines of atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "the ism model assumes that the temperature , bulk velocity , and turbulent velocity of the medium are the same for all atomic and molecular species , whereas the densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen , and the ratios of deuterium to hydrogen and metals ( including helium ) to hydrogen can be adjusted independently .",
    "the model uses atomic data of @xcite and molecular data of @xcite .",
    "the optical depth calculations of molecular hydrogen have been checked against those of @xcite",
    ". the ratios of metals to hydrogen and deuterium to hydrogen are fixed at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , because of the low signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "the wings of the atomic lines are used to estimate the density of atomic hydrogen and the depth of the unsaturated molecular lines for molecular hydrogen .",
    "the temperature and turbulent velocity of the medium are primarily determined from the lines of molecular hydrogen when the ism temperatures are @xmath14 250k .",
    "the ism absorption features are best modeled and displayed when the theoretical ism model ( transmission values ) is combined with a synthetic spectrum for the object ( namely a wd synthetic spectrum , a disk spectrum or a combination of both ) .      before carrying out a synthetic spectral fit , we masked portions of the spectra with strong emission lines , strong ism molecular absorption lines , detector noise and air glow .",
    "these regions of the spectra are somewhat different for each object and are not included in the fitting .",
    "the regions excluded from the fit are in blue in the figures .",
    "the excluded ism quasi - molecular absorption lines are marked with vertical labels in the figures .",
    "after having generated grids of models for each target , we use fit , a @xmath15 minimization routine ( see e.g. @xcite ) , to compute the reduced @xmath16 ( @xmath15 per number of degrees of freedom @xmath17 ) and scale factor values for each model fit . while we use a @xmath15 minimization technique ,",
    "we do not blindly select the least @xmath15 models , but we examine the models that best fit some of the features such as absorption lines and , when possible , the slope of the wings of the broad lyman absorption features .",
    "when possible , we also select the models that are in agreement with the distance of the system ( or its best estimate ) .",
    "the flux level at 1000     ( between ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath18 ) is close to zero for temperatures below 18,000  k ; at 30,000  k it is about 50% of the continuum level at 1100  and it reaches 100% for @xmath19  k. at higher temperature ( @xmath20  k ) the spectrum becomes fairly flat and there is not much difference in the shape of the spectrum between ( say ) a 50,000  k and a 80,000  k model .",
    "when fitting the shape of the spectrum in such a manner , an accuracy of about 500 - 1,000  k is obtained , due to the s / n . in theory , a fine tuning of the temperature ( say to an accuracy of about 50  k ) can be carried out by fitting the flux levels such that the distance to the system ( if known ) is matched .",
    "however , the fitting to the distance depends strongly on the radius ( and therefore the mass ) of the wd . in most of the systems",
    "the mass of the wd and the distance are unknown and therefore the temperature of a system is often accurate to only @xmath21  k. furthermore , since the ly@xmath0 profile depends on both the temperature and gravity of the wd , the accuracy of the solution is sometimes further decreased as there is a small degeneracy in the solution , namely the solution spreads over a small region of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameter space",
    ". and last , reddening values are not always known , therefore increasing even more the uncertainty in assessing the temperature by scaling the synthetic flux to the observed flux . as a consequence , for some targets we may present more than one model fit .",
    "the wd projected rotational velocity ( @xmath4 ) is determined by fitting the wd model to the spectrum while paying careful attention to the line profiles .",
    "we did not carry out separate fits to individual lines but rather tried to fit the lines and continuum in the same fit while paying careful attention to the absorption lines .",
    "for most spectra , when possible , we tried to fit a single wd model , a single disk model , and a composite wd+disk model , assuming different reddening values .",
    "systems that were observed mainly in the low state can usually be modeled just with a wd spectrum , while systems observed in a high state usually require the addition of a disk model . in systems for which the wd mass ( and radius ) is unknown , the distance is estimated using the maximum magnitude / orbital period relation @xcite or , when the period is unknown , we estimate the distance using the secondary infrared emission technique of @xcite .    for the single wd model , we vary the temperature while first keeping the wd mass constant , starting at about @xmath24 .",
    "once the lowest @xmath15 has been found for a given mass , we vary the projected rotational velocity , and possibly also the abundances , to further lower the @xmath15 and obtain a best fit . once the best fit has been found for that mass , we assume a slightly larger mass and again vary the temperature until the lowest @xmath15 is found .",
    "we follow this procedure iteratively until we reach a mass of about @xmath25 .",
    "the next step is to find , from all these lowest @xmath15 models , the one which agrees best with the distance estimate , or the one which has the lowest @xmath15 of all ( if the constraint on the distance can not be used ) . for the single disk model ,",
    "we carry out a similar procedure by varying the mass accretion rate and inclination assuming discrete values of the wd mass , and then choose the least @xmath15 model agreeing best with the distance .",
    "we use a similar procedure for the wd+disk composite modeling to find the best fit model .    in table 6",
    "we list the model fits we carried out for a number of systems .",
    "these appear in the same manner as in the catalog . in the next section we concentrate on a few systems as examples to illustrate the diversity of model fits .",
    "we give here a few examples of systems exhibiting model fits with increasing level of complexity . for the details of the model",
    "fits of all the systems in table 6 , the reader is referred to the references in that table .",
    "the simplest and easiest objects to model are those in which the wd is the sole ( or dominant ) component at very low accretion rates . in that case",
    "the spectrum resembles that of a field wd , with little or no metal lines and with a low stellar rotational rate . this is the case for the pre - cv ( a post - common envelope binary ) v471 tau depicted in figure 1",
    "this eclipsing system has a magnetic wd accreting from the poles at a low accretion rate .",
    "the continuum flux is characterized mainly by the absorption features of the lyman series onto which are superposed a few shallow metal absorption lines .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of v471 tau was obtained as part of a periodic channel coalignment program ( rather than a `` usual '' scientific research go program ) and , as a consequence , the spectrum had to be binned in time in a very specific manner to extract the data obtained only during the good exposure time ( this is described in detail in the next section ) .",
    "this _ fuse _ spectrum has not been modeled previously .",
    "the results of the model fit to the _ fuse _ spectrum are completely consistent with the results obtained from fitting the stis spectrum of the system at longer wavelengths @xcite , namely , the wd has a gravity @xmath26 , a temperature @xmath27  k , sub - solar abundances ( of the order of 1% solar and lower ) and a broadening of the absorption lines corresponding to 250  km  @xmath5 , about a factor of 4 larger than expected , a possible indication that the broadening is due to a weak zeeman effect .    in all the online figures , the flux ( vertical axis ) is given in ergs@xmath28sec@xmath29@xmath30@xmath29 and the wavelength ( horizontal axis ) is given in angstrms (  ) . for clarity all the spectra",
    "are shown on three panels : the upper panel from about 900     to 1000   , the middle panel from about 1000     to 1100   , and the lower panel from about 1100     to 1200   .",
    "air glow emission is annotated above each panel with a `` + '' sign inside a circle .",
    "strong emission lines reaching the upper part of the frame in each panel are marked just above the panel .",
    "the hydrogen series is marked below the x - axis in the upper and middle panel and the hydrogen cut - off limit is clearly marked around 915    with an increasing density of tick marks .",
    "the hei ( 1168   ) line is marked below the lower panel .",
    "when a model is shown , the portions of the observed spectrum that have been masked before the spectral fit are in blue , while the rest of the observed spectrum is in red .",
    "the model fit is shown with a solid black line ( on a white background ) or a solid white line ( on a black background ) .",
    "as the mass accretion rate increases , the wd spectrum becomes more affected by the metal lines .",
    "this is demonstrated in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 2 depicts the _ fuse _ spectrum of the wind accreting wd p831 - 57 .",
    "the model fit has a wd with @xmath31 , @xmath32  k , with @xmath33 solar abundances and a slow rotational velocity .",
    "the details of this model fit are given in @xcite . in figure 3",
    "we show the spectrum of the nova - like mv lyr obtained in its low state , fitted with a solar abundance wd model .",
    "the metal lines are much broader and deeper than in figures 1 & 2 .",
    "the temperature of the wd reaches 45,000  k. one can clearly see , from figures 1 - 3 , how the flux steadily increases in the shorter wavelengths of _ fuse _ as the wd temperature increases .",
    "some cool wd models include the effect of quasi - molecular hi absorption features , in the catalog these are labeled `` q - mol '' in the appropriate figures .    not all the systems exhibit spectra that can be easily modeled as emission lines ( from the sources , or geo- helio- coronal in origin ) and ism absorption lines can also impact the spectrum .",
    "we show such a spectrum in figure 4 for the symbiotic binary ae ara . in the figures in the online catalog , neutral oxygen lines ( when present )",
    "are shown with an arrow `` oi @xmath34 '' ; if many ( ism ) oi lines are present , they are just annotated with vertical tick marks in the lower portion of each panel .",
    "ism molecular hydrogen lines are either individually annotated vertically ( e.g. l10r1 , as in figure 4 ) or just marked with an arrow `` mh @xmath34 '' and vertical tick marks ( usually in the upper part of each panel ) .",
    "features resulting from fixed pattern noise introduced by _ fuse _ detectors are indicated with `` fpn '' .    as a more complex example , we choose the _ fuse _ spectrum of the dwarf nova ( z cam ) system em cyg , which is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the data were obtained in quiescence and consists of four exposures taken at different binary orbital phase .",
    "we modeled the exposure obtained when absorption was minimal , corresponding to the wd facing the observer .",
    "the s / n of a single exposure is rather low and the spectrum is also affected by ism absorption .",
    "this system is dominated by emission from the wd but a best fit is obtained with the inclusion of a low mass accretion disk model ( see figure 5 ) and ism molecular absorption curtain . in the catalog , as in figure 5 , the disk model and the wd model are shown respectively with dashed- and dotted lines .    as a last example",
    ", we choose the ux uma nova - like variable v3885 sgr observed in a high state , shown in figure 6 .",
    "this _ fuse _ spectrum is different than the ones shown in the previous figures , and it is characteristic of systems accreting at a high accretion rate .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by a continuum flux extending to the shortest wavelengths of _ fuse _ , where the lyman series absorption features are not as obvious as in the previous spectra due mainly to keplerian rotational broadening . in addition , broad , deep , and blue - shifted absorption lines of highly ionized species ( such as niv , svi , ovi , .. ; see figure 6 ) , are indicative of a hot corona forming above the disk or boundary layer(bl ) . the sharp absorption lines of hi are of interstellar origin .",
    "systems in high states are modeled mainly with an accretion disk with a large @xmath35 including the contribution from a hot wd , which usually does not contribute much to the overall flux . here",
    "we improve the disk model , by including the contribution of the bl to the theoretical spectra .",
    "we replace the inner disk rings with hot rings matching the temperature of the bl @xmath36k .",
    "we built different bl models , consisting of 1 , 2 , 3 or more rings assuming different ring temperatures ranging between 100,000k and 200,000k .",
    "we generated models consisting of all the possible combinations of bl + disk + wd , over a wide range of parameters keeping the assumption the bl luminosity should not exceed the disk luminosity .",
    "we then apply our least @xmath15 fitting routine after we masked all the sharp ism lines and the broad emission lines which are all blue - shifted by @xmath12   ( an indication that they form in a corona above the emitting component ) . the final ( best ) model is found based not only on the the least @xmath15 value , but also by checking which ( least @xmath15 ) model agrees best with the distance , white dwarf mass , inclination , and mass accretion rate ( if and when these are known ) . the best model to the _ fuse _ spectrum of v3885 sgr",
    "consists of a 0.7@xmath37 wd with a temperature of 60,000k wd , 200km / s , a disk inclined at 60@xmath38 with @xmath39/yr , and a bl with a temperature of 175,000k ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we note that a hot wd and a high @xmath35 disk also provide a satisfactory fit @xcite , but in order to match the flux in the shorter wavelengths of _ fuse _ one needs to include the boundary layer .",
    "we are now implementing disk models with the inclusion of a realistic boundary layer to improve the modeling of such systems in the high state . in the _ fuse _ spectral range",
    ", one has to include mainly the hottest components of the system , namely the wd , the boundary ( or spread ) layer , and the accretion disk .",

    "dt aps was observed twice with _ fuse _ , but only the second _ fuse _ spectrum shows a continuum .",
    "this low s / n spectrum is heavily affected by air glow , especially at the shorter wavelengths . the deep absorption feature ( 1110 - 1130   ) is probably due to an incorrect background subtraction ( as is probably the ciii feature ) .",

    "the broad lines of ciii ( 977 & 1175 ) and ovi are from the source . in the longer wavelengths of _ fuse _ the theoretical and observed spectra match each other in some regions but not everywhere .",
    "for example the siv has an observed flux lower than modeled at 1123  , while at the bottom of the broad absorption feature at 1128  there is a small sharp emission feature most probably due to the low s / n .",
    "these lines are identified by their location and the by the overall shape of the continuum in their immediate neighborhood .",

    "the ciii ( 977 & 1175 ) and ovi lines are seen each in absorption on top of a broader emission feature . the only lines that we identified in absorption ( and are also deeper than in the model ) are siv ( 1073 ) , siiii ( @xmath11110 ) and siiv ( 1123 & 1128 ) .",
    "the other lines that are usually observed are marked on the figure but are not identified .",
    "the model spectrum consists of a wd+disk .",
    "the wd component contributes 93% of the flux , the disk contributes the remaining 7% .",
    "some absorption lines can not be accounted for and are possibly due to veiling of the wd from the l1 stream material flowing over the disk to smaller radius at different orbital phases .",
    "maximum veiling is around orbital phase 0.6 - 0.9 .",
    "all the details of the processing of the _ fuse _ spectra and their analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "es dra was observed in an intermediate state and it is not clear whether the main component is a wd or a disk , as the inclination and wd mass of the system are not known . because of that , the _ fuse _ spectrum of es dra is modeled first with a single wd , and then with a disk alone .",
    "we do not consider any wd+disk model , as there is a degeneracy of the solution ( there are many wd+disk models that can fit this spectrum covering a large area in the parameter space ) .",

    "ciii ( 977 & 1175 ) and the ovi doublet are characterized by a shallow absorption on top of a braoder emission .",
    "the oxygen doublet also exhibits a narrow emission slightly red shifted . the atomic hydrogen and oxygen narrow absorption lines are from the ism , and so are the cii ( 1036 & 1037 ) and nitrogen lines ( though some of the nitrogen lines could be contaminated from the terrestrial atmosphere ) .",
