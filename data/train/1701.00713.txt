    ", one should be able to access the materials from those lectures from anywhere in the world , so a text transcribing them is not really needed .",
    "instead , i will try to spend more time on points that perhaps require too much notation for a broadly aimed series of talks , but which should ease the transition to reading detailed lecture notes like @xcite .",
    "the fields from the title are vast and they intersect in many different ways . here",
    "we will talk about a particular meeting point , the progress at which in the time since seattle i find exciting enough to report in salt lake city .",
    "the advances both in the subject matter itself , and in my personal understanding of it , owe a lot to m.  aganagic , r.  bezrukavnikov , p.  etingof , d.  maulik , n.  nekrasov , and others , as will be clear from the narrative .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the basic question in representation theory is to describe the homomorphisms @xmath0 and the geometric representation theory aims to describe the source , the target , the map itself , or all of the above , geometrically .",
    "for example , matrices may be replaced by correspondences , by which we mean cycles in @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an algebraic variety , or k - theory classes on @xmath1 et cetera . these form algebras with respect to convolution and act on cycles in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "indeed , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a ring , is nothing but @xmath6 where @xmath2 is a finite set of cardinality @xmath7 , and the usual rules of linear algebra , when written in terms of pullback , product , and pushforward , apply universally .",
    "( this is also how e.g.  integral operators act . )",
    "most of the time , these can and should be upgraded to fourier - mukai kernels @xcite , although doing this in the enumerative context should be weighted against the cost of losing deformation invariance  a highly prized and constantly used property of pragmatically defined geometric counts .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    there is some base ring implicit in and , in real life , this ring is usually @xmath8 or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a reductive group acting on @xmath2 although , of course , generalizations are possible .    in",
    "what follows , it will be natural and important to work with the maximal equivariance allowed by the problem . among their many advantages ,",
    "equivariant counts are often defined when nonequivariant are nt .",
    "concretely , the character of an infinite - dimensional module @xmath11 may be well - defined as a rational function on @xmath10 , but @xmath12 will typically be a pole of this function .",
    "[ [ s_cm ] ]    enumerative geometry is an endless source of interesting correspondences of the following kind . the easiest way for two distant points @xmath13 to interact is to lie on a curve @xmath14 of some degree and genus and , perhaps , additionally constrained by e.g.  incidence to a fixed cycle in @xmath2 . leaving the exact notion of a curve vague for a moment",
    ", one can contemplate a moduli space @xmath15 of two - pointed curves in @xmath2 with an evaluation map @xmath16 one can use this evaluation map to construct correspondences given , informally , by pairs of points @xmath17 that lie on such and such curve . for this , one needs geometrically natural cycles or k - classes on @xmath15 to push forward and , indeed , these are available in some generality .",

    "the number of equations they have to satisfy , one computes @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the genus of a curve @xmath21 , @xmath22 is its degree , and @xmath23 is the number of marked points .",
    "this is only a lower bound for the actual dimension of @xmath15 and it is seldom correct .",
    "enumerative geometers treat this as they would treat any excess intersection problem : redundant equations still cut out a canonical cycle class @xmath24_{\\textup{vir}}$ ] of the correct dimension , known as the _ virtual fundamental cycle _ , see @xcite .",
    "there is a parallel construction of the virtual structure sheaf @xmath25 , see @xcite .",
    "as we deform @xmath2 , the moduli spaces @xmath15 may jump wildly , but the curve counts constructed using @xmath24_{\\textup{vir}}$ ] and @xmath26 do not change .    it will seem like a small detail now , but a certain symmetrized version @xmath27 of the virtual structure sheaf has improved self - duality properties and links better with both representation theory and mathematical physics .",
    "the square - root factor in is the square root of the virtual canonical bundle , which exists in special circumstances @xcite .",
    "the importance of such twist in enumerative k - theory was emphasized by nekrasov @xcite , the rationale being that for khler manifolds the twist by a square root of the canonical bundle turns the dolbeault operator into the dirac operator .",

    "rich may be defined pragmatically as allowing for computations or proofs .",
    "this is exactly the same as being able to place the evolution operator of a quantum - mechanical or field - theoretic problem into a rich algebra of operators acting on its hilbert space .",
    "a mathematical physicist would call this phenomenon _ integrability_. nekrasov and shatashvili @xcite were to first to suggest , in the equivalent language of supersymmetric gauge theories , that the enumerative problems discussed here are integrable .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    my personal intuition is that there are much fewer `` rich '' algebras than there are interesting algebraic varieties , which means there has to be something very special about @xmath2 to have a real link between curve - counting in @xmath2 and representation theory . in any case",
    ", the progress in enumerative geometry that will be described in these lectures is restricted to certain very special algebraic varieties .",
    "ten years ago in seattle , kaledin already spoke about _ equivariant symplectic resolutions _ , see @xcite and section [ s_sympl_res ] , and the importance of this class of algebraic varieties has been only growing since .",
    "in particular , it was understood by bezrukavnikov and his collaborators that the geometry of rational curves in an equivariant symplectic resolution @xmath2 is tightly intertwined with the geometric structures described in @xcite and , specifically , with the derived autoequivalences of @xmath2 and the representation theory of its quantization .",
    "i find it remarkable that here one makes contact with a very _ different _ interpretation of what it means for to be geometric .",

    "quantization _ of a symplectic algebraic variety @xmath2 and this very much ties @xmath30-modules with coherent sheaves on @xmath2 .",
    "we denote this noncommutative algebra @xmath30 partly to avoid confusion with some algebra @xmath31 acting on @xmath2 by correspondences but , in fact , in this subject , algebras of both kinds often trade places ! this means that @xmath31 turns out to be related to a quantization of some @xmath32 , and vice versa .",
    "dualities of this kind originate in supersymmetic gauge theories and are known under various names there , see e.g.@xcite , mathematicians call them _ symplectic duality _ following @xcite , see also @xcite . perhaps at the next summer institute",
    "someone will present a definite treatment of these dualities .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the relation between rational curves in @xmath2 and representation theory of @xmath30 will be explained in due course below ; for now , one can note that perhaps a link between enumerative geometry and representation theory exists for a class of varieties which is at least as large and about as special as equivariant symplectic resolutions .",
    "prototypical examples of equivariant symplectic resolutions are the cotangent bundles @xmath33 of projective homogeneous spaces was sorted out in @xcite .",
    "arguably , it is even simpler than the beautiful story we have for @xmath34 itself . ] .",
    "perhaps equivariant symplectic resolutions form the right generalization of semisimple lie algebras for the needs of today s mathematics ?    while equivariant symplectic resolutions await cartan and killing of the present day to classify them , the largest and richest class of equivariant symplectic resolutions known to date is formed by nakajima quiver varieties @xcite .",
    "these are associated to a quiver , which means a finite graph with possibly loops and multiple edges .",
    "quivers generalize dynkin diagrams ( but the meaning of multiple edges is different ) . from their very beginning",
    ", nakajima varieties played a important role in geometric representation theory ; that role has been only growing since .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    geometers particularly like nakajima varieties associated to affine ade quivers , because they are moduli of framed sheaves on the corresponding ade surfaces . in particular , hilbert schemes of points of ade surfaces are nakajima varieties . by definition ,",
    "a map @xmath35 where @xmath18 is a curve and @xmath36 is a surface , is the same as a 1-dimensional subscheme of @xmath37 , flat over @xmath18 , and similarly for other moduli of sheaves on @xmath36 .",
    "this is the prosaic basic link between curves in affine ade nakajima varieties and the enumerative geometry of sheaves on threefolds , known as the donaldson - thomas theory . to be symplectic in order for the above correspondence to remain uncorrected enumeratively in cohomology .",
    "a further degree of precision is required in k - theory .",
    "] we are primarily interested in 1-dimensional sheaves on @xmath38 , and we will often refer to them as curves . and the corresponding curves in @xmath38 .",
    "the source @xmath18 in is a _ fixed _ curve , and from the enumerative point of view , it may be taken to be a union of rational components .",
    "the `` curves '' in @xmath38 being enumerated can be as arbitrary @xmath39-dimensional sheaves as our moduli spaces allow . ]",
    "other nakajima varieties resemble moduli spaces of sheaves on a symplectic surface  they can be interpreted as moduli of stable objects in certain 2-dimensional calabi - yau categories .",
    "correspondingly , enumerative geometry of curves in nakajima varieties has to do with counting stable objects in 3-dimensional categories , and so belongs to the donaldson - thomas theory in the broad sense .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    to avoid a misunderstanding , a threefold @xmath38 does not need to be calabi - yau to have an interesting enumerative geometry or enumerative k - theory of sheaves .",
    "calabi - yau threefolds are certainly distinguished from many points of view , but from the perspective of dt counts , either in cohomology or in k - theory , the geometry of curves in the good old projective space is at least as interesting .",
    "in fact , certain levels of complexity in the theory collapse under the calabi - yau assumption .",
    "when @xmath38 is fibered over a curve in ade surfaces , its dt theory theory may be directly linked to curves in the corresponding nakajima variety .",
    "while this is certainly a very narrow class of threefolds , it captures the essential information about dt counts in all threefolds in the following sense .",
    "any threefold , together with curve counts in it , may be glued out of certain model pieces , and these model pieces are captured by the ade fibrations ( in fact , it is enough to take only @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 surfaces ) .",
    "this may be compared with chern - simons theory of real threefolds : that theory also has pieces , described by the representation theory of the corresponding loop group or quantum group at a root of unity , which have to be glued to obtain invariants .",
    "the algebraic version of breaking up a threefold @xmath38 we need here is the following .",
    "assume that @xmath38 may be degenerated , with a smooth total space of the deformation , to a transverse union @xmath43 of two smooth threefolds along a smooth divisor @xmath44 .",
    "then , on the one hand , degeneration formula of li and wu @xcite gives the curve counts in @xmath38 in terms of counts in @xmath45 and @xmath46 that also record the _ relative _ information at the divisor @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "levine and pandharipande prove @xcite that the relation @xmath47 = \\left[y_1\\right ]   +   \\left[y_2\\right ] -   \\left[{\\mathbb{p}}({\\mathscr{o}}_d\\oplus n_{y_1/d})\\right ] \\label{algcob}\\ ] ] generates all relations of the algebraic cobordism , and so , in particular , any projective @xmath38 may be linked to a product of projective spaces by a sequence of such degenerations[multiblock footnote omitted ] .    if @xmath38 is toric , e.g.  a product of projective spaces , then equivariant localization may be used to break up curve counts into further pieces and those are all captured by @xmath48 geometries , see @xcite .",
    "[ [ shopf ] ]    nakajima varieties @xmath2 are special even among equivariant symplectic resolutions , in the following sense .",
    "the algebras @xmath31 acting by correspondences on @xmath2 are , in fact , _ hopf algebras _ , which means that there is a coproduct , that is , an algebra homomorphism @xmath49 a counit @xmath50 , and an antipode , satisfying standard axioms ( a certain completion may be needed for infinite - dimensional @xmath31 ) . more abstractly , these mean that the category @xmath51 has    * a tensor product @xmath52 , which need _ not _ be commutative , * a trivial representation , given by @xmath53 , which is identity for @xmath52 , * left and right duals , compatible with @xmath52 .",
    "the notion of a tensor category is , of course , very familiar to algebraic geometers , except possibly for the part that allows for @xmath54 this noncommutativity is what separates representation theory of _ quantum groups _ from representation theory of usual groups .",
    "representation - theorists know that a mild noncommutativity makes a tensor category even more constrained and allows for an easier reconstruction of @xmath31 from @xmath55 , see e.g.  @xcite for an excellent exposition .",

    "in the elliptic theory , walls become poles and all alcoves melt into a single elliptic function .",
    "the only remaining discrete data is the choice of a cone @xmath91 , and the choice of the ample cone in @xmath525 if one thinks about all flops of @xmath2 at the same time .",
    "note that this data is now symmetric on the two sides of the symplectic duality .",
    "a categorical lift of elliptic stable envelopes along the lines of should incorporate their dependence on the khler variables @xmath183 together with the elliptic modulus @xmath219 .",
    "a few paragraphs ago we discussed adding such extra variables formally . a real need to incorporate these variables",
    "arises in certain categories of boundary conditions , see @xcite for a general introduction to the topic .",
    "recall that the nakajima varieties may be interpreted as the higgs branches of the moduli spaces of vacua in certain supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "k - theoretic counts of quasimaps @xmath526 , where @xmath18 is a riemann surface , may then be interpreted as supersymmetric indices in 3-dimensional gauge theories with spacetime @xmath527 .",
    "a boundary condition in such theory is a coupling of the bulk gauge theory to some @xmath528-supersymmetric theory on @xmath529 .",
    "the hilbert space of the boundary theory is graded by @xmath530 together with the action of @xmath219 by rotations of @xmath531 .",
    "these hilbert spaces form a sheaf over @xmath2 and taking their graded index one gets an element of @xmath532 $ ] which represents the @xmath219-expansion of an elliptic function .",
    "this is how elliptic stable envelopes should appear from a functor @xmath533 as will be discussed in @xcite .",
    "while the monodromy of a differential equation gives a representation of the fundamental group of its regular locus , the monodromy of a @xmath219-difference equation in @xmath183 is a collection of elliptic matrices in @xmath183 that relate different fundamental solutions .",
    "in particular , @xmath219-connections with regular singularities on a toric variety produce elliptic connection matrices for any pair of fixed points . for us , those are labeled by a pair of birational symplectic resolutions @xmath2 for the khler @xmath219-connection or by a pair of cones in @xmath235 for the equivariant @xmath219-connection .",
    "this difference in how monodromy packages the information is parallel to the differences highlighted in section [ s_ell1 ] and , in fact , elliptic stable envelopes give a very powerful tool for the analysis of the monodromy .",
    "recall from section [ s_jointly ] that the khler and equivariant connections are regular separately but not jointly .",
    "this can never happen for differential equations by a deep result of deligne @xcite , but can happen very easily for @xmath219-difference equations as illustrated by the following system : @xmath534 this proves to be a feature and not a bug , for the following reason .",
    "let @xmath535 be the origin in the khler moduli space for @xmath2 and choose a point @xmath536 on the infinity of the equivariant torus .",
    "quasimap counting produces solutions of both khler and equivariant equations known as _",
    "vertex functions _ , or i - functions in the mirror symmetry vernacular .",
    "these are born as power series in @xmath183 , the terms in which record the contribution of quasimaps of different degrees . in particular ,",
    "vertex functions are _ holomorphic _ in @xmath183 in a punctured neighborhood of @xmath537 . however",
    ", they have _ poles _ in @xmath100 accumulating to @xmath538 .    we can call these the @xmath183-solutions , and there are the dual @xmath100-solutions that are holomorphic in a punctured neighborhood of @xmath538 .",
    "the connection matrix between the @xmath183-solutions and the @xmath100-solutions is an elliptic matrix in both @xmath183 and @xmath100",
    ". it may be called the _ pole subtraction _ matrix because it may be , in principle , computed by canceling the unwanted poles .",
    "it may be compared to a monodromy matrix , or to a stokes matrix , except there is no analytic continuation involved , or sectors .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite is the identification of pole subtraction matrices with stable envelopes .",
    "note they depend on the same discrete data , namely a choice of @xmath539 , and act in the direction @xmath540 k - theories in the source and the target of are naturally identified with initial conditions for @xmath100-solutions and @xmath183-solutions , respectively .",
    "we recall that khler difference equations depend not only on @xmath2 but also on a presentation of @xmath2 as a nakajima variety .",
    "in particular , even if @xmath99 is a bunch of points , its khler difference equation may still be a nontrivial abelian difference equation . as a result , even through elliptic stable envelopes depend on @xmath2 only , the monodromy depends on its quiver presentation .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite is the identification of the categorical stable envelopes with the parabolic induction functors for the quantizations under the derived equivalences . in particular , in the case",
    "@xmath542 , this gives a complete control on the action of the triangles in k - theory and thus lets one proof the conjectures of section [ s_bez ] in the case of isolated fixed points .",
