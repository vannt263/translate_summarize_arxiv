    "the velocity widths of lines of low - ionization species were derived following the prescriptions of @xcite . with our enlarged sample of sub - dlas , it can be seen that _ sub - dlas also exhibit a correlation between the velocity widths and metallicities over the same range of @xmath95 as dlas _ ( kendall s tau probability of 0.016% ) , but with a slightly larger scatter than dlas and offset to higher metallicities by @xmath96  dex at a given @xmath93 ( see the linear least - square bisector fits ) .",

    "metallicity relation amongst galaxies at @xmath98 , @xcite proposed that sub - dlas arise in more massive galaxies than dlas . with the new data presented in this letter ,",
    "this interpretation encounters a number of problems .",
    "the _ first _ problem is directly related to the main argument that led @xcite to link sub - dlas to massive galaxies , namely the mass    metallicity relation and the velocity width    metallicity relation .",
    "if the velocity width of lines of low - ionization species in the velocity width    metallicity relation of @xcite is a proxy for mass and sub - dlas are associated mostly with massive galaxies , we expect sub - dlas to exhibit almost exclusively large velocity widths . as discussed above and illustrated in fig .",

    "the plot on the right - bottom corner shows the cumulative functions of the @xmath992796 ew distributions of sub - dlas ( thin line ) and dlas ( thick line).,height=294 ]    the _ second _ difficulty with the identification of sub - dlas with massive galaxies is to reconcile their metallicity evolution with the now popular scenario of ` down - sizing ' . in this paradigm ,",
    "massive galaxies build up their stellar mass and metals at earlier epochs than lower mass galaxies and already are relatively metal - rich by @xmath100 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "contrary to what is expected of massive galaxies , sub - dlas are fairly metal - poor at high redshifts and only develop their metallicities at @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ metallicity - evolution ] ) .",
    "moreover , the relative rates of sub - dla and dla metallicity evolution are inconsistent with a simple division in mass ( see e.g. figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , when splitting our full sample of sub - dlas plus dlas by their velocity width ( and not their @xmath76 ( ) ) , we observe at high redshifts , @xmath101 , that systems with @xmath97 km  s@xmath73 have higher metallicities ( @xmath102}\\rangle = -1.29\\pm 0.07 $ ] ) than systems with @xmath103 km  s@xmath73 ( @xmath102}\\rangle = -1.53\\pm 0.18 $ ] ) . the ks test shows that the null - hypothesis that the metallicities of these two sub - samples of absorbers at @xmath101 are drawn from the same population can be rejected with confidence at 99.9991% c.l .",
    "this result is in line with the expectations of both the down - sizing picture and the velocity width as a proxy for mass also supported by the recent simulations of @xcite .",
    "neither sub - dlas nor dlas appear as the dominant feature of the sub - sample of absorbers at @xmath101 with @xmath97 km  s@xmath73 or the sub - sample of absorbers at @xmath101 with @xmath104 km  s@xmath73 : the former ( the latter ) sub - sample is composed of 22% ( 19% ) sub - dlas and 78% ( 81% ) dlas .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath76 ( ) limit between sub - dlas and dlas is not simply due to a distinction in mass .",
    "the _ third _ objection to the massive galaxy hypothesis is the slope of the metallicity evolution of sub - dlas which appears to be much steeper than that of luminous ( massive ) star - forming galaxies at @xmath105 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and see the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ metallicity - evolution ] ) .    finally , the _ fourth _ inconsistency in connecting sub - dlas with massive galaxies is that they outnumber dlas by a factor of up to 8 , whereas massive galaxies are far less common than low mass galaxies .",
    "even when assuming that only the most metal - rich sub - dlas arise in massive galaxies , at @xmath1 more than 70% of sub - dlas have [ zn / h ] metallicities @xmath106 solar and hence lead to a too large proportion of massive galaxies .",
    "although massive gas - rich galaxies may have a higher absorption cross - section , @xcite have shown that in the local universe the number density of dlas is still dominated by sub-@xmath107 galaxies .",
    "so , how can the high metallicities of the low - redshift sub - dlas be explained ? it has often been suggested that dust in the higher column density dlas leads to an observed distribution of metallicities that is biased towards low values .",
    "indeed , if dust extinction is a strong function of the metal column density as observed in interstellar medium clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the metal - rich dlas may be more affected by dust selection than metal - rich sub - dlas @xcite .",
    "such an effect could make dlas appear less metal - rich than sub - dlas .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that would be required to explain the @xmath108  dex difference in metallicity between the low - redshift sub - dlas and dlas .",
    "most recently , @xcite found that dust depletions in @xmath109 sub - dlas and dlas in the complete optical and radio absorption line system ( corals ) survey are consistent with magnitude limited samples .",
    "can large - scale physical differences account for the metallicity differences between low - redshift sub - dlas and dlas ?",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that for a given mass , galaxies are more metal - rich if they have smaller half - light radii or lower specific star formation rates .",
    "@xcite have also shown that galaxies in dense environments have slightly higher metallicities . however , the metallicity offsets for both effects are far too small ( @xmath110  dex ) to explain the differences between sub - dlas and dlas we observe .",
    "what about photoionization effects ?",
    "the lower column densities of sub - dlas may imply that the neutral hydrogen is partially ionized , in which case the observed to ratio may not be a robust measure of the total [ fe / h ] abundance .",
    "the magnitude of these corrections is quite sensitive to the ionizing background , leading to some variation amongst results in the literature @xcite .",
    "substantial ionization corrections are , however , certainly needed in some sub - dlas .",
    "the larger difference between the median @xmath76 ( ) of sub - dlas and dlas at low than high redshifts ( ) of sub - dlas and dlas is 1.04  dex ( 0.76  dex ) at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) with the median @xmath14 ( ) of sub - dlas being equal to 19.81 ( 19.94 ) . ] and the change in the shape of the ionizing background between @xmath111 and @xmath0 , also raises the possibility that the typical ionization corrections for sub - dlas may be higher at @xmath1 than @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is currently no strong evidence to support this as an explanation for the much steeper evolution of sub - dla metallicities . in general , ionization corrections in sub - dlas",
    "are similar when calculated with a haardt - madau spectrum at both @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( milutinovic , private communication ) and @xcite found corrections that are typically @xmath113 0.2 dex for their low - redshift sub - dlas .    having ruled out physically related sources of bias ( dust , environment , and ionization corrections ) , we consider systematics associated with the selection and analysis of low - redshift sub - dlas .",
    "this is additionally motivated by our finding that the sub - dlas only show significant enhancement in [ fe / h ] at redshifts that require hst observations of the ly@xmath114 line . @xcite",
    "have investigated possible systematic uncertainties in the column density determinations of sub - dlas from low - resolution spectra in comparison to high - resolution spectra .",

    "next , we consider the process through which the majority of our low - redshift sub - dlas were identified : the equivalent width ( ew ) selection .",
    "most of the low - redshift sub - dlas in both this study and the literature come from compilations of sub - dlas that have been obtained as a ` by - product ' of low - redshift dla searches .",

    "this offset can be explained in terms of kinematics . @xcite and @xcite showed that ( low - redshift ) sub - dlas have higher velocity widths for a given ew than dlas ( parameterized by the @xmath117-index ) . since we have already shown that @xmath93 is correlated with metallicity in sub - dlas ( fig .",
