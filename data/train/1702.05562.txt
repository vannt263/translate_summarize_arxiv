    "have also been identified @xcite . since cbds can act as mass reservoirs to the protostellar binaries , observational studies of internal structures and gas motions in cbds are crucial to understand how protostellar binaries grow , and how their final masses and mass ratios are determined .    in cbds , tidal torques by orbiting protostellar binaries can clear the material and create gaps within the disks . at the same time , the non - axisymmetric gravitational potential from the binary ( i.e. , roche potential ) , induces both inward and outward gas motions with slower and faster rotations respectively , as compared to the standard keplerian rotations .",
    "this results in spiral density patterns in the cbds .",
    "previous theoretical studies of cbds around protostellar binaries predict such spiral - arm structures and non - axisymmetric rotating and infalling gas motions @xcite .",
    "observational identifications of such spiral - arm features and infalling motions toward the protostellar binaries in the cbds , are essential to understand the growth mechanism of protostellar binaries .",
    "it is also important to measure the gas distribution and gas motions between the cbd and csds , in order to understand the transfer of material from the cbd to the csds .",
    "our group has been conducting a series of sma , aste , and alma studies of the class i protostellar binary l1551 ne , located in the l1551 region at a distance @xmath11=140 pc @xcite .",

    "our alma cycle 0 observations of l1551 ne at a @xmath50@xmath47 resolution , resolved the structure of the cbd and separated the cbd and the two csds . in the c@xmath0o ( 32 )",
    "emission , deviations of the gas motion from the keplerian rotation in the cbd are also identified . to compare with our data",
    ", we produced model alma cycle 0 images from our hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the simulated images show that the observed cbd structures can be interpreted as two spiral arms , and that the observed gas motions can be interpreted as expanding and infalling gas motions in the arm and inter - arm regions , respectively .",
    "this is because gravitational torques from the central binary system impart angular momenta to the spiral - arm regions and extract angular momenta from the inter - arm regions .",
    "however , the cycle 0 resolution was still too coarse to fully characterize the spiral - arm structures , the gas motions within the spiral - arm and inter - arm regions , and within the circumstellar disks . here , we present our alma cycle 2 observations of l1551 ne at a @xmath54-times higher spatial resolution , as compared to the cycle 0 observations . in section 2 of the present paper",
    ", we describe our experiment , the data reduction and imaging , and our numerical simulations to be compared with the observed features . in section 3 , we present the results on the 0.9-mm dust - continuum and c@xmath0o ( @xmath17=32 ) emission .",
    "we have successfully resolved the spiral structures of the cbd and identified gas motions in the spiral - arm and inter - arm regions .",
    "we have also resolved the structure of the individual csds and identified the gas motions in the csds . in section 4 ,",
    "we present physical interpretations of the observed features , and the related issues of studies of protostellar binaries . section 5",
    "provides a concise summary of our main results and discussion .",
    "our alma observations of l1551 ne were made on 2015 june 27 .",
    "four molecular lines in band 7 , that is , the c@xmath0o ( @xmath17=3 - 2 ; 329.3305453 ghz ) , the @xmath1co ( @xmath17=3 - 2 ; 330.587965 ghz ) , the so ( @xmath18=7@xmath2 - 6@xmath3 ; 340.71416 ghz ) , and the cs ( @xmath17=7 - 6 ; 342.882857 ghz ) lines , as well as the 0.9-mm dust - continuum emission , were observed simultaneously .",
    "the precipitable water in the atmosphere was @xmath50.55  0.61 mm , an excellent condition during the band 7 observations . excluding overheads for calibration ,",
    "the total time on source was 34 minutes .",
    "table [ obs ] summarizes the observational parameters .",
    "the number of the available antennae was 36 , but due to the correlator problem it was 35 for the so and cs lines as well as the corresponding continuum .",
    "the c34 - 7/(6 ) configuration was adopted , which provides the minimum and maximum baseline lengths of 33.7 m and 1.6 km , respectively .",
    "the projected baseline length on the source ranges from 29 m to 1575 m. the minimum projected baseline length implies that the present alma observation can recover @xmath550@xmath10 of the peak flux for a gaussian emission distribution with a fwhm of @xmath52@xmath48 ( @xmath5390 au ) , and @xmath510@xmath10 with a fwhm of @xmath55@xmath42 ( @xmath5730 au ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the present alma observation is sensitive to the structures of the cbd with its outermost radius of @xmath5300 au ( @xmath52@xmath41 ) around l1551 ne , while largely insensitive to its surrounding envelope structures with the outermost extent of @xmath1920000 au ( @xmath5143@xmath20 ) @xcite .    in its frequency division mode ( fdm ) ,",
    "the alma correlator was configured to provide four independent spectral windows ( basebands ) , each having a bandwidth of 468.75 mhz and one of the four observed molecular lines .",
    "the spectral window for the c@xmath0o line was divided into 3840 channels , with each channel having a width of 122.07 khz .",
    "hanning smoothing was applied to the spectral channels , resulting in a frequency resolution of 244.14 khz and hence a velocity resolution of 0.22 km s@xmath21 for the c@xmath0o line . due to the limitation of the incoming data rate , the number of spectral channels and hence the frequency resolution , had to be degraded by a factor of 2 and 4 for the other spectral windows .",
    "the resultant velocity resolutions are 0.44 km s@xmath21 , 0.86 km s@xmath21 , and 0.85 km s@xmath21 for the @xmath1co , so , and the cs lines , respectively . in the following",
    ", we will use the higher - resolution c@xmath0o line to discuss the velocity structures of the cbd and csds in l1551 ne .",
    "channels in all four spectral windows , which are devoid of line emission , were used to create the continuum image , which has a central frequency of 335.85 ghz (= 0.893 mm ) and a total bandwidth of 1.845 ghz .",
    "calibration of the raw visibility data was performed by the alma observatory through the pipeline using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) version 4.2.2 .",
    "the quasar j0510 + 180 , with estimated flux of @xmath52.4 jy , was adopted as the gain and absolute flux calibrators .",
    "the quasar j0423 - 0120 was adopted as the passband calibrator .",
    "we checked the tables of the pipeline calibration as well as the calibrated visibility data .",
    "we confirmed that the calibration was fine except for the presence of one integration of l1551 ne with unreasonably high amplitudes , which we flagged manually before the imaging process .",
    "we did not perform self - calibration , since the signal - to - noise ratio of the present alma data is high .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were then fourier - transformed and cleaned to create the continuum and molecular - line images .",
    "for the molecular line imaging , natural weighting of the visibility data was adopted to enhance sensitivity . for the continuum imaging , various weighting of the visibility data",
    "were tried . the continuum image with the natural weighting",
    "is used to investigate the structures of the cbd .",
    "the continuum images with uniform weighting , and with restriction of baselines longer than 450 m , resulted in higher resolutions , were used to resolve and study the structures of the csds .",

    "as described below , in our new cycle 2 image of the 0.9-mm continuum emission , it is clear that the western part is much brighter than the eastern part .",
    "such a one - sided , non - point - symmetric distribution of materials , is regarded as an @xmath6 mode , which is distinct from an @xmath22 mode of two identical spiral arms .",
    "our numerical simulation shows that after @xmath520 orbital periods such an @xmath6 mode is well - developed and is present continuously until the end of the simulation ( @xmath5250 orbital periods ) .",
    "this @xmath6 mode has not been explicitly reported in the previous theoretical simulations of cbds @xcite , but its presence in the observed alma image as well as in our long - term numerical simulation , suggests its ubiquity .",
    "here , we have adopted the simulation result at the 73rd orbital period of the binary , which appears to best resemble the observed 0.9-mm dust - continuum image .",
    "the output from the numerical simulation was transferred to the radiative transfer calculations , and the theoretically predicted 0.9-mm dust - continuum and c@xmath0o ( 32 ) images were constructed on the assumptions of the lte condition .",
    "details of the radiative transfer calculations are also described by takakuwa et al .",
    "we then performed casa observing simulations and created simulated visibility data for the model images with the same antenna configuration , hour angle coverage , bandwidth and frequency resolution , and integration time as those of the real observation .",

    "the mass of the infalling component is estimated to be @xmath95 @xmath58.1@xmath710@xmath96 @xmath16 .",
    "then , the mass infalling rate ( @xmath97 ) can be estimated as @xmath98 and the value is @xmath991.0@xmath710@xmath100 @xmath101 . from @xmath102 the accretion luminosity ( @xmath103 ) can also be calculated as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the gravitational constant , @xmath106 is a mass of the central protostar , and @xmath107 is the terminal radius of the infall .",
    "if we assume that the infalling gas directly reaches to the surface of the protostar ( i.e. , @xmath107 = @xmath108 = 4@xmath109 ) @xcite , the accretion luminosity is @xmath55.4 @xmath14 , similar to the bolometric luminosity of l1551 ne (= 4.2 @xmath14 ; froebrich 2005 ) . in the above estimates , we simply extracted the c@xmath0o emission with the east ( red ) to west ( blue ) velocity gradient in the vicinity of source a , since the velocity gradient along the minor axis can be interpreted as an infalling motion . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not straightforward to observationally identify infalling motions along the disk major axis , because the radial motion along the major axis does not have any velocity vector along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "thus , the mass infalling rate estimated above should be regarded as the lower limit of the entire infall toward source a. toward source b , our alma observations do not identify infalling motions ( i.e. , a velocity gradient along the minor axis centered on source b ) .",
    "however , this does not indicate that there is no infall toward source b , because infalling gas motions perpendicular to the observational line of sight can not be measured .",
    "previous studies of infall in protostellar envelopes assume axisymmetric gas motions to estimate the entire mass infalling rate from the observed velocity gradient along the minor axis @xcite . on the other hand , in the vicinity of protostellar binaries",
    "axisymmetric gas motions can not be assumed because the gravitational field is non - axisymmetric .",
    "thus it is much more difficult to observationally estimate the infalling rates , and compare the mass infalling rates onto the primary and secondary .",
    "our numerical simulation of l1551 ne indeed shows highly asymmetric distributions of the radial ( infall and expansion ) motions ( see figure 9c in takakuwa et al .",
    "2014 ) as well as the azimuthal motions ( figure 9b ) .",
    "detailed comparisons of our numerical simulations and the observational image cubes will be the subject to our forthcoming paper .",
    "in addition to mass infall in cbds onto the protostellar binaries , kinematics of surrounding protostellar envelopes which can replenish cbds with fresh materials should also be taken into account .",
    "our previous aste observations of the large - scale ( @xmath520000 au ) protostellar envelope in l1551 ne have unveiled that the protostellar envelope is being dispersed by the redshifted outflow driven from the neighboring protostar , l1551 irs 5 @xcite . while in the inner @xmath421000 au scale there is an infalling component @xcite , the mass of that component ( @xmath50.002 @xmath16 ) is smaller than the cbd mass ( 0.009  0.076 @xmath16 ; table [ disks ] ) .",
    "thus , further mass supply from the protostellar envelope to the cbd in l1551 ne is not expected .",
    "the inferred present masses of sources a and b are @xmath50.68 @xmath16 and @xmath50.13 @xmath16 , respectively , and even if all the amount of the material in the cbd plus the infalling component is accreted onto the binary , the binary mass and the mass ratio do not change much . therefore ,",
    "even though l1551 ne is a class i protostellar binary associated with the cbd and the protostellar envelope , the mass and the mass ratio are already close to the final values .",
    "our high - resolution cycle 2 observations of l1551 ne have resolved the elongation of the dust components around the individual binary protostars , and measured the position and inclination angles of the csds unambiguously .",
    "furthermore , the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted c@xmath0o emission are associated with the csd of source a , and the major axis of the csd matches with the direction of the velocity gradient",
    ". the radii and velocities of the c@xmath0o emission are consistent with the keplerian rotation with the inferred source a mass of 0.675 @xmath16 ( figure [ fig : pva ] ) .",
    "as discussed in sections [ subsec : cont ] and [ subsubsec : csds ] , the position and inclination angles of the csds around sources a and b are different from those of the cbd .",
    "these results indicate that the csds are misaligned from the cbd , and that the csds are not co - planar with the cbd .",
    "such a non - coplanar configuration could cause precessing motions of the csds , which are lighter than the cbd , on the time scale of the binary orbital period .",
    "the precessing amplitude must be on the order of the difference of the position angles between the cbd and the csd ( @xmath520@xmath8 ) .",
    "previous nir observations have found that source a drives collimated jets along the northeast ( red ) to southwest ( blue ) direction @xcite .",
    "the jets consists of a chain of knots of hp2 ( hh 454a ) , hh29 and 28 on the blueshifted side , and hp3 , 4 ( = hh 454b ) , 5 , and 6 on the redshifted side .",
    "all of these knots are within 2@xmath8 of a common jet axis at p.a .",
    "@xmath561@xmath8 ( the p.a .",
    "of the minor axes of the csd of source a and the cbd are 54@xmath8 and 77@xmath8 , respectively . ) .",
    "the proper motions of these hh knots are also measured to be @xmath5150 km s@xmath21 , and the dynamical timescale of the most distant hh knot , hh 28 , is measured to be @xmath52700 yr .",
    "for comparison , the orbital period of the sources a and b binary system is calculated to be @xmath51700 yr , on the assumption of the circular orbit .",
    "thus , for the last @xmath51.6 orbital periods there is no significant ( within the p.a .",
    "difference between the jet and the csd minor axis of 61@xmath8 - 54@xmath8 = 7@xmath8 ) precession in the disk - jet system of source a , and the misaligned configuration appears to be rather static . in the presence of the misalignment between the cbd and csds",
    ", the infalling material and the angular momenta from the cbd do not smoothly connect to the outermost radii of the csds .",
    "the infalling materials should fall onto the disk surface or even onto the protostar directly .",
    "indeed , from the argument in section [ subsec : inf ] direct infall from the cbd onto the protostar is required to account for the protostellar luminosity with the accretion luminosity .",
    "furthermore , if the infalling materials fall onto the disk surface , such direct impacts could affect the physical and chemical conditions of the csd significantly , and the subsequent disk evolution into the planet formation stage .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : lines ] , the so ( 7@xmath26@xmath3 ) emission is concentrated around source a , and the peak brightness temperature of the so emission is @xmath1946 k to the southeast of source a. in l1489 irs @xcite and l1527 irs @xcite , so lines have been observed in the transitional regions from the infalling envelopes to the inner keplerian disks .",
    "such so emission distributions can be interpreted as the presence of the accretion shocks , although in the other protostars the interpretation of the so emission distributions is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible that the observed intense so emission in the close vicinity of source a may also trace shocks associated with the impacts of the infalling materials from the cbd onto the csd surface .",
    "such so emission distribution associated with the accretion onto csds from the cbd has indeed been found in another binary system of uy aurigae @xcite .",
    "we have performed the alma cycle 2 observations of the protostellar binary system l1551 ne in the 0.9-mm dust - continuum , c@xmath0o ( @xmath17=3 - 2 ) , @xmath1co ( @xmath17=3 - 2 ) , so ( @xmath18=7@xmath2 - 6@xmath3 ) , and the cs ( @xmath17=7 - 6 ) emission at an angular resolution of @xmath50@xmath418 , four times higher than that of our previous cycle 0 observations .",
    "the present cycle 2 observations have unveiled the detailed structures and kinematics of the cbd in l1551 ne , and resolved the csds around the individual binary protostars .",
    "we have also performed numerical simulations and constructed the theoretically - predicted 0.9-mm and c@xmath0o images of l1551 ne , in order to interpret the observed structures and gas motions in the cbd .",
    "the main results are summarized below .    *",
    "the 0.9-mm dust - continuum emission traces two csds around the individual binary protostars , and the cbd in l1551 ne .",
    "the csds are spatially resolved and the deconvolved sizes , position and inclination angles of the csd around source a are measured to be 40 @xmath7 26 au , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , and those around source b are 36 @xmath7 27 au , @xmath40 = 147@xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the position and inclination angles of the csd around source a are different from those of the cbd ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) , and the inclination angle of the csd around source b are also different from that of the cbd .",
    "the cbd exhibits two arm - like features ( arm a to the north and arm b to the south ) , and arm b connects to the csd of source b. furthermore , the brightness distribution of the continuum emission is skewed to the western part of the cbd , suggesting the presence of the @xmath6 mode of the material distribution in the cbd .",
    "the masses of the csds around sources a and b , and the cbd are estimated to be 0.005 - 0.043 @xmath16 , 0.002 - 0.016 @xmath16 , and 0.0090.076 @xmath16 for @xmath67 = 1042 k , respectively . *",
    "the high - velocity blueshifted ( 3.0 - 3.6 km s@xmath21 ) c@xmath0o emission is associated with the northwestern halves of the csds as seen in the 0.9-mm dust - continuum emission .",
    "the redshifted ( 9.6 - 10.7 km s@xmath21 ) counterpart of the c@xmath0o emission is also seen in the southeastern half of the csd of source a , whereas such a redshifted counterpart is not found toward source b. in source a , the direction of the velocity gradient of the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted c@xmath0o emission matches well with the major axis of the csd . in the intermediate velocity",
    "ranges the blueshifted c@xmath0o emission ( 3.9 - 4.5 km s@xmath21 ) connects between the midpoint between sources a and b and the eastern part of arm a , and the redshifted c@xmath0o emission ( 9.0 - 9.4 km s@xmath21 ) between the southeast of source a and the western part of arm b. there is also a east ( red)-west ( blue ) velocity gradient centered on source a. in the lower velocity range the blueshifted emission extends to the western part of arm a and the redshifted emission to the east of arm b. this suggests the presence of east ( blue)-west ( red ) velocity gradients across the arms , and the sense of those velocity gradients is opposite to that around source a. * the east ( red)-west ( blue ) velocity gradient around source a in the cbd represents infalling motion toward source a , whereas the opposite velocity gradients seen across arms a and b represent expanding motion in the arms .",
    "the two arm structures and the expanding motions , and the infall in the inter - arm regions , can all be reproduced with our numerical simulation .",
    "our numerical simulation predicts that the non - axisymmetric gravitational torques of the binary , impart angular momenta to the spiral arms in the cbd and drive faster rotation than the keplerian rotation and expansion , while the gravitational torques extract angular momenta from the inter - arm regions and thus drive infall .",
    "furthermore , our numerical simulation also predicts the @xmath6 mode of the material distribution in the cbd .",
    "* the spatial - velocity distributions of the high - velocity c@xmath0o emission associated with the csd around source a are consistent with the keplerian rotations with the inferred central stellar masses ( = 0.68 @xmath16 ) .",
    "furthermore , the measured differences of the position and inclination angles of the csds around sources a and b from those of the cbd imply that the csds are misaligned with respect to the plane of the cbd .",
    "as the axis of the nir jet knots driven from source a is close to orthogonal to the major axis of the csd and appears unchanged over the past @xmath51.6 orbital period of the binary system ( 1 orbital period @xmath51700 yr ) , the misalignment of the csd is rather static .",
    "since the csds are likely misaligned from the cbd , the infalling materials and the angular momenta from the cbd do not smoothly connect to the outermost radii of the csds , but directly falls onto the surfaces of the csds .",
    "such impacts of the infalling material could significantly change the physical and chemical condition of the csds .",
    "the concentrated so emission in the vicinity of source a may reflect shocks associated with the impact of the infalling material .    we would like to thank n. ohashi , m. hayashi , and m. momose for their fruitful discussions , and all the alma staff supporting this work .",
