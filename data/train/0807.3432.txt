    ", in the presence of an optical lattice ( ol ) , which induces a periodic potential acting on atoms .",
    "the existence of gap solitons in bec was predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite , see also review @xcite .",
    "gap solitons are represented by stationary solutions to the respective gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , with the eigenvalue ( chemical potential ) located in a finite bandgap of the ol - induced spectrum .",
    "note that a periodic potential emulating the ol can also be induced by the spatially - periodic modulation of the transverse trap which confines the condensate in the transverse directions @xcite .",
    "in the limit of a very deep ol , the underlying gpe can be reduced to an effective 1d discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation with the repulsive on - site nonlinearity , assuming that the condensate s wave function is a superposition of functions localized at particular lattice sites , with a nearly vanishing overlap between them @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "gap solitons go over into _ staggered _ discrete solitons , which feature the alternation of the sign of the wave field between adjacent sites of the lattice @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the corresponding ol is weak , the general wave function may be split into a superposition of right- and left - traveling modes , giving rise to a system of coupled - mode equations for the respective slowly varying amplitudes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is tantamount to the well - known coupled - mode equations for optical waves propagating through the bragg grating @xcite .",
    "actually , gap solitons were first predicted @xcite and experimentally created eggleton as optical pulses in fiber bragg gratings .",
    "while the gap solitons are typically studied as standing localized states , a detailed numerical analysis has demonstrated that an initial kick ( represented by a linear phase profile imprinted into the soliton ) may set that them in persistent motion , if the norm of the soliton ( the number of atoms bound in it ) is below a certain threshold value .",
    "the existence of moving gap solitons was predicted in both one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) settings @xcite .    in the bec with attractive interactions ( @xmath1 ) , solitons realize the ground state of the condensate . such solitons were created in condensates of @xmath2li @xcite and @xmath3rb @xcite atoms , with the sign of the atomic interactions switched to attraction by means of the feshbach - resonance technique ( in the latter case , the solitons were observed in a post - collapse state of the condensate ) . in the presence of a periodic potential , such solitons should exist too , with the chemical potential falling in the semi - infinite gap of the spectrum , as first shown in the context of the optical setting @xcite , and later demonstrated in detail in the framework of gpes @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is to predict possible regimes of motion of the 1d matter - wave solitons in the _ self - attractive _ condensate , in the presence of the ol potential .",
    "this will be done in the framework of the nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) , which is known to provide for high accuracy in the description of dynamical properties of solitons supported by the self - attraction .",
    "this model is described in section ii , while section iii summarizes the findings .",
    "the solitons will be first found as stationary solutions to the npse , and then set in motion by suddenly kicking them .",
    "three dynamical regimes will be identified by systematic simulations : steady motion , gradual decay of the moving solitons , and firm pinning , when the kick can not essentially disturb the initial soliton .",
    "in particular , regions where these regimes occur will be charted in a parameter plane of the model .",
    "the paper is concluded by a brief summary in section iv .",
    "dynamics of atomic matter waves in rarefied bec is very accurately described by the time - dependent three - dimensional gpe , @xmath4 \\psi \\ ; ,   \\label{gpe}\\]]where @xmath5 is the macroscopic wave function of the condensate ( normalized to the total number of atoms , @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 the atomic mass , and @xmath8 the @xmath9-wave scattering length of the inter - atomic potential . as the trapping potential , we adopt the usual combination of the tight confinement in the radial direction and longitudinal ol , @xmath10@xmath11with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wavelength of counterpropagating laser beams whose interference creates the ol , and @xmath14 is its effective depth . in the subsequent analysis",
    ", we use the effective one - dimensional npse , which can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) by averaging in the transverse plane @xcite .",
    "the npse has been demonstrated to be very accurate in reproducing results that can be obtained from the full 3d gpe ; in particular , this approach has been tested for bright sala - npse - bright and dark solitons @xcite , two - component condensates @xcite , and for the condensate in a toroidal trap @xcite , as well as for states with axial vorticity @xcite .",
    "a similar approach , which generalizes the thomas - fermi approximation and may give still more accurate results , but does not apply to solitons , was later developed for tightly confined self - repulsive condensates @xcite .",
    "the npse including axial ol potential ( [ potential - z ] ) was derived too @xcite , assuming the following factorization of the 3d wave function in eq .",

    "( [ f ] ) predicts that there exists a critical value , @xmath23 , above which the axially uniform state in the torus becomes modulationally unstable , and is replaced , as the ground state , by a soliton - like configuration .",
    "moreover , there is another critical value of the interaction strength , @xmath24 , above which the localized solution ceases to exist due to the collapse , hence the soliton persists in interval @xmath25 .",
    "similar effects in the toroidal setting were earlier studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "both the full three - dimensional gpe and its npse reduction are mean - field equations .",
    "contrary to the repulsive case , in the attractive case that we are dealing with , there is no superfluid - mott insulator transition . beyond - mean - field effects",
    "are irrelevant in our case too , since , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , they appear at lattice sites populated with a small number of particles ( @xmath26 ) . in our case ,",
    "due to the attractive interaction , most of the atoms reside in few highly populated sites .    as concerns quantum effects",
    ", it may be relevant to mention that , unlike regular solitons in attractive condensates , gap solitons in the bec with repulsion can not represent the ground state .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the full quantum description , the stability of such states needs further analysis .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that dark solitons in bec with repulsive interactions between atoms are subject to quantum depletion , with incoherent atoms gradually filling the dark - soliton s notch under the action of anomalous fluctuations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , dark solitons , which accurately obey the mean - field description provided by the gpe , were successfully observed in the experiment @xcite . because loosely bound gap solitons may feature a set of notches in their tails \"",
    ", they may also be subject to the quantum depletion , in that sense . in terms of the quantum theory , this remains an open question , but the experimental results @xcite clearly demonstrate that gap solitons can be created , following the predictions of the mean - field theory . on the other hand , for tightly bound soliton in the attractive bec ( as well as for tightly gap solitons in the repulsive condensate , if they are created not too close to edges of the respective bandgap @xcite ) , the quantum depletion should not be an issue , as their existence is not predicated on the presence of notches .",
    "as said above , the objective of this work is to analyze the dynamics of moving bright solitons in the model introduced above , which includes the periodic ol potential .",

    "at @xmath61 , the initial width of the soliton , @xmath62 , is , as said above , comparable to the size of the lattice cell . in this case",

    "instead , it is concluded that the soliton interacts with the ol in a complex way , emitting small - amplitude waves , which affect the time evolution of the average width .",
    "figure [ solirun - f3 ] shows the soliton s profile at @xmath65 in the case corresponding to the central panel of fig .",
    "[ solirun - f1 ] , which features the maximum value of @xmath58 .",
    "the figure demonstrates the presence of splinters \" , to the left of the soliton , which actually break off from the soliton shortly after the application of the initial kick .",
    "they travel backwards with respect to the soliton , reaching the largest distance from it at @xmath65 , due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in this situation , expression ( [ mean ] ) does not provide an adequate measure to estimate the spreading of the soliton . in principle , after performing a round trip in the toroidal trap , the splinters may hit the soliton , but the study of this issue require extremely long simulations , which we did not perform in the framework of the present work .     at @xmath65 for the soliton in the central panel of fig .",

    "definition ( entropy ) yields the maximum of the entropy , @xmath75 , if the matter is distributed uniformly , @xmath76 , and the entropy attains its minimum , @xmath77 , if the entire norm is concentrated in a single cell .",
    "we have found that the unnormalized effective entropy , i.e. @xmath78 , turns out to be practically independent of the total length of the system in the axial direction . in particular , while the mean - square width is affected by the backscattered radiation emitted after the kick , the entropy is not .",
    "more precisely , we have checked that the result of the computation of the unnormalized entropy does not change with the variation of the total lengths .    in fig .",
    "[ solirun - f4 ] we plot @xmath79 as a function of time for the same runs which were included in fig .",
    "[ solirun - f2 ] .",
    "it is seen that , for @xmath49 , initial entropy @xmath80 is large , because the soliton covers many cells , and , in the course of the evolution , @xmath79 exhibits periodic small - amplitude oscillations around @xmath80 . on the contrary",
    ", for @xmath46 the stationary soliton covers few cells , hence initial entropy @xmath80 is quite small , but the entropy increases as a consequence of the soliton s spreading out . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the initial entropy is similar to that in the case of @xmath59 , but its evolution is completely different , featuring very small aperiodic oscillations around @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath79 remains nearly constant , as the narrow strongly pinned soliton does not start conspicuous motion or spreading out after being kicked .     are shown here in terms of the evolution of entropy ( [ entropy]).,height=120 ]    thus , our systematic simulations reveal the existence of three different dynamical regimes : ( i ) stable breathers , i.e. , solitons steadily moving across the lattice potential at an almost constant velocity , with small - amplitude shape oscillations ; ( ii ) dispersive dynamics , in which case the soliton strongly spreads out in the course of the evolution ; ( iii ) localization , in which a narrow soliton remains trapped in one lattice cell . in fig .",

    "\\(iii ) the white region : localized solitons , with the center of mass firmly pinned to the initial position . in the latter case , the solitons may be slightly dispersive at the initial stage of the evolution , but their effective entropy is always much smaller than in the other two cases .",
    "figure [ solirun - f5 ] summarizes results of @xmath84 numerical runs , with @xmath85 values of @xmath27 and @xmath86 values of @xmath37 .",
    "the momentum resolution is imposed by the periodic boundary conditions : @xmath87 , where @xmath53 is the total axial length , as defined above . by choosing larger @xmath88",
    ", one can reduce @xmath89 .",
    "the step in the variation of strength @xmath37 in fig .",
    "solirun - f5 is @xmath90 .    , where @xmath27 is the momentum imparted to the soliton by the initial kick , and @xmath91 the strength of the self - attractive nonlinearity .",

    "figure [ solirun - f5 ] shows that the regime of the stable motion is confined to the region of small values of interaction strength @xmath37 . for fixed @xmath37 , a transition from the steady motion to the dispersive regime",
    "is observed with the increase of kick @xmath27 , and the numerical results suggest that the steady - motion region disappears as @xmath27 attains large values .",
    "as expected , the increase of @xmath37 drives the system into the regime of pinning , but one can leave it by increasing the kick .    it should be stressed that , while the border between the localization and other two regimes is well defined , the exact location of the boundary between the steady - motion and dispersive regimes depends on our choice of the @xmath83 maximum for the allowed change of the entropy in the course of the evolution . admitting a @xmath94 change does not conspicuously affects the location of the border , but defining the threshold of @xmath95 makes the region of the stable motion slightly larger ( not shown here in detail ) .    at the boundary between motion and dispersion regimes ,",
    "we observe a density profile that becomes more and more noisy , while the velocity of the traveling soliton decreases in an irregular way , similar to some regimes of the motion of gap solitons in the 1d model with the repulsive cubic nonlinearity , which were reported in ref .",
    "this drop in the velocity is also relevant to the identification of the boundary of the pinning regime , where , typically , the kicked soliton visits a few lattice sites and then stops .",
    "for instance , at @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the soliton passes a few sites , then bounces back to the original position , and stays pinned there .",
    "the diagram of the dynamical regimes depends on parameters of the optical lattice , @xmath14 and @xmath98 , see eq .",
    "( [ potential - z ] ) .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ solirun - f6 ] , obtained by collecting results of other @xmath99 numerical runs , displays this diagram for a stronger lattice , with @xmath100 , while the ol period remains equal to @xmath101 ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the picture is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ solirun - f5 ] , but there are apparent quantitative differences . in particular , the regions of the stable motion and dispersive behavior are strongly reduced , which is not surprising , as the deeper ol can pin the solitons stronger .",
    "in addition , the figure shows that there exists a critical momentum , @xmath102 , above which the region of steady motion does not exist anymore .",
    "this critical value @xmath102 decreases with the increase of ol depth @xmath14 .    , but for @xmath103 . ]",
    "as mentioned above , the upper bound for the considered values of the interaction strength , @xmath37 , is imposed by the onset of the collapse , @xmath104 . in particular , in ref . @xcite it was found that @xmath105 for @xmath36 , and @xmath106 for @xmath103 ( if @xmath50 is fixed ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimum strength above which soliton states exist is @xmath107 @xcite ; in this work , this border does not manifest itself , as we considered values of @xmath37 at which the soliton is well localized within the lattice ; in fact , we always took @xmath108 .    in an attempt to understand the behavior of the kicked soliton in analytical terms",
    ", we tried a variational approach . using a gaussian _ ansatz _ , we derived the respective variational equations of motion .",
    "we have thus obtained a set of equations equivalent to that recently reported in ref .",
    "however , a careful analysis demonstrates that this approach fails to describe the soliton s dynamics correctly in the present model : although it does predict regions of pinning , moving breathers , and solutions whose width expands indefinitely , the resulting diagram is quite different from those in figs .",
    "[ solirun - f5 ] and [ solirun - f6 ] .",
    "this problem might be expected , since , even in the static case , the gaussian ansatz does not reproduce the behavior revealed by numerical solutions sala - periodic .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of moving matter - wave solitons in the self - attractive bec trapped in the axial optical - lattice potential .",
    "the dynamics was induced by kicking a stationary soliton via the phase imprinting . we have performed systematic simulations of the time - dependent nonpolynomial schrdinger equation , which accurately describes bose - einstein condensates under the tight transverse confinement .",
    "three dynamical regimes have been identified .",
    "the first of them is the steady motion of stable solitons with small - amplitude intrinsic oscillations , which is observed at relatively small values of the strength of the inter - atomic attraction @xmath37 , and relatively small size of the kick @xmath27 , and the second is the dispersive regime , in which the soliton s velocity decreases irregularly , while the soliton suffers systematic spreading . the latter outcome of the application of the kick to the soliton also occurs for relatively small @xmath37 , but at larger @xmath27 .",
    "the third regime naturally features firm pinning , at large values of @xmath37 and small @xmath27 .",
    "a somewhat similar description for dynamical regimes was elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the position of the different regions in the respective parameter plane is totally different , due to the fact that the quasi - discrete limit considered in that work is not adequate for comparison with the present model .",
    "available experimental techniques @xcite make the experimental realization of the predicted dynamical regimes quite feasible .",
    "it may also be relevant , for the purposes of the theory and plausible experiment alike , to study in details collisions between steadily moving solitons .",
    "the latter problem will be considered elsewhere .",
