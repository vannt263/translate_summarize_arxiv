    "understanding the properties and behaviour of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies in the early universe is a cornerstone of modern galaxy evolution studies .",
    "galaxies at early epochs show significantly elevated gas fractions relative to their local analogues @xcite , and it is these massive gas reservoirs that drive the enhanced star formation rates characteristic of the high-@xmath11 universe ( i.e. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .    a variety of techniques have been used to observe the gas reservoirs in distant galaxies .",
    "traditionally , the detection of intergalactic molecular gas ( particularly at high-@xmath11 ) has relied on observations of various molecular emission lines of carbon monoxide ( @xmath6co ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "co exists in the centres of molecular clouds , and  with the aid of a co - to - h@xmath7 conversion factor  observations of the co line luminosity can be converted into a mass of molecular gas .",
    "this conversion is non - trivial however , with the abundance of co relative to h@xmath7 varying as a function of ism metallicity ( increased metal abundance results in larger quantities of dust to protect co from photodissociation ) and even galactic behaviour ( in merging systems the star - forming ism no longer consists of discrete molecular clouds , making co a more efficient tracer of molecular gas ) .",
    "moreover , recent results have suggested that co may also be destroyed by cosmic rays ( produced indirectly by star formation , via supernovae , as well as agn activity ) .",
    "the ism of intensely star - forming galaxies , which produce a large cosmic ray flux , may be a hostile environment for co molecules making it a less effective tracer of molecular gas than previously thought ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another method for tracing molecular gas is via the long - wavelength dust emission .",
    "observations of the dust continuum can be converted into a total dust mass , which , with the aid of an assumed gas - to - dust ratio , can be used to calculate a gas mass ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this technique has some advantages over the use of co lines : dust continuum observations are generally less time intensive , allowing for larger samples to be assembled .",
    "the dust mass method is not without its disadvantages , however .",
    "the dust temperature must be constrained ( or assumed ) in order for a dust mass to be measured .",
    "in addition , the gas - to - dust ratio remains a relatively poorly studied quantity , which may vary by up to a factor of @xmath12 in bright star - forming galaxies @xcite , as well as potentially varying at high redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , observations of the dust continuum provide no kinematic information , which is available when observing co emission lines .    in recent years , the emission line of atomic carbon ( ( @xmath13 ) ; ( @xmath0 ) hereafter ) has been found to be an excellent alternate tracer of the cold molecular ism , being closely associated with low-@xmath5 co emission across a wide range of environments and redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by both detailed studies of nearby galactic molecular clouds ( in which co and  are found to co - exist throughout the bulk of the cold molecular component ; @xcite ) , as well as hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .    using  as a molecular gas tracer offers a number of advantages , compared to observations of both co and the dust continuum . due to the simplicity of the quantum fine structure level of , many physical parameters ( including excitation temperature and total carbon mass )",
    "can be calculated with minimal uncertainty . and while co becomes an increasingly poor tracer of molecular gas as metallicity decreases ( due to a lack of dust grains being available to shield co molecules from photodissociation )",
    ",  is affected far less severely  significantly reducing the uncertainty on the molecular gas mass introduced by unknown metal abundances .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that a high cosmic - ray ionisation rate will destroy co molecules , dissociating them into , while leaving the underlying h@xmath7 unaffected .",
    "additionally , observations of the  line provide the same valuable kinematic information as co , offering a distinct advantage over dust - based methods . as a result",
    "can be a powerful and effective tracer of the molecular ism in distant galaxies .    in this work ,",
    "we present observations of the ( @xmath0 ) emission line in a sample of strongly lensed dusty star forming galaxies ( dsfgs ) which were identified via the south pole telescope ( spt ; @xcite ) wide - field survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "dsfgs are extremely luminous star - forming galaxies ( typical sfrs @xmath14 m@xmath4/yr ) , which are thought to be the high-@xmath11 progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the @xmath15 universe .",
    "the spt has proven to be an efficient machine for finding the brightest ( strongly - lensed ) dsfgs in the universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dsfgs in this work were all taken from the 26-galaxy sample targeted for spectroscopic redshift identification by the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) in cycle 0 @xcite , which confirmed redshifts via the identification of a number of atomic and molecular emission lines .",
    "thirteen dsfgs were found to lie at redshifts @xmath16 , shifting the ( @xmath0 ) into alma band 3 . in this work we present an analysis of the  properties of these 13 sources .",
    "this paper falls broadly into two halves . in the first half , we present an analysis of the  properties of our sample . we describe the sample and the various ancillary data in  2 , and in  3 we present our analysis of the ( @xmath0 ) data ( including calculations of the mass and cooling contribution of atomic carbon , analysis of the kinematic properties of the sample , and discussions of the use of ( @xmath0 ) as a tracer of molecular gas and star formation mode ) . moving to the second half of the paper , in",
    " 4 we combine the ( @xmath0 ) line with a variety of atomic and molecular emission lines in order to constrain the physical conditions in the ism of our galaxies using a modern photodissociation region ( pdr ) modelling code , 3d - pdr .",
    "we present a discussion of our results in  5 , and we present our conclusions in  6 . throughout this work",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath17-cdm cosmology with parameters taken from @xcite ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the 13 sources presented in this work were originally targeted as part of our alma blind redshift search programme @xcite , in which 26 spt dsfgs were observed across the entirety of alma band 3 ( @xmath21 ghz ) as part of the cycle 0 ` early compact array ' setup .",
    "each observation consisted of 5 distinct 7.5 ghz tunings , spaced to cover the band .",
    "each source was observed for 120s in each tuning configuration .",
    "further details of the observing programme and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "13 of the 26 dsfgs lie in the redshift range @xmath16 , causing the ( @xmath0 ) emission line ( @xmath22 492.161 ghz ) to be redshifted into band 3 . of these 13 sources , just one (",
    "spt0345 - 47 ) was not detected in ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "a further two sources ( spt0300 - 46 and spt2103 - 60 ) are tentatively detected at the @xmath23 level ( i.e. , 3 times the rms channel noise , which we measure to be 2.1 mjy and 2.6 mjy per 50 km / s channel respectively ) .",
    "the remaining 10 sources all show clearly detected ( @xmath0 ) emission at @xmath24 significance .    for spt0345 - 47",
    ", we calculate a @xmath25 upper limit on the intensity of the ( @xmath0 ) emission line :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the rms channel noise in the spectrum of spt0345 - 47 ( which we measure to be 2.4 mjy per 50 km / s channel ) , @xmath28 is the mean linewidth of the detected sample ( = 410 km / s ) , and @xmath29 is the bin size in kms@xmath30 ( = 50 km / s ) .",
    "we calculate an upper limit on the  line intensity for spt0345 - 47 of @xmath31(1 - 0 ) } < 1.03 $ ] jy km / s .",
    "figure [ fig : prop1 ] shows spectral cutouts at the position of the ( @xmath0 ) line for the 13 spt dsfgs analysed in this work . for reference , we have overlaid ( where available ) the co(@xmath32 ) emission line ( scaled arbitrarily in flux for ease of comparison ) .    due to a lack of x - ray data for our sample we can not rule out a possible agn component in any of our 13 dsfgs .",
    "however it is unlikely that any of our sources contains a significant agn .",
    "dsfgs as a class are star - formation dominated ( i.e. , the bolometric output of the galaxy originates predominantly from young massive stars , rather than accretion onto a central compact object ) ; even dsfgs with some measurable agn activity tend to be primarily star - formation - driven objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , chandra x - ray observations of the most compact and ir - luminous spt - dsfg , spt0346 - 52 , found no sign of agn activity ( ma et al . , 2016 ) .",
    "we proceed with the assumption that our the dsfgs in our sample are star - formation dominated objects .",
    "all 13 galaxies presented in this work are strongly gravitationally lensed , and have detailed lens models based on alma @xmath33 m observations , which allow their lensing magnifications to be calculated @xcite .",
    "we discuss the use of these lens models to remove the effects of gravitational lensing in  3.1 below .",
    "the spt - dsfg sample has been the target of several followup programmes designed to survey a number of ism diagnostics . in particular , in addition to the ( @xmath0 ) emission lines presented in this work , 9/13 sources have observations covering the co(@xmath32 ) emission line , 10/13 have observations covering the co(@xmath34 ) emission line ( the remaining 3 have observed co(@xmath35 ) emission , which can be converted to ( @xmath34 ) with the aid of an assumed co spectral line energy distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ) .",
    "in addition , 10/13 have the  emission line observed .",
    "the mid-@xmath5 lines of co come from the alma spectra used in this work .",
    "the  observations were obtained from the apex first light apex submillimetre heterodyne receiver ( flash ) , and the herschel ` spire ' fts spectrometer .",
    "observations were made at 345 ghz ( for sources with redshifts @xmath36 ) and 460ghz ( @xmath37 ) , with system temperatures of 230 k and 170 k respectively .",
    "further details of the observations and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the low-@xmath5 co observations were taken by the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , as part of a targeted program aimed at obtaining co(@xmath0 ) or co(@xmath32 ) for spt dsfgs with secure redshifts .",
    "atca was used in its h214 hybrid array configuration , with the compact array broadband backend in wide bandwidth mode .",
    "the mean rms noise for the co(@xmath32 ) observations used in this work was 0.5 mjy per 50 km / s channel .",
    "further details of the observations and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "this suite of molecular emission lines enables a more detailed treatment of the conditions of the ism , as multiple line ratios can be used to independently constrain various parameters of interest .",
    "throughout this work , we calculate emission line luminosities using the formulae below",
    ". luminosities in solar units ( l@xmath4 ) , which represent the true energy output carried by the emission line ( used , for example , for calculating cooling contributions ) are calculated following @xcite :      where @xmath39 is the velocity - integrated line flux in jy km s@xmath30 , @xmath40 is the rest frequency in ghz , and @xmath41 is the luminosity distance in mpc . alternatively , line luminosities in units of k km s@xmath30 pc@xmath42 are calculated using        table [ tab : lum ] lists line luminosities ( in solar units ) for the dsfgs used in this work .",
    "in addition , we also list in table [ tab : lum ] the bolometric far - ir luminosity , calculated using greybody sed fits to far - ir / millimetre photometry ( greve et al . 2012 ) .",
    "note that all values in table [ tab : lum ] are observed quantities , which have not been corrected for the effects of gravitational lensing .",

    "all luminosities are given in solar units , and have not been corrected for gravitational lensing .",
    "where @xmath6co(@xmath34 ) transition line luminosities are not directly measured , they are inferred from the @xmath6co(@xmath35 ) line luminosity using the conversions derived by @xcite , and are shown in parentheses .",
    "the far - infrared luminosities are derived by integrating under a modified blackbody curve from 8 - 1000@xmath44 m . lensing magnifications are derived from visibility - based lens models fit to alma 870@xmath44 m observations ( spilker et al .",
