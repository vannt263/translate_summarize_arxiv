    "the electron , as an elementary particle , has spin and charge , and further acquires an angular momentum quantum number corresponding to a quantized atomic orbital when binded to the atomic nucleus .",
    "the importance of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect in semiconductors and other materials have been extensively explored in quantum physics and quantum chemistry .",
    "for example , soc causes shifts in the atomic energy level of an electron  @xcite , and leads to protected metallic surface or edge states as a consequence of the topology of the bulk electronic wave functions  @xcite . as a typical relativistic effect",
    ", soc has magnitude of the order @xmath2 for a hydrogen like atom  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the nuclear charge , @xmath4 in the atomic unit is the fine structure constant and @xmath5 is the speed of light . for systems containing heavy elements with large @xmath3 , the nonrelativistic schrdinger type equations such as the kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory  @xcite leads to large error @xcite .",
    "the extension of the density functional theory is not straightforward as quantum electrodynamics has to been used for charged particles in which complicated renormalization is necessary to get finite expressions for charge , energy , _ etc _  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic density functional theory , first laid out by rajagopal and callaway  @xcite , can be rigorously derived from quantum electrodynamics .",
    "however , the resulting equations are too complicated to solve in practice and proper renormalization has to be performed to eliminate the divergent terms .",
    "the frequently - used working equations are the four - component dirac - kohn - sham ( dks ) equations derived by rajagopal  @xcite and independently by macdonald and vosko  @xcite after making several physically reasonable approximations .",
    "the extension to the time - dependent scenario can be found in _ _",
    "e.g. _ _  @xcite .        mathematically , the dks operator is fundamentally different from the ks operator .",
    "the spectrum of the dks operator , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemelobpcg ] , consists of the point spectrum ( blue dots ) , the positive energy continuum ( thick blue line from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) and the negative energy continuum ( thin red line from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) , and is therefore unbounded from blow  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the spectrum of the ks operator does not contain any negative energy and is bounded from below .",
    "here @xmath10 is the electron mass and we have @xmath11 and @xmath12 in atomic unit .",
    "when solving the dks equations numerically , the dks operator will be discretized by a basis set of finite size , and both the positive energy continuum and the negative energy continuum will be truncated before infinity is reached .",
    "hereafter we refer to the set of eigenvalues of the discretized dks operator in the point spectrum and the positive energy continuum as the _ positive energy band _ , and the set of eigenvalues of the discretized dks operator in the negative energy continuum as the _ negative energy band_. there are approximately equal number of eigenvalues in the positive and the negative energy bands separated by a large gap , which is also called the forbidden region with its width denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we denote by @xmath14 the maximum of the widths of the positive and the negative energy band .",
    "the desired eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the positive energy band are usually contained in the point spectrum or in very rare cases cover the entire point spectrum and a very few low lying states in the positive energy continuum .",
    "attempts to solve the dks equations are plagued by the so - called `` variational collapse ''  @xcite , which specifically means two difficulties .",
    "the first difficulty is the so - called spectral pollution ",
    "the appearance of spurious eigenvalues which are the limiting points of the eigenvalues of the discretized dks operator as the basis set becomes complete , but are not the eigenvalues of the true dks operator .",
    "they often lie deeper than the desired solutions or may even be degenerate with them .",
    "the second difficulty is the occurrence of the spurious eigenvalues in the forbidden region when solving the discretized dks operator using inappropriate numerical schemes .",
    "the reason for such collapse is that the spectrum of the dks operator can not be defined variationally  @xcite .",
    "several prescriptions to avoid variational collapse were summarized and analyzed by kutzelnigg  @xcite as well as lewin and sr  @xcite . among all the prescriptions , the kinetic balance prescription  @xcite addresses the first difficulty most successfully from practical point of view , and serves as the foundation for most successful attempts to solve the dks equations via finite dimensional matrix eigenvalue problems .",
    "many effective numerical implementations for performing four - component dks calculations with the localized basis sets ( _ _ e.g. _ _  gaussian type orbitals and atomic orbitals ) have been presented by quantum chemists in the last four decades , including the dvm scheme  @xcite , the bdf package  @xcite , the program of fricke and coworkers  @xcite , the rel4d module in utchem  @xcite , the dks module in dirac  @xcite and the bertha code  @xcite . in all these methods",
    ", the finite dimensional dks matrix is diagonalized directly as a dense matrix , which computes all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in both positive and the negative energy bands .",
    "the direct diagonalization methods avoid the second difficulty in the variational collapse originating from inappropriate numerical schemes . however , these methods are prohibitively expensive when the dimension of the discretized dks operator becomes large .    while the localized basis sets are widely used in the community of quantum chemistry ,",
    "the planewave basis set is more popular in the community of condensed matter physics for the reason that systematic convergence can be achieved by only increasing the kinetic energy cutoff .",
    "the planewave basis set can be used as the only basis set in the pseudopotential framework  @xcite , and as an augmented basis set such as in the linearized augmented planewave method ( lapw )  @xcite . in terms of the dks",
    "density functional theory , the planewave basis set automatically satisfies the kinetic balance prescription and is free from the spectral pollution @xcite .",
    "however , compared to the localized basis set , the planewave basis set leads to matrix eigenvalue problems of much larger size which is impractical to be diagonalized directly as dense matrices .",
    "iterative methods have to be designed to solve the matrix eigenvalue problems for the desired eigenvalues and eigenvectors contained in the positive energy band .",
    "there are approximately the same number of eigenvalues in the positive and the negative energy bands , and standard iterative techniques for solving the ks systems can not be efficiently applied without necessary modification .",
    "for example ,",
    "the conjugate gradient method  @xcite , the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient ( lobpcg ) method  @xcite , the rmm - diis method  @xcite and the lanczos method  @xcite need to evaluate all the states in the negative energy band and therefore is prohibitively expensive ; it is difficult to design a set of efficient filtering polynomials as in the chebyshev filtering method  @xcite , since the separation between the occupied and unoccupied eigenvalues in the positive energy band ( usually in the order of @xmath15 au or smaller ) is much smaller compared to the width of the forbidden region ( @xmath16 au ) .",
    "the spectral radius of the matrix resulting from the spectrum folding technique  @xcite will be in the order of @xmath17 for the dks equations , and the resulting positive definite eigenvalue problem can not be solved efficiently with iterative methods .    in this work ,",
    "an efficient iterative method to directly solve the four - component dks density functional theory will be presented for the first time .",
    "the key component of our method is a filtering step ( f ) which can act as a preconditioner in preconditioned iterative diagonalization methods .",
    "in particular , our method is demonstrated based on the lobpcg method , and is therefore dubbed the lobpcg - f method . compared to other types of preconditioned conjugate gradient methods , the lobpcg method has been shown to be effective for evaluating a relatively large number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors , and its efficiency has been illustrated in large scale electronic structure calculation such as in abinit  @xcite .",
    "however , for the dks systems , the standard lobpcg method amplifies the error of the eigenfunctions projected to the negative energy band in each iteration , and therefore needs to evaluate all the eigenfunctions in the negative energy band together with the desired eigenfunctions in the positive energy band .",
    "we illustrate that such error can be efficiently controlled by the filtering step , and the desired eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the positive energy band can be evaluated without computing any negative energy state .",
    "the filtering step only introduces @xmath18 extra matrix - vector multiplication per iteration , and can be implemented simply as a preconditioner with little coding effort .",
    "we implement the lobpcg - f method to solve the dks equations in the pseudopotential framework with a planewave basis set ( module dks ) . to benchmark our numerical results",
    ", we also implement the standard lobpcg method for solving the ks density functional theory ( module ks ) , and for solving the two - component ks density functional theory with soc in the pseudopotential framework ( module ksso ) .",
    "we directly compare the total energies obtained from the modules ks and ksso with those obtained from the corresponding modules in a popular electronic structure software abinit  @xcite .",
    "we apply the modules ks , ksso and dks to solve systems including pt@xmath0 , au@xmath0 , tlf , and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "the differences in the total free energy are less than @xmath19 mev per atom compared to abinit for all systems under study . despite that the relativistic correction is relatively small for valence - valence interaction , our numerical results for solving the dks equations indicate that the lobpcg - f method is robust and efficient in studying the relativistic effect in systems containing heavy elements .",
    "all the discussion in the rest of the manuscript will be presented in the pseudopotential framework in the context of orthogonal basis set ( the planewave basis set is orthogonal ) .",
    "we remark that the lobpcg - f method can be used for all - electron calculation and for non - orthogonal basis functions as well .",
    "this is the case for the lapw method such as implemented in the wien2k software  @xcite , and also for the localized basis set given that the overlap matrix is not very ill - conditioned .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the four - component dks density functional theory in section  [ sec : reldft - dks ] and discuss in detail the variational collapse and the choice of basis set .",
    "we develop the lobpcg - f algorithm in section  [ sec : lobpcgf ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented with discussion in section  [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . throughout the paper , the atomic units ( @xmath20 )",
    "will be used unless otherwise noted .",
    "we will now describe the main working equations ",
    "the dks equations derived by rajagopal @xcite and independently by macdonald and vosko @xcite , and refer to engel  @xcite and van wllen  @xcite for a elaborate and general discussion on relativistic density functional theory which can be rigorously derived from quantum electrodynamics .",
    "several related numerical issues are then discussed , such as the variational collapse and the choice of basis in solving the dks matrix eigenvalue problems .      under the no - pair and electrostatic approximations  @xcite , the total energy of an interacting @xmath21-electron system corresponding to the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian takes the form @xmath22 = t[\\rho,{{\\mathbf{m } } } ] + \\int v_{\\text{ext}}({{\\mathbf{r } } } )",

    "the first term @xmath26 is the kinetic energy of the noninteracting reference system suggested by kohn and sham @xcite , the third term is the electrostatic energy , and @xmath27 is the exchange - correlation functional containing both the difference between the true many body electron - electron repulsive energy and the electrostatic energy , and the difference between the true many body kinetic energy and the kinetic energy of the noninteracting reference system .",
    "this factious system , which could be represented by a single slater determinant in terms of one - electron spinors @xmath28 corresponding to the energy levels @xmath29 , has the same electron density as the interacting many body system . in consequence , we could use @xmath28 to evaluate the kinetic energy and the densities @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dirac operator corresponding to free particles , @xmath32 is the momentum operator , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath35 unit and null matrices , @xmath36 is the vector of the pauli spin matrices , and the each spinor @xmath37 is a complex vector - valued function : @xmath38 , which are often rewritten as @xmath39 with @xmath40 being functions : @xmath41 .",
    "in what follows we will often refer to the two - spinor @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) as the large ( resp .",
    "small ) component of the four - spinor @xmath37 . here",
    "the summations are only restricted to the occupied states in the positive energy band .",

    "\\chi_i \\end{matrix } \\right ) = \\left ( \\begin{matrix } \\phi_i \\\\ \\chi_i \\end{matrix } \\right ) \\epsilon_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 here for simplicity the exchange - correlation functional under local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite is used .",
    "our discussion below is not restricted to the lda approximation .",
    "ideally all - electron calculations should be performed to obtain accurate results , but with large computational cost in order to resolve the sharp gradient of core orbitals and the oscillation of valance orbitals in the neighborhood of nuclei . a more practical way striking",
    "the balance between accuracy and efficiency is to employ effective core potentials  @xcite , in which the core electrons are frozen and the valance - only problem is solved .",
    "the pseudopotential technique is one branch of effective core potential approaches .",
    "one should be careful in choosing pseudopotential for a relativistic hamiltonian such as dks , since most of the existing pseudopotentials are generated for the nonrelativistic hamiltonian .",
    "the mismatch between the pseudopotential and the relativistic hamiltonian introduce possibly double counting of the relativistic effect @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the widely known hgh pseudopotential  @xcite which includes the scalar relativistic effect and the spin - orbit coupling effect of the core electrons by construction , and can be specified by a very small number of parameters due to its dual - space gaussian form . rigorously speaking",
    ", the hgh pseudopotential may still suffer from double counting of the relativistic effect , since the parameters are optimized using the non - relativisitic equations . on the other hand , the numerical method developed in this paper",
    "does not depend on the specific choice of parameters of the hgh pseudopotential , and the numerical results can be readily improved when the hgh pseudopotential is reparametrized for the dks calculation .",
    "the hgh pseudopotential consists of three parts @xmath47 where the subscript @xmath48 is the angular momentum number , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 represent in the order the local contribution , the nonlocal contribution and the soc effect of the hgh pseudopotential , of which the formulas can be found in @xcite and thus are skipped here to save space . @xmath52",

    ", we finally arrive the dks equation for valence electrons @xmath58\\psi_i({{\\mathbf{r } } } ) + \\int { { \\mathbf{v}}}_{\\text{hgh}}({{\\mathbf{r}}},{{\\mathbf{r } } } ' ) \\psi_i({{\\mathbf{r}}}')\\dif{{\\mathbf{r } } } ' = \\psi_i({{\\mathbf{r } } } ) \\epsilon_i.\\ ] ] the nuclear attraction term @xmath59 in eq .",
    "is replaced here by the @xmath60 term that describes the electrostatic interaction between the effective nuclei and valance electrons . the dks equations   or",
    "are usually solved with the self - consistent field ( scf ) iteration as in the case of the nonrelativistic ks equations  @xcite .      as we have mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the most salient feature of the dks operator is that its spectrum contains the negative energy continuum and is therefore unbounded from below .",
    "the desired eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to the occupied bound states lie in the positive energy band ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schemelobpcg ] ) , _ _",
    "i.e. _ _  we are seeking for highly excited states above all the negative energy states . when solving the resulting matrix eigenvalue problems by expanding @xmath37 in eq .   with a finite basis set",
    ", such feature of the dks operator imposes a large obstacle , _ _",
    "i.e. _ _  the variational collapse called by schwarz and wallmeier  @xcite , in the sense that the eigenvalues of the discretized dks operator may not systematically converge to the eigenvalues of the true dks operator as the basis size increases .",
    "this variational collapse , is imputed by kutzelnigg  @xcite to the wrong nonrelativistic limit of the matrix representation of the dirac operator and several prescriptions have been proposed to avoid it .",
    "the first strategy is to replace minimization procedures by min - max procedures  @xcite .",
    "the min - max methods find the minimum over the large component of the spinors and the maximum over the small component of the spinors for the dks energy functional , and these methods are not used often practically in electronic structure calculation .",
    "the second strategy is the two - component relativistic theory which seeks for operators which are bounded from below and agrees with the dks operator in the nonrelaticistic limit  @xcite .",
    "a very good discussion of approaches made in this direction can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the third strategy is to carefully choose the basis set with which the discretized dks operator is free of the spectral pollution . among all the strategies ,",
    "the kinetic balance method  @xcite , falling into the third category , is widely used by theoretical chemists  @xcite , and serves as the basis of most successful attempts to solve matrix eigenvalue equations based on finite - dimensional representations of the dks operator .",
    "the feature of the kinetic balance is the one - to - one correspondence of the basis sets that are used to expand the large and small components , achieved via a linear operator @xmath61 .",
    "specifically , the basis @xmath62 for expanding the small components are obtained directly from the basis @xmath63 for expanding the large components , according to the so - called kinetic balance prescription @xmath64 the use of the kinetic balance avoids the worst aspects of variational collapse and could generate the desired eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the positive energy band with good accuracy if a sufficiently flexible basis set is employed @xcite .",
    "the localized basis sets satisfying the kinetic balance prescription are often used in quantum chemistry and all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the discretized dks operator are obtained by the direct diagonalization method including the negative energy band that are not used in practice .",
    "compared to the standard localized basis sets used in the relativistic quantum chemistry community , the planewave basis set has the advantage that systematic convergence can be achieved by tuning one parameter  the kinetic energy cutoff  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the planewave basis set automatically satisfies the kinetic balance prescription  , _",
    "_ i.e. _ _  the space spanned by planewaves within a certain cutoff is invariant when applied by the @xmath65 operator , and therefore the planewave basis set is a good basis set for both the large component and the small component .",
    "namely , the planewave basis set can avoid the spectral pollution in practice . however , the planewave basis set usually results in a much larger degrees of freedom per atom ( in the order of @xmath66 or more for standard norm conserving pseudopotential  @xcite with only valence electrons taken into consideration ) , which is much larger than the degrees of freedom per atom used by localized basis set .",
    "we remark that the degrees of freedom used by the finite difference method and the finite element method will also be much larger than the degrees of freedom used by localized basis set , but it is less obvious how the kinetic balance prescription will be enforced in these methods .    due to the large matrix size after the planewave discretization",
    ", the direct diagonalization method will not be applicable .",
    "the discretized hamiltonian operator in generated by the planewave basis set , hereafter also referred to as the hamiltonian matrix , is dense in both the fourier space and the real space , which discourages the usage of the shift - invert lanczos method  @xcite , the contour integral based spectrum slicing methods  @xcite , or the fermi operator expansion based low order scaling algorithms  @xcite .",
    "these methods involve matrix inversion and become less competitive when the matrix is dense .",
    "furthermore , techniques that directly eliminate the negative energy band , such as exact two - component theory  @xcite involves direct manipulation of the hamiltonian matrix , which is again not possible to handle in the case of the planewave basis set as a result of the large matrix size .",
    "iterative methods have to be used to diagonalize the discretized hamiltonian operator , which will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : lobpcgf ] .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , there are approximately the same number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the positive and the negative energy bands , separated by a large spectral gap with width @xmath13 as shown in fig  [ fig : schemelobpcg ] . existing iterative techniques for solving the ks equations can not be efficiently applied to solve the dks equations without necessary modification . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that the negative energy band of the dks operator can be efficiently eliminated using only @xmath18 additional matrix - vector multiplications per iteration , based on the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient ( lobpcg ) method  @xcite .",
    "the key component of the proposed new method is an additional filtering ( f ) step , and we therefore refer to our new method as the lobpcg - f method .",
    "we remark that a similar filtering procedure can also be applied to other preconditioned iterative solvers to eliminate the negative energy band , such as the preconditioned davidson type methods  @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : scfconv ] compares the convergence of the scf iteration for ks , ksso and dks using au@xmath0 as an example .",
    "the convergence of the scf iteration is measured by the quantity @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the local part of the effective potential before each scf iteration , and @xmath69 is the effective potential after each scf iteration . fig .",
    "[ fig : scfconv ] indicates that the usage of the lobpcg - f method does not deteriorate the convergence rate of the scf iteration . combining table  [ tab : efficiency ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : scfconv ] , we conclude that the lobpcg - f is a robust and efficient method for solving the dks system in practice .",
    "in this manuscript we develop for the first time a simple and efficient iterative algorithm , named the lobpcg - f method , for directly solving the dirac - kohn - sham ( dks ) equations in the relativistic density functional theory . by adding an additional filtering step in the preconditioning stage of the lobpcg method ,",
    "the lobpcg - f method is able to compute the desired eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the positive energy band without computing any state in the negative energy band .",
    "the lobpcg - f method requires only @xmath18 extra computational costs and little extra coding effort , and thus remarkably facilitates the transition from nonrelativistic kohn - sham ( ks ) calculations using lobpcg methods to relativistic dks calculations in studying the relativistic effect such as spin - orbit coupling , without the need of approximating the dks equation by two - component relativistic theory .",
    "we also remark that even though the lobpcg - f method is efficient for solving the dks systems , it is still significantly more expensive to solve the more complicated four - component dks systems compared to the ks systems or the ksso systems . in practice",
    "one should decide whether two - component theory or the four - component theory should be pursued by balancing the desired efficiency and accuracy .",
    "the efficiency of the filtering step is determined by the factor @xmath70 , where @xmath13 is the spectral gap between the positive and the negative energy band , and @xmath14 is the maximum of the widths of the positive and the negative energy band ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schemelobpcg ] ) .",
    "the smaller the factor is , the more efficiently the filter performs .",
    "it is worth highlighting that the proposed filtering technique is more general and can be embedded into other preconditioned iterative solvers , while the lobpcg method is employed in this work for its high efficiency in the electronic structure calculation .",
    "we demonstrate the applicability of the lobpcg - f method in the pseudopotential framework in the planewave basis set , in which the condition @xmath71 is satisfied .",
    "the planewave basis set automatically satisfies the kinetic balance prescription and is free from the variational collapse .",
    "our results compared with abinit indicate that our implementation is accurate , and the lobpcg - f method does not lead to deterioration in the convergence rate of the scf iteration .",
    "we directly observe that the difference between the total energies between the two - component ks density functional theory with soc description ( module ksso ) and the dks description ( module dks ) is no more than a few tens of mev per atom for systems under study , and thus it is not cost - effective to solve the four - component dks problem in the pseudopotential framework for most systems in practice .",
    "the lobpcg - f method will be more effective for studying the relativistic effects in solving the all - electron dks system directly when the condition @xmath71 is satisfied , such as using the linearized augmented plane - wave basis set ( lapw ) as in the wien2k software , or the localized basis set given that the basis set remains well conditioned",
