    "one of the most intriguing general relativistic features of the space  time structure generated by mass  energy currents is represented by the gravitomagnetic corrections to the orbital motion of a test particle freely falling in the gravitational field of a central body of mass @xmath0 , radius @xmath7 and angular velocity @xmath8 .",
    "they have been extensively worked out by a number of authors .    in regard to the so called gravitomagnetic clock effect on the coordinate sidereal periods of a couple of counter ",
    "orbiting test particles following identical , circular equatorial orbits we quote the references .",
    "as it is well known , the time @xmath9 required for describing a geodesic circular , equatorial full orbit of radius @xmath10 , as viewed from an asymptotically inertial observer , is given by t^=t^(0)2 , where @xmath11 is the classical keplerian period , @xmath12 is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath13 is the proper angular momentum of the central mass , supposed to be spherically symmetric , @xmath14 is the speed of light in vacuum and the signs + and - refer to the two possible senses of motion of the test particle along its orbit .",
    "the sign + refers to the counterclockwise sense of rotation as viewed from the tip of @xmath15 while the sign - refers to the clockwise sense of rotation .",
    "the interesting observable is the difference @xmath16 in which the classical newtonian terms are canceled out and the leading term is just the general relativistic gravitomagnetic correction .",
    "the lense  thirring effect on the keplerian orbital elements of a test body is currently under measurement in the gravitational field of the earth with the lageos  lageos ii experiment by ciufolini and coworkers , and various efforts aimed to enforce the experimental accuracy of such measurement have been recently carried out .",
    "also the originally proposed lageos ",
    "lares project is currently under revision .",
    "the ambitious gp  b mission , aimed to the detection , among other things , of the gravitomagnetic precession of four freely falling gyroscopes in the gravitational field of the earth , is scheduled to fly in june 2003 .",
    "all the gravitomagnetic effects considered up to now , both theoretically and experimentally , are post  newtonian corrections of order @xmath17 and linear in the angular velocity @xmath8 of the central mass . in this paper",
    "we wish to investigate if it is possible to work out some other gravitomagnetic effects which account for higher powers of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we will work out the effect of the square of the proper angular momentum of a central , weakly gravitating astrophysical object on the coordinate sidereal period of a test body freely orbiting it .",
    "moreover , we will check if such new feature is detectable , according to our knowledge of the earth s space environment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will work out the geodesic motion in a plane containing the spin of the central mass , according to the full kerr metric .",
    "the gravitomagnetic correction to the coordinate period is calculated , as well .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the discussions and the conclusions .",
    "let us consider , for the sake of concreteness , a central body of mass @xmath0 , and proper angular momentum @xmath1 directed along the @xmath18 axis of an asymptotically inertial frame @xmath19 whose origin is located at the center of mass of the body . by adopting , as usual , the boyer - lindquist coordinates |x^0 & = & ct , + x^1 & = & r , + x^2 & = & , + x^3 & = & ,  the components of the kerr space  time metric tensor are |00 & = & 1- , + 11 & = & - , + 22 & = & -^2 , + 33 & = & -^2 , + 03 & = & a_g^2 , with |^2 & = & r^2+a_g^2 ^ 2 , + & = & r^2-r_s r+a_g^2 , + r_s & = & , + a_g & = & .    in the following subsections",
    "we will consider a circular geodesic orbit in an arbitrary approximately fixed azimuthal plane which , in this case , coincides to @xmath20 .",
    "however , it can be neglected over the temporal scale fixed by a typical orbital revolution of a near  earth artificial satellite . indeed , for , e.g. , the lageos satellite the period of the lense  thirring nodal precession amounts to @xmath21 s while its keplerian orbital period is @xmath22 s. ] passing trough the spin of the central body , i.e. we will work at fixed @xmath10 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will first calculate the time @xmath23 required for describing a full polar orbit passing from @xmath24 to @xmath25 as viewed from an asymptotically inertial observer . to this aim",
    ", we will start by considering the radial geodesic equation .",
    "as it is well known , the geodesic equations of motions are + = 0 ,  = 0,1,2,3 in which @xmath26 is the proper time : the christoffel symbols are given by = ( + - ) ,  , , = 0,1,2,3 . since we are working at fixed @xmath10 and @xmath20 , we need only @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it can be easily seen that , since @xmath29 , | & = & -g^11= , + & = & -g^11=-r , + & = & 0 . then , the radial equation yields ( x^0)^2 -r()^2=0,where the overdot stands for the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath26 . by defining the adimensional quantity @xmath30 , from it can be obtained dt = d , where @xmath31 is the keplerian mean motion . the signs + and",
    "- refer to opposite rotations . by neglecting terms of order @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which is well adequate , e.g. , for an artificial satellite orbiting the earth since @xmath34 m",
    ", becomes dt(1+^2 ^ 2)d.by integrating from 0 to 2@xmath35 for the clockwise direction and from 2@xmath35 to 0 for the counterclockwise direction we obtain , for both senses of motion + = t^(0)+=t^(0)+ .",
    "at this point it may be instructive a comparison with the equatorial case for @xmath10 and @xmath36 constant . since for @xmath37 | & = & , + & = & ( -2r+ ) , + & = & - ,",
    "the geodesic radial equation can be written as ( ) ^2 - 2()+(-)=0.from , which has been written without any approximation , it can be straightforwardly obtained in an exact way = , from which the well known result of follows .",
    "notice that the terms in @xmath38 of the diagonal part of the kerr metric entering cancel out in obtaining .",
    "so , in the equatorial case , there is only one general relativistic correction .",
    "it is of order @xmath2 and is linear in @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the general relativistic motion of a test particle along a geodesic , circular orbit lying in a plane containing the proper angular momentum @xmath1 of a central , weakly gravitating body . by assuming that the motion occurs in an almost fixed plane for @xmath10 and @xmath20 constant in the full kerr metric",
    ", we have found that there is a small relativistic correction to the coordinate time @xmath23 required to describe a full orbit .",
    "it is given by .",
    "its main features are the following .",
    "* it is independent of the sense of motion of the test particle on its orbit , contrary to the well known gravitomagnetic correction due to the off  diagonal component of the metric .",
    "this implies , e.g. , that for a pair of counter  rotating test particles on polar orbits there is no gravitomagnetic coordinate time shift @xmath39 * it is an effect of order @xmath2 , as it happens in the off  diagonal case .",
    "however , while is an approximate result at lowest order in @xmath40 , is exact * it depends on the square of the angular velocity of the central body , while the off  diagonal correction is linear in it .",
    "* it depends on the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath12 , the mass @xmath0 of the central body and the radius @xmath10 of the orbit via @xmath41 , contrary to the off  diagonal correction which is independent of them the dependence on @xmath0 is an important point because if it was dependent purely on @xmath38 some doubts could arise on its physical meaning . indeed , every effect dependent only on @xmath38 could be thought as derived from the kerr metric in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "but the diagonal part of the kerr metric for @xmath42 is simply the flat minkowskian space  time written in the spheroidal coordinates |x & = & , + y & = & , + z & = & r * in the limit @xmath43 it reduces to the keplerian period @xmath44 for the asymptotically inertial observer * yields for the gravitomagnetic correction in the field of the earth a value of @xmath45 @xmath46 s)/@xmath47 : for lageos it amounts to @xmath48 s. such a correction is two orders of magnitude smaller than the equatorial gravitomagnetic clock effect @xmath49 .",
    "it is , at present , undetectable , mainly because of the error in the knowledge of the keplerian period , of the order of 10@xmath6 s , caused by the uncertainty in @xmath50 ."
