    "almost two centuries ago , sadi carnot established the maximum efficiency attainable by heat engines in his groundbreaking work on the motive power of heat @xcite .",
    "he did so by considering a simple reversible model ( the carnot cycle ) , which was general enough to account for any specific realization of a steam engine in the limit of _ quasistatic _ operation .",
    "realistic devices , however , need to be operated in finite time and are , therefore , intrinsically irreversible .",
    "thus , in order to address the practical problem of performance optimization of irreversible engines ( or refrigerators ) , better benchmarks , tighter than the carnot bound , must be obtained .",
    "this is the central question of _ finite - time thermodynamics _",
    "@xcite , and addressing it requires to introduce suitable models , simple enough to remain analytically tractable , and still contain all the relevant physics of an irreversible device .",
    "the first attempts relied on _ endoreversible _ models , which assume that finite - rate heat transfer effects yield the leading contribution to the total irreversible entropy production , and disregard completely other naturally occurring irreversible processes such as internal dissipation , friction or heat leaks .",
    "this approximation , originally intended to account for simple turbine models @xcite , has been generically used in the description of heat engines and refrigerators @xcite . however",
    ", a careful analysis shows that the operation of commercial devices is indeed dominated instead by internal dissipation and , to a lesser extent , heat leaks , which advises against its use @xcite .",
    "finite - time thermodynamics has also been applied to _",
    "quantum _ energy conversion cycles , i.e. those embodied in individual quantum systems with discrete energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "these nanoscale heat devices were first studied back in the late 1950s @xcite , when it was pointed out that a three - level maser could be thought - of as the smallest realization of a heat engine , or a compression refrigerator .",
    "interestingly , a weakly driven three - level maser is , in good approximation , endoreversible @xcite , while a three - level absorption chiller or heat transformer ( i.e. driven by heat rather than work ) @xcite is strictly so .",
    "the optimization of this model has been thoroughly studied so as to establish universal endoreversible performance bounds from a full microscopic description of the system - baths interactions @xcite .",
    "very recently , several experiments have been proposed to realize quantum energy conversion devices , such as a heat engine made up of a single trapped ion @xcite , laser - driven two - level chillers @xcite ; or even absorption chillers realized in optomechanical setups @xcite , arrays of coupled quantum dots @xcite , or super - conducting qubits @xcite .",
    "hence , the interest in nanoscale heat devices is starting to transcend the theoretical understanding of the foundations of thermodynamics as their first practical applications start to be envisaged .",
    "just like in the macroscopic realm , realistic nanometer - sized engines and refrigerators are generally not strictly endoreversible @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to predict characteristic parameters such as the maximum cooling coefficient of performance ( cop ) , or to find generic design prescriptions compatible with operation at maximum power ( or cooling rate ) , one needs to come up with a prototype model , complex enough to encompass all the relevant lossy mechanisms other than the unavoidable finite - rate heat transfer effects .",
    "for instance , quantum otto cycles performed _ in finite time _ on interacting two - level atoms were proposed for the study of ` friction ' @xcite , which was identified with the irreversible degradation of residual quantum coherence .",
    "when it comes to continuous models ( i.e. those operating under steady - state conditions ) , it is known that e.g. a weakly - driven three - level chiller does suffer from ` heat leaks ' once the parasitic coupling between its driving transition and the environment is accounted for @xcite . as shown by kosloff and levy in @xcite ,",
    "even perfectly isolated three - level chillers deviate from endoreversibility under strong driving .",
    "this is due to an essentially different type of losses , which result from an internal competition between alternative decay paths .",
    "this losses are accompanied by heat leaks .",
    "interestingly , both internal losses and heat leaks are also present in absence of external driving or imperfect thermal insulation .",
    "indeed , multi - terminal autonomous devices , i.e. those consisting of mutually interacting contact ports locally addressed by independent heat baths , operate irreversibly as a result of ` delocalized dissipation ' @xcite .    in spite of the efforts devoted to the study of irreversibility in nanoscale continuous devices , a complete understanding of its basic underlying mechanisms and their interplay is still missing .",
    "in this paper we intend to fill that gap by showing how a generic quantum heat engine or refrigerator can be thought - of as a ` multi - effect ' device @xcite , made up of _ detuned _ stages that may work cooperatively and , crucially , also compete with each other @xcite .",
    "we generically term this competition ` internal dissipation ' .",
    "heat leaks appear then as a mere by - product , since the combination of such stages facilitates parasitic energy flows between heat baths .",
    "additionally , imperfect insulation at the thermal contacts introduces undesired system - bath couplings that result in a direct bath - to - bath heat transfer or ` thermal short - circuit ' . to carry out our analysis",
    ", we propose a minimal irreversible absorption refrigerator which reduces to a double - stage absorption chiller @xcite , with detuned three - level stages .",
    "we further quantify and compare the individual contributions of internal dissipation and heat leaks to the total irreversible entropy production , and even propose reservoir engineering techniques to partly suppress these detrimental effects and thus , increase the cooling performance .",
    "finally , we show how the basic lossy mechanisms present in our simple model also show up naturally in more complex practical multi - terminal interacting absorption chillers @xcite .",

    "the transition @xmath2 , of frequency @xmath3 , is weakly coupled to a heat bath at temperature @xmath4 via a dissipative thermal contact term of the form @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the corresponding bath operator ( cf .",

    "the temperatures are ordered as @xmath13 .",
    "one may compute the energy currents @xmath14 flowing from each of the heat baths into the system from its ( non - equilibrium ) steady state @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "provided that @xmath16 one has @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "that is , net heat is extracted from the cold bath at temperature @xmath4 and dumped into the hot bath at @xmath11 , with the assistance of extra energy coming from the work bath at @xmath12 .",
    "this realizes a _ quantum absorption chiller _ @xcite .    unless @xmath20 the operation of the chiller is always irreversible , meaning that the total entropy production @xmath21 is strictly positive",
    "this may be understood as a consequence of the ` imperfect thermal contact ' between each transition and its heat bath .",
    "indeed , let us define the _ internal _ temperatures @xmath22 @xcite as @xmath23 where the @xmath24 stand for the steady - state populations in the energy basis .",
    "the equality @xmath25 only holds when @xmath20 @xcite . in that limit @xmath26 and , as a result , the coefficient of performance @xmath27 of the chiller saturates to the carnot cop @xmath28 $ ] @xcite .",

    ", the coupling scheme between the energy eigenstates is shown .",
    "the corresponding energies are indicated on the right - hand side . ]",
    "let us consider the following hamiltonian @xmath32    we couple the transition @xmath33 to the cold bath through a thermal contact operator of the form @xmath34 , the transition @xmath35 , to the hot bath via a term like @xmath36 , and finally @xmath37 , to the work bath with @xmath38 ( see fig .

    "henceforth , while the hot bath only acts on the transition @xmath48 , the work bath is responsible for both the @xmath49 and the @xmath50 processes .",
    "likewise , the cold bath acts on @xmath2 and @xmath7 . we will assume bosonic reservoirs with hamiltonian @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , where @xmath53 stands for the annihilation operator of mode @xmath54 in bath @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we may explicitly write @xmath56 , where the coupling strengths are taken to be @xmath57 so as to yield an ohmic spectral density @xcite .",
    "this is the case for e.g. blackbody radiation .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 sets the dissipation time scale @xmath59 .",
    "we also adopt the usual born - markov and rotating - wave approximations , implying that @xmath60 is by far the largest time scale in the problem . under this assumption one",
    "may readily derive an equation of motion for the state @xmath61 in the standard lindblad - gorini - kossakovski - sudarshan ( lgks ) form @xmath62 @xcite , where the _ dissipators _ @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 stands for anti commutator .",
    "the non - hermitian jump operators @xmath66 result from the decomposition of @xmath67 as eigenoperators of @xmath40 @xcite ( i.e. @xmath68 such that @xmath69=-\\omega\\,a_{\\alpha,\\,\\omega}$ ] ) .",
    "there is only one of them associated with the hot bath ( @xmath70 ) , which contributes to the corresponding dissipator with two terms , at frequencies @xmath71 . on the other hand",

    "with all the above in mind , one only needs to impose stationarity [ i.e. @xmath83 to obtain the non - equilibrium steady state @xmath15 of the four - level system .",
    "the heat currents can be defined as @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "obviously , @xmath85 as a consequence of the stationarity .",
    "also since the dissipators @xmath63 are in the lgks form @xcite , one can show that the irreversible entropy production is non - negative ( @xmath86 ) , as should be expected @xcite .",
    "we now have at our disposal all the elements to carry out a full thermodynamic analysis of the four - level chiller .",
    "we shall use them below for its diagnosis and eventually , for devising a strategy to suppress the internal losses and heat leaks .",
    "heat devices are usually characterized by their power - versus - performance characteristic curves .",
    "endoreversible models feature a distinctive open characteristic curve : when finite - rate heat transfer losses dominate , both the output power and the cop vanish . in the opposite ( reversible ) limit ,",
    "the performance saturates to the carnot cop , albeit at vanishing cooling load [ see orange curves in fig .  [",
    "fig2](a ) ] . on the contrary , more realistic devices affected as well by internal dissipation and heat leaks exhibit typical closed characteristic curves in which power and efficiency always vanish jointly @xcite .",
    "the closed characteristic curves of our four - level absorption chiller , depicted in fig .  [ fig2](a ) in blue , are thus a smoking gun evidence of additional irreversibility .",
    "notice as well that increasing the parameter @xmath87 seems to accentuate this effect .",
    "the aim of this section is to propose a meaningful breakdown of the total heat currents @xmath88 so as to identify the sources of the internal dissipation and parasitic heat transfer .      given a quantum master equation like the one above , one can always tackle the calculation of any physical quantity via the monte - carlo wave function ( mcwf ) method @xcite , that is , as an ensemble average over a sufficiently large number of stochastic trajectories .",
    "these are generated by a suitable piece - wise deterministic dynamics acting on pure states drawn from a given initial probability distribution .",
    "the mcwf method is not only technically convenient for computations involving large dissipative systems @xcite but it may also provide physical insights which would be hard to gasp from averaged quantities .",
    "in particular , the static viewpoint of the system _ frozen _ at @xmath15 may be replaced by a dynamical one : that of a large number of time - evolving energy eigenstates drawn from the stationary distribution @xmath89",
    ". note that the state is written here in the energy eigenbasis @xmath90 , rather than @xmath91 .",
    "the dynamics along each trajectory would then consist of a sequence of independent random jumps between the different energy eigenstates of the system , at the constant jump rates @xmath92 .    from the specific dissipative couplings of our four - level chiller , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , it is easy to see that any _ closed _ stochastic trajectory ( i.e. starting and finishing at the same energy eigenstate ) , either falls into one of the following six categories , or is a permutation of combinations thereof :    1 .",

    "when it comes to processes c1/c2 and c3/c4 these may either work cooperatively or compete with each other . for @xmath95 the rates of c1 and c3 are both larger than those of c2 and c4 ; that is    @xmath96    hence , the two processes cooperate producing net cooling , pretty much like the different stages in a multi - effect quantum absorption chiller @xcite . however , in the range @xmath97 , the rate of c2 exceeds that of c1 while c3 is still more likely to occur than c4 .",
    "this means that the couple c3/c4 cools on average , as opposed to c1/c2 , which produces net heating .",
    "this competition between cooling and heating mechanisms makes it impossible for the chiller to operate reversibly , and could be tagged ` internal dissipation ' as it provides the leading contribution to the irreversible entropy production at @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and the discussion in sec .  [ s_breakdown_of_the_steady_state_heat_currents ] ) .",
    "for @xmath98 , both c1/c2 and c3/c4 operate as heat transformers on average so that cooling is no longer possible .",
    "this is exactly the same mechanism that renders a periodically - driven three - level engine irreversible @xcite .",
    "we shall formalize this intuition below , by suitably decomposing the steady - state heat currents of our four - level chiller into contributions corresponding to two _ detuned _ elementary endoreversible stages , and an additional purely irreversible heat leak stage operating in parallel .",
    "let us introduce now the steady - state heat currents @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , where the rates @xmath103 are given by    @xmath104    one can easily check that @xmath105 for all three baths .",
    "the thermodynamic consistency of these newly - introduced _",
    "stages _ contributing to the total steady - state heat currents , follows from the fact that they individually sum up to zero ( i.e. @xmath106 ) , and also satisfy the second - law - like inequalities @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we may associate the stage @xmath110 to the combined processes c1/c2 , as the sign of @xmath111 is determined by the imbalance between the stationary rates of processes c1 and c2 [ cf .",
    "eqs .   and ] .",
    "similarly , the sets of steady - state heat currents @xmath112 and @xmath113 may be linked to processes c3/c4 and c5/c6 , respectively .",
    "the ` plus stage ' behaves as an absorption chiller ( i.e. @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) within the _ cooling window _",
    "@xmath117 , while the ` minus stage ' does , provided that @xmath118 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the heat leak rate @xmath119 is always negative since @xmath120 .",
    "this entails a parasitic heat current flowing directly from the work bath into the cold bath .",
    "since we set @xmath121 , the heat leaks will be typically negligible in comparison with the other contributions .",
    "also note that as @xmath87 increases , the cooling window for the plus stage shrinks while , for the minus stage , it is instead shifted as a whole towards larger frequencies .",
    "thus , if we were to allow @xmath87 to become larger than @xmath122 , the plus stage would not be capable of producing net cooling at _ any _ @xmath123 , and the four - level chiller could ultimately lose its ability to cool .    just like in the case of the three - level chiller , the internal temperatures @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , defined from the steady - state populations @xmath127 in the energy basis as @xmath128 coincide with the equilibrium temperatures of the reservoirs only at @xmath129 . at that point",
    ", the plus stage operates reversibly ( @xmath130 ) , i.e. at the carnot cop .",
    "similarly , defining the internal temperatures @xmath131 from @xmath132 one can see that the equalities @xmath133 and @xmath134 hold at @xmath135",
    ". however , the irreversible entropy production associated to the heat leak stage @xmath136 never vanishes . that would require both @xmath137 _ and _ @xmath138 to hold simultaneously , which is not possible for any @xmath139 .",
    "[ fig2](b ) shows the behaviour of the different shares of the total irreversible entropy production ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath136 ) in the neighbourhood of @xmath20 .",
    "we can see that even if a non - vanishing @xmath136 alone is enough to render the device overall irreversible , the leading detrimental effect comes from the mismatch between @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "also note that the larger the @xmath87 , the larger the mismatch and , consequently , the bigger the resulting irreversibility at @xmath122 .",
    "this explains why increasing @xmath87 lowers the maximum attainable cop in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .          generalizing the above",
    ", we can say that a thermodynamic cooling cycle will feature irreversibility provided that two ( or more ) energy - basis transitions at different frequencies are allowed by the coupling to two ( or more ) heat baths .",
    "the dissipative transitions of such system may always be grouped to form coupled detuned three - level stages , which gives rise to _ both _ internal dissipation and heat leaks as illustrated above .",
    "an essentially different scenario is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where irreversibility was modeled as the parasitic coupling of e.g. the cold bath to the work transition in a three - level maser .",
    "this would provide the chiller with an alternative dissipative path besides the conventional cooling and heating cycles @xmath144 ; that is , the _ shortcut _ @xmath145 . as a result",
    ", heat could leak between the work and cold bath without producing any cooling . while the former effect is mere a by - product of internal dissipation , rooted in the interactions facilitating energy transfer within the working substance ,",
    "the origin of this latter type of heat leaks , which we may tag ` thermal short circuit ' , lies simply in the lack of proper insulation at the thermal contacts of the device .",
    "realizable nanoscale absorption chillers will typically be multi - terminal interacting devices , thus suffering from internal dissipation and heat leaks",
    ". however , thermal short circuit effects may also be unavoidable in practice , and could play a major role in the buildup of irreversible entropy production .      from the above analysis",
    "it follows that the overall operation of the four - level chiller can be made endoreversible by inhibiting either the plus or the minus stage .",
    "let us imagine for instance that the spectrum of the work bath could be tailored into a debye shape , with a high frequency cutoff @xmath146 anywhere between @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the corresponding excitation - relaxation rates would then read @xmath149\\,\\theta(\\omega_{w,\\text{max}}-\\vert\\omega\\vert)$ ] , where @xmath150 stands for the heaviside step function . as a result ,",
    "the stationary rates associated with the transition @xmath49 would vanish , thus precluding processes c3/c4 and c5/c6 , and cancelling their contributions to the total irreversible entropy production .",
    "such engineered four - level chiller can operate reversibly at @xmath151 , as showcased by its open characteristic curve , plotted in orange in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the markov approximation , which is central to our analysis , assumes that the decay of the two - time correlations of the baths is sufficiently fast compared with the dissipation time - scale .",
    "this assumption is justified so long as the spectral density remains approximately flat in the neighbourhood of the relevant bohr frequencies of the system .",
    "thus , for small @xmath87 , the cutoff would be typically too close to @xmath147 for the markov approximation to be valid . as a result ,",
    "both the actual time - evolution and the subsequent stationary state might differ significantly from the ones predicted by the lgks quantum master equation .",
    "a rigorous treatment of such problem requires more sophisticated tools , like higher order perturbative quantum master equations @xcite , non - markovian stochastic schrdinger equations @xcite , hierarchical heisenberg equations @xcite , or other non - perturbative methods @xcite .",
    "while the quantitative assessment of the performance of irreversible devices operating between engineered reservoirs is definitely worthy of investigation , it lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , from the simple physical picture sketched above one may still propose practical means to minimize the detrimental effects of heat leaks and internal dissipation .",
    "for instance , rather than connecting the transition @xmath37 directly to the work bath , one could interpose a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath152 between the two , so as to realize a frequency filter : the spectral density would then effectively look like a _ skewed _ lorentzian around @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "this reservoir - engineering technique has been recently considered in the context of nanoscale heat devices to produce spectrally - separated heat baths @xcite .",
    "adjusting the detuning @xmath153 and the transition - oscillator coupling , one can easily find instances in which @xmath154 , which strongly reduces the rate of the minus stage in favour of the plus stage , and may thus allow for significantly larger cooling cops .",
    "we now turn our attention to a more complex three - terminal absorption chiller @xcite .",

    "this hints that heat leaks could be at least partly responsible for the irreversibility . as pointed out in ref .",

    "one may easily identify the direction of the leaks by just _ pairing off _ these elementary three - level stages to yield either of the three configuration of the irreversible four - level chiller .",
    "in particular , notice that in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we have split the dissipative transitions of the three - qubit chiller into six coupled irreversible cycles , labelled with lowercase roman numerals .",
    "one recognizes the transition diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in stages ( i ) and ( ii ) . in turn , stages ( iii ) and ( iv ) correspond to the configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , and stages ( v ) and ( vi ) , to that of fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "hence , we can conclude that this device suffers from all three types of pairwise heat leaks .",
    "however , for small @xmath87 , it is again the mismatch in the cooling windows of the detuned three - level stages which contributes with the largest share to the total irreversible entropy production .",
    "performance optimization would demand , in this case , to engineer the coupling to both the work and the hot baths .",
    "for instance , setting high - frequency cutoffs anywhere between @xmath171 and @xmath9 in the spectrum of the hot bath , and between @xmath147 and @xmath172 in the spectrum of the work bath , suppresses all three - level stages except for the two that connect states @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "these are resonant and uncoupled , and the resulting device is therefore strictly endoreversible .",
    "we have thus showcased how one may diagnose a complex autonomous heat device , and even propose generic strategies to optimize its performance , without ever having to solve for its steady - state heat currents .",
    "the ultimate efficiency at maximum power that can be achieved by nanoscale heat devices has been object of intense study @xcite . in particular , for endoreversible single and multi - stage devices it has been established that the cop at maximum cooling load ( @xmath176 ) is _ tightly _ bounded from above as a result of the constraints imposed by the specific system - bath interaction mechanism @xcite . in particular , for unstructured bosonic baths , this bound is only set by the dimensionality of the heat reservoirs ( e.g. @xmath177 for 3d baths ) @xcite .",
    "whether the performance bound also applies to irreversible ( ` non - ideal ' ) chiller models such as the three - qubit chiller was investigated via global numerical optimization in ref .",
    "we are now in the position to give simple arguments to justify why the bound overestimates the maximum performance for any finite internal interaction strength .    for simplicity , we turn our attention to the four - level chiller , though similar arguments apply as well to the three - qubit model . as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ s_breakdown_of_the_steady_state_heat_currents ] , the contribution of the heat leak component to the total steady - state heat currents and irreversible entropy production is rather small , so that one may approximate @xmath178 . in particular ,",
    "the power of each stage @xmath179 will peak at a different frequency @xmath180 , and feature a cop of @xmath181 .",
    "however , the total cooling load @xmath182 will peak at some @xmath183 , so that one has the strict inequalities @xmath184 .",
    "the overall cop at maximum cooling power may be thus approximated as @xmath185 which is _ strictly below _",
    "the endoreversible bound for unstructured baths . in fact , is it easy to check that increasing the interaction strength @xmath87 gradually lowers the actual bound on @xmath176 . of course",
    ", if one is allowed to optimize @xmath176 globally ( i.e. over all parameters ) , the endoreversible bound will tighten for vanishingly small interactions @xmath87 .",
    "this is a neat example of why one should be careful not to extend results obtained within the endoreversible approximation to generic irreversible devices .",
    "especial care is in order when dealing with performance optimization , as endoreversibility typically leads to gross overestimations of the cop .",
    "in this paper we have identified and characterized the mechanisms producing internal dissipation and heat leaks in nanoscale autonomous energy - conversion devices .",
    "these effects are severely detrimental to their energy - efficient operation and relate closely to each other .",
    "they arise whenever it becomes possible for one or more heat baths to excite two or more transitions of the working substance , at _ different _ frequencies . to that end , we have introduced and solved a minimal model of four - level irreversible absorption chiller . in particular , we have split its steady - state heat currents into three contributions : two of them which correspond to coupled endoreversible three - level stages operating in parallel , and another one which facilitates direct heat leaks from one heat bath into another .",
    "we have shown that , since the two endoreversible stages are detuned , there is a range of parameters for which they compete with each other instead of working cooperatively .",
    "it is precisely the mismatch in the cooling windows of these two stages which ultimately produces the largest share to the total irreversible entropy production as the coefficient of performance grows .",
    "we have generically termed this effect ` internal dissipation ' to differentiate it from the mere bath - to - bath parasitic heat leaks .",
    "we have also proposed the suppression of either of the two constituent three - level cycles of this irreversible model , via reservoir - engineering techniques , as a means to increase its maximum achievable coefficient of performance .",
    "finally , we have shown how , aided by this qualitative understanding about the origin of irreversibility in autonomous heat devices , one may be able to classify the sources of irreversible entropy production of more complex models of absorption chiller , e.g. determine the direction of the heat leaks ; and even to develop an intuition about potentially successful reservoir engineering techniques , to be implemented so as to allow for larger performance .",
    "a quantitative measure of the actual improvement in chiller performance achieved , for instance , by introducing fine - tuned frequency filters at the thermal contacts , calls for a more careful modelling of the dissipative interactions beyond the common markovian approximation .",
    "it is certainly in order to pursue this research direction further , as it could ultimately pave the way towards a theory of thermal engineering at the nanoscale , with foreseeable widespread applications to quantum technologies .",
