    "<S> this can be explained ( see sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : cubeshape ] ) by finding the modulation of the energy of an arbitrary tetrahedral state as a function of the orientation of the corresponding tetrahedron : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the angles between the @xmath23-axis and three body - axes @xmath29 fixed to the tetrahedron ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the orientations that minimize this energy are the true ground states at nonzero @xmath6 . if @xmath26 ( assumed until sec . </S>",

    "<S> this vortex has an excess energy ( relative to the ground state energy of the condensate ) which diverges with the condensate size . in fact , its zeeman energy density ( with @xmath69 subtracted ) is given according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : effective ] ) by s for this vortex may be calculated by noting that , relative to the tetrahedron , the @xmath23-axis of space rotates @xmath64 about @xmath65 so that @xmath70 , its coordinates relative to the body axes of the tetrahedron are easy to work out as functions of @xmath71 . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 the tetrahedron is pointing in the wrong direction except along the positive and negative @xmath73-axis ; and the integrated energy is proportional to the area : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the condensate s radius </S>",

    "<S> the vortex described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bisect ] ) can form a partnership with another vortex of the same type , producing a molecule that can exist without costing too much energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the net charge of the two vortices is compatible with the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of two @xmath64 rotations of the tetrahedral order parameter about the @xmath65 axis is a @xmath76 rotation about the @xmath65-axis , but since any rotation axis is a @xmath76 symmetry of the tetrahedron , the rotation axis on circles of radius @xmath77 enclosing the vortices can be tilted continuously relative to the tetrahedron as @xmath77 increases until it becomes the @xmath75 axis instead . </S>",

    "<S> increasing the molecule size decreases the kinetic energy and increases the zeeman energy . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium size @xmath79 is determined by minimizing the sum . ]    the zeeman energy in the region around the vortices , where the tetrahedra are still tilted , may be estimated by replacing the total condensate size @xmath75 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : misalign ] ) by the diameter @xmath79 of this region . </S>",
    "<S> the zeeman energy tries to pull the vortices toward one another but the elastic energy cost of rapid changes in the order parameter ( the gradient term in the hamiltonian ) opposes this tendency : the tetrahedra rotate twice as fast around circles beyond @xmath79 , where the two vortices act in concert . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the elastic energy increases as @xmath79 becomes smaller ; this leads to the coulomb repulsion between the vortices , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the mass of the atoms in the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the vortex molecule is therefore @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a numerical constant . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium size can be determined by minimizing over @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic zeeman force binds this molecule together while the repulsion keeps the vortices from merging .    </S>",
    "<S> if the vortices _ were _ to coalesce , then they could react to form a set of vortices that are not bound by the zeeman energy ; one possible set of decay products is three vortices each involving a rotation through @xmath84 about the @xmath75 axis ( which have the same net @xmath76 rotation as the original pair of vortices ) . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex molecule of the two @xmath65 rotations is _ metastable _ because thermal fluctuations may overcome their coulomb repulsion and push them together , leading to such a fission process .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of this paper elaborates : it gives a qualitatively correct expression for the spin texture surrounding the molecule just described and determines how this molecule _ actually _ decays . in order to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we will give some more general results : first section [ sec : dali ] , summarizes the non - commutative group theory of combining vortex charges and a classification of the tetrahedral vortices ( the vortices that occur by themselves when @xmath14 and in clusters when @xmath16 ) ; then section [ sec : carnot ] estimates the elastic energies and zeeman energies of such clusters as functions of these vortex charges ; finally section [ sec : lavoisier ] gives criteria determining which types of tetrahedral vortices form bound states or metastable states ( see section [ sec : metastable ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the last two sections illustrate the criteria with a few additional surprising examples ( see section [ sec : sampler ] ) and give some basic ideas about how to observe metastable vortices ( section [ sec : fieldwork ] ) . </S>"
