    "it has become a generally agreed concept that the euv dimming observed during the onset of a _ coronal mass ejection ( cme ) _ manifests the coronal mass loss of the cme , and thus we basically expect a one - to - one correlation between the detections of cmes and euv dimmings , unless there exist special circumstances . for instance , the cme could originate behind the limb , in which case the euv dimming is obscured , or the cme could start in the upper corona , where there is little euv emission because of the gravitational stratification .",
    "the latter case would imply very low masses compared with a cme that originates at the base of the corona , i.e. , @xmath0 at two thermal scale heights .",
    "however , there exists a case with an average cme mass that did not leave any footprints behind in euv ( robbrecht et al .",
    "a statistical study on the simultaneous detection of euv dimmings and cmes has recently been performed by bewsher et al .",
    "this study based on soho / cds and lasco data confirms a 55% association rate of dimming events with cmes , and vice versa a 84% association rate of cmes with dimming events",
    ". some of the non - associated events may be subject to occultation , cme detection sensitivity , or incomplete temperature coverage in euv and soft x - rays .",
    "perhaps the cme - dimming association rate will reach 100% once the stereo spacecraft arrive at a separation of @xmath1 and cover all equatorial latitudes of the sun .",
    "a number of studies have been carried out by using the detection of coronal dimming to identify cme source regions , focusing on transient coronal holes caused by filament eruptions ( rust 1983 ; watanabe et al .",
    "1992 ) , euv dimming at cme onsets ( harrison 1997 ; aschwanden et al .",
    "1999 ) , soft x - ray dimming after cmes ( sterling & hudson 1997 ) , soft x - ray dimming after a prominence eruption ( gopalswamy & hanaoka 1998 ) , simultaneous dimming in soft x - rays and euv during cme launches ( zarro et al .  1999 ; harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al .",
    "2003 ) , determinations of cme masses from euv dimming from spectroscopic data ( harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al .",
    "2003 ) or from euv imaging data ( zhukov and auchere 2004 ; aschwanden et al .",
    "all these studies support the conclusion that dimmings in the corona ( either detected in euv , soft x - rays , or both ) are unmistakable signatures of cme launches , and thus can be used vice versa to identify the mutual phenomena .    in this study here",
    "we attempt for the first time to model the kinematics of a cme and the resulting euv dimming quantitatively , which provides us unique physical parameters of the cme source region and on the cme kinematics in the initial acceleration phase .",
    "the dynamics of a cme can often be characterized by a rapid expansion of a magnetically unstable coronal volume that expands from the lower corona upward into the heliosphere .",
    "different shapes have been used to approximately describe the 3d geometry of a cme , such as a spherical bubble , an ice - cone , a crescent , or a helical flux rope , which expand in a self - similar fashion and approximately maintain the aspect ratio in vertical and horizontal directions during the initial phase of the expansion . here",
    "we develop a four - dimensional ( 4d=3d+t ) model that describes the 3d evolution of the cme geometry in time ( t ) in terms of 4d electron density distributions @xmath2 that allow us also to predict and forward - fit a corresponding euv intensity image data cube @xmath3 in an observed wavelength .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we start in our model here with the simplest case , assuming : ( 1 ) spherical 3d geometry for the cme front and cavity ; ( 2 ) self - similar expansion in time ; ( 3 ) density compression in the cme front and adiabatic volume expansion in the cme cavity ; ( 4 ) mass conservation for the sum of the cme front , cavity , and external coronal volume ; ( 5 ) hydrostatic ( gravitational stratification ) or super - hydrostatic density scale heights ; ( 6 ) line - tying condition for the magnetic field at the cme base ; and ( 7 ) a magnetic driving force that is constant during the time interval of the initial expansion phase .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the traditional characterization of a typical cme morphology in three parts , including a cme front ( leading edge ) , a cavity , and a filament ( although we do not model the filament part ) .",
    "the expanding cme bubble sweeps up the coronal plasma that appears as a bright rim at the observed `` cme front '' or leading edge .",
    "the interior of the cme bubble exhibits a rapid decrease in electron density due to the adiabatic expansion , which renders the inside of the cme bubble darker in euv and appears as the observed `` cme cavity '' .",
    "the assumption of adiabatic expansion implies no mass and energy exchange across the outer cme boundary , and thus is consistent with the assumption of a low plasma @xmath4-parameter in the corona with perfect magnetic confinement , while the cme bubble will become leaking in the outer corona and heliosphere , where the plasma @xmath4-parameter exceeds unity ( not included in our model here ) .",
    "a spherical 3d geometry can be characterized by one single free parameter , the radius @xmath5 of the sphere .",
    "the self - similar expansion maintains the spherical shape , so the boundary of the cme bubble can still be parameterized by a single time - dependent radius @xmath6 .",
    "the time - dependence of the cme expansion is controlled by magnetic forces , e.g. , by a lorentz force or hoop force . for sake of simplicity",
    "we assume a constant force during the initial phase of the cme expansion , which corresponds to a constant acceleration @xmath7 and requires three free parameters ( @xmath8 ) to characterize the radial cme expansion , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the initial radius at starting time @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the initial velocity and @xmath7 is the acceleration of the radial expansion .    for the motion of the cme centroid at height @xmath13 we assume a similar quadratic parameterization , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the initial height at starting time @xmath11 , @xmath16 is the initial velocity and @xmath17 is the acceleration of the vertical motion .",
    "this parameterization is consistent with a fit to a theoretical mhd simulation of a breakout cme ( lynch et al .",
    "2004 ) as well as with kinematic fits to observed cmes ( byrne et al .",
    "2009 ) .    , the outer radius of the cme sphere is @xmath6 , and the inner radius of the cme front is @xmath18 .",
    "these parameters increase quadratically with time .",
    "the circular footpoint area of the cme with radius @xmath19 stays invariant during the self - similar expansion in order to satisfy the line - tying condition of the coronal magnetic field at the footpoints.,width=313 ]    further we constrain the cme geometry with a cylindrical footpoint area of radius @xmath19 , which connects from the solar surface to the lowest part of the spherical cme bubble . in order to ensure magnetic line - tying at the footpoints ,",
    "the cme bubble should always be located above the cyclidrical footpoint base , which requires that the initial height satisfies @xmath20 and the acceleration constants are @xmath21 .",
    "we visualize the model geometry in fig . 1 .",
    "the time - invariant cme footprint area allows us a simple mass estimate of the cme from the cylindrical volume integrated over a vertical scale height , since the spherical cme bubble will eventually move to large heights with no additional mass gain ( at time @xmath22 , see right - hand panel in fig.1 ) .    assuming adiabatic expansion inside the cme cavity , the electron density in the confined plasma decreases reciprocally to the expanding volume , i.e. , @xmath23 so it drops with the third power as a function of time from the initial value @xmath24 ( of the average density inside the cme ) .    for the mass distribution inside the cme",
    "we distinguish between a compression region at the outer envelope , containing the cme front , and a rarefaction region in the inside , which is also called cme cavity .",
    "we define an average width @xmath25 of the cme front that is assumed to be approximately constant during the self - similar expansion of the cme .",
    "while the radius @xmath6 demarcates the outer radius of the cme front , we denote the inner radius of the cme front or the radius of the cavity with @xmath18 , @xmath26 which has an initial value of @xmath27 .",

    "the total mass @xmath36 of the plasma that is swept up from the external corona in a cme corresponds to the total cme volume @xmath37 minus the initial volume of the cme cavity , @xmath38 \\\\          & = m_p < n_e > { 4 \\over 3 } \\pi [ r(t)^3 - r_0 ^ 3 ]       \\end{array } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the mass of the hydrogen atom and @xmath40 is the electron density in the external corona averaged over the cme volume . the same mass has to be contained inside the volume @xmath41 of the cme front , @xmath42      \\end{array } \\ , \\ ] ] thus , mass conservation yields a ratio of the average electron density @xmath43 in the cme front and the average external density @xmath40 of @xmath44 this density ratio amounts to unity at the initial time , i.e. , @xmath45 and monotonically increases with time . the maximum value of the density jump in mhd shocks derived from the _ rankine - hugoniot relations _",

    "the combination of projection effects and gravitational stratification predict a brighter rim on the west side , where we look through a longer and denser column depth tangentially to the cme bubble , which is not apparent in the observations of euvi / b . instead , there is more bright emission just above the eastern limb that can not be reproduced by the model .",
    "apparently there exists stronger density compression on the eastern side of the cme bubble than the model predicts .",
    "another inconsistency is the bright loop seen in euvi / b at 18:51 ut , which does not match the surface of the modeled cme sphere as constrained by euvi / a .",

    "moreover , the mass detected in 171 amounts only to about a third of the total cme mass ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2009b ) , so a more realistic estimate of the total cme mass is about a factor 6 higher than our lower limit , i.e. , @xmath141 g , which brings it into the ballpark of previous cme mass determinations of this particular event , i.e. , @xmath142 g from stereo / cor-2 white - light observations ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) , or @xmath143 g from stereo / euvi observations ( aschwanden et al .",
    "we developed an analytical 4d model that simulates the cme expansion and euv dimming in form of a time sequence of euv images that can directly be fitted to stereoscopic observations of stereo / euvi .",
    "the dynamic evolution of the cme is characterized by a self - similar adiabatic expansion of a spherical cme shell , containing a bright front with density compression and a cavity with density rarefaction , satisfying mass conservation of the cme and ambient corona .",

    "the model is able to track the true 3d motion and expansion of the cme by stereoscopic triangulation and yields an acceleration of @xmath144 m s@xmath98 for both the vertical centroid motion and radial expansion during the first half hour after cme launch .",
    "fitting the euv dimming region of the model to the data mostly constrains the coronal base density in the cme region ( @xmath145 @xmath123 ) and the density scale height , which was found to be super - hydrostatic by a factor of @xmath136 .",
    "the average cme expansion speed during the first 10 minutes is approximately @xmath146 km s@xmath104 , similar to the propagation speeds measured for eit waves in the initial phase ( i.e. , @xmath147 km s@xmath104 , veronig et al . 2008 ; @xmath148 km s@xmath104 , long et al .",
    "2008 ; @xmath149 km s@xmath104 , patsourakos et al . 2009 ) , and thus the cme expansion speed seems to be closely related to the associated propagation kinematics of eit waves .",
    "the derived base density , scale height , and footpoint area constrain the cme mass , but accurate estimates require a more complete temperature coverage with other euv filters ( e.g. , see aschwanden et al .",
    "2009b ) . 5 .",
    "the width and density compression factor of the cme front are also constrained by our model , but accurate values require a perfectly homogeneous cme shell . 6 .",
    "while the spherical shell geometry reproduces the euvi / a observations well , significant deviations are noted in the euvi / b observations , indicating substantial inhomogeneities in the cme shell , possibly requiring a hybrid model of bubble and flux rope geometries .",
    "the most important conclusion of this modeling study is that euv dimming can be understood in a quantitative manner and that it provides a direct measurement of the coronal mass loss of a cme .",
    "this exercise has shown that the spherical shell geometry can reproduce a number of observed features of an evolving cme , which constrains the physical and kinematic parameters of the initial phase of the cme launch , but reveals also significant deviations that require a modification of the idealized homogeneous spherical shell model .",
    "the method of analytical 4d models with forward - fitting to stereoscopic euv images appears to be a promising tool to investigate quantitatively the kinematics of cmes . combining with simultaneous magnetic or mhd modeling",
    "may further constrain the physical parameters and ultimately provide the capability to discriminate between different theoretical cme models .",
    "full 4d modeling of the initial cme expansion may also provide a self - consistent treatment of eit waves and cme expansion ( e.g. , chen et al . 2005 ) , for which we find similar kinematic parameters .",
