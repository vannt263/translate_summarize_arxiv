    "using the @xmath0 splitting of spacetime associated with an observer congruence @xmath1 ( timelike , unit tangent vector to the congruence ) , the bianchi identities for the curvature tensor can be cast into a maxwell - like form for the electric and magnetic parts of the weyl tensor with sources arising from the ricci tensor terms , in turn re - expressed in terms of the energy - momentum tensor of the spacetime through the einstein field equations @xcite .    for the stationary case with @xmath1 directed along the timelike killing vector field ,",
    "these equations are greatly simplified and suggested the introduction of the ( complex ) simon @xcite and simon - mars tensors @xcite .",
    "the simon tensor was introduced for vacuum stationary spacetimes as a complex generalization of the cotton - york tensor @xcite , to which it reduces in the static case .",
    "the simon - mars tensor , instead , is a natural algebraic combination of the self - dual fields associated with the papapetrou field of the timelike killing vector field and the weyl tensor . in the vacuum case the bianchi identities state the equivalence between these two tensors , and the vanishing of the simon - mars tensor has been understood as corresponding to the alignment of the principal null directions of the weyl tensor of the spacetime with those of the papapetrou field associated with the timelike killing congruence .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the case of the kerr solution , uniquely characterized by the vanishing of the simon ( and simon - mars ) tensor .    in the nonvacuum case the equivalence between the simon and the simon - mars tensor",
    "is broken because of the presence of ricci tensor terms in the bianchi identities which may be re - expressed in terms of the source energy - momentum tensor by the einstein equations . to characterize exact solutions in a way similar way to the vacuum case",
    ", one approach would be to study these distinct tensors to explore their meaning .",
    "alternatively , one can absorb the source terms into a redefinition of the simon tensor so that the resulting generalized simon tensor equals the simon - mars tensor , which continues to have a clear geometrical meaning . in this more geometrically motivated case , one can classify exact solutions studying only the vanishing of a single tensor . here",
    "we apply these considerations to electrovac stationary spacetimes which contain a source - free electromagnetic field @xcite and stationary spacetimes containing a rigidly rotating perfect fluid@xcite .",
    "the bianchi identities of the second kind equate the divergence of the weyl curvature tensor @xmath2 to half the cotton tensor @xcite , which can be thought of as a current in analogy with electromagnetism @xcite ( where @xmath3 ) [ current ] c^ _ ; = - _ [ ( ^(4)r^ _ ] -16 ^(4)r ^ _ ] ) j^ _  , following the conventions of misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite , including the signature @xmath4 .",

    "of course once the ricci tensor in the source term @xmath33 is replaced using the einstein equations ( [ eq : eericci ] ) , this equality between simon and simon - mars is only true if they are each evaluated on a solution of those equations , in contrast to the vacuum case where they are identically equal for any metric . with this understanding",
    "there is no longer any need to use two different names , simon and simon - mars , to denote the same quantity .",
    "it is worth noting further that this identification has a true geometrical content .",
    "in fact , the vanishing of the simon - mars tensor ( @xmath34 ) is equivalent to the alignment of @xmath25 and @xmath24 , in the sense that @xmath24 must be proportional to the tracefree tensor product of @xmath25 with itself @xcite z [ zz]^(tf )  . of course ,",
    "other generalizations of simon(vacuum ) can also be studied .",

    "for example , when @xmath35 , then the scurl identity for any scalar @xmath36 and any symmetric spatial 2-tensor @xmath37 = -a + a enables this current to be incorporated into the existing scurl term [ eq : simonsigma ] simon = ( /m )  .",
    "this again would re - establish the vacuum property that the simon tensor is proportional to a scurl .",
