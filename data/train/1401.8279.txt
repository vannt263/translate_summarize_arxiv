    "asteroseismology provides an important tool to test and improve stellar models .",
    "it allows to deduce the interior stellar structure , such as the internal rotation profile and the extent of the core due to convective overshooting .",
    "eclipsing binaries , on the other hand , give valuable constraints on the global fundamental parameters , like mass and radius .",
    "thus , they provide crucial input for the seismic modeling of pulsating stars in binary systems .",
    "we selected a sample of eight targets out of the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalogue ( borucki , @xcite ; slawson , @xcite ) based on the shape of the eclipses and clear pulsation - like variations in the light curves . in 2013 we gathered high - resolution spectra with the hermes spectrograph ( raskin , @xcite ) at mercator telescope ( la palma , spain ) to confirm the binarity .",
    "we calculated the radial velocities by cross correlation . for three targets we did not detect any periodic variations in the radial velocity measurements ( see fig.[f_353_456 ] and fig.[f_109 ] )",
    "therefore , we conclude that these stars are not binaries .",
    "single stars can exhibit eclipse like signals in _ kepler _",
    "observations due to , e.g. , background contamination or electronic crosstalk ( bryson , @xcite ) .          for kic10960993 with a period of 3.12d ( slawson , @xcite).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "as a next step we will conduct detailed studies of the pulsations and binarity of the remaining targets of our sample and aim to perform asteroseismology .    based on observations made with the mercator telescope , operated on the island of la palma by the flemish community , at the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias and obtained with the hermes spectrograph , which is supported by the fund for scientific research of flanders ( fwo ) , belgium , the research council of ku leuven , belgium , the fonds national recherches scientific ( fnrs ) , belgium , the royal observatory of belgium , the observatoire de genve , switzerland and the thringer landessternwarte tautenburg , germany .",
