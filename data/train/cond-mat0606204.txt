    "structural and thermodynamic properties of solid helium have been of continuous interest in condensed matter physics because of its quantum nature and electronic simplicity .",
    "in fact , solid helium is in many respects an archetypal `` quantum solid , '' where zero - point energy and associated anharmonic effects are appreciably larger than in most known solids .",
    "this gives rise to peculiar properties , whose understanding has presented a challence for elaborated theories and modelling from a microscopic standpoint @xcite . among these properties , the behavior of condensed helium at high density has received much attention .",
    "in fact , diamond - anvil - cell and shock - wave experiments have allowed to study the equation of state ( eos ) of solid helium up to pressures on the order of 50 gpa @xcite . in last years",
    ", the effect of pressure on heavier rare - gas solids has also been of interest for both experimentalists @xcite and theorists @xcite .",
    "anharmonic effects in solids , and in solid helium in particular , have been traditionally studied by using theoretical techniques such as quasiharmonic approximations and self - consistent phonon theories @xcite . in more recent years",

    "monte carlo sampling applied to evaluate finite - temperature path integrals allows one to carry out quantitative and nonperturbative studies of highly - anharmonic effects in solids @xcite .",
    "the path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique has been used to study several properties of solid helium @xcite , as well as heavier rare - gas solids @xcite . for helium , in particular , this method has predicted kinetic - energy values @xcite and debye - waller factors @xcite in good agreement with data derived from experiments @xcite .",
    "pimc simulations were also employed to study the isotopic shift in the helium melting pressure @xcite .",
    "the eos of solid helium at t = 0 has been studied by diffusion monte carlo in a wide density range ( down to a molar volume of 15 cm@xmath0/mol ) , using an accurate interatomic potential @xcite .",
    "this has been done by chang and boninsegni @xcite at finite temperatures for both solid and liquid helium , by using pimc simulations with several interatomic potentials , and for molar volumes down to 2.6 cm@xmath0/mol .",
    "these authors suggested that the use of effective potentials including two- and three - body terms alone can be insufficient to reproduce the eos of condensed helium , in the pressure range experimentally accessible at present .    in this paper , we study the effect of pressure on solid @xmath0he and @xmath1he by pimc simulations .",
    "we employ the isothermal - isobaric ( @xmath2 ) ensemble , which allows us to consider properties of these solids along well - defined isobars .",
    "the interatomic interaction is described by a combination of two- and three - body terms , which are directly included in the simulations .",
    "this permits us to check results of earlier simulations , where the effect of three - body terms was taken into account in a perturbative way @xcite . by comparing results for @xmath0he and @xmath1he ,",

    "the computational method is described . in sec.iii",
    "we present results for the equation of state , vibrational energy , and isotopic effects on the lattice parameters .",
    "finally , sec.iv includes a discussion of the results and the conclusions .",
    "equilibrium properties of solid helium in the face - centred cubic ( fcc ) and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) phases have been calculated by pimc simulations in the @xmath2 ensemble . most of our simulations were performed on supercells of the fcc and hcp unit cells , including 500 and 432 helium atoms respectively . to check the convergence of our results with system size",
    ", some simulations were carried out for other supercell sizes , and it was found that finite - size effects for @xmath9 atoms are negligible for the quantities studied here ( they are smaller than the error bars ) .",
    "helium atoms have been treated as quantum particles interacting through an effective interatomic potential , composed of a two - body and a three - body part .",
    "for the two - body interaction , we have taken the potential developed by aziz _",
    "@xcite ( the so - called hfd - b3-fci1 potential ) .",
    "for the three - body part we have employed a bruch - mcgee - type potential @xcite , which includes the exchange three - body interaction and a triple - dipole axilrod - teller interaction . for most of the simulations presented below , the parameters employed for the three - body terms were those given by loubeyre @xcite , but with the parameter @xmath10 in the attractive exchange interaction rescaled by a factor 2/3 ( as suggested in ref .",

    ", the partition function is evaluated through a discretization of the density matrix along cyclic paths , composed of a finite number @xmath12 ( trotter number ) of `` imaginary - time '' steps @xcite . in the numerical simulations ,",
    "this discretization gives rise to the appearance of @xmath12 replicas for each quantum particle .",
    "thus , the practical implementation of this method relies on an isomorphism between the quantum system and a classical one , obtained by replacing each quantum particle by a cyclic chain of @xmath12 classical particles , connected by harmonic springs with a temperature - dependent constant .",

    "such a simplification is not possible here , since we consider explicitly three - body terms in the simulations .",
    "quantum exchange effects between atomic nuclei were not considered , as they are negligible for solid helium at the pressures and temperatures studied here .",
    "( this should be valid as long as there are no vacancies and @xmath13 is greater than the exchange frequency @xmath14 k @xcite . ) the dynamic effect of the interactions between nearest and next - nearest neighbours is explicitly considered .",
    "the effect of interactions beyond next - nearest neighbours is taken into account by a static - lattice approximation @xcite , which was employed earlier in pimc simulations of rare - gas solids @xcite .",
    "we have checked that including dynamical correlations between more distant atom shells does not change the results presented below . for the energy we have used the `` crude '' estimator , as defined in refs .",

    "sampling of the configuration space has been carried out by the metropolis method at pressures @xmath15 52 gpa , and temperatures between 25 k and the melting temperature of the solid at each considered pressure",
    ". a simulation run proceeds via successive monte carlo steps . in each step , the replica coordinates are updated according to three different kinds of sampling schemes : ( 1 ) sequential trial moves of the individual replica coordinates ; ( 2 ) trial moves of the center of gravity of the cyclic paths , keeping unaltered the shape of each path , and ( 3 ) trial changes on the logarithm of the volume of the simulation cell .",
    "for given temperature and pressure , a typical run consisted of @xmath16 monte carlo steps for system equilibration , followed by @xmath17 steps for the calculation of ensemble average properties .",

    "the value of @xmath12 required to obtain convergence of the results depends on the debye temperature @xmath7 of the considered solid ( higher @xmath7 needs larger @xmath12 ) . since vibrational frequencies ( and the associated debye temperature ) increase as the applied pressure is raised",

    "this important difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 reflects the large anharmonicity of lattice vibrations in this solid . for comparison , we mention that these energies differ by about 20% and 7% for solid neon and argon , respectively @xcite .",

    "this method allows us to separate the kinetic and potential contributions to the vibrational energy of a given solid , and quantify the anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations , which together with zero - point motion give rise to isotopic effects .",
    "pimc simulations yield in principle `` exact '' values for measurable properties of many - body quantum problems , with an accuracy limited by the imaginary - time step ( trotter number ) and the statistical error of the monte carlo sampling .",
    "thus , the effectve interatomic potential employed here gives a good description of structural and thermodynamic properties of solid helium up to pressures on the order of those presently achieved in experiments .",
    "in particular , the equation of state @xmath22-@xmath32 is well described by this potential in the pressure range considered here ( @xmath44 gpa ) , even though it is partially an empirical potential , in the sense that the attractive three - body part was rescaled _ ad hoc _ from the fit to _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "explicit consideration of three - body terms in pimc simulations makes the computation times much longer , in comparison with simulations including only two - body terms .",
    "but this has allowed us to check the validity limit of some approximations made earlier in this kind of calculations , such as including the effect of three - body terms in a perturbative way ( from configurations obtained in pimc simulations ) @xcite . as a result",
    ", this approximation yields at @xmath45 gpa an eos indistinguishable within error bars from that obtained here . at higher pressures , however , it predicts volumes larger than those found in the present work ( and in experiment ) .    due to the large anharmonicity of lattice vibrations in solid helium , the isotopic effect on the crystal volume is important . at low temperatures , the dependence of the crystal volume on isotopic mass",
    "is related to the zero - point lattice expansion .",

    "this ratio is clearly higher for solid helium at low @xmath22 , as shown in fig . 5 : @xmath47 1.4 for fcc @xmath1he at 25 k.",
    "it has been recently suggested that pressure causes a decrease in anharmonicity @xcite , in line with earlier observations that the accuracy of quasiharmonic approximations increases as pressure rises and the density of the material increases @xcite .",
    "thus , such approximations become exact in the high - density limit @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the ratio of the vibrational energy to the whole internal energy of the crystal decreases for increasing pressure , in spite of the increase in zero - point energy caused by the rise in vibrational frequencies .",
    "it has been also argued that at high pressures , thermodynamic properties of solids can be well described by classical calculations , i.e. , dealing with the atoms as classical oscillators in a given potential @xcite .",
    "this means that , at a given temperature , such a classical approach becomes more and more accurate as pressure is raised .",
    "the origin of this is similar to that described above for the success of quasiharmonic approaches . since in this respect",
    "the lattice vibrations become less relevant as pressure rises , and eventually give a negligible contribution to the free energy of the solid , their description by a classical or a quantum model becomes unimportant for solids in the limit of very large pressures .",
    "in summary , we have carried out pimc simulations of solid helium in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble . in general , our results support the assumptions made in earlier calculations , where three - body terms were included in a perturbative way .",
    "in particular , the equation of state obtained here coincides at @xmath48 gpa with that found in calculations employing the @xmath6 ensemble with that assumption . at high pressures , however , data yielded by the present pimc simulations differ from those obtained earlier , using similar interatomic potentials",
    ". the kind of effective interatomic potentials employed here , including two- and three - body terms will probably give a poor description of solid helium at very high pressures ( @xmath49 60 gpa ) , but seems appropriate for the pressure range in which experimental data are available at present ."
