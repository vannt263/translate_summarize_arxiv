    "when introducing his paradigm , maxwell had in mind greek daimones ( damones ) , i.e. powerful entities bridging the human and the divine .",
    "we shall thus formulate our approach in the language of a general game involving two daemons , aletheia ( alhjeia ) and bia ( ba ) , each attempting at extracting work from a two - qubit system .",
    "they share an ensemble of identically prepared pairs of qubits , each pair being prepared in a bipartite state @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , they agree on the choice of two sets of measurement operators ( one per daemon ) , that densely cover a great circle on the bloch sphere of a single qubit . for half of the ensemble",
    ", aletheia should choose from the set @xmath2 the projection operator to use in order to measure her qubit .",
    "in our notation , @xmath3 corresponds to the @xmath4 axes . for the remaining half of the ensemble , bia shall pick her measurement operator from the set @xmath5 . in these sets ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the angular position , over a great circle of their respective single - qubit bloch sphere , of the measurements performed by the daemons . in a given run of the game , aletheia measures operator @xmath8 and",
    "communicates the corresponding outcome @xmath9 to bia , allowing to reduce the entropy associated to her measurement result from the value @xmath10 to the conditional value @xmath11",
    "having in mind szilard s version of a maxwell s daemon - inspired scenario , it is straightforward to see that the amount of work that can be extracted from a system about which we only have partial information is proportional to @xmath12 . here @xmath13 is the shannon entropy associated with the binary variable @xmath14 that embodies the degree of freedom that was measured to gather information on the system .",
    "consequently , the work bia can extract following aletheia s measurement and the communication of her result is @xmath15 .",
    "an analogous reasoning can be carried out when exchanging the role of the daemons , concluding that , for a given setting , we find that the extractable work resulting from one run of the game is @xmath16\\\\ & = 1-h(a_\\theta , b_{\\theta'})+\\frac12[h(a_\\theta)+h(b_{\\theta ' } ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the joint entropy of variables @xmath9 and @xmath18 . with the choices made above ,",
    "@xmath19 is measured in bits . for a sufficiently dense covering of the great circle , and for @xmath20 ,",
    "the average extractable work achieved through the game , maximised over all the possible great circles , is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the azimuthal angle for the great circles being considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that any separable state @xmath1 is such that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the maximum average work evaluated for any pure factored state .",
    "such upper bound represents the maximum work extractable , through such a game , from classically correlated states .",
    "therefore , any surplus of extractable work above @xmath24 arises in virtue of entanglement shared by the daemons .",
    "eq .   can then be used as a thermodynamically rooted entropic witness for inseparability .",
    "while entropic inequalities have been previously introduced and tested  @xcite , these are rooted in purely informational considerations , while here we have a direct connection with thermodynamics .",
    "barium - borate ( bbo ) crystal pumped with 100 mw of laser at 355 nm , in conjunction with a spherical mirror ( m ) , and delivers approximately 200 coincidences / s through 5 nm ( fwhm ) interference filters ( if ) .",
    "details on the source can be found in ref .",
    "we encode the logical states of each qubit in the horizontal and vertical polarization states @xmath25 and @xmath26 of each photon . using quantum state tomography , we estimate a fidelity @xmath27 of the entangled resource with the maximally entangled state @xmath28 . the corresponding value of tangle is @xmath29 .",
    "the relative weight ( @xmath30 ) of the two polarization contributions in such state can be tuned by the quarter waveplate ( @xmath31 ) in the source .",
    "one of the photons passes through a depolarizing channel , consisting of two liquid crystals ( lcs ) and the associated control electronics , which selects the value of @xmath32 .",
    "finally , polarization measurements are performed at a polarisation - analysis module consisting of a qwp , a half waveplate ( hwp ) , a polarising beam splitter ( pbs ) , and an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) per mode .",
    "we also show the single - mode fibers ( smf ) used to convey the photonics signal to the polarization analysis module .",

    "we employ the thermodynamic separability criterion in eq .   for the characterisation of photonic entanglement .",
    "polarization - entangled pairs of qubits , ideally prepared in the state @xmath38 , are produced by using the double - pass source in  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : exp_setup ] ) . here , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) indicates a photon in the horizontal ( vertical ) polarization state .",
    "further , we explore how the thermodynamic bound evolves through a depolarising channel degrading the initial state to the mixture @xmath39 here , the parameter @xmath40 quantifies the strength of the channel .",
    "this has been implemented by using two liquid crystals , with their axes at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , onto the path of one photon .",
    "the two crystals are tuned in such a way that they perform a rapid succession of pauli operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , thus generating white noise on the state  @xcite .    *",
    "( a ) *     in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : exp_setup ] , we show typical experimental curves for the work @xmath33 calculated according to eq .",
    ", as we inspect the set of operator pairs used by aletheia and bia , labelled by the angle @xmath6 on the great circle of the bloch sphere corresponding to the linear polarizations ( i.e. the equator of the single - qubit bloch sphere ) .",
    "this is the set of directions allowing for optimal work extraction .",
    "the observed oscillations are due to the polarization unbalance , while the average level is affected by the purity of the state . for each choice of @xmath6 ,",
    "we have calculated the shannon entropy associated to single - particle operators , as well as the joint entropy associated to the joint operator .",
    "we have verified by numerical simulations that our covering with 19 different directions is sufficiently dense for the continuous approximation to hold .",
    "in addition , we have fully characterised our states with quantum state tomography , from which the maximal value of the bell operator @xmath46 has been extracted for a comparison with a standard entanglement witness .    in order to perform the average over the projections performed by the daemons , we removed the quarter waveplates ( qwps ) from the polarization analysis - module shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup ] , and used the half waveplates ( hwps ) to rotate the state along the correct big circle .",
    "the effect of the polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) is that of performing the projection @xmath47 .",
    "as we used just two avalanche photo - diodes ( apds ) after the pbss , we had to implement four different types of measurements for each of the 19 choices of angular direction on the equator of the single - qubit bloch sphere .",
    "in particular , we had to consider the four sets of directions @xmath48 , where the first ( second ) angular direction is for aletheia s ( bia s ) measurements choice .",
    "the corresponding detected coincidences at the apds are labelled as @xmath49 .",
    "a full circulation of the bloch - sphere equator is then achieved by rotating the hwps from @xmath50 to @xmath51 in 19 steps .",
    "this implies that a total of 76 measurements were needed in order to acquire the necessary information to perform the evaluation of the work extraction performance . upon suitable normalization of the detected coincidence counts",
    ", we have the following set of probabilities @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "these are instrumental to the evaluation of the shannon entropies needed to calculate @xmath33 and , in turn , @xmath54 .    *",
    "( a ) *    we measured the extractable thermodynamic work for several sets of parameters @xmath55 and @xmath32 in the resource state , which were estimated by reconstructing the density matrix of the experimentally engineered state @xmath56 via complete quantum state tomography for each position of the qwp in the source ( setting @xmath55 ) and every configuration of the lcs ( fixing @xmath32 ) .",
    "extractable work has been calculated by measuring shannon entropy spanned over the whole big circle of the bloch sphere .",
    "example of measured coincidence counts are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , achieved in 30s of measurement .    in order to highlight the inherently different nature of the test implemented here and a standard bell test ,",

    "local realistic theories bound such function as @xmath70 , while quantum mechanically @xmath71 . using eq .  , we find @xmath72[\\cos(2\\alpha)+\\sin(2\\alpha)],\\ ] ] which we have used to estimate the value of the bell function using the experimental density matrix @xmath56 for each set value of @xmath32 and @xmath55 .",
    "the results of our experiment are summarised in fig .",
    "2 , where we show the measured extractable work and the bell function for two resource states with different values of @xmath55 . the comparison with bell s",
    "test reveals how both quantities capture the degradation resulting from the depolarisation channel , and that they are similarly robust against the bias between the @xmath73 and @xmath74 contributions .",
    "a complete analysis shows that the relation between the thermodynamic criterion and bell s inequalities is not trivial .",
    "in fact , we were able to find values of @xmath32 and @xmath55 for which it is possible to violate just one of the two criteria , and vice versa .",
    "we have considered an experimental state with large bias ( @xmath75 ) and purity ( @xmath76 ) that offers no violation of the local realistic bound ( @xmath77 ) . however , the corresponding extractable work is @xmath78 , which exceeds the separability threshold @xmath79 by 2 standard deviations .",
    "this implies that the use of entanglement for powering a thermal machine is qualitatively different from that necessary for communication tasks , such as measurement - independent key distribution .",
    "[ fig:3d_graphs ] shows a comprehensive comparison between the theoretical predictions gathered by using eq .   and the experimental data , revealing the great agreement between the latter and the former throughout the whole range of parameters assessed in our experimental investigation .    [ tab : table1 ]    .table of the experimental data .",
    "here @xmath32 is the strength of the channel , while @xmath55 determines the unbalance between the @xmath80 and @xmath81 components in the ideal resource state @xmath82 .",
    "both parameters have been estimated by performing state tomography of the experimental resource @xmath56 ; @xmath54 is the extractable work from the system .",
    "its standard deviation @xmath83 has been obtained by considering poissonian statistic on the coincidence counts .",
    "@xmath46 is the bell function , while @xmath84 provides the value of tangle  @xcite , which quantifies the degree of entanglement within the state of the system .",
    "both these parameters ( and associated uncertainties ) have been estimated using state tomography .",
    "values of @xmath54 and @xmath46 reported in bold violate the separability and local realistic bound , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in all cases , there is a significant violation of the separability bound .",
    "moreover , the symmetry among the results that we have achieved capture unambiguously the ghz - cluster character of the experimental resource . in order to show this feature more clearly",
    ", we have repeated the experiment when complete decoherence is introduced in one of the qubits of the system , in an attempt to render our resource state bi - separable and wash out its genuine tripartite entanglement . when full decoherence is introduced in the path - encoded qubit by inserting a thick glass plate on one of the paths , allowing to disrupt coherence between the two modes ( independent of polarization ) ,",
    "we get @xmath85 , which is very close to the corresponding value in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "however , decoherence lessens the values of the other two witnesses , to values that are very close to the separability threshold in eq .",
    ", demonstrating the disappearance of tripartite entanglement .",
    "a similar analysis has been conducted using the experimental @xmath0-type resource , whose corresponding experimental results are reported in table  [ tab : table3 ] .",
    "as done for the ghz - cluster state , we have assessed both the case of a close - to - ideal resource and that of a strongly decohered one close to the separability threshold .",
    "the diversity ( in terms of entanglement - sharing structure ) of such resources is fully captured by the extractable work .",
    "a comparison with non - locality - based criteria similar to the one reported for the study of bipartite entanglement can be made in this tripartite context . here , rather than concentrating on two - qubit correlations",
    ", we shall investigate their genuinely multipartite nature , whose characterisation is clearly a much more demanding problem to tackle .",
    "a powerful tool in this respect is embodied by genuinely tripartite versions of a bell inequality , such as the inequality proposed by svetlichny  @xcite , whose violation witnesses the occurrence of multipartite non - local correlations . such inequality has been successfully experimentally violated using a photonic ghz state  @xcite and used to ascertain the properties of the ground state of a many - body system in a photonics quantum simulator  @xcite .    in the svetlichny game ,",
    "the daemons locally rotate their respective qubit by an angle @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) through the operator @xmath88 and project it over the basis of @xmath89 . if state @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) is found , they attach a dicothomic variable the value @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this allows them to build the the statistical correlation function for local spin measurements @xmath94 and , in turn , construct the mermin - ardehali - belisnskii - klyshko function  @xcite @xmath95 the svetlichny function is thus @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the same as @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "any biseparable state satisfies the inequality @xmath100 .",
    "tripartite entangles states violate the inequality up to the maximum value of @xmath101 , which is obtained using ghz - like states .",
    "in fact , state @xmath102 allows to achieve such a maximum violation for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we have used the experimental quantum state tomographies of the ghz - cluster and @xmath0 resource states to evaluate the svetlichny function . after a global optimisation over all the angles involved , we have found @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this shows that the experimental ghz - cluster state is consistently found to be entangled in a genuinely tripartite sense by both the extractable work - based criterion and the svetlichny one . on the other hand",
    ", the non locality - based entanglement criterion fails to detect the tripartite entangled nature of the experimental @xmath0 resource , which is instead well captured by the sensitivity exhibited by the extractable work .",
    "we have demonstrated experimentally a fundamental result of information thermodynamics , showing that entangled working media are able to provide a significant surplus in the amount of work that can be extracted through a communication assisted game fundamentally based on maxwell s daemon .",
    "such protocols , in turn , represent viable tests for the inseparability of a given state resource that , as demonstrated in our experimental endeavors , are both practical and fundamentally interesting in light of their distinct nature from , say , non - locality based entanglement witnesses .",
    "this work has significant implications for both technological and conceptual aspects .",
    "concerning the technological advances that it entails , we contribute to the well sought - after and ongoing efforts aimed at setting up a photonics - based platform for information thermodynamics .",
    "such platform has the capability of preparing , controlling and measuring , with high fidelity and a reduced experimental complexity , states of a multipartite working medium .",
    "furthermore , general evolutions can be easily implemented or simulated , thus paving the way to the implementation of a fully fledged experimental assessment of non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the latter has so far been limited to either classical systems or nuclear magnetic resonance setups , where any quantum feature is weakened by the typically strong environmental actions . as for the fundamental aspects ,",
    "we have highlighted how non - classical correlations within the working medium should be interpreted as a resource for the performance of thermodynamic processes , not differently from quantities with a counterpart in classical thermodynamics .",
    "this points to an interesting direction for understanding the emergence of ordinary world from its quantum microscopic constituents .",

    "<S> both discrete and continuous - time heat engine exhibit non - classical signatures enabling enhanced power outputs with respect to the relevant classical ( i.e. stochastic ) version of such machines  @xcite .    on the other hand , perfectly reversible work extraction from an ensemble of non - interacting quantum information carriers appears to be possible without the need for creating any entanglement  @xcite . while entangling quantum operations allow for the retrieval of the same amount of work as in the classical case with more economic protocols , such advantage appear to fade away in the case of a large number of systems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> within such an interesting quest for the origin of  quantumness \" in quantum thermodynamics , a core achievement is given by the design of protocols allowing for an enhanced work extraction from a heat bath when using an entangled working medium rather than a separable one  @xcite . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , such a result embodies a thermodynamics - inspired witness of the presence of ( multipartite ) entanglement in the working medium , thus contributing explicitly to the formulation of thermodynamic separability criteria . </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of such approaches to inseparability in the case of physical working media prepared in quantum laboratories has not yet been addressed due to the scarcity of experiments addressing the quantum thermodynamic framework , of which we only have a handful to date  @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we bridge this gap by investigating experimentally the quantum enhanced work extraction achieved using non - ideal entangled two- and three - qubit quantum working media . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the attainability of an experimental bound on the maximal extractable work that signals the presence of non - classical correlations . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment provides evidence that non - classical correlations empowering work extraction bear differences to those responsible for the violation of bell - type inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that , through so far unexplored theoretical tools , our results pioneer novel experimental methods towards the understanding of how non - classical correlations can effect the efficiency of quantum thermodynamic processes , at equal footing with thermodynamic potentials . </S>",
    "<S> this is a topical problem of both foundational and pragmatic relevance for the development of future engines operating at the nanoscale and in the fully quantum regime . </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this work is organised as follows : in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 2 ] we illustrate both the theoretical scheme and the experimental implementation for entanglement - enhanced work extraction from a two - qubit photonics working medium . sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 3 ] addresses the extension to the first non - trivial multipartite scenario in this context , namely a three - photon resource prepared in either a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , or a @xmath0 one . finally , in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ final ] , while drawing the salient conclusions of our investigation , we present the possible extensions of our study to other information theoretical investigations linked to the relation between ( quantum ) information and thermodynamics . </S>"
