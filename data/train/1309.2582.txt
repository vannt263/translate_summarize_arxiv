    "the problem of deriving an analytic ( or semi - analytic ) expression for the the force between quarks in an ab - initio way continues to be the subject of investigation ( see , for example , the book by j. greensite @xcite and the quark confinement and hadron spectrum conferences and corresponding proceedings http://www.confx.de/index.html ) .",
    "the form of the potential between a fixed quark and antiquark , separated by a distance @xmath0 has been calculated in lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the shape of the potential is found to resemble the phenomenological so - called cornell potential @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to determine the form of the potential in heavy quarkonium , by using the variational method , in a reformulated hamiltonian formalism of qcd .",
    "such an approach has been found to be useful for the study of few - body bound states in qft , including qed @xcite as well as model scalar theories with non - linear mediating fields @xcite .",
    "the qcd lagrangian density ( units : @xmath2 ) , suppressing the spinor and flavour indices , is  @xcite @xmath3 where the shorthand definitions are @xmath4 the quark field @xmath5 is a dirac spinor where the index @xmath6 is a colour index .",

    "the term containing @xmath16 is known as the gauge fixing term .",
    "physical observables do not , in principle , depend on the value of @xmath16 .",
    "however , the canonical quantization of the gauge field is problematic in its absence since the conjugate momentum is undefined , i.e. @xmath17 if @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to express the lagrangian density ( [ eq : lqcd1 ] ) in the following form @xmath19 where @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 means equivalence , modulo an irrelevant total derivative ( surface ) term , and @xmath24    the equation of motion for the gauge field @xmath25 that follows from ( [ eq : lqcd2 ] ) is @xmath26 where the `` source '' @xmath27 of this inhomogeneous equation is @xmath28 note that in the qed case ( u(1 ) , cf .",
    "@xcite ) the cubic ( [ eq : l3a ] ) and quartic ( [ eq : l4a ] ) terms do not arise , and the source term would contain the fermion fields only , that is , just the first term of equation ( [ eq : source ] ) .    equation ( [ eq : em_a ] ) can be written in integral from : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the green function of the homogeneous equation , that is @xmath31 in practice , one must specify a gauge",

    "this is easily achieved , since the  source \" @xmath37 does not contain the mediating photon field .",
    "however , for qcd the  source \" term ( [ eq : source ] ) does contains the gauge fields @xmath25 so it is not possible to solve ( [ eq : em_a ] ) to express the gluon fields in terms of the quark fields explicitly .",
    "hence we must resort to approximations ; an obvious approach is iteration .    in lowest iterative order , which is what we shall use",
    ", the `` source '' term is truncated to @xmath38 using this lowest - order truncation in the terms of the lagrangian density ( [ eq : lqcd3 ] ) leads to @xmath39 this reformulated lagrangian density contains only quark fields ; the interactions involving the mediating gluon field are represented by the gluon propagators .",
    "note that @xmath40 contains terms corresponding to one gluon ( @xmath41 ) , three gluon ( @xmath42 ) and four gluon ( @xmath43 ) interactions .",
    "summation of the colour indices is implied , _",

    "in the quantized theory the fields are operators that satisfy anti - commutation rules that are very similar to those of qed , but with the inclusion of colour indices ( and , flavour indices if needed ) .",
    "to specify our notation , we quote the anti - commutation relations for given flavour : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are quark annihilation and creation operators , respectively , with spin and colour indices @xmath50 and @xmath51 . similarly , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the corresponding anti - quark operators .    in terms of these operators , after integrating out the spatial coordinates and normal - ordering the ladder operators to remove the infinite vacuum energy , one obtains the hamiltonian operator @xmath54 where the free hamiltonian is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being the mass of the quark ( of given flavour ) . evidently , this is like the expression for qed , except for the extra sum over the colour index .",

    "the colour index of a quark ( anti - quark ) transforms in the fundamental ( conjugate ) representation of @xmath13 . to find the colour index factors @xmath73 and @xmath74 one must consider group products of @xmath13 representations .",
    "the dimensions of the group products of @xmath13 representation can be determined using the young tableaux method @xcite .",
    "appendix b of reference @xcite has some details of the derivation of the group products .",
    "the two required decompositions are @xmath81 it is known experimentally that the physically allowed representations are colourless ( i.e. zero in each of the eight colour charges ; see below ) corresponding to the one dimensional representations .",
    "the singlet in equation ( [ eq : one_sing ] ) provides the colour  wavefunction \" for the single - pair component ( [ eq : qcdtrial2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the two singlets in ( [ eq : two_sing ] ) provide the colour index  function \" for the two - pair component ( [ eq : qcdtrial4 ] ) .",
    "this index  wavefunction \" is , again , comprised of delta symbols and , in this case , has to be equally weighted between the two singlets .",
    "the properly normalized index functions are @xmath82 it is easily verified that the trial state ( [ eq : qcdtrial24 ] ) , with the colour index functions given by ( [ eq : lambdaijkl ] ) , is an eigenstate of the total colour charge operator @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) with eigenvalue @xmath85 .",
    "the colour charge operator is @xmath86    in order to extract the quark - antiquark potential we must derive the variational equations that follow from the variational principle @xmath87 .",
    "the details of the evaluation of the matrix element @xmath88 are given in appendix b of reference @xcite .",
    "the variation of the matrix element with respect to both coefficient functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 leads to the coupled equations that describe bound states of a meson : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and the colour indices have been summed over and the resulting colour factors included in the kernels ( relativistic momentum - space potentials ) @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the constant @xmath95 is the ratio that specifies the relative contributions of each fock - space component .",
    "the kernel @xmath96 turns out to be zero due to the colour summation as is explained in reference @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqrelqcd4 ] ) are coupled relativistic integral equations for the wavefunctions @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are difficult to solve , even approximately .",
    "the function @xmath75 describes a quark - antiquark pair of mass @xmath97 , while @xmath76 describes a two quark - antiquark - pair state with quark flavours of mass @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively . these equations are , in principle , capable of describing the process of string breaking in qcd , _",
    "i.e. _ the transition from a single meson state @xmath99 to a two meson state @xmath100 .",
    "the relativistic kinematics are described fully and without approximations .",
    "however , the dynamics are described approximately by the kernels @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 because of the approximate nature of the trial state ( [ eq : qcdtrial24 ] ) and the first - order iterative approximation in the reformulation procedure .",
    "note that if the two - pair component , @xmath106 of the trial state ( [ eq : qcdtrial24 ] ) , were not included , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath107 in equation ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) , the only interaction kernel ( relativistic momentum - space potential ) that would remain is @xmath108 .",
    "it corresponds to one - gluon exchange , that is the attractive coulombic potential in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "our purpose in this work is to study the quark - antiquark potential inherent in the coupled equations ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqrelqcd4 ] ) . for this purpose",
    "it is sufficient to consider equation ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) only .",
    "consequently , we do not need to concern ourselves with the kernels @xmath103 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the colour indices have been summed in the kernels @xmath101 and @xmath109 of eqn ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) and the results appear as multiplicative factors in front . in the kernel @xmath110 of eqn ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) , the colour factor is expressed by the contraction @xmath111 of the structure constants .",
    "note that the spin and momentum dependences are still coupled in these relativistic equations whereas the colour dependence is separable and calculated fully .",
    "the relativistic kernels pertaining to equation ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) for the function @xmath75 are , explicitly , @xmath112 @xmath113",
    "in the non - relativistic limit , the spin and momentum dependences of the wavefunctions decouple .",
    "that is , the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be written as the products @xmath114 the simplest spin configuration to consider is the singlet where the spin eigenvalues are @xmath115 .",
    "the corresponding properly normalized spin index functions are @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the totally - antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the non - relativistic equation for the function @xmath118 in the spin singlet configuration can be obtained by multiplying the non - relativistic reduction of equation ( [ eq : eqrelqcd2 ] ) by @xmath119 , of equation ( [ eq : spinxi ] ) , and summing over all the spin indices .",
    "in addition , the functions @xmath118 and @xmath120 are expressed in the centre of mass frame , so that the total energy corresponds to the rest mass of the system : @xmath121 consequently , one can integrate out one momentum dependence and thus reduce the number of independent momentum variables in the equations .",
    "this leads to altered interaction kernels which exhibit a degree of skewness ( loss of symmetry ) in their dependence on the momentum variables .",
    "the non - relativistic equation for the quark - antiquark system in the singlet configuration of spin and in the centre of mass frame is @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the non - relativistic energy and all spin indices have been summed .",
    "after extensive calculations , the kernels @xmath124 and @xmath125 , to order @xmath126 , are found to be : @xmath127 the kernel @xmath128 has been left out since its leading contribution is of order @xmath129 .",
    "the appearance of the factor @xmath51 in @xmath125 may seem to be troublesome since the inter - particle potential can not be imaginary .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath35 is not restricted to be real and one can make a choice such that it is purely imaginary to enforce the overall term to be real .",
    "even so , there still remains the choice of the phase which leaves the sign in front undetermined .",
    "we fourier transform equation ( [ eq : eqforsmallf ] ) to coordinates space by multiplying it by @xmath130 and integrating over @xmath131 .",
    "such an operation does not lead to an equation where the wavefunction and inter - particle potential stand as separate factors in all terms . in the terms where the decoupling does not occur , one is forced to multiply and divide by @xmath132 , the fourier transform of @xmath133 . subsequently , an ansatz for @xmath134 must be provided . for the ground state",
    "we make the choice @xmath135 which is the normalized wavefunction for the ground state of hydrogen ( or positronium ) , with @xmath68 being the characteristic size .    similarly , for the function @xmath136 , in equation ( [ eqg ] ) , we choose the following variational ansatz ( cf .",
    "reference @xcite ) : @xmath137 where the factors in front are included for convenience and the normalization of this wavefunction is absorbed into the definition of @xmath35 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : smallg ] ) reflects , as in equation ( [ eq : hydrogen ] ) , a factorized hydrogen - like dependence for each three - momentum variable and is appropriate for the ground state since it contains no angular dependence .      where @xmath141 is the dimensionless coupling constant of the strong interaction .",
    "the last term in the second line of equation ( [ eq : psiv1 ] ) has been multiplied and divided by @xmath142 , and ( [ eq : hydrogen ] ) used to approximate @xmath134 in coordinate and momentum spaces .",
    "the contribution to the potential energy from the last term is non - local and the procedure of multiplying and dividing by @xmath134 provides a local representation for it .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : psiv1 ] ) that @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 is the coulombic",
    " one - gluon exchange \" term , while the remaining terms are the lowest - order relativistic corrections to it . with a little effort",
    ", one can reduce the integral in the last line of ( [ eq : psiv1 ] ) to a double quadrature : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a dimensionless quark - antiquark separation variable , @xmath148 is the analogous dimensionless scale parameter and the remaining integrals are expressed in terms of dimensionless momentum variables .    the @xmath149 contribution to the inter - particle potential , which comes from the @xmath106 component of the trail state ( [ eq : qcdtrial24 ] ) , is given by @xmath150 where , again , it has been multiplied and divided by @xmath134 and the anstze ( [ eq : hydrogen ] ) and ( [ eq : smallg ] ) have been used .",
    "from this , it follows that the @xmath149 contribution to the potential is @xmath151 where the notation @xmath152 has been introduced and , as before , the necessary substitutions have been made to make the integration variables dimensionless .",
    "note that the requirement that @xmath153 be real means that @xmath154 must be real , either positive or negative .",
    "the proper choice of sign will be discussed below .",
    "since we are considering the non - relativistic approximation , the quark flavour @xmath155 might be either the charm with the mass @xmath156 or the bottom quark with the mass @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , to model a realistic string breaking effect , the lighter quark flavour could be the up or the down quark with approximately identical but ill - defined masses in the neighbourhood of @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "hence , a value of @xmath159 is a reasonable estimate of the light - to - heavy quark mass ratio @xmath160 .",
    "with @xmath159 the first term in equation ( [ eq : v2 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "the value of the coupling constant @xmath161 , obtained from expression @xmath162 $ ] ( where @xmath163 is the value of @xmath10 at @xmath164 ) , should correspond to the bound state energy of , say , a bottom quark - antiquark system in the singlet spin configuration of mass @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "this is the qcd bound state whose potential will be investigated . as input one can use the experimentally measured value @xmath166 where @xmath167  @xcite . upon substitution ,",
    "one obtains @xmath168 , which is the value that we shall use .",
    "note that for the bottom quark - antiquark system , one unit of distance in bohr radius corresponds approximately to @xmath169 .",
    "note also that @xmath170 is of order @xmath171 .",
    "equation @xmath172 , as it stands , contains two , yet undetermined , variational parameters @xmath155 and @xmath35 ( or @xmath173 ) .",
    "the numerical values of these parameters should be obtained from a variational calculation of the matrix element @xmath174 .",
    "such a calculation requires great effort which is not undertaken in this work . instead , the approach shall be to multiply equation @xmath175 by @xmath176 and integrate over the variable @xmath131 : @xmath177 carrying out the indicated integrals ( details are given in @xcite , appendix b. section 6.5 ) we obtain the following expression for the total non - relativistic energy @xmath178 of a meson in the singlet spin configuration in terms of the variational parameters @xmath155 and @xmath35 : @xmath179 where , the constant @xmath180 emerges from the calculation of the first term on the left hand side of equation @xmath181 .",
    "the constant @xmath182 : @xmath183 is a multidimensional integral expression which one has to solve numerically using , in practice , the monte carlo method .    unfortunately , it turns out that monte carlo integration of equation ( [ eq : c2 ] ) does not produce reliable results .",
    "the troublesome pieces of the integrand are the triple scalar vector products in the numerator . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", one can place an upper bound on the integral by considering upper bounds on the scalar vector products : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the angle between the vectors @xmath186 and @xmath187 and @xmath188 is the angle between the vectors @xmath189 and @xmath190 . when all scalar vector products are replaced by their upper bound estimates , equation ( [ eq : c2 ] ) can be reduced to a triple quadrature in the radial coordinates of the momentum variables : @xmath191 where only the leading terms in the parameter @xmath16 have been kept . to obtain this result ,",
    "angular integrations resembling those in the calculation of the constant @xmath192 have been employed .",
    "the parameter @xmath193 is a regulator which has been inserted to ensure that a numerical evaluation of this triple quadrature converges .",
    "one must perform many numerical integrations where the value of @xmath193 is reduced in each successive trial . if the integral converges then its numerical evaluation should approach a constant value as @xmath193 tends zero . in this case , the triple quadrature is found to converge to the value @xmath194    the observed energy @xmath195 of the bottom quark - antiquark state being considered , expressed in units of @xmath196 , is 1.233 .",
    "accordingly , one can solve the equation ( [ eq : energya ] ) to determine the values of @xmath155 and @xmath35 which could produce such an energy .",
    "doing so , one finds that only the plus sign in equation ( [ eq : energya ] ) ( correspondingly the negative sign in equation ( [ eq : v2 ] ) ) is realizable for this energy .",
    "figure ( [ fig : plotra ] ) shows a plot of the allowed values of the parameters @xmath155 and @xmath173 .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath155 would be @xmath197 if the inter - quark potential were purely coulombic and the wave - function would be hydrogenic .",
    "the effect of the confining contribution is to change the shape of the wave function in the large-@xmath0 domain in which the wave function is rapidly decreasing to zero .",
    "thus , the presence of the confining contribution in the potential would not change the value of @xmath155 substantially , so that the estimate @xmath197 is not unreasonable .",
    "having estimated the values of the input parameters , we return to the expression for @xmath149 , equation ( [ eq : v2 ] ) .",
    "this multidimensional expression can be reduced to the following triple quadrature : @xmath198 where similar steps have been taken as those in the calculation of the constant @xmath182 .",
    "again , the parameter @xmath193 is a regulator which is , ultimately , to be taken to zero .",
    "the sign in equation ( [ eq : v2a ] ) , which leads to physically meaningful results is the negative one .    with the negative sign ( - ) in equation ( [ eq : v2a ] )",
    ", the inter - quark potential @xmath199 exhibits a confining character at larger separation distances , whereas the opposite sign ( + ) yields a potential which does not support stable bound states .",
    "this is evident from the plots in figure ( [ fig : qqpot1 ] ) , where the inter - particle potential curves corresponding to both signs in equation ( [ eq : v2a ] ) are plotted .",
    "it is useful to examine the behaviour of the potential for somewhat different values of the parameters @xmath155 and @xmath35 . to this end ,",
    "figure [ fig : qqpot2 ] illustrates the quark - antiquark potential for the indicated values of the parameters @xmath155 and @xmath35 which are obtained from the curve in figure [ fig : plotra ] .",
    "the quark - antiquark potential is substantially altered from its coulombic behaviour by the @xmath59 term of the qcd hamiltonian ( [ eq : qcdhamreform ] ) .",
    "the apparent linear segment is characteristic of all three curves ( at least in the domain @xmath200 , beyond which the numerical results become unreliable ) .",
    "the higher values of @xmath155 seems to render the linear segment longer . beyond the separation distances shown on the graph ,",
    "the points become increasingly scattered .",
    "the likely cause of this scattering is due to the difficulty of evaluating accurately the product of the exponential factor @xmath201 and the numerical calculation of the triple quadrature in @xmath149 , equation ( [ eq : v2a ] ) .",
    "this scattering can be diminished by requiring greater numerical accuracy in the evaluation of the triple quadrature but , of course , at the expanse of computational time . in any case",
    ", the validity of the curves is questionable beyond the linear segment and this is likely due to the limited accuracy in evaluating the triple quadrature .",
    "it is of interest to extract the string tension @xmath202 ( i.e. the slope of the linear segment ) of the quark - antiquark potential and compare it with the value known from lattice gauge calculations . in greensite s book  @xcite , the value obtained from lqcd is quoted to be @xmath203 . in figure",
    "[ fig : qqpot2 ] , the approximate values of the slopes are @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 respectively .",
    "these derived values are in reasonable agreement with the lqcd calculations .",
    "thus , the present results are gratifying given the approximate estimation of the parameters @xmath155 and @xmath35 .",
    "also , it must be born in mind that the triple scalar vector products in the integrals ( [ eq : v2 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) are approximated by their upper bounds , cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq : tsvp ] ) .",
    "note that in the approach of this work , the effect of the non - abelian terms on the inter - particle interactions is to modify the shape of the potential but leave the coupling constant @xmath161 unchanged .",
    "this is quite different from the ( low - order ) perturbative s - matrix formalism where the coupling constant @xmath161 becomes energy dependent but the coulombic shape of the potential remains unchanged .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to see that the inclusion of a virtual quark - antiquark pair in the trial state ( [ eq : qcdtrial4 ] ) changes the potential between the heavy valence quark - antiquark pair from purely attractive coulombic one to one which exhibits linear confinement .",
