    "precision tests of the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix remain high on the agenda of flavor physics . they allow to pin down the standard model  ( sm ) description of cp - violation and may reveal physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) . on the experimental side , the two @xmath2-meson factories at slac and kek , after approximately a decade of their operation , have made a great impact on the origin of cp - violation in the quark sector of the sm . especially in @xmath3 physics ,",
    "the @xmath2-factory experiments babar and belle have concentrated on the production and decays of the @xmath4 resonances , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , yielding precise measurements of their decay products , the @xmath2- and the @xmath7-mesons .",
    "theoretically , inclusive decays of the @xmath2-mesons , such as the radiative and semileptonic decays , are under quantitative control , thanks to the use of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , allowing an expansion in the inverse @xmath3-quark mass , with perturbative qcd allowing to calculate corrections in @xmath8 to each order in @xmath9 .",
    "exclusive semileptonic and radiative decays require , on the other hand , a precise knowledge of the non - perturbative quantities - the decay form factors - to be analyzed precisely .",
    "however , also in such cases , the large energy released in the @xmath10 decays , where @xmath11 is a light meson and @xmath12 , allows to relate several of these form factors . the resulting large energy effective theory ( leet ) , which has been replaced by a more systematic effective theory ,",
    "the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) , has been put to good use in these decays , resulting in a number of theoretical predictions on different observables in various channels , which are found in global agreement with the experimental measurements ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the attention in flavor physics has so far mostly been focused on the meson sector .",
    "specific processes involving bottom baryons , such as rare decays involving flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions , are also potential sources of bsm physics .",
    "experiments at the lhc , in particular the lhc@xmath3 , are already analyzing the copiously produced @xmath3-baryons .",
    "as more luminosity is collected , the @xmath3-baryon sector will become a wider and quantitative field .",
    "theoretically , these decays are more involved , in particular the non - leptonic @xmath3-baryon decays , but the semileptonic and radiative @xmath3-baryon decays are tractable . as the starting point for the calculations of the transition form factors , a precise knowledge of the quark distributions inside the baryons is needed .",
    "the lcdas provide this input in the case of light quarks having high virtuality , which then become a crucial input to the calculations of the baryonic transitions in the light cone sum rule approach .",
    "baryonic transitions involving a heavy quark have been studied since the beginning of the 90s . however , the theoretical precision achieved so far is not comparable to the one attained for the corresponding mesonic transitions .",
    "so far , most of the heavy baryon distribution amplitudes discussed in the literature  @xcite are the ones which are motivated by various quark models , which are not manifestly consistent with the qcd constraints .",
    "hence , it is desirable to make theoretical inroads in this sector , guided by qcd .",
    "this effort will pay off , as the baryons have the advantage over the @xmath2-mesons of providing access to spin correlations in various baryon - to - baryon transitions .",
    "a full angular analysis of the semileptonic decays of some @xmath3-baryons , such as the decays of the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 , will provide a much more detailed view of the underlying dynamics . of special interest",
    "are the semileptonic heavy baryon decays , governed by heavy - to - light form factors . in this retrospect , apart from the theoretical analysis based on the heavy quark effective theory  @xcite , the simplification of baryonic form factors in the large recoil limit is exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an earlier discussion ) . in the framework of the soft - collinear effective theory ,",
    "it is demonstrated that the leading - power heavy - to - light baryonic form factors at large recoil obey the heavy quark and large energy symmetries  @xcite , and in particular the universal function ( soft form factor ) in @xmath15 is also calculated within the light - cone qcd sum rules in conjunction with the effective field theory  @xcite .",

    "in addition , simple models of the lcdas were suggested and their parameters were fixed based on estimates of the first few moments by the qcd sum rules method .",
    "this analysis can be extended to all the ground - state @xmath3-baryons with both the spin parities @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the basic steps and some of the results of such an analysis were presented in a conference proceedings  @xcite . in this paper , we provide the details of the calculations , in particular , concerning the @xmath22 @xmath3-baryons .",
