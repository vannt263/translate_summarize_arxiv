    "a central goal in quantum chromodynamics is to describe the structure and dynamics of hadrons at the amplitude level .",
    "the light - front fock expansion provides a physical description of hadrons as composites of quarks and gluons analogous to the @xmath6 momentum - space wavefunction description of nonrelativistic bound states of the schrdinger theory .",
    "the light - front wavefunctions @xmath7 are functions of the constituent light - cone fractions @xmath8 , relative transverse momenta @xmath9 , and spin projections @xmath10 they are relativistic and frame - independent , describing all particle number excitations @xmath11 of the hadrons .",
    "the light - front fock expansion follows from the quantization of qcd at fixed light - front time @xmath12 .",
    "the bound - state hadronic solutions @xmath13 are eigenstates of the light - front heisenberg equation @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of qcd is given by the eigenvalues @xmath15 .",
    "the projection of each hadronic eigensolution on the free fock basis : @xmath16 then defines the lf fock expansion in terms of the quark and transversely polarized gluon constituents in @xmath17 light - cone gauge .",
    "the expansion has only transversely polarized gluons . the freedom to choose the light - like quantization four - vector provides an explicitly covariant formulation of light - front quantization and can be used to determine the analytic structure of light - front wave functions and to define a kinematical definition of angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "the front form thus provides a consistent definition of relative orbital angular momentum and @xmath18 conservation : the total spin projection @xmath19 is conserved in each fock state .",
    "the cluster decomposition theorem  @xcite and the vanishing of the  anomalous gravitomagnetic moment \" @xmath20  @xcite are immediate properties of the lf fock wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "given the light - front wavefunctions @xmath21 , one can compute a large range of hadron observables .",
    "for example , the valence and sea quark and gluon distributions which are measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering are defined from the squares of the lfwfs summed over all fock states @xmath11 .",
    "form factors , exclusive weak transition amplitudes  @xcite such as @xmath22 . and",
    "the generalized parton distributions  @xcite measured in deeply virtual compton scattering are ( assuming the  handbag \" approximation ) overlaps of the initial and final lfwfs with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the gauge - invariant distribution amplitude @xmath25 defined from the integral over the transverse momenta @xmath26 of the valence ( smallest @xmath11 ) fock state provides a fundamental measure of the hadron at the amplitude level  @xcite ; they are the nonperturbative input to the factorized form of hard exclusive amplitudes and exclusive heavy hadron decays in perturbative qcd . the resulting distributions",
    "obey the dglap and erbl evolution equations as a function of the maximal invariant mass , thus providing a physical factorization scheme  @xcite . in each case , the derived quantities satisfy the appropriate operator product expansions , sum rules , and evolution equations .",
    "however , at large @xmath27 where the struck quark is far - off shell , dglap evolution is quenched  @xcite , so that the fall - off of the dis cross sections in @xmath28 satisfies inclusive - exclusive duality at fixed @xmath29    the light - front fock - state wavefunctions encode the bound state properties of hadrons in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom at the amplitude level .",
    "they display novel features , such as intrinsic gluons , asymmetric sea - quark distributions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and intrinsic heavy - quark fock states  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic charm and bottom quarks appear at large @xmath27 in the light - front wavefunctions since this minimizes the invariant mass and off - shellness of the higher fock state .",
    "one can use the operator product expansion to show that the probability of such states scales as @xmath32 in contrast to @xmath33 fall - off of abelian theory  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable observations of the selex experiment of the double - charm baryon @xmath34 in @xmath35 and @xmath36 at large @xmath37  @xcite provides compelling evidence for double - charm intrinsic fock states in the proton .",
    "the coherence of multi - particle correlations within the fock states leads to higher - twist bosonic processes such as @xmath38 ; although suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath28 , such subprocesses are important in the duality regime of fixed @xmath39 , particularly in @xmath40  @xcite . in the case of nuclei",
    ", one must include non - nucleonic  hidden color \"  @xcite degrees of freedom of the deuteron lfwf .",
    "the e791 experiments at fermilab  @xcite has shown how one can measure the valence lfwf directly from the diffractive di - jet dissociation of a high energy pion @xmath41 into two jets , nearly balancing in transverse momentum , leaving the nucleus intact .",
    "the measured pion distribution in @xmath27 and @xmath42 is similar to the form of the asymptotic distribution amplitude and the ads / cft prediction discussed below .",
    "the e791 experiment also find that the nuclear amplitude is additive in the number of nucleons when the quark jets are produced at high @xmath43 , thus giving a dramatic confirmation of  color transparency \" , a fundamental manifestation of the gauge nature of qcd  @xcite .",
    "the phase structure of hadron matrix elements is an essential feature of hadron dynamics .",
    "although the lfwfs are real for a stable hadron , they acquire phases from initial state and final state interactions .",
    "in addition , the violation of @xmath44 invariance leads to a specific phase structure of the lfwfs  @xcite .",
    "contrary to parton model expectations , the rescattering of the quarks in the final state in dis has important phenomenological consequences , such as leading - twist diffractive dis  @xcite and the sivers single - spin asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the sivers asymmetry depends on the same matrix elements which produce the anomalous magnetic moment of the target nucleon as well as the phase difference of the final - state interactions in different partial waves .",
    "the rescattering of the struck parton generates dominantly imaginary diffractive amplitudes , giving rise to an effective  hard pomeron \" exchange and a rapidity gap between the target and diffractive system , while leaving the target intact .",
    "this bjorken - scaling physics , which is associated with the wilson line connecting the currents in the virtual compton amplitude survives even in light - cone gauge .",
    "thus there are contributions to the dis structure functions which are not included in the light - front wave functions computed in isolation and can not be interpreted as parton probabilities  @xcite .",
    "diffractive deep inelastic scattering in turn leads to nuclear shadowing at leading twist as a result of the destructive interference of multi - step processes within the nucleus .",
    "in addition , multi - step processes involving reggeon exchange leads to antishadowing .",
    "in fact , because reggeon couplings are flavor specific , antishadowing is predicted to be non - universal , depending on the type of current and even the polarization of the probes in nuclear dis  @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of qcd at the amplitude level is the @xmath28-independent `` @xmath45 fixed - pole '' contribution @xmath46 to the real part of the compton amplitude , reflecting the effective contact interaction of the transverse currents  @xcite .",
    "deeply virtual compton scattering can also be studied in the timelike domain from @xmath47 ; the lepton charge asymmetry and single - spin asymmetries allow measurements of the relative phase of timelike form factors and the @xmath48 amplitude .      in principle",
    ", one can solve for the lfwfs directly from the fundamental theory using methods such as discretized light - front quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite , the transverse lattice  @xcite , lattice gauge theory moments  @xcite , dyson - schwinger techniques  @xcite , and bethe ",
    "salpeter techniques  @xcite .",
    "dlcq has been remarkably successful in determining the entire spectrum and corresponding lfwfs in one space - one time field theories  @xcite , including qcd(1 + 1 )  @xcite and supersymmetric qcd(1 + 1 )  @xcite .",
    "the dlcq boundary conditions allow a truncation of the fock space to finite dimensions while retaining the kinematic boost and lorentz invariance of light - front quantization .",
    "there are also light - front solutions for yukawa theory in physical ( 3 + 1 ) space - time dimensions  @xcite with a limited fock space . as emphasized by weinstein and",
    "vary , new effective operator methods  @xcite which have been developed for hamiltonian theories in condensed matter and nuclear physics , could also be applied advantageously to light - front hamiltonian .",
    "a review of nonperturbative light - front methods may be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "as we discuss below , one can use the ads / cft correspondence to obtain a model for hadronic light - front wavefunctions which display confinement at large inter - quark separation and conformal symmetry at short distances . in particular , the scaling and conformal properties of the lfwfs at high relative momenta agree with perturbative qcd .",
    "these ads / cft model wavefunctions could be used as an initial ansatz for a variational treatment of the light - front qcd hamiltonian .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , between strongly - coupled conformal gauge theory and weakly - coupled string theory in the 10-dimensional @xmath49 space is now providing a remarkable new insight into the hadron wavefunctions of qcd . the central mathematical principle underlying ads / cft duality is the fact that the group @xmath50 of poincar and conformal transformations of physical @xmath51 space - time has an elegant mathematical representation on @xmath52 space where the fifth dimension has the anti - de sitter warped metric .",
    "the group of conformal transformations @xmath50 in 3 + 1 space is isomorphic to the group of isometries of ads space , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 represents the coordinate in the fifth dimension .",
    "the dynamics at @xmath56 in 3 + 1 space thus matches the behavior of the theory at the boundary @xmath57 this allows one to map the physics of quantum field theories with conformal symmetry to an equivalent description in which scale transformations have an explicit representation in ads space .    even though quantum chromodynamics is a broken conformal theory , the ads / cft correspondence has led to important insights into the properties of qcd . for example , as shown by polchinski and strassler  @xcite , the ads / cft duality , modified to give a mass scale , provides a nonperturbative derivation of the empirically successful dimensional counting rules  @xcite for the leading power - law fall - off of the hard exclusive scattering amplitudes of the bound states of the gauge theory .",
    "the modified theory generates the hard behavior expected from qcd instead of the soft behavior characteristic of strings .",
    "other important applications include the description of spacelike hadron form factors at large transverse momentum  @xcite and deep inelastic scattering structure functions at small @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the power falloff of hadronic light - front wave functions ( lfwf ) including states with nonzero orbital angular momentum is also predicted  @xcite .    in the original formulation by maldacena",
    "@xcite , a correspondence was established between a supergravity string theory on a curved background and a conformally invariant @xmath58 super yang - mills theory in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "the higher dimensional theory is @xmath49 where @xmath59 is the radius of ads and the radius of the five - sphere and @xmath60 is the string scale .",
    "the extra dimensions of the five - dimensional sphere @xmath61 correspond to the @xmath62 global symmetry which rotates the particles present in the supersymmetric yang mills supermultiplet in the adjoint representation of @xmath63 . in our application to qcd , baryon number in qcd is represented as a casimir constant on @xmath64    the reason why ads / cft duality can have at least approximate applicability to physical qcd is based on the fact that the underlying classical qcd lagrangian with massless quarks is scale - invariant  @xcite",
    ". one can thus take conformal symmetry as an initial approximation to qcd , and then systematically correct for its nonzero @xmath65 function and quark masses  @xcite .",
    "conformal template \" approach underlies the banks - zak method  @xcite for expansions of qcd expressions near the conformal limit and the blm method  @xcite for setting the renormalization scale in perturbative qcd applications . in the blm method",
    "the corrections to a perturbative series from the @xmath65-function are systematically absorbed into the scale of the qcd running coupling .",
    "an important example is the  generalized crewther relation \"  @xcite which relates the bjorken and gross - llewellyn sum rules at the deep inelastic scale @xmath28 to the @xmath66 annihilation cross sections at specific commensurate scales @xmath67 .",
    "the crewther relation  @xcite was originally derived in conformal theory ; however , after blm scale setting , it becomes a fundamental test of physical qcd , with no uncertainties from the choice of renormalization scale or scheme .",
    "qcd is nearly conformal at large momentum transfers where asymptotic freedom is applicable .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that dimensional scaling for exclusive processes is observed even at relatively low momentum transfer where gluon exchanges involve relatively soft momenta  @xcite .",
    "the observed scaling of hadron scattering at moderate momentum transfers can be understood if the qcd coupling has an infrared fixed point  @xcite . in this sense , qcd resembles a strongly - coupled conformal theory .",
    "the duality between a gravity theory on @xmath68 space and a conformal gauge theory at its @xmath69-dimensional boundary requires one to match the partition functions at the @xmath70 boundary , @xmath71 .",
    "the physical string modes @xmath72 , are plane waves along the poincar coordinates with four - momentum @xmath73 and hadronic invariant mass states @xmath74 . for large-@xmath55 or small-@xmath75 , @xmath76 , where the dimension @xmath5 of the string mode must be the same dimension as that of the interpolating operator @xmath77 which creates a specific hadron out of the vacuum : @xmath78 .",
    "the physics of color confinement in qcd can be described in the ads / cft approach by truncating the ads space to the domain @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "the cutoff at @xmath81 is dual to the introduction of a mass gap @xmath82 ; it breaks conformal invariance and is responsible for the generation of a spectrum of color - singlet hadronic states .",
    "the truncation of the ads space insures that the distance between the colored quarks and gluons as they stream into the fifth dimension is limited to @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting @xmath51 theory has both color confinement at long distances and conformal behavior at short distances .",
    "the latter property allows one to derive dimensional counting rules for form factors and other hard exclusive processes at high momentum transfer .",
    "this approach , which can be described as a  bottom - up \" approach , has been successful in obtaining general properties of the low - lying hadron spectra , chiral symmetry breaking , and hadron couplings in ads / qcd  @xcite in addition to the hard scattering predictions  @xcite .    in this  classical holographic model \" , the quarks and gluons propagate into the truncated ads interior according to the ads metric without interactions . in effect , their wilson lines , which are represented by open strings in the fifth dimension , are rigid .",
    "the resulting equations for spin 0 , @xmath84 , 1 and @xmath85 hadrons on @xmath49 lead to color - singlet states with dimension @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , only the hadronic states ( dimension-@xmath88 ) @xmath89 @xmath90 pseudoscalar and vector mesons , the ( dimension-@xmath87 ) @xmath91 @xmath92 baryons , and the ( dimension-@xmath93 ) @xmath94 @xmath1 gluonium states , can be derived in the classical holographic limit  @xcite .",
    "this description corresponds to the valence fock state as represented by the light - front fock expansion .",
    "hadrons also fluctuate in particle number , in their color representations ( such as the hidden - color states  @xcite of the deuteron ) , as well as in internal orbital angular momentum .",
    "the higher fock components of the hadrons are manifestations of the quantum fluctuations of qcd ; these correspond to the fluctuations of the bulk geometry about the fixed ads metric . for spinning strings orbital excitations of hadronic states",

    "<S> the light - front fock - state wavefunctions encode the bound state properties of hadrons in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom at the amplitude level . </S>",
    "<S> one can also use the extended ads / cft space - time theory to obtain a model for hadronic light - front wavefunctions , thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level . the model wavefunctions display confinement at large inter - quark separation and conformal symmetry at short distances . in particular , the scaling and conformal properties of the lfwfs at high relative momenta agree with perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> these ads / cft model wavefunctions could be used as an initial ansatz for a variational treatment of the light - front qcd hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how hadron form factors in both the space - like and time - like regions can be predicted .     </S>",
