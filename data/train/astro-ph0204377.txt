    "the fis ( far - infrared surveyor ) is one of the focal plane instruments of the astro - f mission ( previously known as iris ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the astro - f satellite will be launched into a sun - synchronous orbit at an altitude of 750  km , which corresponds to an orbital period of 100 min .",
    "the telescope , which is cooled down to 5.15.8 k , has a 67 cm primary mirror .",
    "the major task of this mission is to carry out an all - sky survey across the 50200 @xmath2 m range .",

    "( 2000 ) analysed the iso data obtained for the high density case ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 = 60 ) from the fluctuation analysis method , which is different from our photometric method . because they assumed that the fluctuation is mainly caused by unresolved faint point sources",
    ", they could count the number of sources , even in a low flux range .",
    "we have written observing simulation software , ` fisvi ' , for an upcoming infrared survey mission , astro - f . utilizing this software ,",
    "we have estimated the performance of the far infrared surveyor ( fis ) onboard astro - f for ideal conditions .",
    "we can carry out scanning simulations with a reasonable amount of computing resources by introducing the compiled psf .",
    "the software can be used to generate virtual data sets for a data - reduction pipeline .",
    "we estimated the detection limits under various circumstances .",
    "for the case of a non - crowded source distribution , the readout noise is usually more important than the photon noise for dark patches of the sky by a factor of 1.3 to 2.5 .",
    "this means that the bright parts of the sky can be easily dominated by photon noise .",
    "the emission from the telescope is less than the interstellar background as long as the telescope temperature remains less than 6 k , but it could contribute significantly to the long - wavelength band if the temperature becomes larger than 6.5 k ( see figure [ bgr_kawada ] ) .    in crowded fields ,",
    "source confusion becomes important in identifying sources . the detection correctness becomes smaller for fainter sources .",
    "we have defined the confusion limit in such a way that the number of correctly detected sources within a 20% error becomes larger than 70% of the number of detected sources from photometry .",
    "such a definition of the confusion - dominated detection limit gives very similar values of the confusion limit based on a simple formula .",
    "the source confusion becomes larger than the detection limits by photon and readout noise only if the number of faint sources becomes much larger than a simple extension of the iras source counts down to around 10 mjy , assuming no luminosity or density evolution .",
    "recent models of source counts based on iso and scuba observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , however , predict the source distribution that is subject to significant confusion at the longest wavelength band ( wide - l ) .",
    "other bands appear to be noise - limited .",
    "the source confusion also could change the slope in @xmath6@xmath7 plots .    in this paper",
    ", we have made many simplifying assumptions concerning the sky conditions .",
    "the actual sky brightness varies from place to place .",
    "the overall statistics of the galaxy counts should be significantly influenced by irregularities of the sky backgrounds .",
    "also , in order to understand cosmological effects , we will consider various types of sed , the luminosity function , and the redshift distribution .",
    "the current version of fisvi does not take into account more complicated behaviors of the detectors .",
    "these issues will be discussed in forthcoming papers .",

    "the psf of astro - f / fis , including the entire optical path , was computed using the zemax optical simulation software package ( focus software , inc . ) .",
    "the resulting psf at @xmath8 m is shown in figure [ fig_psf ] , together with a circular aperture airy pattern .",
    "the difference between the simulated psf and the airy pattern is very small , but noticeable .",
    "the simulated psf is slightly narrower than the airy pattern , and the side - lobe is more significant .",
    "since fis detectors do not lie on the optical axis of astro - f , the psf is slightly elongated with an ellipticity of @xmath9 , but we assume the circular psf in the present simulations .",
    "since the fis covers a wide range of wavelengths , the psfs have been computed from 40 to 200 @xmath2 m at 5 @xmath2 m intervals .",

    "the detector transforms the photons into charges .",

    "we use the following convention : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant in units of aw@xmath32 and @xmath35 is a function normalised to unity at the peak value for sw ( short wavelength ) and lw ( long wavelength ) detectors .",
    "the normalised detector response functions , @xmath36 , of lw and sw bands are shown in figures [ res_sw ] and [ res_lw ] , respectively .",

    "measurements are done using a blackbody source , a filter that cuts off the photons below a certain wavelength , a winston cone , and a detector in a perfectly reflecting cavity .",
    "the lw detector has long wavelength cut - off at 200 @xmath2 m and sw detector at 110 @xmath2 m .",
    "a low - pass filter was used to cut off the photons at wavelength below the fis band .",
    "the short wavelength limits were 140 @xmath2 m for the lw detector and 40 @xmath2 m for the sw detector .",

    "we can rewrite equation ( [ eq_sums ] ) as @xmath49 since @xmath11 is independent of @xmath15 and @xmath50 , we can introduce a new function , @xmath51 , by integrating over the wavelength as @xmath52 we define this @xmath51 as the ` compiled psf ' . if we perform convolution to the image plane by using this compiled psf , we can avoid repeated wavelength integration .",
    "finally , equation ( [ eq_totcharge ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath53 this concept of the compiled psf is effective only when the number of sed type is limited . the calculation time is reduced by a factor of @xmath54 by using the compiled psf , where @xmath54 is the number of wavelength grids . with a wavelength interval of @xmath55 m",
    ", a typical @xmath54 lies between 10 and 20 . in order to carry out simulations over four square degrees in the wide - s band ,",
    "we need about 15 hours of computing time with pentium iv 1 ghz machines . by introducing compiled psf",
    ", we can accomplish such a simulation within an hour .",
    "we expect that the majority of faint point sources detected by the astro - f / fis will be external galaxies .",
    "each object will have its own sed , but most extragalactic point sources in the infrared band can be classified into four types of galaxies , i.e. , the cirrus type representing typical spiral galaxies , the m 82 type starbursts , the arp 220 type starbursts and the agn dust torus type ( rowan - robinson 2001 ) .",
    "four compiled psfs are required to accommodate these four types of seds in the simulations .",
    "the observed seds are further affected by the redshifts .",
    "we need redshifted - dependent seds for each type of source .",
    "we expect that the compiled psf will be changed with the sed types and the redshift for wide bands , but the difference was found to be very small , even for the wide - s and wide - l bands , as shown in figure [ fig_seds ] . since our main purpose is to examine the general performance of the astro - f / fis , we concentrate on simple models for the nature of the sources",
    ". we will deal with the sed types of sources , redshift distributions , and the luminosity function in the next paper in order to understand the cosmological model and the galaxy evolution through the observing simulation .",
    "though the difference between the compiled psfs computed from the flat sed and other seds is severe at some extreme cases ( @xmath56 10% difference over the area ) , we use the compiled psf computed for galaxies with the flat sed in the present paper ( i.e. , @xmath57 = constant ) ( see figure [ fig_seds ] ) . in the flat sed s case ,",

    "a psf - convolved image is generated on grids where the scanning procedure is performed . to scan a psf - convolved image",

    "we set the array of the starting point to scan on the @xmath58 ( cross - scan direction ) and the @xmath59 ( in - scan direction ) frame in the image .",
    "the fis detector arrays have 2 or 3 rows and 15 or 20 columns , and is tilted by an angle @xmath605 from the cross - scan direction in order to assure nyquist sampling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the image convolved with compiled psf was constructed on grids of @xmath74 resolution , but the accuracy of the @xmath75 integration was not good enough on such grids ( @xmath56 a few percent error ) , partly because of the tilted configuration of the detector arrays . in order to improve the accuracy of the integration , we laid finer grids over the area where the integration would be performed .",
    "we were able to reduce the integration error down to 1% by taking a three - times finer grid over the integration area .",
    "if we use a smaller grid , we can improve the accuracy of the flux and the position further , but we would need more computing time .",
    "the time integration of equation ( [ eq_totcpsf ] ) was made by dividing one sampling interval to shorter subsampling intervals in order to mimic the continuous scanning of the detector and applying the trapezoidal rule to the subsampled time series data .",
    "as the detector moves , one detector pixel integrates the signal during the subsample interval ( see figure [ fig_int_pixel ] ) .",
    "the number of subsample determines the resolution of integrated signal values .",
    "the sampling rate of 15.2 hz for lw bands corresponds to 142 which is much smaller than the pixel size , and we found that we need only two subsamples to ensure the integration accuracy over time becomes smaller than 1% ."
