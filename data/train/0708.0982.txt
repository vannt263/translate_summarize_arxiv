    "-90    -90     +    -90    -90    in recent years , feedback mechanisms from radio galaxies ( that is , galaxies which host radio - loud active galactic nuclei ) have become the method of choice for curtailing the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function in models of galaxy formation , since models without feedback tend to over - produce the number of very luminous galaxies compared to what is observed ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "many high - redshift radio galaxies lie in ( proto-)cluster environments ( e.g. venemans et al . 2003 ) and the energies provided by their radio jets ( the bulk kinetic power of the radio jets is several orders of magnitude larger than the radio luminosity ; e.g. , rawlings & saunders 1991 ) is sufficient to shut down star forming activity throughout a cluster ( rawlings & jarvis 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that powerful radio sources may be triggered by galaxy  galaxy interactions during the merging of subcluster units ( ellingson , yee & green 1991 ; simpson & rawlings 2002 ) .",
    "lower luminosity sources are also believed to be vital in shaping the galaxy luminosity function by providing a low power , but high duty cycle , mode of feedback ( e.g. , croton et al .",
    "2005 ; bower et al .  2006 ; best et al .",
    "this mode of feedback appears to be most common in the most massive galaxies , which are , of course , preferentially located in the centres of galaxy clusters .",
    "therefore there appears to be significant interplay between the formation and evolution of both the radio sources and their cluster environments . studying the environments of low - power radio sources",
    "is likely a promising route towards understanding radio galaxy feedback .",
    "however , while the radio galaxy itself can influence the thermodynamic history of its environment ( i.e. by depositing energy ) , the picture is complicated by global environmental processes such as the merging of sub - cluster units , which can temporarily boost the x - ray luminosity and temperature of the intracluster medium ( e.g. randall , sarazin & ricker  2002 ) , making such systems more readily detectable in x - ray surveys ( a matter of caution in using such x - ray detected systems as cosmological probes ) .",
    "it is essential to perform detailed studies of the radio , optical , and x - ray properties of putative dense regions in the cosmic web to ascertain how mergers and radio source activity affect the life - cycle of clusters .",
    "the luminosity and temperature of a cluster are known to follow a scaling relationship ( the @xmath3@xmath5 relation ) , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 has been measured in the range @xmath152.73 ( edge & stewart 1991 ; david , jones & forman 1995 ; allen & fabian 1998 ; markevitch 1998 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ) this is at odds with that expected for clusters formed by gravitational structure formation , with @xmath16 ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "it is thought that the disparity is due to the interruption of cooling by feedback from active galaxies , which can impart energy via outflow shocks ( for example from radio - jets or super - winds ) , or by performing work by sub - sonically inflating bubbles in the intracluster medium ( icm ; sijacki & springel 2006 ) . best  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that , given the short life - times of radio - loud agn ( 10100myr ) , episodic triggering must occur in order for feedback to quench cooling",
    ". however , much lower luminosity sources ( @xmath17whz@xmath1 ) can impart energy into the igm with a higher duty cycle than the more powerful , and rarer , sources ( best  et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "mclure et al .  (",
    "2004 ) have recently constructed a sample of radio galaxies at @xmath2 which spans three orders of magnitude in radio luminosity , but even the faintest of these sources are close to the fanaroff ",
    "riley break ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) and it is desirable to push to even fainter radio luminosities to fully investigate the radio galaxy  cluster symbiosis . in this paper",
    "we present multi - object spectroscopy of galaxies around four low - power ( @xmath18whz@xmath1 ) radio galaxies at @xmath2 in the _ subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ) _",
    "( sekiguchi et al .",
    "2001 , 2006 in prep ) .",
    "the resultant spectroscopic redshifts allow us to investigate the environments of these radio sources which could provide a large proportion of the local volume averaged heating rate if the agn luminosity function is flat below @xmath19whz@xmath1 ( best  et  al .",
    "we combine these data with x - ray observations of the radio galaxies environments in order to investigate the global environmental properties  namely the @xmath20 and @xmath21 relations .",
    "this parameter space can be used as a diagnostic of the thermodynamic history of groups or clusters , since if an agn is significantly feeding energy back into the intracluster medium ( icm ) , then the group or cluster might be expected to deviate from the standard empirical @xmath22 relation for massive systems . throughout",

    "1994 ) placed an upper limit of @xmath29 as appropriate for our study , so we selected radio sources whose optical counterparts are resolved and have @xmath30 , since the tightness of the hubble diagram for radio galaxies allows redshifts to be estimated from a single magnitude , and we aim to target moderate redshift environments ( cruz et al .",
    "magnitude diagrams were produced for @xmath31 regions around each radio galaxy and the four optically brightest radio galaxies whose environments displayed a red sequence were selected for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "this selection was simply performed ` by eye '  if the colour - magnitude diagram displayed an overdensity of points at @xmath32 with tight scatter in colour space .",
    "note that local x - ray properties were not taken into account when choosing the target radio galaxies  this is simply an optical selection of radio galaxies .",
    "masks were designed using the ldss-2 mask preparation software , with objects along the red sequence ( typically using a colour cut of width 0.3magnitudes ) included in the input file ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this software allows relative priorities to be assigned to targets , which were set to be equal to the magnitudes of the galaxies , to increase the likelihood of successfully determining redshift .",
    "observations were conducted using the medium - red ( 300 lines / mm , @xmath33 ) grism of ldss-2 in multi - object mode on the 6.5-m magellan telescope in las campanas , chile over the nights 1720 october 2003 ( effective resolution 13.3 ) .",
    "the mos frames were trimmed for overscan , flat - fielded , rectified , cleaned and wavelength calibrated using a sequence of python routines ( d. kelson , priv .",

    "although flux - calibration and response correction is not necessary for redshift determination via cross - correlation , we perform these steps in order to present a sample of the spectra in figure 2 .      the _ sxdf _ incorporates a deep , large - area x - ray mosaic with xmm - newton , consisting of 7 overlapping pointings covering @xmath151.3deg@xmath35 region of the high - galactic latitude sky with an exposure time of 100ks in the central field ( in separate exposures ) and 50ks in the flanking fields ( see table  2 ) .",

    "the possibility that jeg 2 is an unresolved source complex can not of course be completely ruled out given its low signal to noise .",
    "given the relative weakness of all of the x - ray sources , we consider that the extraction radii used are close to optimum to provide the best signal to noise in the extracted spectra . ancillary response files ( arfs ) containing the telescope effective area , filter transmission and quantum efficiency curves were created for the cluster spectra ( taking into account the fact that the extraction regions are extended ) , and were checked to confirm that the correct extraction area calculations ( complicated with the exclusion of contaminating point sources , etc . ) had been performed .",

    "the @xmath105 measure is perhaps the best tool for a first - order quantitative analysis of a cluster environment  it only relies on an approximate cluster redshift ( in order to calculate the angular radius of the counting aperture ) , and a satisfactorily deep photometric catalog ( hill & lilly 1991 ) .",
    "it has been shown to correlate well with the more complex @xmath106 statistic ( longair & seldner 1979 ) , which is a more rigorous measure of the density of galaxies in space when spectroscopic data is lacking , but when the shape of the luminosity function is known ( see uses in e.g. farrah et al .",
    "2004 , wold et al . 2000 , 2001 ) . in physical terms",
    "@xmath106 is the amplitude of the galaxy - galaxy spatial correlation function : @xmath107 , where @xmath27 is typically 1.82.4 ( lilje & efstathiou 1988 , moore et al .",
    "1994 , croft , dalton & efstathiou 1999 ) , though the low end of the range is typically chosen , with @xmath108 ( e.g. yee & ellingson 2003 ) .",
    "both these measures can be translated to the more familiar abell richness scale .",
    "@xmath105 is calculated by choosing a target and counting the number of galaxies within 0.5  mpc in the magnitude range @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the magnitude of the target galaxy , which in this case we choose to be the radio galaxies .",
    "a field correction is applied by subtracting the expected number of galaxies in this magnitude range from a control field ( this control field was different for each target , chosen to be centred on a random point , @xmath541mpc from the radio galaxy ) .",
    "note that the @xmath105 statistic will be inaccurate in cases where there is strong differential evolution between the radio galaxy luminosity and companion cluster galaxies , but this can be compensated for by choosing the second or third brightest galaxy in the aperture and applying the same method .",
    "more importantly , it is clear from the spectroscopic results that the @xmath105 statistic is contaminated by line - of - sight structures not associated with the physical environment of the radio galaxies .",
    "this is particularly evident for jeg4  the slightly higher redshift structure suggested by the number of @xmath111 galaxies have magnitudes and colours that not only re - inforce the original red - sequence selection , but will be included in the @xmath105 calculation .",
    "thus it is important to note that this method can only provide a very rudimentary environmental analysis  a more sophisticated method is required .",
    "for this reason , we also calculate @xmath78  where ` gc ' stands for ` galaxy - cluster centre ' .",
    "this is a potentially useful statistic : derived solely from photometry , it has been shown to be in excellent agreement with its spectroscopic counterpart , and can be used as a predictor for global cluster properties such as the velocity dispersion , virial mass and x - ray temperature ( yee & ellingson 2003 ) .",
    "thus , we have another parameter to compare with our spectroscopically derived cluster velocity dispersions and x - ray observations , as well as a quantitative description of the richness of the radio galaxies environments .",
    "a full derivation of the @xmath78 statistic was made by longair & seldner ( 1979 ) , and has been used in a practical sense by several other authors ( see wold et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , farrah et al .",
    "2003 , yee & lpez - cruz 1999 ) , so we will not give a detailed procedure here , but the form of the statistic is given by : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the surface density of field galaxies brighter than a limit @xmath114 , @xmath115 is the angular diameter distance to @xmath116 , @xmath117 is an integration constant ( @xmath118 ) and @xmath119 is the integral luminosity function to a luminosity corresponding to @xmath114 at @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath120 is the amplitude of the angular correlation function , calculated by comparing the net excess of galaxies within 0.5  mpc of the target with the number of background sources expected for an identical aperture in the field : @xmath121 .",
    "the conversion to @xmath78 effectively deprojects @xmath120 from the celestial sphere into 3-d space .",
    "perhaps the most important factor to consider is the choice of luminosity function , although @xmath78 is reasonably tolerant of incorrect parameters ( as long as they are within @xmath122% of their true values ) .",
    "we estimate the shape of the luminosity function at @xmath123 and @xmath124 by using the semi - analytic catalog output of the millenium simulation ( bower et al .",
    "2006 , springel et al .",
    "2000 ) . at each epoch",
    ", we fit a schechter function to the absolute ( simulated ) @xmath125-band magnitude counts , fixing the faint end slope @xmath126 .",
    "the resulting @xmath127 are ( @xmath128 mag ,  0.0042 mpc@xmath129 ) and ( @xmath130 mag ,  0.0021 mpc@xmath129 ) at @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "the relevant luminosity function used in equation 1 is evaluated from @xmath131 to @xmath132 , where the faint end is in a relatively flat part of the distribution , and the bright end is expected to include most of the cluster galaxies ( note that changing these limits by @xmath121 magnitude does not change the value of @xmath78 by more than 1@xmath56 ) .",
    "the results are presented in table  4 .",
    "it is important to note that jeg2 appears to have an environment almost consistent with the field ( although , as noted the @xmath105 statistic is likely to suffer contamination ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the apparent red - sequence around the radio galaxy , which would suggest a moderate overdensity .",
    "however , we have seen that the very high velocity dispersion for this group , and structure in the velocity distribution might affect the richness estimates if the group is spatially spread out . jeg1 and jeg4 are moderately rich environments ( they have very similar levels of overdensity , although note that jeg4 is contaminated by a slightly higher redshift line - of - sight structure , and so its true richness is likely to be slightly lower),consistent with rich groups .",
    "jeg3 is also an overdensity , but the statistics suggest that the cluster is no more rich than jeg1 or jeg4 .",
    "thus , the radio galaxy selection is detecting moderately rich groups of galaxies .",
    "the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec was used to fit x - ray spectral models to the cluster spectra . in terms of x - rays from galaxy clusters",
    ", it is commonly believed that the emission is predominantly due to the hot cluster gas trapped in the potential well , absorbed by the hydrogen column density within our own galaxy ( i.e. little in the way of internal cluster absorption is expected ) .",
    "the spectra therefore were fitted with a standard model comprised of a _ mekal _ hot plasma emission spectrum , together with a _",
    "wabs _ photo - electric absorption model ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) . due to the small number of counts ,",
    "the hydrogen column of the absorption was fixed at the galactic hydrogen column density in the line of sight to the subaru pointings : @xmath133atoms @xmath134 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) . also the redshifts were fixed at the values given in table  4 . the temperature and metallicity were left free to optimize .",
    "acceptable spectral fits were found for all the clusters ( though only a small number of counts is seen from jeg2 ) , and these results are given in table  4 .",
    "we present the best fit gas temperature and metallicity ( with respect to the solar value ) , the errors being 90% for a single interesting parameter , and the ( 0.3@xmath1110kev ) absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity .",
    "also tabulated are the best fit @xmath135 values and the number of degrees of freedom . for none of the clusters were there sufficient counts to warrant the use of a more complex model .",
    "we attempted to rebin the spectra into five counts per bin , with a fit based on cash statistics ( i.e. not subtracting the background in order to maintain counting statistics , cash 1979 ) , however this does not provide stronger constraints on @xmath136 or @xmath80 compared to the adopted method .",
    "the data and best - fit models are shown in figure  4 .",
    "with the exception of jeg2 , the radio galaxies in each of our fields have environmental properties consistent with moderately rich groups at @xmath2 , in terms of their density statistic and x - ray properties . despite the presence of a clear red sequence in the field of jeg2 ( fig .  1 )",
    ", a simple @xmath105 environmental measure suggests that the environment is consistent with the field .",
    "however , it is likely that this is in fact a cluster of similar richness to jeg1 , jeg3 and jeg4 given that there are several nearby galaxies with colours and spectroscopic redshifts close to the radio galaxy .",
    "the low - number statistics for this system makes it difficult to make any robust comments about the radio - galaxy environment , except that this is probably a dynamically young group .",
    "there is some evidence for a sheet at @xmath137 ( simpson et al . in prep ) and jeg2 may simply lie in an overdensity within this stucture .",
    "a large projected distribution of red galaxies around this group would in part explain the failure of the @xmath78 statistic to detect an overdensity : it could be possible that the control aperture itself is contaminated by the larger stucture .",
    "our observations of jeg1 and jeg4 also do not contain enough confirmed spectroscopic members at the radio galaxies redshifts to comment on their environments from a spectroscopic standpoint .",
    "the wide - angle radio tail of jeg1 suggests rapid movement through a dense medium ( s06 ) , consistent with a group - group merger ( e.g. jetha et al .",
    "there is insufficient spectroscopic data to confirm this though .",
    "furthermore , in the case of jeg4 , our results could be affected by a background group , although it is not clear that this is contributing significantly to the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this slightly more distant group could also be re - enforcing the strength of the red sequence ( fig .  1 ) , and is a cautionary point regarding selection in this way .",
    "the x - ray luminosities derived by fitting thermal models to the x - ray spectra are remarkably constant over our radio galaxy sample , with the environment of jeg3 the hottest and intrinsically the most luminous ( we note that the small number of counts seen from jeg2 results in a poorly constrained model ) . in figure 5",
    "we compare these clusters properties with the @xmath138@xmath5 relation of helsdon & ponman s ( 2000 ) study of galaxy groups and low - luminosity clusters , more luminous and massive systems from wu , xue & fang ( 1999 ) , as well as more intermediate redshift ( @xmath139 ) x - ray selected groups / clusters from the _ xmm_-large scale survey ( _ xmm_-lss ; willis et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "firstly , the four clusters all have high-@xmath138 and high-@xmath136 compared to the group sample , indicating that they bridge the gap between groups and rich clusters  a relatively unexplored region of parameter space .",
    "this is likely due to selection effects , thus there is potential in investigating these types of environment using a selection technique similar to the one outlined in this work .",
    "however , we note that the radio selected environments are quite similar to x - ray selected groups / clusters at similar redshifts , detected in the _",
    "xmm_-lss ( willis et al .  2006 ) .",
    "we show also the disparity between the slopes of the @xmath3@xmath5 relation for groups ( helsdon & ponman  2000 ) and rich clusters ( wu , xue & fang  1999 ) , which differ by a factor @xmath152 .",
    "this is probably a real effect ",
    "the steepening of the slope for groups reflects the fact that these systems have a propsenity to exhibit deviations from the relation seen for the more massive systems due to processes other than cooling ( willis et al .",
    "2005 ; ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 ) .",
    "note that all the empirical relations found for groups and clusters are steeper than that expected for pure gravitational structure formation ( kaiser 1986 ) ; this implies that feedback as a source of energy input is important over all scales of clusters , but is more dominant in the low mass systems .",
    "one can also compare the cluster x - ray luminosity and velocity dispersion with the @xmath138@xmath56 relations for these environments ( fig .",
    "although our small numer statistics provide only loose constraints on our environmental parameters , all our environments appear to have slightly large velocity dispersions compared to the temperature of the intracluster gas , although this is not statistically significant . once again , the velocity dispersions and temperatures reveal that these radio galaxies inhabit intermediate environments between groups and clusters .",
    "a similar picture is revealed by the @xmath3@xmath4 relationship , with all clusters having slightly large @xmath4 for their @xmath3 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observed velocity dispersions for other radio / optically selected samples ( e.g. rasumussen et al .",
    "2006 ; popesso et al .",
    "2007 ) .    for the remainder of the discussion we concentrate on jeg3 , which has a spectroscopically - confirmed sample large enough to comment on the mpc - scale environment of the radio galaxy .",
    "optically , the radio galaxy is intriguing : it appears to be morphologically disturbed , with a blue and red part , suggestive of a recent or ongoing interaction triggering star - formation .",
    "in fact , closer inspection of the spectra ( and images ) provide unambiguous evidence that the blue compenent is actually a strongly lensed background agn or starburst galaxy at @xmath140  not associated with the group ( figure  7 ) .",
    "this high redshift object does not affect our results in any way , other than the fact that without the spectroscopic confirmation , this might be classified as a merger from the optical images alone . in terms of the radio emission , we are confident that the majority of the emission originates in the lensing source  i.e. the original selection of this target is still secure ( the morphology and position of the radio emission support this , see fig .",
    "6 ) . in terms of the impact from x - ray emission from the lensed galaxy",
    ", we also estimate that our measurements of the x - ray luminosity of the group will not be affected .",
    "the main bulk of the x - ray emission appears to be offset from the radio galaxy itself ( fig .",
    "6 ) and the data were cleaned for point source emission prior to spectral fitting (  2.2 ) . in the case that the point source is not cleaned , we estimate the impact on our measurement of @xmath3 : if the lensed galaxy is a starburst , then we expect the x - ray luminosity to be of order @xmath141w ( based on an x - ray stack of @xmath142 bm / bx galaxies , reddy & steidel 2004 ) , although this will be boosted by the lens .",
    "if it is an agn , then we might expect the x - ray luminosity to be higher by a factor @xmath152 ( lehmer et al . 2005 ) . in both cases , this has a negligible impact on our results .",
    "the most obvious feature of jeg3 s environment is the apparent spatial offset between the radio galaxy itself and the bulk of galaxies at the group redshift of 0.649 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , coincident with the dominant source of x - ray emission .",
    "the galaxy s radio lobe morphology is suggestive of infall through a dense intracluster medium towards this higher density region . in fig .",
    "6 we represent the relative velocities of galaxies about the central redshift , indicating objects with @xmath143 .",
    "note that there are two other radio galaxies in this group ; one @xmath15@xmath144 to the west of the target radio galaxy , and the other ( frii source ) several more arcminutes further to the west .",
    "spectroscopic observations of these objects ( simpson et al .  in prep ) show that neither of them is associated with the structure surrounding jeg3 .",
    "these radio galaxies are not associated with the @xmath137 structure identified around the radio galaxy in this work ( see simpson et al . in prep ) .",
    "the radio galaxy appears to be associated with a small group interacting with the main body of the structure , thus it is not unreasonable to associate the triggering of the radio galaxy with this interaction .",
    "this is a scenario which has been seen in other radio galaxy environments , at both high and low redshifts , and over a wide range of radio powers ( simpson & rawlings 2002 ) .",
    "for example , the high redshift radio galaxy tnj1338@xmath111942 ( @xmath145 , venemans  et  al .",
    "2003 ) belongs to a ` proto - cluster ' , but is offset from the centre of the overdensity .",
    "similarly at low - redshift , the frii source cygnus a ( @xmath146 ) is involved in an cluster - cluster merger ( e.g. ledlow  et  al .",
    "2005 ) , with the radio - source offset from the main overdensity ( owen  et  al .",
    "x - ray mapping of this cluster revealed hot ( presumably ) shocked gas between the two main peaks of the x - ray emission in the two sub - cluster units ( markevitch  et  al .",
    "1999 ) , consistent with the model of head - on cluster merging .",
    "these well studied radio galaxies are examples of the most luminous objects at their redshifts , whereas the luminosities of the radio galaxies in this work are modest in comparison .",
    "triggering within interacting sub - cluster units seems to be responsible for a proportion of radio - galaxies , and this appears to have been happening at all epochs , and over a wide range of luminosities .",
    "the triggering of the radio galaxy could have occurred via galaxy - galaxy interactions in its immediate group , while the x - ray emission seems to be centred on the richer group in which gas is plausibly being heated by gravitational processes .",
    "however , there is a further complication to the @xmath3@xmath5 relationship , in that the outcome of the interaction between two sub - groups is a ` boosting ' of the x - ray luminosity and temperature of the resulting cluster ( randall , sarazin & ricker  2002 ) . in general this",
    "will temporarily ( i.e. for a few 100myr ) enhance both @xmath3 and @xmath5 , before the cluster settles down to its equilibrium value .",
    "it is not clear what stage of interaction this environment is in .",
    "given the relatively large offset between the x - ray emission and the radio galaxy , we postulate that this is in an early stage .",
    "in these environments it appears that we are witnessing radio galaxy activity and group - group merging / interaction at the same time .",
    "although this may hint at radio galaxy triggering in the cluster assembly phase , this does not imply that all clusters containing a radio galaxy are in an unrelaxed state ",
    "most relaxed clusters also contain a central radio source .",
    "this is interesting in that it appears that radio galaxy activity can be important in the thermodynamic history of the cluster environment over a wide range of scales ( i.e. groups to massive clusters ) and various stages of development .",
    "following the assumption made in equation 4 of miley ( 1980 ) , and adopting an expansion speed of @xmath147 ( e.g. scheuer 1995 ) , we estimate the jet power of jeg3 to be of the order 0.51@xmath14810@xmath149w , which is comparable to the x - ray luminosity of the cluster ( the expected contribution to the x - ray luminosity from the radio galaxy itself is not significant ) . although the similarity in power is likely coincidental , it is interesting , because the radio output of this low - power source appears to be sufficient to balance the radiative cooling of the gas .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the radio galaxy could keep up this balance over a long period : this mechanical injection will end long before the main merger between the two groups stops imparting energy to the system , given the expected timescales of radio activity ( @xmath150@xmath151yr , parma et al .",
    "2002 ) which will likely be the dominant event in the pre - equilibrium thermodynamic history of the cluster .",
    "nevertheless , since the radio - galaxy appears to have been triggered early in the life - time of the cluster ( the centres of the radio and x - ray emission are separated by @xmath15200kpc , fig .",
    "6 ) , it could be important for providing significant energy input to the icm , and therefore raising its entropy .",
    "subaru suprimecam thumbnails in @xmath152 bands , clearly showing the distinction between a red component ` a ' and blue component ` b ' .",
    "the spectra unambiguously identify ` b ' with a galaxy at @xmath140 , strongly lensed by the foreground component ` a ' .",
    "the emission lines at the very blue end of the spectrum ` b ' are civ , oiii ] and ciii ] in emission , securing the redshift .",
    "fe iii is seen in absorption at 2587  and 2600.,width=336 ]",
    "we have presented multi - object ( low dispersion survey spectrograph 2 ) spectroscopy , combined with complimentary radio ( vla ) and x - ray ( _ xmm - newton _ ) observations of the mpc - scale environments of a sample of low - power ( @xmath153whz@xmath1 ) @xmath2 galaxies in the _ subaru - xmm newton deep field _",
    "( simpson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the radio galaxies targeted all appear to inhabit moderately rich groups , with remarkably similar x - ray properties , with jeg3 ( vla0033 in simpson et al .",
    "2006 ) being the hottest and residing in the richest environment . a statistical interpretation of the environment of jeg2 ( vla0011 in simpson et al . 2006 ) would suggest that it does not belong to a cluster , but this could be in part due to the spatial distribution of the galaxies  the other evidence that this is a relatively rich group is compelling : there is a relatively strong red sequence and extended x - ray emission seen at this location ( suggesting a gravitationally bound structure ) , and the spectroscopic data ( although dominated by small number statistics ) suggests that this is indeed a group , or part of a much larger structure , albeit one that is not relaxed . also , three of the radio galaxies exhibit extended lobe morphology that suggest movement through a dense intracluster medium , again hinting that these systems are undergoing dynamical evolution .",
    "our analysis concentrates on the environment of jeg3 , which presents us with a ` snap - shot ' of radio - galaxy and cluster evolution at @xmath137 .",
    "overall , this is the richest environment we have studied , and the spectroscopic data reveal sub - structure : the radio galaxy belongs to a small group of galaxies which appears to be interacting ( merging ) with a larger group of galaxies .",
    "the x - ray emission for this system is associated with the richer , but radio - quiet group .",
    "we postulate that the radio emission has been triggered by a galaxy - galaxy merger within its local group .",
    "although this may be providing some feedback to the icm ( indeed , the radio output is capable of balancing the overall radiative cooling ) , the eventual group - group interaction will boost the overall x - ray luminosity and temperature .",
    "this process will take longer than the life - time of the radio - source , and so might be the dominating event in the thermodynamic fate of the environment .",
    "this scenario is not dissimilar to the situation with other radio galaxies at both high redshift , and in the local universe .",
    "moreover , radio - triggering within sub - cluster units appears to be important for a proportion of the radio galaxy population over all epochs and luminosities .",
