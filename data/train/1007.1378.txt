    "in the early papers on the subject , the motivation for the probabilistic analysis of algorithms was to alleviate the glum of worst - case analyses by a brighter ` average - case ' scenario .",
    "this optimism was stirred by early analyses of simple , greedy - type algorithms , showing that these perform rather well on randomly generated input instances , at least for certain ranges of the parameters .",
    "examples of such analyses include grimmett and mcdiarmid  @xcite ( independent set problem ) , achlioptas and molloy  @xcite ( graph coloring ) , and frieze and suen  @xcite ( @xmath6-sat ) . yet , remarkably , in spite of 30 years of research , for many problems no efficient algorithms , howsoever sophisticated ,",
    "have been found to outperform those simple greedy algorithms .",
    "the independent set problem in random graphs @xmath0 is a case in point . recall that @xmath0 is a graph on @xmath9 vertices obtained by choosing @xmath10 edges uniformly at random ( without replacement ) .",
    "we say that @xmath0 has a property _ with high probability _ if the probability that the property holds tends to 1 as @xmath11 .",
    "one of the earliest results in the theory of random graphs is a non - constructive argument showing that for @xmath12 the independence number of @xmath0 is @xmath13 w.h.p .",
    "grimmett and mcdiarmid  @xcite analyzed a simple algorithm that just constructs an inclusion - maximal independent set greedily on @xmath0 : it yields an independent set of size @xmath14 w.h.p .",
    ", about half the maximum size .",
    "but no algorithm is known to produce an independent set of size @xmath15 for any fixed @xmath5 in polynomial time with a non - vanishing probability , neither on the basis of a rigorous analysis , nor on the basis of experiments or other evidence .",
    "in fact , devising such an algorithm is probably the most prominent open problem in the algorithmic theory of random graphs  @xcite .",
    "( however , note that one can find a maximum independent set w.h.p .  by trying all @xmath16 possible sets of size @xmath17 . )",
    "matters are no better for sparse random graphs . if we let @xmath1 denote the average degree , then non - constructive arguments yield @xmath18 for the regime @xmath19 . in the case",
    "@xmath20 , the proof of this fact is via a simple second moment argument  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath21 , the second moment argument breaks down and additional methods such as large deviations inequalities are needed  @xcite . yet in either case , no algorithm is known to find an independent set of size @xmath22 in polynomial time with a non - vanishing probability , while ` greedy ' yields an independent set of size @xmath23 w.h.p.in the sparse case , the time needed for exhaustive search scales as @xmath24 , i.e. , the complexity grows as @xmath25 decreases .    in the present paper",
    "we explore the reason for the apparent ` hardness ' of finding large independent sets in random graphs .",
    "the focus is on sparse random graphs , both conceptually and computationally the most difficult case .",
    "we exhibit a phase transition in the structure of the problem that occurs as the size of the independent sets passes the point @xmath26 up to which efficient algorithms are known to succeed . roughly speaking ,",
    "we show that independent sets of of sizes bigger than @xmath22 form an intricately ragged landscape , in which local - search algorithms are likely to get stuck .",
    "thus , ironically , instead of showing that the ` average case ' scenario is brighter , we end up suggesting that random graphs provide a rich source of worst - case examples .",
    "taking into account the ( substantially ) different nature of the independent set problem , our work complements the results obtained in  @xcite for random constraint satisfaction problem such as @xmath6-sat or graph coloring and in @xcite for and a wide class of symmetric csps .",
    "furthermore , very recently b. rossman  @xcite obtained a monotone circuit lower bound for the clique problem on random graphs that is exponential in the size of the clique .",
    "the setup of  @xcite is somewhat orthogonal to our contribution , as we are concerned with the case that the size of the desired object ( i.e. , the independent set ) is linear in the number of vertices , while  @xcite deals with the case that the size of the clique is @xmath27 in terms of the order of the graph .",
    "nevertheless , the punchline of viewing random graphs as a source of computational hardness is similar .      throughout the paper we will be dealing with sparse random graphs where the average degree @xmath1 is ` large ' remains bounded as @xmath11 . to express this",
    ", we will refer to functions @xmath28 that tends to zero as @xmath25 gets large .",
    "` large ' is that the sparse random graph @xmath0 is not connected .",
    "this implies , for instance , that algorithms can find independent sets of size @xmath29 for some @xmath30 by optimizing carefully over the small tree components of @xmath0 .",
    "our results / proofs actually carry over to the case that @xmath31 tends to infinity as @xmath9 grows , but to keep matters as simple as possible , we will focus on fixed @xmath25 in this extended abstract . ] in this case @xmath32 and the greedy algorithm finds independent sets of size @xmath33 w.h.p . , where @xmath34 for large @xmath25 .",
