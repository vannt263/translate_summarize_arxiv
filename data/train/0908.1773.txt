    "stars with an initial mass exceeding @xmath12 end their life when their core collapses to a compact remnant and the outer layers are ejected in a powerful explosion , a supernova ( sn ) . if the outer hydrogen envelope of the star is still in place at the time of the explosion , the sn is characterized by strong h lines and is classified as type ii ( see * ? ? ? * for a primer on sn classification ) .",
    "there are however cases when the outer layers of the star have been lost before the explosion .",
    "in particular , if the h envelope was lost but the he envelope was retained , the sn shows he lines and is classified as a type ib , while if both the h and he shells were lost neither h nor he lines are seen and the sn is classified as type ic .",
    "collectively , the class of stripped - envelope sne is called sneib / c .",
    "type ib sne are rarer than type ic sne .",
    "these subclasses should not be thought of as rigid separations , but rather as an indication of what is probably a continuum of properties .",
    "for example , evidence of residual h lines has been claimed in some sneib ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the study of stripped - envelope sne gained momentum with the discovery that some extremely energetic sneic ( `` hypernovae '' : hne ) are linked to gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "thereafter , various studies of sneib / c have been performed , both of individual sne [ e.g.  sn1999ex @xcite ; sn2004aw @xcite ] , and systematic ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some sneib / c have also been found in association with x - ray flashes ( xrf ) , the softer and weaker versions of grbs @xcite : the snic 2006aj @xcite and the snib 2008d @xcite . while the nature of the xrf is debated in both cases @xcite",
    ", both sne turned out to be less energetic explosions than the grb / sne , but still significantly more energetic than typical sneib / c @xcite , which release @xmath13erg of energy ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is now clear that sneic , and to some extent also sneib , show a large spread of properties ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "studies of various individual objects have begun to paint a picture where the so - called ` typical ' sneib / c , such as sn1994i [ e.g.  @xcite ] are just a subset of this extended family .",
    "thus , the definition of typical may need revising .",
    "the mass of the progenitor stars of sneib / c is not constrained , except that it must be larger than the minimum mass to reach core collapse ( @xmath14 ) , if the progenitor was a single star .",
    "the final fate of massive stars depends mostly on mass , but also on other properties , such as metallicity , rotation , and magnetic fields .",
    "these dependencies on often poorly known quantities add some uncertainty to the determination of the properties of the progenitor from those of the sn ejecta . presently , snib / c observations and models indicate that the basic sn properties ( e.g.  the kinetic energy liberated in the explosion , @xmath15 , the mass ejected , @xmath16 ) are apparently related to the progenitor s mass @xcite .",
    "it takes very massive stars ( m@xmath17 ) , possibly of low metallicity , to make a grb in a highly aspherical explosion that leaves behind a black hole @xcite .",
    "less massive stars may still collapse to a black hole , possibly via fallback @xcite , but not give rise to a grb [ e.g.  sne 2002ap , @xcite or 1997ef , @xcite ] . at lower masses still [ m@xmath18 , @xcite , at least if the effect of rotation is not considered ]",
    ", the star collapses to a neutron star and may eject some material at relativistic velocities , but in this case the relativistic outflow is less energetic and is observed as an x - ray flash [ e.g.  sn2006aj @xcite ] .",
    "these less energetic explosions may be less asymmetric @xcite .",
    "one general feature of sne ib / c is that their progenitors must have lost at least the outer hydrogen envelope .",
    "if a hydrogen envelope more massive than @xmath19 is left , the star would probably have a rsg structure at the time of core collapse , and the sn light curve would be influenced initially by hydrogen recombination and appear as a type ii light curve .",
    "some transitional objects like sn1993j only had a very small hydrogen envelope , whose presence did not affect the light curve significantly but was responsible for the type ii spectrum this sn displayed early on @xcite .",
    "spectroscopically , after an early type ii phase sn1993j turned to a type ib , and is therefore known as an sniib .",
    "only few sneiib have been observed , and little is known about their spread in mass and energy .",
    "exactly how a star manages to preserve just a thin shell of h is debated .",
    "the scenarios are different depending on whether the star was single or a member of an interacting binary . in the former case ,",
    "a mass loss occurs via a radiatively driven stellar wind ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this can be effective at relatively high masses ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "stars with masses of @xmath21 may end their lives with only a thin h shell left in place @xcite .",
    "such stars would be classified as wrl or wrh . however , this mechanism is much less efficient for less luminous stars .",
    "yet , the inference for events such as sn1993j is that the progenitor had a mass of @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the latter scenario , binary interaction , seems more appealing .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that an sniib is a result of the spiral - in of a low - mass companion into a massive star , which causes the ejection of most of the massive star s h - rich envelope .",
    "this is probably a good scenario to produce an energetic explosion , because it can explain both how the core gains angular momentum from spiral - in , and how most of the envelope is ejected by spiral - in heating .",
    "there is some observational evidence in support of the binary scenario : for sn1993j a spectroscopic companion has been observed @xcite .",
    "evidence of a binary companion has also been claimed for the sniib 2001ig @xcite , while for the snib 2008ax @xcite suggest that binary interaction may be a more viable scenario than that of a single star .",
    "a similar debate exists also regarding the origin of sne ib / c ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn2003bg was initially classified as a broad - lined snic @xcite , but it soon developed a broad h@xmath23  p - cygni feature as well as he  i  lines , making it a sniib .",
    "this is the first sniib for which broad lines have been observed , suggesting that it is a sniib hypernova .",
    "the optical data of sn2003bg are presented in a companion paper @xcite . in the nebular phase",
    "the spectra were similar to those of sneib / c , but evidence of h may be present in the form of a weak , flat - topped h@xmath23  emission , reminiscent of sn1993j .",
    "additionally , sn2003bg was exceptional for its radio luminosity .",
    "@xcite suggest that the observed radio light curve can be interpreted as the signature of sub - relativistic ejecta ( with velocity @xmath24 ) producing synchrotron radiation as they impacted into a medium that may have had the properties of a wr - star wind ( mass loss rate @xmath25yr@xmath4 , wind velocity @xmath26 km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "they also suggest that the wind may have been highly variable , especially just before the explosion .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation of the xrf - sn2006aj , which was probably surrounded by a thick wind shell [ @xcite , but see @xcite ] .",
    "interestingly , the radio light curve of sn2003bg and that of sn2001ig were very similar .",
    "the available evidence therefore suggests some similarity among all sneiib , despite clear differences in the ejected mass and the kinetic energy of the explosion : for sn1993j @xcite estimated an ejected mass of @xmath27 and an explosion @xmath15  of @xmath28erg , while for sn2001ig @xcite estimate an ejected mass of @xmath29 below a velocity of 4300 km  s@xmath4 .    here",
    "we concentrate on extracting the basic properties of sn2003bg , and hence of the progenitor star and of the explosion . in order to do this",
    "we model the light curve and the spectra in both the early photospheric phase and the late nebular phase .",
    "observations of sn2003bg started very soon after the putative explosion date ( 2003 feb 25 ut ) , and cover the evolution of the sn for almost one year , extending into the nebular phase ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the peak phase was unfortunately not covered , and there is a gap in the data at the onset of the linear decline phase .",
    "still , the available data make it possible to constrain the properties of the sn reasonably accurately , especially in view of the availability of both early and late spectra .",
    "we have modelled 10 spectra , of which 8 were obtained around the peak and 2 in the nebular phase .",
    "combining the analysis of the outer part of the ejecta conducted by means of the early - time spectra and the determination of the properties of the inner , slow - moving ejecta made possible by the nebular spectra , both the density and the abundance stratification in the sn ejecta can be determined .",
    "unlike type ia sne , the modelling of sne ib / c must establish both @xmath15  and @xmath16simultaneously .",
    "as these are the two parameters that play the major role in determining both the light curve and the spectra , clearly a reliable solution must be able to reproduce simultaneously both the spectral evolution and the light curve .",
    "as is well known , the solution of the light curve alone is degenerate to @xmath15  and @xmath16  if both are allowed to vary @xcite , as is the case for sneib / c .",
    "the first steps to obtaining a solution are therefore to consider that : i ) the light curve has a rather narrow peak : the presence of h and he does not influence the light curve much , because the h shell must be thin and he does not contribute significantly to the opacity .",
    "ii ) the earliest spectra have broad lines , similar to but not quite as broad as sn2002ap @xcite .",
    "iii ) the brightness of sn2003bg at peak suggests that it synthesized @xmath30 of @xmath7ni .",
    "this is more than in ` normal ' sneib / c , and comparable to non - grb hypernovae such as sne1997ef or 1997dq @xcite , and the xrf - sne 2006aj @xcite or 2008d @xcite .",
    "the early - time spectra were modelled using a monte carlo radiative transfer code .",
    "the code assumes that the sn luminosity emerges from a sharp , grey photosphere ( schuster - schwarzschild approximation ) .",
    "this approximation is valid if most @xmath31-rays and positrons produced in the radiactive decay of @xmath7ni  to @xmath7co  and hence to @xmath7fe  deposit their energy , which is eventually thermalised and converted into optical photons , below the photosphere .",
    "this is the case in the early phases of a type i sn . using as input the sn luminosity and the velocity of the photosphere at the desired epoch of the model ( velocity and time give the photospheric radius since the expansion of sn ejecta is homologous :",
    "@xmath32 ) , an approximate effective temperature at the photosphere can be obtained assuming black body emission ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is stefan - boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "photons emitted at the photosphere propagate in the expanding ejecta , where radiative equilibrium is assumed .",
    "photons can undergo electron scattering and they can interact with spectral lines . in the latter case , photon branching",
    "is explicitly considered @xcite .",
    "this process allows photons to shift from wavelengths where line opacity is very high to spectral regions where line opacity is low , and thus to escape the sn envelope , and it is essential in shaping the spectra of type i sne .",
    "level populations and the ionization structure in the sn envelope are computed taking into account deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) using a nebular approximation as discussed in and .",
    "this approximation has been shown to reproduce well the effects of non - lte @xcite .",
    "iterating a series of mc experiments , a temperature structure in the ejecta is then computed .",
    "finally , the emerging flux is recorded using an efficient formal integral approach @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the observed flux requires the values of the distance and the reddening to the sn .",
    "the code has been applied to a number of type i sne ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "apart from the parameters described above , and for atomic models , the only other input required by the code is the run of density in the ejecta with expansion velocity .",
    "this is known as an explosion model .",
    "the properties of the model determine the appearance of the spectra .",
    "the basic quantities that define an explosion model are the ejected mass and the kinetic energy of the explosion .",
    "in particular , the presence of large amounts of material at high velocities leads to spectra characterized by broad lines @xcite , while , given the same kinetic energy , more massive models have broader light curves @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous fit of the light curve and the spectra of an sn using one explosion model therefore constitutes a validation of the model itself .    because of the spectral similarity with sne 1997ef and 2002ap we started with an explosion model based on co100 , a model characterized by @xmath16@xmath35 and @xmath15@xmath36erg .",
    "model co100 was used to reproduce the light curve and the spectral evolution of sn1997ef , but the very broad lines observed in this sn required the addition of a high - velocity , low - density tail which increased the @xmath15  to @xmath37erg .",
    "the model was also used in rescaled form ( 1/4 of the mass ) to fit the snic 2002ap , which was characterized by broad spectral features but a relatively narrow light curve @xcite .",
    "sn2003bg poses a similar problem . in order to reproduce its narrow light curve we needed to rescale model co100 down in mass",
    "furthermore , line blending in sn2003bg is less extreme than in sne1997ef or 2002ap - it is more similar to sn2006aj : e.g.  the ca  ii  ir triplet and the o  i  7774  line do not blend - and so the density gradient in the outer part must have been steeper .",
    "therefore we did not need the high - velocity tail , and we finally used a model with half the mass of the original co100 .",
    "the model we selected has @xmath16@xmath38 and @xmath15@xmath39erg .    in the spectral models",
    "the luminosity @xmath40 , which is a required input , was determined such as to match the flux in the spectra .",
    "another required input is the photospheric velocity @xmath41 .",
    "this was chosen so that the position of the absorption lines and the overall spectral distribution in the synthetic spectra reproduced the observations as closely as possible . the abundances in the ejecta , also a required input , were chosen to optimize the fit , but our aim was not so much to reproduce the details of the spectra but rather to explain the general evolution of the sn .    because h and he lines appear in the spectra we assumed that these elements are present in the outer part of the ejecta .",
    "he lines are notoriously not visible unless the levels of he  i  are non - thermally excited @xcite .",
    "non - thermal excitation is caused by the fast electrons which are produced in the thermalization process of the @xmath31-rays that are emitted by the radioactive decay of @xmath7ni  into @xmath7co  and hence into @xmath7fe , which is the source of light for sne .",
    "at early times , the density in the ejecta is high and thermalization occurs near the place where the @xmath31-rays are emitted .",
    "since the helium layer is located at a larger radius than the @xmath7ni non - thermal processes do not occur . only at later times",
    "do fast electron begin to travel considerable distances before being thermalized .",
    "in fact , he  i  lines develop rather late in sneib ( e.g.  sn2008d , * ? ? ?",
    "we do not explicitly treat the propagation of the fast electrons , which also requires a detailed mapping of the distribution of @xmath7ni  in what may have been an aspherical explosion .",
    "therefore , the departure coefficients caused by non - thermal processes with respect to the level population computed with our pseudo - nlte treatment are not explicitly computed .",
    "instead , we mimic the effect of overexcitation and ionization caused by non - thermal processes using an arbitrary ` non - thermal factor ' @xmath42 to multiply all he  i  excited level populations",
    ". these factors increase with time , reflecting the increasing penetration of fast electrons in the sn envelope , and they were taken to be similar to those derived by @xcite .",
    "while this is a rough treatment , it gives one at least a feeling for the presence or lack of he in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "a non - thermal factor was also used for hydrogen ( @xmath43 ) : since the h mass must be small , this was required to match the observed line strengths .",
    "the explosion date was chosen to be 2003 february 25 .",
    "this gives a rise time to maximum of @xmath44 days , similar to sn1998bw .",
    "we used a distance modulus of 31.68 ( @xmath45mpc ) , and a very small reddening [ @xmath46 . the early - time spectral fits are presented in figures 1 and 2 and are briefly discussed in the following .",
    "the input values for the spectral models are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the model is shown in figure 1a .",
    "it was computed using @xmath47 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath49 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath50days .",
    "the mass above the photosphere is @xmath51 , and the radiation temperature at the photosphere is @xmath52k .",
    "although he dominates the composition ( 90% by mass above the photospheric velocity ) , and a non - thermal factor @xmath53 was introduced , no strong he lines are visible , and so the he distribution can not be constrained .",
    "hydrogen is present only in a very small amount ( 4% by mass ) . if more h is included , the increased electron density changes the ionization balance of all other species",
    "therefore , the same non - thermal excitation factor as for he  i  was used also for h  i  ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "both h and he lines make only a minor contribution to the troughs near 6000 and 4300 , which are dominated by si  ii  and co  ii  lines , respectively .",
    "other features are due to fe  ii , si  ii , o  i , ca  ii , and mg  ii  and are marked in figure 1a .",
    "the presence of a small amount of material at high velocity ( @xmath55 ) are located at @xmath56 is sufficient to give rise to broad lines .",
    "the model shown in figure 1b was computed with @xmath57 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath58 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath59days .",
    "it is similar to the previous one , but the lines are deeper as the photosphere moved rapidly inwards .",
    "the mass above the photosphere is now @xmath60 .",
    "the abundances are also similar , with he the dominant species .",
    "the higher @xmath40 leads to a higher radiation temperature near the photosphere , @xmath61k .",
    "hydrogen lines now make an important contribution : in the feature near 6200 , h@xmath23  is as strong as si  ii  6355 , which contributes to making that feature broad .",
    "the same non - thermal factors as for feb 28 ( @xmath62 ) were used for both h  i  and he  i. he  i  lines are present in the spectrum .",
    "he  i  5686  is blended with na  i  d , which is however weaker .",
    "the inconsistent strength of h@xmath23 , which is too strong , and h@xmath63 , which is comparable to the observation , may suggest that a full , rather than a parametrized treatment of nlte and non - thermal effects for at least h may be required .",
    "if the contribution of si  ii  6355  to the h@xmath23-si  ii  feature is reduced , the synthetic line does not match the velocity of the observed absorption .",
    "this model is shown in figure 1c .",
    "it was computed with @xmath64 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath65 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath66days .",
    "it has a similar composition as the previous model , and the same non - thermal factors for h  i  and he  i(@xmath62 ) .",
    "as the temperature continues to increase ( now @xmath67k ) with the luminosity , and more mass ( now @xmath68 ) is located above the photosphere , the h and he lines make an increasingly important contribution .",
    "h@xmath23  is now stronger than si  ii  6355 , h@xmath63  is visible , and so are some of the he  i  lines ( especially 4471  and 5876 ) .",
    "apart from this , there are no major differences with respect to the previous spectrum .",
    "this is the spectrum nearest the time of maximum , the epoch of which was not covered .",
    "it was computed with @xmath69 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath70 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath71days , and it is shown in figure 1d .",
    "the spectrum is now bluer than before , but the lines are the same . the temperature has further increased ( @xmath72k ) , and now h  i  and he  i  lines dominate ( the composition is similar to the previous epochs , despite the much larger mass located above the photosphere , @xmath73 , and the same non - thermal factors were used for both h  i  and he  i : @xmath62 ) , while fe makes a smaller contribution by comparison .      this spectrum was obtained after an observational gap near the time of maximum .",
    "it is much redder than all pre - maximum spectra , which is the result of the decrease in temperature ( @xmath74k ) and luminosity .",
    "the model was computed with @xmath75 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath76 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath77days , and it is shown in figure 2a .",
    "the mass above the photosphere is now @xmath78 .",
    "the abundances are not very different , with a slight decrease of he , which is reduced to @xmath79% and replaced mostly by ne near the photospheric layers .",
    "the abundance of fe - group elements has now increased to @xmath80% , which is required to block the near - uv flux .",
    "several he  i  lines are now clearly visible , emphasizing the iib nature of the sn .",
    "they can be reproduced using @xmath81 .",
    "an increase with time of the departure coefficients can be expected because of the increased penetration of the @xmath31-rays , as discussed by .",
    "although any statement about the he mass is made highly uncertain by the presence of the huge non - thermal correction , the strength of the he lines suggests that the he mass should be large . in any case , the he - shell is limited to @xmath82 at most stellar masses in evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "the h  i  lines are now narrower , and have a smaller blueshift than lines of other elements . in order to get a reasonable match to these lines",
    "( only h@xmath23  and h@xmath63  are seen ) it must be assumed that h is present only at @xmath83 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the non - thermal coefficient is only marginally larger than at previous epochs ( @xmath84 ) . given the low abundance of h ( less than 4% ) , we derive a total h mass of @xmath2",
    ". the mass of h can not be much larger for two reasons .",
    "firstly , if the mass was much larger than @xmath85 the star would not be compact and one would expect a type ii light curve , with a phase dominated by h recombination .",
    "secondly , a large h mass would imply a higher electron density , which would then result in a different overall ionization regime and in a worse fit to the spectra .",
    "the oxygen abundance near the photosphere can not be determined because the spectra do not cover the o  i7774  line , so the same value as in the previous epoch was used ( 3% ) .",
    "this spectrum was obtained just a few days later and is similar to the previous one .",
    "the model ( figure 2b ) was computed with @xmath86 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath87 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath88days .",
    "the mass above the photosphere is now @xmath89 , and the temperature has decreased only slightly , to @xmath90k .",
    "the lines are now more clearly separated , with metal lines making a larger contribution to the spectrum , although h@xmath23 , h@xmath63 , and some he lines are still very strong .",
    "the abundances have not changed much .",
    "the non - thermal coefficient for he is larger ( @xmath91 ) , but comparable to what was used in @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal coefficient for h is the same as in the previous epoch ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "h is present only above 9000 km  s@xmath4 , but now a confinement for he has also been introduced at 6500 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this is required to fit the shape and position of the he  i  lines .",
    "the next spectrum is similar to the previous one .",
    "the model ( figure 2c ) was computed with @xmath92 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath93 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath94days , and has a mass above the photosphere of @xmath95 .",
    "the spectrum is marginally cooler than the previous one ( @xmath96k , but the lines that are present are the same . h  i  and he  i  lines are sharp . the abundances have changed consibrably with respect to the previous spectrum .",
    "the abundance of he is down to @xmath97% by mass , and o , ne , and si are highly abundant near the photosphere .",
    "the confinements of h ( above 9000 km  s@xmath4 ) and he ( above 6500 km  s@xmath4 ) are as in the previous spectrum , but the non - thermal factors are higher : @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "departure coefficients that increase with time are expected as @xmath31-rays propagate more efficiently , but the precise values should be tested with realistic calculations .",
    "these require a detailed knowledge of the distribution of @xmath7nias well as of its mass , and are postponed to future work .",
    "still , a slower rise of the non - thermal factor for h  i  than for he  i  may be justified by the fact that hydrogen is located further out than helium in the ejecta , and hence it is more separated from the source of fast electrons . also ,",
    "h  i  levels are separated by smaller energies than those of he  i , and thus are more coupled to the thermal pool .",
    "this also applies to the ionization potentials of the two ions .",
    "this is the last of the photospheric epoch spectra .",
    "the model ( figure 2d ) was computed with @xmath100 [ erg s@xmath4 ] , @xmath41@xmath101 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath102days .",
    "the composition , non - thermal factor and confinements are the same as in the previous spectrum , which was only one day earlier .",
    "the mass above the photosphere is now @xmath103 , and the temperature is @xmath104k .",
    "h  iand he  i  lines are very sharp .",
    "the volume sampled by last few spectra in the photospheric epoch is just outside the volume sampled by the nebular spectra .",
    "the main result of the photospheric - epoch models are that sn2003bg was a very energetic explosion ( a hypernova ) and that h and he are both present , but are clearly confined in velocity : h above 9000 km  s@xmath4  and he above 6500 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this explains the weakness of the h and he lines in the early spectra and the almost complete absence of h in the nebular spectra : these elements are removed from @xmath7ni , the source of the fast particles responsible for non - thermal processes . thus the sn looked like an snic early on , although h and he dominate the composition of the outer ejecta .",
    "this is because the h content should be small ( only @xmath2 ) and the he  i  levels giving rise to the strongest lines are not excited early on .",
    "these levels are excited mostly via non - thermal processes , but the fast particles that are responsible for the excitation are produced deeper in the ejecta , and can not penetrate from the deeper regions when the densities are still too high .",
    "the delayed development of he lines has been observed before in sneib [ e.g.  sn2005bf @xcite ; sn2008d @xcite .",
    "below 6500 km  s@xmath4 , silicon and oxygen dominate the composition , and fe - group elements are also significant .",
    "this behaviour of the h  i  and he  i  lines shows that if h and he are present in the ejecta they will at some point manifest themselves in the spectra .",
    "since in sneic he lines are never seen ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and h lines are not seen in most sneib , these two subtipes must contain very little he and h , respectively .      in order to assess the properties of the inner parts of the ejecta , and thus to determine both the @xmath7ni  mass ( in addition to the light curve results ) and the ejected mass , it is essential that late - phase spectra are modelled as well as early - time ones . at advanced epochs ,",
    "the sn ejecta become optically thin and behave like a nebula .",
    "the gas is heated by the deposition of the @xmath31-rays and positrons that are emitted in the decay of @xmath7co  to @xmath7fe .",
    "collisions of the fast particles that are produced in the thermalization process excite the gas , which is cooled via mostly forbidden - line emission .",
    "the gas conditions are modelled with a non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) code @xcite .",
    "the late - time spectra of sneib / c are dominated by a strong o  i  6300 , 6363  emission line , the shape of which can be used to infer the geometry of the ejecta and our orientation , thanks to the transparency of the nebula @xcite .",
    "we modelled the two latest spectra of sn2003bg , obtained on 2003 dec 16 and 23 , corresponding to fiducial epochs of 293 and 300 days , respectively .",
    "the two spectra are rather similar .",
    "besides o  i  6300 , 6363 , other strong lines are mg  i ] 4570 , several [ fe  ii ] lines which testify to the brightness of the sn , and ca  ii  lines .",
    "the shape of the emission lines does not suggest the presence of strong asymmetries , and the spectra can be modelled assuming a single density and homogeneous abundances below a velocity of 5000 km  s@xmath4 , as indicated by the width of the strongest emission lines ( [ o  i ] , mg  i ] )",
    ". models for the two spectra yield reasonably consistent results ( fig .",
    "3 ) . given the somewhat uncertain flux calibration we take the mean of the results of the two spectral fits .",
    "the spectra can be reproduced assuming an emitting mass of @xmath105 located below a velocity of 5000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the main constituent of the emitting nebula is oxygen ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "other elements are c ( @xmath107 ) , si ( @xmath108 ) , s ( @xmath107 ) , ca ( @xmath109 ) , mg ( @xmath110 ) , and @xmath7ni . the mass of @xmath7ni  in the nebula is @xmath111 , as required by the simultaneous fit of the [ fe  ii ] and other lines . by the time the nebular spectra were observed most @xmath7ni  had decayed to @xmath7co  and @xmath7fe .",
    "the explosion model we used for the early - time models has a mass of @xmath112 below 5000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the result from the nebular spectra is slightly larger , indicating the presence of more mass at low velocities than included in a spherically symmetric explosion model .",
    "this is often seen in sneib / c [ e.g.  sn1994i @xcite ; sn1998bw @xcite ] , and may be the result of some asphericity in the explosion @xcite , which is typical of hne and possibly of all core - collapse sne @xcite . indeed , a hint for the presence of an inner core of material with higher density may be found in the profile of the [ o  i ] 6300 , 6363  line , which may be composed of a main profile characterized by narrowly separated double peaks plus a central core and is reminiscent of that of sn2002ap @xcite .",
    "a model including a density discontinuity to reproduce this profile in detail may have a slightly smaller total mass .",
    "still , the fact that the deviation from parabolic profiles is very small in all lines suggests that any asphericity is small and probably affects only the innermost ejecta .",
    "the strength of the semi - forbidden ca  ii ] 7200  line with respect to the allowed ca  ii  ir triplet suggests that the density was low . in our models ,",
    "the electron density is @xmath113@xmath114 .",
    "a weak , broad [ o  i ] 5557  line may be present in the data , and is only partially reproduced in the synthetic spectra , which also suggests a slightly higher density .",
    "a weak , broad emission to the red of [ o  i ] 6300 , 6363  may be identified as h@xmath23 , as in sn1993j @xcite .      combining the early- and late - time modelling results we find that a model of a highly energetic explosion which ejected @xmath115 of material with @xmath15@xmath1erg can reproduce the observations .",
    "only a small mass of h is present , @xmath2 , located at @xmath116 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "a massive he shell is located at @xmath117 km  s@xmath4 , comprising @xmath118 .",
    "the ejected co core mass is @xmath119 , of which @xmath120 is oxygen .",
    "the rest is mostly carbon ( @xmath121 ) , neon ( @xmath122 ) , silicon ( @xmath123 ) , and sulphur ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the mass of @xmath7ni  is @xmath124 , most of which is located inside of 5000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the confinement of @xmath7nito the lowest velocities explains the late excitation of the he lines .",
    "layers of h and he at the highest ejecta velocities were found by @xcite in most sneib . in sn2003bg and in other sneib the h mass must be larger , so that it gives rise to strong spectral lines . also , in the case of sn2003bg , we find that h extends deeper than in most sneib , similar to the type iib sn1993j @xcite .",
    "the inner distribution of helium is at the lower limit of the @xcite sample .",
    "early on , neither h nor he lines are clearly detected .",
    "an elegant explanation of this behaviour of h was given by @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the case of sn2003bg , the early identification of h lines is rendered difficult by the breadth of the spectral features .",
    "he lines only develop later , as non - thermal excitation increases with time .",
    "the velocity evolution of sn2003bg ( figure 4 ) is similar to that of other sneib / c , in particular the hn sn2002ap , although our estimate of the explosion epoch is uncertain .",
    "it is also similar to sn2008d early on .",
    "the velocities we derived are based on modelling the spectra , and are therefore influenced by trying to reproduce both the overall spectral distribution and the observed line width",
    ". therefore , they are sensitive to the assumed epoch , especially at the earliest phases .",
    "this is an indirect way of assessing the reliability of our choice of epoch .",
    "if the date of explosion was chosen to be earlier than assumed here , the velocity required to fit the spectra would most likely be smaller , and the synthetic lines would be less blended .",
    "a later epoch of explosion , on the other hand , would result in even larger velocities , especially at the earliest times , and the blueshift of the lines would be too large .",
    "we synthesized the bolometric light curve ( lc ) of the ejecta models as constrained by spectral fitting , and compare them to the observed lc , which is described in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "we used the 1-d sn lc code that was originally developed by iwamoto et al .",
    "the code solves the energy and momentum equations of the radiation plus gas in the co - moving frame , and is accurate to first order in @xmath125 .",
    "electron densities and the electron scattering opacity are determined from the saha - boltzmann equation .",
    "the energy deposition from radioactive decays of the newly synthesized @xmath7ni and its daughter @xmath7co is calculated with a gray @xmath31-ray transfer code , assuming an absorptive opacity of @xmath126 @xmath127 g@xmath4 ( swartz , sutherland & harkness 1995 ) .",
    "unlike the sophisticated but time - consuming recipes in the original code , we adopted the approximation proposed by gmez - gomar & isern ( 1996 ) for the eddington factors , and fitted the tops opacities ( magee et al .",
    "1995 ) to find an empirical relationship between the rosseland mean and the electron scattering opacity .",
    "such simplifications were also made by the authors when modeling the lcs of other type ic sne .    the best - fitting model lc shown in fig . 5 ( _ solid line _ ) is characterized by an ejected mass of @xmath128 , with a kinetic energy of @xmath129erg and including @xmath130 of @xmath7ni , whose distribution in the ejecta was adjusted by hand .",
    "the density structure above 5000 km  s@xmath4  was obtained scaling model co100 as constrained by our photospheric - epoch spectral models .",
    "below 5000 km  s@xmath4 , the density was enhanced to the level required by the nebular spectrum modelling . in order to retain the calculation accuracy ,",
    "the ejecta material with @xmath131 was cut out .",
    "this amounts to a negligible mass because of the extremely low density at such high velocities . except for @xmath7ni",
    ", we adopted the abundance distribution of other elements derived from the spectrum synthesis .",
    "in particular , h exists only at @xmath132 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the total h mass is only @xmath133 , which is too small to affect the lc shape by h recombination , = as expected .",
    "the model lc shown has a @xmath7nidistribution of @xmath134 ( or @xmath135 in mass fraction ) between 10,000 and 20,000 km  s@xmath4 , @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) between 5,000 and 10,000 km  s@xmath4 , @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) between 3,000 and 5,000 km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) below 3,000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "thus the total @xmath7nimass derived from the light curve ( @xmath130 is similar to that obtained from the spectral fits , but the distribution is different .",
    "the light curve model requires more @xmath7ni  at high velocities .    for comparison , two other model lcs with different model parameters",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "the _ dashed line _ shows a lc obtained with the same density structure and hence the same mass and kinetic energy as the best - fit lc , but with the @xmath7ni  distribution derived from the spectrum modelling .",
    "the total @xmath7ni mass is then @xmath140 , of which @xmath111 are located below 5000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this low - velocity @xmath7ni  must be responsible for the high peak and post - peak flux , which is above the early - time photometry by @xmath141mag , although the lc matches the very late photometry , as it should by design , since the inner distribution of @xmath7ni  was obtained from fitting the nebular spectra .",
    "moreover , there are only @xmath142 of @xmath7ni above 10,000 km  s@xmath4 , not enough to power a very fast early lc rise .",
    "the _ dotted line _ is the synthesized lc of a model without the density enhancement below 5000 km  s@xmath4  and with the @xmath7ni  distribution constrained by spectral modeling .",
    "the total ejecta mass , kinetic energy , and @xmath7ni  mass are @xmath143 , @xmath144erg , and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "although the energy available is smaller , the lc peak is actually as as bright as in the other models because less ejecta material is heated .",
    "however , because of the small ejecta mass relative to the kinetic energy , the lc peak is too narrow and the lc drops too rapidly when compared to the observations . as a further test of our model , we plot in the _ inset _ of fig .",
    "5 the evolution of the photospheric velocity of the three models as estimated approximately by the lc code .",
    "they all reproduce well the values that were determined by spectral modeling ( _ stars _ ) .",
    "while we can not exclude the possibility that other @xmath7ni  distributions , with some tuning , may also give a good lc fit , it would be a futile attempt to try to pin down the @xmath7ni distribution so precisely in a one - dimensional model . nonetheless , the distribution we adopted results in a rapid lc rise , and in a maximum luminosity and a broad lc peak that match the observations well .",
    "after about day 150 the model lc lies below the observations by @xmath146mag , but the slope is comparable .",
    "the properties of sn2003bg derived from our analysis suggest that the sn was the explosion of a massive star , clearly more massive than the type iib sn1993j .",
    "the large explosion energy ( @xmath15@xmath1erg ) qualifies sn2003bg as a hypernova , in line with the broad lines detected in the earliest spectra .",
    "if the ejected mass was @xmath115 , of which @xmath118 were he and only @xmath2 was h , the star had lost only its h envelope . assuming that the compact object formed at the time of core - collapse had a mass between @xmath147 ( if it was a neutron star ) and @xmath148 ( if it was a black hole ) , we have a he star of @xmath149 at explosion .",
    "this would imply a co core of @xmath115 and a star of main - sequence mass @xmath150 , very similar to the star that exploded as sn2002ap @xcite and also similar to , or perhaps somewhat less massive than the progenitor of the xrf - sn2008d @xcite .",
    "sn2003bg had a similar explosion energy as these two other sne , but because of the larger @xmath16  very high velocities were not reached , and spectral lines were not as broad .",
    "this situation ( low velocities , larger overlying mass ) also would have made the generation of a hard x - ray or @xmath31-ray transient very unlikely .",
    "the @xmath7ni  distribution derived from the light curve model is different from that obtained from the spectra .",
    "most of the @xmath7ni  obtained from the spectral models is required to power the nebular spectra . if a higher abundance of @xmath7niwas used outside of the 5000 km  s@xmath4  zone sampled by the nebular spectra , the synthetic [ o  i]6300  line would be too broad , unless @xmath7ni  and oxygen were physically separated .",
    "this would be a signature of asymmetry in the explosion , as was seen in , e.g.  , sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "sn2003bg falls on the relations between stellar main sequence mass and , respectively , mass of @xmath7ni  synthesised and @xmath15  produced in the explosion @xcite , as shown in figures 6 and 7 , suggesting that these relations hold not only for sneic but also for less stripped core - collapse sne .",
    "given our estimate of the progenitor mass , the compact remnant is likely to have been a black hole , but it also could have have been a neutron star .",
    "overenergetic explosions are expected also in this case if the neutron star is a magnetar @xcite .    however , the presence of significant csm gave rise to strong radio emission in sn2003bg @xcite .",
    "what is the difference between sn2003bg and sn2006aj ?",
    "sn2006aj had lost its he envelope , and possibly part of its co core .",
    "thus the circumstellar material inside of which sn2006aj exploded was composed mostly of oxygen @xcite sn2003bg only lost most of its h envelope , and h was the main constituent of the csm @xcite .",
    "quite possibly , sn2006aj was a binary star , which helped ejecting the envelope .",
    "sn2003bg may have been a single star , and if it was an interacting binary the effect of interaction was not as dramatic as in sn2006aj .",
