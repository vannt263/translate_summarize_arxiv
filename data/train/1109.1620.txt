    "the @xmath0-dibaryon , predicted by r.  l.  jaffe in 34 years ago  @xcite .",
    "is one of most famous candidates of exotic - hadron .",
    "this prediction was based on the observations that the quark exclusion can be completely avoided due to the essentially flavor - singlet(@xmath3 ) nature of @xmath0-dibaryon , together with the large attraction from one - gluon - exchange interaction between quarks suggested in the quark model  @xcite .",
    "search for the @xmath0-dibaryon is one of the most challenging theoretical and experimental problems in the physics of strong interaction and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "still it is not clear whether there exists the @xmath0-dibaryon in nature .",
    "although deeply bound @xmath0-dibaryon with the binding energy @xmath4 mev from the @xmath5 threshold has been ruled out by the discovery of the double @xmath6 hypernuclei , @xmath7he  @xcite , there still remains a possibility of a shallow bound state or a resonance in this channel  @xcite .",
    "several lattice qcd calculations on @xmath0 have been reported as reviewed in  @xcite ( see also recent works @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a serious problem in studying dibaryons on the lattice : to accommodate two baryons inside the lattice volume , the spatial lattice size @xmath8 should be large enough .",
    "once @xmath8 becomes large , however , energy levels of two baryons become dense , so that isolation of the ground state from the excited states is very difficult ( quite a large imaginary - time @xmath9 is required ) .",
    "all the previous works on dibaryons more or less face this issue . in this paper , we employ our original approach distinct from one in previous studies , and search the @xmath0-dibaryon in lattice qcd  @xcite . because the flavor @xmath1 breaking complicate calculation , we start with the flavor @xmath1 limit .",
    "to study interaction or property of a hadron systems in lattice qcd , we utilize the nambu - bethe - salpeter ( nbs ) wave function and the corresponding potential , instead of the energy eigenstate . within the non - relativistic approximation ,",
    "potential of a two - body interaction can be defined from the nbs wave function @xmath10 through the schrdinger equation in the euclidean space - time @xcite , @xmath11 \\psi(\\vec r , t )      + \\int \\!\\ !",
    "d^3 \\vec r ' \\ , u(\\vec r , \\vec r ' ) \\ , \\psi(\\vec r ' , t )       = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } \\psi(\\vec r , t)\\ ] ] where a non - local but energy - independent potential @xmath12 is introduced , and @xmath13 is the reduced mass of the system with masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the potential @xmath12 can be determined by solving this equation by using data of @xmath10 measured on the lattice . since",
    "only a single data of @xmath10 is available from one simulation , we can not construct whole the potential @xmath12 , but can obtain the leading term of the velocity expansion of it .",
    "we describe the potential @xmath16 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one obtains a sink - time independent @xmath16 even without isolating energy eigenstates .",
    "it is also shown that we can obtain a volume independent @xmath16 , if we setup the volume larger than the minimum to accommodate the interaction , e.g. @xmath17 fm for the nucleon - nucleon interaction at @xmath18 mev .",
    "once we obtain a volume independent potential , any observable of the system , such as binding energy and scattering phase shift , can be obtained by solving the schrdinger equation in the infinite volume .",
    "note that , in contrast to the conventional lscher s method @xcite , we do not calculate the energy shift of two hadrons at finite @xmath8 to access the observables in the infinite volume .",
    "finally , the nbs wave function can be obtained by summing up the hadron four - pint function @xmath19 which can be evaluated numerically in lattice qcd .",
    ".[tbl : lattice]summary of lattice parameters and hadron masses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for dynamical lattice qcd simulations , we have generated five ensembles of gauge configuration on @xmath20 lattice . we have employed the renormalization group improved iwasaki gauge action with the coupling constant @xmath21 , and the non - perturbatively @xmath22 improved wilson quark action .",
    "quark propagators are calculated for the quark wall source with the dirichlet boundary condition in the temporal direction . the point type octet - baryon field operators are used at sink .",
    "the sink @xmath2 operator is projected to the @xmath23 representation of the cubic group , so that the nbs wave function is dominated by the s - wave component . for the time derivative of the nbs wave function",
    ", we adopt the symmetric difference on the lattice . to enhance signal over noise , we average 16 measurements for each configuration , together with the average between forward and backward propagation in time .",
    "statistical errors are evaluated by the jackknife method .",
    "lattice parameters such as lattice spacing @xmath24 , lattice size @xmath8 , the hopping parameter @xmath25 , the number of gauge configurations @xmath26 , together with the hadron masses are summarized in table [ tbl : lattice ] .",
    "the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] shows the flavor - singlet @xmath2 potential at each quark mass , extracted from our numerical simulation of full qcd .",
    "one see that it has an  attractive core \" and its range is well localized in space .",
    "this entirely attractive potential prove that the quark model prediction to the flavor - singlet @xmath2 channel is essentially correct .",
    "one can see that the long range part of the attraction tends to increase as the quark mass decreases .    by solving the schrdinger equation involving this potential",
    ", we can obtain any information of the system , for instance , energy of the ground state .",
    "it turns out that there is only one bound state in each quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] shows the energy and the root - mean - square ( rms ) distance of the bound state .",
    "the result for @xmath27 mev is only preliminary because of insufficient number of independent gauge configuration .",
    "these bound state correspond to the @xmath0-dibaryon predicted by jaffe .",
    "our lattice qcd calculation shows that a stable @xmath0-dibaryon certainly exists in the flavor @xmath1 limit world with the binding energy of 2050 mev for the present quark masses . despite",
    "that the attractive potential become stronger as quark mass decreases , the resultant binding energies of the @xmath0-dibaryon decrees in the present range of the quark masses .",
    "this is due to the fact that the increase of the attraction toward the lighter quark mass is compensated by the increase of the kinetic energy for the lighter baryon mass .",
    "the rms distance @xmath28 is a measure of spacial distribution of baryonic matter in the @xmath0-dibaryon , which can be compared to the point matter rms distance of the deuteron in nature , @xmath29 fm .",
    "one may be able to get feeling of the @xmath0-dibaryon from this comparison : @xmath0-dibaryon is much compact compared to usual nuclei .",
    "when we solve the schrdinger equation , we use the potential expressed in terms of an analytic function fitted to the data .",
    "error from the choice for the analytic function to fit is negligible ( less than few % ) .",
    "small systematic error arise from choice for the sink - time - slice .",
    "the final result of the binding energy of the @xmath0-dibaryon in the @xmath1 limit described as @xmath30 becomes , for example , @xmath31 with statistical error ( first ) and systematic error ( second ) .",
    "one may think such a deeply bound @xmath0-dibaryon is ridiculous or ruled out by the discovery of the double @xmath6 nuclei .",
    "the present @xmath32 should be interpreted as the binding energy from the @xmath2 threshold averaged in the @xmath33 sector .",
    "the three @xmath2 thresholds in this sector split largely in the real world with the flavor @xmath1 breaking .",
    "therefore , we expect that the binding energy of the @xmath0-dibaryon in the real world , measured from the @xmath5 threshold , is much smaller than the present value or even @xmath0-dibaryon goes to above the @xmath5 threshold . to make a definite conclusion on this point , however , we need ( 2 + 1)-flavor lattice qcd simulations and the analysis in @xmath34 coupled channel .",
    "study along this direction is in progress  @xcite .",
