    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been successful in describing the fundamental particles of our world and is currently in good agreement with almost all the experimental results .",
    "however , under closer scrutiny the sm reveals that there are well motivated reasons for expecting new physics ( np ) .",
    "the most discussed topic in the area of theoretical shortcomings of the sm is the so - called hierarchy problem . in a nut - shell ,",
    "the problem is that the sm fails to explain why the higgs mass is light ( electroweak scale ) , while calculations within the sm framework allow it to grow indefinitely to planck scales .",
    "many theoretical frameworks were proposed to take into account and resolve the hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetry and extra dimensional models are the most studied scenarios in the literature . in this analysis",
    ", we will work in the context of randall  sundrum ( rs ) warped extra dimensional model .",
    "the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem in the context of extra dimensions , earlier suggested by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add )  @xcite allowed only gravity to access the extra dimension(s ) .",
    "the add scenario explained the weakness of the gravity compared to other forces by the fact that gravity becomes diluted in the volume of large extra dimensions .",
    "however , this scenario transferred the gauge hierarchy problem onto the problem of the discrepancy between the large size of extra dimensions , r @xmath7 1 mm ( fixed from experimental constraints ) and the natural value of r @xmath7 10@xmath8 cm .",
    "an ambitious proposal to the hierarchy problem was then put forward by randall and sundrum . in the original rs model  @xcite , there are two 3-branes embedded in the 5-dimensional(5-d ) anti - de sitter ( ads ) space , with all the sm particles localized on the visible 3-brane , and only the graviton propagating in the bulk .",
    "this model offers a simple and natural solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the separation between the two 3-branes leads directly to the existence of an additional scalar called the radion , corresponding to the quantum fluctuations of the distance between the two 3-branes .",
    "the radion is massless in the limit of the backreaction going to zero , but acquires a mass with a suitable stabilizing mechanism @xcite .",
    "the radion can be much lighter than the massive gravitons . for different phenomenological studies , the mass of the radion @xmath9 is usually considered in the range of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the radion couples with the matter via the trace of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "thus , the structure of the coupling of the radion with the sm fields is similar to that of the higgs boson .",
    "however , for massless gauge bosons , there is an enhancement coming from the trace anomaly term .",
    "general covariance allows a possibility of mixing between the radion and the higgs boson .",
    "the dedicated analysis of the higgs sector at the lhc will help in constraining the higgs - radion mixing hypotheses .",
    "the phenomenology of the higgs - radion mixed sector has been studied thoroughly in the literature in the context of the electroweak precision measurements and using the higgs results from the lhc  @xcite .    in an effort to improve the predictions of the model , and to render it suitable for phenomenology",
    ", the rs model was modified allowing the gauge bosons to propagate in the bulk , so as to facilitate the gauge coupling unification  @xcite .",
    "allowing the gauge bosons in the bulk in turn introduces towers of gauge kaluza - klein(kk ) states on the tev brane .",
    "the sm fermions and the higgs , localized on the tev brane , couple maximally to these kk gauge states , leading to large corrections to the peskin - takeuchi ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) parameters , respectively .",
    "this in turn leads to strong constraints on the 5-d theory from the electroweak precision observables .",
    "the bounds on the kk masses are of the order of 30 tev  @xcite in the models with only the sm gauge bosons and the gravitons in the bulk . putting the sm fermions in the bulk along with the massive sm gauge bosons",
    "solves the flavor violation problems of the theory @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson is localized on the ir brane in this modified model , to account for the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "this approach naturally explains the hierarchy problem in the yukawa sector , with the fermions being localized at different points in the bulk .",
    "localizing lighter fermions nearer to the planck brane , with the top and the higgs localized on the ir brane , leads to weakening of constraints on the kk gauge states from the oblique @xmath11 parameter .",
    "however the strong constraints from the @xmath12 parameter still persist  @xcite , with the electroweak precision results imposing a bound of around 10 tev on the mass of lightest spin one resonances .",
    "this strong constraint from @xmath12 parameter in these 5d warped bulk scenarios can be mitigated by various methods , discussed in  @xcite .",
    "one of the possible cures for the increased @xmath12 parameter is to extend the symmetry of the model to the custodial @xmath13 symmetry , first discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the bulk gauge symmetry in this case is @xmath14 .",
    "the tree - level @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameters in this scenario are well behaved , with the @xmath12 parameter likely to vanish and the constraints mainly coming from the @xmath11 parameter .",
    "this in turn leads into a lower bound of about 6 tev on the first kk mode of the gauge bosons .",
    "the second possible solution which limits the masses of the first kk gauge bosons to the order of 5 tev , are the ones with large brane localized kinetic terms for the gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "the third possibility is in the form of the models with deformed metric  @xcite . in this framework",
    "the sm particles , including the higgs , are in the bulk , the space departs from ads@xmath15 near the ir brane , while being similar to rs near the uv brane . in these scenarios",
    "kk gauge boson modes as low as 1 - 2 tev can be consistent with the electroweak precision tests , for a suitable choice of model parameters .",
    "recent works discussing the bounds on the lightest kk gauge boson , in the context of the above scenarios , with up to date electroweak fits are in  @xcite .",
    "here we choose to work in the framework of custodial rs model and concentrate on the phenomenological aspect of the higgs - radion mixing , where all the sm particles except the higgs bosons are in the bulk .",
    "the fermions are allowed to be localized anywhere in the bulk , leading to the natural generation of the yukawa coupling hierarchies .",
    "the fermion masses depend on the bulk mass parameters @xmath16 ( for the doublets ) and @xmath17 ( for right - handed fields ) characterizing the profiles of the zero mode fermions .",
    "the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are fixed depending on the wavefunction of the fermion on the planck brane or the tev brane .",
    "they are chosen to match the fermion mass hierarchy fixed through the physical quark masses and mixing at the weak scale .",
    "the custodial rs model , compared to the original rs model , predicts the existence of 5 additional gauge bosons , 3 of which are neutral and 2 of which are charged .",
    "the coupling of the radion with the sm gauge bosons ( massive and massless ) in custodial rs model is similar to the non - custodial case .",
    "the top quark being heavy ( localized on the tev brane like the new kk modes ) couples strongly to the new heavy gauge bosons .",
    "the bottom quark ( @xmath18 ) being in the same electroweak doublet as @xmath19 is also affected , and in turn modifies the @xmath20 coupling , which must be in accordance with the sm prediction at 0.25% level .",
    "this calls for adjusting the profiles for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so as to protect the @xmath23 coupling .",
    "there are many analyses which have looked into different fermion representations , with the custodial symmetry protecting @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "these scenarios consider the first two generations of the quarks and the leptons as doublets under the @xmath24 . the third generation",
    "left - handed quarks are in the doublet representation of both @xmath24 and @xmath13 , which leads to non - sm fermions with no zero modes .",
    "these fermions are very heavy and therefore not relevant for our analysis . in order to accommodate the large top and bottom mass difference",
    ", @xmath22 can be either in a singlet or in a triplet representation of @xmath13 ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "overall the top and the bottom quark can have various possible quantum numbers and profiles in the extra dimension , so as to satisfy the constraints from flavor violation and precision tests .",
    "different possibilities include the localization of @xmath22 very close to the tev brane with @xmath21 having a profile close to flat , or the contrary case with @xmath21 very close to the tev brane and @xmath22 close to flat .",
    "the intermediate case with the profile of @xmath21 and @xmath22 being near , but not close to the tev brane is also possible .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the electroweak fits favor a close to flat profile for @xmath21 , with @xmath22 peaked near the tev brane .",
    "therefore we consider this case , with @xmath25 = 0.4 - 0.3 and @xmath26 = 0 .",
    "all the other fermions including @xmath27 , are assumed to be localized on or very near the planck brane , with @xmath28 .",
    "the specific choice of representations of the third generation quarks will not affect our results for @xmath29 final states , while the values for @xmath25 and @xmath30 would influence the analysis in the @xmath31 final state , but not by more than @xmath32 factor .    within the present scenario , with the latest constraints coming from the lhc 8 tev results",
    ", it is worthwhile to study the current status of the higgs - radion mixing . as an artifact of the trace anomaly , the production of the radion at the lhc proceeds dominantly through the gluon fusion .",
    "the radion can also be produced through vector boson fusion as well as in association with a single massive gauge boson or @xmath33 pair .",
    "once produced , it can decay to a pair of gluon , photon or @xmath31 final state with sizable cross section .",
    "the decay to a pair of massive gauge bosons as well as a pair of higgs bosons , if kinematically allowed , can also be observed in the lhc .",
    "one can observe a light radion at the lhc in the diphoton channel  @xcite . in the presence of the higgs - radion mixing ,",
    "the coupling of both the scalars to the sm particle is altered .",
    "there exists a particular value of mixing , where one of the scalars couples maximally to the gluon and the photon , and almost decouples from the massive sm particles .",
    "as will be discussed later , the parameter space involving the scenario of the higgs mixed with the radion mostly is restricted by the current lhc bounds coming from the heavy scalar searches in the @xmath4 and the @xmath34 channel .",
    "therefore only this particular value of mixing , which can only be probed through the diphoton final state , is still allowed .",
    "we first perform a comprehensive analysis of this region of the parameter space ( where the radion only couples to the gluon and the photon ) , for the case of both 13 and 14 tev lhc , with the radion mass varying from 80 gev @xmath1 1 tev .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath34 decay modes dominate over most of the mixing parameter space , once kinematically allowed .",
    "the hadronic decay channels of these gauge bosons are difficult to observe at the lhc .",
    "we therefore repeat our analysis with the radion being produced through gluon fusion , and decaying to @xmath34 , with the @xmath3 decaying leptonically .",
    "we do not consider the @xmath35 decay channel , because the leptonic decay of @xmath35 is accompanied by missing energy , making it difficult for the scalar mass reconstruction .",
    "the mixed radion can also be produced at the lhc via vector boson fusion , but the production rate are suppressed by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the radion .",
    "the proposed international linear collider(ilc )  @xcite will be the next generation @xmath36 collider , designed to operate at the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energies of 250 , 500 and 1000 gev , with integrated luminosity of 250 fb@xmath2 , 500 fb@xmath2 , and 1000 fb@xmath2 , respectively . compared to the lhc , the leptonic linear collider has moderate hadronic backgrounds and a tunable but restricted centre of mass energy .",
    "the ilc is mainly intended for precision measurements of the masses and couplings of the sm particles .",
    "therefore if there is any evidence of new physics at the lhc , a thorough precision study in the ilc will be necessary to pinpoint the validity of the new scenario .",
    "the ilc will also has the additional advantage of initial beam polarization , both longitudinal and transverse ( 60% for @xmath37 and 90% for @xmath38 ) . at the ilc , the direct search for the radion @xmath39 can be via @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with the radion decaying to either @xmath31 or @xmath42 .",
    "the analysis through these decay channels will help the ilc to probe those regions of the parameter space which will be difficult to explore at the lhc .",
    "we have therefore also performed a through analysis , for radion of mass in the range 100 gev @xmath1 1 tev , in case of ilc , considering the above production channels .",
    "the @xmath31 and the hadronic decay channel of the @xmath35 are considered .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to show the synergy of the lhc and the ilc in exploring the higgs - radion mixed scenario , in the context of warped model with custodial symmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the original version of the rs model has one extra dimension , compactified on a circle .",
    "this compactification has a topology of @xmath43 orbifold , where @xmath44 is a sphere in one dimension and @xmath45 is the multiplicative group @xmath46 . by construction ,",
    "the final picture is of two 3-branes , separated by a distance and enclosing a 5d bulk .",
    "the branes are located at the orbifold fixed points , with @xmath47 = 0 , @xmath48 .",
    "the two branes are required to have opposite tensions , which cancel the 5d bulk cosmological constant to yield a vanishing 4d cosmological constant .",
    "these 3-branes support the 3 + 1 dimensional theory and are called the visible ( tev ) and the hidden ( planck ) branes .",
    "the fundamental action describing the above part , excluding the 3-branes , is @xmath49 -\\lambda),\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the determinant of the five - dimensional metric , @xmath51 is the fundamental 5d mass scale , @xmath52 is the ricci scalar and @xmath53 is the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the 5-d metric , respecting the four - dimensional poincare invariance in the @xmath54 direction , takes the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 the compactification radius and @xmath57 the bulk curvature .",
    "as mentioned before , in the original rs model , the sm particles are localized on the brane .",
    "therefore the four dimensional effective action is obtained by integrating out the extra dimension .",
    "all the fields have initially masses near the 4d planck scale , and the fundamental mass parameter is exponentially suppressed , as @xmath58 , with the physical mass being warped down to the weak scale . since @xmath59 , the size of the extra dimension is given by @xmath60 . the compactification radius , @xmath61 is arbitrary and is treated as a free parameter in the theory .",
    "it can be considered as a fluctuation in the extra dimension , which results to the existence of a massless scalar field called the radion .",
    "goldberger and wise  @xcite proposed an interesting solution to fix the size of extra dimension by introducing a massive scalar field in the bulk with an associated potential , along with interaction terms on the two 3-branes .",
    "taking into account the backreaction of the geometry due to the scalar field , an effective potential is generated , which stabilizes the compactified radius .",
    "this effective potential generates mass and vev of the radion .",
    "the 5-d metric is then subsequently expanded taking into account the scalar perturbations @xmath62 due to the effect of the radion field .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath65 is determined by requiring that the metric solves einstein s equations , whereas @xmath66 is the canonically normalized 4d scalar field obtained after integrating out the extra dimension . when the backreaction of the metric background due to the scalar field is small , the wavefunction is then @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the vev of the radion .",
    "the mass of the radion depends on the mass of the bulk scalar and can be smaller than 1 tev . as the other kk fluctuations lie in the scale of at least 2 - 3 tev ,",
    "the radion is the lightest scalar in this scenario that can be detected directly at the lhc .",
    "the model considered here is the 5d electroweak group incorporated in a custodial @xmath69 symmetry .",
    "the gauge group in the bulk is @xmath70 , with the breaking of @xmath71 on the tev brane , and @xmath72 on the planck brane . in this picture , the matter and the gauge fields propagate in the bulk .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking on the tev brane is achieved via a localized higgs as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the zero modes of the bulk fields are identified with the sm particles .",
    "the fermions are assumed to be localized near the planck brane , for @xmath28 , and near the ir brane for @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the flavor index . in order to generate the yukawa couplings hierarchy ,",
    "lighter fermions are assumed to be localized near planck brane and @xmath75 are close to ir brane .",
    "assuming that the yukawa coupling matrix is diagonal , the electron yukawa coupling leads to @xmath76 and the top yukawa coupling constrains @xmath77 .",
    "therefore for the remaining fermions the corresponding yukawa couplings are obtained for @xmath78  @xcite . in our analysis , the @xmath79 for all the fermions except the bottom and the top quark are fixed such that the coupling of the radion to the fermions is similar to the sm yukawa coupling ( @xmath80 ) , that is , with the couplings being proportional to the mass of the fermions .",
    "the only difference arises from the fact that the couplings with the radion are suppressed by @xmath81 ( the radion vev ) instead of @xmath82 ( the higgs vev ) . for the bottom quark , the profile parameters as discussed before are @xmath83 = 0.3 and @xmath84 .",
    "similarly for the top quark we have @xmath85 = 0.3 and @xmath26 = 0 .",
    "the interaction with fermions is then , for the higgs and the radion @xmath86 where @xmath87 for all the fermions except the @xmath88 and @xmath89 quark .",
    "the radion coupling to the gauge bosons differs from the coupling of the gauge bosons to the higgs .",
    "we first discuss the couplings to massive gauge bosons , where in the case of the sm higgs the coupling is proportional to the mass . in case of the radion , due to the propagation of the gauge bosons in the bulk",
    ", there is an additional tree level coupling of the radion to the bulk kinetic term of the massive gauge bosons .",
    "this additional tree level coupling is also present for the massless gauge bosons propagating in the bulk .",
