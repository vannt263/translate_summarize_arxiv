    "the space interferometry mission ( sim ) will perform astrometry with unprecedented precision , measuring positions at the microarcsecond level .",
    "this will allow numerous astrophysical experiments to be performed that previously were impossible .",
    "even though its 10 meter baseline allows resolution only of @xmath0 mas , sim achieves microarcsecond astrometric precision by centroiding fringes to better than 1 part in a thousand .",
    "if sim can meet its technical specifications , the primary source of error for single star astrometry would be photon noise , which can be beat down as @xmath1 until the systematic error floor is reached . for multiple stars in the field of view , however , other errors may be incurred .",
    "for example , the extra flux of photons from field sources gives additional photon noise , which increases the amount of on - source integration time to achieve a given astrometric precision .",
    "another source of error , which can not be reduced by further integration time , is the distortion in the measured fringe pattern caused by the superposition of fringes from multiple incoherent sources .",
    "since sim achieves its revolutionary precision by fitting the observed fringe pattern in exquisite detail , even small scale deviations from the single star fringe pattern can lead to large astrometric errors .",
    "several possible sim experiments , such as microlensing , globular cluster dynamics , or stellar motions in external galaxies like m31 , require sim astrometry in crowded fields , and so it is necessary to determine whether or not crowding will corrupt sim measurements irretrievably .",
    "one might imagine that sim astrometry of targets many magnitudes brighter than other sources in the field of view  would be unaffected by the presence of those sources .",
    "however , @xcite have recently shown that source confusion in crowded fields can lead to significant errors ( @xmath2 few @xmath3as ) in individual position measurements , even when the confusing field sources are just a few percent of the target s brightness .",
    "such errors are comparable to those expected from photon noise and systematic error , and could pose a serious threat to astrometric measurements in crowded fields if uncorrected .",
    "brighter sources , such as binary companions or highly luminous field stars @xmath4 in brightness , could completely destroy sim astrometry . to correct these measurements , one would like to know the positions and brightnesses of all the important sources in the field of view   that is , one would like an image .",
    "a possibility is to obtain , prior to sim observations , either space telescope or ground based adaptive optics ( ao ) snapshots of the field .",
    "unfortunately , as we show below , the rough positions obtainable ( @xmath5 mas ) from such images are of insufficient precision to rectify sim astrometry .",
    "another alternative is to perform synthesis imaging with sim . in analogy to radio interferometry , one might orient sim along numerous baselines , using multiple siderostat pairs to fill in the @xmath6 plane @xcite .",
    "note , however , that a possible sim design currently under consideration involves just one 10 meter baseline .",
    "a third alternative , which we discuss here , is to use sim in its astrometry mode .",
    "if the sources all lie several fringes away from each other then the @xmath6 coverage obtained from just two baselines , using multiple frequency channels , is sufficient to disentangle the sources from each other and measure all of their positions to few @xmath3as precision .",
    "this is a marked increase in astrometric precision relative to that possible from sim imaging , @xmath7as @xcite , and thus allows significantly improved proper motion measurements .",
    "we show that , for the currently expected characteristics of the sim satellite , and for typical levels of crowding in the lmc , bulge , and the outer regions of globular clusters , these two orthogonal baselines are adequate to achieve excellent astrometric or proper motion precision .",
    "note that similar ideas have been used previously in simulations of closure phase measurements @xcite and in visibility measurements of the binary star capella @xcite .    to see why just two baselines are sufficient , consider a synthesis imaging measurement of several point sources .",
    "this involves measuring the complex visibility @xmath8 at numerous points in the @xmath6 plane , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are spatial frequencies , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the projections of the baseline separation along the @xmath13 axes respectively .",
    "the visibility @xmath14 and brightness distribution @xmath15 are related by fourier transformation , e.g. @xmath16)$ ] , via the van cittert - zernike theorem ( see for example * ? ? ? * chapter 2 ) . for an arbitrary brightness distribution @xmath15",
    "sufficiently many @xmath17 points must be sampled to permit accurate fourier inversion of the visibility .",
    "a typical astrometry measurement relies upon just two baseline orientations , which would appear insufficient to localize more than one source position ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 coordinates ) .",
    "note , however , that each frequency channel at a given baseline orientation constitutes an independent @xmath17 measurement , since @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the multifrequency @xmath17 coverage from two orthogonal sim baselines is limited to points on the @xmath17 axes ( see figure [ uv ] ) , and is clearly insufficient to reconstruct an arbitrary brightness distribution . for _ point sources _ , on the other hand , this coverage suffices . consider @xmath22 corresponding to a sum of point sources , each with spectrum @xmath23 . taking for now each @xmath24 independent of @xmath25 gives the measured visibility as @xmath26)$ ] .",
    "now , instead of the usual 2d fourier transform to recover the brightness distribution , consider a single 1d fourier transform , say along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "this gives @xmath28 , and similarly for the 1d transform along the @xmath29 direction .",
    "clearly , the sources @xmath18 coordinates are measurable just by sampling the visibility at multiple @xmath27 along a line of constant @xmath29 , and similarly for the @xmath19 positions . by placing each source on a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) using the @xmath23 ,",
    "the @xmath18 sources can be matched up with the @xmath19 sources , giving the unique 2d coordinates of each bright source in the field @xcite .",
    "if the pairing is not obvious from the cmd , then a third baseline orientation is required to match up the @xmath18 and @xmath19 sources , but note that this need be done only once , at any time . in theory , therefore , the two orthogonal sim baselines required to perform single source astrometry are all that are necessary to perform imaging of point sources . in practice , finite bandwidth , nyquist sampling and photon noise will limit point source resolution .",
    "we explore these effects in the next section .",
    "coverage for ( a ) synthesis imaging with many baseline orientations , ( b ) astrometry with two baseline orientations , and ( c ) astrometry with two baselines and channeled spectrum .",
    "only half of the @xmath6 plane is illustrated since the brightness distribution is real ; redundant points are not plotted .",
    "[ uv],scaledwidth=43.0% ]",
    "the above procedure of fourier transforming along the @xmath27 or @xmath29 direction is equivalent to taking the spectrally dispersed 1d fringe pattern for each orthogonal baseline orientation , and fourier transforming with respect to frequency @xmath25 .",
    "this is the same procedure that is often used for single source phase and group delay estimation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) .",
    "let @xmath30 equal the product of source spectrum , throughput , and detector response .",
    "note that since ccd s count numbers of photons , not power , @xmath31 has units of numbers .",
    "the interferometer response at frequency @xmath25 to a source offset from the phase center by an angle @xmath32 along the baseline @xmath33 is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the physical delay .",
    "fourier transforming with respect to @xmath25 gives @xmath36/4 $ ] , with @xmath37 the fourier conjugate to @xmath25 and @xmath38 the fourier transform of @xmath30 .",
    "in most cases , @xmath30 is slowly varying , and so its fourier transform has power mainly at low frequencies .",
    "for example , for @xmath30=const , @xmath39 and the fourier transform of the fringe pattern becomes @xmath40/4 $ ] .",
    "likewise , for a rectangular bandpass , we would have a sinc function .",
    "for simplicity , we will focus on rectangular @xmath30 , although the generalization is clear .",
    "as expected , each source in the field of view  appears as a narrow peak in the fourier transform space ( actually a pair since the brightness is a real quantity ) .",
    "also note that half of the power lies at zero frequency , due to the 1/2 which offsets the average fringe intensity from zero .",
    "figure [ crosses ] illustrates the pattern for two point sources .",
    "now , assume that sim uses @xmath41 frequency channels . for simplicity , we take each channel to have the same frequency width .",
    "this assumption allows the use of the fft , otherwise a more general discrete fourier transform or lomb - scargle periodogram would be used . with this assumption",
    ", the nyquist theorem tells us that each bin in fourier space has a size equaling the white - light coherence envelope size @xmath42 $ ] which for a rectangular @xmath43 m bandpass and 10 meter baseline is roughly 13.75 mas .",
    "this makes sense , since sim should be able to resolve sources separated by more than one coherence envelope size .",
    "clearly , decreasing the effective bandwidth should diminish sim s ability to resolve point sources . varying",
    "the number of channels should affect only aliasing . with fewer , broader channels ,",
    "a source near the edge of the field of view  has reduced fringe contrast and would be mistaken for the combination of a fainter source near the middle of the fov and uniform surface brightness .",
    "this could corrupt astrometric measurements of sources towards the edge of the field of view .",
    "we have simulated sim astrometric measurements of crowded fields with the above considerations .",
    "we assume that sim scans repeatedly over a small range in delay , corresponding to the central fringe size at the mean frequency , which for a 10 m baseline and @xmath43 m bandpass is 11.8 mas .",
    "we divide this range into @xmath44 bins 1 mas large , and integrate the fringe pattern @xmath45 over @xmath46 total bins , where @xmath47 is the number of wavelength channels spanning the bandpass .",
    "we sum the contributions for all sources in the field of view , and approximate photon noise by adding to each bin a random number of photons drawn from a gaussian with @xmath48 .",
    "we neglect all instrumental noise , such as read noise , dark current , thermal drift , etc .",
    ", basically assuming that sim is a perfect astrometer . these additional errors may become important for the faintest sources . to simulate sim astrometry and photometry , we fit the resulting fringe pattern to the form @xmath49 the number of sources , their positions and brightnesses",
    "are first estimated using the fourier transform method described above .",
    "starting with these initial values we fit by minimizing the error function @xmath50 .",
    "the fitted parameters are each source s brightness @xmath51 and position @xmath52 , as well as uniform surface brightness @xmath53 .",
    "this assumes that the product of the source spectrum , throughput , and detector response is constant with respect to wavelength , but it is not difficult to generalize to include simple spectral dependence .",
    "an estimate of the centroiding precision possible by such fringe fitting may be computed using the minimum variance bound , hereafter mvb @xcite .",
    "when fitting data to a function @xmath54 with normalization and one additional parameter @xmath55 , the minimum variance expected in the fitted @xmath55 is @xmath56^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 . using the mvb formula , and taking @xmath58 total photons from a single point source",
    ", we expect centroiding errors @xmath59 mas for scans covering 11 mas and the wavelength range @xmath60 m .",
    "using the white - light fringe pattern ( @xmath41=1 ) we expect @xmath61 mas .",
    "so for @xmath62 photons we expect 3.2 @xmath3as and 5 @xmath3as errors for the spectrally dispersed and white - light fringe pattern , respectively .",
    "this analytic estimate compares well with a monte carlo calculation of the expected astrometric errors using the above fringe fitting procedure .",
    "using bins of size 1 mas ( @xmath63 ) gives errors of 3.8 @xmath3as and 5 @xmath3as , in agreement with the mvb estimate for white - light fringes and somewhat larger than the mvb estimate for the spectrally dispersed fringe pattern .",
    "increasing the number of bins to @xmath64 gives monte carlo estimates in agreement with the mvb estimate .",
    "one might conclude from this that it is always better to centroid using spectrally dispersed fringes rather than broadband , white - light fringes since the errors are smaller for a given number of photons .",
    "however , keep in mind that we have neglected additional errors such as read noise , and there may be a reduction in throughput when the fringes are spectrally dispersed .",
    "having confirmed that our monte carlo errors agree with analytic estimates for single sources , we now explore errors for multiple sources .",
    "as mentioned earlier , additional sources in the field of view  can increase astrometry errors by contributing extra photon noise , and by distorting the fringe shape .",
    "fitting for multiple sources can not remove photon noise , but it can mitigate the distortion arising from superimposed fringes . to ease the comparison with unblended centroiding",
    "as described in the previous section , we set the on - source integration time to equal the time necessary to accumulate 340,000 photons from the science target . in terms of a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) ,",
    "this holds fixed the signal while letting the noise vary . when gauging how well fitting",
    "can remove the effects of blending , we should compare to a case with the same ratio of signal ( photons from science target ) to noise ( square root of total number of photons ) .",
    "for example , consider centroiding a single star in the presence of uniform surface brightness that contributes an equal number of photons as the star .",
    "since the s / n is smaller by a factor of @xmath65 relative to the isolated star case , the centroiding errors will be greater by a factor of @xmath65 .    as our first example , we consider measurements of a bright microlensing event in the lmc .",
    "we place a @xmath66 target at the phase center , and randomly place field stars in the 800 mas fov .",
    "the number of field stars , and their luminosity function ( lf ) , are chosen to match the crowding and lf of the lmc derived by the macho project @xcite .",
    "on average , macho finds 10 - 16 field stars within 1 - 2  of each observed star . to be conservative ,",
    "we have used 16 field stars in all of our simulations .",
    "the average brightness of a star drawn from this lf is approximately 1.4% the brightness of a @xmath66 star , so by adding 16 of them , we add approximately 22% more photons .",
    "we thus expect a roughly 10% increase in astrometry errors from photon noise alone .",
    "since we normalize the on - source observation time to give us 3.8 @xmath3as photon noise errors from the @xmath66 source alone , we expect 4.2 @xmath3as errors from photon noise .",
    "any additional errors will be due to source confusion @xcite .",
    "we follow the same fitting procedure described above , allowing for multiple sources at different positions and with different brightnesses .",
    "note , however , that faint sources may not be detectable above photon noise , so we will only be able to remove the brightest sources . since in this example we are only interested in the measurement errors for our single target , we only report measurement errors for the @xmath66 target .",
    "panel ( a ) of figure [ lmc_1 ] shows the histogram of position residuals for this simulation .",
    "overall , the standard deviation of this error distribution is @xmath67as , much larger than the 4.2 @xmath3as errors expected from photon noise .",
    "note , however , that the histogram may not be well described by a single `` average '' error value .",
    "we find that the error distribution is characterized by a narrow core superimposed on a slowly decaying tail of outliers .",
    "this histogram is quite similar to that found by @xcite , although for different reasons . in their simulations of white - light astrometry in crowded fields in m31 ,",
    "the lmc and galactic bulge , the long tail was due to the occasional bright field star . here ,",
    "in contrast , bright field stars are easily identified and removed using dispersed fringes .",
    "the long tail here is due to the occasional star landing nearby our target and becoming unresolved from it . to demonstrate this point , panel ( b ) of figure [ lmc_1 ] shows the histogram for the same simulation , but here we restrict field stars to lie more than 25 mas from our target .",
    "note that the long tails have vanished , and that the distribution s standard deviation has significantly diminished , to 5.3 @xmath3as , near to the value expected from photon noise .",
    "clearly , almost all of the 10.5 @xmath3as errors in this case arise from unresolved or marginally unresolved stars falling close to the target . @xcite",
    "have shown that these quite significant errors largely cancel for proper motion measurements , and so for many sim applications they are not a worry . for microlensing , however , confusion errors will be a problem in crowded fields .",
    "this is because microlensed stars undergo different proper motions than other stars in the field ( even binary companions ) , and their brightnesses vary during the course of the lensing event .",
    "therefore , the cancellation of errors that occurs for typical proper motion measurements will not occur here , and we expect proper motion errors of the same magnitude as the large position errors found above . fortunately , as we show below , it is still possible to disentangle the blend effect using the complete set of position measurements .",
    "thus , even in this most badly affected case , it is still possible to recover accurate masses and distances from astrometric microlensing events .",
    "generally , blend stars in sim observations will be far fainter than the intended science targets , which are chosen for their brightness .",
    "however , it is still worthwhile to consider what effects comparably bright sources would have . to quantify this ,",
    "we simulate sim measurements of two equally bright stars in the field of view .",
    "again we normalize the on - source integration time to give 340,000 photons from the science target .",
    "photon noise alone should thus give us errors of @xmath68as .",
    "we plot the results of our simulations in figure [ 2starposition ] .",
    "we can distinguish three kinds of blends from this figure .",
    "first , note that bright blends falling outside the central fringe are resolved by sim and can be removed .",
    "the offsets due to such sources are consistent with zero , and the dispersions ( @xmath69as ) are not much larger than what is expected from photon noise alone . clearly , such blends pose no threat to sim astrometry using spectrally dispersed fringes .",
    "the average offset is not zero , however , for sources falling within the central fringe .",
    "sources at distances @xmath70 2 mas are completely unresolved by sim .",
    "as expected , then , the measured centroid falls at the center of light , which is 0.5 mas for an equally bright blend at 1 mas , and 1 mas for an equally bright blend at 2 mas .",
    "note that although the offset is large , the standard deviation is small .",
    "this is just what we expect ; two equally bright sources at 0 and 1 mas should appear to sim to be a source twice as bright located at 0.5 mas , and so the errors should be smaller by a factor of @xmath71 compared to single source astrometry .",
    "the only blend positions giving significant errors are those that are marginally unresolved , i.e. falling barely inside the central fringe , at separations of 3 - 4 mas .",
    "there would seem to be no way to handle such blends with a single baseline orientation , however an additional pointing along a different baseline orientation could resolve the two sources .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ 2starposition ] that the vast majority of bright field stars will pose no threat to sim astrometry .",
    "the fact that the fit residuals are so small , comparable to photon noise , means that fitting can reliably remove the fringes from blending sources in the field of view .",
    "since we are able to recover @xmath3as astrometry even in the presence of blends , this must mean that we are able to fit the blend positions to microarcseconds themselves .",
    "since we are doing this for all important blends in the field of view , we are basically imaging the field of view .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore the imaging capabilities of sim using just the spectrally dispersed fringes measured along two orthogonal baselines . from the discussion above",
    ", we expect that we can get reliable positions as long as the sources are separated by more than one white - light coherence envelope . in terms of the fourier",
    "transform space , we expect to measure reliable positions for sources separated by more than one pixel . with @xmath41 wavelength channels",
    ", we have @xmath72 distinct pixels in the fourier conjugate variable since the brightness is real .",
    "we have assumed 64 channels , so we have 32 pixels . assuming that sources should be separated by 3 pixels for reliable positions",
    "means that we expect that for up to 10 sources in the fov , we can measure positions reliably . to test this , we simulated sim astrometric measurements of 10 stars in the field of view .",
    "we first simulated 10 stars of equal brightness ; the results are shown in panel ( a ) of figure [ 10stars ] .",
    "we find that the astrometric errors scale like @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the on - source integration time , so they are mainly due to photon noise .    for the simulation plotted in panel ( a ) ,",
    "the astrometric errors were @xmath75as . in panel",
    "( b ) , we plot the scaling of errors with brightness . using the above arguments on s / n",
    ", we expect the errors to scale inversely with each star s brightness , and this is verified in figure [ 10stars](b )",
    ". clearly , far smaller errors are attainable using dispersed fringes than the @xmath76as errors expected from synthesis imaging of many baseline orientations ( although keep in mind that we have neglected errors such as thermal drift ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that highly precise astrometric imaging may be achieved using only two sim pointings .",
    "one possible application of sim astrometry in crowded fields is microlensing .",
    "there are numerous astrophysical applications of sim observations of microlensing events @xcite , most of which entail crowded fields . for ordinary proper motion , @xcite have shown that astrometric errors arising from source confusion largely cancel .",
    "this is because any offset caused by additional sources remains basically constant as the target executes its proper motion , and cancels when the relative motion of the target is measured .",
    "however , this is not true for microlensing .",
    "the reason for this is that microlensing changes the target s apparent brightness while also causing the apparent proper motion .",
    "the astrometric offset caused by blending , therefore , does not remain constant and will not cancel .",
    "thus , we might expect that blending could seriously damage microlensing measurements , rendering sim observations useless in crowded fields .",
    "fortunately , the results discussed in previous sections indicate that blending by bright stars should not corrupt sim astrometry , except when those sources fall within the white - light coherence envelope of the target star . however , binary companions to lensed stars could easily fall inside the central fringe . since fringe fitting could never detect such stars , just as fringe fitting",
    "can not resolve the two microlensed images , our concerns about crowding could still hold .",
    "fortunately , as we describe below , even sources falling within the central fringe may be detected and removed , not from individual sim measurements , but by using the entire set of observations of the microlensing event .    as discussed in the previous section , field sources",
    "may be detected and essentially removed as long as they lie outside the central fringe of the target .",
    "in fact , even marginally resolved sources falling barely within the central fringe may be detected and removed if bright enough , by the distortion they cause in the fringe shape .",
    "the only sources undetectable are those which do not distort the fringe shape , but merely shift its centroid .",
    "these sources , lying well inside the central fringe , shift the fringe centroid to the center of light of the target and blend , and add all of their light to the target .",
    "what sim would detect would be a star of brightness equaling the sum of the target and blend s brightness , located at their center of light .",
    "for this reason , multiple blends falling inside the central fringe are equivalent to a single blend , and so we consider only the single blend case .",
    "such blends affect the microlensing lightcurve and astrometric motion in a simple way @xcite , and we show that sim observations may be corrected without degeneracy to extract the desired measurables .",
    "it is first necessary to review astrometric microlensing ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "microlensing of a single source by a single lens gives two images of the source .",
    "if the source is located at position @xmath77 relative to the lens , then the two images appear at positions with magnifications @xmath78 @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the angular einstein radius , @xmath81 is the lens - source separation in units of @xmath80 ( not the @xmath27 from the @xmath17 plane ) , and positions are relative to the lens position .",
    "sim can not resolve these images , so in the absence of blending it detects a source with position @xmath82 and magnification @xmath83 given by @xmath84 note that @xmath85 traces out an ellipse .",
    "it is now easy to see how unresolved blends affect this .",
    "if the lensed source has unlensed brightness @xmath86 , and the blend has brightness @xmath87 and position @xmath88 , then sim detects a source at position @xmath89 with brightness @xmath90 given by @xmath91 an example of this is given in figure [ blendexample ] . from the illustration",
    ", it may appear that blending would ruin sim astrometry , since the observed motion bears little resemblance to the unblended motion .",
    "however , our simulations indicate that it will be possible to recover the unblended motion .",
    "this is largely because sim s exquisite photometry ( recall @xmath92 ) permits the nondegenerate decomposition of the photometric lightcurve into lensed and unlensed ( blend ) light .",
    "that is , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath83 may be measured from the photometry alone .",

    "we have also assumed that the blend s proper motion is negligible for simplicity , but again it should not be difficult to generalize to moving blends .",
    "now , the photometry alone gives us @xmath106 and @xmath87 .",
    "the remaining 6 parameters are to be derived from the astrometry .",
    "first note that the unblended astrometric motion along the relative proper motion vector is antisymmetric in time with respect to @xmath104 , while the unblended motion perpendicular to it is symmetric ( see figure [ blendexample ] ) . the blend position and brightness are constant , and therefore symmetric .",
    "so if we multiply @xmath107 by @xmath108 , and antisymmetrize in time with respect to @xmath104 , then the blend parameters drop out , and the resulting motion is along the unblended proper motion vector .",
    "so we immediately get @xmath105 . we can estimate @xmath80 from @xmath95 , @xmath103 and the velocity @xmath109 at peak .",
    "again , note that the blend parameters make a constant contribution to the product @xmath110 , so by taking the difference of this quantity evaluated at two different times , the blend parameters drop out . we can thus estimate the unlensed source position @xmath101 by using the estimates for the other parameters , and the change in @xmath110 from peak to the end of the event",
    "now we have estimates for all parameters except the blend position @xmath102 , which we can guess by comparing the measured @xmath110 with the contributions from the other terms .",
    "thus , we can simply and accurately guess values for all of the microlensing parameters , and use these as initial estimates for fitting routines .",
    "this is also true if there are different blend fractions for the two baseline orientations .    to quantify the above statements , we have simulated sim observations of microlensing events .",
    "each of our simulated events has @xmath94 mas and @xmath98 days .",
    "the other parameters , such as @xmath103 , @xmath105 and @xmath101 were picked randomly .",
    "we measure 25 points during the event , evenly spaced in time , starting when the apparent magnification exceeds a threshold @xmath111 , and lasting @xmath112 from the trigger .",
    "this is probably not an optimal observing strategy , but it is not our intention here to optimize the strategy .",
    "each astrometric measurement is made following the procedure described in previous sections ",
    "the fringe pattern is simulated and fitted to recover the source position and brightness .",
    "we assume that the @xmath18 and @xmath19 measurements occur at the same time , although this assumption has no effect .",
    "if sim measures the orthogonal baselines at different times , say to minimize its overall slewing , no information should be lost .",
    "even if the baselines are not perfectly orthogonal , measurements of the microlensing parameters should not be seriously degraded .    to measure",
    "how badly crowding affects microlensing measurements , we first see how well the parameters may be recovered for a single , unblended source . to save on computation time , we used white - light fringe measurements , which as noted above should not be much worse than spectrally dispersed measurements for unblended sources .",
    "now , to measure the lens mass and distance , the parameters of interest are @xmath80 , @xmath95 , and @xmath105 . in the first panel of figure [ microres ] we plot",
    "fit residuals for the above observing strategy .",
    "note that these fits utilize both sim astrometric and photometric measurements of the microlensing events .",
    "we find that @xmath80 can be measured to 2.84% , and @xmath95 to 0.5% , for input values of @xmath94 mas and @xmath98 days .",
    "now , we add blend stars to see how badly they affect microlensing mass and distance measurements . here , we clearly need to use the full multifrequency fringe fit to resolve bright blend stars . from the individual fringe fits , which gave errors @xmath113as (",
    "twice as large as the unblended errors ) we might think that the errors here would be twice as large .",
    "we plot the fit residuals in the second panel of figure [ microres ] . we obtain errors @xmath99 mas , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 days .",
    "normalized to @xmath94 mas and @xmath98 days , these are fractional errors of 2.5% , 2.4% , and 0.71% respectively , as good as or better than the unblended white light errors ! again , the reason that these errors are not twice as big as the unblended errors is that the relatively large single measurement residuals mainly arose from unresolved sources falling inside the target s central fringe , which as we discussed may easily be removed .",
    "another important question to ask is how badly we would do without the spectral decomposition of the fringe pattern . to address this question",
    ", we repeated the above simulations , but this time used only white - light fringes .",
    "the resulting errors are plotted in figure [ microres ] .",
    "we find that the error distribution is bimodal , and neither blob is centered on the correct answer !",
    "the bulk of the fits underestimate @xmath80 by roughly 10% , with a scatter of @xmath116 , although a subset of events give somewhat overestimated @xmath80 , about @xmath117 too large , with a scatter of @xmath118 .",
    "this `` more correct '' subset , however , overestimates @xmath95 by roughly @xmath119 .",
    "so if we were to fit a white light measurement of a microlensing event in the lmc , we could be reasonably certain that the derived masses and distances would be incorrect by about 20% . while @xmath120 distances would certainly be good enough to resolve the question of the location of the lmc lenses , it is clearly preferable to utilize the channeled spectrum when possible .",
    "is in mas .",
    "[ wl_2star],scaledwidth=46.0% ]    we should be careful , however .",
    "most field blends drawn from the lmc luminosity function are less than a few percent of the brightness of a @xmath66 star . a comparably bright star landing in the field of view could corrupt measurements based upon white - light fringes @xcite . to illustrate this , we simulate white light sim measurements of microlensing events with an equally bright source in the field of view .",
    "now , it should be clear that sources within a few fringes of the target will hopelessly corrupt our measurements .",
    "however , sources falling outside the coherence envelope have significantly diminished fringe contrast , and one might hope that their effect would be minimal . these hopes are unfounded , as figure [ wl_2star ] illustrates .",
    "this figure plots the errors in @xmath80 as a function of source separation ( both in mas ) .",
    "even sources lying more than 100 mas away can induce 20% errors in the fit .",
    "a caveat to this statement is that the assumption of rectangular bandpass overestimates the effect of distant sources .",
    "the discontinuous jumps in @xmath30 at the edges of the bandpass give sidelobes in the white - light fringe envelope , which would be suppressed with a more smooth decline .",
    "nevertheless , distant bright sources are clearly cause for concern when centroiding white light fringes .",
    "now , space telescope or ground based ao snapshots could detect such sources .",
    "however , the positions available from such snapshots are rough by sim standards , @xmath121 mas , which is larger than a fringe size and larger than the length scale of the variations exhibited in figure [ wl_2star ] .",
    "thus , such high resolution snapshots would not be helpful for fitting multiple sources .",
    "how much better do we do if we have dispersed fringes ?",
    "as previous sections showed , bright sources landing outside the central fringe are easily detected and removed .",
    "therefore , such sources will not corrupt sim microlensing events beyond adding photon noise , which can be alleviated by integrating longer",
    ". we might worry about closer sources , however .",
    "res_2 + 15 ] shows results from the same simulation as above , but for blends within 50 mas , using the channeled spectrum .",
    "the errors are all small ( @xmath122 ) except for marginally resolved blends at about 3 mas separation which have 10 - 20% errors .",
    "bright sources at this distance fall within the central fringe and can not be clearly resolved , but are not well enough inside the central fringe to be treated as completely unresolved .",
    "in contrast , faint sources at this distance are effectively unresolved .",
    "this shows the extent to which spectrally dispersed fringes are useful .",
    "if the spectral decomposition of the fringe pattern is unavailable or costly to transmit , and we must rely upon white - light fringes , then high resolution space telescope or ao images will be required before following up a microlensing event with sim .",
    "detection of a bright field source in such snapshots would not help us remove the blend s effect , but instead would tell us that such events are hopelessly corrupted and should not be followed by sim . since bright events in the lmc are rare , and snapshots would tell us nothing about possible blends @xmath123 mas from the target which would also corrupt sim measurements , we hope that spectrally dispersed fringes will be available in the final sim design",
    ". high resolution snapshots may be useful with dispersed fringes as well , since they could be used to avoid orientations that project bright field stars inside the target s central fringe .",
    "we have shown that the spectral decomposition of the fringe pattern , which is often used for group delay estimation , also allows highly precise astrometry to be performed in crowded fields .",
    "even when white - light fringes are hopelessly corrupted , dispersed fringes allow microarcsecond positions to be measured . we find that any significant source outside of the central fringe ( @xmath124 mas ) of the target star may be detected and removed by fitting the two dimensional ( delay _ vs. _ wavelength ) fringe pattern , thereby restoring sim astrometry to the precision ( few @xmath3as ) expected for isolated sources .",
    "we have further shown that in mildly crowded stellar fields , precise astrometric imaging is possible using fringes in the channeled spectrum , with positional precision comparable to that expected for single star astrometry . although the details will depend upon sim s precise characteristics , we expect that imaging should be possible for up to 10 comparably bright sources in the field of view .",
    "we then illustrated our method with the specific example of astrometric microlensing .",
    "we showed that , although unresolved sources falling within the central fringe could corrupt individual astrometric measurements , accurate masses may still be measured by fitting the entire microlensing event . in this manner , confusion or blending errors may be brought below photon noise errors .",
    "for the worst case , i.e. lmc events which are the most crowded and have relatively faint sources , 5% mass measurements are still easily attainable .",
    "we also considered the effect of exceptionally bright field stars or binary companions , and showed that for all separations except about 3 mas , such bright sources also do not adversely affect sim astrometry .",
    "chance separations of 3 mas , however , can lead to 20% errors in mass and distance measurements from microlensing events .    in conclusion , we find that sim astrometry will not be corrupted by blending , and extremely precise imaging of mildly crowded fields may be performed using only two orthogonal baseline orientations , allowing microarcsecond positional measurements ."
