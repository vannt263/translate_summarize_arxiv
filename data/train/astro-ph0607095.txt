    "advances in submillimeter continuum imaging techniques in the past decade have dramatically improved our understanding of the structure of the dense , cold interstellar medium ( ism ) in star - forming regions . in every region studied , the cold , dusty ism exhibits a clumpy , often filamentary structure whose density maxima correspond to sites of present or future star formation activity . the primary metric used to describe",
    "this inhomogeneous structure is the clump / core  pc ) , dense condensations thought to be the immediate precursors of individual stars or small multiple systems .",
    "we use the term `` clump '' more generally to denote discrete structures which may form zero , one , or many stars and may therefore be much more massive than  cores  . in this sense , cores may be considered a subset of clumps . ]",
    "mass function .",
    "submillimeter continuum observations of the core mass function in nearby regions of low - mass star formation , such as serpens @xcite , @xmath3  oph @xcite , and orion  b @xcite , have provided compelling evidence that the mass function of cold , dense cores mirrors the stellar initial mass function ( imf , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it appears , therefore , that these dusty cores are the immediate precursors of stars .",
    "two main arguments are typically advanced in favor of this interpretation .",
    "first , both the stellar and core mass functions are well fit by salpeter - like power laws @xcite above @xmath41  @xmath5 .",
    "second , both the core and stellar mass functions appear to flatten out below @xmath41  @xmath5 and peak at about 0.1  @xmath5 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the core mass function and the stellar imf have similar _ shapes _ and intrinsic mass _",
    "scales_. thus , by applying a more or less constant core - to - star mass conversion efficiency , the core mass function can be converted into the stellar imf .    in papers",
    "i and ii in this series , we showed that , despite the large difference in the median clump mass , the clump mass function in massive star - forming regions ngc  7538 and m17 has a similar shape to that in low - mass star - forming regions ( @xcite ; papers  i and ii hereafter ) .",
    "in both ngc  7538 and m17 , we found that double power law fits to the clump mass functions produce exponents which are consistent with the salpeter mass function @xcite .",
    "the similarities in their shapes suggests that the clump mass functions in low- and high - mass star - forming regions may have similar origins .",
    "what if the mass function of massive clumps were found to resemble that of massive stars , as is the case for low - mass stars ?",
    "that would suggest that massive clumps could also be converted to massive stars ( or small multiple systems ) on a more or less one - to - one basis .",
    "such a finding would lend weight to theories which suggest that massive stars form by the collapse of individual clumps @xcite , rather than those which suggest that massive stars form by coalescence or competitive accretion @xcite .    to address these important matters , it is necessary to be able to accurately fit and interpret clump mass functions . in paper",
    "i , we argued that variations in analytic technique might account for much of the observed variation in the power - law exponents derived from fits to submillimeter continuum clump mass functions .",
    "in particular , we suggested that the systematic differences between the power - law exponents of clump mass functions in low- and high - mass regions probably result from the fact that the former are typically fit with two power law segments , while the latter are usually fit with only one ( compare @xcite and @xcite with @xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper , we extend and develop these arguments using a more thorough study of the available data on the submillimeter continuum clump mass function . in  [ sec : howtofit ] , we discuss how best to fit a clump / core mass function , paying special attention to means by which the fits may be misinterpreted . in  [ sec : funcform ] , we apply a consistent fitting methodology to determine which of several plausible functions best represents the clump / core mass function in a variety of star - forming regions .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : compare ] , we use non - parametric tests to determine whether the shape of the clump / core mass function varies significantly from region to region or changes with the mass scale studied .",
    "clump mass functions are commonly expressed in two forms : differential and cumulative .",
    "the differential mass function ( dmf ) , @xmath6 , has the advantages of permitting a simple poisson uncertainty analysis but suffers the arbitrariness of binning .",
    "binning can be a serious impediment to the accurate interpretation of stellar mass functions @xcite .",
    "thus , the differential mass function is not suitable for use when the total number of clumps , @xmath7 , is small .",
    "the cumulative mass function ( cmf ) , @xmath8 , requires a more complicated uncertainty analysis , but it suffers none of the problems associated with binning and therefore is suitable even in the small @xmath7 regime .",
    "the cmf is therefore preferable for studies of the submillimeter clump / core mass function where the total number of objects is typically @xmath9 .",
    "however , the cmf is easily misinterpreted , as we now demonstrate .",
    "consider a very simple mass function whose dmf is well - fit by a single power law of the form    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the number of objects in a mass bin of width @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "it is sometimes assumed that the complementary cumulative mass function is also a power law whose exponent differs from @xmath14 by 1 :    @xmath15    for @xmath16 .",
    "the expectation is therefore that , if the dmf is well represented by a single power law , the cmf will be too . in measured mass functions , this may not be the case .",
    "a measured mass function contains a finite sample of clumps with an upper mass limit , @xmath17 .",
    "this upper mass limit can be either a real cutoff on the mass distribution or the result of finite sampling . in either case",
    ", the dmf will remain the simple power law of equation  [ eq : dmfeq ] , but the cmf will deviate from equation  [ eq : pl1 ] . integrating the dmf of equation  [ eq : pl1 ] to an upper limit of @xmath17",
    ", we obtain    @xmath18    the practical significance of the difference between equations .",
    "[ eq : pl1 ] and [ eq : pl2 ] depends on the range of clump masses ( i.e. the value of @xmath19 ) , the value of the power - law exponent , @xmath14 , and the number of clumps in the sample , n@xmath20 . in figures  [ fig : fake_dmfs ] and [ fig : fake_cmfs ] , we use simulated data sets to show how the shape of both the dmf and cmf depend on each of these parameters . to simulate a clump mass function",
    ", we randomly draw n@xmath20 masses from the interval @xmath21 to @xmath17 following the distribution @xmath22 .",
    "we do this for representative values of @xmath7 = 50 , 100 , and 1000 .",
    "we simulate power law exponents of @xmath14 = -1.5 , -2.0 , and -2.5 .",
    "this range encompasses the exponents of the salpeter imf ( @xmath14 = -2.35 ; @xcite ) , the co clump mass function ( @xmath23 ; @xcite ) , and the values typically found in submillimeter continuum clump surveys .",
    "we vary the ratio @xmath24 by holding @xmath21 constant at 1 ( the mass units are arbitrary ) and taking @xmath17 values of @xmath25 , and 10@xmath26 . for each combination of n@xmath20 , @xmath14 , and @xmath27",
    ", we produce a representative data set by averaging 1000 randomly - generated sets .",
    "figures  [ fig : fake_dmfs ] and [ fig : fake_cmfs ] show the resulting dmfs and cmfs , respectively . note that we follow the popular convention of normalizing @xmath8 by n@xmath28 .",
    "clumps drawn randomly from a mass function of the form @xmath29 ( _ thick dashed line _ ) , with n@xmath20 and @xmath14 values as shown . to produce each plotted dmf",
    ", 1000 simulated data sets were averaged together .",
    "the four simulated dmfs plotted in each panel vary in the range of masses from which the simulated masses were drawn : 1100 ( _ solid line _ ) , 11000 ( _ dotted line _ ) , 110@xmath30 ( _ short dashed line _ ) , and 110@xmath26 ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) .",
    "the mass units are arbitrary .",

    "[ fig : fake_dmfs ] , the line types indicate the clump mass range from which simulated masses ( arbitrary units ) were drawn : 1100 ( _ solid line _ ) , 11000 ( _ dotted line _ ) , 110@xmath30 ( _ short dashed line _ ) , and 110@xmath26 ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) .",
    "the thick dashed line represents the power law distribution from which the clump masses were drawn . for sufficiently steep power laws ( @xmath32 ) , the cmf is likely to be well - fit by a single power law , even when the total number of clumps is small .",
    "however , for shallower power laws ( @xmath33 ) and cmfs spanning smaller clump mass ranges , the plotted cmf deviates significantly from the single power law form .",
    "[ fig : fake_cmfs],width=576 ]    by construction , the dmfs shown in figure  [ fig : fake_dmfs ] all follow the input mass distributions . however , as shown in figure  [ fig : fake_cmfs ] , the cmfs clearly deviate from the power law form suggested by equation  [ eq : pl1 ] . as seen in the right column of figure  [ fig : fake_cmfs ]",
    ", a steep power law ( @xmath34 ) overwhelms the effects of both @xmath7 and @xmath17 , recovering essentially the pure single power law in all cases .",
    "as seen in the middle and left columns of figure  [ fig : fake_cmfs ] , however , shallower power laws ( @xmath35 ) often cause the cmf to deviate from the pure power law behaviour expected from equation  [ eq : pl1 ] .",
    "this is especially the case when the ratio of @xmath19 is small ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fake_cmfs ] ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that fitting real data sets with single power laws of the form of equation  [ eq : pl1 ] would give highly misleading power law exponents . to achieve accurate results ,",
    "fitted functions must account for the maximum clump mass , as in equation  [ eq : pl2 ] .",
    "many of the simulated cmfs shown in figure  [ fig : fake_cmfs ] strongly resemble the cmfs derived from observations of real star - forming regions . to account for their curvature ,",
    "these observational cmfs are typically fitted with two power law segments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "that intrinsically single power - law cmfs should so closely resemble those typically fit with two power laws implies that great care should be taken in interpreting the shape of the cmf and in choosing functions with which to fit it . in simple cases , such as the single power - law simulated here , a check of the dmf should help constrain the functional forms which might be fitted to the cmf . even in this simple case , which is simpler than is likely to be encountered in real data",
    ", care must be taken when fitting the cmf in order to recover the correct power - law exponent : accounting for @xmath17 is clearly essential . in cmfs measured from real observations , the effects of incompleteness , small - number statistics , and binning can all lead to uncertainty about the functional form of the clump mass function .",
    "we believe that particular care is warranted where the observed clump / core mass function encompasses the peak in the stellar imf at @xmath40.1  @xmath5 @xcite . in such cases , incompleteness and a real physical turnover in the mass function are likely to be difficult to distinguish .",
    "we now turn to the question of the functional form of the clump / core mass function .",
    "the form most commonly employed in studies of low - mass star - forming regions is a double power law above @xmath40.1@xmath5 with a break between the power law segments at @xmath40.5@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this is essentially the same form as found for the galactic field single - star imf @xcite .",
    "however , a double power law is not the only plausible shape for the clump mass function . in paper",
    "ii , we showed that the m17 clump mass function is better fit by a lognormal distribution than by a double power law .",
    "moreover , in ",
    "[ sec : howtofit ] above , we noted that the finite clump mass range in any real clump mass function adds curvature to the cmf .",
    "this curvature can make a mass spectrum which is intrinsically a single power law appear to adopt a shape similar to those usually fit with a double power law .",
    "additional uncertainties about the shape of the clump / core mass function arise due to the diversity of techniques used by different authors to fit such mass functions .    to eliminate the effects of differing fitting techniques",
    ", we have gathered all of the published lists of clump / core masses from unbiased millimeter and submillimeter continuum surveys of star - forming regions and fit them in a homogeneous manner . in table",
    "[ tab : studies ] , we summarize these 11 different clump / core mass functions measured in 7 different star - forming regions . in cases where the original authors used more than one set of assumptions about the dust temperature",
    "when calculating the clump masses , we use the masses calculated assuming a uniform dust temperature , which is the method most widely used .",
    "the only exceptions are the studies by @xcite and @xcite , which divide the clumps into several groups , each with a single dust temperature , before calculating their masses .",
    "not all of the studies made comparable attempts to distinguish between starred and starless cores / clumps , so we have used the complete list of all objects in each case ( except our own study of m17 from paper  ii , where we have two comparable data sets in which clumps coincident with msx sources were removed in a consistent way ) .",
    "the clumps in these 7 star - forming regions span more than 5 orders of magnitude in mass ( 0.0516000  @xmath5 ) and more than two orders of magnitude in linear size .",
    "the median clump masses range from 0.17  @xmath5 in @xmath3  oph to 470  @xmath5 in rcw  106 . for comparison with the theory of turbulent fragmentation",
    ", we also include in our analysis a list of clumps extracted from a computational hydrodynamic simulation of 4.6 jeans masses of turbulent , self - gravitating gas ( run b5 of @xcite , tp04 hereafter ) .",
    "there are two caveats to any comparison made between the tp04 and observational mass functions .",
    "first , the dimensionless nature of the tp04 simulations means the absolute mass scale is arbitrary .",
    "second , the number of jeans masses simulated by tp04 is considerably less than is found in real star - forming regions , which could have consequences for the number and mass distribution of fragments formed .",

    "visual inspection of the plot suggests that the logn function fits equally well , although the @xmath54 values suggest otherwise .",

    "second , there is the agreement among the @xmath2 and @xmath41 values from region to region , despite the significant differences in the relevant clump mass scales .",
    "third , there is the presence of a break between the steep and shallow sections of the mass function in high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "if this break is real , it implies that the clump mass function is _ not _ a single unbroken power law above 1  @xmath5 .",
    "this result holds true despite the uncertainties in the absolute mass calibration in each study ( see  [ sec : massunc ] ) finally , there is the agreement between the power law exponents of the clump and stellar mass functions , again despite the differences in mass scales .",
    "there is already ample theoretical evidence that lognormal mass functions can result when any sufficiently stochastic process , such as turbulent fragmentation , governs the evolution of the clump masses .",
    "moreover , lognormal mass functions can be viewed as one extremum of a continuum of shapes whose other extremum is the power - law mass function .",
    "numerical simulations have repeatedly shown that turbulent fragmentation can naturally produce both power - law and lognormal mass functions whose shapes are largely independent of the intrinsic mass scale @xcite .",
    "several authors have invoked the central limit theorem to demonstrate analytically that lognormal mass functions arise whenever a large number of random parameters act to set the clump masses @xcite .",
    "conversely , power - law mass functions can arise when fewer random parameters affect each clump s mass .",
    "these random parameters could derive from successive turbulent fragmentations or n - body gravitational encounters among clumps .",
    "we might therefore imagine the following scenario to explain the trend toward lognormal mass functions in low - mass regions and power - law mass functions in high - mass regions ( see table  [ tab : fitpvals ] ) .",
    "a molecular cloud undergoes turbulent fragmentation , producing an initially power - law clump mass function ; as the clumps continue to fragment and interact , their mass function approaches a lognormal distribution ; by the time the `` clumps '' have become `` cores '' , they have achieved a fully lognormal mass distribution . as the objects furthest down the chains of turbulent fragmentation and n - body interactions , the masses of the cores would have been maximally influenced by random processes .    in this scenario ,",
    "spatially unresolved observations of a set of cores whose mass distribution is lognormal could effectively restore the less - evolved double power law mass function by blurring together smaller cores into semblances of their antecedent clumps .",
    "this hypothesis would explain the trend toward double power law mass functions seen in the more distant regions , such as ngc  7538 , w43 , and rcw  106 , where the spatial resolution of the observations is nt sufficient to adequately distinguish all of the cores from one another .",
    "if the core / clump mass function in both low- and high - mass star - forming regions were found to be consistent with the stellar imf ( uncorrected for unresolved multiples ) , it would relax the need to invoke processes such as coalescence and competitive accretion @xcite to explain the formation of more massive stars .",
    "such consistency would also argue in favor of theories which predict that massive stars can form by a scaled - up version of molecular cloud core collapse with disk accretion @xcite .    as shown in table  [",
    "tab : fitparams ] , the mean power law exponents from the double power law fits to the 11 observational cmfs are @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "@xcite cites power law exponents for the mean galactic field single - star imf of @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "the agreement between the @xmath2 values of the clump and stellar mass functions is intriguing . unlike the @xmath41 values , which may be strongly affected by incompleteness in the clump mass functions ( see next section ) , the @xmath2 values should be quite reliable .",
    "thus , the agreement between the stellar and clump @xmath67 values reinforces the ideas that the stellar imf originates in the mass function of clumps in a fragmented molecular cloud and that the stellar mass function can be obtained by an essentially one - to - one conversion of clumps into stars ( or binaries ) .",
    "if the high - mass end of the stellar imf can be obtained by converting clumps into stars on a more - or - less one - to - one basis , there may be no need to invoke processes such as coalescence or competitive accretion .",
    "@xcite has shown that the variation in the measured power law exponents for the stellar imf is compatible with normal measurement variation and need not represent physical region - to - region variation .",
    "we suggest that the same description could apply equally well to the range of power law exponents derived from clump mass functions in different regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alphaplot ] ) .",
    "more measurements of @xmath2 would be required to confirm this hypothesis in the cases of both the stellar imf and the clump mass function .",
    "@xcite has shown that real region - to - region variations in the imf are physically plausible , but may be masked by small - number statistics , which is certainly a concern with the clump / core mass functions taken to date .",
    "can we identify a mass scale at which the apparent agreement between the clump and stellar mass functions breaks down ?",
    "of the parameters which control the shapes of the fitted functions , namely @xmath57 for the lognormal fits and the @xmath14 values for the power law fits , none shows a trend with the median clump mass of the regions ( see table  [ tab : fitparams ] ) .",
    "thus , the fits suggest that the shape of the clump mass function is not very sensitive to the clump mass range being fit . there is also no clear break between the cmfs which do mirror the shape of the stellar imf and those which do not , despite the breadth in the clump mass ranges .",
    "again , this surprising result suggests that the intrinsic shape of the stellar imf may be apparent in the clump mass function on mass and linear scales substantially larger than those previously considered .",
    "both interferometry and the chopping technique used by single - dish submillimeter telescopes filter out emission on some spatial scales .",
    "clump - finding algorithms may have a similar effect .",
    "therefore , all of the observations used to generate the cmfs discussed in this paper are subject to some form of spatial filtering , and hence to incompleteness and uncertainty .",
    "we are therefore motivated to ask whether spatial filtering and related effects introduced during data acquisition and reduction can introduce a sufficient number of random perturbations to the clump masses to ensure that a lognormal mass function is obtained .",
    "spatial filtering of flux can systematically alter the derived clump masses .",
    "the magnitude of the discrepancy would depend on the size ( and therefore the mass ) of each clump .",
    "although this possibility should be explored further , several arguments suggest it does not substantially alter the shape of the clump mass function .",
    "first , the mass function of clumps extracted from infrared dust extinction maps , which are essentially free of spatial filtering , is very similar to those derived from submillimeter continuum observations ( j. alves , private communication ) .",
    "if the clump extraction algorithms exerted a strong spatial filtering effect , we would need to understand how at least three different methods used by the authors of the papers studied here all produce similar mass functions .",
    "moreover , the effects of spatial filtering would affect observations of both low- and high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "if it were a significant effect , it seems unlikely that observations of low - mass star - forming regions would still manage to produce a core mass function which appears to agree with the stellar imf .",
    "finally , we note that the clump cmf extracted from the turbulent fragmentation simulations of tp04 is not subject to observational spatial filtering and its shape is entirely compatible with those of the observational cmfs ( tp04 used a custom clump extraction technique ) . for these reasons , it is difficult to explain how the shape of the clump mass function , and its similarity from region to region might be accounted for by spatial filtering .    whether or not the clump mass functions are strongly affected by spatial filtering , they are certainly all affected by incompleteness . for spatially extended objects ,",
    "the detection threshold is a limiting surface brightness , meaning that a clump of any mass could go undetected if its flux were spread thinly across the sky .",
    "thus , the clump sample may be incomplete in any mass range . at the moment",
    ", there is no reliable way to correct millimeter and submillimeter continuum clump / core mass functions for incompleteness .",
    "if incompleteness is a significant determinant of the shape of each cmf , its effects are likely to be felt most strongly at their low - mass ends , where it may be partly responsible for the shallower slope of the mass function .",
    "consequently , the degree of incompleteness might influence the position of the break , @xmath42 , between the two power laws when a double power law is fitted to a given mass function . in most studies to date , the distribution of clumps in mass - radius space shows a ( sometimes slight ) separation from the detection threshold at its high - mass end @xcite .",
    "hence , we do not think it likely that the fitted @xmath2 values are strongly affected by sensitivity - induced incompleteness .",
    "the @xmath55 values , however , are likely to be significantly impacted by incompleteness .",
    "there are several ways to test for the related effects of incompleteness and spatial filtering .",
    "high spatial resolution observations of the more distant star - forming regions in the sample will reveal the extent to which currently unresolvable structure will change the shape of the clump / core mass function .",
    "observations of more distant regions should also mitigate the effects of chopping by limiting the loss of emission to spatial scales much larger than those of typical molecular cloud cores .",
    "comparison of submillimeter continuum and dust extinction maps of identical regions should provide strong constraints on the effect of spatial filtering in the former type of observations .",
    "finally , observations with total power detectors , such as scuba-2 , will eliminate the effects of chop - based spatial filtering .",
    "scuba-2 s greater sensitivity will also help reveal those clumps not detectable by the present generation of submillimeter and millimeter detectors .",
    "it should be noted that , while there are significant uncertainties in the absolute calibration of clump masses , these uncertainties are not large enough to fundamentally change the conclusions of the preceding analysis .",
    "the calibration of the absolute mass scale in each study we reference relies on assumptions about the dust temperature and emissivity in each region . typically , as in papers  i and ii",
    ", values typical of each region are applied to all of the clumps it contains .",
    "the dust emissivity in star - forming regions may be uncertain by up to a factor of 2 ( i.e. it may range between @xmath412 ) and the temperature may be uncertain by perhaps a factor of four ( i.e. the mean clump temperature is likely to lie within 1040  k ) . in the most extreme case , whereby the mean temperature and dust emissivity in a region",
    "are assumed to be 10  k and 1 , respectively , but are actually 40  k and 2 , the clump masses would all be overestimated by a factor of @xmath430 .",
    "however , referring to table  [ tab : fitparams ] , we see that even this large uncertainty is insufficient to account for the observed variation in the peak mass , @xmath82 from the logn fits or the break mass , @xmath42 , from the 2pl fits .",
    "both of these parameters range over @xmath83 orders of magnitude , which is a much greater variation than can be accounted for by the largest plausible uncertainties in the dust emissivity and temperature . in addition , the mass calibrations are unlikely to be incorrect by the same amount or in the same direction in all of the studies . finally , we emphasize that uncertainties in the absolute mass calibration do not affect the _ shapes _ of the various clump mass functions .",
    "the clump mass function is one of the most important descriptors of the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "it tells us how the masses of pre - stellar condensations are distributed , leaving us to determine how such a distribution could give rise to the observed distribution of stellar masses .",
    "thus , it is important to understand how the clump mass function varies from region to region , between low- and high - mass star - forming regions , and whether it varies more or less than the stellar imf .",
    "this information will help evaluate theories which posit different formation mechanisms for stars of different masses .",
    "for example , if low- and high - mass star forming regions had systematically different clump mass functions but compatible stellar mass functions , it would be evidence that the mechanisms of low- and high - mass stars were different .    in figure",
    "[ fig : allcmfs ] , we plot all 11 of the observational cmfs from table  [ tab : studies ] in the same panel . to facilitate comparisions among the mass functions",
    ", they have all been renormalized such that they share a common median clump mass .",
    "this renormalization preserves the shape of each mass function .",
    "like figure  [ fig : alphaplot ] , figure  [ fig : allcmfs ] shows that there is no clear trend in the shape of the mass function with the median mass in each region . particularly at their high - mass ends , where incompleteness is least significant , there is no clear segregation between the cmfs of low- and high - mass star - forming regions .    .",

    "the cmfs all appear to have the same ( or very similar ) _ shapes _ , despite the differences in their intrinsic mass _ scales_. because the k - s test is least sensitive to the high- and low - mass tails of the cmfs , it is less affected by the few most massive clumps in each region which , as we saw in ",
    "[ sec : funcform ] , can bias the determination of the functional form of the cmf .",
    "the combined results of the parametric fits from  [ sec : funcform ] with the non - parametric k - s test comparisons provide compelling evidence that the shapes of the clump and core mass distributions in all of the regions considered are strongly linked to each other and perhaps also to the stellar imf .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the issue of the functional form of the clump / core mass function derived from millimeter / submillimeter continuum observations of galactic star - forming regions .",
    "we have demonstrated that , even in the case of a strict single power - law mass function , great care must be taken in fitting the cumulative form of the mass function to accurately measure the exponent of this power law .",
    "unexpected curvature can be introduced into the cmf when the range of masses or the number of objects is small , particularly when the power law is shallow ( @xmath22 with @xmath90 ) . in some cases ,",
    "an intrinsically single power - law mass function might appear better fit by two or more power laws . in practice",
    ", the mass function is unlikely to be a pure single power law , so the potential to be mislead when fitting the cumulative mass function is even greater .",
    "we have fit 11 independent measurements of the clump / core mass function extracted from millimeter and submillimeter continuum observations of 7 star - forming regions .",
    "the masses of the clumps / cores in these regions collectively span more than five orders of magnitude .",
    "we find that , in regions where the median clump / core mass is less than a few @xmath5 , the clump / core mass function is best fit by a lognormal distribution . in more massive regions ,",
    "a double power law provides a better fit to the clump cmf . at intermediate masses , both the lognormal and the double power law",
    "adequately describe the cmf .",
    "this difference in the functional form of the clump mass function may represent an evolution toward a lognormal mass function at lower masses and smaller spatial scales .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with theoretical explanations for the origin of a lognormal mass function via stochastic processes such as turbulent fragmentation and gravitational n - body interactions .",
    "the shape of the clump / core mass function does not appear to be a strong function of the intrinsic mass scale .",
    "the transition from lognormal to double power - law mass functions is fairly subtle .",
    "the mean value of the power - law exponent of the high - mass end of the clump / core mass function is found to be @xmath76 , consistent with the salpeter mass function .",
    "this result suggests that the shape of the stellar imf may be apparent in the clump mass function on clump mass scales of several tens of @xmath5 or more and linear scales of several tenths of a parsec .",
    "it also suggests that molecular cloud cores may be converted into stars ( or small multiple systems ) on an essentially one - to - one basis .",
    "this scenario is consistent with theories in which massive stars form by core collapse and disk accretion",
    ". it also relaxes the need to invoke either coalescence or competitive accretion to explain the formation of massive stars , though these processes probably do occur at some level .",
    "this result deserves further investigation , especially to constrain any instrumental or post - processing effects which may affect it .    the similarities among the shapes of the various clump / core mass functions",
    "are confirmed to be statistically significant using non - parametric pair - wise comparisons of the cmfs . in 44 of 55 comparisons , after normalizing away the differences in their median masses , the clump / core mass functions are found to have a high likelihood of representing random samplings from the same parent distribution . that the observational cmfs agree well with the cmf of clumps extracted from a simulation of self - gravitating turbulent gas",
    "suggests that turbulent fragmentation is one possible sufficient explanation for the shape of the clump / core mass function .",
