    "recent observations have shown that powerful radio sources in galaxy clusters are concentrated toward the cluster center . in a survey of 30 clusters of galaxies ,",
    "morrison & owen ( 2003 ) found that the spatial distribution of high luminosity radio galaxies in rich clusters is described by a small core radius .",
    "in particular , they found that the spatial distribution of galaxies depend on their radio power high luminosity radio galaxies have a smaller core radius ( @xmath7 mpc ) than low luminosity ones ( @xmath8 mpc ) .",
    "recently , lin & mohr ( 2007 ) have collected data for 188 rich clusters , and they have analyzed the spatial distribution of radio galaxies contained within them .",
    "they found that the spatial distribution of powerful radio sources could be fit by the ` universal ' navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro , frenk , white 1997 ) with a larger concentration parameter than needed for fitting the total mass distribution of the cluster . and",
    "similar to the findings to morrison & owen ( 2003 ) , they discovered that the concentration of galaxies in the spatial distribution increased with their radio power .",
    "many explanations can be put forward for such a steep spatial distribution of radio galaxies in clusters .",
    "it is possible that the increased number density of galaxies in the inner region facilitates mergers and interactions that can trigger active galactic phenomena and increase the radio luminosity of galaxies .",
    "also , radio galaxies are mostly associated with giant ellipticals which generally inhabit the central regions of rich clusters . moreover",
    ", the increased pressure of the hot x - ray gas of rich clusters in the inner region may enhance the radio luminosity of frii radio galaxies by confining the lobes with high pressure .",
    "there is also a dynamical aspect of the problem besides these factors .",
    "if the hosts of radio loud objects in general are massive galaxies , then dynamical friction will lead to mass segregation in galaxy clusters , and radio galaxies will settle toward the cluster center over many orbits .",
    "the situation is analogous to the phenomenon of large density of millisecond pulsars in the central regions of globular clusters .",
    "this concentration is believed to be due to favorable conditions in the cluster core for accretion spin - up of neutron stars leading to the phenomenon of millisecond pulsars .",
    "however , it is first the process of mass segregation in globular clusters owing to dynamical friction that makes massive stars settle toward the center , thereafter leading to an increased number density of neutron stars in the inner regions ( meylan & heggie 1997 ) .    mass segregation by the process of dynamical friction is also expected to occur in galaxy clusters and it will lead to a preponderance of massive galaxies toward the cluster center . this process is likely to occur simultaneously with other processes of galactic evolution that may make galaxies in the inner region prone to becoming a radio loud source . to study the dynamical aspect of the evolution of spatial distribution of radio sources , one would need to isolate it from other evolutionary process and determine if it is a significant process by itself .",
    "we wish to address this issue in this paper .    the main motivation to isolate the dynamical aspect of the problem comes from the fact that the hosts of radio galaxies are often massive galaxies , irrespective of their membership in clusters or groups of galaxies .",
    "recent statistical studies of radio loud objects show that their hosts are predominantly massive objects ( containing black holes of mass @xmath9 m@xmath1 ) ( best 2005 ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that dynamical evolution of massive galaxies in clusters will have a significant effect on the spatial distribution of radio loud sources in galaxy clusters , irrespective of other processes that contribute toward increasing the radio output of a galaxy .",
    "here we focus on the dynamical evolution of the distribution of massive galaxies in clusters from dynamical friction , and compare with recent observations .",
    "powerful radio sources ( with @xmath10 w hz@xmath11 ) have been found to be associated with giant ellipticals , the oldest and the most massive galaxies in the universe .",
    "best ( 2005 ) have discussed the mass dependence of radio activity with the help of a statistical analysis of the radio properties of galaxies from the 2df survey .",
    "they have shown shown that the probability of a galaxy containing a central black hole of a certain mass to have a given ( or larger ) radio luminosity depends strongly on the black hole mass ; the probability scales as @xmath12 .",
    "the ( volume weighted ) distribution of the black hole mass in the sample showed that most radio loud objects had a black hole mass in the range @xmath13 m@xmath1 , peaking at @xmath14 m@xmath1 .",
    "the total mass of the host galaxy of radio loud sources is related to the central black hole mass .",
    "fine ( 2006 ) found from the analysis of the 2df qso survey that for a qso host containing a central black hole of mass @xmath15 m@xmath1 , the total dark matter mass of the host galaxy is @xmath16 m@xmath1 .",
    "based on these considerations , we will consider galaxies of total ( dark matter ) mass of @xmath16 m@xmath1 , and containing a central black hole of mass @xmath17 m@xmath1 , as examples of host galaxies of radio loud objects in our calculation below .",
    "consider a galaxy cluster of total mass @xmath18 and velocity dispersion @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the average mass distribution inside the cluster follows the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro , frenk , white 1997 ) , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the concentration parameter , and @xmath23 is the virial radius .",
    "the virial radius is fixed by the overdensity estimated from spherical collapse model , which is approximately @xmath24 at the present epoch , for the standard @xmath25cdm cosmological model ( @xmath26 ) ( see , e.g. , komatsu & seljak ) .",
    "the characteristic density @xmath27 is then given by , _",
    "s = c^3 ( z ) _",
    "c(z ) 3 [ ( 1+c ) - c ( 1+c ) ] , [ eq : rhos ] where @xmath28 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath29 . for a large range of length scales ( barring the central and outer regions of the cluster ) , the mass density @xmath30 .",
    "the mass distribution in these parts will be characterized by a near constant velocity dispersion @xmath19 .",
    "we assume a concentration parameter @xmath31 for a rich cluster as suggested by n - body simulations ( navarro 1996 ) .",
    "we also assume a maxwellian distribution of velocities of objects in the clusters with dispersion @xmath19 , and assume the average mass of galaxies to be @xmath32 .",
    "consider the motion of a massive galaxy of mass @xmath33 and speed @xmath34 in this cluster .",
    "its motion in the background potential of numerous small galaxies of mass @xmath32 will be perturbed by random interactions with these galaxies .",
    "these perturbations will amount to a force of dynamical friction given by , f_drag ( r ) = -4 g^2 m^2 n m v^2 [ erf ( x)-2 x ( -x^2 ) ] , where @xmath35 is the number density of galaxies of mass @xmath32 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamical friction will slowly change its orbital parameters and the massive galaxy will slowly settle toward the cluster center over many orbits .",
    "consider a near circular orbit of the massive galaxy .",
    "then , for a large range of length scales in the cluster , we have @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the coulomb logarithm is approximately @xmath39 ( binney & tremaine 1987 , eqn 7 - 13b ) . for @xmath0 m@xmath1 , and @xmath40 km / s ( see below for the choice of this value )",
    ", we have @xmath41 . if we take @xmath42 as the cluster core radius which is @xmath43 kpc for rich clusters , then @xmath44 .",
    "in this case , the product @xmath45 \\ln \\lambda \\sim 1.1 $ ] , and we assume it to be unity for simplicity . also , we will use the average density of matter @xmath46 in the above expression .",
    "if we consider an inspiraling orbit of a massive galaxy owing to the dynamical friction from its interactions with average mass galaxies , then one can estimate the time scale over which the distance of the massive galaxy from the cluster center would significantly decrease . since the angular momentum @xmath47 changes according to @xmath48 , we have ~- 4 g^2 m v^3 , [ eq : fr ] since the circular velocity @xmath34 changes little in the region of the cluster potential under consideration ( where @xmath30 and the circular velocity @xmath37 ) .",
    "ostriker & turner ( 1979 ) also used this equation to study dynamical friction in galaxy clusters ( see also nusser & sheth 1999 ) .",
    "we can estimate the time scale of dynamical friction as , @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 km / s , @xmath0 m@xmath1 , and using the matter density at the characteristic radius @xmath51 ( using eqn [ eq : rhos ] ) , @xmath52 }   \\sim 10^{-26.6}$ ] g @xmath53 , for @xmath31 and @xmath54 , we have , t_dyn ~&&2.4 gyr ( v 10 ^ 3 km / s ) ^3 + & & ( m 10 ^ 12.5 m _ ) ^-1 ( 10 ^ -26.6 g / cc ) ^-1 .",
    "it is believed that rich clusters formed at @xmath4 , judging from the lack of evolution in x - ray luminosity function of clusters up to @xmath55 ( see , e.g. , rosati 2002 ) .",
    "the mass distribution would have settled into a nfw profile by that epoch . if such a cluster contained a few massive galaxies far from its center",
    ", then the above estimate shows that these massive galaxies would have spiralled toward the cluster center in a few gyr time scale .",
    "the time evolution of the orbit of a massive galaxy embedded in a galaxy cluster can be obtained from numerically solving eqn [ eq : fr ] .",
    "a few representative cases are shown in figure 1 in for @xmath56 m@xmath1 , @xmath57 km s@xmath11 .",
    "we compute the density distribution of the cluster halo for @xmath58 m@xmath1 collapsing at @xmath59 .",
    "we emphasize that the results shown in figure 1 are approximate and are based on several assumptions .",
    "firstly , we have assumed circular orbit . but",
    "the results shown in figure 1 can be interpreted as the evolution of the radial distance averaged over an orbital period .",
    "also , we have neglected the effect of the massive galaxy being an extended object . in reality , the galaxy will be tidally stripped , decreasing its mass , as it spirals inward ( see nusser and sheth ( 1999 ) for a discussion on this effect ) .",
    "= 0.5    -3 mm    we can then ask how the distribution of such massive galaxies would evolve in a statistical sense , beginning with the nfw profile of a given concentration parameter .",
    "a given cluster will contain only a handful of massive galaxies , but we can consider a statistical ensemble of clusters with the same concentration parameter and total mass , which will contain several massive galaxies with initial orbital parameters such that the total mass distribution of the ensemble cluster resembles a nfw profile of the assumed concentration parameter ( here @xmath31 ) .",
    "slowly , over time and many orbits , the massive galaxies will settle toward the center , and their mass distribution will change .    to estimate the gradual change in the mass distribution of massive galaxies immersed in a gravitational potential determined by several average mass galaxies , we divide the cluster into several annuli , and",
    "compute the cluster halo density in the @xmath60-th annulus as that given by the nfw profile for the average radius in that annulus .",
    "then we ascribe an initial number of massive galaxies in each annulus , @xmath61 , so that the density profile of these galaxies ( @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the volume of the @xmath60-th annulus ) follows the nfw profile with same concentration ( @xmath31 here ) .",
    "we normalize the number of massive galaxies in different annuli by the density at the outermost annulus , which does not change owing to negligible dynamical friction at that radius .",
    "we first calculate the change in radius of these massive galaxies initially stationed at each annulus using eqn ( [ eq : fr ] ) .",
    "we compute their radii after an elapsed time interval , and then we re - calculate the number of massive galaxies in all annuli @xmath64 at this epoch , again normalized by the number of massive galaxies in the outermost annulus . from this",
    "we calculate the number density of massive galaxies in each annulus as a function of time .",
    "the result will depend on the mass assumed for the massive galaxies and the time elapsed .",
    "our previous estimates show that , we can expect a significant evolution in the distribution of massive galaxies over a time scale of a few gyr for galaxies with @xmath65 m@xmath1 .",
    "we consider a cluster of mass @xmath58 m@xmath1 and concentration parameter @xmath31 . the virial radius for a cluster collapsing at @xmath4 is calculated to be @xmath66 mpc .",
    "the appropriate velocity dispersion for such a cluster is taken from the scaling observed in simulations by evrard ( 2008 ) to be @xmath67 cm s@xmath11 ( for hubble constant @xmath68 km / s / mpc ) ; we assume it to be independent of location inside the cluster , we consider massive galaxies with @xmath56 m@xmath1 and @xmath69 cm s@xmath11 .",
    "we show in figure 2 the initial mass distribution by dotted line ; it is a nfw mass profile with @xmath31 , for @xmath58 m@xmath1 collapsing at @xmath59 .",
    "we plot the radius as a fraction of @xmath70 .",
    "then , the mass distribution of an ensemble of galaxies with @xmath71 m@xmath1 is shown after @xmath72 and @xmath73 gyr with solid lines .",
    "it is found that the distribution steepens with time .",
    "the distribution at outer radii does change much , but massive galaxies in the middle region settles toward the center , increasing the density of these galaxies in the bins of radii in these regions .",
    "the dashed line shows a nfw profile with @xmath74 .",
    "all profiles have been drawn keeping the mass density at the outermost bin fixed in time , for comparison .",
    "= 0.5    -3 mm    we therefore find that the distribution of massive galaxies in a statistical ensemble of clusters steepens with time .",
    "the steepening depends on the assumed mass of the massive galaxies and the time elapsed . in our fiducial case of @xmath71 m@xmath1 immersed in a cluster of total mass @xmath75 m@xmath1 collapsing at @xmath59",
    ", we find that a distribution with initial @xmath31 has changed to a distribution with @xmath74 over a time scale @xmath76 gyr .",
    "it is interesting to compare this time scale with the cosmological lookback time .",
    "the look back time to redshift @xmath77 is @xmath78 gyr .",
    "if rich clusters formed at these redshifts , then their mass distribution would have settled into the nfw profile by that epoch . if such a cluster contained a few massive galaxies far from its center ,",
    "then it is conceivable that these massive galaxies would have spiralled toward the cluster center by the present epoch .",
    "lin & mohr ( 2007 ) have stacked the data from 188 clusters containing 16,646 radio loud objects ( with radio luminosity @xmath79 w hz@xmath11 ) to produce the density profile of these objects .",
    "the number of radio loud objects within the radius @xmath70 in their study was 836 .",
    "they found that the density profile corresponds to a nfw profile with @xmath80 , excluding the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) . with the inclusion of bcgs which they defined as radio loud objects within @xmath81 ,",
    "the profile steepens to @xmath82 .    the solid curve in figure 2 steepens further below a radius @xmath81 , and excluding this part ( equivalent to excluding the statistics of bcgs ) , we find that the density distribution is comparable to a nfw profile with @xmath83 , close to the observed value .",
    "it then appears the distribution of radio loud objects in the ensemble cluster ( produced by stacking the data of numerous clusters ) can be explained by assuming that the original mass distribution was a standard nfw profile with @xmath3 , and that massive galaxies slowly sink toward the cluster center owing to dynamical friction .",
    "the time taken to match the observed distribution is @xmath76 gyr if the massive galaxies have @xmath0 m@xmath1 , and belonging to a cluster of @xmath58 m@xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that lin & mohr ( 2007 ) have found that more powerful radio sources are more centrally concentrated than the weaker ones .",
    "for example , they found that radio sources with luminosity larger than @xmath84 w hz@xmath11 have a distribution comparable to a nfw profile with @xmath85 .",
    "this trend is expected in the above scenario if the probability of a galaxy to have a given radio luminosity increases with its total mass , which indeed seems to be the case .",
    "best ( 2005 ) found from the 2df survey data that the probability of a galaxy with a black hole mass @xmath86 to have radio power larger than a given value approximately scales as @xmath87 .",
    "if the central black hole mass scales linearly with the dynamical mass @xmath88 of the host galaxy as ( e.g. , hopkins 2007 ) , then one expects the hosts of more powerful radio sources to be more massive galaxies .",
    "we note here that dynamical friction can not be the complete story behind the concentration of radio loud objects in clusters .",
    "masses of galaxies alone do not determine their radio properties ; there are many factors that contribute to its radio luminosity , like mergers and interactions with other galaxies , and properties of the medium confining radio lobes . here",
    "we have isolated the dynamical aspect of the issue , and the results show that dynamical friction can also be as important as other factors in producing a steep density profile of radio sources in clusters .",
    "we study the dynamical friction of massive galaxies which can often be hosts of radio loud objects in galaxy clusters , and find the the time scale of mass segregation to be @xmath76 gyr , for galaxies of mass @xmath16 m@xmath1 within clusters of mass @xmath89 m@xmath1 .",
    "we show that this effect can help explain the observed distribution of radio loud objects in rich clusters of galaxies .",
