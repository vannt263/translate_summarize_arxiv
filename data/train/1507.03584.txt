    "the large - scale structure of the universe provides one of our most powerful tests of the cosmological model , encoding a wealth of information about the expansion history of the universe ( imprinted as a standard ruler in baryon acoustic oscillations ) and its gravitational physics ( inferred from the growth of structure with time ) .",
    "a central goal of modern cosmology is to map out this structure through galaxy redshift surveys , and to develop accurate models to link these observations to theory .    in the modelling of cosmological fluid dynamics , a particularly important role",
    "is played by the vector displacement field @xmath0 , which specifies the trajectory of fluid elements through space ( here denoted by a lagrangian co - ordinate @xmath1 ) and time @xmath2 . in modelling approaches such as lagrangian perturbation theory ,",
    "perturbative solutions may be formulated for @xmath3 and used to construct models for the statistics of the observed density field ( e.g.@xcite )    the displacement field has assumed particular importance in `` density - field reconstruction '' ( @xcite ) , a technique used to sharpen measurements of the baryon acoustic peak in the galaxy correlation function .",
    "measurements of the baryon acoustic peak , a preferred clustering scale imprinted in the distribution of photons and baryons by the propagation of sound waves in the relativistic plasma of the early universe ( @xcite ) , have assumed particular importance in recent years as a robust standard ruler to map out the cosmic expansion history ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the pristine sound - horizon scale imprinted in the high - redshift matter distribution is `` blurred '' by the bulk displacement of galaxies from their initial positions ( @xcite ) .",
    "reconstruction seeks to use the observed density field to estimate these displacements , for example using the zeldovitch approximation ( @xcite ) ( za ) , and hence retract galaxies to their near - original positions in the density field , restoring the sharp preferred separation .",
    "the technique has been successfully applied to datasets from the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) , the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( @xcite ) and the wigglez dark energy survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "a series of studies has considered the theory and implementation of density - field reconstruction .",
    "it may be formulated within lagrangian perturbation theory ( @xcite ) , to which the za is the lowest - order contribution , or by alternative perturbative schemes ( @xcite ) , or in fourier space ( @xcite ) .",
    "the method is robust to the treatment of the bias of the tracer or redshift - space effects ( @xcite ) , although room for improvement in the algorithm certainly exists ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a forensic study of the performance of the current reconstruction algorithm through comparison with the exact displacement field derived from particle - tracking in n - body simulations .",
    "first , we study the accuracy of the za using the initial matter velocity field with different hypotheses for the smoothing procedure and its sensitivity to the local density .",
    "this fiducial investigation is not affected by complications due to galaxy bias and non - linear effects on the estimated density field . using this to create an unbiased understanding of how proto - halo displacement is optimally modelled",
    ", we extend our results to the reconstruction of the displacement from the non - linear low - redshift halo density field .",
    "in particular , we study the error in the estimated displacements as a function of galaxy halo mass , redshift , filter and smoothing scale for estimating the density field .",
    "we also also study how this error depends on the order of perturbation theory applied , and local environment .",
    "we discuss the consequences of these results for the optimal measurement of the distance scale and the use of the displacement field to test cosmological models . for the purposes of this investigation , we neglect redshift - space distortions in the galaxy co - ordinates .    our paper is structured as follows : in section ii we review the connection between the displacement and density fields within lagrangian perturbation theory .",
    "we describe our methods for recovering the exact displacement field from n - body simulations , and the estimated displacement field from the initial simulation velocity field . in section iii",
    "we examine the performance of the density - field reconstruction algorithm , in particular focussing on the degradation of this performance with increasing local density . in section",
    "iv we suggest how the measured post - reconstruction correlation function can be `` re - weighted '' by environment to maximize the sharpness of the baryon acoustic peak , and we consider the level of improvement which may be obtained in the fitted distance scale . in section",
    "v we discuss the implications of our findings for the use of density - field reconstruction , and the displacement field itself , for testing cosmological models .",
    "in this section we briefly review lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) at first ( i.e. , za ) and second order ( i.e. , 2lpt ) .",
    "the displacement vector field @xmath3 links an initial ( lagrangian ) position @xmath1 of a mass element @xmath4 , smoothed on a scale @xmath5 , to the current ( eulerian ) position , @xmath6 in the za , @xmath3 is determined by the gradient of the gravitational potential @xmath7 , which can be expressed in terms of the linearly extrapolated density field . considering only the scalar contribution @xmath3 , at first and second order in the matter density field ,",
    "we have ( @xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the linear growth factor and the gravitational potential can be solved using the following poisson equations : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the linear density field smoothed on scale @xmath12 and @xmath13 .\\ ] ] the first order displacement ( @xmath14 term ) is the well - known za which can be expressed as a function of the initial peculiar velocity @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cosmic scale factor .",
    "the second order term has the label @xmath17 .",
    "the variance of the displacement field in the za is directly proportional to the initial matter power spectrum @xcite such that ( e.g.  for the @xmath18-component ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the linear matter power spectrum at initial redshift @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the fourier transform of the smoothing function .",
    "the higher orders of the displacement field can be expressed as higher - dimensional integrals @xcite .    in order to determine the accuracy of the za in various scenarios , we test two cases :    * case 1 : we use the proto - halo velocities to predict halo positions at @xmath23 assuming the za , and compare to the exact simulation displacement field ( see sec ii b , c ) . * case 2 : we use the halo density field at @xmath23 , and second order lpt , to reconstruct the displacement @xmath24 of halos , and compare to the exact simulation displacement field ( see sec iii ) .",
    "the first case extends the work of @xcite ( for the unsmoothed dark matter density field ) to the displacement of proto - halos .",
    "in particular , this analysis provides a physical insight of how proto - halos are displaced from their positions in the initial matter density field through cosmic time up to @xmath23 .",
    "we also extend these studies to investigate the sensitivity of the result to the smoothing scale and local environment , yielding useful comparisons with case 2 .",
    "the second case has a powerful application in the reconstruction of the baryon acoustic peak .",
    "previous studies have applied this method using first order lpt and found a low sensitivity to the smoothing scale @xmath12 which enters into eq.([2lptdisp],[poisson ] ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "we extend these tests to consider the effect of local environment and evaluate the gain of adding the 2lpt correction to reconstruct the displacement of halos .",
    "in particular , we will show how the second order correction depends on the choice of smoothing scale and environment .      in order to test the accuracy of the displacement field in cases 1 and 2",

    "these simulations were run for several scientific purposes described in @xcite .",
    "the box side of the simulations is @xmath25 mpc and they contain @xmath26 particles of mass @xmath27 .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the ramses code @xcite for a @xmath28cdm model calibrated to the wmap 5-year cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the halos were identified using the friend - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with linking length @xmath29 .    in what follows",
    "we will use the lagrangian size of halos @xmath30 where their mass is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mean matter density .",
    "we will approximate the shape of proto - halos to be spherical , with volume @xmath33 .",
    "we measured the position of the center of mass @xmath34 of all halos at @xmath23 . in order to measure the position of the proto - halos in the initial conditions , we labelled all particles which belong to a halo at @xmath23 and compute the center of mass @xmath35 for these particles in the initial conditions of the simulation",
    ". therefore we measured for each halo the exact displacement @xmath36 .",
    "the final position of a proto - halo at @xmath23 may be predicted from the initial velocity field according to eq.([velza ] ) .",
    "hence , the displacement of a mass element contained in a smoothing radius @xmath12 can be expressed as function of the average peculiar velocity initially contained in a patch of size @xmath12 , @xmath37 as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hubble parameter evaluated at the initial scale factor @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the linear growth rate . in this approximation",
    "we can use eq.([psi_zv ] ) to displace the proto - halos by measuring the average velocity @xmath42 around the center of mass @xmath43 and within a smoothing radius @xmath12 .",
    "we investigated the accuracy of the za in predicting the magnitude of @xmath44 .",
    "the smoothing scale @xmath12 is a free parameter in our investigation , used in the estimation of the local overdensity field . for @xmath45 the average velocity within the smoothed region tends to zero , and",
    "hence the proto - halos are not displaced . on the contrary , as @xmath46",
    "we obtain the displacement of individual particles , without considering that they belong to a halo .     measured in n - body simulations for two different halo masses ( black squares ) .",

    "as we can see , the mean displacement is not strongly sensitive to the mass of the proto - halos ( varying by only @xmath54 ) .",
    "however , the variance of the absolute displacement is reduced for large halos .",
    "physically , this is because larger proto - halos are less sensitive to the external shear field which contributes to the overall dynamics . in fig.([fig1 ] ) , we can also see the prediction of eq.([psi_zv ] ) ( plotted as histograms ) using different smoothing scales @xmath12 ( see legend ) when measuring the average peculiar velocities . for @xmath55 , the absolute displacement predicted by eq.([psi_zv ] )",

    "each environment is defined by the number density of halos inside a sphere of radius @xmath12 .",
    "we divide the halos into environment bins by considering the probability density function for the number of halos at @xmath23 within @xmath74 , in particular the mean @xmath78 and standard deviation @xmath79 of this distribution .",

    "we used both a top - hat filter and a gaussian filter , and we measured the error made in the zeldovitch prediction compared to the exact values for each component as a standard deviation @xmath90 .",
    "the result for the @xmath18-axis is shown in fig.([fig4 ] ) , other axes produced similar results .",

    "the performance of the reconstruction method becomes worse , since the number of neighbours becomes too small to reconstruct the density field with sufficient accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the higher order correction in eq.([2lptdisp ] ) becomes non - negligible when @xmath46 . for large smoothing scales ,",
    "the degradation from the optimal performance is a slow function of @xmath12 , consistent with the displacement being generated by large - wavelength modes that may be successfully recovered even in the presence of significant smoothing ( @xcite ) .",
    "these effects are illustrated in fig.([fig2lptall ] ) . using a gaussian filter",
    "we show the error made in the 1st - order ( black squares ) and 2lpt ( black crosses ) predictions for different smoothing scales .",

    "unsurprisingly , if we choose a large smoothing scale ( e.g.  @xmath99 mpc ) , the second order correction in eq.([2lptdisp ] ) is negligible . for a smaller smoothing scale ( e.g.  @xmath100 mpc )",

    "fig.([fig8 ] ) clearly displays a hierarchy where the baryon acoustic peak is sharper for the underdense regions and becomes more blurred for the high density regions .",

    "the increased sharpness of the post - reconstruction baryon acoustic peak in underdense environments could potentially be used to improve the accuracy of the standard ruler by upweighting those environments .",

    "however , given that the amplitude and shape of the correlation function are marginalized over in standard methods of fitting the preferred scale , this bias is not necessarily problematic if the acoustic peak itself is not shifted .      the total correlation function @xmath144 can be expressed as a function of the environmental correlation functions eq.([xi_ij ] ) .",

    "the conservation of the total number of pairs can be expressed as @xmath155 substituting eq.([conser ] ) into eq.([lsstand ] ) , we can express @xmath144 as function of the @xmath143 as @xmath156 where @xmath157 hence we have obtained an expression for the total correlation function in terms of @xmath143 .",
    "as a first illustration of the effect of assigning a different weight to different environments , we re - write @xmath143 in eq.([xitot ] ) as @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the weight assigned to each cross - correlation function in terms of weights @xmath160 defined for each environment @xmath161 . in the case",

    "we can see that weighting the underdense environment ( @xmath165 ) more than the overdense environment ( @xmath124 ) allows us to recover the linear ( sharpest ) amplitude of the bao peak .",

    "we used 5 different environments and @xmath108 mpc .",
    "we observe that the hierarchy of the @xmath186 is not as simple as we show in fig.([xitotw1 ] ) . with this parametrization ,",
    "the standard reconstruction ( black line , @xmath187 ) is closer to the linear correlation function than the measurement obtained assigning higher weight to the underdense environments ( blue and light - blue lines ) owing to the amplitude bias introduced by the weighting .",
    "however , the sharpness of the acoustic peak is nonetheless increased by such a weighting scheme . in the next section",
    "we consider the implications for the recovered standard ruler scale .      in order to determine the accuracy of the recovered distance scale , we fit a simple baryon acoustic peak model to the galaxy correlation functions measured from each n - body realization , using the distribution of measurements across the realizations as the covariance matrix .",
    "our fiducial correlation function model is based on a fourier - transform of a model linear power spectrum @xmath188 : @xmath189 .\\ ] ] we constructed the model power spectrum using a transfer function from the eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) fitting formulae , assuming the fiducial cosmological parameters of the wizcola simulations .",
    "we then fit for the scale distortion parameter @xmath190 , marginalizing over a normalization factor @xmath191 : @xmath192 this approximate model is adequate for our purposes of exploring the relative accuracy of determining @xmath190 ; we verified that a series of model extensions , such as using a model power spectrum from camb , or marginalizing over an additive scale - free polynomial or a free damping parameter , or using the mock mean correlation function as a template , did not qualitatively change our conclusions .",
    "we quantified the standard ruler performance by the standard deviation of the best - fitting values of @xmath190 across the realizations , which we denote by @xmath193 .",
    "for this particular test we used the 1000 single - box cola realizations and 12 environments , checking that our conclusions were not sensitive to these choices .    in order to test any improvement brought by the new concepts developed in the previous sections",
    ", we defined as a reference level the results obtained by a standard reconstruction method using the zeldovitch approximation , smoothing length @xmath108 mpc , and no weighting ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "similar assumptions are used in standard implementations such as ( @xcite ) . using the measurements of @xmath193",
    ", we computed the relative difference @xmath194 between the reference model and the results obtained ( a ) changing the smoothing length , ( b ) adding the 2lpt correction and ( c ) introducing weighting of environments as a function of @xmath18 .    in fig.([fig9 ] ) we display our results for this analysis , in the form of the relative difference @xmath194 as function of the weighting parameter @xmath18 defined by eq.([wieq ] ) .",
    "the solid line uses the reconstruction method with the zeldovitch approximation and @xmath108 mpc , the blue short dashed line shows the result for 2lpt and @xmath122 mpc while the red dashed line shows 2lpt and @xmath100 mpc .     in eq.([wieq ] ) which controls the relative weight assigned to underdense and overdense regions .",
    "the reference case is the za with @xmath108 mpc and no weighting . ]",
    "we find that the environmental - dependent weighting produces a small but measurable improvement in @xmath193 ( @xmath195 ) , with best performance usually produced in the range @xmath196 .",
    "the implementation of 2lpt for computing the displacement field also produces a benefit as judged by @xmath193 , such that the total improvement is @xmath197 .",
    "we summarize the conclusions of our study as follows :    * the displacement of proto - halos can be predicted with high accuracy by the za using their peculiar velocities . in this case ,",
    "eq.([psi_zv ] ) evaluated at @xmath74 provides a very good description of the displacement field with accuracy @xmath198 mpc , independently of the halo masses .",
    "the choice of the smoothing scale is important , since there is a unique scale for which the approximation gives the best agreement with the exact final positions of the halos .",
    "the error in each component of @xmath3 follows a gaussian distribution centered on zero with a variance sensitive to the smoothing scale and the environment of the halos .",
    "* when reconstruction of the displacement field is performed using the @xmath23 halo distribution in real space , we likewise find that the accuracy depends significantly on the smoothing scale and environment .",
    "we extended the za to 2lpt and established a link between the error in predicting the displacement field and the local density around halos . *",
    "based on this result , we showed that after applying reconstruction , the baryon acoustic peak is sharper in the correlation function of low - density environments .",
    "we hence built a new estimator of the correlation function , constructed by weighting a set of auto- and cross - correlation functions measured between different environments .",
    "* fitting a bao model to the results , we found a small but measurable improvement of @xmath197 in determining the standard ruler scale through a combination of using 2lpt to find the displacement field and weighting the environmental correlation functions .",
    "further improvements may be possible using more sophisticated weighting schemes .    the fact that the reconstruction of the displacement field using the halo density distribution at @xmath199 is @xmath200",
    "times less accurate than the za applied to the initial velocities of proto - halos ( independently of the orders considered in the lpt approximation ) implies that the measurement of the error @xmath201 contains non - linear information which could potentially be sensitive to different cosmological models , especially in high - density environments .",
    "the evolution in time of the environmental correlation functions should carry this non - linear information and can be use to test non - standard cosmologies .",
    "for instance in fig.([figbfaf ] ) , the correlation function before reconstruction in high - density environments has a smeared bao peak compared to that of the lowest density environment",
    ". the ratio of the bao peak widths in those two environments should be directly proportional to the degree of late time non - linear interactions . for non - standard cosmologies",
    ", this ratio might be different ( e.g. , fewer non - linear interactions for early dark energy models ) .",
    "we will investigate these topics further in future work .",
    "we warmly thank y. rasera for providing easy access to the deus simulations@xcite .",
    "we are also grateful to jun koda for generating the wizcola simulation suite used in this investigation .",
