    "squeezing and displacement are the basic operations of continuous variables quantum information @xcite , and are easily performed , the former by parametric amplifiers , the latter by lasers and linear optics . squeezing in the two - mode setup",
    "is , for example , the tool to generate entanglement in the braunstein - kimble teleportation scheme @xcite .",
    "the combined use of real squeezing and displacement allows one to encode efficiently classical information in quantum channels using homodyne detection at the receiver @xcite . in a quantum communication scenario where a coherent signal is sent through a non - linear medium and",
    "undergoes an amplification process , the joint estimation of displacement and squeezing provides a twofold information : the amplitude modulation of the state and a property of the communication channel itself .",
    "this may be useful in a communication scheme designed to be robust to photon loss .",
    "in this paper we consider the problem of jointly estimating real amplitude and real squeezing of the radiation field . in a tomographic setup ,",
    "where a large number of equally prepared copies is available , the maximum likelihood method turns out to be very efficient in estimating the parameters that characterize the state of the quantum system @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "first one fixes a set of single - copy measurements ( typically homodyne measurements at some random phase ) and then looks for the estimate that maximizes the probability ( density ) of producing the observed data .",
    "however , the tomographic approach is not suitable to the case when only a small number of copies is available , and one needs to use the limited resources at disposal more efficiently .",
    "it becomes then important to optimize not only the posterior processing of the experimental data , but also the choice of the measurement that is used to extract these data from the system .",
    "the most natural framework to deal with this situation is quantum estimation theory @xcite , where the concept of positive operator valued measure ( povm ) provides a tool to describe at the same time both measurement and data processing .",
    "the maximum likelihood approach in quantum estimation theory @xcite then corresponds to seek the measurement that maximizes the probability ( density ) that the estimated value of the parameters coincides with the true value .",
    "joint estimation of squeezing and displacement is equivalent to infer an unknown transformation of a group  in the present case the affine group .",
    "this is an example of a frequent situation in quantum estimation , especially in communication problems , where a set of signal states is generated from a fixed input state by the action of a group .",
    "consider , for example , the case of phase estimation for high - sensitivity interferometry and optimal clocks @xcite , the estimation of rotation for the optimal alignment of reference frames @xcite , and the estimation of displacement of the radiation field for the detection of a coherent signal in gaussian noise @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the symmetry of the problem provides a physical insight that allows one to simplify the search for efficient estimation strategies , and the concept of _ covariant _ measurement @xcite becomes crucial for optimization .",
    "the use of maximum likelihood approach in the covariant setting has been shown to be particularly successful in obtaining explicitly the optimal measurements and in understanding the fundamental mechanism that leads to the ultimate sensitivity of quantum measurements @xcite .",
    "group theoretical tools , such as equivalent representations @xcite and multiplicity spaces @xcite , far from being abstract technicalities , are the main ingredients to achieve the ultimate quantum limits for sensitivity @xcite . moreover , in a large number of situations , the maximization of the likelihood provides measurements that are optimal also according to a wide class of different figures of merit @xcite .    from a group theoretical point of view",
    ", the action of real squeezing and displacement on the wavefunctions provides a unitary representation of the affine group `` @xmath0 '' of dilations and translations on the real line .",
    "the structure of the affine group underlies the theory of wavelets @xcite , and has been recently used in the characterization of @xmath1 coherent states @xcite , and in the study of oscillators in a morse potential @xcite .",
    "the affine group is particularly interesting , since it is the paradigmatic example of a nonunimodular group , namely a group where the left - invariant haar measure is different from the right - invariant one .",
    "this leads to orthogonality relations that  differently from the usual schur lemmas ",
    "involve a positive unbounded operator , firstly introduced by duflo , moore , and carey ( dmc ) in ref . @xcite .",
    "as we will see in this paper , the nonunimodularity of the group has some amazing consequences in the estimation problem .",
    "for example , the so - called square - root measurements @xcite , that are commonly considered in quantum communication and cryptography , do not coincide with the maximum - likelihood measurements , the latter providing a higher probability density of correct estimation .",
    "another bizarre feature is that for maximum likelihood measurements , the most likely value in the probability distribution can be different from the true one .",
    "while for unimodular groups this feature never happens , for nonunimodular groups it is unavoidable , and a suitable choice of the input states is needed to reduce the discrepancy between the true value and the most likely one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in order to set the optimal joint estimation of real squeezing and displacement in the general estimation method ,",
    "first we derive in sec .",
    "[ mlest ] the optimal measurement for the problem of estimating the unknown unitary action of a nonunimodular group . then , as a special example , the general results will be used to optimize the joint estimation of squeezing and displacement in sec .",
    "[ jointest ] .",
    "the efficiency of coherent states and displaced squeezed states is analyzed in detail , and the asymptotic relation between the uncertainties in the joint estimation and the uncertainties in the optimal separate measuremnts of squeezing and displacement is derived .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the explicit derivation of group average over the affine group is given in the appendix .",
    "suppose that a fixed input state @xmath2 , corresponding to a density operator in the hilbert space @xmath3 , is transformed by the unitary representation @xmath4 of the group @xmath5 , so that it generates the family of signal states @xmath6 the typical quantum estimation problem is then to find the measurement that gives the best estimate for the unknown transformation @xmath7 according to some optimality criterion .",
    "usually the criterion is given by a cost function @xmath8 , which quantifies the cost of estimating @xmath9 when the true value is @xmath7 , and enjoys the invariance property @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the maximum likelihood criterion corresponds to the delta cost - function @xmath11 ( loosely speaking , there is an infinite gain if the estimate coincides with the true value , and no gain otherwise ) .",
    "once a cost function is fixed , one can choose two possible approaches to optimization , namely the bayes approach and the minimax .",
    "in the bayes approach , one assumes some prior distribution of the unknown parameters , and then minimizes the average over the true values of the expected cost @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the conditional probability density of estimating @xmath9 when the true value is @xmath7 . in the minimax approach ,",
    "one looks instead for the measurement that minimizes the supremum of the expected cost over all possible true values of the unknown parameters .",
    "an important class of estimation strategies is given by the _",
    "measurements , that are described by povms of the form @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an operator satisfying the normalization condition @xmath16 @xmath17 denoting the left - invariant haar measure on the group , namely . due to the symmetry of the set of states ( [ orbit ] ) , covariant measurements play a fundamental role in the search of the optimal estimation . for compact groups ,",
    "the following proposition holds :    [ covminimax ] for compact groups , the search for the optimal measurement in the minimax approach can be restricted without loss of generality to the class of covariant measurements .",
    "moreover , for compact groups the optimality of covariant measurements holds also in the bayes approach @xcite , if the prior distribution is chosen to be the normalized haar measure on the group , i.e. the measure @xmath18 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    for non - compact groups , such as the affine group involved in the joint estimation of squeezing and displacement , the situation is more involved",
    "of course , in the bayes approach it is no longer possible to choose the uniform haar measure as prior distribution , since it is not normalizable .",
    "however , in the minimax the optimality of covariant measurements still holds , even though in this case the proof becomes rather technical @xcite . in this paper we will adopt the minimax approach to deal with noncompact groups , and this will allow us to restrict the optimization to covariant povms .",
    "as we will see in section iii , the action of real squeezing and displacement on one mode of the radiation field yields a representation of the affine group `` @xmath0 '' of dilations and translations on the real line .",
    "this group is clearly non - compact , and , moreover , it is nonunimodular , namely the left - invariant haar measure @xmath17 ( with @xmath21 ) does not coincide with the right - invariant one @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore , to face the estimation problem with the affine group , we need some results about representation theory and orthogonality relations for nonunimodular groups ( for an introduction to these topics , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath24 be a unitary representation of a locally compact group @xmath5 .",
    "in the following , we will make two assumptions on the representation @xmath25 that are tailored on the concrete problem of estimating real squeezing and displacement .    _",
    "first assumption : discrete clebsch - gordan series .",
    "_ we require the representation @xmath25 to be a direct sum of irreducible representations ( _ irreps _ ) , namely that its clebsch - gordan series is discrete . in this case , there is a decomposition of the hilbert space @xmath26 as @xmath27 such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an irreducible representation acting on the hilbert space @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the identity in the space @xmath32 .",
    "the hilbert spaces @xmath30 and @xmath33 are called _ representation _ and _ multiplicity _ spaces , respectively , and the index @xmath34 labels the inequivalent irreps that appear in the clebsch - gordan series @xmath35 of the representation @xmath25 .    _",
    "second assumption : square - summable irreps .",
    "_ we require each irreducible representation @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ repdecomp ] ) to be square - summable .",
    "this means that there is at least one non - zero vector @xmath37 such that @xmath38 vectors such that the above integral converges are called _ admissible_. it is possible to show @xcite that , if a representation is square - summable , then the set of admissible vectors is dense in the hilbert space .",
    "let us consider now the group average of an operator @xmath39 , defined as @xmath40 in general , the average may not converge for any operator ( for example , it diverges for @xmath41 ) . in analogy with admissible vectors",
    ", we say that @xmath39 is an _ admissible operator _ if the group average in eq .",
    "( [ defave ] ) converges in the weak operator sense .",
    "in such a case , one can prove that @xmath42 is given by @xmath43~,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a positive self - adjoint operator acting on the representation space @xmath30 .",
    "the operator @xmath44 has been firstly introduced by duflo , moore , and carey ( dmc ) @xcite , and is the characteristic feature of nonunimodular groups .",
    "in fact , if the group @xmath5 is unimodular  i.e .",
    "if the left- and right - invariant measures coincide  than the dmc operator is simply a multiple of the identity , and the formula ( [ aveop ] ) for the group average is equivalent to the ordinary schur lemmas .",
    "contrarily , if the group @xmath5 is nonunimodular , the dmc operator is a positive unbounded operator , and its presence modifies the orthogonality relations dramatically , with remarkable consequences in the estimation of an unknown group transformation .",
    "the admissibility of vectors and operators has a simple characterization in terms of the dmc operator .",
    "as regards vectors , the set of admissible vectors for the irrep @xmath29 can be characterized as the domain of @xmath45 . for unimodular groups , since @xmath44 is proportional to the identity , the set of admissible vectors is the whole representation space @xmath30 , while for nonunimodular groups the admissible vectors form a dense subset of @xmath30 . as regards operators , an operator @xmath39 is admissible if and only if the partial traces @xmath46 $ ] are not diverging .",
    "for example , if @xmath37 is an admissible vector and @xmath47 is any operator acting on @xmath33 , then the operator @xmath48 is admissible , and its group average is @xmath49 .      in order to find the best estimate for the signal states ( [ orbit ] ) according to the maximum likelihood criterion in the minimax approach , we consider now a covariant measurement , described by a povm @xmath50 as in eq .",
    "( [ covpovm ] ) . the normalization condition ( [ nc ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath51    using eq .",
    "( [ aveop ] ) for evaluating the group average @xmath52 , this condition becomes @xmath53= \\openone_{\\spc m_{\\mu}}~.\\ ] ]    according to the maximum likelihood approach , we need to find the covariant measurement that maximizes the probability density that the estimated transformation coincides with the true one , i.e. @xmath54=\\tr[\\xi \\rho]$ ] . for a pure input state @xmath55 , the maximization of the likelihood over all possible operators @xmath15 satisfying the constraints ( [ trxi ] ) follows in a simple way by a repeated use of schwartz inequality .",
    "in fact , the input state @xmath56 can be written in the decomposition ( [ spacedecomp ] ) as @xmath57 is a bipartite state . from schwartz inequality",
    ", we have @xmath58 at this point , we assume that each bipartite state @xmath59 is in the domain of the operator @xmath60 .",
    "this assumption is not restrictive , since the domain of a self - adjoint operator is dense in the hilbert space . in this way , it is possible to write and to exploit the schmidt decomposition of the ( non - normalized ) vector @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , we can write @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the schmidt rank , @xmath64 are schmidt coefficients such that @xmath65 , and latexmath:[$|\\tilde \\psi^{\\mu}_m\\ > ,    @xmath30 and @xmath33 , respectively",
    ". the form ( [ bipartitemu ] ) is very convenient for optimization , in fact we can use again schwartz inequality and obtain @xmath67 finally , we have @xmath68~|\\tilde\\phi_m^{\\mu}\\>=1~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equality following from the normalization constraint ( [ trxi ] ) .",
    "therefore , the previous chain of inequalities proves the upper bound @xmath69 that holds for any covariant povm . on the other hand , it is immediate to check that the bound is achieved by the covariant povm given by @xmath70 with @xmath71 denoting the argument of a complex number , i.e. @xmath72 . the normalization of such a povm follows from eq .",
    "( [ trxi ] ) , and one has @xmath73 namely , the povm is complete in the subspace spanned by the orbit of @xmath74 , and can be trivially completed to the whole hilbert space without affecting the probability distribution .",
    "notice that , if the group @xmath5 is unimodular , namely @xmath75 for some positive constant @xmath76 , then we correctly retrieve the results of ref .",
    "@xcite about maximum - likelihood measurements .    _",
    "the case of @xmath25 being a direct sum of inequivalent irreps . _ the expression for the optimal covariant povm can be further simplified in the case when all the multiplicity spaces @xmath33 are one - dimensional , i.e. when the representation @xmath25 is a direct sum of inequivalent irreps . in this case",
    ", we can decompose the input state as @xmath77 ( as in eq .",
    "( [ statedecomp ] ) , but without the need of introducing bipartite states ) , and now the decomposition ( [ bipartitemu ] ) becomes trivial , namely @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 therefore , eq . ( [ opteta ] ) for the optimal povm becomes @xmath81 and the corresponding optimal likelihood is given by @xmath82      _ remark 1 : square - root measurements .",
    "_ a possible strategy to estimate an unknown quantum state , randomly drawn from a given family , is given by the so - called square - root measurements ( srm ) , firstly introduced by hausladen and wootters @xcite .",
    "in the case of pure states with a group symmetry as in eq .",
    "( [ orbit ] ) , there is an important connection between srm and maximum - likelihood measurements .",
    "for example , if the group @xmath5 is a discrete group of phase shifts , it has been proved in refs .",
    "@xcite , that srm minimize the probability of error in estimating the unknown state , and , equivalently , they maximize the likelihood , i.e. the probability of correct estimation . more generally , the optimality of the srm in the maximum likelihood approach has been proved in ref .",
    "@xcite for a large class of groups , including all finite groups , all compact groups , and unimodular noncompact groups , such as the weyl - heisenberg group of displacements .",
    "however , as we will see in the following , the case of nonunimodular groups represents an exception to the fact that srm are optimal for the maximum likelihood criterion in the presence of a physical symmetry .",
    "in fact , the srm for the estimation of a group transformation acting on a fixed state @xmath2 is given by the povm @xmath83 , where @xmath84 ( the povm @xmath85 is obviously normalized with respect to the left - invariant measure @xmath17 ) .",
    "the comparison with the maximum - likelihood measurements of the previous section is particularly simple in the case of group representations @xmath25 that are direct sum of inequivalent irreps .",
    "in fact , for a pure state @xmath86 with @xmath87 ) , namely @xmath88 .",
    "notice here that the square - root measurement can be defined only if @xmath89 is in the domain of @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the square - root measurement is given by the covariant povm @xmath91 this covariant povm is different from the optimal one given in ( [ optetaineq ] ) , and does not achieve the optimal value ( [ optlikineq ] ) for the likelihood .",
    "when @xmath92 is in the domain of both @xmath90 and @xmath93 , we can compare the values of the likelihood as follows .",
    "one has @xmath94 where we used the inequality @xmath95 , from schwartz inequality applied to the vectors @xmath96 $ ] for the optimal povm achieves its maximum at the value @xmath97 .",
    "again , this is true for unimodular groups , but fails to hold for nonunimodular groups .",
    "let the group @xmath5 be unimodular . if the covariant povm @xmath98 maximizes the likelihood for a given input state @xmath2 , then the probability distribution @xmath13 of the estimate @xmath9 on the state @xmath99 achieves its maximum for @xmath97 .",
    "suppose that the most likely value does not coincide with the true one .",
    "then we can rigidly shift the whole probability distribution with a post - processing operation that brings the most likely value to the true one .",
    "in fact , if the maximum of @xmath13 occurs at @xmath100 , we can always replace @xmath101 with a new covariant povm @xmath102 , where @xmath103 the normalization of the new povm follows from the fact that for unimodular groups the dmc operators are trivially proportional to the identity , and therefore the operator @xmath104 satisfy the normalization constraints ( [ trxi ] ) as well .",
    "moreover , the probability distribution @xmath105 associated with @xmath106 enjoys the property @xmath107 , whence it achieves the maximum in @xmath97 . in this way",
    ", the likelihood of @xmath106 would be higher than the likelihood of the povm @xmath101 .",
    "but this can not happen since @xmath101 is the optimal maximum - likelihood povm",
    ". therefore @xmath13 must be maximum in @xmath97 .    for nonunimodular groups the previous argument does not apply , since the povm given by ( [ xiprime ] ) is no longer normalized .",
    "in fact , the operator @xmath104 does not satisfy the normalization constraints ( [ trxi ] ) , since the dmc operators do not commute with the unitaries @xmath108 .",
    "in other words , we are not allowed to bring the most likely value to coincide with the true one by rigidly shifting the whole probability distribution . as we will see in the explicit example of the estimation of real squeezing and displacement",
    ", this situation can indeed happen . in order to reduce the discrepancy between the true value and the most likely one ,",
    "a suitable choice of the input states is needed .",
    "for example , in the simple case of @xmath25 being a direct sum of inequivalent irreps , if the projection of the input state onto the irreducible subspaces are eigenvectors of the dmc operators , then the most likely value coincides with the true one .",
    "in fact , for any input state @xmath109 , using schwarz inequality , we have @xmath110 and if each @xmath111 is eigenvector of @xmath44 , then the last expression is equal to @xmath112 , then the true value is the most likely one .",
    "in the following we will apply the general framework of section [ mlest ] to the case of joint estimation of real squeezing and displacement of a single - mode radiation field with bosonic operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 with @xmath115=1 $ ] . given the wavefunction of a pure state @xmath116 in the @xmath117-representation @xmath118 , where @xmath119 denotes the dirac - normalized eigenstate of the quadrature operator @xmath120 , the affine transformation on the real line given by @xmath121",

    "the operators    @xmath126    provide a unitary representation of the affine group in the hilbert space of wavefunctions .",
    "the affine group is nonunimodular , and in the above parametrization the left- and right - invariant measures are given by @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , respectively .      in order to exploit the general results of sec .",
    "[ mlest ] , we need to know the clebsch - gordan decomposition of the representation @xmath129 , the irreducible subspaces , and the dmc operators . all these informations are given in the following , while the proof is presented in the appendix .",

    "the probability distribution for the joint estimation of squeezing and displacement on the vacuum state and on a coherent state with @xmath160 has been reported in figs . 1 and 2 , respectively . comparing the two figures , a remarkable improvement in the precision of the measurement can be observed as an enhancement of the likelihood , along with a narrowing of the probability distribution .",

    "we notice that only a small fraction of order @xmath198 of the total number of photons @xmath199 comes from squeezing . since one has @xmath200 , the convergence to the asymptotic regime is quite slow : the uncertainty goes to zero with order @xmath201 . as an example in the asymptotic regime , in fig .",
    "3 we plot the exact probability distribution for @xmath202 .",
    "( with signal photons @xmath203 , and squeezing photons @xmath198 ) . ]",
    "also for displaced squeezed states one can compare the accuracy of the joint estimation with that of independent measurements of squeezing and displacement .",
    "for squeezed states of the form ( [ dispsqueez ] ) the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable @xmath117 is @xmath204 . on the other hand , the optimal estimation of squeezing",
    "is obtained asymptotically by the observable @xmath205 , and its uncertainty is @xmath206 ( according to the results of @xcite ) .",
    "again , a factor @xmath207 relates the standard deviations of the marginals in the joint estimation with those of the optimal separate measurements .",
    "again , we find the relation ( [ uncprod ] ) between the product of uncertainties .",
    "we then see that the estimation of real squeezing and displacement on input states of the form ( [ dispsqueez ] ) corresponds in the asymptotic regime to the joint measurement of the observables @xmath117 and @xmath208 , whose commutator is @xmath209=i/(2 y)$ ]  .",
    "we thus have the heisenberg - robertson inequality @xmath210 where @xmath211 denotes the expectation value . from this point of view ,",
    "the displaced squeezed states ( [ dispsqueez ] ) are characterized asymptotically as minimum uncertainty states , since they saturate the inequality , and the product of uncertainties in the maximum likelihood estimation is exactly twice the heisenberg limit . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the present case is the first example of joint measurement of two harmonic - oscillator noncommuting observables whose commutator is not a @xmath212-number .",
    "the results presented in the previous sections can be easily extended to include the estimation of the reflection on the real line that is realized by the parity operator @xmath213 . in this case",
    "we are interested in estimating the three parameters in the transformation @xmath214 where @xmath215 can assume the values @xmath216 or @xmath217 .",
    "the representation @xmath218 is now irreducible in @xmath3 , and the associated dmc operator is @xmath219 . for a given input state @xmath56 , the optimal povm can be written as @xmath220 , where @xmath221 according to eq .",
    "( [ optetaineq ] ) . clearly , also in this case it is possible to enhance the sensitivity of detection by increasing the average value of the modulus @xmath155 , using coherent states or displaced squeezed states .",
    "a fundamental mechanism leading to the optimal estimation of group transformations is the use of equivalent representations of the group , via the technique of entanglement between representation spaces and multiplicity @xcite .",
    "such a strategy strongly improves the quality of estimation for unimodular groups @xcite , and in the case of compact groups is a way to obtain the best estimation of a unitary transformation@xcite .",
    "equivalent representations of the affine group can be obtained by entangling the radiation with a second reference mode , which is not affected by the unknown squeezing and displacement .",
    "this corresponds to considering the two - mode hilbert space @xmath222 and the representation @xmath223 of the affine group , namely the reference mode plays the role of an infinite dimensional multiplicity space . in this case",
    ", the optimal estimation can be obtained with the povm specified by the general formula ( [ opteta ] ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of the two - mode setup is that it is possible to have an _ orthogonal _",
    "povm for the estimation , namely there exists an ordinary observable on the extended hilbert space , associated with the joint measurement of squeezing and displacement .",
    "in fact , by defining the bipartite vectors @xmath224 we can construct the orthogonal povm @xmath225 the normalization follows straightforwardly from eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have the orthogonality relation @xmath226 where we used eq .",
    "( [ dsr ] ) of the appendix and the identity @xmath227 .",
    "the vectors in eq .",
    "( [ pointer ] ) are not normalizable . however , similarly to the case of the heterodyne operator , where physical states can arbitrarily well approximate the unnormalizable eigenstates @xcite , here one can consider , e.g. , states of the form @xmath228 is a normalization constant , and @xmath229 is the photon number operator for the auxiliary mode @xmath230 .",
    "the states @xmath231 approaches the optimal vectors ( [ pointer ] ) as @xmath232 , with a correspondent increasing to infinity of the average energy of the radiation field .",
    "in this paper we presented the joint estimation of real squeezing and displacement of the radiation field from the general point of view of group parameter estimation .",
    "the combination of squeezing and displacement provides a representation of the affine group `` @xmath233 '' , which is the paradigmatic example of a nonunimodular group . to deal with the concrete example of squeezing and displacement , we derived in the maximum likelihood approach the optimal estimation of a group transformation in the case of nonunimodular groups , providing explicitly the optimal povm for a given input state . in this analysis",
    ", some remarkable features of estimation showed up .",
    "firstly , while for unimodular groups the maximum likelihood measurements coincide with the usual square - root measurements , for nonunimodular groups the srm are no longer optimal , namely they do not maximize the probability density of detecting the correct value .",
    "moreover , for nonunimodular groups one can optimize the estimation strategy in the maximum likelihood approach , but even for the optimal povm the true value is not the one which is most likely to be detected . to reduce the discrepancy between the true value and the most likely one a suitable choice of the input states is required .",
    "both these features are in general unavoidable , and their origin tracks back to the presence of a positive unbounded operator  the duflo - moore - carey operator  in the orthogonality relations for nonunimodular groups . in the problem of joint estimating real squeezing and displacement , all the above effects occur .",
    "in particular , for coherent input states and displaced squeezed states we observed how an increase in the expectation value of @xmath155 gives rise to an improvement in the quality of estimation , along with a reduction of the discrepancy between the true value and the most likely one .",
    "in the mentioned cases the probability distributions for joint estimation become asymptotically gaussian , and the r.m.s .",
    "errors @xmath234 and @xmath235 can be easily calculated .",
    "remarkably , the product of uncertainties in the joint estimation is exactly twice the product of uncertainties for the optimal separate measurements of squeezing and displacement , in the same way as in the joint measurement of two conjugated quadratures .",
    "finally , the use of entanglement with an additional mode of the radiation field allows one to perform a von neumann measurement for the joint estimation of squeezing and displacement , in terms of an ordinary observable with continuous spectrum .",
    "the ideal input states for detecting an unknown affine transformation can then be approximated by normalizable states .",

    "here we derive the group theoretical structure of the representation @xmath236 of the affine group , by explicitly calculating the expression for the group average of an operator @xmath39 over the left - invariant measure @xmath237 .",
    "the clebsch - gordan series of @xmath129 contains two irreducible irreps , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "accordingly , the hilbert space can be decomposed as @xmath238 , and the projections onto the irreducible subspaces are @xmath239 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
