    "quantum entanglement is one of surprising consequences of quantum mechanics .",
    "it lies in the center of attention since the famous paper by einstein , podolsky , and rosen@xcite ( epr ) .",
    "two ( or more ) subsystems are entangled if the system as a whole is characterized by a wave function or a density matrix , which can not be presented in the form of products of subsystems wave functions or density matrices @xcite . in some cases entanglement ( for example bell states )",
    "leads to complete determinacy of the combined bipartite system while states of the subsystems are fully undetermined .",
    "entanglement is the key element of such phenomena and domains of modern quantum optics as quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , bell violation experiments , quantum computation .    a special class of entangled systems ,",
    "attracting a permanently growing attention , is that of systems with continuous variables . the most often and widely studied example is spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "some questions arising in discussions of entanglement in such systems are how high is the entanglement in a given multipartite state , what is the best measure of the degree of entanglement , how the degree of entanglement can be measured experimentally , etc . , etc .",
    "it s rather well recognized @xcite that in the case of pure bipartite states the degree of their entanglement can be characterized by the so called schmidt number @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the schmidt number definition does not provide any recipes on how it could be measured .",
    "an alternative approach @xcite to the entanglement characterization is based on analysis of conditional and unconditional probability density distributions , which are related directly to experimentally measurable coincidence and single - particle wave packets of particles . specifically , it was suggested @xcite to characterize the degree of entanglement by the ratios @xmath1 or @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the single - particle @xmath5 and coincidence @xmath6 coordinate and momentum wave packet widths , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the coordinate and momentum variables of one of two particles under consideration . as it was shown @xcite , @xmath9 for a rater general class of double - gaussian bipartite wave functions @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are continuous variables of two particles , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are constants .",
    "physical meaning of these parameters is determined by a problem under consideration .",
    "there are problems in which a double - gaussian bipartite wave function arises quite naturally .",
    "one example of such a phenomenon is the strong - field electron - positron pair production @xcite . in some other processes and phenomena the arising bipartite wave functions",
    "are not double - gaussian but can be successfully modeled by double - gaussian functions with appropriately chosen parameters . in these cases",
    "the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are usually close if not equal to each other . and",
    ", finally , if a bipartite wave function has a form strongly different from the double - gaussian one , all three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 can differ from each other .",
    "we assume that in such a case each of these parameters characterizes the degree of entanglement to be seen in different ways , and entanglement itself can not be characterized completely by any single universal parameter .",
    "note that for non - entangled states @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , for non - entangled states coincidence and single wave packets are identical to each other .",
    "any differences between the coincidence and single wave packets can be considered as a manifestation of entanglement .",
    "macroscopic characteristics of these differences are given just by the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath0 .",
    "if these parameters differ from each other , the largest of them indicates an optimal way of observing entanglement experimentally or calculating mathematically , whereas in other ways of measurements or calculations entanglement can be hidden .",
    "also , one can characterize the degree of entanglement by the epr - related parameter given by the inverse coordinate and momentum conditional uncertainties or wave packet widths for any given particle : @xmath22 $ ] @xcite . for non - entangled states a specific value of this parameter depends on the definition of widths and on the shape of single - particle wave functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the product of which",
    "gives the non - entangled bipartite wave function .",
    "if the widths are determined as square roots of variances ( as in the work @xcite ) , and the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are gaussian , the no - entanglement value of the epr - related parameter is given by @xmath25 .",
    "if the widths @xmath26 and @xmath27 are determined as the widths of the corresponding probability distribution curves at the half - maximum level ( as in this work ) , for the same forms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in terms of the epr - related parameter @xmath31 , the degree of entanglement for non - factorized bipartite functions is evaluated as @xmath32 .",
    "it is assumed usually that deviations of realistic bipartite wave functions from the double - gaussian one [ eq .",
    "( [ double - gaussian ] ) ] do not give rise to any pronounced new features of the processes under consideration and , in particular , all the entanglement parameters remain of the same order of magnitude if not equal identically .",
    "in contrast to this assumption , we show below that , in the case of spdc , deviations of the biphoton wave function ( to be found below ) from the double - gaussian one are well pronounced and they can change drastically the observable wave packet pictures . owing to this",
    ", the spdc entanglement phenomenon appears to be essentially multiparametric , with the above - indicated parameters significantly differing from each other .    concerning the observable biphoton wave packet pictures , formulated explicitly or",
    "not , the usual notion is that they are more or less invariant with respect to rotations around the pump laser axis .",
    "in contrast to this , we show that the spdc biphotons are strongly anisotropic and the degree of anisotropy depends essentially on relative orientation of a crystal and the observation direction .",
    "furthermore , usually the biphoton momentum wave packet structure is supposed to be controlled by the laser pump angular distribution and by geometrical factors like crystal shape etc . @xcite .",
    "that is why it seems that in order to generate well - localized biphoton wave packets in the @xmath8-domain one has to use good laser sources with a very small angular divergency and/or long crystals . at the same time forming particular angular profile of the pump is needed for coupling biphotons into the optical fibers @xcite , that is very important for some applications .",
    "so the question arises whether it s possible to get a good biphoton wave packet localization with a poor laser having a relatively high angular divergence ?",
    "is it possible to vary the degree of entanglement while keeping constant parameters of the pump and nonlinear crystal generating photon pairs ?",
    "the answer we give in this paper is yes , owing to the above - described anisotropy , it s possible to control the degree of wave packet localization and the degree of entanglement simply by tuning a crystal orientation with respect to detectors position . under the optimal conditions the achievable degrees of wave packet localization and entanglement appear to be very high .",
    "in particular , it becomes possible to get the coincidence angular biphoton distribution much narrower than that of the pump , which can look rather unexpected and unusual from the point of view of traditional theoretical and experimental approaches to the investigation of spdc entanglement .",
    "the results outlined above follow from the theoretical formulas to be derived below and they are confirmed by direct experimental observations .",
    "let us consider a collinear and degenerate type i spdc process , when extraordinary pump photon of a frequency @xmath33 decays in two ordinary photons ( signal and idler ) with equal frequencies @xmath34 and propagating more or less along the pump beam . in 3d , refractive index surfaces for extraordinary [ @xmath35 and ordinary [ @xmath36 waves in an anisotropic crystal are , correspondingly , an ellipsoid and a sphere . fig .",

    "related to the estimate of the entanglement parameter @xmath196 ( [ r - paral ] ) , the two new specific effects predicted for the @xmath71-geometry and differing it from the traditionally considered @xmath70-geometry are : ( 1 ) a very strong narrowing of the coincidence and ( 2 ) broadening of the single - particle distribution curves .",
    "the narrowing effect is very strong indeed : the width @xmath197 is 16 times smaller than the same width @xmath198 occurring in the perpendicular geometry , and 8 times smaller than the pump angular width @xmath13 .",
    "this shows , in particular , that the coincidence angular distribution appears to be narrower than that of the pump ( contrary to traditional expectations based on consideration of the @xmath70-geometry scheme ) .",
    "explanation of this effect is related to drastic changes in the structure of the sinc - function in eqs .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) , which occur when we move from the @xmath70- to @xmath71-geometry .    as for broadening of the single particle angular biphoton distribution in the @xmath71-geometry , it has a rather simple qualitative explanation in terms of the non - collinear phase matching down - conversion processes .",
    "their origin is illustrated by two pictures of fig .",
    "the first picture @xmath199 $ ] is the same projection of the refractive index        surfaces as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]@xmath6 .",
    "but now the pump wave vector @xmath52 is taken slightly deflected from the laser axis direction @xmath43 ( upon the angle @xmath103 ) .",
    "as @xmath200 is shorter than @xmath201 , its ending point @xmath202 can not be reached by two collinear wave vectors @xmath67 and @xmath62 , and these vectors must be non - collinear both to each other and to @xmath203 . as it s seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4]@xmath45 , the wave vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 providing fulfilment of the exact phase matching condition are emitted under angles ( with respect to the @xmath43 axis ) exceeding @xmath204 .",

    "[ fig4]@xmath45 around the direction of the pump wave vector @xmath52 we get cones along which the non - collinear - emitted photons can propagate . the cone opening angle changes with changing @xmath103 by forming in such a way the total emission area .",

    "[ fig4]@xmath74 ( shaded in grey ) .",
    "this area is seen to be wider than that of the pump ( shaded in black ) and it s seen to be wide both in the @xmath205 and @xmath55 directions .",
    "the last case corresponds to detection of photons in the @xmath70-plane .",
    "hence , as said above , emission of photons in the non - collinear phase matching regime can make the single - particle probability density distribution somewhat wider than that described by the dashed - line curve in fig .",

    "the point @xmath206 in fig .",
    "[ fig4]@xmath74 indicates the maximal achievable angle @xmath103 evaluated , e.g. , at a half - width of the pump angular distribution , @xmath207 .",
    "this value of @xmath103 provides the maximal emission cone opening angle , which is characterized by the circle in fig .",

    "[ fig4]@xmath74 that the emission are area is asymmetric with respect to the point @xmath53 ( @xmath208 and @xmath48 line crossing ) in the @xmath205 direction .",

    "[ fig3]@xmath74 ] .",
    "the reason of asymmetry is evident : deflection of the pump wave vector @xmath52 from the @xmath43 axis to the direction opposite to that shown in fig .",

    "one of the key parameters of the theory described above is the pump angular width .",
    "originally our he - cd laser had the angular width equal to 1.5 mrad . to see in experiment how the angular distrubution of the pump affects upon biphoton angular distributions ,",
    "we have artificially and anisotropically broadened the pump distribution in angles by installing in front of the crystal a slit . as a result ,",
    "the pump angular distribution remains localized along the direction parallel to the slit ( at the same level of 1.5 mrad as was without a slit ) but it spreads in the orthogonal direction .",
    "the slit was measured to be 40 mkm wide , which corresponds to the pump angular width in the direction perpendicular to the slit equal to 4.1 mrad .",
    "alternatively we have used in some measurements a lens instead of a slit to provide axially symmetric ( isotropic ) broadening of the pump up to the same width of 4.1 mrad .",
    "comaprison of results of such measurements was used for evaluating the role of the pump angular broadening for efficiency of emission processes arising under the non - collinear phase matching conditions .",
    "as mentioned above , in the experiment the detection plane was always horizontal .",
    "the slit was installed always vertically to provide angular broadening in the horizontal direction , whereas the crystal optical axis could be lying either in the vertical or horizontal planes . in terms of notations and definitions",
    "used above and introduced in the picture of fig .",
    "[ fig1]@xmath45 this means that our experimental measurements correspond to one of the following two situations : ( a ) detection and pump angular broadening directions are along the @xmath205 axis , i.e. , in the @xmath71-plane or in the plane containing laser and optical axes and ( b ) both detection and pump angular broadening directions are along the @xmath250 axis , i.e. , in the @xmath70-plane , and these directions are perpendicular to the plane containing laser and optical axes . in the case when lens is used for the pump broadening it provides equal angular broadening in @xmath205 and and @xmath250 , independently of the detection direction . as in the case",
    "@xmath46 the slit - broadened pump angular distribution is narrow in the @xmath205 direction , we expect that under these conditions non - collinear phase matching processes will be suppressed [ see the explanantion in fig .",
    "[ fig4]@xmath74 ] and the single - particle angular distribution in the direction @xmath55 will be narrower than in the case of lens angular broadening .",
    "another key parameter is angular derivative of the pump extraordinary refractive index @xmath130 near the exact phase matching direction @xmath43 .",
    "the table 1 shows this value for different crystals available for producing photon pairs .",
    "it shows that lithium iodate is the best candidate because in this crystal the derivative @xmath141 takes a rather large value .",
    "besides , the effect of high entanglement anisotropy discussed in the paper depends strongly on the product @xmath251 .",
    "so , the second reason why we chose this crystal is that the sample of lithium iodate can be made rather long .",
    ".angular anisotropy parameter @xmath130 for different non - linear crystals [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it follows from theory developed above , at sufficiently high values of @xmath141 the coincidence angular distribution of biphotons does not depend at all on the divergence of the pump [ see eq .",
    "( [ coinc - parll ] ) ] .",
    "moreover , being determined completely by properties of the crystal and , in particular , by anisotropy of the refractive index , the width of the coincidence distribution can be done even narrower than the pump angular width because . at the same time",
    "the width of the single - photon distributions grows up with the pump broadening .",
    "both narrowing of the coincidence and broadening of the single - particle angular distributions are factors resulting in a growing degree of entanglement .    the pictures of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] show two sets of angular distributions received in ( a ) single - particle and ( b ) coincidences measurements , which are plotted together for different geometries , with a slit broadened            pump beam .",
    "these pictures illustrate clearly that in the @xmath71-geometry coincidence distribution becomes narrower whereas the single - particle distribution broadens in comparison with the @xmath70-geometry .",

    "the corresponding theoretical estimates are @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "the difference between theoretical and experimental results is not too high , though quite visible .",
    "probably , it has different origin for coincidence and single width ratios . in the case of coincidence counts",
    ", we think that the main reason for a difference between the theoretical and experimental width ratios is related to some external factors owing to which the experimentally measured coincidence width is larger than the theoretical estimate ( 0.75 mrad in experiment compared to 0.5 mrad in theory ) . as for the single - particle width",
    ", probably in experiment the corresponding curve in the @xmath70-geometry did experience some broadening arising from the non - collinear phase matching emission processes , in spite of the missing slit - broadening of the pump angular distribution in the @xmath205 direction .",
    "in contrast to this , in theory presented above in the @xmath70-geometry case the non - collinear phase matching emission processes were completely excluded because only pump photons with wave vectors belonging to the observation plane were taken into account .",
    "hence , compared to the real experimental situation , the given above theoretical derivation of the single - particle angular distribution in the @xmath70-geometry artificially narrows the corresponding curve , and this is the reason for the observed discrepancy between theory and experiment . but",
    "let us emphasize once again : the discrepancy is not too high , and the degree of closeness of theoretical and experimental results can be considered as quite satisfactory",

    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] present the same experimental results only differently regrouped , which allows one to evaluate the experimentally found degree of entanglement .",
    "[ fig8 ] corresponds to the case when detector is scanning in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis ( @xmath70-geometry ) , and the slit broadens the pump angular distribution in the same direction .",
    "the width of the single-        particle distribution is 25 mrad whereas the width of the coincidence one is 8.4 mrad , i.e. , twice wider than the width of the pump [ in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ coinc - perp ] ) ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath256 , so the degree of entanglement is not very high .",
    "note , that in the above - presented theory we got for this ratio the twice smaller value , 1.5 .",
    "the reason is the same as discussed above : in theory the single - particle angular distribution is artificially narrowed because all non - collinear phase matching processes are completely excluded from the consideration .",
    "the results occurring in the case when both scanning and pump broadening occur in the plane containing the crystal optical axis ( @xmath71-geometry ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . here",
    "the widths of single- and coincidence distributions        are 60 mrad and 0.75 mrad correspondingly .",
    "their ratio is 80 , which is much greater than in previous case though is somewhat less than the corresponding theoretical estimate @xmath257 ( [ r - paral ] ) .",
    "the difference can be attributed only to some external factors affecting experiment . in the case of the @xmath71-geometry the above - discussed non - collinear phase matching processes",
    "are completely taken into account in the theoretical derivation , and the explanation of the theory - experiment discrepancies given above for the @xmath70-geometry does not work for the @xmath71-geometry .",
    "[ fig10 ] presents similar graphs but measured for the case when the laser pump is broadened with a spherical lens .",
    "this means that the pump broadening affects angular distributions in both directions and so , it is impossible to distinguish its contribution to spreading in @xmath71- or @xmath70-planes . according to the picture of fig.[fig4]@xmath74 , the single - particle distribution measured in @xmath70-plane must be wider when the pump angular distribution is broadened by a lens compared to the case of broadening by a slit .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by measurements which give ( for the @xmath70-geometry ) @xmath258=0.075/0.025=3 .",
    "however , another observed effect remains unexplained : for the same @xmath70-geometry the coincidence width in the case of lens - broadening appears to be smaller than in the case slit - broadening , @xmath259=0.0031/0.0084=0.37 .",
    "note also that in the case of lens broadening the values of the entanglement parameter @xmath20 appear to be somewhat smaller than in the case of slit broadening in both @xmath70- and @xmath71-geometries : in the case of lens broadening @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "but the main qualitative conclusions remain the same as earlier : at chosen values of the parameters almost no entanglement can be seen in the @xmath70-geometry and a very high entanglement can be and was observed in the @xmath71-geometry .            in conclusion",
    ", we have shown both theoretically and experimentally that there are two different schemes of observing spdc biphoton wave packets . in the traditional and alternative schemes",
    "the detector scanning is assumed to be performed in the planes , correspondingly , perpendicular and parallel to the plane containing optical and laser axes .",
    "owing to the anisotropy of the crystal refractive index for the extraordinary wave , a structure of the coincidence and single - particle biphoton wave packets observable in these two schemes are significantly different . in the alternative scheme , coincidence wave packets demonstrate a very strong narrowing compared to the traditional scheme , whereas the single - particle wave packets broaden .",
    "all this results in a very high degree of entanglement that can be observed in the alternative scheme of observations , and can not be seen in the traditional scheme .",
