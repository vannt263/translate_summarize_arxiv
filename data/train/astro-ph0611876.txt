    "plenty of studies have been made about shock propagation in stellar explosion .",
    "after the energy is liberated inside a star , a shock wave is formed to go through toward the surface .",
    "when it reaches there , it disappears .",
    "this event is called as shock breakout or shock emergence .",
    "material of the stellar envelope accelerated by the shock wave expands into the surrounding space as a rarefaction wave .",
    "the ejected matters continue to accelerate until their thermal energy is sufficiently converted into the kinetic energy .",
    "finally , they expand freely .",
    "first , @xcite posed this problem",
    ". @xcite solved it with a self - similar analysis , assuming one dimensional plane - parallel ( pp ) configuration .",
    "the stellar surface marks the boundary , on one side of it the atmosphere fills and on the other side the vacuum .",
    "the initial density distribution is assumed to follow the power law @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance from the surface .",
    "especially , @xmath6 represents the radiative envelope and @xmath7 convective .",
    "his self - similar solution is strictly restricted in applying to a real star , because sphericity is no longer ignorable in describing the flow far from the surface .",
    "@xcite worked to involve sphericity by adding correction terms proportionate to the power of non - dimensional parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance from the center and @xmath2 is the stellar radius .",
    "@xcite conducted a more detailed study .",
    "they investigated the progenitor dependence and the sphericity involvement and derived semi - analytic distributions of physical quantities such as the velocity and the density .",
    "these studies ignore effects of the special relativity and the radiative cooling , which causes the speed of the front in these studies to be developed to infinity .",
    "@xcite studied trans - relativistic flows .",
    "they estimated the maximum velocity of ejecta including the effects of sphericity and radiative diffusion .",
    "they also studied effects of aspherical structure and gravity .    in the ultra - relativistic limit",
    ", @xcite obtained a self - similar solution ignoring the rest mass energy .",
    "they assumed the same initial configuration as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the equation of state ( eos ) was assumed as @xmath10 in stead of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 the density , and @xmath14 the internal energy density per unit volume .",
    "this is the indispensable assumption to derive a self - similar solution .",
    "@xcite presented an analytic expression for the flow after shock emergence .    in this paper , we concentrate on the following two issues inherent to the above ultra - relativistic self - similar solutions .",
    "first , the assumption of spherical symmetry ( ss ) is a better approximation of a real system than that of pp .",
    "the farther a wave is from the stellar surface , the larger the deviation from the pp .",
    "the end of acceleration can not be described within the range that the pp approximation is valid , i.e. @xmath15 . the pressure varying as @xmath16 does not significantly drop in that range . to take into account the sphericity",
    ", we need to introduce a characteristic length , the stellar radius @xmath2 , which inhibits analyses by self - similar solutions .",
    "thus , in  [ s - involve ] , we conduct a successive approximation in terms of a parameter @xmath17 ( where @xmath1 is the distance of each fluid element from the stellar surface at shock emergence ) by which the sphericity is characterized . from the set of fundamental equations for ultra - relativistic hydrodynamics , we found that the sphericity is involved from the order @xmath18@xmath19 after shock emergence and @xmath18@xmath20 before shock emergence .",
    "we take this effect into account only up to the order @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "second , the acceleration does not terminate in @xcite s solution .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath21 of a fluid element increases infinitely with increasing time @xmath22 measured from the moment of shock emergence ; @xmath23 for any @xmath24 .",
    "the source energy of acceleration is the internal energy which is converted to the kinetic energy during expansion .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that when the internal energy is sufficiently consumed , the ejecta are no longer accelerated .",
    "this implies that their self - similar solutions can not describe a stage of free expansion .",
    "it might result from the eos @xmath25 neglecting the rest mass energy .",
    "the eos has to be @xmath26 in later phases when the gas becomes mildly relativistic . in  [ mr ] ,",
    "we derive the semi - analytic solution including this term in the eos .    in  [ nc ]",
    ", we conduct numerical calculations using the godunov method for relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the aim is to support the validity of the sphericity involvement and the semi - analytic solutions for mildly relativistic flows .",

    "in this section , we derive sphericity corrections to the pp flow after shock emergence .",

    "next we discuss the energy spectrum for spherical flows . from the numerical result ( @xmath253 ) for",
    "the mildly relativistic ss flow , @xmath254 the energy spectrum for ss is @xmath255 in terms of the energy , @xmath256     ( see text for detail ) .",
    "these results are obtained by numerical calculations for both pp and ss configurations with @xmath228 ( solid line ) and @xmath257 ( dotted line ) . ]",
    "although the definition of @xmath235 in the pp configuration differs from that in the ss configuration , the difference in geometry is negligible as far as we deal with very thin shells .",
    "sphericity does not significantly alter the exponents of @xmath238 in @xmath258 and @xmath235 from those of the pp flow , but reduces the absolute values of @xmath258 and @xmath235 compared to the pp flow .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath259 which is a deficit factor to characterize the reduction of the final velocity of an ss flow from the corresponding pp flow , @xmath260 we show the deficit factor @xmath259 of the flows with @xmath228 and @xmath257 in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the effect of sphericity is more prominent in the outer layers , which was seen in the flows with @xmath261 calculated by @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", they also showed that non - relativistic ss flows become identical to the corresponding pp flows in the outer layers .",
    "this figure also indicates that the spherical expansion in a more intense explosions with larger @xmath64 suppress the acceleration to a greater degree .",
    "note , however , that the pp flow with @xmath262 does not reach the free expansion phase in our calculation .",
    "thus the deficit factor @xmath259 for @xmath262 shown in this figure will be still decreasing as time elapses .",
    "we have derived the formula for sphericity correction to ultra - relativistic pp flows and presented the semi - analytic solutions for mildly relativistic flows after shock emergence . both are proved to have a good agreement with numerical results at least in the earliest phases of evolution after shock emergence .",
    "although the semi - analytic solutions include the rest mass energy in the eos , this inclusion of the rest mass energy does not lead to terminating the acceleration if the pressure to rest mass energy density ratio @xmath184 is large enough .",
    "the semi - analytic solutions can not describe the whole evolution of a flow for finite values of @xmath184 .",
    "this may be attributed to the assumption that a flow is described with one non - dimensional parameter except the initial condition . reaching the stage of free expansion",
    ", a pp flow appears to deviate from self - similarity even if it is ultra - relativistic .",
    "furthermore we neglect the effect of radiative diffusion which plays the critical role to suppress the acceleration .",
    "we conducted the numerical calculation for an ultra - relativistic flow by setting @xmath262 .",
    "the calculation continued till @xmath43 reached @xmath263 , but it could not reach the stage of free expansion .",
    "we could not confirm by numerical calculations whether an ultra - relativistic flow leads to free expansion or not .    on the other hand ,",
    "when a flow is not so ultra - relativistic at the time of shock emergence , the acceleration comes to an end both in ss and in pp configuration .",
    "however there remains a difference between them ; a spherical flow rather suddenly finishes the acceleration while a pp flow approaches the end of acceleration asymptotically ."
