    "throughout history , the scientific community has had the task of studying the properties of different dynamical systems and their importance to the environment where they are developed .",
    "for example , the fact that some dynamical systems are chaotic and have a critical dependence on initial conditions is known since late last century .",
    "this important characteristic has been correlated with the coexistence of several possible final stable states for a given set of parameters @xcite . in dissipative systems , this property is called  generalized multistability \" so it can be distinguished from the ordinary coexistence of stationary solutions @xcite .",
    "the term multistability was first used with respect to visual perception in 1971 @xcite ; nevertheless , the occurrence of multistability is very common in various fields of science , such as chemistry @xcite , optics @xcite , physics @xcite and biological systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of generating multistable structures resides in the wide variety of applications that exist : synchronization , complex networks , communication , climate , etc .    in this work",
    "it is taken advantage of the properties of the hybrid dynamical systems @xcite , such as the unstable dissipative systems theory based on piecewise linear ( pwl ) systems whose solution presents multi - scroll attractors @xcite .",
    "the method proposed here consists on designing systems taken from the jerky equation which present the coexistence of multistable state if the following conditions are met : i ) if the distance between the commutation law and the equilibrium point satisfies a specific ratio , and ii ) if the commutation law changes automatically regarding the values given to the nearest integer function or @xmath0 , dividing the space in equally distributed subdomains given along an axis depending on the initial state applied to the system .",
    "although there have been several reports on how to generate multistability , this is the first in our knowledge in which the values of the eigenspectra presented in the systems are being affected directly by means of the @xmath0 function .",
    "it will be shown that regarding these values , the system changes from multi - scroll attractors into a mono - stable state to the coexistence of several single - scroll attractors into a multistable state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the unstable dissipative system theory is introduced to generate scrolls along the @xmath1 axis and the function for the commutation surface displacement . in section 3 ,",
    "the nearest integer or @xmath0 function is analyzed as a basis for the commutation surface and equilibria displacement .",
    "section 4 contains the results about the transition from multi - scroll attractors to multistability . in order to explain the behavior of the system , bifurcation analysis of the parameters involved",
    "are studied along with the variation of the eigenspectra of the system .",
    "the results are displayed numerical depicting the multistable structures obtained .",
    "finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "consider the dynamical systems which are defined by a class of linear affine system given by :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the state vector , @xmath4 stands for a real vector and @xmath5 denotes a linear operator that is not singular with entries @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the equilibrium point of the system results in @xmath8 .",
    "the class of linear affine systems considered here , are those that present oscillations around the equilibria due to the stable and unstable manifolds @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these manifolds are defined in a way that @xmath11 is a set of column eigenvectors such that @xmath12 with @xmath13 ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in order to present such oscillations and following a similar mechanisms as in @xcite ,",
    "two types of dissipative systems with unstable dynamics have been studied which will be called unstable dissipative systems ( uds ) , however only one type of both will be considered here .",
    "this type is defined in the following way :    [ def_usd3 ] a linear system @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the state vector , @xmath5 is a linear operator and @xmath18 , are the eigenvalues of @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 , and one @xmath21 is real negative @xmath22 , and two @xmath23 are complex conjugated with positive real part @xmath24 then the linear system will be called a uds of the type i.    if the linear affine system given by eq .",
    "( [ ec_sistema ] ) satisfies the definition [ def_usd3 ] with @xmath25 then it is possible to generate an attractor @xmath26 by means of a pwl system under the following considerations for the vector @xmath27 :    @xmath28    the affine vector @xmath27 must be a switching function that changes depending on which domain @xmath29 with @xmath30 the trajectory is located .",
    "the equilibria of system are given by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , and each vector @xmath33 of the system is considered in order to generate a multiscroll attractor of system .",
    "the idea of the method lies on defining vectors @xmath33 in order to assure stability of a class of dynamical systems in @xmath34 with oscillations within the attractor @xmath26 . in a way that for any initial condition @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the basin of attraction , the system given by eq .",
    "induces in the phase space @xmath37 the flow @xmath38 .",
    "thus , each initial condition @xmath39 generates a trajectory given by @xmath40 which is trapped in an attractor @xmath26 after defining at least two vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 , as it is described in @xcite .",
    "this class of systems can display various multi - scroll attractors as a result of a combination of several unstable `` one - spiral '' trajectories .",
    "the number of scrolls depends on the number of vectors @xmath43 , @xmath32 introduced in the system , thus the equilibrium points are given by @xmath44 and which trajectories oscillate around them .",
    "this is a consequence of an important feature of this kind of uds , where they can result in one scroll attractor for each equilibrium point appropriately added in the domains @xmath45 in which the system is divided @xcite .",
    "a convenient approach to build the matrix @xmath19 and vector @xmath27 is based on the linear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) given by the jerky form : @xmath46 .",
    "the location where the scrolls are positioned can be understood from the following example which implies the coefficient matrix @xmath19 from the jerky equation @xcite and the affine vector @xmath27 as follows :    @xmath47    according with definition [ def_usd3 ] the following entries of the matrix @xmath19 will be considered :    @xmath48    and for the affine vector @xmath27 , the value of @xmath49 will commute according to the value of @xmath1 as follows :    @xmath50    here @xmath51 determine the values of the equilibrium points since @xmath52 , and @xmath53 stands for the location of the commutation surface given along the @xmath1 axis regarding the position that it takes with respect to the positive or negative axis and with @xmath54 . considering @xmath55 and @xmath56 the equilibria",

    "it is important to mention that the eigendirection determined by the two complex conjugate eigenvalues has been represented only as the projection of a line , however this manifold corresponds to a plane , also these manifolds end at the commutation surface but they were projected to the other domains in order to clarify their directions with respect to the other manifolds .",

    "the distance between each step is given by @xmath72.,width=415 ]    between both scrolls , the commutation surface at the plane @xmath62 is marked with a black dashed line , dividing the space in two domains @xmath73 .",
    "notice two important facts about the system , first that the scrolls are increasing their size due to the unstable manifold , this can be better appreciated at the projection of the attractor onto the @xmath64 plane from figure [ fig : bi ] b ) .",
    "second , that the trajectory of the system escapes from the domain @xmath74 with @xmath75 located in the left side of the commutation surface .",
    "this occurs near the @xmath65 manifold where it crosses the surface in the lower part of the figure [ fig : bi ] b ) and it is attracted by @xmath9 towards the equilibrium point in the domain @xmath76 located at the right side of the commutation surface .",
    "the process is repeated in the inverse way forming scrolls around each equilibrium point .",
    "this property of the uds can be easily extended for the generation of any number of scrolls along any of the axes if the above considerations are made when designing the system and locating equilibria along the axes in the following way @xcite .",
    "first , start considering @xmath55 ( in case that the first equilibrium point is located at the origin ) and the value of @xmath77 .",
    "thus the commutation surface @xmath78 that can result in two symmetric equilibrium points @xmath79 is given as @xmath80 , resulting in the two symmetrical scrolls .",
    "now in order to extend it along the @xmath1 axis , the distance @xmath81 between the equilibria must be considered between adjacent equilibrium points in the system .",
    "this idea of introducing more equilibria to the system can be done by considering the values @xmath82 , resulting in the consecutive equilibria along the @xmath1 axis @xmath83 with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the number of scrolls that are introduced in the 1d - grid along @xmath1 is @xmath86 .",
    "the commutation surfaces also should be located according to the value of the distance , in this case they are at @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the commutation law for a @xmath88 scroll attractor is given by     projection of the trajectory of the system given by eqs . and onto the @xmath63 plane with @xmath89 and @xmath60 .",
    "marked with red asterisk the equilibria of the system , and with gray line the commutation surfaces generated by the function .,width=415 ]",

    "each equilibrium point also depicts the @xmath9 and @xmath10 manifolds regarding their eigenvectors which are parallel among them similar as in the two scroll attractor .",
    "adding more equilibria to the system can be easily implemented by using a step function instead of generating commutation surfaces manually , i.e. , using an automatically step generating function as it has been applied in @xcite . here , the @xmath0 function will be implemented to simplify and automate this process .",
    "the function will be defined as follows :    @xmath93    for example , in order to have similar commutation surfaces and locations of equilibrium points that the ones described in eq . , consider the commutation of the vector @xmath94 given by the following function :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 corresponds to the amplitude of the function which is similar to the variable @xmath97 , and @xmath72 corresponds to the length of the step given by the round function centered in the origin , this is depicted in the graph of figure [ fig : round ] .",
    "notice that the value of @xmath72 has the same representation as @xmath98 .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath85 . the commutation surfaces and equilibrium points introduced by the function are located when the corresponding domain @xmath101 is being visited by the trajectory .",
    "it is important to mention that if @xmath72 corresponds to the distance between two continuous equilibrium points given a value of @xmath102 , then , each equilibrium point is located exactly at the middle of two consecutive commutation surfaces . besides",
    ", the equilibria of the system and the domains are located from @xmath103 due to the fact that the function given by is not bounded as the commutation law in or are .",
    "this can be understand in the following way , if the system increases the size of its scroll , eventually it crosses to the next or previous @xmath101 changing the value of @xmath102 and increasing the number of scrolls in the system .",
    "this number of scrolls continues increasing according with @xmath104 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : atractor_round_1 ] a projection of the trajectory of the system given by eqs . and into the plane @xmath63 is displayed , presenting each commutation surface and equilibrium point between @xmath105 generated from the signal considering @xmath89 , @xmath60 and @xmath106 .",
