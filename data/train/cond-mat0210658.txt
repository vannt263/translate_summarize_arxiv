    "hohenberg and kohn ( hk ) replaced the wave function by the electronic density @xmath11 as the fundamental variable of the many - body problem and thereby achieved a crucial breakthrough in the theoretical description of the electronic properties of matter.@xcite since then , density functional theory ( dft ) has been the subject of remarkable developments .",
    "formal improvements , extensions , and uncountable successful applications to a large variety of problems have made of this theory the most efficient , albeit not infallible , method of determining physical and chemical properties of matter from first principles.@xcite density functional ( df ) calculations are usually based on the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme which reduces the correlated @xmath12-particle problem to the solution of a set of self - consistent single - particle equations.@xcite while this transformation is formally exact , the form of the interaction - energy functional @xmath13 $ ] involved in the ks equations is not known explicitly .",
    "practical implementations of dft always require approximations to @xmath13 $ ] , or equivalently to the exchange and correlation ( xc ) functional @xmath14 $ ] , on which the quality of the results depends crucially .",
    "therefore , understanding the functional dependence of @xmath13 $ ] and exploring new ways of improving its approximations are central to the development of df methods .",
    "the most extensively used forms for @xmath13 $ ] are presently the local density approximation ( lda ) , @xcite its spin - polarized version or local spin - density approximation ( lsda)@xcite and the gradient corrected extensions,@xcite which were originally derived from exact results for the homogeneous electron gas . despite an unparalleled success in the most diverse areas",
    ", the lda - based approach fails systematically in accounting for phenomena that involve strong electron - correlation effects as observed , for example , in mott insulators , heavy - fermion materials , or high-@xmath15 superconductors .",
    "these systems are usually described in the framework of parametrized lattice hamiltonians such as anderson,@xcite hubbard,@xcite pariser - parr - pople,@xcite and related models which focus on the most relevant electron dynamics at low energies . however , even with simplified model interactions and a minimal number of orbitals per atom , a detailed understanding of the electronic properties in the strongly correlated limit remains a serious theoretical challenge .",
    "exact results are rare or numerically very demanding and a variety elaborate many - body techniques have been specifically developed in order to study this problem.@xcite being in principle an exact theory , the limitations of the df approach have to be ascribed to the approximations used for exchange and correlation and not to the underlying formalism .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to extend the range of applicability of dft to the many - body lattice models that describe the physics of strongly correlated systems .",
    "moreover , the development of lattice density - functional theory ( ldft ) constitutes an intrinsically inhomogeneous approach and provides a true alternative to the lsda and related gradient - corrected methods .",
    "thus , studies on simple models can open new insights into the properties of @xmath6 that should also be useful for future extensions to more realistic hamiltonians and first principles calculations .",
    "several physical problems have been already investigated by applying the concepts of dft to lattice models , for example , the band - gap problem in semiconductors,@xcite the role of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix and the non - interacting @xmath16 representability in strongly correlated systems,@xcite or the development of energy functionals of the density matrix with applications to hubbard and anderson models.@xcite in previous works@xcite we have considered a density - matrix functional theory of many - body lattice models , that is analogous to gilbert s approach in the continuum,@xcite and applied it to the hubbard hamiltonian with uniform nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping integrals @xmath17 .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath6 of the hubbard model has been calculated exactly as a function of the density matrix @xmath0 for various periodic lattices having @xmath18 for all nearest neighbors @xmath4 and @xmath19 .",
    "an analysis of the functional dependence of @xmath20 for different band fillings and lattice structures revealed very interesting scaling properties.@xcite on this basis , a simple general approximation to @xmath20 has been derived which yields a remarkable agreement with available exact results in 1d systems and which predicts successfully the ground - state energy and charge - excitation gap of the 2d hubbard model in the complete range of interaction strength.@xcite this shows that dft with an appropriate approximation to @xmath6 is an efficient tool for determining the electronic properties of many - body lattice models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the method by allowing for alternations of the density - matrix elements @xmath0 between nearest neighbors in order to study the dimerized 1d hubbard model .",
    "this problem has motivated a considerable research activity in past years , particularly concerning the role of electron correlations in the dimerization of polymer chains like polyacetylene.@xcite in this context two qualitatively different regimes may be distinguished depending on the relative importance of the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion @xmath21 and the nn hopping integral @xmath22 .",
    "on the one side , for small @xmath7 , the dimerization can be regarded as a bond - order wave that opens a gap at the fermi surface of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) single - particle band - structure ( peierls distortion ) . on the other side , for large @xmath7 , local charge fluctuations are severely reduced and the low - energy properties are dominated by antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations between spin degrees of freedom . in this case",
    "the dimerization can be regarded as an alternation of the strength of af correlations along the chain or spin - peierls state .",
    "one of our aims is to analyze the differences between these two types of behaviors in the framework of ldft .",
    "the properties of dimerized chains are also very interesting from a purely methodological point of view .",
    "they provide in fact a simple , physically motivated means of exploring the functional dependence of @xmath1 $ ] by including additional degrees of freedom , thereby allowing for a larger flexibility",
    ". moreover , several exact results are available to compare with ( e.g. , bethe - ansatz solution for the non - dimerized hubbard chain , finite - ring lanczos diagonalizations , or density - matrix renormalization - group calculations ) which allow to quantify the accuracy of the final results .",
