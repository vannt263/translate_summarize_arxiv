    "the globular cluster system ( gcs ) of the galaxy has long been considered to contain `` fossil records '' on early dynamical and chemical histories of the galaxy ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; harris 1991 ; mackey & gilmore 2004 ) . therefore physical properties of the gcs , such as the abundance gradient ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ) , radial density profile ( e.g. , zinn 1985 ; van den bergh 2000 ) , kinematics ( freeman 1993 ) , and proper motion ( dinescu et al . 1999 ) have been extensively discussed in the context of the galactic formation history .",
    "although recent numerical simulations of the galaxy formation based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model have provided a model explaining both dynamical and chemical properties of the galactic old stellar halo ( bekki & chiba 2000 , 2001 ) , theoretical models trying to explain the observed structural , kinematical , and chemical properties of the galactic gcs _ in a self - consistent manner _ have not yet been provided .",
    "this is partly because physical conditions required for globular cluster ( gc ) formation in low mass dwarfs , which can be the building blocks of the galaxy in the hierarchical clustering scenario , have not yet been completely clarified .",
    "recently , effects of reionization on galaxy formation have been extensively discussed , in particular , in the context of star formation histories and old stellar populations in low mass dwarfs ( e.g. , bullock et al 2000 ; gnedin 2000 ; susa & umemura 2004 ; grebel & gallagher 2004 ; bekki & chiba 2005 ) .",
    "these theoretical works suggested that suppression of star formation by heating and gas loss resulting from reionization can be a very important physical process for better understanding the observability and the early star formation activities in dwarfs , though grebel & gallagher ( 2004 ) did not find any clear fossil evidences that support the occurrence of such suppression at reionization era ( @xmath1 12.8 gyr ) in nearby dsphs . although it has already been discussed whether reionization can trigger ( cen 2001 ) or suppress ( santos 2003 ) the formation of globular clusters , it remains totally unclear how reionization determines dynamical and chemical properties of the galactic gcs .",
    "given the fact that unprecedentedly wealthy data sets on physical properties of the galactic gcs are now available ( e.g. , harris 1996 ; mackey & gilmore 2004 ) , it is worthwhile to discuss possible effects of reionization on the gc formation by comparing the observations with theoretical results in order to better understand the origin of the galactic gcs .    the purpose of this letter is to demonstrate , for the first time , that physical properties of the galactic gcs can be significantly influenced by reionization by comparing observational data of the galactic gcs with numerical simulations including possible influences of reionization on gc formation .",
    "we particularly show how the radial profile of the number distribution of the galactic gcs can be influenced by _ the suppression of gc formation by reionization _ by using numerical simulations of the galaxy formation based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "we firstly summarize three key observational results which can be interpreted as possible evidences for gc formation influenced by reionization in  2 , and then describe our numerical results in  3 and  4 .",
    "we suggest several observable gc properties that can be used to discuss reionization effects on gc formation for disk galaxies in  5 .",
    "interpretations given below for observational results would be somewhat speculative and are not unique , because there can be several alternative interpretations for each of the results .",
    "we however suggest that the origin of the results can be closely associated with some physical processes ( reionization etc . ) influencing the early galactic gc formation . it should be also stressed that the following observations could be only three among many of fossil evidences for the impact of reionization on the galactic gc formation .",
    "first is the steeper slope in the number density profile of the galactic gcs for the outer galactic halo ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "as figure 1 reveals , showing the radial profile of the cumulative number distribution of the gcs ( @xmath2 ) , the gc distribution ( @xmath3 ) becomes progressively steeper toward the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "if @xmath3 is approximated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance of a gc from the galactic center , @xmath6 is roughly @xmath7 for 2 @xmath8 @xmath5(kpc ) @xmath8 8 kpc ( van den bergh 2000 ) and @xmath9 for 20 @xmath8 @xmath5(kpc ) @xmath8 100 kpc ( it should be noted here that if @xmath2 is approximated as @xmath10 , then @xmath11 ) . the half - number radius of the galactic gcs ( @xmath12 ) can be estimated as 5.2 kpc .",
    "recent high - resolution cosmological simulations have shown that the cumulative radial distribution of dark matter subhalos in a milky way sized galaxy can increase linearly with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 corresponds to the virial radius of the halo , and have a half - number radius of @xmath1 @xmath15 ( see figure 2 in willman et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "these simulation results mean that the radial number distribution @xmath16 of subhalos can be approximated as @xmath17 with @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 and have the half - number radius ( @xmath21 ) of 209 kpc for @xmath14 = 348 kpc that is a reasonable value for the galactic mass of @xmath19 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 ( wilkinson & evans 1999 ) in the nfw profile ( model 5 in navarro et al .",
    "these observational and theoretical results raise the following question : if most of the galactic gcs originate from satellite galaxies in the subhalos ( e.g. , through accretion and tidal stripping of gcs ) , how can we explain the above remarkable differences both in the slope of density profiles in the galactic outer region ( @xmath6 and @xmath18 ) and in the half - number radius ( @xmath12 and @xmath21 ) between the gc distribution and the simulated subhalo one ?",
    "a possible explanation for this is that gc formation in outer subhalos ( i.e. , low mass dwarfs ) are strongly suppressed by some physical mechanisms .",
    "second is the apparently clear bimodality in the metallicity distribution of the gcs ( e.g. , zinn 1985 ; reed et al .",
    "theoretical studies suggested that the apparently clear secondary peak in the [ fe / h ] distribution can be due to secondary dissipative merger events that can form new , metal - rich gcs ( mrcs ) in the early dynamical history of the galaxy ( e.g. , ashaman & zepf 1992 ; bekki & chiba 2002 ; bekki et al .",
    "however recent semi - analytic study based on the cdm model ( beasley et al .",
    "2002 ) has demonstrated that such clear gaps between the two peaks seen in galaxies can not be easily explained by such merger - induced gc formation _ without truncating the formation of metal - poor gcs at very high redshifts ( @xmath26 @xmath1 5)_. therefore the observed bimodality can possibly imply that the strong suppression of the formation of the galactic metal - poor gcs ( mpcs ) by some physical processes .",
    "third is the significant difference in gc number between the galaxy and m31 ( e.g. , van den bergh 2000 ) . although the total mass can be roughly the same between the galaxy and m31 ( evans et al .",
    "2000 ) , the total number of gcs in the galaxy ( 160 @xmath27 20 ) is much smaller than that in m31 ( 400 @xmath27 55 ; van der bergh 2000 ) .",
    "this significant difference in the formation efficiency of gcs per galaxy mass can possibly indicate that gc formation is _ globally _ suppressed in the galaxy compared with m31 owing to some physical processes . thus we can interpret the above three observations as possibly implying the suppression of gc formation in the early galactic history . in the followings , we adopt a working hypothesis that reionization can be the mechanism responsible for the suppression of gc formation , and thereby investigate how it influences structural properties of the galactic gcs .",
    "we simulate the formation of a milky way sized galaxy halo in a @xmath28cdm universe with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 km @xmath32 @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , and thereby investigate merging / accretion histories of subhalos that can contain low mass dwarfs with gcs .",
    "the way to set up initial conditions for the numerical simulations is essentially the same as that adopted by katz & gunn ( 1991 ) and steinmetz & mller ( 1995 ) .",
    "we consider an isolated homogeneous , rigidly rotating sphere , on which small - scale fluctuations according to a cdm power spectrum are superimposed .",
    "the initial total mass , radius , spin parameter ( @xmath35 ) , and the initial overdensity @xmath36 of the sphere in the present model are @xmath37 , 30 kpc , 0.08 , and 0.26 , respectively .",
    "initial conditions similar to those adopted in the present study are demonstrated to be plausible and realistic for the formation of the galaxy ( e.g. , steinmetz & mller 1995 ; bekki & chiba 2001 ) .",
    "we start the collisionless simulation at @xmath38 ( = 30 ) and follow it till @xmath39 ( = 1 ) to identify virialized subhalos with the densities larger than @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the critical density , at a given @xmath26 .",
    "the minimum number of particles within a virialized halo ( @xmath42 ) is set to be 32 corresponding to the mass resolution of 3.8 @xmath23 @xmath43 @xmath25 . for each individual virialized subhalo with the virialized redshift of @xmath44 , we estimate a radius ( @xmath45 ) within which 20 % of the total mass is included , and then the particles within @xmath45 are labeled as `` baryonic '' particles .",
    "20 % of the _ outermost _ baryonic particles in a subhalo are labeled as `` gc particles '' so that the total number of gcs in the halo is 1 for the smallest halo with @xmath42 = 32 . thus the present simulation _ assumes _ that gcs can be formed in all low mass subhalos .    in order to investigate the effects of the suppression of gc formation via reionization on the final structural properties of the simulated gcs , we adopt the following somewhat idealized assumption : _",
    "if a subhalo is virialized after the completion of the reionization ( @xmath46 ) , gc formation is totally suppressed in the halo .",
    "_ therefore ,",
    "`` gc particles '' in the subhalo with @xmath44 @xmath8 @xmath46 are not considered at all in the estimation of structural properties of the simulated gcs .",
    "recent wmap ( _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ) observations have shown that plausible @xmath46 ranges from 11 to 30 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) whereas quasar absorption line studies can give the lower limit of 6.4 for @xmath46 ( fan et al .",
    "guided by these observations , we investigate the models with @xmath46 = 0 ( no reionization ) , 5 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "thus the present collisionless simulations follows the dynamical evolution of gcs originating from subhalos and do not include any _ dissipative _ formation of gcs associated with starbursts during merging / accretion of subgalactic halos .",
    "therefore , the simulated gcs can mimic old , mpcs rather than mrcs ( e.g. , `` disk gcs '' in the galaxy ) .",
    "all the calculations of the galaxy formation have been carried out on the grape board ( sugimoto et al . 1990 ) .",
    "total number of particles used in a simulation is 508686 and the gravitational softening length is 0.38 kpc .",
    "we consider that the final structure of the simulated gcs at @xmath39 ( = 1 ) is the same as that at @xmath26 = 0 , because the gcs is dynamically relaxed completely until @xmath39 for the present isolated model in which recent accretion / merging of dwarfs do not happen after @xmath39 .",
    "we used the cosmics ( cosmological initial conditions and microwave anisotropy codes ) , which is a package of fortran programs for generating gaussian random initial conditions for nonlinear structure formation simulations ( bertschinger 1995 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows how the galactic gcs can be formed through merging of subgalactic halos with gcs in the model with @xmath46 = 10 .",
    "subhalos grown from higher peaks of cdm density fluctuation are virialized earlier ( @xmath44 @xmath47 @xmath46 ) to contain older gcs within them , and these subhalos then merge with one another to form bigger subhalos with a larger number of gcs ( @xmath26 = 5.2 in figure 2 ) .",
    "numerous small subhalos without gcs can be seen around this redshift , which reflects the fact that about 47 % of all subhalos are formed later than @xmath46 from lower density peaks and thus suffer suppression of gc formation .",
    "these subhalos with and without gcs continue to merge ( @xmath26 = 3.0 ) to finally form a single massive halo ( @xmath26 = 2.1 ) with a number of bigger satellite halos with gcs .",
    "after accretion / merging of satellite subhalos and the resultant dynamical relaxation , a gcs finally forms with a relatively smooth gc density distribution , a triaxial shape , and the major axis of the distribution aligned with that of the dark matter halo .",
    "figure 3 shows the final radial profile of the cumulative number distribution ( @xmath2 ) of the simulated gcs in the model with @xmath46 = 0 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "it is clear form this figure that the profiles in the models with reionization are closer to the observed one than that in the model without reionization ( @xmath46 = 0 ) . in particular",
    ", the profile in the model with higher @xmath46 ( = 15 ) can more closely resemble the observed one than that in the model with lower @xmath46 ( = 10 ) .",
    "these results imply that the formation of the radial distribution of the galactic gcs could have been influenced by reionization .",
    "later accretion / merging of younger subhalos with gcs can add new gcs to the outer halo of the simulated galaxy and thus flatten the density profile of the gcs . in the model with @xmath46 = 15 , accretion / merging of younger subhalos can not influence the distribution of the gcs , because they do not contain gcs owing to later virialization with @xmath44 @xmath8 @xmath46 ( i.e. , suppression of gc formation ) .",
    "this is the essential reason why the model with @xmath46 = 15 can better reproduce the observation .",
    "the observed small half - number radius ( @xmath12 ) of 5.2 kpc ( e.g. , van den bergh 2000 ) can be also better reproduced by the model with @xmath46 = 15 showing @xmath12 of 5.0 kpc .",
    "the global mass profile of the simulated galactic dark matter halo does not depend on @xmath46 in the present study .",
    "therefore , figure 3 also suggests that the half - number radius of a gcs ( @xmath12 ) in a model with respect to the half - mass radius ( @xmath48 ) of the dark matter halo is smaller for higher @xmath46 .",
    "given the fact that ongoing observations on kinematics of gcss in galaxies enable us to infer mass profiles of the dark matter halos ( e.g. , bridges et al .",
    "2003 ) , this @xmath12-@xmath48 ratio can be regarded as an important observable property that measures the influence of reionization on gc formation in galaxies .",
    "as expected from the adopted assumptions of the model , the total number of gcs ( @xmath49 ) depends strongly on @xmath46 in such a way that @xmath49 is larger for smaller @xmath46 ( e.g. , @xmath49 = 4986 and 116 for @xmath46 10 and 15 , respectively ) .",
    "this result might well provide a clue to a question as to why the galaxy has only @xmath8 200 gcs .",
    "thus the observed compact gc distribution with a radius - dependent slope of the distribution in the galaxy can be better explained by the model with @xmath46 = 15 .",
    "previous theoretical studies demonstrated that destruction of gcs is a key physical process that controls the radial profiles of gcss in galaxies ( e.g. , baumgardt 1998 ; fall & zhang 2001 ; vesperini et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to discuss how",
    "the simulated radial profiles of gcss can be modified by this destruction process , we numerically investigated the orbital evolution of gcs in the model with @xmath50 and thereby estimated the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath51 ) and pericenter ( @xmath52 ) of each of the gcs formed before reionization .",
    "we found that most of the gcs have highly radial orbits ( @xmath53 ) with smaller pericenter distances ( @xmath54 10kpc ) .",
    "aguilar et al .",
    "( 1988 ) demonstrated that gcs with highly eccentric orbits ( @xmath55 ) and small pericenter distances ( @xmath54 2kpc ) can be completely destroyed by the galactic tidal field well within the hubble time . by combining this previous result with the above one on orbital properties of the simulated gcs",
    ", we found that about 55 % of the inner gcs in the simulation can be destroyed by the galactic tidal field .",
    "given the fact that selective destruction of gcs with higher @xmath51 and smaller @xmath52 can result in the flattening of the radial profiles of gcss ( e.g. , vesperini et al .",
    "2003 ) , the above result implies that the radial density profile of the _ initial _ galactic gcs possibly composed mostly of gcs formed before @xmath46 can be significantly steeper than that observed now .",
    "furthermore the kinematics of the galactic gcs is observationally suggested to be fairly isotropic ( e.g. , freeman 1993 ) , which appears to be inconsistent of the simulated kinematics of the gcs composed mostly of gcs with highly eccentric orbits .",
    "this apparent inconsistency implies that the origin of the observed isotropic kinematics can be also closely associated with later destruction processes of gcs .",
    "the present study neglects the influence of the _ local _ uv field from the first - generation gcs ( and very massive stars ) formed in subgalactic clumps at @xmath56 in a protogalaxy on gc formation at @xmath57 in the protogalaxy .",
    "the simulated gcs at @xmath58 has a half - number radius of @xmath59kpc , and an order of magnitude estimation implies that gc formation within the half - number radius might well be influenced by local uv effects from population iii stars even before @xmath46 .",
    "accordingly structural and kinematical properties of the inner gcs , which can be formed well before @xmath46 , could be particularly modified by this local effect .",
    "more quantitative estimation of this local uv effects on gc formation can be done in our future numerical studies with more realistic and sophisticated models of gc formation .",
    "these future studies will also address a role of reionization in shaping the bimodal color distribution of the galactic gcs .",
