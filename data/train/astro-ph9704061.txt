    "to explore the cosmic - ray spectrum beyond about @xmath2  ev requires ground - based experiments with large effective area and long exposure times to overcome the increasingly low flux implied by the steeply falling energy spectrum .",
    "such air shower experiments can not observe the primary particle directly but can only sample the cascade it generates in the atmosphere . for this reason ,",
    "obtaining results of astrophysical interest , such as the relative fraction of different types of nuclei or the fraction of gamma - rays , requires extensive monte carlo simulation to model the cascades and interpret the measurements .",
    "a recurring problem is that uncertainties in the input to the calculations introduce corresponding ambiguities in the interpretations of the experiments .",
    "a major , and to some extent unavoidable , source of uncertainty is the modelling of the hadronic interactions at energies well beyond those explored at accelerators . in the extreme case , protons with energies near the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff @xcite at @xmath3",
    "ev correspond to center - of mass energies more than two orders of magnitude beyond the highest energy hitherto available at hadron colliders .",
    "there are uncertainties also in the region of the `` knee '' of the spectrum around @xmath4  ev even though this is approximately equivalent to the center of mass energy of the fermilab collider .",
    "there are two reasons that significant uncertainties remain even at this relatively low energy .",
    "one is that interactions in the atmosphere involve nuclear targets , and in some cases nuclear projectiles as well .",
    "the other is that it is the forward fragmentation region of the collision  largely unexplored by collider detectors  that primarily determines the rate of energy deposition that generates the core of the atmospheric cascades .",
    "the most global properties of minimum - bias hadronic interactions determine the development of air showers .",
    "these include the cross section and the inelasticity .",
    "the @xmath5 cross section is directly measured up to @xmath6  tev , and its extension to higher energy can be obtained by extrapolation of fits based on regge theory .",
    "@xcite there is less agreement on how to extrapolate inelasticity and related quantities that determine the rate at which energy is deposited in the atmosphere via electromagnetic subshowers .",
    "we focus on inelasticity in this paper .",
    "we are motivated to study this problem now because of intense experimental activity and ambitious new proposals aimed at the highest energy cosmic rays @xcite as well as highly instrumented hybrid arrays aimed at discovering the sources of cosmic - rays that give rise to the knee feature in the spectrum , for example @xcite .",
    "there is a corresponding interest in simulations as illustrated by the systematic comparison of several codes undertaken by the group at karlsruhe .",
    "@xcite by installing several hadronic event generators into the same cascade code , they have isolated differences due to the input physics of the inteaction models from possible technical differences in how the cascades are followed .",
    "the latter in principle should not be sources of uncertainty in any case , being determined by well - known physics such as energy - loss by ionization , pair - production , bremsstrahlung , etc .",
    "qualitatively , the _ inelasticity _ of a hadronic interaction is the fraction of the beam energy not carried off by the fragment of the incoming particle .",
    "this fraction of the energy is then available for particle production , including neutral pions which transfer energy from the hadronic core of the shower into electromagnetic subshowers .",
    "inelasticity is just one moment of one of the inclusive distributions , but it is arguably the most significant for cascade development ( next to the inelastic cross section itself ) because it determines the rate at which the initial energy of the cascade dissipates .    for @xmath7 collisions",

    "given the overall normalization uncertainties in the pp data ( estimated to be @xmath9020% ) , the fitted results are remarkably close . for the calculation of nuclear processes the distributions are normalized so that there is exactly one nucleon ( proton or neutron ) propagating through the nucleus .",

    "this difference in momentum distribution for neutrons and protons can have two important consequences .",
    "first , in eqs . [ eq5 ] and [ eq6 ] there is a ` mixing ' of neutron and proton spectra controlled by the parameters @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to see that the amount of this mixing can affect fits to p - nucleus proton spectra if the input ( @xmath26 ) spectra differ .",
    "we will examine this in the next section .",
    "second , because the inital neutrons are softer , the leading nucleon inelasticity relevant to high energy cascade simulation may be less than one predicted on the basis of proton data alone together with the assumption that the inclusive distribution of neutrons is similar to that of non - diffractive protons .",
    "the number of terms to keep in eq . [ eq1 ] can be guided by considering the glauber probabilities @xmath93 for heavy target nuclei ( mass @xmath94 ) .",
    "one finds that roughly 90% of the cross section is obtained by the first five terms and 99% by the first eleven .",
    "we have terminated the sum at @xmath95 .",
    "twelve terms results in a large number of parameters to be fit unless some additional assumptions are made .",
    "our approach is to treat all interactions subsequent to the initial one on the same footing .",
    "this means that @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the functions @xmath98 have the same value for @xmath24 .",
    "indeed we have checked that relaxing this constraint has no substantial impact on the results .",
    "only marginally better fits are obtained if , for example , we allow a different @xmath99 for each value of @xmath15 .",
    "we give the slope functions the simple quadratic form @xmath100 and have checked that higher order terms do not substantially improve the fits to data .",
    "these three parameters together with @xmath101 and @xmath102 give a total of five free parameters for fitting the p - nucleus data .",
    "we have examined two distinct cases for the value of @xmath102 based on different extreme pictures for the nucleon propagation through the nucleus .",
    "the first can be thought of as the naive case in which all interactions proceede identically ; that is , the probability for isospin preserving reactions at each step is just equal to the proton multiplicity observed in p + p reactions , @xmath103 .",
    "note that in this case the probability that the leading nucleon is a proton quickly approaches 1/2 with increasing @xmath15 ( 14/27 for @xmath104 and is @xmath105 ) .",
    "the opposite extreme is that the isospin of the leading nucleon is determined solely at the first interaction .",
    "this second case corresponds to @xmath106 .",
    "we will show that these two pictures lead to somewhat different conclusions for the inelasticity of non - leading interactions required to fit the data .",

    "minimum - bias hadronic interactions proceed by the exchange of strings stretched between fragments of the incoming projectile and target particles .",
    "strings radiate a characteristic multiplicity of secondaries per interval of rapidity , so the increase of multiciplicity is essentially logarithmic in energy ( or more accurately , a power of the logarithm because the number of exchanged strings increases with energy ) .",

    "we note here that the singular nature of the sea quark distributions for small momentum fractions leads to a threshold effect in string - type models for @xmath119 .",

    "the results depend on the behavior of the cross section and inelasticity for proton - proton collisions , as illustrated in tables 1 and 2 .",
