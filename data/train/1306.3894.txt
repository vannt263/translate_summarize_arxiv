    "the size and oxidation state of a and b cations determine the symmetry of the perovskite structure , that departs from cubic when a tilting of the octahedral arrangement of oxygen around the b cation occurs @xcite .",
    "also , the partial replacement of a or b site cations by isovalent or aliovalent a and b atoms could result in a double perovskite structure with lower symmetry . in double perovskites with general formula a@xmath0(bb)o@xmath6 ,",
    "b and b atoms occupy two different crystallographic sites , and an ordered or disordered occupancy of them depends on the oxidation state and size difference between b and b ions @xcite .    many of the magnetic interactions found in transition metal oxide perovskites are due to superexchange and/or super - superexchange interactions mediated through the oxygen orbitals . in some materials the relative strength and arrangement of these interactions determine the magnetic structure , range of the ordering temperatures and the possibility of frustration @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effective spin lattice , ferro- or antiferromagnetic interactions among transition metal ions , depends on a delicate balance provided by the charge in the linking orbital , the bond angle , the degree of orbital overlap , the distance between interacting ions and their spin state @xcite . in the specific case of the perovskite structure ,",
    "the typical bond angles and distances usually favors antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions @xcite .",
    "however , in some particular cases , when there are more than one electronic pathway in the linking orbitals , a destructive interference leads to the cancellation of the antiferromagnetic interaction . in these cases , a weak ferromagnetic coupling becomes relevant @xcite .    in transition metal oxides ,",
    "the competing effects of a ferromagnetic interaction and local frustration leads to a spin glass like behavior @xcite .",
    "the main signatures of this frustration are made evident in the time evolution from metastable magnetic states @xcite .",
    "however , in bulk ferro / ferrimagnetic samples , a local frustration is normally hard to visualize due to the magnetic history dependence of the metastable states created by the pining of domain walls .",
    "also in some transition metal oxides the competition between a ferro- and antiferromagnetic ground states leads to a nonequilibrium glassy behavior that arises from a kinetic arrest of a ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition @xcite .",

    "the value obtained was @xmath62= 3 10@xmath64 erg/@xmath65 .",
    "although the calculated anisotropy constant is of the order of the value found in other ferrimagnets @xcite , the exchange stiffness constant is small due to the rather long average distance between uncompensated ni@xmath7 moments in the structure .",
    "the microscopic origin of the change of regime of domain wall pinning mechanism at 20 k remains unclear .",
    "the onset of a disordered or frustrated magnetic state may result in the emergence of strong pining sites for dw movement .",

    "similar loops as those shown in figure [ loopsraw ] were obtained for several temperatures , below and above the temperature of the steep increase of the coercive field when lowering @xmath31 . we have found that the virgin curve excursion outside the regular loop takes place at low temperatures ( @xmath67 20 k ) coinciding with the regime of sdwp described previously .    in some systems",
    "the virgin curve was observed to go outside the loop for a certain range of fields and temperatures @xcite . in some complex magnetic oxides",
    "this feature was related with magnetic cation disorder @xcite , which led not only to a spin - glass behavior but also to local structural distortions .",
    "these local distortions are due to a microscopic rearrangement of valence electrons @xcite , or to magnetic cations deficiency changing the nature of the local crystal field @xcite which in turn lead to an irreversible movement of domain walls @xcite .",
    "the anomalous virgin curve in a ferrimagnet was also attributed to the development of an antiferromagnetic order at low temperature that produces a magnetic glass state @xcite .",
    "figure [ rinis ] shows the @xmath34 derivative of the virgin curves dm / dh at several temperatures for the thin film , single crystals and polycrystalline pellets . in the thin film case ( figure [ rinis](a ) ) , the derivative is approximately constant .",
    "for all the other samples there is a maximum in the derivative that indicates a characteristic field , @xmath68 , for the magnetic moments alignment , larger than the coercive field at low @xmath31 ( figure [ deltahvst ] ) .    in a spin glass scenario",

    "therefore a @xmath31 dependence following the almeida - thouless @xcite or gabay - tolouse @xcite models could be expected .",
    "this is not our case , indicating a more complex behavior involving the hindering of dw movement .",
    "we have also ruled out the magnetic glass @xcite scenario because we found no evidence for a long range antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures and we did not detect differences between fc cooling and fc warming magnetization measurements at 1 koe as in a typical magnetic glass displaying the kinetic arrest of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath68 and @xmath55 ( figure [ deltahvst ] ) is larger for single crystals than for polycrystalline pellets suggesting an intrinsic origin for this behavior .          to understand the microscopic origin of the frustration the local magnetic interactions of ni@xmath7 have to be analyzed .",
    "they depend on the nearest magnetic neighbor ( 1 nnn ) and on the exchange path for the second and third nearest neighbor ( 2 nnn , 3 nnn ) . considering the structure ( figure [ structure](left ) ) with perfect stoichiometry and full ni@xmath7 occupancy of the @xmath25 site , the interaction among 1 nnn relays on the presence of a ni@xmath7 in the closer @xmath26 site ( 1/3 ni@xmath7 ion occupancy ) .",
    "if this is the case there will be an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction of the ni@xmath7-o - ni@xmath7 kind @xcite .",
    "the remaining 2/3 of the @xmath26 sublattice is occupied by non magnetic ( d@xmath70 ) sb@xmath16 ions .",
    "then , a ni@xmath7 ferrimagnetic lattice is formed at the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sites . the @xmath25 site",

    "the microscopic origin of the barrier which is overcome by increasing @xmath34 at low @xmath31 is still not clear .",
    "it is probably related to the spin orientation of the ni@xmath7 moments interacting antiferromagneticaly with its 1 nnn trying to keep their antiferromagnetic arrangement in planes perpendicular to @xmath34 and the uncompensated ni@xmath7 moments following the field as in a normal ferromagnet .",
    "the random orientation of the antiferromagnetic regions and the frustrated interaction near sb@xmath16 ions hinders the initial movement of the dw .",
    "when they are oriented , further changes of the magnitude of @xmath34 result only in canting of the moments .",
    "however , the canting is not very important since a magnetization saturation value seems to be almost achieved at 5 t with @xmath50 corresponding to the uncompensated ni@xmath7 moments in the ferrimagnetic structure , as described in previous sections .",
    "this model can be tested going back to the zero magnetization state with a demagnetizing protocol , illustrated in the insets of figure [ demagnraw ] .",
    "after this demagnetizing procedure , the zero magnetization state would involve only a random orientation of the uncompensated ni@xmath7 moments and the antiferromagnetically arranged regions would have the moments perpendicular to the direction of the preexisting field , providing a new ground state .",

    "this new initial magnetization is measured after the demagnetizing protocol shown in the inset .",
    "the absence of exchange bias @xcite in the magnetization loops indicate that large clusters with only antiferromagnetic super exchange ni@xmath7-o - ni@xmath7 interactions are not likely to exist ( i.e : the one third ni@xmath7 occupancy of the @xmath26 site seems to be homogeneous at a microscopic level ) .",

    "we can observe in figure [ rinisdemag ] that the initial susceptibility of the virgin curve after isothermal demagnetization is larger than the corresponding to the thermally demagnetized sample indicating that the new ground state is easier to magnetize in the direction of the preexisting magnetic field .",
    "for the thin films , no indication of the frustrated state was found ( figures [ loopsraw](a ) and [ rinis](a ) ) .",
    "the superexchange and super - superexchange interactions are very sensitive to bond angles and lengths @xcite , which are likely modified near the surface . in our samples ,",
