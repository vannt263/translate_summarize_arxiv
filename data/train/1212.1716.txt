    "pulsars were originally discovered through their single pulse emission @xcite . however , periodicity - based search techniques later dominated major pulsar search efforts due to the drastic gain in sensitivity they provided to typical pulsar signals ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . a recent renewal of interest in single pulse searches led @xcite to uncover sporadic pulses from eleven neutron stars whose signal was not detectable through periodicity searches in their 35-minute observations .",
    "these objects were dubbed rotating radio transients ( rrats ) , and since 2006 , single - pulse searches of archival and new pulsar surveys have revealed more than 60 further examples of such objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if all rrats sporadically - detectable emission arises from nulling , the net galactic population of these objects may be equal to or greater than that of steadily - emitting radio pulsars , generating a substantial discrepancy between neutron star birthrates and core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) rates @xcite .",
    "this has given rise to questions about the intrinsic nature of rrats , and how their observed behaviour may link to other pulsar populations or to a cycle in normal pulsar evolution .",
    "motivated by this , below we make explicit what is meant by the term `` rrat , '' and review what studies are revealing about these objects relationship to other neutron star populations .",
    "in recent papers reporting pulsar survey results , the most common definition of rrat applies to a pulsar that was discovered in single pulses , but not in the periodicity - based search in the survey .",
    "the reasons that this may arise is : 1 ) a pulsar has a very high nulling fraction , thus a weak fourier strength ; 2 ) a pulsar has a pulse energy distribution with a weak average but extended tail ; or 3 ) the presence of radio interference has caused a regularly - emitting pulsar s periodicity to experience a degradation of signal strength , or to be masked or passed over in the inspection process .",
    "pulsars in the third category make up a minority ( @xmath05% ) of single pulse search results , and can generally be identified by excising interference from the discovery data or obtaining cleaner follow - up observations .",
    "we can analytically approximate what level of nulling and modulated pulsars will lead pulsars in a survey to be considered rrats . @xcite",
    "derived the signal - to - noise ratio found for a pulsar with unimodally and bimodally - distributed flux in a periodicity search and single pulse search .",
    "let us consider a pulsar with single pulse above the survey detection threshold , where the average signal - to - noise ratio of detected pulses is given by @xmath1_{sp}}}\\rangle$ ] . to be considered",
    "a rrat , @xmath2_{ft}}}$ ] must be less than the periodicity detection threshold , @xmath3 . following from mclaughlin & cordes , we derive : @xmath4_{sp}}}\\rangle}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{p}{t_{\\rm obs}}}~ , \\ ] ] where nf is the pulsar nulling fraction",
    ", @xmath5 gives the observation length , @xmath6 is the pulsar period , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are pulse - shape - dependent parameters of order @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , a non - nulling , modulated pulsar will be considered a rrat if : @xmath10_{sp}}}}{2\\,{m_{\\rm ft}}}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{t_{\\rm obs}}{p}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the maximum flux likely to be emitted over the observing interval ( as given by the pulse energy distribution statistics ) , @xmath12 is the modified average pulse intensity defined by @xcite , and here @xmath2_{sp}}}$ ] represents the signal - to - noise ratio of the brightest pulse detected in the single pulse search .",
    "what is immediately notable about these equations is that whether upon discovery a pulsar is called a `` rrat '' is dependent on the pulsar s rotational period , and also highly survey dependent , changing with survey observing length and assumed detection thresholds ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "several methods exist to determine the underlying nature of rrats .",
    "perhaps the most effective of these is in pulse energy distribution analysis ( e.g. as in @xcite , miller et al .  in prep ) .",
    "this can uncover energy bimodality ( implying a nulling pulsar ) or reveal distributions in energy and time that are consistent with the lognormal or power - law distributions typically attributed to pulsars .",
    "thus far , few analyses of such kind have been published , and so we can not reliably assess the percentile breakdown of the underlying emission type of the @xmath970 currently - identified rrats .",
    "however , the cursory studies of @xcite and deeper studies of @xcite have indicated that it is likely a large fraction of rrats are in fact undergoing nulling ( or , at least , are bimodally distributed with a low state below the detection thresholds ) .",
    "we now seek to quantify how excessive modulation and nulling are in rrats when compared with the distribution of these phenomena in the general pulsar population .",
    "previous studies have indicated that pulse - to - pulse energy density variations are typically lognormally distributed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or follow a power - law distribution ( as with giant micropulses ; @xcite ) .",
    "soon after the first report of rrats , @xcite revealed that psrb0656 + 14 has an extremely extended lognormal tail ( such that @xmath13 ) ; they noted that were the pulsar at a greater distance , it would have been detected as a rrat ( fulfilling eq.[eq : mod ] above ) .",
    "recently , the first targeted measurements of single pulse energy distributions for a large pulsar sample were reported by @xcite .",
    "their analysis suggested that long - tailed pulsars like b0656 + 14 are uncommon , and that most pulsars appear to cluster around a relatively narrow range in lognormal shape parameters .    in figure[fig : mod ] , we reproduce the distribution of phase - dependent @xmath14 measured for that sample .",
    "using eq.[eq : mod ] and @xmath15 we have marked , for various surveys , the limit above which a pulsar with @xmath16s and @xmath2_{sp}}}=6 $ ] will be discovered as a rrat . similar to that of the distribution s sample , 9minutes ; if the distribution were made from shorter / longer observations , we would expect the distribution to extend to lower / higher values , respectively .",
    "] this appears to suggest that while single pulse searches may certainly uncover extremely modulated pulsars , pulsars do not necessarily have to exhibit excessive modulation to be found as rrats in a search , particularly for surveys of relatively short duration .    ) for a sample of 314 pulsars .",
    "we indicate the line above which a pulsar might appear as a rrat in various surveys .",
    "see sec.[sec : mod ] for discussion .",
    "surveys are : @xcite , @xcite ; htru south mid - lat , @xcite ; parkes multibeam , @xcite .",
    "this figure was adapted from @xcite.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]      there are three variations of nulling activity that have been recognised :    * `` standard '' nulling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which nulling fractions range from a few percent up to @xmath995% , and activity timescales range seconds to minutes . *",
    "high - fraction nulling , i.e. as in some rrats .",
    "analysis of these objects indicates nfs upwards of 99% . in objects discovered as rrats",
    ", the typical null timescale far exceeds that of the emitting timescale ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . *",
    "intermittent pulsars @xcite , which undergo nulling and emission cycles on timescales of weeks to years .",
    "the activity timescales in both null and active states appear to follow characteristic spans for all of these variations , and some nulling appears quasi - periodic .",
    "the pulsation rate of most rrat discoveries tend to be reproducible between observations , and they may also exhibit long - timescale quasi - periodicities @xcite .",
    "this consistency allows a comparison of average emission / null cycle for the various manifestations of nulling .",
    "such an analysis was performed by @xcite , who found that the cycle times of @xcite nulling pulsars appear continuously distributed with those of rrats ( as we would expect given eq.[eq : null ] ) .",
    "the @xmath17% pulsars were exclusively highlighted by rrats , with the highest exceeding @xmath18% .",
    "intermittent pulsars yet remain isolated from short - duration null cycle pulsars .",
    "this perhaps marks two distinct populations , however the lack of current surveys sensitivity to intermediate - timescale null cycles indicates that perhaps there is yet an undiscovered population of pulsars undergoing such nulling .",
    "it is the nature of extreme nulling pulsars ( @xmath19% ) which most motivates continued observations of rrat discoveries , and on which we focus the remainder of this manuscript .",
    "510 pulses per activity cycle , while psrj122632 emits singular pulses , perhaps signifying a typical emission timescale of less than the rotational period.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]",
    "it is not yet known what triggers nulling activity in pulsars , and whether there is some internal plasma / energy timescale intrinsic to the pulsar , or an external influence like asteroid bombardment @xcite .",
    "we have previously noted the issue of matching neutron star birthrates with the occurrence rate of the ccsn thought to produce pulsars ; in this discourse we may find circumstantial clues to how nulling phenomena relate to other pulsar populations .",
    "taking the original 11 rrats to be nulling objects , @xcite calculated the implied population of galactic pulsars to be 2@xmath20 , several times larger than the estimates for standard pulsars @xcite .",
    "the high - nulling - fraction population makes the largest contribution to the factor of 56 excess in neutron star birthrates , with other contributions made by radio quiescent populations such as x - ray dim isolated neutron stars , magnetars , and central compact objects @xcite .",
    "while it is perhaps feasible that birthrate estimates have been grossly overestimated , the ccsn rate has been grossly underestimated , or there is a highly effective alternate source of pulsar production , a very plausible solution to the birthrate discrepancy can be found by drawing an evolutionary link between nulling behaviours and other neutron star varieties .",
    "it has long been debated as to whether nulling fraction correlates with any pulsar spin parameters , particularly with @xmath21 or characteristic age ( @xmath22 ) , as might be the case if nulling is related to pulsar evolution .",
    "no definitive answer has yet been provided , particularly as nulling studies seem to disagree : @xcite first reported a relationship , whereas @xcite reported no clear correlation between these two parameters .",
    "@xcite subsequently reported only a weak nf@xmath22 anti - correlation , and that in fact a stronger anti - correlation exists between the nf and the magnetic / rotational alignment of the pulsar beam .",
    "most recently , @xcite performed a dedicated study of nulling for pulsars in the parkes multibeam survey , again reporting a weak anti - correlation of age with nf , noting that there is a higher tendency for pulsars with a high nf ( @xmath2360% ) to be older than 5myr .",
    "single pulse searches are intrinsically biased to discover nulling pulsars with longer periods ( eq.[eq : null ] ) , so a separate analysis of only rrats can not wholly inform the above discourse . however",
    ", ongoing timing observations @xcite have shown that rrats discoveries seem to support the wang et al .",
    "observation ( most reported solutions show @xmath24 a few myr ) .",
    "strikingly , the bridge in @xmath6@xmath25 space between canonical pulsars and both magnetars and x - ray dim isolated neutron stars is preferentially highlighted by rrat discoveries .",
    "this seems to give a cursory indication that extreme nulling pulsars may somehow link these populations .",
    "one of the original @xcite discoveries , psrj18191458 , shows the strongest evidence for an evolutionary tie between neutron star populations .",
    "its estimated surface magnetic field strength , @xmath26 g , is the highest known among rrats , and lies just below the lowest known magnetar @xmath27 @xcite . dedicated monitoring and timing of this pulsar led @xcite to report the occurrence of an `` anomalous glitch '' in the pulsar , where the post - glitch recovery led to a net decrease in @xmath25 , rather than the increase typically observed in glitching pulsars .",
    "the implication of repeated occurrence of such glitches is that psrj18191458 would experience secular migration from magnetar - like spin parameters to those of standard radio pulsars .",
    "that psrj18191458 is currently magnetar - like is also supported by the properties of its detection the x - ray and infrared wavebands @xcite .    of course",
    ", psrj18191458 is only one example of an extreme nulling pulsar , and we can not presume it represents the entirety of this population .",
    "ongoing studies will reveal whether other objects reflect similar behaviours .",
    "thus far only a few rrats have been targeted for detailed study ; @xcite has reported on six more of the original 11 rrats , noting that no glitches have yet been observed in these pulsars .",
    "@xcite furthermore found no infrared detection in psrj1317 - 5759 , and @xcite put limits on x - rays from psrsj08474316 and j18460257 .",
    "we can identify several points of future study that will advance our understanding of rrats .",
    "in particular , targeted differentiation of modulated / nulling rrats , and the obtainment of timing solutions for these objects , will provide measured spin parameters , a large number of pulse detections , and precise positions for these objects .",
    "this will leading to nf studies that include extreme - nulling objects to search for correlations with other neutron star properties .",
    "further detection of ( or limits on ) the presence of glitches in these objects will explore their spin evolution in comparison with canonical pulsars and other neutron star populations . finally , obtaining precise rrat positions will overcome issues of crowded high - energy fields , and",
    "may lead to further understanding of these objects through x - ray and other high - energy detection .",
    "a portion of this research was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
