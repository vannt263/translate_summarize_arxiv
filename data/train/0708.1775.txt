    "in addition to evidence for mass infall ( accretion ) , many pre - main - sequence stars also possess prominent outflows and jets .",

    "outflows can extend many parsecs in length , and can serve as `` fossil records '' of the accretion process , providing indications of temporal variability of accretion or precession of outflow axes over thousands of years @xcite .",
    "furthermore , outflows inject turbulence into molecular clouds and may regulate overall star formation efficiency @xcite .    outflows from young stars may be observed both through shock - excited emission lines such as [ sii ] 6716 , 6731 (e.g .",

    "this general @xmath1co @xmath2  morphology in figure [ 198co_mom0 ] is discernable from the co @xmath6 emission of @xcite observed with 20  resolution with the jcmt , which shows that blue - shifted and red - shifted emission overlap southeast of the lkh@xmath0  198/198-ir sources and that secondary blue and red - shifted peaks are seen @xmath31  north of these objects .",
    "however , with the superior resolution of the bima array ( and the removal of large scale emission from the maps ) , the outflow structure can be resolved .",
    "in addition to the images presented above , we can construct spectra toward the known point sources in the field , including lkh@xmath0  198 .",
    "such spectra can indicate whether line emission is optically thick or self - absorbed ( from the line shape ) or if high - velocity gas is associated with a given position ( though the presence of emission in the line wings ) .",

    "we suggest that the ring of red - shifted emission is in fact a juxtaposition of the red - shifted lobes of these two outflows , where their expansion has been hindered due to a dense molecular cloud lying to the northwest , with the cavity of the pole - on outflow ( a coherent structure ) . as in the lkh@xmath0  198 region ,",
    "higher resolution , mosaicked maps would help disentangle the outflows from the lkh@xmath0  225 sources .",
    "estimation of the mass in these outflows is not easy based on the data presented here because they can only be resolved within the bima array antenna field of view , whereas the outflows certainly extend to larger spatial scales . in several cases , emission from several outflows is clearly combined , further complicating the independent assessments of masses .",
    "finally , we find evidence of higher density gas in both regions , with @xmath3co @xmath2  and cs @xmath6  detected toward all eight sources and n@xmath4h@xmath5 @xmath2  detected in the objects in cygnus .",
    "localizing the precise sources of this emission requires higher resolution observations , since the separation of sources is comparable or smaller than the fcrao beam .    the authors would like to thank mark heyer for advice and observing the fcrao data for us .",

    "<S> the outflow around lkh@xmath0  198 resolves into at least four outflows , none of which are centered on lkh@xmath0  198-ir , but even at our resolution , we can not exclude the possibility of an outflow associated with this source . in the lkh@xmath0  225s region , we find evidence for two outflows associated with lkh@xmath0  </S>",
