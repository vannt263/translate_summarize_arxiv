    "<S> while one theoretical scenario for explaining these plateaus was proposed in analogy to the quantum hall effect@xcite , a few points , such as the number of magnetization plateaus and the magnetization values of plateaus , are at the moment controversial .    in recent experiments on rare - earth metals @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> [ r is a rare - earth atom]@xcite , fractionalized magnetic plateaus were also discovered at a very low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these compounds have a tetragonal crystal structure @xmath13 and the magnetic moments originating from @xmath14 locate on the ssl in the @xmath15-plane . in @xmath1 , a large @xmath5=@xmath16-magnetization - plateau region </S>",

    "<S> an important point that is the most different from @xmath4 is that , in the @xmath1 case , a strong anisotropy along the @xmath18-axis is expected owing to the crystal fields . </S>",
    "<S> recent analysies for specific heat measurements and the magnetization process@xcite suggested that the @xmath19=@xmath20 multiplet of @xmath21 is lifted , and then , the lowest energy state for a single ion is the non - kramers doublet with @xmath22=@xmath23 , having a large energy gap between the lowest states . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to describe the low - energy magnetic part of @xmath1 by a binary model . since it is expected that isotropic interactions work between the moments via itinerant electrons , we start from the two - site hamiltonian , @xmath24 , where @xmath25=@xmath26 , @xmath27=@xmath28 , and @xmath29@xmath30@xmath31@xmath32@xmath33 . in the ground state of @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> , there are four degenerated states , namely @xmath34=@xmath35 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> when we treat @xmath27 as the perturbation , the first nontrivial off - diagonal term occurs from the 2@xmath19-th order . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained effective hamiltonian is the @xmath0 ising - like xxz hamiltonian with the transverse term proportionally to @xmath37 . note that the transverse term always becomes @xmath38 independently on the sign of @xmath39 because @xmath19 is integer . </S>",
    "<S> meng and wessel studied the magnetization curves for the effective hamiltonian by quantum monte carlo computations@xcite . from the obtained results , it was found that the origin of the @xmath5=@xmath16 plateau can be explained by the quantum effect because only the @xmath5=@xmath9 plateau was confirmed in the ising model case . </S>",
    "<S> however , the phase diagram for the ising - like xxz model case showed that the @xmath5=@xmath9 plateau phase spreads more widely than the @xmath5=@xmath16 plateau phase . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath5=@xmath9 plateau was not observed in @xmath40 , their results seem to be inconsistent with the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> this inconsistency may arise from the absence of `` long - rang '' interactions among magnetic moments of @xmath41 ions , namely , the rkky interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic properties of the ising - like xxz model with the long - range interactions have not studied yet . </S>",

    "<S> one is the bare spin correlation defined by @xmath68 , and the other is the bond spin correlation defined by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is defined only on the plaquettes with the diagonal coupling @xmath19 . the bond spin correlation is convenient for characterizing the crystallization of the triplet dimers with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which can not be detected from the bare spin correlation . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ correlation ] , we find that both spin correlations show the presence of a true long - range order at @xmath66 and @xmath65 . in the @xmath56 lattice systems at @xmath57 , we confirm that no other plateau survives in the thermodynamic limit and that the ferromagnetic @xmath44 coupling tends to stabilize @xmath74 the 1/2 plateau even when the coupling ratio @xmath64 varies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we believe that the ferromagnetic @xmath44 coupling plays a significant role in explaining the @xmath16 plateau observed in @xmath1 .    to discuss the reason why the field range of the @xmath9 or @xmath16 plateau </S>",

    "<S> [ spin_config ] shows the conventional spin configurations at a very low temperature , which are obtained from computations for the ising model case . at @xmath45 , the collinear order shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spin_config ] ( b ) is stabilized by the @xmath43 and @xmath44 couplings , and the local energy is given by @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> in the same manner , we obtain @xmath77 for the @xmath9 plateau state and @xmath78 for the @xmath16 plateau state . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy of the fully polarized state is given by @xmath79 , the field ranges of the @xmath9 and @xmath16 plateaus can be calculated as @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the ferromagnetic @xmath44 ( @xmath43 ) coupling makes the @xmath16 ( @xmath9 ) plateau state stable , which is in contrast to the antiferromagnetic case .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we investigate the finite temperature transition to the plateau phases . to assess the nature of the finite temperature transition to the @xmath9 and @xmath16 plateau states , we calculate the temperature dependence of the specific heat , and the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ temp_spc ] . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat at @xmath82 has a single peak and the maximum value strongly diverges around @xmath83 for increasing the system size @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the phase transition from the paramagnetic phase to the @xmath9 plateau phase is of the first order . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the weak system size dependence in the model at @xmath85 seems to result from the second - order phase transition with a negative exponent @xmath86 .     and </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath85 . ]    to clarify the order of the finite temperature transition to the @xmath9 plateau phase , we calculate static structure factors both for bare spins @xmath87 and for bond spins </S>",

    "<S> this result also indicates the presence of the first - order transition . in the phenomenological renormalization - group treatment for the first - order transition@xcite , the bond - spin correlation ratio around the critical temperature scales as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a scaling function , @xmath93 , and the critical exponent @xmath94 is given by the inverse of the space dimensionality @xmath95 . from fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ spin_config ] ( d ) ) , we can expect @xmath98 symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> since the lowest energy state of the @xmath16 plateau phase is fourfold degenerated in context of the bare spin language , the universality class of this phase transition is naively expected to be the four - state - potts universality class ( the critical exponents are given by @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) . in fact , we confirm a single phase transition belonging to the four - state potts universality class in the ising limit case@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also possible that the @xmath98 symmetry breaks down in two separate steps as we see below .    by introducing the 90 degree lattice rotation `` @xmath101 '' around the center of a plaquette without diagonal coupling , </S>",

    "<S> we introduce two kinds of order parameters here . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking at @xmath103 can be characterized by a bond - spin `` staggered magnetization '' represented by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 takes @xmath109 depending on the position of the diagonal coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the other symmetry breaking at @xmath105 can be characterized by freezing the antiferromagnetic fluctuation on the diagonal bond @xmath19 , so that the order parameter is given by @xmath110 or @xmath111 . here </S>",

    "<S> since the @xmath2 symmetry breaking at @xmath103 is expected from the viewpoint of bond spin ordering , an intuitive speculation for the universality class of the phase transition leads us to expect the 2d ising universality class . </S>",
    "<S> we thus perform the data collapse assuming the scaling form @xmath115 and @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 . </S>",

    "<S> the universality class of the phase transition at @xmath105 is expected to be the same as that of the 2d ising model because the remaining symmetry @xmath122 is isomorphic to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the finite - size scaling analysis for the fourth order cumulant @xmath123 of @xmath120 can be achieved by using @xmath124 and @xmath117 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fss_second ] ( b2 ) . from the obtained results , </S>",

    "<S> we obtain the coupling ratios as @xmath133 and @xmath134 at @xmath132 with @xmath135[k]@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the field range of the @xmath16 plateau state does not depend on @xmath44 , although the @xmath44 coupling is important for the appearance of the @xmath16 plateau . furthermore we comment that this parameter set also gives a consistent nel temperature @xmath136[k ] at @xmath137 ( experimentally , it was @xmath138 9.6[k ] ) . in previous studies@xcite , it was clarified by the monte carlo calculations for the minimal ising model with @xmath139 that the plateaus except the @xmath9 plateau are not stabilized@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our estimation seems to be reasonable . </S>",
