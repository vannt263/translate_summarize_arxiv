    "these detectors , together with the space - based interferometers lisa , which is currently under construction and is expected to be launched around 2011 , can detect gravitational waves in different frequency ranges . as a consequence ,",
    "gravitational - wave astronomy that enables researchers to probe astronomical activities at extremely large distances from gravitational waves detected emerges as a new subject of interest @xcite .",
    "among all the possible sources of gravitational waves , pulsating neutron stars may probably be the most interesting one @xcite .",
    "it is believed that gravitational waves emitted in binary neutron mergers are plausibly detectable with the current technology and the frequency of detection could be as high as several hundreds per year after upgrading the present detectors @xcite .",
    "besides , waves generated in the formation of neutron stars via stellar core collapses might also be strong enough for detection provided that the collapse is sufficiently asymmetric @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , such gravitational waves are likely to carry the information about the internal structure of neutron stars from which they are emitted . as the structure of a neutron star , such as its radius and density distribution , certainly reflects the properties of nuclear and quark matters , a close examination of the wave signals",
    "is deemed rewarding @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves are commonly analyzed in terms of quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) , which properly describe damped harmonic pulsations .",
    "a qnm oscillation has a time dependence @xmath2 and is characterized by a complex eigenfrequency @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "moreover , to interpret such eos - independent generic behaviour , we use a simple stellar model  the tolman vii model ( tviim )  to approximate the mass distribution inside realistic neutron stars @xcite , and find that tviim is indeed a good approximation .",
    "we then look for the qnms of tviim with the scaled wave equation .",
    "interestingly enough , such qnms manifestly depend only on the compactness of the star and , in addition , demonstrate the scaling behaviour discovered in realistic neutron stars .",
    "therefore , the universality in the qnms ( @xmath0-mode and @xmath1-mode ) is ascribable to the fact that that the mass distribution of most realistic neutron stars can be well approximated by tviim .",

    "therefore , it is reasonable to conjecture that tviim is able to provide a good global approximation to the exact mass distribution .",
    "the conjecture is indeed confirmed by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ mass_0.28_2 ] , where the normalized mass distribution function @xmath54 is plotted against the scaled radius @xmath55 for stars described by different eos with a common compactness @xmath56 .",
    "it is manifest that @xmath36 obtained from stars with different eos are close to that of tviim , and similar conclusion has also been drawn recently by @xcite .",
    "this discovery suggests that the qnms of tviim could be close to those of realistic neutron stars .",
    "moreover , tviim has a distinct feature that gives rise to the universal behaviours observed in the @xmath0-mode qnms . introducing the scale transformations : @xmath57 we rewrite the tov equations as follows : @xmath58 these scaled tov equations have exactly the same forms as the original ones . in particular , for tviim the scaled mass distribution function is given by : @xmath59 it is clear that the function @xmath60 is solely characterized by the compactness @xmath20 and is independent of the mass @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , other scaled functions ( e.g. @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) associated with tviim depend only on @xmath20 as well . in fact",

    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mass_0.28_2 ] , tviim provides the simplest , yet robust , global approximation to @xmath36 .",

    "it is obvious the qnms of such hypothetically  dressed \" quark star , which have no discontinuities in their density profiles , also display the universality discussed in the present paper .",
    "we conclude that the scheme proposed above works properly as long as the star in consideration is characterized by a continuous density profile .",
    "furthermore , by virtue of the tov equations , the pressure is always a continuous function of @xmath37 and the density profile is continuous if relevant eos @xmath134 is a continuous function of @xmath135 . as a result ,",
    "deviation from the universal curve might indicate a discontinuous ( or rapidly varying ) eos .",
    "this effect can indeed be observed from the qnm frequencies of gm24 shown in fig .",
    "[ ldw_a2 ] and [ ldw_p2 ] .",
    "neutron stars constructed from gm24 will become unstable if @xmath136 owing to emergence of phase transition that leads to discontinuous ( or rapidly varying ) eos .",
    "correspondingly , qnm frequencies of gm24 stars no longer follow the those of tviim as its compactness approaches that limit .",
    "in this paper we have unveiled some universal scaling behaviours prevailing in qnm frequencies of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes . in addition , we have shown that these behaviours are attributable to the generic form of the mass distribution function .",
    "based on our discovery , a scheme is proposed here to infer the mass and the radius of an unknown star from its gravitational wave spectrum . despite that there might be some exceptional cases , e.g. bare strange stars , the scheme does provide reasonable estimate of relevant values in normal situation . as it has been shown that the mass and the radius of a neutron star can be used to infer the eos of stellar matter @xcite , our discussion will also lead to determination of eos from gravitational wave signals .",
    "the tviim considered here is a two - parameter model that is characterized by the mass and the radius of a star . while reproducing the main features of realistic stars",
    ", it can not capture the fine details in individual cases .",
    "should it be possible to gather more than one qnm frequency of a pulsating star , we could , in principle , construct more refined template for it .",
    "we are currently working along this direction and relevant result will be reported in due course .",
    "our analysis sketched above is based on assumption that qnms of gravitational waves are clearly discernible .",
    "however , it is well known that gravitational wave signals are usually overwhelmed by noises of various kinds , including thermal , quantum and gravity - gradient noises ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as yet there are no viable methods to completely eliminate these noises such that clear and reliable gravitational wave signals can be recorded . however , with the continuous efforts of researchers in this field , we will surely get rid of these noisy gremlins at a later date .",
    "thus , gravitational wave astronomy will open up a new channel to observe distant compact stars and the scheme outlined here will be applicable in the near future .",
