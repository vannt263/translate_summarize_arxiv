    "synchronization phenomena dates back to the period of huygens in 1665 , when he found that two very weakly coupled pendulum clocks , hanging from the same beam , become phase synchronized  @xcite .",
    "since the early identification of synchronization in chaotic oscillators  @xcite , the phenomenon has attracted considerable research activity in different areas of science  @xcite and several generalizations and interesting applications have been developed .",
    "chaos synchronization phenomenon is of interest not only from a theoretical point of view but also has potential applications in diverse subjects such as as biological , neurological , laser , chemical , electrical and fluid mechanical systems as well as in secure communication , cryptography and so on .",
    ". a recent review on the phenomenon of chaos synchronization can be found in the reference  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", different kinds of synchronization have been identified : complete ( or identical ) synchronization  @xcite , generalized synchronization  @xcite , phase synchronization  @xcite , lag synchronization  @xcite and anticipatory synchronization  @xcite . for a critical discussion on the interrelationship between various kinds of synchronization , we may refer to refs .",
    "transition from one kind of synchronization to the other , coexistence of different kinds of synchronization in time series and also the nature of transition have also been studied extensively  @xcite in coupled chaotic systems .",
    "one of the most important applications of chaos synchronization is secure communication .",
    "it is now an accepted fact that secure communication based on simple low dimensional chaotic systems does not ensure sufficient level of security , as the associated chaotic attractors can be reconstructed with some effort and the hidden message can be retrieved by an eavesdropper  @xcite .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to consider chaos synchronization in high dimensional systems having multiple positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "this increases security by giving rise to much more complex time series , which are apparently not vulnerable to the unmasking procedures generally .",
    "recently chaotic time - delay systems have been suggested as good candidates for secure communication  @xcite , as the time - delay systems are essentially infinite dimensional in nature and are described by delay differential equations , and that they can admit hyperchaotic attractors with large number of positive lyapunov exponents for suitable nonlinearity .",
    "therefore the study of chaos synchronization in the time - delay systems is of considerable practical significance .",
    "however , it should be noted that one has to be cautious due to the fact that even in time - delay systems with multiple positive lyapunov exponents unmasking may be possible .",
    "particularly , this is so if any reconstruction of the dynamics of the system is achieved in some appropriate space even for very high dimensional dynamics as demonstrated by zhou and lai @xcite in the case of mackey - glass equation .",
    "time - delay is ubiquitous in many physical systems due to finite switching speed of amplifiers , finite signal propagation time in biological networks , finite chemical reaction times , memory effects and so on  @xcite . in recent times ,",
    "considerable work has been carried out on the effect of time - delay in limit cycle oscillators  @xcite , time - delay feedback  @xcite , networks with time - delay coupling  @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , we have shown that even a single scalar delay equation with piecewise linear function can exhibit hyperchaotic behavior even for small values of time - delay  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of importance to consider the synchronization of chaos in such scalar piecewise linear delay differential systems with appropriate delay coupling .",
    "interestingly , in the present work we find that in such a coupled system , one can identify anticipatory , complete and lag synchronizations by simply tuning the second time - delay parameter in the coupling , for a fixed set of system parameters satisfying appropriate stability condition .",
    "the results have been corroborated by the nature of similarity functions , and transition behavior characterized by probability distribution of laminar phase during approximate synchronization which precedes the exact synchronization when a system parameter is varied .",
    "we also wish to point out that to our knowledge such transitions between all the three types of above synchronizations have not been reported in nonhyperchaotic systems and it appears that the present type of hyperchaotic systems are convenient tools to realize such transitions by tuning the delay parameters suitably .",
    "specifically , in this paper we will consider chaos synchronization of two single scalar piecewise - linear time - delay systems studied in the references  @xcite with unidirectional coupling between them and having two different time - delays : one in the coupling term and the other in the individual systems , namely , feedback delay .",
    "we have identified the stability condition for synchronization following krasovskii - lyapunov theory and demonstrate that there exists transition between three different kinds of synchronization , namely anticipatory , complete and lag synchronizations , as a function of time - delay in the coupling . to characterize the existence of anticipatory and lag synchronizations ,",
    "we have plotted the similarity function @xmath3 .",
    "we have also demonstrated that when the system parameter @xmath2 is varied , the onset of exact anticipatory / complete / lag synchronization from the desynchronized state is preceded by a region of approximate synchronized state .",
    "we also show that the later is characterized by a transition from on - off intermittency to a periodic structure in the laminar phase distribution , as suggested in the work of zhan et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of lag synchronization .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the unidirectionally coupled scalar time - delay system and identify the condition for stability of synchronized states . in sec .",
    "iii , we point out the existence of anticipatory synchronization when the strength of the coupling delay is less than feedback delay , while in sec .",
    "iv , complete synchronization is realized when the two delays are equal .",
    "lag synchronization is shown to set in when the coupling delay exceeds the feedback delay in sec .",
    "v. finally in sec .",
    "vi , we summarize our results .",
    "at first , we will introduce the single scalar time - delay system with piecewise linearity and bring out its hyperchaotic nature for suitable values of the system parameters .",
    "then the unidirectional delay coupling is introduced between two scalar systems and the stability condition for chaos synchronization is derived .",
    "we consider the following first order delay differential equation introduced by lu and he  @xcite and discussed in detail by thangavel et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parameters , @xmath7 is the time - delay and @xmath8 is an odd piecewise linear function defined as @xmath9 it is also of interest to consider additional forcing on the right hand side of eq .",

    "the corresponding pseudoattractor is shown in the fig .  2 . the hyperchaotic nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq.onea ] ) is confirmed by the existence of multiple positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "the first ten maximal lyapunov exponents for the parameters @xmath13 , as a function of time - delay @xmath7 is shown in fig .  3 , which are evaluated using the procedure suggested by j.  d.  farmer  @xcite .      now let us consider the following unidirectionally coupled drive @xmath14 and response @xmath15 systems with two different time - delays @xmath0 and @xmath1 as feedback and coupling time - delays , respectively ,    @xmath16    [ eq.one ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is of the same form as in eq .",
