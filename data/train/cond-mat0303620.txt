    "the nature of the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has drawn much attention since its discovery in 1994 .",
    "@xcite a lot of experiments have provided evidence that the superconductivity is unconventional .",
    "for instance , the superconductivity is extremely sensitive to the non - magnetic impurity scattering in contrast to anderson s theorem on a conventional superconductor .",
    "@xcite miyake and narikiyo have successfully shown that such an anomalous effect of impurity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 can be explained as an evidence of the spin - triplet pairing superconductivity .",
    "@xcite nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurement has revealed that the @xmath2o knight shift is almost unchanged in the transition into the superconducting phase .",
    "@xcite furthermore , muon spin relaxation ( @xmath3sr ) time measurement  @xcite and polarized - neutron scattering study  @xcite clarified that in the superconducting phase the time reversal symmetry is broken . from these experimental evidences",
    "it is almost confirmed that the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is the spin - triplet superconductivity . in the past few years",
    ", the momentum dependence of the superconducting gap function has become the central issue of this spin - triplet superconductor . in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the fermi surface consists of three cylindrical pieces mainly originated from the four ru-@xmath4 electrons in three @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "@xcite agterberg _",
    "_ insisted that the temperature dependences of specific heat , penetration depth , and thermal conductivity can be explained by the orbital dependent superconductivity .",
    "@xcite additionally , recent specific - heat measurement at low temperature suggests the existence of line nodes .",
    "@xcite    in order to determine the location of the nodes , we need the experimental results obtained by directional probes . in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "the magnetothermal conductivity measurement seems the most powerful tool to investigate the location of the nodes .",
    "@xcite two groups have reported that the thermal conductivity has no notable anisotropy when the magnetic field is applied to the direction parallel to the conducting plane .",
    "these results are quite different from the result of the cuprate superconductor , and they suggest that the pairing state with vertical line nodes has less possibility for the candidate in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . thus the paring state with horizontal line nodes seems to be appropriate to explain these experimental results for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "since sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has single - layered perovskite structure as in the case for la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath1 , it has been supposed that its superconductivity is mediated by largely enhanced fluctuations common to these two - dimensional materials .",
    "@xcite however , it seems difficult to explain the spin - triplet paring state with horizontal line node . in order to solve this problem , hasegawa _ et al .",
    "_ listed the possible odd - parity states on the basis of the group - theoretical analysis .",
    "@xcite in their analysis they took notice of the body - centered - tetragonal lattice of ru with lattice constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 . and they insisted that in order to stabilize the gap function with the horizontal line node the effective interaction for electrons at @xmath10 and @xmath11 is crucial .",
    "zhitomirsky and rice have successfully shown that the gap function with the horizontal line node may lead to the temperature dependence of the specific heat observed in experiments .",
    "@xcite futhermore , annett _ et al .",
    "_ have reproduced the experimental data of the superfluid density and the thermal conductivity on the basis of the multiband attractive hubbard model with interlayer coupling .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we propose that the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is mediated by coulomb scatterings among the electrons at @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "our model hamiltonian is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) three - band hubbard model with quasi - two - dimensional character .",
    "our microscopic description of the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 may be considered as an application of the two - band mechanism superconductivity to the spin - triplet cooper pairing ,  @xcite or as the three - dimensional version of the spin - triplet superconductivity in the one - dimensional chain with long - range attractive coulomb interactions .",

    "this may be caused by too large estimations of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "however , we think that this is mainly caused by the weak - coupling formalism and neglected quasiparticles lifetime . if the strong correlation effect decreases the lifetime , we should take into account the retardation effect and then @xmath54 will be smaller .",
    "in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 it is thought that the electrons correlate strongly with one another , and we should adopt the strong - coupling formalism for the quantitative estimation of @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite although our quantitative estimation of @xmath54 has these problems , as far as the whole electrons in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 compose the fermi liquid , our obtained gap symmetry can not be replaced by the other symmetries .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrated that the spin - triplet pairing mediated by the intersite coulomb scatterings is more stable than the spin - singlet one in our model .",
    "the gap function has a fourfold symmetry and horizontal line nodes on the fermi surface of each bands .",
    "these results appear qualitatively consistent with the experimental results .",
    "therefore the interlayer coulomb scatterings play a significant role in order to realize the spin - triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
