    "numerical ( `` exact '' ) diagonalizations ( ed ) of quantum many - body hamiltonians on finite clusters are often used to advance our understanding of larger lattices .",

    "many of the important many body hamiltonians of condensed matter ( e.g. hubbard and heisenberg models ) have short range interactions . as a consequence ,",
    "their ground states possess low entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "the idea of exploiting low entanglement entropy to compress wavefunctions by svd , is not new .",
    "this is the key to the remarkable success of density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite which has been used extensively to obtain low energy state correlations of a large variety of hamiltonians .",
    "dmrg is equivalent to variational minimization in the space of matrix product states  @xcite .",
    "extensions to wavefunctions with longer range correlations were given by multiscale entanglement renormalization  @xcite .",

    "this would amount to a significant compression of memory as compared to standard lanczos @xmath99 .",

    "in this paper we have exploited the svd to expand the lattice sizes which can be treated by the lanczos algorithm for ed . relative to standard lanczos , lanczos - svd demands longer computation time due to additional matrix manipulations .",
    "_ does the svd projection interfere with the lanczos convergence?_. the svd projection introduces a truncation error in the rotating vector .",

    "this rotation ceases once the energy has converged within the svd error .",
    "increasing @xmath1 will allow further convergence .",
    "it is simplest to think about the svd projection in the same footing as an additional floating point error which limits the numerical convergence of standard lanczos algorithms . in computing fig .",
    "[ err-36 ] we have indeed verified that the implementation of svd projection in each iteration , does not slow down the energy convergence per each lanczos step .",

    "currently the most time - consuming , are easily parallelizeable . in standard lanczos",
    ", memory reduction can be achieved by exploiting lattice and spin symmetries , which demands special boundary conditions and extensive programming .",
    "lanczos - svd is therefore simpler to implement , and can address arbitrary boundary conditions .    _",
    "it is often asked what advantage a lanczos based ed has over dmrg and related variational methods ? _",
    "the answer of course depends on the purpose of the calculation .",
    "dmrg has proven very efficient ( especially for ground state correlations ) for larger lattices than lanczos methods can address . however , in practical applications , dmrg advances toward the ground state by _ sequential _ minimizations , e.g. `` sweeping '' the parameters of the wave function in real space . in cases of high frustration and competing phases ( e.g. near a phase transition ) ,",
    "sweeping methods can get stuck in metastable states  @xcite .",
    "( consider e.g. the difficulty of getting rid of defects in a phase separated system by sweeping methods ) .    the lanczos step , on the other hand , does not necessarily move the state in the direction of maximal slope . instead ,",
    "if numerical accuracy is sufficient , it steadily rotates the lanczos vector toward the true ground state ( or some other target eigenstate ) .",
    "lanczos - svd can therefore be used to determine the ground state and low excitations of limited size clusters with well controlled accuracy .",
    "it could be used to check dmrg convergence and test variational ansatzes . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "a primary purpose for using ed on small clusters is to derive an effective hamiltonian by the core method@xcite .",
    "the core effective hamiltonian can then be studied on the coarse grained lattice by iterating core , or by variational methods .",
