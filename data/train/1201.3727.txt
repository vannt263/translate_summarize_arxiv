    "let @xmath104 be the rank function of @xmath103 . by a theorem of edmonds @xcite , for the rank of matroid unions , @xmath105    in @xcite , jordn used the matroid @xmath106 to prove theorem [ jordan_main ] and pointed out that using @xmath103 one could prove a theorem on packing of rigid spanning subgraphs and spanning trees .",
    "we tried to fulfill this gap by following the proof of @xcite but we failed . to achieve this aim we had to find a new proof technique .",
    "let us first demonstrate this technique by giving a transparent proof for theorems [ lo_ye ] and [ ja_jo ] .",
    "by ( [ rr ] ) , there exists a collection @xmath107 of subsets of @xmath23 such that @xmath108 partitions @xmath49 and @xmath109 . if @xmath110 then @xmath111 hence @xmath8 is rigid .",
    "so in the following we may assume that @xmath112 .",
    "since every edge of @xmath43 is induced by an element of @xmath53 , for @xmath118 , by definition of @xmath119 , no edge of @xmath43 contributes to @xmath120 ; and for a vertex @xmath121 , no edge of @xmath43 contributes to @xmath122 .",

    "we use the matroid @xmath146 defined above . choose @xmath43 a smallest - size set of edges that minimizes the right hand side of ( [ rs ] ) . by ( [ rr ] )",
    ", we can define @xmath53 a collection of subsets of @xmath23 such that @xmath54 partitions @xmath43 and @xmath147 since @xmath8 is a counterexample and by ( [ rr ] ) and ( [ rc ] ) , @xmath148 by @xmath57 , @xmath8 is connected , thus , by ( [ main_ineq ] ) , @xmath149 .",
    "recall the notations , for @xmath55 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 and the definition @xmath117 .",
    "denote @xmath150 the set of connected components of @xmath44 intersecting no set of @xmath151 . by remark [ xconnected ] , for @xmath118",
    ", @xmath42 induces a connected subgraph of @xmath44 , thus a connected component of @xmath44 intersecting @xmath118 contains @xmath42 and is the only connected component of @xmath44 containing @xmath42 .",
    "so by definition of @xmath150 , @xmath152      for @xmath118 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 . thus by @xmath0-connectivity of @xmath8 , for @xmath118 and for @xmath154 , @xmath155 since every edge of @xmath43 is induced by an element of @xmath53 and by definition of @xmath119 , for @xmath118 , no edge of @xmath43 contributes to @xmath120 .",
    "each @xmath154 is a connected component of the graph @xmath44 , thus no edge of @xmath43 contributes to @xmath156 .",
    "hence , by ( [ connect1 ] ) , ( [ connect2 ] ) , ( [ connect3 ] ) and @xmath59 , we obtain the required lower bound on @xmath157 , @xmath158 @xmath159      by definition of @xmath151 , @xmath161 for all @xmath162 .",
    "so to prove the claim it suffices to show that every @xmath55 satisfies @xmath163 .",
    "suppose there exists @xmath164 such that @xmath165 . by remark",
    "[ xconnected ] and since @xmath8 is simple , @xmath166 induces exactly one edge @xmath167 .",

    "hence by ( [ rin ] ) , ( [ lin ] ) , the definition of @xmath171 , @xmath165 , and @xmath57 , we have the following contradiction : @xmath176 @xmath159        let @xmath80 .",
