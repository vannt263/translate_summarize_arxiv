    "there are three ways in which one can introduce prioritisation into a polling model .",
    "the first type of priority is by changing the server routing such that certain queues are visited more frequently than other queues @xcite .",
    "this type of prioritisation is quite common in wireless network protocols .",
    "a second type of prioritisation is through differentiation of the number of customers that are served during each visit to a queue .",
    "this type of prioritisation is inflicted through the usage of different service disciplines .",
    "for example , one can serve all customers in a queue before switching to the next queue ( exhaustive service ) , or one can limit the amount of customers that are served to , e.g. , only those customers present at the arrival of the server at the queue ( gated service ) . typically , this will have a negative impact on the waiting times of the customers in queues that are not served exhaustively .",
    "the third way of introducing priorities is by changing the order in which customers are served within a queue , which is a popular technique to improve performance of production systems , cf .",
    "the present paper introduces a new service discipline , referred to as mixed gated / exhaustive service , that combines the last two types of prioritisation .    in the polling model considered in the present paper a single server visits @xmath0 queues in a fixed , cyclic order .",
    "some , or even all , of the queues contain two types of customers : high and low priority customers .",
    "for these queues we introduce a new service discipline , called mixed gated / exhaustive service based on the priority level of the customer .",
    "a polling system with high and low priority customers in a queue with purely gated or exhaustive service has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the mixed gated / exhaustive service discipline can be considered as a mixture of these two service disciplines where low priority customers receive gated service and high priority customers receive exhaustive service .",
    "a more detailed description is given in section [ modeldescription ] .",
    "since the number of customers served during one visit in a queue with gated service is different from the number served during a visit with exhaustive service , the mixed gated / exhaustive service discipline introduced in the present paper combines the second and the third type of prioritisation .",
    "a variation of the model under consideration , namely a polling system where low priority customers are served only if there are no high priority customers present _ in any of the queues _",
    ", has been studied in @xcite .",
    "polling models have been studied for many years and because of their practical relevance many papers on polling systems have been written in a mixture of application areas .",
    "the survey of takagi @xcite on polling systems and their applications from 1991 is still very valuable , although the last couple of years interest in polling models has revived , partly triggered by many new applications .",
    "the motivation for the present paper is to present a service discipline that combines the benefits of the gated and exhaustive service disciplines for priority polling models .",
    "the specific application that attracted our attention is in the field of logistics .",
    "consider a make - to - order production system with a single production capacity for multiple products .",
    "in many firms encountering this situation , the products are produced according to a fixed production sequence .",
    "the production capacity , where the production orders queue up , can be represented as a polling model by identifying each product with a queue and the demand process of a product with the arrival process at the corresponding queue . for a more detailed description of fixed - sequence strategies in the context of make - to - stock production situations ,",
    "see @xcite . in the context of this production",
    "setting , the situation with two or more priority levels - as studied in detail in the present paper - is oftentimes encountered in practice , where production departments have to supply both internal and external customers , the latter of which is commonly given a preferential treatment .",
    "a different application stems from production scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems where part types are often grouped with other types sharing ( almost ) similar characteristics , such that no change of machine configuration , i.e. setup time , is required when switching between these part types ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . since no setup time is required to switch between these types , it can be seen as customers of different types being served in the same queue .",
    "the introduction of priorities can be useful to efficiently differentiate between different parts grouped within one queue .",
    "these two applications make the practical relevance of the inclusion of multiple priority levels in the studied polling model evident .",
    "finally , we should keep in the back of our mind that the results of the present paper are certainly not limited to these production settings , but may be used in many other fields where polling models arise , such as communication , transportation and health care ( e.g. , surgery procedures where an urgency parameter is assigned to each patient ) .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows : first we discuss the model in more detail and we determine the generating functions ( gfs ) of the joint queue length distribution of all customers at visit beginnings and completions of each queue . in section [ cycletimesection ]",
    "we determine the laplace - stieltjes transforms ( lsts ) of the distributions of the cycle time , visit times and intervisit times .",
    "these distributions are used to determine the marginal queue length distributions and waiting time distributions of high and low priority customers in all queues .",
    "the lst of the waiting time distribution is used to compute the mean waiting time of each customer type . a pseudo - conservation law for these mean waiting times is presented in section [ pseudoconservationlawprioritiessection ] .",
    "furthermore , we introduce some numerical examples to illustrate typical features of a polling model with mixed gated / exhaustive service .",
    "finally we discuss possible extensions and future research on the topic .",
    "the model considered in the present paper is a polling model which consists of @xmath0 queues , labelled @xmath1 . throughout the whole paper",
    "all indices are modulo @xmath0 , so @xmath2 stands for @xmath3 .",
    "the queues are visited by one server in a fixed , cyclic order : @xmath4 . the switch - over time of the server from @xmath5 to @xmath6",
    "is denoted by @xmath7 with lst @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that all switch - over times are independent and at least one switch - over time is strictly greater than zero .",
    "each queue contains two customer types : high and low priority customers , although the analysis allows any number ( greater than zero ) of customer types per queue .",
    "high priority customers in @xmath5 are called type @xmath9 customers and low priority customers in @xmath5 are called @xmath10 customers , @xmath11 .",
    "type @xmath9 customers arrive at @xmath5 according to a poisson process with intensity @xmath12 , and type @xmath10 customers arrive at @xmath5 according to a poisson process with intensity @xmath13 .",
    "the service times of type @xmath9 and @xmath10 customers are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with lsts @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "all service times are assumed to be independent .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath18 and similarly @xmath19 .",
    "the total occupation rate of the system is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fraction of time that the server visits @xmath5 .",
    "service of the customers is gated for low priority customers and exhaustive for high priority customers . in more detail : each queue actually contains two lines of waiting customers : one for the low priority customers and one for the high priority customers . at the beginning of a visit to @xmath5 , a gate is set behind the low priority customers to mark them eligible for service .",
    "high priority customers are always served exhaustively until no high priority customer is present .",
    "when no high priority customers are present in the queue , the low priority customers standing in front of the gate are served in order of arrival , but whenever a high priority customer enters the queue , he is served before any waiting low priority customers .",
    "service is non - preemptive though , implying that service of a type @xmath10 customer is not interrupted by an arriving type @xmath9 customer .",
    "the visit to @xmath5 ends when all type @xmath10 customers present at the beginning of this visit are served and no high priority customers are present in the queue .",
    "notice that if the arrival intensity @xmath12 equals @xmath22 , then @xmath5 is served completely according to the gated service discipline .",
    "similarly we can set @xmath23 to obtain a purely exhaustively served queue . both the gated and the exhaustive service discipline fall into the category of branching - type service disciplines .",
    "these are service disciplines that satisfy the following property , introduced by resing @xcite and fuhrmann @xcite .",
    "[ resingproperty ] if the server arrives at @xmath5 to find @xmath24 customers there , then during the course of the server s visit , each of these @xmath24 customers will effectively be replaced in an i.i.d . manner by a random population having probability generating function @xmath25 , which can be any @xmath0-dimensional probability generating function .",
    "if @xmath5 receives gated service , we have @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the service time lst of an arbitrary customer in @xmath5 , and @xmath28 denotes his arrival rate . for exhaustive service @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the lst of a busy period distribution in an @xmath31 system with only type @xmath32 customers ,",
    "so it is the root in @xmath33 $ ] of the equation @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , p. 250 ) .",
    "property [ resingproperty ] is not satisfied if @xmath5 receives mixed gated / exhaustive service , because the random population that replaces each of these customers depends on the priority level . in the next section",
    "we circumvent this problem by splitting each queue into two virtual queues , each of which has a branching - type service discipline .",
    "this equivalent polling system satisfies property [ resingproperty ] , so we can still use the methodology described in @xcite to find , e.g. , the joint queue length distribution at visit beginnings and completions .",
    "all other probability distributions that are derived in the present paper can be expressed in terms of ( one of ) these joint queue length distributions .",
    "in the present section we analyse a polling system with all queues having two priority levels and receiving mixed gated / exhaustive service , but in fact each queue would be allowed to have any branching - type service discipline .",
    "denote the gf of the joint queue length distribution of type @xmath36 customers at the beginning and the completion of a visit to @xmath5 by respectively @xmath37 and @xmath38 . as discussed in the previous section , the polling model under consideration",
    "does not satisfy property [ resingproperty ] , which often means that an exact analysis is difficult or even impossible .",
    "for this reason we introduce a different polling system that does satisfy property [ resingproperty ] and has the same joint queue length distribution at visit beginnings and endings .",
    "the equivalent system contains @xmath39 queues , denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "the switch - over times @xmath7 , @xmath11 , are incurred when the server switches from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ; there are no switch - over times between @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "customers in this system are so - called `` smart customers '' , introduced in @xcite , meaning that the arrival rate of each customer type depends on the location of the server .",
    "type @xmath44 customers arrive in @xmath43 according to arrival rate @xmath12 _ unless the server is serving @xmath41_. when the server is serving @xmath41 , the arrival rate of type @xmath44 customers is 0 .",
    "the reason for this is that we incorporate the service times of all type @xmath9 customers that would have arrived during the service of a type @xmath10 customer , in the original polling model , into the service time of a type @xmath45 customer . in our alternative system ,",
    "type @xmath45 customers arrive with intensity @xmath13 and have service requirement @xmath46 with lst @xmath47 .",
    "there is a simple relation between @xmath15 and @xmath46 , expressed in terms of the lst : @xmath48 @xmath46 is often called _ completion time _ in the literature , cf .",
    "@xcite , with mean @xmath49 .",
    "service is exhaustive for @xmath50 and synchronised gated for @xmath51 , the gate of @xmath41 being set at the visit beginning of @xmath43 .",
    "the synchronised gated service discipline is introduced in @xcite and does not strictly satisfy property [ resingproperty ] .",
    "however , it _ does _ satisfy a slightly modified version of property [ resingproperty ] that still allows for straightforward analysis ; see @xcite for more details . during a visit to @xmath41 only those type @xmath45 customers",
    "are served that were present at the previous visit beginning to @xmath43 .",
    "the joint queue length distribution at a visit beginning of @xmath43 in this system is the same as the joint queue length distribution at a visit beginning of @xmath52 in the original polling system .",
    "similarly , the joint queue length distribution at a visit completion of @xmath41 is the same as the joint queue length distribution at a visit completion of @xmath52 in the original polling system . in terms of the gfs : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a shorthand notation for the vector @xmath55 .",
    "the gfs of the joint queue length distributions at a visit beginning and completion of @xmath43 are related in the following manner : @xmath56 with @xmath57 . similarly : @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 since there is no switch - over time between @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "there is a switch - over time between @xmath41 and @xmath42 though : @xmath61 now that we can relate @xmath62 to @xmath63 , we can repeat these steps @xmath0 times to obtain a recursive expression for @xmath63 .",
    "this recursive expression is sufficient to compute all moments of the joint queue length distribution at a visit beginning to @xmath43 by differentiation , but the expression can also be written as an infinite product which converges if and only if @xmath64 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "we define the cycle time @xmath65 as the time between two successive visit beginnings to @xmath5 , @xmath11 .",
    "the lst of the distribution of @xmath65 , denoted by @xmath66 , can be expressed in terms of @xmath67 because the type @xmath10 customers that are present at the beginning of a visit to @xmath52 are those type @xmath10 customers that have arrived during the previous cycle .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the arguments that correspond respectively to type @xmath9 and @xmath10 customers . using this notation",
    "we can write : @xmath71 .",
    "hence , the lst of the cycle time distribution is : @xmath72 note that @xmath73 , which does not depend on @xmath32 .",
    "higher moments of the cycle time distribution _ do _",
    "depend on the cycle starting point .",
    "we define the intervisit time @xmath74 as the time between a visit completion of @xmath5 and the next visit beginning of @xmath5 .",
    "the type @xmath9 customers present at the beginning of a visit to @xmath5 are exactly those type @xmath9 customers that arrived during the previous intervisit time @xmath74 .",
    "hence , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the lst of the distribution of @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the lst of the intervisit time distribution of @xmath5 : @xmath77 it is intuitively clear that @xmath78 .",
    "the lsts of the distributions of the cycle time and intervisit time are needed later in this paper . for the visit time of @xmath5 , @xmath79 ,",
    "we mention the lst here for completeness but it will not be used later : @xmath80 it is easy to verify that @xmath81 .",
    "since high priority customers are served exhaustively , we can use the concept of delay - cycles , sometimes called @xmath82-cycles ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , introduced by kella and yechiali @xcite for vacation models to find the waiting time lst of a type @xmath9 customer , where _ waiting time _ is understood as the time between arrival of a customer into the system and the moment when the customer is taken into service",

    "a delay - cycle for a type @xmath9 customer is a cycle that starts with a certain initial delay at the moment that the last type @xmath9 customer in the system has been served . in our model",
    "this initial delay is either the service of a type @xmath10 customer , @xmath15 , or ( if no type @xmath10 customer is present ) an intervisit period @xmath74 .",

    "when comparing the mixed gated / exhaustive strategy to a system with purely exhaustive service in @xmath3 , we conclude that the improvement is not so much in the mean waiting time for high priority customers , but mostly in the mean and variance of the waiting time for customers in @xmath123 .",
