    "methods for reverse - engineering transcription regulatory networks from high - throughput microarray data come in many different flavors @xcite . an important class of methods are those which not only seek to identify the topological wiring of the network @xcite , but also attempt to infer a model of the biological system which explains the observed gene expression patterns and generates testable hypotheses . such models can take the form of probabilistic graphical models @xcite , simplified kinetic equation models @xcite , or biophysical models @xcite .",
    "a common property of all modeling approaches is that the number of parameters is much larger than the number of experimental data points available to define them .",
    "dimensionality reduction is usually achieved by a coarse - graining step which collapses individual genes into clusters of coexpressed genes or modules , where all genes in a cluster share the same model parameters @xcite .",
    "this conceptual simplification has as a drawback that inferred interactions are influenced by the module quality .",
    "moreover , it is hard to translate the concept of a biological module in a strict mathematical definition .",
    "when searching for modules , often many local optima exist with partially overlapping modules differing from each other in a few genes or conditions .",
    "therefore , in our approach we exploit the `` fuzzy '' property of a module to increase the reliability of the predicted interactions . instead of reporting only one cluster solution ( local optimum )",
    ", we use a stochastic approach to generate many partially redundant cluster solutions ( bootstrapping ) and generate an ensemble solution by averaging over multiple high - scoring models .",
    "crucial for the success of the ensemble approach is the availability of an efficient method for sampling a large number of different models covering the whole search space of possible models @xcite .",
    "therefore we use the deterministic approach of @xcite as a basis for our sampling method . in this approach gene and condition clustering",
    "are decoupled from learning the regulatory programs compared to the original method of @xcite which optimizes both simultaneously .",
    "this allows for a higher efficiency while maintaining an equal performance rate @xcite .",
    "several extensions of the method of @xcite infer transcriptional modules from gene expression and genome wide location analyis @xcite .",
    "it is entirely feasible to develop ensemble strategies for these methods as we did for @xcite .",
    "this constitutes an interesting line of future research . in this paper",
    "we give a brief description of the algorithm and highlight some results for an expression compendium for _ e. coli _ @xcite . a complete analysis of this data",
    "set and comparison of our approach to the mutual information based clr method @xcite is given in @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison between the ensemble approach and the direct - optimization based method of @xcite on _ s. cerevisiae _ data is given in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm takes as input a gene expression data set and a list of candidate regulators .",
    "it gives as output a large number of probabilistic models consisting of a set of gene clusters , with for each gene cluster a partition of the experiments and a probabilistic regulatory program explaining the observed experiment partitions in terms of the expression of a small number of regulators .",
    "the number of gene and experiment clusters is determined automatically and can vary from one solution to the next . using overrepresentation in the ensemble",
    ", the most probable interactions can be identified .",
    "the regulatory programs can be validated on new experimental data and generate testable hypotheses about conditional regulation of the inferred gene clusters .",
    "the first step of the algorithm consists of generating an ensemble of gene clusters with experiment partitions .",
    "a gibbs sampling method iteratively updates the assignment of each gene given the current gene and experiment clusters , and the assignment of each experiment in each gene cluster given the current assignment of all other experiments in that gene cluster , iterating until a stationary state is reached .",
    "details about the gibbs sampler algorithm and a complete analysis of its convergence properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "briefly , in a single run , the gibbs sampler reaches a local optimum in the direction of genes , but covers the whole search space in the direction of experiments .",
    "this implies that for a given cluster of coexpressed genes there are multiple equiprobable ways of partitioning the experiments . to also sample from the whole search space in the direction of genes ,",
    "we perform several independent gibbs sampler runs with random restarts . in @xcite , it is shown that each of the local optima in the direction of genes is ( approximately ) of the same height , and therefore equally important , and that a relatively small number of local optima is sufficient to cover the whole search space ( typically two distinct sets of 10 local optima for a data set of 1000 genes agree for 95% on the probability for each pair of genes to be clustered together , see @xcite for details ) . a graphical cartoon representation of the gibbs sampling procedure",
    "is given in figure [ fig : gibbs ] .",
    "in the second step of the algorithm , regulatory programs are learned for each experiment partition for each gene cluster .",
    "this is achieved by linking the sets in the experiment partition hierarchically in a decision tree . for each split in this tree a candidate regulator",
    "is found whose expression is significantly different on both sides of the split , as measured by an entropy measure .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .        a gene cluster with a regulatory program",
    "is called a _ transcriptional module _ and a partition of all genes into clusters , each with a regulatory program , a _ module network_. a sample module is shown in figure [ fig : module ] . to each module network",
    "corresponds a probabilistic model defined by a probability density function @xmath0 with @xmath1 the continuous valued expression level of gene @xmath2 ( see methods ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 measures how well the model explains a particular experiment with expression levels for all genes .",
    "we have applied the algorithm on a compendium of affymetrix microarrays for _",
    "e.  coli _ @xcite .",
    "the compendium contains 445 expression profiles for 4345 genes under 189 different stress conditions and genetic perturbations .",
    "the results are validated by comparison with existing knowledge of transcriptional interactions in regulondb @xcite and ecocyc @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis of the inferred module networks and their biological significance is beyond the scope of this paper and will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we highlight a few examples of inferred interactions which are representative for the working mechanism of the ensemble approach .",
    "a first example is given by the _",
    "gatyzabcd _ operon ( involved in galactitol metabolism ) . as expected the genes in this operon consistently cluster together .",
    "gatr_2 , a subunit of the gatr transcriptional repressor , is consistently assigned as a candidate regulator .",
    "it is known that gatr negatively controls transcription initiation of the _ gatyzabcd _ operon , which is the only known target of gatr according to regulondb .",
    "the many local optima , generated by the gibbs sampling approach resulted in 81 additional genes which were clustered at least once with one of the _ gatyzabcd _ genes . except for one potential new target _ trec _ which was found repeatedly in combination with _",
    "gatc _ and _ gatd _ , the interactions between the remaining 80 genes and gatr were not sufficiently significant to be retained in the final solution .",
    "this illustrates how the ensemble approach guarantees an effective filtering of false positives while retaining the true positives .",
    "this example also illustrates how combinatorial regulation can be detected . for _ gaty",
    "_ , _ gatz _ , _ gata _ and _ gatb _ , a second regulator , yeat ( a predicted regulator involved in malate metabolism ) , with an anticorrelated expression pattern seemed to play a role in a subset of the conditions ( see figure [ fig : module ] ) .",
    "four interactions could be inferred for gadx ( a transcriptional activator involved in acid resistance ) : gadx itself , which makes sense as it is known to be autoregulated @xcite , and three novel targets _ slp _ , _ gadw _ and _ yhid_. this finding is supported by literature , as the expression of both _",
    "slp _ @xcite and _ yhid _",
    "@xcite seemed to be affected in a _",
    "gadx _ mutant , while _ gadx _ and _ gadw _ seem to tightly control each other s expression @xcite .    for lrp ( a regulator involved in the high - affinity transport of branched - chain amino acids and a mediator of the leucine response )",
    "44 interactions could be found of which 5 could be confirmed by regulondb ( _ ilvi _ , _ ilvh _ , _ livg _ , _ livm _ and _ livn _ ) and 39 were new . among the predicted interactions with lrp we found the _ leulabcd _ genes . according to literature , the lrp dependent regulation of the _ leulabcd _",
    "operon is only indirect @xcite .",
    "however , without additional data , no distinction can be made between direct and indirect effects of a regulator if both give rise to a correlated expression level with the targets .",
    "four of our predicted targets ( _ purm _ , _ arga _ , _ yhje _ and _ arop _ ) were tested by chip analysis @xcite and three ( _ purm _ , _ arga _ and _ yhje _ ) were confirmed .",
    "_ yhje _ was also found to be differentially expressed in a microarray analysis of _ lrp _ mutants @xcite . for the remaining genes no clear indication for their regulation by lrp could be found .",
    "however , it should be noted that lrp not only acts as a regulator , binding specific dna - sequences , but also functions as a dna - organizing protein , extending its global role in regulation @xcite .",
    "a large regulon of lrp , as was detected by our method , thus is in line with this more global role of lrp .",
    "one of the purposes of model - based reverse - engineering methods is to infer a model of the system which extends beyond the data set used to learn the model . as such they can form the basis for developing methods which use new data to refine and",
    "extend a partially validated model , rather than infer a completely new network model each time a data set is updated .",
    "validation of a model is done by comparing the distribution of @xmath3 ( see methods ) for new data with the distribution for data used to learn the model . in general , higher values of @xmath4 means better explanation of the data by the model .",
    "the result of this comparison for 75 experiments recently added to the @xmath5 database @xcite with the 189 original experiments , for 100 module network models selected at random from the ensemble , is shown in figure [ fig : eval ] .",
    "the overlap between the distributions shows that the probabilistic models indeed generalize to unseen data . for comparison",
    "we also perform a randomization test by permuting the gene indices of the data matrix . as expected , the evaluation of the models on randomized data is several orders of magnitude smaller than on real data , and in fact around 15% of the randomized experiments have a value @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ , zero likelihood .     for 100 models in the ensemble , for the original data ( red ) , new data ( blue ) , and randomized data ( green , around 15% zero likelihood values ( @xmath7 ) not shown ) .",
    "we downloaded a compendium of expression profiles for _ e.  coli _ @xcite and a list of @xmath8 candidate regulators from http://gardnerlab.bu.edu / netinfer_plos_2007/. we averaged over replicate experiments to obtain a data matrix of 4345 genes and 189 experiments .",
    "additional data for 4292 genes and 75 experiments for validation of the probabilistic models was downloaded from http://m3d.bu.edu / norm/.      the probabilistic model introduced in @xcite associates to each gene @xmath2 a continuous valued random variable @xmath9 measuring the gene s expression level .",
    "the distribution of @xmath9 depends on the expression level of a set of parent genes chosen from a list of candidate regulators .",
    "genes regulated by the same parents form a cluster and share the same model parameters .",
    "the joint probability distribution for the expression levels of all genes decomposes as a product of conditional distributions , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of clusters ( _ i.e. _ , a partition of the gene set @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 is the set of regulators for cluster @xmath14 . the distribution is normalized if the network from parents to children is acyclic .",
    "the conditional distribution @xmath15 of the expression level of the genes in cluster @xmath14 is a normal distribution with parameters determined by the expression levels of the parents @xmath13 : @xmath16 the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are determined by arranging the parents in a decision tree .",
    "the tests on the nodes of the decision tree are of the form ` @xmath19 ? ' for some threshold value @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the expression value of the parent @xmath22 associated to the node .",
    "the leaves @xmath23 of the decision tree are the sets of an experiment partition for cluster @xmath14 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mean , resp .",
    "precision of the expression levels of the genes in the cluster in this subset of experiments .",
    "see @xcite for more details .    to evaluate a model of the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we are only interested in genes for which the model makes actual predicitions , _",
    "i.e. _ , genes belonging to clusters with a regulation tree .",
    "if the clustering procedure does not find distinct experiment clusters for a certain gene cluster , the model predicts one broad normal distribution for the genes in this cluster .",
    "any expression data for these genes will fit the model and thereby obscure the signal of the genes for which true predictions are made . for the particular data used in section [ sec : model - eval ] ,",
    "the number of genes in the new data set is 4292 vs. 4345 in the data used to learn the models .",
    "six of the missing genes belong to the regulator list for the learned models .",
    "hence in some models we may not be able to compute the conditional probability distributions for all genes .",
    "altogether around 2700 genes remain for each model .",
