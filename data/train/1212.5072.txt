    "a planar map is an embedding of a finite connected graph into the two  sphere .",
    "two planar maps are considered to be the same if one can be mapped to the other with an orientation  preserving homeomorphism of the sphere .",
    "the connected components of the complement of the edges of the graph are called faces .",
    "the degree of a vertex is the number of edges containing it and the degree of a face is the number of edges in its boundary where an edge is counted twice if both its sides are incident to the face .    in recent years",
    "there has been great progress in understanding probabilistic aspects of large planar maps , we refer to @xcite for a detailed overview .",
    "one approach has been to study the scaling limit of a sequence of random planar maps obtained by rescaling the graph distance on the maps appropriately with their size and taking the limit as the size goes to infinity .",
    "this notion of convergence involves viewing the maps as elements of the set of all compact metric spaces , up to isometries , equipped with the gromov ",
    "hausdorff topology .",
    "le gall showed that the scaling limit of uniform @xmath2angulations ( all faces of degree @xmath2 ) exists along a suitable subsequence and he furthermore showed that its topology is independent of the subsequence and proved that its hausdorff dimension equals 4 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , le gall and paulin proved that the limit has the topology of the sphere @xcite .",
    "recently , miermont showed that in the case of uniform quadrangulations the choice of subsequence is superfluous and the scaling limit in fact equals the so  called _ brownian map _ up to a scale factor @xcite .",
    "le gall proved independently that the same holds in the case of uniform @xmath2angulations @xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by a paper of le gall and miermont @xcite where the authors study random planar maps which roughly have the property that the distribution of the degree of a typical face is in the domain of attraction of a stable law with index @xmath3 .",
    "the model belongs to a class of models in which boltzmann weights are assigned to the faces of the map as we will now describe .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the set of rooted and pointed bipartite planar maps having @xmath0 edges : the root is an oriented edge @xmath5 and pointed means that there is a marked vertex @xmath6 in the planar map .",
    "the assumption of pointedness is for technical reasons . for a planar map @xmath7 ,",
    "denote the set of faces in @xmath8 by @xmath9 and denote the degree of a face @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "note that the assumption that @xmath8 is bipartite is equivalent to assuming that @xmath11 is even for all @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a sequence of non - negative numbers and assign a boltzmann weight @xmath14 to @xmath8 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath15 is defined by normalizing @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is referred to as the finite volume partition function .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath19 for some @xmath20 to avoid the trivial case when all faces have degree 2 .",
    "note that for a given random element in @xmath21 distributed by @xmath15 the marked vertex @xmath6 is uniformly distributed .",
    "the motivation for studying these distributions is first of all related to questions of universality , namely , there is strong evidence that under certain integrability condition on the weights @xmath22 the scaling limit of the maps distributed by @xmath15 is the brownian map up to a scale factor @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the distributions are closely related to distributions arising in certain statistical mechanical models on random maps as is discussed in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show , among other things , that in the large planar maps under consideration there are many `` macroscopic '' faces present and that the scaling limit , if it exists , is different from the brownian map .",
    "the presence of these large faces in the scaling limit can be understood by considering the labeled trees ( mobiles ) obtained from the planar maps using the bouttier  di francesco ",
    "guitter ( bdg ) bijection @xcite , see section [ s : bdg ] . for convenience",
    "we rewrite the sequence @xmath13 in terms of a new sequence @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 through yet another bijection between mobiles ( with labels removed ) and trees which we introduce in section [ s : anotherb ] , the random trees corresponding to the maps distributed by @xmath15 can be viewed as so ",
    "called _ simply generated trees _ with weights @xmath26 assigned to vertices of outdegree @xmath27 .",

    "watson tree having infinite variance . in this case",
    "the random trees converge , when scaled appropriately , to the so  called stable tree with index @xmath28 .",
    "it follows from properties of the bdg bijection that the large faces in the planar maps correspond to individuals in the stable tree which have a macroscopic number of offspring , i.e.  vertices of large degree .",
    "it was originally noted in @xcite and recently developed further in @xcite that there exists a phase of simply generated trees where a unique vertex with a degree proportional to the size of the tree appears as the trees get large .",
    "this phenomenon has been referred to as condensation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the scaling limit of planar maps corresponding to the condensation phase of the simply generated trees .",
    "the large vertex in the trees will produce a large face in the planar maps in analogy with the situation in @xcite .",
    "the weights which we consider are chosen as explained below .",

    "secondly we prove the following theorem , which describes the limit of all distances ( not just to the root ) .",
    "[ th : main ] for the weights and the random planar maps + @xmath59 distributed by @xmath15 and viewed as elements of @xmath46 converge in distribution to @xmath60 , where given @xmath61 , @xmath62 is a marked vertex chosen uniformly at random from @xmath61 .",
    "[ t ]    note that the root edge in @xmath63 is forgotten when we regard the maps as elements of @xmath46 .",
    "we can reroot the random tree @xmath64 at the randomly chosen point @xmath62 ; this gives a new random rooted tree , which has the same distribution as @xmath64 , as shown by ( * ? ? ? * ( 20 ) ) , but the point @xmath62 is now the root .",
    "hence the result in theorem  [ th : main ] can also be formulated as follows :    for the weights and the random planar maps in theorem  [ th : main ] converge in distribution in @xmath65 to @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the root of @xmath61 .",

    "moreover , the variance of the offspring distribution is @xmath631 which in the critical case @xmath629 can be written by as @xmath632 which in the notation of @xcite is @xmath633 .",

    "thus the offspring distribution for the black vertices has the probability generating function @xmath638 a simple calculation ( which essentially is ( * ? ? ?",

    "restricting to trees with @xmath0 edges ( and thus @xmath639 vertices ) we see , by remark  [ rlika ] , that the tree @xmath255 in section  [ s : anotherb ] with distribution @xmath232 can be seen as @xmath616 conditioned on @xmath640 , and thus the corresponding tree @xmath641 has the same distribution as @xmath76 conditioned on @xmath642 .",
    "although the galton  watson tree @xmath616 is simpler than the two - type tree @xmath76 , the latter is more convenient for some purposes .",
    "for example , when considering the white vertices , as we do in parts of section  [ s : anotherb ] , it is immediate ( by considering each second generation ) that the number of white vertices in @xmath616 is distributed as the total progeny ( number of vertices ) in a galton  watson tree with offspring distribution @xmath643 where @xmath644 and @xmath645 are independent of each other and of @xmath646 , and each @xmath647 has the distribution @xmath614 .",

    "watson tree @xmath616 with offspring distribution @xmath637 is distributed as the total progeny of a galton  watson process with offspring distribution @xmath651 .",
    "in fact , this was shown by minami @xcite ; one version of his argument is the following .",
    "given a tree @xmath76 we partition its vertex set into _ twigs _ as follows : take the vertices in lexicographic order and stop each time we reach a leaf .",
    "i.e. , the first twig consists of the root and all vertices up to , and including , the first leaf ; the second twig starts at the next vertex and ends at the next leaf , and so on .",
    "thus each twig ends with a leaf , and the number of twigs equals the number of leaves . if we start with a random galton  watson tree @xmath616 with offspring distribution @xmath655 , the size of each twig has a geometric distribution @xmath656 with @xmath657 as above . moreover , each non - leaf in the twig has further offspring distributed as @xmath658 ; hence , if we contract each twig to a single vertex , we obtain a new random galton  watson tree with offspring distributed as @xmath651 ;",
    "the number of vertices in this tree equals the number of twigs in @xmath616 , and thus the number of leaves in @xmath616 .",
    "in fact , these two arguments are essentially the same ; if we use instead the reverse lexicographic order when defining the twigs , it is easy to see that each twig in @xmath616 correspond to a white vertex and its ( black ) children in @xmath76 .",
