    "indeed , there are indications that the jet structure is not as simple as that assumed above .",
    "there is compelling observational evidence that the jet of low  power tev blazars could be structured ( e.g. giroletti 2008 ) , with a fast ( with bulk lorentz factor @xmath15 ) central spine , surrounded by a slower ( @xmath16 ) layer .",
    "a structure of this type is also required to unify bl lacs objects with the parent population of fri radiogalaxies ( chiaberge et al .",

    "( 2005 ) this model can account for the vhe emission of tev detected blazars ( thought to be produced in the spine ) and predicts that the weakly beamed emission of the layer could dominate the emission from misaligned radiogalaxies .",
    "this scheme was successfully applied to the modeling of the sed of the first radiogalaxy detected at vhe , m87 ( tg08 ) .",
    "the same idea is at the base of the decelerating jet scenario , in which one assumes that the inner jet moves faster then the outer jet zones .",

    "ngc 1275 has been the third radiogalaxy detected in the vhe band ( by magic ) , showing a very soft spectrum smoothly connected to the gev spectrum ( aleksic et al . 2012 ) .",
    "a14 report multifrequency data obtained during two multifrequency campaigns held in 20102011 , thanks to which the overall sed could be assembled .",
    "unfortunately , the available x - ray spectrum , probing the critical region of the sed between the two bumps , is affected by strong pile - up and it was not possible to fix the slope of the underlying non  thermal power law .",
    "the sed is barely compatible with a one - zone leptonic model for the values of the viewing angle usually considered in literature .",
    "the problem with the one  zone model is that , with the small doppler factors corresponding to the large @xmath11 , it is difficult to reproduce the required large separation of the frequencies of the two peaks .",
    "similar to the case of m87 , it is tempting to think that a solution is to admit a structured jet .",
    "in fact , strong observational support to this scenario is provided by the clear evidence for a spine  sheath structure shown in recent vlba maps presented in nagai et al .",
    "the observed limb  brightened structure suggests the presence of a faster central core and a slower sheath for the inner ( i.e. parsec scale ) jet . for an assumed angle of @xmath18 and with the hypothesis of equal rest - frame emissivity , the data are consistent with a bulk lorentz flow of the sheath of 2.4 .",

    "this , coupled with the complexity of the emission from the central regions of ngc 1275 ( which includes several contributions , mainly the thermal emission of the cluster and host galaxy gas ) , makes impossible to determine a unique fit .",
    "a14 report different fits of the x - ray spectrum , corresponding to different fixed values of the spectral index of the power law . considering the goodness of the fit",
    ", the best solution would correspond to a relatively flat spectrum , with photon index 1.7 .",
    "other possible solutions , however , include steeper spectra .",
    "in particular a14 adopt the solution corresponding the a photon index of 2.5 ( dashed gray line in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ 18deg ] ) , which is compatible with the slope of the high  energy tail of the synchrotron component of the one  zone model . although possible , this slope is however rather different than that previously derived for the soft and hard x  ray spectra ( green bow  ties , balmaverde et al .",
    "2006 , ajello et al . 2009 ) , which consistently trace a power law continuum with slope @xmath23 .",
    "however , the flux corresponding to the latter slope ( solid gray line in the left panel ) is exceptionally high , not compatible with the optical datapoint and the lat spectrum . given these large uncertainties we choose to use the historical x - ray data ( green ) for our modeling . with this choice the low ",
    "energy components of the sed has to peak between the radio and the optical band , with the optical associated to the high  energy tail of the component .",
    "this is different from the model discussed in a14 , for which the synchrotron component was instead located in the uv band , with the optical and the ( steep ) x  ray emission associated to the low and high frequency tails of the synchrotron emission .",
    "as discussed a14 , the modeling of the sed within the one - zone ssc scenario is challenging .",
    "a14 performed their analysis in the case of a large synchrotron frequency ( in the soft x - ray band ) ; their arguments are even more compelling in our interpretation , with the sed peak below the optical band .",
    "in fact , as detailed by tg08 for the case of m87 , the main problem is represented by the large separation between the two sed peaks , which unavoidably implies huge doppler factors , incompatible with the large viewing angle inferred for radiogalaxies . adapting the limit obtained in tg08 for the numerical values suitable for ngc 1275 , the sed constrains the doppler factor to be larger than : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the synchrotron and ic luminosities , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the synchrotron and ic peak frequencies and we assume a ( conservative ) variability timescale @xmath29 week .",
    "we therefore exclude the one - zone ssc model and in the following we discuss the structured jet scenario .",
    "we briefly recall the main features and the parameters of the model fully described in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and tg08 .",
    "the spine is assumed to be a cylinder with eighth @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 .",
    "the subscripts  s \" and  l \" stand for spine and layer , respectively .",
    "the layer is a hollow cylinder with height @xmath32 , internal radius @xmath31 and external radius @xmath33 . as for the case of m87",
    ", we assume that @xmath34 , corresponding to the case of a perturbation ( e.g. a shock ) traveling down the the spine , surrounded by a relatively long and stationary layer of slow plasma , possibly resulting from the interaction of the edge of the jet with the external medium .",
    "electrons in both zones follow a broken power law energy distribution , specified by the minimum , the maximum and the break lorentz factors @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and indices @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the model assumes that the electron energy distribution is stationary and it does not take into account the electron radiative losses .",
    "the normalization of the electron distribution is parametrized by the emitted synchrotron luminosity , @xmath40 .",
    "the emitting regions are filled with a tangled magnetic field @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the relativistic beaming is specified by the two lorentz factors @xmath43 , @xmath44 and by the viewing angle @xmath11 .",
    "electrons emit synchrotron and ic radiation . for the latter ,",
    "besides the local synchrotron radiation field ( ssc emission ) we also consider the radiation field of the other component . due to the relative motion ,",
    "the energy density of the radiation field of one component in the rest frame of the other is boosted by the squared of the relative lorentz factor , @xmath45 . in the calculations we also take into account the absorption of @xmath0rays through the interaction with the soft radiation field , @xmath5 .",
    "since the radiation is produced and absorbed within the same region , the  suppression factor \" due to absorption is @xmath46\\}/\\tau_{\\gamma \\gamma}(\\nu)$ ] which , for large optical depths , simply becomes @xmath47 .    for a fixed viewing angle @xmath11 , the ( bolometric ) synchrotron and ssc luminosities of both components",
    "are amplified by the usual boosting factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the ic emission from the scattering of the radiation field produced in the other component follows a more complex pattern , involving the relative doppler factors between the two components ( see tg08 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "although the number of the parameters is large ( almost twice that of the simple ssc model ) , the model has to satisfy other constraints that can be used as guidelines in selecting the suitable setup .      the first point that we consider is the possibility that the two peaks of the sed are produced by a single emitting region ( hence by the same electron population ) but with target photons for the ic scattering being provided by an external region ( without this last condition we would fall in the ssc model previously excluded ) . in the structured jet scenario the emission region could be the layer and the external radiation is that produced by the spine , or _",
    "viceversa_. indeed this was the original set - up discussed in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , in which the entire sed of radio  galaxies was attributed to the layer .",
    "this possibility is disfavored for the case of ngc 1275 ( as for the previous case of m87 in tg08 ) because it requires a doppler factor not compatible with the inferred relatively large viewing angle @xmath50 .",
    "briefly , the reasoning leading to this conclusion develops through the following three steps : i ) the frequency of the ic peak , @xmath28 , provides a lower limit for the lorentz factor of the electrons emitting at the peaks of the sed , @xmath51 ; ii ) this limit , coupled to the observed synchrotron peak frequency @xmath27 , provides an upper limit for the ratio of the magnetic field and the doppler factor @xmath52 ; iii ) the observed high energy flux limits the level of the ssc component : the magnetic field can not be smaller than a critical value .",
    "this , coupled with the @xmath52 upper limit derived above , constrains @xmath53 to be larger than a critical value , that can be achieved only for small angles , no matter the value of @xmath9 .",
    "more quantitatively the steps are the following :    * if the ic peak is produced in the kn regime , the energy of the electrons at the peak are comparable to the photons energies , i.e. @xmath54 . if , on the other hand , the peak is produced in the thomson regime , the peak frequency would be @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the peak frequency of the external radiation field in the comoving frame of the emitting source ) with the thomson condition @xmath57 , which provides @xmath58 . inserting the numerical values , the lorentz factor of the electrons emitting at the peak",
    "would therefore be @xmath59 . *",
    "the observed synchrotron peak frequency @xmath60 hz with the limit derived above for @xmath61 implies @xmath62 g. * with the value of @xmath61 and @xmath27 , the ssc component is predicted to peak at a frequency @xmath63 hz .",
    "its luminosity therefore is limited by the observed hard x - ray flux .",
    "looking at the sed we can write this condition as : @xmath64 using the limit on @xmath65 derived above and expressing the radius as @xmath66 we find : @xmath67 in which we have assumed the ( conservative ) value @xmath29 week .",
    "note that the case @xmath68  corresponding to scattering in the thomson ",
    "kn transition  is the most conservative one in terms doppler factor .",
    "in fact , larger values of @xmath61 imply smaller magnetic fields and thus larger doppler factors to keep the ssc luminosity below the limit .",
    "we remark that the above inference only assumes that the seed photons for scattering are not synchrotron .",
    "therefore the conclusion is valid not only for a structured jet , but also when the external radiation originates in the environment surrounding the jet ( e.g. from accretion or dust ) .    the derived lower limit for the doppler factor ,",
    "although not extreme , requires @xmath69 , smaller than the value @xmath70 estimated by radio observations ( see a14 ) .",
    "moreover the situation is even more complex due to the fact that for @xmath71 and lorentz factors @xmath72 , @xmath734 , the doppler factors of both components are very similar , making unlikely that a single component dominates the entire sed . for smaller still angles ,",
    "the emission from the spine starts to dominate the sed . in fig .",
    "[ 18deg ] ( top panel ) we report our fit for @xmath3 , implying that ngc 1275 is a blazar .",
    "the dashed red and the thin solid blue line show the contribution of the spine and the layer to the total emission , clearly dominated by the spine . the high - energy bump is a mix of ssc ( in the x  ray band ) and ic off the photons of the layer ( the peak in the @xmath0ray band ) .",
    "the corresponding parameters are reported in the first raw of tab . 1 .",
    "although the model reproduces quite satisfactorily the sed , the implied angle is clearly not consistent with the values derived from radio observations .",
    "given this difficulty , the possibility of a single emitting region seems rather unlikely . in the next section",
    "we therefore consider the case with a large @xmath11 and with both regions contributing to the emission .    [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab1 ]      after the discussion in the previous section we are left with two alternative possibilities : either the spine produces the observed synchrotron component and the layer the high  energy component or , conversely , the spine produces the @xmath0ray emission and the layer the low frequency peak .    in the latter case",
    ", the spine would produce a sed strongly unbalanced toward the ic peak , since the synchrotron luminosity must be low enough not to contribute to the observed emission , @xmath74 . in this case",
    ", the corresponding emission from the spine as seen by an observer aligned with the jet would be even more extreme , since the ratio between the ic ( by construction mainly produced by the scattering of the photons from the layer ) and the synchrotron luminosities increases for smaller angles ( dermer 1995 , tg08 ) .",
    "the resulting source would appear as a strongly ic dominated bl lac object , for which there are no representatives in current samples of blazars .",
    "the most plausible solution is thus to associate the low  energy component with the synchrotron emission of the spine and the high  energy bump to the ic emission of the layer .",
    "this is the solution we discuss in the following .    in fig .",
    "[ 18deg ] ( second and third panels ) we report the results of our model for two different viewing angles , @xmath75 and @xmath18 .",
    "as discussed above , we suppose that the spine ( red line ) is responsible for the low energy bump , while the high - energy component is the result of the layer ic component ( blue ) . to produce @xmath0rays , the electrons of the layer have quite large lorentz factors , @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding synchrotron frequency falls in the x  ray band . to not overproduce the flux in this band we keep a low value of the layer magnetic field",
    "clearly , the emission from the layer is strongly unbalanced in favor of the ic emission , dominated by the scattering off the ir photons of the spine . when setting the parameters of the spine we are guided by the requirements to produce a sed dominated by the synchrotron component .",
    "however , we also require that the ic component is not too low .",
    "this requirement follows from the fact that , once observed at smaller angles , one expects to observe a sed similar to that of typical low synchrotron peaked bl lac objects ( see below ) . in this case",
    "it is likely that the ic component , peaking in the soft @xmath0ray band , substantially contributes to the observed x ",
    "ray continuum .",
    "note that , due to the low luminosity and the relatively high frequency of the synchrotron peak of the layer , the resulting contribution of this radiation field to the ic emission from the spine is negligible ( thus the ic peak is dominated by the ssc component ) . in analogy with the case of m87 , we adopt bulk lorentz factors @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the relative lorentz factor is @xmath79 .",
    "the value of the spine is typically derived for bl lac objects ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) , sources for which the spine should dominate the entire sed . in the case of the layer , we adopt a value similar to that used for m87 . having fixed these parameters we try to find the set of the remaining parameters that better reproduce the data .    for @xmath80 the model can satisfactorily reproduce the observed high  energy bump . for @xmath4",
    ", however , the model fails in reproducing the data at the highest energies .",
    "the reason for this problem , already discussed in tg08 for the case of m87 but more severe here , is the huge photon ",
    "photon absorption of the high - energy @xmath0rays produced in the layer by the dense ir  optical radiation field of the spine .",
    "while for the case @xmath75 the intrinsic ( i.e. beaming corrected ) synchrotron luminosity of the spine is still low enough to make the source transparent for photons at few hundreds of gev , for @xmath81 the optical depth exceeds unity above few tens of gev , causing an abrupt cut  off of the emission . the optical depth can be approximated by ( e.g. dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the jet radius and @xmath84 is the soft photons number density in the layer frame , calculated at the threshold energy @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is used to transform the observed synchrotron luminosity to the spine rest frame and @xmath88 is the boosting term of the photon energy density from the spine to the layer frame . for a fixed observed luminosity of the target photons , the optical depth depends strongly on the doppler factor , as @xmath89 . in fig .",
    "[ tau ] , we show the optical depth and the corresponding  suppression factor \" @xmath90/\\tau_{\\gamma \\gamma}$ ] as a function of the frequency , in the two cases .",
    "the shape of the curves , which reflects the spectrum of the target photons , is similar in both cases , but the case @xmath81 implies an optical depth larger by a factor of @xmath91 , as expected from the ratio of the two boosting factors in the two cases , @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath75 the source is transparent ( @xmath93 ) up to @xmath94 gev . instead , for @xmath81 , the optical depth reaches unity already at 2030 gev and rapidly increases , determining the abrupt cut  off visible in fig .",
    "[ 18deg ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "an effect possibly mitigating the importance of the opacity , not treated in our calculations , is related to the anisotropy of the soft photon target field .",
    "in fact , in the frame of the layer , the @xmath0ray photons eventually reaching us make an angle of @xmath9590@xmath96 with the jet axis , while the target photons , produced by the spine , are going along the jet axis .",
    "the @xmath0rays and their targets therefore preferentially collide with an angle of @xmath97 .",
    "since the threshold condition for the reaction depends on the angle , @xmath98 , this translates into a shift to higher @xmath99 by a factor @xmath100 of the curves in fig .",
    "this , coupled to the presence of another factor @xmath101 in the expression of the optical depth , implies an effective decrease of @xmath102 at a given frequency .",
    "however , while the effect could be important for frequencies for which @xmath103 ( i.e. around @xmath104 hz for the case @xmath11=25@xmath2 ) , its impact on the suppression factor at larger frequencies , for which the optical depth rapidly reaches @xmath105 , is almost negligible .",
    "focusing on the case for @xmath75 , the power carried by the jet ( assuming a composition of one cold proton per emitting electron , e.g. celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) is @xmath106 erg s@xmath20 and @xmath107 erg s@xmath20 for the layer and the spine , respectively .",
    "the corresponding radiative luminosities ( corrected for beaming ) are @xmath108 erg s@xmath20 and @xmath109 erg s@xmath20 .",
    "the coupling with the spine radiation field makes the layer extremely efficient to convert kinetic power into radiation , with an efficiency @xmath110 .",
    "the spine power appears quite large , more similar to the average power inferred for the powerful flat spectrum radio quasar than those of bl lac objects ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "the mass of the black hole in ngc 1275 is estimated to be around @xmath111 ( woo & urry 2002 ) , corresponding to an eddington luminosity of @xmath112 erg s@xmath20 .",
    "the jet power is thus about a factor of 5 larger , consistent with what generally inferred by studies of the jet of blazars ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "[ 1420 ] shows the sed calculated for the case @xmath80 as would be recorded by an observer located at @xmath3 from the jet axis ( solid black line ) .",
    "this sed would thus correspond to that of the blazar associated to the misaligned jet of ngc 1275 ( numerical values of the flux correspond to the blazar located at the same redshift as ngc 1275 ) .",
    "the synchrotron peak located in the optical band would lead to classify the source as a bl lac object with the peak in the ir band .",
    "the overall shape of the sed observed at @xmath113 resembles ( apart from the @xmath0ray emission ) the shape of the bl lac object 1420 + 5422 ( @xmath114 , shaw et al .",

    "in fact the data of 1420 + 5422 ( green data points , from http://tools.asdc.asi.it ) have been increased by a factor 15 .",
    "finally we discuss the possible role of an environmental radiation field .",
    "in fact , any soft ambient radiation field , beamed in the layer frame , could contribute to the ic emission .",
    "unfortunately the knowledge of the nuclear environment of ngc 1275 is far from complete . as for the other fri radio galaxies",
    ", the lack of broad emission lines leads to the idea that any accretion flow should be quite inefficient .",
    "we can derive a robust upper limit on the luminosity of the nuclear component from the measured ir flux of the core ( green star in fig .",

    "the contribution of the external radiation is maximized if its emission occurs within a region with size of the order of the distance of the emission region in the jet , @xmath116 .",

    "a simple estimate of the optical depth at this energy yields @xmath125 ( assuming a distance @xmath126 cm ) .",
    "this upper limit to the optical depth due to the environment is then smaller than the internal absorption .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that the overall sed of ngc 1275 can be satisfactorily reproduced in the framework of the  spine - layer \" model  with bulk lorentz factors for the two components similar to those used in the case of m87  if the viewing angle is smaller then @xmath127 deg .",
    "larger angles inevitably lead to a drastic suppression of the emission in the magic energy band caused by the strong internal absorption of the @xmath0rays with energies above few tens of gev , determined by the luminous ir radiation field associated to the spine emission .",
    "estimates of the angle at pc scale , based on the detection of the counter jet , provide values in the range 3055 degrees ( walker et al . 1994 , asada et al . 2006 ) .",

    "the model would be the detection of photons at energies above 1 tev , for which , even with @xmath75 , the optical depth @xmath129 , corresponding to a suppression of the flux exceeding @xmath130 .    a point not completely satisfactory about our preferred model for @xmath75 concerns the emission the jet would present if observed at smaller angles . as previously discussed in tg08 , in the unification scheme for radio  galaxies and blazars we generally expect that , once observed at small angles , the non  thermal continuum from a radiogalaxy resembles that of a blazar .",
    "in particular , for ngc 1275 we expect that the sed shape follows that of high  power bl lac objects .",
    "we indeed found a source whose sed shape closely traces our theoretical curve , but with a luminosity about one order of magnitude smaller than the beamed emission of ngc 1275 .",
    "a14 report the existence of a clear correlation between the lat @xmath0ray flux , @xmath131 , and the optical flux , @xmath132 , compatible with both a linear ( @xmath133 ) and a quadratic ( @xmath134 ) dependence . in our scheme",
    "the flux in the two bands is dominated by the emission produced in two separate regions , i.e. the spine for the optical and the layer for the @xmath0rays . in principle",
    "several possibilities are allowed by this configuration .",
    "for instance , @xmath0ray variability without counterpart in the optical is possible with changes of the parameters of the layer ( in particular those specifying the electron energy distribution ) and a stationary spine emission . on the other hand , since the ic emission of the layer",
    " responsible for the observed high  energy emission  is dominated by the scattering of the synchrotron photons of the spine , we expect that variations of the optical emission are accompanied by variations in the @xmath0ray band .",
    "if such variations are driven by changes in the intrinsic emissivity of the spine , without changes in the structural parameters ( in particular the bulk lorentz factor ) we expect a linear correlation",
    ". however , if variations of @xmath135 ( and/or of @xmath136 ) are also involved , more complex patterns are possible , connected to the interplay between the beaming of the emission in the observer frame and the amplification of the energy density of the seed photons , depending on the relative motion of the spine and the layer . with such a complex phenomenology is difficult to clearly identify a mechanism for the observed correlation .",
    "the simplest situation , corresponding to a linear correlation , is associated to variations of the electron energy distribution or of the magnetic field of the spine .",
    "we thank the referee for the insightful and constructive comments that helped us to greatly improve the paper .",
