    "in the realm of statistical physics , as well as in quantum field theory , the need for non - perturbative approaches to study the vicinity of a phase transition has long been appreciated .",
    "results of recent simulations show that the form of the effective potential for a variety of systems can be determined using monte carlo methods .",
    "such methods have also been applied to the study of the electroweak phase transition via lattice monte carlo methods  @xcite .",
    "additional continuum limit work has recently been performed on a @xmath1 theory in three - dimensions  @xcite .",
    "extracting the effective potential provides one with an additional window onto the equilibrium  and possibly the dynamical  behavior of a system near and at its critical point .",
    "one use of monte carlo methods is to test scaling forms based on the renormalization group .",
    "a second is to explore the equilibrium behavior associated with such phenomena as two - phase coexistence and broken continuous symmetry .",
    "binder  @xcite and more recently tsypin   and chen and dohm  @xcite have utilized monte carlo and binning techniques to generate probability distributions of the order parameter of an @xmath2 ( ising - like ) system in the vicinity of its critical point . in tsypin s work data were generated at a single temperature , and over a range of symmetry - breaking fields in order to explore the full scaling domain . above the critical temperature",
    "the distribution was found to be consistent with a low - order polynomial form for the effective potential , which , as discussed below , is essentially the logarithm of the probability distribution .",
    "the results of simulations were most closely fit when the effective potential was terminated at the sixth order . the standard quartic ginzburg - landau form for the effective potential failed to produce an adequate fit for any choice of coefficients , and the addition of eighth and higher order terms did not materially improve the agreement between the fitting form and the results of simulations .",
    "this remarkable set of results persists below the critical temperature  . here",
    ", it was found that a sixth - order polynomial form for the effective potential leads to an outstanding match to the results of simulations . in this case",
    "the best - fit effective potential was found to contain a _ negative _ quartic term .",
    "an additional feature of tsypin s fitting form is a prefactor , proportional to the square root of the second derivative of the effective potential .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether or not the data are consistent with a scaling form for the effective potential . in fact , the nature of the polynomial strongly suggests a form incorporating thermodynamic scaling with exponents appropriate to the ising model .",
    "the rationale for this will be explored in more depth in subsequent sections .",
    "it should be noted that the renormalization group has been utilized previously to generate order parameter distributions in the vicinity of the critical point@xcite .",
    "the principal novelty in this paper is the attempt to produce a unified form for the order parameter distribution that fits data above , below and at the critical point .",
    "it is found that the inclusion of the prefactor mentioned above leads for excellent agreement with data based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "the prefactor does not play an important role in the fitting of a scaling form to the order parameter distribution in the high and low temperature phases .",
    "however , this finite size correction is essential to the construction of a high - precision fit to data at the critical point .",
    "checks on the quality of the fit include comparisons of a universal ratio of moments of the distribution with values in the literature determined by a variety of alternative techniques , and comparison between our optimum fit value of the fourth order coupling @xmath3 with a variety of other determinations of that quantity .",
    "these checks are very encouraging .",
    "it appears that a scaling form based on renormalized mean field theory agrees to a high degree of accuracy with published results . on this basis",
    ", one has confidence that an equation of state constructed in a similar manner from renormalized mean field theory will accurately describe systems in the @xmath2 , or ising model , universality class .",
    "the remainder of this paper is laid out as follows . in the next section the effective potential",
    "is defined and a phenomenological scaling description is presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] a renormalization group derivation of the scaling form is given , and in the following section the `` prefactor '' is discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite ] finite size effects are addressed , while sec .",
    "[ sec : compare ] assesses the success of the scaling form of the effective potential as a fit to tsypin s monte carlo simulations .",
    "[ sec : conc ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "an appendix contains a discussion of the effect of the prefactor on an important universal quantity .",
    "we imagine a scalar ( ising - like ) system described by order parameter , @xmath4 and ordering field , @xmath5 , in equilibrium at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "if the system is described by hamiltonian @xmath7 the constrained ( reduced ) free energy , @xmath8 , is given by @xmath9 = \\int d\\phi\\   \\delta\\left(m - i(\\phi)\\right)\\exp\\left[-h(\\phi)/t\\right]\\ : , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the average order in configuration @xmath11 , @xmath12 represents the volume of the system , and @xmath13 is the dimensionality .",
    "the effective potential @xmath14 , is usually defined as @xmath15 which identifies it with the constrained free energy . according to standard scaling notions ,",
    "when the linear extent , @xmath16 , of the system is sufficiently great , the effective potential , @xmath14 , of an @xmath2 system will have the form @xmath17 the parameter @xmath18 is the reduced temperature , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the critical temperature , and the ordering , or symmetry - breaking , field @xmath5 has been introduced above .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is a characteristic linear extent of the system , and @xmath13 is its spatial dimensionality . the exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 appear in the ( unconstrained ) two - point correlation function @xmath23 , @xmath24 all thermodynamic exponents follow from the two correlation function exponents , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , given the standard scaling and hyperscaling relations@xcite .",
    "when the spatial dimensionality is @xmath25 , the critical exponents are  @xcite @xmath26    an immediate consequence of expression ( [ effp ] ) is that the effective potential at the critical point ( @xmath27 ) has the form @xmath28 it is reasonable to expect that , within the scaling regime , at low enough reduced temperature and ordering field , and for appropriate values of the order parameter ( that is , if the order parameter controls the decay of correlations ) the effective potential will behave in the same way .",
    "if one attempts to approximate the effective potential by a polynomial in the order parameter , @xmath29 , the `` best '' one will , most likely , not have terms that go beyond sixth order .",
    "interestingly , this is precisely the result of tsypin s unbiased attempt to fit his simulation data to a polynomial effective potential : a _ fourth order _ , ginzburg - landau form _ fails _ to adequately represent the data , while the coefficients of terms _ beyond sixth order _ are so small as to cast doubt on their appearance in the true effective potential .",
    "this result holds both above and below the critical temperature  that is , whether the system is in the disordered or the ordered state .",
    "now , the form ( [ effp ] ) is expected to apply only when the order parameter @xmath29 lies at  or close to  the value which minimizes the free energy at fixed @xmath30 . in particular ,",
    "there are known difficulties in applying the above scaling form ( [ effp ] ) to the case of a system in the coexistence region , which impinge directly on the scaling regime .",
    "the equilibrium state within the coexistence regime will generally involve one or more interfacial regions separating two homogeneous thermodynamic phases .",
    "because of this , the scaling form , which is hypothesized for a _ single _ homogeneous phase , does not necessarily do an adequate job of describing the behavior of a system in which two different phases coexist . on the other hand ,",
    "a scaling form ought to predict with great accuracy the dependence of thermodynamic functions on temperature and ordering field as these fields approach the coexistence line , that is , at the phase boundary for two - phase coexistence .",
    "there is one more consequence of scaling that is worthy of note . the scaling form in eq . ( [ effp ] )",
    "together with correlation function scaling implies the following form for the free energy@xcite @xmath31 in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ ghat ] ) the quantity @xmath32 is the _ bulk _ correlation length at @xmath33 .",
    "the general form in eq .",
    "( [ effp ] ) restricts , but does not specify , the detailed dependence of the effective potential @xmath14 on @xmath18 and @xmath5 .",
    "other considerations are required for an explicit evaluation .",
    "one candidate form is based on the renormalization group , particularly the field - theoretical expansion in @xmath34 , where , as above , @xmath13 is the spatial dimensionality of the system .",

    "_ renormalized _ ginzburg - landau free energy , and is hence equivalent to `` renormalized mean - field theory '' .",
    "the renormalization , indeed the full effect of the renormalization group trajectories , resides in the quantity @xmath38 which is equivalent to the `` block spin '' size .",
    "this key quantity may be determined via @xmath39 the effective potential described by eqs .",
    "( [ greffp ] ) and ( [ l * ] ) is fully consistent with the scaling hypotheses embodied in eq .",
    "( [ effp ] ) .",
    "it is is completely determined once the coupling constant @xmath3 has been set , along with `` metrical '' factors associated with the scales of @xmath5 and @xmath18 .",
    "the inclusion of higher order , loop expansion contributions leads to modifications of the effective potential , so , on the face of it , there is no reason to expect that ( [ greffp ] ) will be exact",
    ". however , given that it is entirely consistent with critical point scaling , that it embodies the full rg trajectories , and that it represents the leading order contribution in a systematic renormalization group expansion for the free energy , it seems at least a plausible `` zeroth order '' candidate for the critical effective potential .",
    "this optimism is bolstered by other situations in which `` renormalized mean - field theory '' provides surprisingly good numerical results when applied in three dimensions .",
    "in this section we discuss the prefactor introduced by binder  @xcite and used by tsypin in fitting ising simulations  .",
    "a variety of arguments have been advanced for the existence of this term . here",
    "we introduce additional justification for the prefactor .",
    "suppose we allow spatial variations of the order parameter around the globally constrained value @xmath29 in the form @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41 . neglecting terms of greater than quadratic order in the @xmath42 s , the dependence of the effective hamiltonian on the @xmath43 s at gaussian order will be @xmath44}{t } = \\sum_{\\vec{k } \\neq 0 } \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\vec{\\nabla }",
    "\\sigma(\\vec{k})\\right|^2 + \\frac{1}{2}{\\cal h}^{\\prime \\prime}\\sigma(\\vec{k } ) \\sigma(-\\vec{k } ) \\right ] . \\label{gauss}\\ ] ] the term @xmath45 is the second derivative with respect to the order parameter @xmath29 of the effective potential @xmath14 at renormalized mean field level discussed above .",
    "as noted the sum excludes the @xmath46 mode of the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "integration over the @xmath43 s yields the following `` gaussian '' correction to the effective potential @xmath47 as above @xmath12 is the spatial volume of the system .",
    "the last term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gauss1 ] ) is the leading order difference between the sum on the left hand side and its asymptotic limit as the integral on the right .",
    "this term can be thought of as a finite size correction to the extensive result in the limit , @xmath48 .",
    "a general feature of the prefactor that will prove to be of some use shortly is its connection with the renormalized mean - field susceptibility , @xmath49 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to the order parameter is inversely related to the susceptibility , i.e. , @xmath50    when the effective potential displays the effects of critical fluctuations , the derivation above acquires modifications , specifically the inclusion of counter - terms in a full renormalization group treatment .",
    "most of the steps leading to this finite size correction are as displayed above .",
    "the final result preserves the relationship between the prefactor and the isothermal susceptibility implied by the above equation .",
    "specifically , the new prefactor has the form @xmath51 at the level of renormalized mean - field theory , one can write for the susceptibility @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the critical exponent for the isothermal susceptibility ( @xmath54 ) . as noted previously , the quantity @xmath55 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ l * ] ) .",
    "there is a more general argument for the existence of the prefactor .",
    "this argument is based on the `` infinitesimal '' momentum shell version of the renormalization group used in the calculation of the partition function of the ginzburg - landau - wilson model@xcite . in this approach , modes at the surface of a shrinking brillouin zone are integrated out .",
    "the contributions to the free energy have a gaussian - like form .",
    "the key contribution to the net free energy is @xmath56 \\label{freeenergy2}\\ ] ] in expression ( [ freeenergy2 ] ) , the self energy term @xmath57 contains the effects of fluctuations whose wave vectors exceed @xmath58 in magnitude .",
    "if the uniform mode is singled out , the sum in ( [ freeenergy2 ] ) is carried out over all non - zero @xmath58 s .",
    "the one term that does not contribute to the free energy is , thus , equal to @xmath59 \\label{missingterm}\\ ] ] in this term the restriction on the momenta of the fluctuations contributing to @xmath60 no longer differentiates the quantity from the standard self energy , @xmath61 .",
    "standard arguments suffice to establish the connection between the the susceptibility and the self energy . if the @xmath62 term is added to the sum in eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy2 ] ) , we end up with a sum over @xmath58 that constitutes the leading order bulk contribution to the effective potential .",
    "it is then necessary to perform a subtraction leading to a term in the exponent of the form @xmath63 = \\ln \\sqrt{\\chi_{t}}$ ] .",
    "that the `` subtracted '' term appears in the exponent with a positive sign reflects the fact that the partition function is the exponential of minus the free energy .",
    "there are other finite size effects . for example",
    ", there is a limit on the maximum possible size of a block spin in the renormalization procedure .",
    "this limit appears as a modification of eq .",
    "( [ l * ] ) . a limit on the block spin size , and hence the quantity @xmath64 , is enforced if eq .",
    "( [ l * ] ) is modified so as to ensure that the size of the block spin does not exceed the dimensions of the system .",
    "the new requirement on @xmath64 is @xmath65 the quantity @xmath66 is a number of order unity . in principle , the results of a calculation will not depend on the specific value of @xmath66 , as the value of @xmath64 is a detail of the renormalization group procedure , which has no effect on the final result@xcite . in practice , the results that follow from the use of eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) depend sensitively on the choice of the parameter @xmath66 . in the work reported here , this quantity thus acquires the status of a fitting _ metrical _ parameter connecting the lattice size in the ising simulations to the length parameter @xmath16 in the renormalization group approach .",
    "the effective potential ( [ greffp ] ) is now compared to the results of the ising model simulations performed by tsypin .",
    "four data sets from tsypin s simulations are fit , one in the ordered phase ( @xmath67 ) , one in the disordered ( @xmath68 ) and two at the critical temperature @xmath69 ; ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the data in the disordered phase are gathered in a monte carlo investigation of the order parameter distribution of a system of @xmath71 ising spins . in the case of the ordered phase , the simulations were performed on a system of @xmath72 spins , while lattices of @xmath73 and @xmath74 were used for the simulations at criticality .",
    "the data are fit with the renormalized mean - field approximation eq .",
    "( [ greffp ] ) including the prefactor .",
    "the fitting procedure includes the use of the restriction on @xmath64 obtained by solving the transcendental equation , ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "the overall normalization is set such that the area under our curve matches that of tsypin s histograms .",
    "our fitting procedure utilizes a grid - search minimization of the @xmath75 merit function .",
    "@xmath76 the parameters @xmath77 for the zeroth - order fit are @xmath18 , @xmath3 and @xmath66 that appear in ( [ greffp ] ) and ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "technically , this expression is the _ reduced _ @xmath78 since we divide by the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath79 is the number of data bins less the number of free parameters .",
    "the errors @xmath80 were assumed to be of gaussian order ; i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "this assumption is conservative since the @xmath78 is less than the expected result , which should be approximately unity .    as an initial effort to minimize @xmath78 , a _",
    "blind fit _ is performed across all the histograms of a given data set ( e.g. , in the disordered phase the seven histograms corresponding to the seven different values of the external field @xmath5 ) .",
    "see table [ table1 ] . in this blind",
    "fit each bin of each histogram is treated with the same weight .",
    "this procedure certainly leads to an unbiased minimization of @xmath78 , but further fine - tuning is required as explained below .",
    "it is important to note the similarity between the values of @xmath3 in both temperature regimes . in zeroth - order approximation",
    "we find @xmath82 for the disordered and ordered phases , respectively .",
    "this is quite significant in that landau - ginzburg theory dictates that the fourth - order coupling be the same everywhere .",
    "also note that the value of @xmath18 that best fits the data from the critical simulations is indeed zero , as expected .",
    "we do observe one anomaly in the best fit values of the reduced temperature in the ordered and disordered phases , however .",
    "namely , if we compare the ratio of the temperatures we obtain @xmath83 while from tsypin s simulation we have @xmath84 this is unfortunate as we expect this ratio to be the same in the simulations and our fit even though the temperatures themselves need not be .",
    "an additional comment needs to be made for the fitting of the ordered phase data .",
    "notice that in the @xmath5 = 0 histogram we have removed the data lying to the left of the peak .",
    "attempts to fit the data in that regime did not produce satisfactory results .",
    "we attribute this failure to the fact that a single renormalized ginzburg - landau form ( such as eq .",
    "( [ greffp ] ) ) is inappropriate to the region of two - phase coexistence .",
    "one expects that the scaling form for the free energy ( combined with the prefactor ) should provide a reasonable approximation to the free energy in _ all _ temperature regimes using a single value of @xmath3 and @xmath66 . to this end , we search for a set of parameters that minimize the @xmath85 for all data sets .",
    "the most effective strategy for accomplishing this task is to first determine a range of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath66 that fit the @xmath86 data .",
    "these bounds are then used for a three parameter fit in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 phases which yields final values of @xmath18 , @xmath3 and @xmath66 .",
    "it should be noted that a significant amount of `` tweaking '' of the parameters is necessary in addition to the blind minimization of the @xmath85 .",
    "these values are tabulated in [ table2 ] and the resulting probability densities are plotted against tsypin s data in the three temperature regimes .",
    "the plots are displayed in figures 1 - 3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ratio of temperatures discussed above is now @xmath89 which is within one percent of tsypin s value .    to further evaluate our scaling form",
    "we also calculate the universal quantity @xmath90 the values of @xmath91 from our calculations compared to other sources are tabulated in [ table3 ] .    as a final check on our results ,",
    "we compare our best fit value of the renormalized coupling constant @xmath3 with results obtained by other methods .",
    "a variety of techniques have been utilized to determine this universal quantity , including the @xmath36 expansion , high order loop expansions in three dimensions , monte carlo simulations and high temperature series@xcite .",
    "recently reported values of the renormalized fourth order coupling constant range from 0.233 to 0.236 .",
    "this is to be compared with our optimum global fit @xmath92 ; see table [ table2 ] .",
    "given that no attempt twas made to match previously determined values of the renormalized fourth order coupling in our fitting procedure , the quality of agreement can be described as , at the very least , encouraging .",
    ".the values of fitted parameters @xmath18 , @xmath3 and @xmath66 obtained from the blind fits for four different data sets .",
    "the stated errors are 68%  confidence limits ; i.e. one standard deviation . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that a low order scaling form provides an excellent fit to the order parameter distribution both quite near the three - dimensional ising model critical point and exactly at criticality .",
    "our approximant , while at the lowest nontrivial order in the interdimensional @xmath36 expansion , nonetheless includes full renormalization group flows for the relevant variables and thus has critical point ( hyper-)scaling built in .",
    "the scaling result that at criticality latexmath:[${\\cal h } \\sim    close agreement with tsypin s   polynomial fit . that this ought to be so follows from straightforward scaling arguments .",
    "the fitting parameters used were the nonuniversal metrical factors for the reduced temperature , @xmath18 , the fourth order coupling constant @xmath3 and the parameter @xmath66 , which controls the effects of finite size on the determination of the quantity @xmath64 through the relationship eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "this is certainly fewer than allowed ; the @xmath0 model and the ising model are presumably in the same universality class , but are not identical .",
    "we also took the coupling @xmath3 to be constant .",
    "however , there is no reason to believe that the ising model at criticality is at its fixed point for coupling constants .",
    "hence , corrections to scaling should certainly be allowed , which in practice would mean the renormalization group flow for the fourth - order coupling @xmath94 could be included .",
    "we have chosen not to do so in order to minimize the number of free parameters .",
    "the prefactor used by binder  @xcite and tsypin   is discussed in section  [ sec : prefactor ] within the setting of a renormalization group calculation .",
    "while this prefactor has only limited effect on the quality of fits in the high and low temperature phases , it plays a crucial role at the critical point .",
    "this issue is discussed in more depth in the appendix , where the influence of the prefactor on the universal ratio @xmath95 is also explored .",
    "the fact that a low - order - in-@xmath36 expression for the renormalized free energy of the ising system reproduces simulation data to such a high degree of accuracy has encouraging implications with respect to the derivation of an equation of state applicable to an @xmath2 system in the immediate vicinity of a critical point .",
    "in addition , there is every reason to be hopeful that low order corrections to the zero loop expression utilized in this work will allow for an even higher precision fit to data .",
