    "for more than two decades , the optical process of parametric down - conversion ( pdc)@xcite has been the primary photon source in quantum optics experiments@xcite .",
    "this nonlinear process converts single photons into pairs of signal and idler photons , which possess quantum correlations between their various degrees of freedom .",
    "the statistical nature of this process is a subject of great interest , as the photon - number statistics of the process provide a direct indication of its non - classility@xcite .",
    "additionally , the photon statistics have practical implications on state preparation schemes , where the quality of the produced state depends on the number of photons generated simultaneously within the pdc process@xcite .",
    "recent developments in photon - number resolving detectors@xcite enable the implementation of a wide range of applications in quantum optics , including state preparation schemes@xcite , quantum state filtering@xcite and quantum gates@xcite .",
    "number discriminating capabilities have also been shown to aid in probing eavesdropping attacks on quantum cryptography protocols@xcite .",
    "furthermore , one of the most prominent advantages of number - resolving detectors is the ability to directly measure the photon - number statistics of an optical state .",
    "the photon - number distribution of a pdc source can range between a thermal distribution , when a single down - converted mode is collected , and a poisson distribution when an infinitely large number of spatial and spectral modes ( multimode ) is collected@xcite .",
    "the photon statistics of pdc sources has been directly measured in several works@xcite , all of which report a poisson distribution .",
    "however , the majority of quantum optics schemes take great care to ascertain that only a single mode is collected . using an indirect homodyne detection method ,",
    "a thermal distribution from a parametric amplifier was demonstrated@xcite .",
    "transition between thermal to poisson distributions was indirectly observed through the @xmath0 parameter@xcite and through high - order pdc events@xcite . in this work",
    ", we use a photon - number resolving detector in order to directly measure the photon statistics of the signal and idler photons collected from a controlled number of modes , allowing us to observe the range of distributions between the single - mode and the multimode extremes .",
    "the photon - number resolving detector used in this work is the silicon photomultiplier ( sipm )  @xcite .",
    "the sipm detector is composed of multiple avalanche - photo - diodes ( apd ) operating in geiger - mode , combined on a single substrate .",
    "when a photon impinges on an apd element , an electric discharge can be generated .",
    "the photons impinging on the detector are distributed across its many elements .",
    "the output signals generated by all apds are combined to form a single output pulse whose intensity is proportional to the number of triggered elements . in comparison to other technologies ,",
    "the sipm detector offers a better photon - number resolution ( up to 20 photons , compared to 10 or less ) , easy integration in optical setups and operation at room temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "its photon detection efficiency is 26 times lower , depending on the working wavelength .",
    "the photon statistics measured by sipm detectors may deviate from that of the original state .",
    "the three main reasons for these deviations are : 1 )  the non - perfect overall photon detection efficiency ( loss ) , which is determined by the detection and coupling efficiencies , 2 )  false detections caused by thermal excitations ( dark counts ) , and 3 )  optical crosstalk , in which secondary photons , created by carrier relaxation in one apd element , are detected by a neighboring element , falsely increasing the photon count@xcite .",
    "another deviation is caused by events when two or more photons impinge on the same element and are detected as one .",
    "however , we have shown using a numerical model that this effect becomes significant only when the number of detected photons is higher than 20% of the total number of elements@xcite .",
    "the descriptions of loss and dark counts are quite straightforward .",
    "however , several currently available models for the crosstalk effect are either computationally difficult@xcite or only applicable under limiting conditions@xcite .",
    "we introduce here an analytical crosstalk model which can be applied for the entire range of experimental settings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : data - analysis ] we present a model for the distortion effects in the sipm detector , that includes a new approach to the crosstalk effect .",
    "this model is used for the interpretation of experimental data and the reconstruction of the original photon - number statistics .",
    "[ sec : experimental ] describes the experimental setup for the generation of pdc states and their detection using an sipm photon - number resolving detector . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results-&-discussion ] we present measurements of photon - number distributions of parametric down - conversion and their dependence on the number of collected modes .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to interpret the photon - number statistics measured using sipm detectors , the effects of loss , dark counts , and optical crosstalk must be properly modeled . if the measured photon - number distribution is represented by a vector of probabilities @xmath1 , the original probability distribution @xmath2 , is related to the measured distribution through the relation @xmath3 each component of the distortion matrix @xmath4",
    "is the conditional probability @xmath5 of measuring @xmath6 photons given that @xmath7 original photons arrived at the detector . using eq .",
    "[ eq : measured - orig relation ] , the original distribution can be reconstructed , in principle , by multiplying the measured distribution with the inverse of the distortion matrix .",
    "this method , however , is limited to relatively large probabilities and may produce non - physical results otherwise@xcite .",
    "another approach , which we use here , is to apply a fitting algorithm which finds the original distribution based on a goodness of fit test .",
    "the matrix @xmath4 can be written as a product of three matrices , @xmath8 , which represent the loss , dark counts ( dk ) and crosstalk ( _ ct _ ) effects .",
    "the individual matrices are constructed as follows :      the probability for loss is described by the relation@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the overall detection efficiency .",
    "the probability of dark counts is assumed to follow a poisson distribution@xcite of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the average number of dark counts .",
    "optical crosstalk occurs when a secondary photon generated during an electronic discharge in one apd element is detected in a neighboring apd element , thereby creating a secondary avalanche .",
    "photons produced in the secondary avalanches can then continue to trigger further avalanches in additional elements ( crosstalk - generated - crosstalk ) .",
    "the crosstalk probabilities in our model are calculated by dividing the crosstalk events into stages and recursively counting the number of possible crosstalk events in each stage .",
    "the recursion formula for the crosstalk matrix element is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined as the overall probability for a crosstalk - avalanche to be generated in any of the four neighboring elements .",
    "each stage has @xmath7 triggered elements which can trigger up to @xmath7 new crosstalk events .",
    "the probability of generating @xmath15 new crosstalk events is composed of the probability that @xmath15 elements out of the @xmath7 possible will generate crosstalk , while the remaining @xmath16 elements will not .",
    "this probability also includes the combinatorial factor of choosing the @xmath15 crosstalk - generating elements out of the possible @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath15 crosstalk - triggered elements continue to generate additional crosstalk events in a recursive way , until all of the @xmath17 crosstalk elements are triggered .",
    "this novel analytical crosstalk model does not limit the number of crosstalk events and also accounts for crosstalk - generated - crosstalk .",
    "the model was developed since other available analytical models  @xcite were inconsistent with our experimental results due to limitations on the crosstalk probability values and the number of crosstalk events .",
    "our model does not account for the geometrical arrangement of the apd elements in the detector , nor its finite size .",
    "however , we show below that for values within the experimental range , this analytical model agrees with a numerical model that has no such limitations@xcite .",
    "additionally , this model is less computationally demanding than the numerical model .",
    "thus , it is a useful tool in the interpretation of experimental data from photon - number resolving detectors , where crosstalk between the detection elements plays a crucial role .",
    "we have measured the photon - number distributions of the polarization modes of a stimulated type - ii collinear pdc process . the experimental setup is shown in fig .",

    "pulses of 150fs at a repetition rate of 250khz are amplified , frequency doubled to 390 nm and used to pump a 2 mm long type - ii collinear @xmath18 ( bbo ) nonlinear crystal .",
    "the degenerate wavelength signal and idler photons at 780 nm , which are created with orthogonal polarizations ( horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) ) , are split at a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) and detected separately using two photon - number resolving detectors .",
    "this work focuses on measuring the photon - number distribution of a single polarization mode .",
    "thus , the detection of both polarization modes is only used to evaluate the heralded detection efficiency of the sipm detector .",
    "the results presented for a single polarization mode also apply to the photon pair statistics , as a collinear process produces the same statistics for pairs and for individual photons . before the photons are coupled to the detectors , they are spectrally and spatially filtered by bandpass filters and by optical fibers , respectively . the number of spatial modes which are collected can be changed by using optical fibers with different core diameters and numerical apertures@xcite , and the number of collected spectral modes can be changed by using filters of different bandwidths .    the detection configuration is shown in fig .

    "the photon - number resolution error , which results from the overlapping between neighboring gaussians , is smaller than 1% below 12 photons and approaches 12% for 20 photons .",
    "the number of resolvable photons is limited due to the decrease of the signal to noise ratio as the number of photons is increased .    ]",
    "we demonstrate the use of our model for reconstructing the original photon statistics with the photon - number distribution measurements of a thermal state .",
    "the thermal state was generated by collecting a single polarization mode of pdc using the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . the original thermal distribution can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the average number of photons .",
    "the measured distribution exhibits a lower value of @xmath22 due to losses and deviates from the power - law dependence of eq .",
    "[ eq : pth_thermal ] due to optical crosstalk and dark counts .",
    "we measured the same thermal state with three different sets of values for the amount of loss , dark counts and crosstalk , obtained by operating the sipm detector with different bias voltage values@xcite .",
    "as a result , we obtained three different measured distributions , although the original photon - number distribution was the same .",
    "the measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model fits ] .",
    "the main distortions in the distributions are the low values of @xmath22 due to losses and the deviation from a straight line in the semi - log plot when the number of measured photons exceeds 1 .",
    "the latter is the effect of the crosstalk process , which falsely increases the probability of measuring high numbers of photons .",
    "the crosstalk probabilities of these measurements range from the highest probability value ( maximum bias voltage ) , which creates the highest deviation , to the minimal probability ( minimal bias voltage ) which creates the lowest deviation .    .",

    "[ eq : pth_thermal ] and @xmath22 is the only free parameter .",
    "the overall detection efficiency @xmath10 , the average number of dark counts @xmath12 , and the crosstalk probability @xmath14 , that are used for the construction of the distortion matrices , are measured separately .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is defined as the heralded efficiency between the two down - converted polarization modes and is determined by the ratio between two - photon coincidence and single - photon counts in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "the dark counts and crosstalk parameters are obtained through a separate measurement of the poissonian dark count statistics which are fit to the function @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a vector of zeros with 1 at the first position , and @xmath12 and @xmath14 are the free fit parameters .    all three measurements in fig .  [ fig : model fits ] were reconstructed to the same original state , within the margins of error , despite the different measured distributions .",
    "this result indicates the consistency of our evaluation of the dark counts , loss and crosstalk parameters .",
    "we compare these results to those obtained using the numerical crosstalk model introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the numerical model is based on simulations of the detection process , and takes into account the geometrical configuration of the detector , the finite number of detection elements , and possible attempts to trigger neighboring cells which have already been triggered .",
    "the model is characterized through a parameter @xmath46 , defined as the probability of generating crosstalk in one particular neighbor among the four nearest neighbors , rather than the overall probability of generating crosstalk among the nearest neighbors , which we define here as @xmath14 .",
    "the values of @xmath46 obtained from the fit correspond to the values of @xmath14 through the relation @xmath47@xcite .",
    "the agreement between the two models shows that although the analytical model does not account for the geometry of the detector , it provides a good description of the crosstalk process for all crosstalk values in the experimental range .",
    "we now consider the photon - number distributions of down - converted photons as a function of the number of collected modes . if @xmath6 photons are distributed among @xmath48 modes , such that @xmath49 , then the overall probability of measuring @xmath6 photons is given by@xcite : @xmath50 where the product @xmath51 is the joint probability of measuring @xmath52 photons in each mode @xmath53 , and the combinatorial factor amounts to the number of possible arrangements of @xmath6 indistinguishable photons into @xmath48 modes . if the photons are distributed evenly among the modes , the average number of photons in each mode is uniform and equals @xmath54 the photon - number distribution within each of the modes is thermal , @xmath55 , and by substituting eq .",
