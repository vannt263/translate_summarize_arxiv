    "0.2 in    the development of last century s mathematics has been enormously influenced by the desire to understand minimal surfaces .",
    "in such development the _ bernstein problem _ has played a central role .",
    "the latter states that a smooth complete minimal graph in @xmath5 , i.e. , a @xmath2 entire solution @xmath6 of the minimal surface equation @xmath7 must necessarily be an affine hyperplane .",
    "bernstein himself @xcite established this property when @xmath8 .",
    "almost fifty years later fleming @xcite gave a completely different proof still for the case @xmath9 , and also conjectured that bernstein result should be valid in any dimension .",
    "his approach inspired a new major development in the subject . in @xcite de giorgi was able to extend bernstein s theorem to the case @xmath10 .",
    "almgren @xcite subsequently succeeded in treating the case @xmath11 , and simons @xcite finally obtained a solution for @xmath12 . in their celebrated work @xcite bombieri , de giorgi and",
    "giusti established the surprising result that the bernstein property fails if @xmath13 , thus putting an end to the problem in euclidean space .",
    "they proved in fact that : _",
    "if @xmath13 there exist complete minimal graphs in @xmath5 which are not hyperplanes_. for additional references and developments the reader should also consult @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is investigating the bernstein problem in the first heisenberg group @xmath0 .",
    "this is the simplest and most important non - abelian model of a class of graded , nilpotent lie groups known as carnot groups . such groups arise naturally as tangent spaces to sub - riemannian manifolds , also known as carnot - carathodory spaces , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for @xmath14 ,",

    "minimal surfaces are surfaces of least perimeter , or area , among all those with the same boundary . in a carnot - carathodory space an appropriate sub - riemannian version of perimeter generalizing the classical one due to de giorgi was introduced in @xcite , and further developed in @xcite , see also the papers @xcite and @xcite where two equivalent definitions were independently set forth . to provide the reader with a broader perspective of the results in this paper , it may be useful to recall the relevant definitions in the setting of a carnot group @xmath40 with a given subbundle @xmath41 , and a distribution of smooth vector fields @xmath42 which is bracket - generating for @xmath43 .",

    "this notion of a minimal surface was independently introduced in @xcite and @xcite , and the present paper was inspired by these works .",
    "of course , the concept of horizontal mean curvature plays a central role here . just as the gauss map guides the theory of euclidean minimal surfaces , the _ horizontal gauss map _ dominates the study of @xmath3-minimal surfaces . to define this notion",

    "it may be helpful for the reader to know that there exists a close connection between such notion of minimal surface and the geometric measure theoretic one introduced in @xcite .",

    "nhieu developed a sub - riemannian calculus for hypersurfaces in carnot groups .",
    "in @xcite they also determined , under some conditions , the isoperimetric sets in the heisenberg group , i.e. , those bounded sets which minimize the @xmath3-perimeter under a volume costraint , and they proved that their boundaries are @xmath2 ( but not @xmath86 ! ) hypersurfaces with positive constant @xmath3-mean curvature . in the same paper",
    "the following sub - riemannian bernstein problem was formulated : consider a complete @xmath3-minimal surface @xmath87 .",
    "under which assumptions on @xmath15 and @xmath1 is it true that @xmath1 must be a vertical hyperplane , i.e. , there exist @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , such that @xmath90    one easily recognizes that the vertical hyperplanes in are @xmath3-minimal ( however , _ any _ hyperplane in @xmath15 is @xmath3-minimal . in particular , such is the characteristic hyperplane @xmath91 ) .",
    "the following conjecture was proposed .    0.2 in    * conjecture : * _ in the heisenberg group @xmath15 , at least in low dimension",
    ", the bernstein property should hold provided that the surface @xmath1 is an entire graph , and has empty characteristic locus . in particular , suppose that @xmath1 is a @xmath2 entire graph in the first heisenberg group @xmath0 , and assume that @xmath1 has empty characteristic locus , then @xmath1 must be a vertical plane .",

    "we note explicitly that the set @xmath101 introduced above is given by @xmath102 .",
    "some comments concerning the above conjecture are necessary .",
    "substantial evidence seems in favor of it . on one hand",
    ", there is the close relation between the bernstein property and the classical liouville theorem for harmonic functions .",
    "such connection continues to hold in the sub - riemannian setting .",
    "now , the liouville property in @xmath15 presents a striking new phenomenon with respect to the classical setting , namely that if @xmath47 is a bounded entire solution of the sub - laplacian in @xmath15 , then @xmath47 depends _ only _ on the horizontal variables @xmath103 . as a consequence , such a function must , in fact , be an ordinary harmonic function in @xmath104 , and therefore by the classical liouville theorem it is constant . secondly , and perhaps more importantly , a basic result in @xcite shows that when one adapts de giorgi s method of the blow - up to the sub - riemannian setting of @xmath15 , one obtains in the limit blow - up sets which are vertical ( non - characteristic ) planes as in . by imposing the non - characteristic assumption in the conjecture one rules thus out the undesired @xmath3-minimal characteristic hyperplanes such as @xmath91 .    in light of this evidence",
    ", our inital efforts went in the direction of proving the conjecture true . in the process of establishing its veracity ,",
    "we have developed a basic representation result for a graph - like @xmath3-minimal surface which is based on the notions of seed curve and height function , see theorem [ mrep ] .",
    "while analyzing the various possibilities , however , we have made the striking discovery that the above conjecture is in fact not true .",
    "* counterexample to the conjecture : * _ the real analytic surface @xmath105 is an entire @xmath3-minimal graph , with empty characteristic locus , over the coordinate @xmath106-plane in @xmath0 . _    this counterexample , which will be analyzed in detail in sections [ s : examples ] and [ s : return ] , shows the failure of the above formulated sub - riemannian counterpart of the classical bernstein property .",
    "nonetheless , in this paper we prove a result , theorem [ maintheorem ] , which we feel is in fact closest in spirit to the classical theorem of bernstein .",
    "to precisely state this theorem , we first introduce some definitions , and present some results of independent interest which are fundamental in the proof of the main theorem .    to study @xmath3-minimal surfaces , we form a set of coordinates which are adapted to the horizontal gauss map on portions of the surface which are graphs over a domain in the @xmath107-plane .",
    "in this sense , they are analogous to isothermal coordinates on minimal surfaces in @xmath108 .",
    "roughly , for an @xmath3-minimal surface @xmath1 written as a graph @xmath109 for a @xmath2 function @xmath110 over a domain @xmath48 of the @xmath107-plane where @xmath1 has empty characteristic locus , we consider the unit horizontal gauss map of this surface . setting @xmath111 and @xmath112 , we have @xmath113    as the @xmath3-minimal surface in question is a graph over the @xmath107-plane , we have @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and thus the horizontal gauss map @xmath116 on @xmath1 depends in fact only on the variables @xmath117 . by abuse of notation",

    "is defined to be the integral curve of the vector field @xmath127 with initial point @xmath126 .",

    "one consequence of the representation in theorem a is that @xmath3-minimal surfaces are , in fact , ruled surfaces .",

    "we stress that theorem a is useful in both the study of known examples as well as in the construction of new @xmath3-minimal surfaces . indeed , in sections [",

    "seed curves associated to @xmath3-minimal surfaces are our fundamental objects of study . with this in mind ,",
    "we introduce the following definition .",
    "if no portion of a @xmath2 , complete , connected @xmath3-minimal surface can be written as a graph over the @xmath107-plane , we say that @xmath1 has _ trivial seed curve_. otherwise , @xmath1 has a _ non - trivial seed curve_.    in this definition and subsequent theorems , we will use the term _ complete surface _ to denote a metrically complete open surface in the heisenberg group .",
    "we show in lemma [ trivial ] that if @xmath1 has trivial seed curve , then @xmath1 must be a vertical plane as in .",
    "however , to completely describe an @xmath3-minimal surface we need to suitably extend to notion of seed curve .",
    "generalized seed curve _ is a collection of seed curves and associated height functions together with patching data which define a single curve in @xmath152 , see definition [ d : genseed ] .",

    "[ cleanup]let @xmath62 be a @xmath2 , complete , connected @xmath3-minimal surface . then , either @xmath1 is a vertical plane , or @xmath1 is determined by a generalized seed curve .    in the following definition the signed curvature @xmath157 of a seed curve",

    "[ d : introcc ] an @xmath3-minimal surface is said to have _ constant curvature _ if either it has trivial seed curve ( in which case @xmath1 is a vertical plane ) , or if the signed curvature @xmath157 of each seed curve which is part of the generalized seed curve defining the @xmath3-minimal surface is constant .",
    "we emphasize two important points concerning this definition .",
    "first , that the assumption of constant curvature does not imply that the curve in @xmath156 defined by the generalized seed curve , @xmath158 , has constant curvature , merely that the seed curves , @xmath159 , do .",
    "indeed , example [ e : gencurve ] explicitly shows this : each of its seed curves are straight lines ( constant curvature zero ) but the lifted curves , @xmath160 do not have constant curvature .",
    "second , we point out that the individual seed curves , @xmath159 , for an @xmath3-minimal surface of constant curvature may have different signed curvatures for different @xmath161 . a method to construct examples of such behavior",
    "is described after definition [ d : constcurv ] .",
    "we can now state our main result .",
    "[ maintheorem ] let @xmath1 be a @xmath2 connected @xmath3-minimal surface which is a graph over some plane @xmath4 , then @xmath1 has constant curvature according to definition [ d : introcc ] .",
    "when the complete @xmath3-minimal surface @xmath1 fails to be a graph , then it need not have constant curvature .",
    "an example is given by the sub - riemannian catenoids in examples , .",
    "we stress that in the theorem c we have made no assumption concerning the characteristic locus of @xmath1 .",
    "theorem c points out a rigidity of the seed curve under the assumption that the @xmath3-minimal surface is a graph : it must be composed of circles or lines . in the case where all the seed curves in the generalized seed curve are circles ,",
    "@xmath1 may or may not have empty characteristic locus .",
    "however , in the case where at least one seed curve in the generalized seed curve is a straight line , we see that by ( 2 ) in remark [ r : rems ] , @xmath1 always has non - empty characteristic locus .",
    "we stress , however , that there are many graph - like @xmath3-minimal surfaces given simply by specifying different initial height functions . for instance , the @xmath3-minimal surface in the counterexample above , is a graph over the @xmath162-plane , it has empty characteristic locus , see example [ e : ce ] , and as we show in example [ e : ceseed ] its generalized seed curve consists of a single seed curve which is a circle .",
    "the plane @xmath163 is a graph over the @xmath107-plane , it has non - empty characteristic locus , and again its single seed curve is a circle , see example [ e : comp ] . on the other hand , we will construct a surface which is a graph over the @xmath107-plane , has non - empty characteristic locus and seed curve a straight line , see examples [ e : hyp ] and [ e : hyp2 ] . in connection with this latter example , if we further restrict our attention to graphs over the @xmath107-plane , then we can completely classify the possible @xmath3-minimal surfaces .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a @xmath2 connected @xmath3-minimal graph over the entire @xmath107-plane , then :    1 .",
    "either @xmath1 has seed curve a circle , and @xmath1 is a plane of the form @xmath164 for some real numbers @xmath165 , with @xmath166 , ( with characteristic locus @xmath167 ) .",
    "2 .   or , @xmath1 has seed curve a straight line , and @xmath1 can be written as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a point in @xmath108 and @xmath170 are constants so that @xmath171 .",
    "we note that , if we left translate so that the point @xmath169 is moved to the origin and further compose with an appropriate rotation about the @xmath172-axis , we can write these surfaces as : @xmath173 in addition , we note that the both of these classes of surfaces were found in @xcite , and , after the appropriate changes to reflect the difference in the representation of the heiseneberg group , the second set of examples can be written as @xmath174 for some real number @xmath175 , and some function @xmath176 ( which is of course equivalent to the choice of @xmath153 ) .",
    "we mention in closing that theorem d has been first established in the recent paper @xcite , but with a completely different approach from ours .",
    "besides theorem d , the paper @xcite contains several other interesting results and also deals with the heisenberg group from the broader perspective of three - dimensional cr manifolds .",
    "the analysis in @xcite is based on a detailed study of the characteristic locus of @xmath1 , whereas our approach is centered on the concepts of seed curve and height function .",

    "assume first that equation is not satisfied and consider @xmath1093 .",

    ", we have that @xmath1108 satisfies the definition of a generalized seed curve .",
    "moreover , we now have that @xmath1094 and @xmath1095 are connected by a vertical line for all @xmath161 and so taking all the @xmath1109 patched together with the vertical segments describes a single curve in @xmath156 . by construction",
    ", this curve characterizes the h - minimal surface @xmath1 .",
    "to finish the proof , we note that if @xmath1110 is an empty list , then @xmath1 has trivial seed curve and must be a vertical plane .",
    "[ r : genreg ] we remark that the gluing of graphical pieces to vertical pieces that can occur in the previous theorem in the presence of regularity assumptions imposes more conditions on the @xmath1109 . in particular , the condition that @xmath1111 tends to @xmath669 ensures that the resulting glued surface is at least @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a @xmath142 surface , then the normal vector would need be @xmath441 .",
    "for example , consider the case where a component of @xmath385 contained a portion of a vertical plane that had non empty interior that was glued an @xmath804 .",
    "as the normal vector to any portion of a vertical plane is constant , we see that a necessary and sufficient condition for the glued surface to be @xmath142 is that @xmath562 derivatives of the normal vector to @xmath804 tend to zero as we tend towards the portion of the boundary of @xmath804 that meets the vertical plane .",
    "we note that if one is constructing h - minimal surfaces by hand via picking seed curves , height functions and vertical planes , this condition can be quite complicated to write down due to the multitude of possibilities allowed by a generalized seed curve .",
    "[ e : gencurve ] _ in this example , we will construct a variety of surfaces that are best described in using a generalized seed curve , and some that can only be described in terms of a generalized seed curve .",
    "we will define two pieces of the surface , @xmath686 and @xmath687 , that are graphs over the xy - plane , both of which have seed curve a straight line .",
    "to do so , let @xmath1112 and let @xmath1113 from these choices , we have that @xmath686 is given by : @xmath1114 or , equivalently , by @xmath1115 .",
    "similarly , @xmath687 is given as the portion of @xmath1115 with @xmath1116 .",
    "these two pieces are joined by a single line , @xmath385 , given by @xmath1117 where the tangent plane to the glued surface @xmath1118 is equal to the vertical plane @xmath309 .",
    "this surface @xmath1119 is characterized by the generalized seed curve : @xmath1120 as we can write this surface as @xmath1115 , it is obviously real analytic .",
    "we note that simply by changing the height functions , we get a family of similar h - minimal surfaces .",
    "for example , the surface @xmath1121 is an h - minimal surface for any nonzero integer @xmath1122 and is determined by a generalized seed curve as follows . if @xmath1122 is even , then the generalized seed curve is @xmath1123 whereas if @xmath1122 is odd , the generalized seed curve is @xmath1124 we note that when @xmath1122 is even , the surface @xmath1121 can only be described by a generalized seed curve . _    [ d : constcurv ] an @xmath3-minimal surface has _ constant curvature _ if either it has trivial seed curve , or if the signed curvature @xmath157 of each seed curve in its generalized seed curve is constant .",
    "we pause to emphasize two important points .",
    "first , that the assumption of constant curvature does not imply that the curve in @xmath156 defined by the generalized seed curve , @xmath1125 , has constant curvature , merely that the @xmath159 do .",
    "indeed , example [ e : gencurve ] explicitly shows this : each of its seed curves are lines ( constant curvature zero ) but the lifted curves , @xmath160 do not have constant curvature .",
    "second , we point out that the individual seed curves , @xmath159 , for an @xmath3-minimal surface of constant curvature may have different signed curvatures for different @xmath161 . we outline a method to construct examples where this can happen .",
    "we will construct an @xmath3-minimal surface which has three pieces , @xmath686 and @xmath687 , which are graphs over the @xmath107-plane and a single line @xmath835 so that @xmath1126 . moreover , along @xmath835 , the surface is tangent to a vertical plane . to define @xmath686 ,",
    "we pick the seed curve , @xmath1127 , to be a straight line and choose the initial height function , @xmath1128 , so that @xmath1129 tends to @xmath1130 as @xmath1131 .",
    "to define @xmath687 , pick the seed curve , @xmath1132 , to be a circle with @xmath1133 and choose the initial height function , @xmath1134 , so that @xmath1135 tends to @xmath1136 as @xmath1137 and @xmath1138 .",
    "this type of example is very similar to example [ e : gencurve ] where instead of picking one seed curve to be a circle and one to be a line , we have that both seed curves are lines .",
    "we note that in light of remark [ r : genreg ] this type of gluing may lower the overall regularity of the surface , unless further restrictions are placed on @xmath805 .    0.6 in",
