    "<S> fig : fig2](a ) , but on the higher density side of @xmath1 . across the transitions </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath85 monotonically increases with @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the hexatic - liquid transition is continuous and agrees with the kthny theory . </S>",
    "<S> we have also verified that the same phenomenon occurs at all other temperatures .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] , we further compare the system size dependence of the isobaric density @xmath41 , enthalpy @xmath86 and average bond - orientational order @xmath87 calculated in the @xmath72 ensemble on both sides of @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath88 denotes average over particles and configurations . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath54 , all quantities apparently tend to be discontinuous with increasing system size , while they do not show such a tendency when @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] provide robust evidence to suggest that the hexatic - liquid transition undergoes a transition from discontinuous to continuous , with the melting at @xmath0 being a possible transition point . in section </S>",
    "<S> iv of the supplemental material @xcite , we provide another evidence by showing that the correlation length in the liquid phase tends to diverge approaching the maximum melting temperature from the @xmath12 side . </S>",
    "<S> two different types of hexatic - liquid transition can be achieved in the same system , just by tuning the density . </S>",
    "<S> now there comes the question of whether the scenario is specific to systems described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ potential ] ) or exists in other soft - core systems . </S>",
    "<S> next , we will examine the widely studied gaussian - core model and show that our observations are not unique to hertzian and harmonic repulsions .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential between interacting particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the gaussian - core model is @xmath89 , with all parameters having the same meanings as for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ potential ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we set a potential cutoff at @xmath90 and shift the potential to make sure that both the potential and force vanish at @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the same set of units as for hertzian and harmonic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian - core model exhibits reentrant crystallization with maximum melting temperature @xmath92 happening at @xmath93 and @xmath94 estimated from the phase diagram of @xmath38 systems @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> isothermal equation of state @xmath59 across the transitions for @xmath95 gaussian - core disks calculated at @xmath96 and at ( a ) @xmath97 and ( b ) @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the line in ( a ) is the @xmath62 order polynomial fit to the data , while in ( b ) is to guide the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the legend in ( b ) explains the meaning of the symbols in both panels . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to ( a ) shows the temperature dependence of the density interval of phase coexistence @xmath65 . the data can be well fitted with @xmath66 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure  [ fig : fig4 ] compares isothermal @xmath59 for gaussian - core model calculated in the @xmath71 ensemble on both sides of @xmath1 and at @xmath100 . like hertzian and harmonic repulsions , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](a ) shows that @xmath59 at @xmath12 has a clear mayer - wood loop , so the hexatic - liquid transition here is discontinuous . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](a ) shows that the coexistent region @xmath65 also decreases with increasing temperature and can be well fitted with @xmath101 , where @xmath102 agrees well with @xmath0 estimated from the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> again , for gaussian - core model , melting at @xmath0 is likely to become continuous . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the continuity of the transitions above @xmath1 is robust . the @xmath59 curve at @xmath13 shown in fig .  [ fig : fig4](b ) is rather straight across the melting with an almost density independent compressibility .    by studying three representative soft - core models exhibiting reentrant crystallization </S>",
    "<S> , we find that both continuous and discontinuous hexatic - liquid transitions happen in the same system . </S>",
    "<S> the type of the transition is determined by density . </S>",
    "<S> our data suggest that the melting point at the maximum melting temperature may be the demarcation between the two types of transitions . </S>",
    "<S> note that hertzian and harmonic models are quite different from gaussian - core model @xcite , but they still behave similarly in the hexatic - liquid transition . although it is impossible to check all models , based on our study , we are inclined to believe that our observations generalize to soft - core systems with reentrant crystallization . anyhow , our study reveals the unknown extraordinary features of two - dimensional melting of soft - core systems , which can be tested in experimental systems such as star polymers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the hexatic phase , the existence of the analogous tetratic phase upon the melting of solids with square lattice structure has been reported and discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , compared to the hexatic phase , the tetratic phase is much less studied . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason is that the square lattice structure is more difficult to form than the triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> hertzian and harmonic models exhibit multiple reentrant crystallizations with various solid structures , which are ideal to investigate the tetratic phase and other intermediate phases </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to know next if we are able to observe different intermediate phases in these simple model systems and if the melting of various types of solids follows similar scenarios or not .    </S>",
