    "we study two magnetic thin - film heterostructures similar to fig .  [",
    "fig : mat_stack]b purely from _ ab initio _ : fcc - overlayers of pd / fe and pd / pd / fe on single - crystal bulk fcc - ir(111 ) .",
    "these systems are attractive for a number of reasons .",
    "first , they generate large dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions ( dmis)@xmath26 , whose competition with the isotropic exchange interaction @xmath27 determines the size and chirality of the skyrmions@xmath4 .",
    "dmis are large here because of the strength and nature of the inversion - symmetry - breaking in the heterostructures . at the fe / ir(111 ) interface , a large spin - orbit interaction in the underlying heavy - metal substrate , here ir(111 ) ,",
    "is relatively uncompensated by the overlayer pd / fe or pd / pd / fe interface , leading to a large dmi vector preferentially in the plane of fe , denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath29 , along with an external magnetic field , can stabilize isolated skyrmions with diameter @xmath301 - 5 nm in size , and has been shown experimentally@xmath31 .",
    "second , by choosing a double - pd overlayer ( pd / pd / fe / ir ) versus a single - pd overlayer ( pd / fe / ir ) , one can alter the exchange interactions in fe due to the modified nature of the interface hybridization and electronic charge transfer ( see supplementary information s1 ) .",
    "we investigate this effect to illuminate conceptual studies where other overlayer combinations and materials are used to engineer the size , shape , and stability of the isolated skyrmions@xmath32 .",
    "we perform self - consistent density functional theory ( dft ) calculations based on a full - potential green function formalism including soi@xmath33 , which allows a perfect embedding of _ real_-space defects , such as isolated skyrmions , into the ferromagnetic background system .",
    "additional specifics of our computational scheme are given in the methods section .      before coming to the essential physics of the tunneling spin - mixing magnetoresistance ( txmr ) effect",
    ", we first self - consistently relax different - sized nano - skyrmions in otherwise ferromagnetic backgrounds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all_spins ] ) , in both single- and double - pd overlayer material stacks .",
    "we control the size of the skyrmionic defects by allowing different finite numbers of atoms to relax their magnetic moments in size and direction after the central atom has been spin - flipped as an initial condition .",
    "we investigate four different realistic skyrmion sizes : @xmath34 1.1 , 1.7 , 2.2 , and 2.7  nm in diameter .",
    "the spin - textures exhibit a fixed and unique rotational sense as demanded by the dmi , which seeks energy gain by torquing the moments to rotate with respect to their neighbors .",
    "these structures are cycloidal and radial in nature as expected for magnetic thin - films . thus our theoretical calculations are consistent in generating realistic nano - skyrmions which have been experimentally detected using _ magnetic _ spin - polarized currents@xmath31 .",
    "we illustrate the spin - moment global rotation vs.  the vertical ( polar angle @xmath35 ) of each atom and the pairwise difference between adjacent polar angles ( d@xmath35 ) .",
    "we will show that the spin - mixing perturbations to the local - density - of - states ( ldos ) are a function of these angular parameters because the relative canting between different pairwise atomic sites varies as a function of space , in addition to the absolute canting relative to the substrate .",
    "when analyzing each individual confined structure , we mention that d@xmath35 itself is not constant between different pairs of atoms , such that there exists an inhomogeneity on the atomic - scale in the rotation of the magnetization direction with respect to the substrate plane . furthermore , these inhomogeneities themselves are a function of diameter when comparing skyrmions of different sizes ( fig .  [",
    "fig : all_spins]a , b , c ) .",
    "we now move to establish the physics behind the txmr effect within a scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm or sts ) experiment employing a _ non_-spin - polarized tip , for which according to the tersoff - hamann model@xmath36 , the differential conductance d@xmath37/d@xmath38 is proportional to the ldos of the sample , calculated at the tip position , @xmath39 , and the given bias energy @xmath40 : @xmath41 the ldos depends on the configuration @xmath42 of atomic spins of the sample ( i ) relative to each other , e.g.  in terms of d@xmath43 for all atom - pairs @xmath44 , and ( ii ) relative to the lattice in terms of the absolute polar angle @xmath45 .",
    "the transport phenomenon related to the latter is known as the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance ( tamr)@xmath23 , an effect related to spin - mixing due to the soi .",
    "the former results from the spin - mixing hybridization of majority- and minority - states due to non - collinearity . both can be subsumed as tunneling spin - mixing magnetoresistance ( txmr ) .",
    "common to both is that the probability of tunneling into majority- and minority - states depends on angles .",
    "the difference is that ( i ) is expected to be larger than ( ii ) , since it is not a soi effect .",
    "also the appearance of both are different .",
    "for example , the txmr due to ( i ) in a homogeneous magnetic spiral is the same across the spiral , because d@xmath46d@xmath35 for all atom - pairs @xmath47 , but different for spirals of different pitches under the transformation d@xmath48d@xmath49 . in contrast",
    ", the tamr is modulated _ across _ the spiral@xmath25 as @xmath45 changes from atom - to - atom .",
    "thus , the txmr is used to measure conductance differences between two different magnetic states such as the difference between a skyrmion and the fm - state , but can also be used to resolve magnetization inhomogenieties inside complex spin - textures such as skyrmions or domain - walls .",
    "since the spin - mixing perturbations due to non - collinearity and soi are magnetic in nature , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldoss]a the spin - dependent ldos in the magnetically - active fe - layer as a function of the atomic position for the @xmath50  nm skrymion . for brevity",
    "we plot only the pd / fe / ir case ( see supplementary information s2 for the larger @xmath51  nm case and s3 for the double - pd cases ) .",
    "we note that the majority and minority spin - channels are given in the local spin - frame of reference for each fe - atom .",
    "the color - coding of the plot , which corresponds to different atoms extending radially from the skyrmion s center , is explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldoss]c .",
    "the energy - zero is the fermi energy , @xmath52 .",
    "the resonant - states between @xmath53 and @xmath54  ev above @xmath55 are of fe @xmath56-band minority - spin character and consist of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 states .",
    "these states hybridize with the @xmath60 states in the pd - overlayer and give rise to fe - pd-@xmath61 hybrid states , named in short pd-@xmath59 states localized in the pd overlayer - film around @xmath620.5 ev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldoss]b ( black - dashed curve ) .",
    "it is clear that the surface - layer pd-@xmath59 state ( shown only for the background - fm pd - surface film ) , which has the proper orbital symmetry to decay slowly transverse to the substrate , controls the electronic structure in vacuum as a function of energy , characterized by a strong resonance in the vacuum - ldos .",
    "an all - electrical sts measurement will be sensitive to this vacuum resonance - peak .",
    "the origin of this resonance and its behavior upon rotation can be understood by analyzing the energy window near @xmath63  ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldoss]a , where one can see the resonance - peaks shifting in energy in the fe skyrmion - ldos as a function of position . the green curve , which represents the ferromagnetic state of the background fe - film , shows an electronic structure consistent with fe - minority @xmath56-@xmath56 hybridization when adjacent atoms couple ferromagnetically ( see supplementary section s2 ) .",
    "conversely , moving towards the center of the skyrmion , the quantization axes between two neighboring atoms becomes different , and majority - states of one atom can hybridize with minority - states of the second .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced at the central spin - flipped atom ( black curve ) , where the resonance - peak has shifted lower in energy  as expected for _ antiferromagnetic _ ( afm ) coupling ( see supplementary section s2 ) .",
    "we reproduce these effects within the context of a simple model , where we can qualitatively predict the change in ldos as a function of the non - collinear magnetization rotation parameter d@xmath35 as defined in fig .  [",
    "fig : all_spins]a ( see supplementary information s4 and s5 ) .",
    "the energy - dependent disturbance to the ldos resonance - peaks as a function of position moving radially along the skyrmion will manifest as a perturbation to the local electrical conductivity , and is the physical basis for the space - dependent txmr effect .",
    "we now define the txmr and make predictions for future experimental observation of the effect .",
    "the txmr is the percent deviation of the local conductance from a reference conductance due to the spin - mixing from non - collinearity and soi .",
    "as long as the magnetic state under consideration has a different non - collinearity than the reference state , there will be a txmr .",
    "if one is interested in the spatial resolution of a complex spin texture ( ignoring soi ) , however , then an additional inhomogeneity within the non - collinearity is required , as is the case for nano - skyrmions .",
    "the txmr is by definition measured in vacuum . here",
    ", we choose the reference to be somewhere far from the skyrmion in the fm - background .",
    "then the normalized txmr measured at site @xmath64 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the ldos in the vacuum just above the fm , and @xmath67 is the ldos of the complex spin - texture in the vacuum just above site @xmath64 .    integrating the txmr over the entire device injection boundary , over all energies up to the bias energy @xmath68 , would give a measure of the total change in conductance , and would be the state - of - bit detection mechanism in a cpp - txmr device like discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mat_stack]a . in an sts experiment , however , the effect could be amplified by selecting specific energy windows where the txmr were largest as a function of position .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : txmr]a , b we show the energy - resolved txmr of the @xmath34 1.7 nm skyrmion s central spin - flipped vacuum - site , with and without soi , for the single- and double - pd cases .",
    "we notice a sizeable txmr effect for both systems .",
    "this holds true for all skyrmions that we studied , noting a small size - dependence of the effect which varies weakly as a function of @xmath69 ( see supplementary information s6 ) .",
    "txmr signals in the different single - pd and double - pd material systems vary from skyrmion - to - skyrmion , however .",
    "since the soi arises from the fe - ir interface , the impact of soi is much more pronounced in the single - pd system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txmr]a ) , where the txmr can peak out at an impressive @xmath040% when ignoring spin - orbit coupling , but decreases down to @xmath70% when soi is included",
    ". interestingly , the spin - mixing due to soi is to compete with the effects due to inhomogeneous non - collinearity , reducing the overall txmr signal . in the double - pd system ,",
    "most of the txmr signal is due to inhomogeneous non - collinearity , with a small contribution coming from the soi ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txmr]b ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : txmr]c , d we plot the spacial variation of the txmr signal , which differs significantly from atom - to - atom within the same skyrmion .",
    "we see that the txmr effect is reduced when approaching the edge of the skyrmion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txmr]c , d blue curves ) , since the effective non - collinearity is reduced as the complex spin - texture fades into the ferromagnetic background .    the vacuum - resonance we found in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldoss]b appears now as a large txmr signal at the same energy in the pd / fe / ir(111 ) system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txmr]a , c ) .",
    "thus , an experimentalist probing the surface in a sts experiment , having set the ripple - bias voltage near @xmath71v , would see an electrical contrast as visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : txmr]e when approaching a skyrmion of similar size in the single - pd heterostructure .    within a reasonable bias voltage range",
    ", the txmr effect is smaller in the double - pd case ( @xmath010% ) when compared to the single - pd case ( @xmath020% ) .",
    "the additional pd - overlayer changes the resonance nature around 0.5 ev compared to the single - pd case , and states with a high tunneling cross - section into the vacuum are distributed over a wider energy ( see supplementary information s3 ) . as a consequence",
    ", the txmr is reduced by nearly half when compared to the single - pd case , and a bias energy near @xmath72  ev is experimentally more favorable .",
    "we have studied realistic- and experimentally - observable confined nano - skyrmions within metallic thin - films of pd / fe / ir(111 ) and pd / pd / fe / ir(111 ) completely from first - principles .",
    "we established how the combined effects of local inhomogeneous magnetic non - collinearity and soi in nano - skyrmions can alter the atomistic electronic structure in a magnetically active fe - film , and , via hybridization with additional surface layers , the electrons which tunnel into the vacuum .",
    "the change in the ldos can be understood in terms of the rotation parameters of the magnetic moment of the considered atom .",
    "the largest spin - mixing contribution comes from non - collinearity and depends on the relative canting between magnetic moments on neighboring sites , d@xmath35 .",
    "the dependence on the absolute polar angle of the magnetic moment with respect to the substrate , @xmath35 , comes in as a second - order term to the change in the ldos , but can become important if the impact of the soi is large .    finally , we have shown in detail how such a physical interplay could induce a sizeable electrical conduction anisotropy as a function of position and energy in realistic nano - skyrmions , up to @xmath020% in the single - pd case .",
    "the manifestation of this txmr effect could possibly be exploited in an all - electrical tunneling spectroscopy experiment .",
    "in addition , the changes in the magnetoresistance on the nanometer scale of skyrmions can possibly be engineered to design advanced magnetic memory devices .",
    "typical memory circuits require at least one control device ( either transistor or diode ) in each memory cell .",
    "instead , technologies based on spin - mixing in single skyrmions could have potentially hundreds of bits stored in nanometer - sized magnetic racetracks needing only a single read - out element to detect the contents of each array ( see supplementary information s7 ) .",
    "the electronic structure was determined employing density functional theory ( dft ) in the local spin density approximation@xmath73 .",
    "calculations were executed by means of the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker full - potential scalar - relativistic green function method@xmath33 , where spin - orbit coupling was included self - consistently .",
    "a full - potential method is important to accurately describe the nature of the complex spin - texture and rapidly - decaying vacuum states of the tunneling electrons .    for the calculations we chose an angular momentum cutoff of @xmath74 = 3 for the orbital expansions of the green functions .",
    "the energy contour for numeric integration of the spin and charge density contained 40 grid points in the upper complex plane ( including 7 matsubara poles ) with a brillouin zone mesh of 30@xmath7530 @xmath76-points .",
    "the fm - slab ldos and skyrmion impurity cluster ldos were obtained by one - shot calculations using the fm - state or skyrmion - state as starting points , respectively . we found that increasing the @xmath76-mesh to 200@xmath75200 was sufficiently adequate to numerically stabilize the relevant observables .",
    "the magnetic thin - film slab configurations follow , where positive percentages refer to inward relaxation with respect to the ir(111 ) interlayer separation .",
    "we consider only fcc - stacking in all cases , which is in fact energetically favorable compared to hcp crystal growth@xmath77 .",
    "\\(a ) pd / fe / ir : 44 total layers ( 3 vacuum + 1 vacuum ( -1% ) + 1 pd ( 8% ) + 1 fe ( 7% ) + 1 ir ( 1% ) + 33 ir + 4 vacuum ) .",
    "\\(b ) pd / pd / fe / ir : 44 total layers ( 3 vacuum + 1 pd ( -1% ) + 1 pd ( 8% ) + 1 fe ( 7% ) + 1 ir ( 1% ) + 33 ir + 4 vacuum ) .",
    "we choose 34 ir layers since it was the minimum thickness by which we completely decoupled any wave function penetration from top - to - bottom surface .",
    "we obtained the relaxation parameters as optimized and reported by dup _ _ et al__@xmath77 .    to stabilize skyrmions after determining the 2d - fm slabs ,",
    "the slab green functions were harvested and a single spin - flipped fe - atom was embedded in the fm - background .",
    "we then allowed three - layer cylindrical ring - like stacks of atoms within the skyrmion impurity cluster to update their potentials and magnetic moments ( fe - layer + 1 pd - layer above and 1 ir - layer below ) .",
    "the effect of the fm - background was included self - consistently by the slab green function ( @xmath78 ) , which connects the skyrmion impurity cluster ( @xmath79 ) to the host via the dyson - like equation : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 represents the modified atomic potential as compared to the unperturbed slab green function potential , @xmath38 .",
    "in such a manner a real - space defect can be perfectly embedded in an otherwise periodic crystal . after converging the different sized skyrmionic profiles ,",
    "observables were calculated as mentioned previously .",

    "<S> the information is encoded by manipulation of different spacial magnetic domains , and the data is read by sensing the variation in the magnetoresistance as a function of the magnetization direction@xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> incorporation of magnetic skyrmions instead of domain walls ( dws ) may improve device performance and scaling possibilities@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> dws are sensitive to defect - pinning@xmath5 while skyrmions intrinsically are not@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this insensitivity to defects explains why skyrmions can be moved by electric current densities orders of magnitude smaller than dws@xmath7 while achieving smaller yet still sizeable magnitudes of velocity@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> skyrmions , for topological reasons@xmath9 , are relatively robust magnetic particle - like configurations@xmath10 , stable even up to , so far , near - room temperature@xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> . they can be confined at will and their shape and size controlled with an external magnetic field@xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> an illustrative device scaling route is an extension@xmath4 of the racetrack memory@xmath13 to incorporate single@xmath14 confined magnetic skyrmions instead of dws . </S>",
    "<S> such a concept constitutes an ultimate scaling alternative in terms of packing density , speed , and power consumption@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we envision a thin - film magnetic heterostructure@xmath15 where sub-5 nm chiral skyrmionic quasiparticles are generated ( via materials engineering and external magnetic fields ) and moved laterally along a magnetic racetrack by in - plane currents , which has been shown experimentally@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the bit - wise data would be encoded by out - of - plane currents which create or annihilate the individual skyrmions , thus setting or resetting the bit - state . </S>",
    "<S> this has also been shown experimentally@xmath17 ; thus , two important ingredients to a viable skyrmion racetrack memory system , lateral bit - wise movement and set / reset of each bit - state , have been established experimentally .    but how could one _ read _ each bit - state ? </S>",
    "<S> current - in - plane ( cip ) detection of skyrmions has been shown experimentally@xmath18 and understood theoretically as a topological hall effect@xmath19 , but may be costly in terms of power consumption and difficult to fabricate in terms of device geometries . </S>",
    "<S> a better option would be the direct detection of the nano - skyrmions via current - perpendicular - to - plane ( cpp)@xmath20 geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that such a detection mechanism for single skyrmions is indeed possible , even using non - spin - polarized electric currents . using fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mat_stack]a as a schematic illustration , we will show how the tunneling current between a suspended metal contact through vacuum depends on the non - collinear magnetic state - of - phase below . </S>",
    "<S> ( suspended metal contacts are possible with state - of - the - art fabrication techniques@xmath21 , but one could _ also _ imagine tunneling through a weakly - interacting two - dimensional ( 2d ) insulator , such as hbn or mos@xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a process can be intimately understood in a non - spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiment , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mat_stack]b . </S>",
    "<S> this all - electrical detection is a departure from typical experiments which rely on spin - polarized injection to detect magnetic structures , and thus inherently an improvement from a device application perspective .        </S>",
    "<S> we will examine how the tunneling current between a non - magnetic stm tip and surface varies as a function of the skyrmion s local atomic magnetization direction . </S>",
    "<S> considering the skyrmion s central spin - flipped atom , its local magnetic environment is inequivalent from those atoms in the ferromagnetic background . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one could expect already a conductance anisotropy in the center of the skyrmion due to the change in the electronic structure relative to the ferromagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> one purpose of our work here is to investigate this effect . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the heavy - metal substrate induces a large spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , coupling the local magnetization to the real - space direction , further modifying the electronic structure as a function of magnetization rotation relative to the substrate plane . </S>",
    "<S> this tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance ( tamr)@xmath23 effect has been studied in detail but typically for homogeneous magnetic domains ( either different ferromagnetic domains@xmath24 or homogeneous spin - spirals@xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we seek to extend this theoretical basis to inhomogeneous spin - textures such as skyrmions . </S>",
    "<S> we focus specifically on _ single _ skyrmions and do not investigate networks or lattices of skyrmions .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we explain the combined ( non - collinear and soi - induced ) spin - mixing magnetoresistance in terms of fully self - consistent calculations from first - principles , where we have direct access to the electronic structure of not just the magnetic heterostructure , but even of the states decaying into the vacuum , which are essential to the tunneling conductance . we find a rather large atomistic conductance anisotropy of up to @xmath020% ( @xmath010% ) for magnetic skyrmions in pd / fe / ir ( pd / pd / fe / ir ) magnetic thin - films , which potentially could be detected in a cpp - device geometry </S>",
    "<S> . establishing the physics of this generalized tunneling spin - mixing magnetoresistance ( txmr ) could possibly inspire the design of future nano - magnetic devices based on such a mechanism . </S>"
