    "we focus on the charge dynamics of a quantum dot ( or a localized region of a mesoscopic scatterer in more general terms ) as measured by a nearby qpc detector and determine the time evolution of the average charge and the charge - charge correlator for different strengths of the system  detector coupling .",
    "thereby we keep in mind a measurement with single - particle wave packets@xcite incident on the detector at times @xmath0 and @xmath1 with their reflection / transmission through the qpc providing information on the charge state of the quantum dot at the two time instances .",
    "our analysis provides us with two central results : on a technical level , we find that the strong projective measurement can be expressed through a projected charge @xmath2 , the charge at time @xmath3 after a previous projection at time @xmath4 , for which we find a compact expression in terms of the system s scattering matrix . on a physical level , we find that , in spite of the strongly different back - action induced by the first measurement , the two correlators for weak and strong measurements come out qualitatively similar , although quantitative differences remain , of course ; the latter are specifically discussed for the single - resonance level model .",
    "furthermore , we attempt to model the case of a finite constant voltage @xmath5 applied to the qpc detector by considering a sequence of wave packets incident on the qpc , leading to repeated projections which we describe via the projection postulate . increasing the rate of projections , we identify a transition from a regime where the dynamics of the system is dominated by the system s characteristics to a regime where the dynamics is universal and uniquely determined by the measurement .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
