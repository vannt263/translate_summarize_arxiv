    "recently , many theoretical and experimental investigations show that the control of phase coherence in multilevel atomic ensembles will give rise to many novel and striking quantum optical phenomena , such as the coherent population trapping@xcite , laser without inversion and electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit)@xcite , in the wave propagation of near - resonant light . according to the theoretical analysis of multilevel atomic phase coherence ,",
    "the requirement of the occurrence of eit is such that the strength of coupling light is much stronger than that of probe light@xcite . under this condition ,",
    "the eit atomic vapor allows the probe light to propagate without dissipation through the medium .",
    "due to its unusual quantum coherent character , the discovery of eit has so far led to many new peculiar effects and phenomena@xcite , some of which are believed to be useful for the development of new techniques in quantum optics .",
    "more recently , the physical effects associated with eit observed experimentally include the ultraslow light pulse propagation@xcite and light storage@xcite in atomic vapor , and atomic ground state cooling@xcite .    with the development of the quantum information ( quantum computation , quantum communication and quantum measurement ) ,",
    "the search for new ways to manipulate photon states becomes increasingly important@xcite . in the area of eit , historically , such a possibility might first be considered by ling _",
    "et al . _ , who investigated the `` electromagnetically induced grating '' in homogeneously broadened media@xcite . in this work there is a strong coupling standing wave , interacting with three - level lambda - type ( or cascade - type ) atoms .",
    "this can diffract a weak probe field , which propagates along a direction normal to the standing wave , into high - order diffractions . as stated by arve _",
    "et al_. , many researches of eit including the freezing light pulses@xcite , time - dependent group velocity@xcite , delayed probe light@xcite , stopping a pulse and restarting it in the opposite direction ( creating a time reversed version of the original probe pulse)@xcite have been limited to electromagnetic propagation in one dimension only@xcite , namely , the investigators of these studies did not consider how to change the direction of the probe light .",
    "for this reason , arve _",
    "et al_. lifted the restriction to the one dimension and considered the maxwell - bloch dynamics in two or more dimensions of three - level eit system , by using the adiabatic approximation and the slowly varying envelope approximation . in their treatment , however , they did not take into account the decay terms in the dynamical equations .",
    "since in a typical eit experiment@xcite , the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state of the three - level systems may be of the same order of magnitude as that of the rabi frequencies of the probe and coupling optical fields , the contribution of the decay terms in the maxwell - bloch dynamics should also be taken into consideration . in the present paper",
    ", we obtain the adiabatic solutions of the maxwell - bloch equations , _",
    "i.e. _ , the expressions for the time evolution of both the probe light and the off - diagonal density matrix elements of the atomic system . the formulation presented here can apply to the study of the variation of the propagation direction ( diffraction ) of the optical fields in the eit medium .",
    "consider a three - level @xmath0-type atomic ensemble interacting with two resonant laser beams , the rabi frequencies of which are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . in such a @xmath0-type atomic system , levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the ground states , and @xmath5 the excited state .",
    "the laser beam which couples levels @xmath5 and @xmath4 is called the probe light ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "another laser beam is termed the coupling light ( @xmath1 ) , which couples levels @xmath5 and @xmath3 . the schematic diagram for the above @xmath0-type system",
    "is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "if we apply the adiabatic approximation ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 ) to the three - level system , then the bloch equation can be rewritten in the form @xmath7-\\gamma_{ab}\\rho_{ab } ,     \\\\ & 0=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\omega_{\\rm p}\\rho_{bc}+\\omega_{\\rm c}\\left(\\rho_{cc}-\\rho_{aa}\\right)\\right]-\\gamma_{ac}\\rho_{ac } ,      \\\\ & \\dot{\\rho}_{bb}={\\rm im}\\left(\\omega_{\\rm p}\\rho_{ba}\\right)-\\gamma_{bb}\\rho_{bb } ,        \\\\ & \\dot{\\rho}_{bc}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\omega^{\\ast}_{\\rm p}\\rho_{ac}-\\omega_{\\rm c}\\rho_{ba}\\right)-\\gamma_{bc}\\rho_{bc } ,     \\\\ & 0={\\rm im}\\left(\\omega_{\\rm c}\\rho_{ca}\\right)-\\gamma_{cc}\\rho_{cc } , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "in order to let level @xmath4 into a dark state ( trapped state ) and thus realize the transparency effect for the probe light , the magnitude of rabi frequency @xmath8 should be much greater than @xmath9 in the first equation in ( [ eq1 ] ) can be ignored compared with the term @xmath10 .",
    "it follows from the first and last equations in ( [ eq1 ] ) that the relation @xmath11 can be satisfied , and consequently the ratio @xmath12 is obtained .",
