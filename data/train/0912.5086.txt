    "the evidence for solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations [ 1 - 5 ] implies that neutrinos have non - vanishing masses , and that neutrino flavour eigenstates are superpositions of mass eigenstates .",

    "@xmath7 s / ev @xcite were obtained .",
    "direct searches for radiative ( anti)-neutrino decays were performed in the vicinity of nuclear reactors ( e.g. @xcite , yielding limits between @xmath8 s / ev and @xmath9 s / ev , for @xmath10 between @xmath11 and 0.1 ) ; the borexino counting test facility at gran sasso yielded limits at the level of @xmath12 s / ev @xcite .",
    "cowsik @xcite pointed out that astronomical observations at x - ray , optical and radio - frequencies could be used to derive bounds on radiative lifetimes on the basis of the non - observation of the final @xmath13-ray .",
    "more recently bounds have been deduced from infra - red background measurements .",
    "such lower limits are large ( e.g. @xmath14 s / ev @xcite ) , but they are indirect and rather speculative .    the sun is a strong source of @xmath15 neutrinos ; the expected flux at the earth ( neglecting oscillation effects ) is @xmath16 @xmath17s@xmath18 . if radiative neutrino decays occur yielding visible photons , they would not be observable due to the very large amount of solar light . during a total solar eclipse ( tse )",
    "the moon screens the direct light from the sun , while it is completely transparent to solar neutrinos .",
    "an experiment looking for such an effect would thus be sensitive to neutrino decays occurring between the moon and the earth .    in a pioneering experiment performed in occasion of the october 24 , 1995 tse ,",
    "a first search was made for visible photons emitted through radiative decays of solar neutrinos during their flight between the moon and the earth @xcite .",
    "the authors assumed that all neutrinos have masses of the order of few ev , @xmath19 ev@xmath20 , an energy of 860 kev and that all decays yield visible photons , which travel nearly in the same direction as the parent neutrinos . from the absence of a positive signal they estimated a lower limit on @xmath4 ( 97 s ) which , in view of the assumptions made , is now not reliable .",
    "we made a search for solar neutrino radiative decays during the june 21 , 2002 tse , in zambia @xcite after a first attempt during the 1999 eclipse in romania @xcite .",

    "the original findscope was substituted by the digital videocamera used for data taking during the 2002 tse .",
    "the night before the eclipse we aligned the system , adjusted the focus and took calibration images of some standard luminosity stars ( sao99215 and sao99802 ) . in order to avoid the over - heating of the telescope and ccd and to minimize the possibility of focus and alignment changes , the equipment was protected with aluminum foils",

    "pictures of our set ups as well as data evaluation may be found in ref .",

    "+    the telescope movement was set to follow the sun in order to have always the center of the acquired images coincident with the sun center .",
    "furthermore , we implemented a special ccd exposure algorithm in order to adapt the exposure times to the luminosity level of the moon image .",
    "the ashen light ( the sun s light reflected by the earth back to the moon ) is one of the main background sources in such searches , but it allows the reconstruction , frame by frame , of the real position of the sun behind the moon , eliminating the risk of pointing errors due to undesired movements of the telescope .",
    "the digital video - camera used in occasion of the 2002 tse was a small backup system .",
    "it produced a digital film of the eclipse that could confirm our earlier results @xcite .",
    "a smaller celestron c5 telescope equipped with a manually controlled digital camera ( canon d20 ) was also used .",
    "we obtained 50 digital pictures of the eclipse .    in this paper",
    "we discuss only the data collected with the main system , which has a much higher sensitivity than the back - up systems .",
    "on the @xmath27 of march 2006 we observed the total solar eclipse from a location ( @xmath28 east longitude , @xmath29 north latitude and 465 m altitude ) in the libyan sahara desert , practically on the totality line and very close to the maximum eclipse point .",
    "the time of the totality was close to noon , so the sun and the moon were near their highest positions in the sky ( about @xmath30 ) , corresponding to the minimum light absorption by the atmosphere .    the data collected by the main system consist in 212 digital pictures of the central part of the  dark \" disk of the moon .",

    "[ ana ] is based on the wavelet decomposition of the images ; we selected only the central largest dyadic square from each frame ( @xmath33 square pixels ) ; the total coverage was @xmath34 ( the moon apparent diameter is @xmath35 ) .",

    "[ truc ] the image of the moon observed in the light of the sun is compared with one of our frames ( in ashen light ) .",
    "the corresponding area on the moon is marked by a rectangle .",
    "differences are due to the different moon lighting conditions ; some small scale details can be located in both images .",
    "+    dark ccd frames , used to eliminate the effect of some possible  hot pixels \" , were recorded before and after the totality phase .",
    "the telescope was aligned the night before the eclipse using the north star ( in the same observation session in which the calibration pictures were taken ) , and it was kept in position till the end of the eclipse .",
    "we continuously checked the sun position , starting at the moment of the first contact , using a grid applied on the screen of the digital videocamera .",
    "we used 7 luminous spots on the frames ( small moon craters reflecting the ashen light ) as  fiducial \" points to reconstruct for each frame the relative position of the center of the sun . although the telescope movement was set to follow the sun , the human activity around our apparatus caused some ground oscillations that were corrected using the fiducial points . for the analysis we retained 195 frames in which all 7 points were clearly determined .",

    "[ figmap]b the variation of the  x \" coordinate with time is shown .",
    "the origin of the time axis is at 12 hours and 13 minutes local time , about 50 seconds before the second contact of the eclipse .",

    "+    the superposition of the selected 195 frames is shown in fig .",
    "all lunar landscape details are washed away ; the light gradient is due mostly to the asymmetry of the coronal light diffracted by the moon border and reaching the instrument .",
    "the small darker spot visible in the picture ( at the center of the image , @xmath361.5 cm to the left ) is due to a sand grain on the telescope window .",
    "the procedure applied to eliminate all spurious effects on the image is discussed in sect .",
    "[ ana ] .     +      the exposure time for each frame was computed to have the maximum contrast avoiding at the same time saturated pixels .",
    "the algorithm analyzed the previous frame , and computed the exposure time for the next one so that the average luminosity was in the middle of the dynamical range of the 16 bit ccd . the exposure time and other information concerning the telescope movement",
    "were registered in the headers of each frame .     +    for most frames the exposure time was @xmath37 seconds , as expected .",
    "40 frames had a longer exposure , @xmath361 s ; each of them was acquired immediately after a frame having a normal exposure time , but with a luminosity about one half of the expected one .",
    "this was probably caused by a delay in the electromechanical ccd shutter operation due to some grains of dust that made their way into the apparatus .",
    "the exposure times were corrected in the analysis requiring that the acquisition rate be the average between the acquisition rates of two adjacent frames .",
    "[ corect ] shows the time dependence of the frames exposure rate in acquisition digital units ( adu ) per second .",
    "larger rates at the beginning and at the end of the totality phase are due to a larger amount of coronal light diffracted by the moon and reaching the telescope .",
    "the oscillations close to the eclipse maximum correspond to frames for which not all the 7 fiducial points could be clearly identified ( this was due to people moving around the experiment ) .",
    "these frames were excluded from the final analysis . after the time correction and the removal of  shaken \" frames , the total exposure time during",
    "the totality phase of the eclipse is about 116 seconds .",
    "the difference between this value and the duration of the totality is mainly due to the time requested to read the ccd information and transfer it to the computer .      as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ main ] , the calibration of the main system was done the night before the eclipse using two standard luminosity stars , sao99215 and sao99802 .",
    "we took 20 frames , 2 s exposure each , for the first star and 30 frames with the same exposure for the second star ( which is slightly fainter ) .",
    "after the removal of the dark frames the astro - photometric measurements indicate that one adu corresponds to @xmath38 photons .",
    "the analysis of the data obtained by this experiment required a detailed monte carlo simulation , including the neutrino production in the solar core , its propagation , decay , and the detection by our telescope on earth .",
    "such a code was developed for the analysis of the previous data collected during the 2001 eclipse @xcite and was adapted to the conditions of the 2006 observations .",

    "solar neutrino production was simulated according to the  bp2000 \" standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite available in numerical form in ref .",
    "we chose a specific reaction / decay yielding neutrinos ( both from the p - p and the cno cycles ) ; the neutrino energy and the position of its production point in the core of the sun were generated according to the ssm .",
    "as we are interested only in neutrinos that could undergo radiative decays between the area of the moon seen by our experiment and the earth , a decay point was generated and the arrival direction of the decay photon was chosen .",
    "once the geometry of the event is known , the photon energy is computed taking into account the lorentz boost , and for visible photons the probability density of the angular distribution , depending on whether the neutrino is a dirac neutrino , left or right - handed , or a majorana neutrino .",
