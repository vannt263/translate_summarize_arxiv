    "there are two models that describe star formation in spiral galaxies .",
    "the first of these in the large scale shock scenario ( e.g. roberts 1969 ) in which stars are formed when gas is compressed by shocks caused by density waves in spiral arms .",
    "the response of the gas to the shock can be non - linear if the relative motion is supersonic .",
    "the alternative is stochastic self propagating star formation ( e.g. seiden & gerola 1982 ) in which stars form randomly , e.g. when gas clouds compressed by shocks from supernovae .",
    "density waves are still used in this model to concentrate the star formation in spiral arms . in this paper",
    "we test these models using a sample of 20 galaxies and methods described below .",
    "20 spiral galaxies were observed in the k - band with ircam3 on ukirt and in h@xmath0 with the ccd camera on the jkt .",
    "detected h@xmath0 fluxes were converted to intrinsic luminosities using a distance calculated from the heliocentric recession velocity and @xmath2kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 .",
    "star formation rates were derived from the h@xmath0 luminosities using the empirical correlation of kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "we tested to see whether the properties of the spiral arms , as measured in the near - ir ( seigar & james 1998 ) , have any impact on the total rate of disk star formation , as traced by h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we find no significant correlations between disk h@xmath0 luminosity and arm strength , parametrized by a seeing - independent ` equivalent angle ' ( ea ) ( seigar & james 1998 ) .",
    "dividing ea by the fwhm of arm cross - section gives a measure of arm contrast , which plausibly determines the strength of shocks induced in the inter - stellar gas by the spiral arm .",
    "no correlation was found with with disk h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "we then found that h@xmath0 surface brightness anticorrelates with arm ea and arm contrast .",
    "thus , strong spiral arms do not lead to more intense star formation in these galaxies .",
    "this is in agreement with elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1986 ) , who found no difference in overall star formation rates in galaxies with and without strong spiral structure .",
    "however , arms may have a local effect on star formation rate within the disks of individual galaxies , although other factors may dominate differences in star formation rate between galaxies .",
    "we thus came up with a test , based on a technique used to measure star - formation efficiency ( knapen et al .",
    "1996 ) , to identify arm - induced star formation in these galaxies . for galaxies with well - defined spiral arms in their k - band images , we rebinned the k images to the same pixel scale as the h@xmath0 images , and overlaid them , using stellar centroids as references .",
    "a polygon lying around each k - band arm was defined .",
    "regions were also fitted by eye to define the disk , excluding the central bulge .",
    "the counts within each of the arm regions , and the overall disk , were measured .",
    "these apertures were then imported into the h@xmath0 images and photometry was then obtained for the same regions .",
    "finally , the h@xmath0/k flux ratio was calculated for all of the areas .",
    "the test is to see whether this ratio is larger in the arms than for the disks , where the latter ratio is taken from the total disk minus the central region .",
    "if arms represent regions where all disk material is concentrated by an equal factor , then the h@xmath0/k ratio would be the same in arms as in the disk . however , in most cases , we found h@xmath0/k ratios to be significantly higher in the k - band arms than in the disks .",
    "37 arm regions were measured in 14 galaxies ; 27 of these arms had h@xmath0/k ratios greater than that of the disk of the same galaxy .",
    "we find that 13 of the 14 galaxies show a net enhancement in h@xmath0/k ratio in spiral arms .",
    "the mean ratio found for all galaxies shows that h@xmath0/k is 1.4@xmath40.1 times higher in the arms than in the corresponding disks .",
    "this represents a highly significant finding of triggered star formation within spiral arms .",
    "we have found an increase in h@xmath0 flux near k - band arms in this sample .",
    "if k - band arms are dominated by light from old stars , this can be interpreted as star formation triggered by a density wave .",
    "globally , no significant correlation was found between the properties of the old stellar disk and star formation rates .",
