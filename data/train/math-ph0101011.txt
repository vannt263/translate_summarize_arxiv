    "the _ single site potential _ @xmath2 is assumed to be real , supported in @xmath3 $ ] , locally in @xmath4 , and not identical to @xmath5 ( in @xmath4-sense ) .",
    "the _ coupling constants _",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , are independent , identically distributed bernoulli random variables , i.e.  they have distribution @xmath8 with supp@xmath9 .",
    "thus the random potential @xmath10 is in @xmath11 for all @xmath12 , which allows to associate a unique selfadjoint operator with @xmath13 that may equivalently be defined by form methods or in the sense of sturm - liouville theory .",
    "our interest in bernoulli - anderson models of this type arises from the fact that their spectral properties are not as well understood , by mathematically rigorous standards , as those of anderson models with continuous ( or absolutely continuous ) distribution @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , these discrete distributions are physically more relevant as they are modeling the charge numbers of nuclei .",
    "one of the central objects in the study of one dimensional random operators is the _",
    "lyapunov exponent_. to define it for our model , let @xmath14 be the transfer matrix of    @xmath15    from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , i.e.  for any solution of ( [ diffex ] ) one has    @xmath18    also , for @xmath19 let @xmath20 , and define the lyapunov exponent at @xmath21 by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes expectation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "existence of @xmath24 follows from the subadditive ergodic theorem , e.g.@xcite . since @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 , and it can also be seen that one gets the same @xmath24 if transfer matrices on the negative half line are used analogously in ( [ lyapunov ] ) .    for many applications",
    "it is crucial to know at which energies one has that @xmath27 , which corresponds to exponential growth ( or decay ) of the solutions to ( [ diffex ] ) .",
    "our main goal here is to show that under the above assumptions this holds for all but a discrete set @xmath28 of energies @xmath21 , and to explicitly describe @xmath28 in terms of the _ transmission _ and _ reflection coefficients _ for scattering at the single site potential @xmath2 . to define them ,",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the _ jost solution _ of    @xmath31    i.e.  the solution satisfying    @xmath32    since @xmath33 and @xmath34 are linearly independent solutions of @xmath35 , this defines @xmath36 and @xmath37 uniquely .",
    "they are related to the transmission and reflection coefficients used in physics by @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in particular , vanishing of @xmath40 is equivalent to vanishing of @xmath41 .",
    "for real @xmath42 we use constancy of the wronskian to get    @xmath43 .",
    "it can also be seen from ( [ jostsol ] ) that    @xmath44 since @xmath45 is a solution of ( [ singlesite ] ) , a linear differential equation which is analytic in @xmath42 , and satisfies the analytic initial condition @xmath46 , we see that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are entire in @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath36 and @xmath37 are analytic in @xmath49 with a possible pole at @xmath50 .",
    "neither @xmath36 nor @xmath37 vanish identically . for @xmath36",
    "this is a trivial consequence of ( [ wronsrel ] ) .",
    "for @xmath37 it follows from the fact that a compactly supported @xmath51 can not be _ reflectionless _",
    "( i.e.  a _ soliton _ ) , as follows from inverse scattering theory , e.g.  @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "thus the roots of @xmath36 and @xmath37 can not accumulate , neither at ( the pole ) @xmath5 nor away from @xmath5 .",
    "we are now ready to state our main result :    [ mainthm ] let @xmath52 , where the set of critical energies @xmath28 is given by @xmath53 then @xmath54 .",
    "note that the critical set @xmath28 is the union of the discrete set @xmath55 and all real numbers in @xmath56 ( this uses that for real @xmath42 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath28 is discrete",
    ".    our main tool for proving theorem  [ mainthm ] in section  [ proofsec ] will be frstenberg s theorem , which has been used extensively in proofs of positivity of @xmath59 for discrete one dimensional random operators , see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "sec.14a ) for a summary . for continuum models ,",
    "the use of frstenberg s theorem until recently seems to have been restricted to the special cases @xmath60}$ ] and @xmath61 , a @xmath62-point - interaction @xcite . the first to have used frstenberg s theorem systematically for continuum anderson models with general classes of single sites",
    "@xmath2 has been kostrykin and schrader @xcite .",
    "while they state their general results for absolutely continuous distribution @xmath8 , they point out that most of their ideas can also be applied to discrete distributions .",
    "our work here can be seen as an implementation of this fact with , as we feel , a minimal amount of technical effort .",
    "a nice feature of using frstenberg s theorem in the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] is that once we know that the theorem holds under the assumption that supp@xmath9 , then it is immediately clear that the theorem extends to the case where @xmath63 supp@xmath64 .",
    "in fact , for larger support the critical set @xmath28 should be smaller .",
    "kostrykin and schrader note in @xcite that @xmath28 should be empty if supp@xmath64 has at least one non - isolated point , but there does nt seem to be a proof of this yet . while theorem  [ mainthm ] does not state that @xmath65 for all @xmath66 ( which in fact is not generally true ) , we will demonstrate in section  [ critsec ] that for bernoulli - anderson models one can indeed find many critical energies with @xmath65 . in the discrete case",
    "this has already been observed for the so - called _ dimer model _ , see @xcite . in particular",
    ", section  [ critsec ] discusses the example @xmath67}$ ] , @xmath68 a constant , which leads to two different types of critical energies .",
    "they can be classified by the asymptotics of solutions of ( [ diffex ] ) . in some cases they are of plane wave type ,",
    "in particular bounded , while other critical energies lead to solutions which grow like @xmath69 , due to a connection with random walks .    in @xcite",
    "we use a result much like theorem  [ mainthm ] to prove exponential and dynamical localization for continuum bernoulli - anderson models , where in addition we build on ideas which were developed for discrete models in @xcite .",
    "discreteness of the critical set @xmath28 is crucial to this approach . in particular",
    ", it shows that the result found in theorem  [ mainthm ] is superior to the well known results of kotani theory which prove that @xmath27 for almost every @xmath21 in a class of models containing ours .",
    "the methods of @xcite also allow to extend theorem  [ mainthm ] to the case where the support of @xmath8 is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 are arbitrary real numbers .",
    "this requires considerably more technical effort , due to our use of scattering theory at a periodic background , and thereby somewhat obscures the rather simple ideas which we present here in section  [ proofsec ] .",
    "to prove positivity of @xmath59 , we need to understand properties of the transfer matrices .",
    "the transfer matrix from -1/2 to 1/2 of @xmath72 is the matrix , @xmath73 , for which @xmath74 for any solution @xmath75 of ( @xmath76 ) . by @xmath77",
    "we denote the corresponding transfer matrix of @xmath78 .",
    "set @xmath79 to be the closed subgroup of @xmath80 generated by @xmath77 and @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 be the projective space , i.e. the set of the directions in @xmath83 and @xmath84 be the direction of @xmath85 .",
    "note that @xmath80 acts on @xmath82 by @xmath86 .",
    "we say that @xmath87 is strongly irreducible if and only if there is no finite @xmath88-invariant set in @xmath82 .    in order to prove theorem  [ mainthm ] we will consider energies @xmath89 and @xmath90 separately .",
    "note that @xmath91 is contained in @xmath28 , so we do nt need to consider it .",
    "the general approach is as follows : we will first prove that @xmath92 is not compact by showing that a sequence of elements has unbounded norm .",
    "this argument will be valid for all @xmath93 , where @xmath94 once non - compact , then the group @xmath88 is known to be strongly irreducible if and only if for each @xmath95 , @xmath96 see @xcite . in order to prove that this condition is also satisfied",
    "we will in addition have to exclude @xmath42 s which are odd multiples of @xmath97 .",
    "we then use frstenberg s theorem which states , in our context , that if the group @xmath98 is not compact and strongly irreducible then @xmath99 , see also @xcite .",
    "we start with positive energies , i.e.  @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and express the transfer matrices over @xmath3 $ ] in terms of the jost solutions ( [ jostsol ] ) , at @xmath102 .",
    "we have @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the solutions of ( [ singlesite ] ) satisfying @xmath106 @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "writing @xmath104 and @xmath105 as linear combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath109 and setting @xmath110 , we see that @xmath111 & \\frac{1}{k } \\mbox{im}[z_+(k ) ] \\\\",
    "-k \\mbox{im}[z_-(k ) ] & \\mbox{re}[z_-(k ) ] \\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ]    clearly , @xmath112    note for @xmath101 , @xmath113 thus proving non - compactness for @xmath114 is equivalent to proving non - compactness for the group @xmath115 conjugate to @xmath114 via ( @xmath116 ) .    if @xmath117 we have that @xmath118 , and hence , we may write @xmath119 . by @xmath120 , one has then that @xmath121 which is a rotation .",
    "the same holds for @xmath122 by ( [ freetrans ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath115 is a group of rotations and thereby compact .",
    "this not only excludes an application of frstenberg , but shows @xmath123 as a direct consequence of the definition ( [ lyapunov ] ) .",
    "now assume @xmath124 .",
    "set @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and see that ( @xmath127 ) implies @xmath128 .",
    "it follows then that @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 . with this notation",
    ", one may recalculate @xmath132 where we have set @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we wish to show that a sequence of elements in @xmath115 has unbounded norm .",
    "to do so , consider an arbitrary unit vector @xmath135 the relation @xmath136 shows that the image of the unit circle under @xmath137 is an ellipse , with the choices @xmath138 and @xmath139 identifying the semi - major and semi - minor axes as follows : @xmath140 defining @xmath141 , a short calculation , using @xmath128 , yields @xmath142.\\ ] ] as a consequence , we see that @xmath143 is @xmath144-periodic and has exactly two roots in @xmath145 .",
    "in particular , @xmath146 if and only if @xmath147 , which shows that the distance between the zeros of @xmath143 is not equal to @xmath148 : recall @xmath149 ( and @xmath150 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath151 if and only if @xmath152 and hence @xmath153 . as a result , there exists a compact interval @xmath154 ( not necessarily in @xmath155 ) with @xmath156 and @xmath157 for all @xmath158",
    ".    now , applying @xmath137 once to @xmath159 , @xmath160 as above , produces a new vector with norm greater than one , but the direction , initially @xmath160 , is possibly altered .",
    "a vector with this new direction may not increase in norm by directly applying @xmath137 again .",
    "however , as long as @xmath42 is not an integer multiple of @xmath144 , then finitely many applications of @xmath161 , which is rotation by @xmath42 , produces a vector with direction in @xmath154 . once in @xmath154 , a direct application of @xmath137 does increase the norm size uniformly by @xmath162 , as indicated above . in this manner",
    ", we can produce a sequence of elements in @xmath115 with unbounded norm .",
    "thus @xmath115 is non - compact if @xmath124 and @xmath42 is not an integer multiple of @xmath144 .    to complete the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] for positive energies",
    ", we note that if in addition @xmath42 is not an integer multiple of @xmath97 , then the free transfer matrix produces three distinct elements in projective space , i.e.  ( [ 3dir ] ) is satisfied and frstenberg s theorem implies @xmath163 .",
    "we finally turn to energies @xmath90 . in this case @xmath164",
    "is non - compact for every @xmath165 , since the free transfer matrix @xmath166 has unbounded powers , where @xmath167 .",
    "it remains to check ( @xmath168 ) , which we have to do for @xmath169 .",
    "let @xmath170 such that @xmath171 and @xmath172 . by ( @xmath173 )",
    ", this is equivalent to @xmath174 where @xmath175 are the directions of @xmath176 . if @xmath177 , then @xmath178 . if , on the other hand , @xmath179 , then we use ( @xmath180 ) to conclude that an initial application of @xmath181 followed by iteration of @xmath182 gives an infinite orbit .",
    "this shows ( @xmath168 ) and completes the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the appearance of critical energies in concrete examples .",
    "we thereby illustrate the following points : ( i ) critical energies with vanishing lyapunov exponent do indeed exist , ( ii ) the structure and `` size '' of the set of energies with @xmath117 depends strongly on the concrete example , and ( iii ) at critical energies at least two different types of non - exponential asymptotics of solutions can be observed .",
    "our first general observation is that if @xmath183 is the schrdinger operator with @xmath184-periodic potential @xmath185 satisfying @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath183 has a degenerate gap at energy @xmath188 , i.e.  either all solutions of ( [ singlesite ] ) satisfy periodic boundary conditions on @xmath3 $ ] or all solutions satisfy anti - periodic boundary conditions on @xmath3 $ ] , then @xmath189 or @xmath190 . by ( [ teqn ] )",
    "this implies @xmath191 or @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "conversely , @xmath193 necessarily requires a degenerate gap .",
    "thus , the possibility of degenerate gaps in periodic potentials is one mechanism which leads to reflectionless energies . whether all reflectionless energies arise in this way is equivalent to deciding if @xmath117 necessarily leads to @xmath194 . in example 2 below we will see that this is not the case .",
    "* type 1a : * @xmath200 such that @xmath117 : this happens for @xmath201 , @xmath19 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath202 , and it easily follows that the group @xmath203 is bounded .",
    "this means that solutions to ( [ diffex ] ) are bounded and that @xmath123 .",
    "* type 1b : * @xmath204 , @xmath205 : this means @xmath206 , and again @xmath207 bounded , @xmath123 .",
    "this type is `` dual '' to type 1 , since @xmath208 can be viewed as the energies where @xmath209}$ ] is reflectionless with respect to @xmath210 .    *",
    "type 2 : * @xmath100 , where @xmath211 , @xmath212 .",
    "this leads to a critical energy with a rather different asymptotic behavior of solutions if also @xmath213 , @xmath214 , that is , for specific values of @xmath215 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath216 let @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the transfer matrix of @xmath13 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath219    if @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the diagonal entries of @xmath222 , then the sums of @xmath223 , @xmath224 , give a symmetric random walk ( observing that @xmath225 ) .",
    "thus it follows that for every @xmath226 and almost surely @xmath227 and @xmath228 see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this is that the hull of the ( oscillatory ) solutions of ( [ diffex ] ) asymptotically grows like @xmath229 or decays like @xmath230 for some @xmath231 , where a generalization of the ruelle - osceledec theorem from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) is used .      consider @xmath232 } - \\chi_{(0,1/2]})$ ] with @xmath233 . for @xmath234",
    ", we may again explicitly calculate the transfer matrix @xmath235 and see that , @xmath236 for @xmath237 . from this and the boundary conditions of the jost solution ,",
    "i.e. @xmath238 one can show that @xmath239    therefore , if we fix some @xmath240 , then any @xmath241 for which @xmath242 must satisfy @xmath243 for some @xmath244 . thus @xmath245 must have the form @xmath246 and the corresponding reflectionless @xmath21 s are then @xmath247    from this",
    "we conclude that for most values of @xmath245 ( e.g. , lebesgue almost every @xmath245 ) , no reflectionless energy exists above @xmath245 . on the other hand ,",
    "every @xmath245 satisfying has only finitely many reflectionless energies .",
    "in fact , if @xmath248 , then @xmath249 for only finitely many pairs",
    "but this finite number can be arbitrarily large , depending on @xmath245 : to find at least @xmath251 exceptional energies , choose @xmath252 and see that for @xmath253 one may choose @xmath254 and @xmath255 satisfying @xmath256 .",
    "proof : take @xmath257 and @xmath258 and see that @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , @xmath260    recall from our remarks in [ nogap ] that in some cases , the condition @xmath117 implies that @xmath261 . to see that this is not always the case",
