    "the vista near - infrared @xmath5 survey of the magellanic system ( vmc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an eso public survey that is obtaining deep near infrared imaging in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath0 filters of a wide area across the magellanic system , using the vircam camera @xcite of the eso vista telescope @xcite .",
    "+ the main science goals of the survey are the determination of the spatially - resolved star - formation history ( sfh ) and the definition of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure of the whole magellanic system .",
    "the vmc observations are devised to reach @xmath8 mag , thus allowing us to measure sources encompassing most phases of stellar evolution : from the main - sequence , to subgiants , upper and lower red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , red clump stars , rr lyrae and cepheid variables , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , post - agb stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , etc .",
    "these different stellar populations will help us assessing the evolution of age and metallicity within the whole mc system .",
    "+ in this context , a very significant role is played by the radially pulsating variables , since these stars obey a period - mean density relation that forms the basis of their use as standard candles to measure the distance to the host system .",
    "the rr lyrae stars in particular , in the @xmath1 band obey a period - luminosity - metallicity ( @xmath9 ) relation which is weakly affected by the evolutionary effects , the spread in stellar mass within the instability strip , and uncertainties in the reddening corrections ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the cepheid @xmath10 relation in the @xmath1 band is much narrower than the corresponding optical relations , and less affected by systematic uncertainties in the reddening and metal content ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we present preliminary results for the rr lyrae stars and cepheids contained in the first two `` tiles '' completely observed by the vmc survey , namely tiles 8_8 and 6_6 .",
    "these two tiles are centered respectively on the south ecliptic pole ( sep ) field and on the well known 30 doradus ( 30 dor ) star forming region of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the sep field is particularly interesting because this region of the sky will be continuously and repeatedly observed during the the commissioning phase of the astrometric gaia satellite just after the launch in spring 2013 .",
    "the vmc observing strategy is described in detail in @xcite to which the interested reader is referred for more information . here",
    "we focus on the data acquisition for the variable stars .    in order to obtain",
    "well sampled light curves and measure accurate parameters ( namely @xmath0 average magnitudes ) for the variable sources , the @xmath0 observations were split into 12 epochs and distributed along several consecutive months .",
    "+ we used the v1.0 vmc release `` pawprints '' ( 6 `` pawprints '' form a `` tile '' ) .",
    "the pawprints were processed by the pipeline @xcite of the vista data flow system ( vdfs , * ? ? ? * ) and retrieved from the vista science archive ( vsa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . + usually a variable star is present in two or three not necessarily consecutive pawprints .",
    "hence we first calculated a weighted average of the pawprints @xmath0 magnitudes to obtain the `` tile '' @xmath0 , which also represents one epoch of data .",
    "-band light curves of three fundamental mode ( f ; 3 upper panels ) and one first overtone ( fo ; bottom panel ) rr lyrae stars in the sep field .",
    "internal photometric errors of the individual data points are shown , they are typically in the range of 0.02 to 0.05 mag",
    ". periods were taken form the eros-2 survey . ]",
    "-band light curve for a sample of cepheids in the sep field .",
    "note in the third panel the nice light curve for a faint fo cepheid .",
    "periods were taken form the eros-2 survey . ]",
    "particular care was devoted to the determination of a proper heliocentric julian day ( hjd ) for the @xmath0 value of each `` tile '' .",
    "the identification , pulsation period and epoch of maximum light of the rr lyrae stars and cepheids contained in the sep and 30 dor regions are already available in the photometric archives of the microlensing surveys ogle and eros-2 .     for rr lyrae stars in the 30 dor region .",
    "periods were taken form the ogle - iii survey . ]    the ogle surveys ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) of which stage iv is in progress , cover an area of the mc system that extends progressively further outside from the bar of each of the clouds .",
    "eros-2 @xcite is , at present ,",
    "the most extended of the two surveys and is the only one covering the largest fraction of the vmc field of view including the most peripheral areas such as the sep region , that in fact only overlaps with eros-2 .",
    "coordinates , periods and optical channel ( 420 - 720 nm ) , overlaps with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 standard bands , and the @xmath13 channel ( 620 - 920 nm ) roughly matches the mean wavelength of the cousins @xmath14 band @xcite ] light - curves of the rr lyrae and cepheids in the gaia sep field were taken from the eros-2 catalogue and cross - matched to the vmc catalogues for the sep tile .",
    "the 30 dor field is covered by both eros-2 and ogle - iii , but for the present analysis we only employed the periods and optical ( johnson - cousins @xmath15 bands ) light curves from ogle - iii @xcite . + as a result of the matching procedure we found 107 and 1465 rr lyrae variables , and 11 and 326 classical cepheids in the sep and 30 dor fields , respectively .",
    "but for cepheids in the 30 dor field . typical errors of the individual data points are of the order of 0.01 - 0.02 mag , hence have same size as the data points plotted in the figure .",
    "periods were taken from the ogle - iii survey . ]",
    "the periods available from eros-2 for the sep variables and from ogle - iii for the 30 dor variables were used to fold the @xmath0-band light curves produced by the vmc observations and derive average @xmath0 magnitudes for the variables .",
    "examples of the vmc @xmath0-band light curves of rr lyrae stars and cepheids in the sep and 30 dor regions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] , respectively .",
    "error bars of the individual @xmath0 measurements are shown in the figures .",
    "the uncertainties for the cepheids are of the same size at the data - points , while they are larger for the rr lyrae stars , particularly in the 30 dor region , due to the fainter magnitudes of these variables and the high crowding of the 30 dor field .      in the present work we confine our discussion to the rr lyrae stars in the sep field and the cepheids in the 30 dor region only .",
    "this is because of the small number of cepheids in the sep tile ( only 11 ) , and because the high photometric contamination at the magnitude level of the rr lyrae stars in the 30 dor field requires a more careful and detailed analysis which is still in progress .",
    "the @xmath0-band light curves of the rr lyrae stars are almost sinusoidal and the amplitude of the luminosity variation in @xmath0 is also rather modest . however , the most accurate results for the mean magnitudes are achieved by using the light - curve templates provided by @xcite .",
    "note that the use of templates requires accurate ephemeris and @xmath11-band amplitudes which , for the sep rr lyrae were calculated starting from the eros-2 database .    as for the cepheids , as shown by figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ,  [ fig4 ] , the light curves are well sampled and nicely shaped . hence , to derive the ( intensity ) average @xmath16 we simply used a custom program written in `` c '' language that performed a spline interpolation to the data .",
    "having derived the mean @xmath0 magnitudes as discussed above , we then computed the @xmath2 relations for the sep rr lyrae stars and the 30 dor classical cepheids .      the @xmath2 relation of the 95 rr lyrae stars with good photometry in the sep field is shown in fig .",
    "[ seprr ] , where the periods of the fo rr lyrae stars were fundamentalized using the formula logp@xmath17=logp@xmath18 + 0.127 .",
    "the @xmath0 magnitudes were dereddened using the @xmath19 value for the sep field provided by s. rubele ( private communication ) and calculated as described in @xcite .",
    "+ we then performed a least - square fit to the data , obtaining the following @xmath2 relation :    @xmath20    which has an r.m.s.=0.082 mag .",
    "the higher dispersion of the sep rr lyrae @xmath2 with respect to the @xmath2 relations followed by the rr lyrae in galactic globular clusters ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is likely due to a spread in distance among the sep rr lyrae along the line of sight , as well as to the possible presence of a metallicity variance among the variables . we have compared our results for the sep rr lyrae stars with previous near - infrared observations of rr lyrae variables in the lmc by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ eq1 ] can be compared with eq .",
    "7 of @xcite which was calculated using rr lyrae data from both the above mentioned papers ( 107 stars in total ) :    @xmath21    the two equations are only marginally consistent within the errors , and the @xcite @xmath2 has a larger dispersion than ours .",
    "these occurrences can be due to both geometrical ( depth ) effects and a metallicity spread .",

    "[ figdorcep ] . since the saturation level of the vmc survey in @xmath0 limits the length of the periods we are able to measure to a maximum value of about 15 - 20 days , we decided to complement our data with the sample by @xcite that includes 84 f - mode cepheids with periods mainly ranging between 10 and 100 days . to merge",

    ", we adopted the recent evaluations by @xcite , while for the @xcite data set we adopted the values provided by the authors .",

    "the same table also shows a comparison with the literature results of @xcite , who only published the @xmath2 relation of fundamental - mode pulsators , and of @xcite who also gives the fo @xmath2 relation .",
    "an inspection of the table reveals that 1 ) for the f - mode pulsators there is general agreement within the errors among the three studies ; 2 ) the present relation has smaller errors of the coefficients of the @xmath2 equation because of the wide range of periods spanned by the cepheids used to derive the relation , including for the first time in the near - infrared range a significant number of objects with periods smaller than 5 days ; 3 ) for the fo pulsators the agreement with @xcite is not as good as for the f - mode cepheids .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the deeper photometry of the vmc survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* relies on 2mass and denis data ) allowed us to reach the fainter fo - cepheids that populate the low - period tail of the @xmath2 relation .",
