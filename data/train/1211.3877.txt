    "<S> introduction. _ genuine multisite entanglement is an important resource in quantum information protocols and is known to offer significant advantage in quantum tasks in comparison to bipartite entanglement @xcite . in particular , it is the basic ingredient in measurement - based quantum computation @xcite , and is beneficial in various quantum communication protocols @xcite , including secret sharing @xcite ( cf.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the conventional information tasks , the study of multisite entanglement turns out to be important in understanding many - body phenomena such as quantum phase transitions @xcite and to understand transport properties in the evolution of photosynthetic complexes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although bipartite entanglement in the case of two spin-1/2 particles is rather well - understood , the situation is quite different in the case of classification and quantification of entanglement in higher dimensions as well as in multiparty systems . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that many - particle systems can have different types of useful entanglement , depending on the particular information processing protocols under study , makes the quantification a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> while there are several characterizations of multiparty entanglement measures known in the literature @xcite , it is in general difficult to compute them for large systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , for pure multisite states , it is possible to use the _ generalized geometric measure _ @xcite , which is a computable geometric measure of genuine multisite entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic spin-1/2 lattice states , with short - range dimer coverings are possible ground states of quantum spin liquids , known as resonating valence bond ( rvb ) states @xcite , and are of considerable interest in high - temperature superconductivity @xcite , cooperative phenomena in many body systems @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these short - range dimer states can be efficiently simulated in laboratories using atoms in optical lattices @xcite or in cavities using interacting photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large number of superpositions of the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) dimer coverings even in moderately large two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices , makes the characterization and computation of both bipartite and multisite entanglement of such spin states an arduous task .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider quantum states , with dimer coverings , of an isotropic spin-1/2 lattice . </S>",

    "<S> examples of genuinely multisite entangled states include the greenberger - horne - zeilinger @xcite and w @xcite states . </S>",
    "<S> there also exist large superpositions of quantum spin-1/2 dimer states that are not genuinely multisite entangled @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the following theorem shows that the state in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rvb ] ) is genuinely multisite entangled . </S>",
    "<S> * theorem : * _ the pure state formed by superpositions of dimer coverings is genuinely multisite entangled for all isotropic spin-1/2 lattices of arbitrary dimensions that are periodic or infinite in all directions and all covering functions that are isotropic over the lattice . _    ` proof . ` </S>",
    "<S> the superposition state of the spin-1/2 lattice consisting of @xmath5 particles , in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rvb ] ) , is a pure state . to prove that this superposed state is genuinely multisite entangled , we are required to prove that the partial density matrix of the state across any bipartition can not be pure . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the density matrix of any @xmath6 spins , formed by tracing the remaining @xmath7 spins , is always mixed and , hence entangled to the rest . </S>",
    "<S> we conveniently divide the proof into the two cases where the number of spins ( a ) is finite in at least one part of the bipartition and ( b ) is infinite in both the parts . _ </S>",
    "<S> a ) finite case : _ for a rotationally invariant state , such as the dimer - covered spin-1/2 state under consideration , it is known that the partial density matrix of an arbitrary number of spins is also rotationally invariant . moreover , for an odd number of spin-1/2 particles , there is no pure quantum state that is rotationally invariant . </S>",
    "<S> hence any odd bipartition of the system is always entangled to the rest of the system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , any single - site density matrix is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the @xmath10 identity matrix , and therefore is maximally entangled to the rest of the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the case of a bipartition with an even ( finite ) number of spins in one part . consider any set @xmath11 of an even number of sites . </S>",
    "<S> let the partial density matrix of these sites in @xmath11 , corresponding to the state @xmath12 , be @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that @xmath13 is pure , which would imply that @xmath12 is separable , contrary to the statement of the theorem . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath14 , where @xmath15 contains an arbitrary but fixed odd number of sites @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath17 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath18 . ) in particular , @xmath19 can be unity . for an isotropic lattice </S>",
    "<S> , we can always find another equivalent set of spins , @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 , which is again pure ( by the assumption ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy @xcite implies @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the von neumann entropy of its argument . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath13 and @xmath24 are pure , and since von neumann entropy is non - negative , we have @xmath25 , which in turn implies that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are pure . </S>",
    "<S> this immediately implies that @xmath28 is pure . </S>",
    "<S> this is a contradiction as @xmath19 is odd . </S>",
    "<S> this part of the proof was partially presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ b ) infinite case : _ let us begin with the case of an infinite 2d square lattice partitioned into two half - planes by an infinite horizontal line . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the reduced states are pure , contrary to the statement of the theorem . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath29 denote the sites in one such half - plane . </S>",
    "<S> consider now the set @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the infinite horizontal strip of sites with single - site width and that is directly adjacent to @xmath29 . by isotropy , if @xmath32 is pure , @xmath33 is also pure . consequently , we can again use strong subadditivity to show that @xmath34 is pure . now if @xmath34 is pure , by isotropy , @xmath35 is also pure , where @xmath36 is the infinite vertical strip of sites with single - site width and that is obtained from @xmath31 by rotating it by @xmath37 radians around the site with cartesian coordinates @xmath38 . again using strong subadditivity , we find that @xmath39 is pure , which is a contradiction . a similar proof works for boundaries that are not straight lines .    one needs a separate proof for the case when we want to prove that the infinite horizontal strip @xmath40 having a width of @xmath41 sites is not a product with the remaining portion of the lattice . assume , if possible , that @xmath42 is pure . then , by isotropy , @xmath43 is also pure , where @xmath44 is obtained from @xmath40 by a @xmath37 rotation around @xmath38 . again applying strong subadditivity , we have that the reduced state of the @xmath45 spins in @xmath46 is pure , which is a contradiction ( by the ( a ) part of the proof ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar proofs are possible for other infinite strips . </S>",
    "<S> just like the proof of the ( a ) part , the ( b ) part also works , with suitable modifications , for arbitrary isotropic lattices of arbitrary dimensions , e.g. the triangular and hexagonal lattices in 2d and the cubic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47    _ quantifying multisite entanglement. _ the qualitative answer in the preceding section only indicates the nonvanishing quality of the multipartite entanglement content of the dimer - covering superposition on an arbitrary isotropic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> however , such an entanglement content can asymptotically graze to zero with increasing system size . </S>",
    "<S> below , we show that this is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we provide an analytical method to quantify genuine multipartite entanglement of such dimer - covered superposition states and then show that the state under consideration possesses a relatively high genuine multiparty entanglement for arbitrarily large system size . to quantify the genuine multisite entanglement in an isotropic spin-1/2 lattice , with dimer coverings , we use a form of a geometric measure , that can be conveniently computed , called the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite [ for details , see the supplemental material @xcite ] . the ggm ( @xmath48 ) is defined as @xmath49 where the maximization is performed over all possible @xmath50 values that are not genuinely multisite entangled . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of the ggm depends on the efficient generation of arbitrary reduced density matrices across all possible bipartitions of the spin system . </S>",
    "<S> certain properties such as two - point correlations , energy , and partition function , of such large superpositions , if found to be ground states of a hamiltonian , can be evaluated in some cases by using approximate methods such as mean field approximations and renormalization techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an iterative method , the _ density matrix recursion method _ </S>",
    "<S> ( dmrm ) for 2d square spin-1/2 lattices , with nn dimer coverings [ i.e. @xmath51 for nns , and vanishing otherwise ] , by which the limitations in computing all possible density matrices and the correlation properties of such lattice states can be overcome . </S>",
    "<S> the method proceeds by deriving an algebraic recursion relation between the quantum states of small - sized spin systems that can be exactly computed . </S>",
    "<S> we now apply the dmrm to two kinds of 2d systems : ( a ) the _ perfect _ square lattices with an equal even number of sites on the horizontal and vertical sides and ( b ) the _ imperfect _ square lattices having an even number of sites on the horizontal side but an odd number on the vertical one . note that the total number of spin sites is always even . the difference between the behavior of ggm for perfect and imperfect square lattices </S>",
    "<S> is significantly reduced as the lattice size is increased . _ </S>",
    "<S> _ perfect square lattice.__we consider a spin-1/2 square lattice with @xmath52 spins along the horizontal and @xmath53 spins in the vertical sides , such that @xmath54 ( = @xmath5 ) is the total number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> for a perfect lattice with even @xmath52 ( @xmath55 ) , the spin state of the system , which we rename as @xmath56 , can be generated by using a recursion of two smaller sized imperfect spin states @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
