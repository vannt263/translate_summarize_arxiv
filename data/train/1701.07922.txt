    "dissipation in quantum mechanics has , in recent times , attracted an increasing amount of interest .",
    "this is primarily due to its role in inducing decoherence in a quantum system which is coupled to an environment @xcite . in this context",
    ", dissipation can be viewed as a bane in quantum mechanics , and efforts have been made to reduce dissipative effects due to correlation between a quantum system and the surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "however , recent work has shown that dissipation can be used as a resource in quantum mechanics , wherein it drives the evolution of a quantum system towards a unique steady state @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if a system is coupled to an environment in the manner of an open quantum system , then with the proper choice of environment , and by adjusting the strength of coupling between the system and the environment , the resulting time evolution equation for the system will have a unique steady state .",
    "the existence of this unique steady state can then be attributed to dissipative effects due to the coupling between the system and the environment . as such , one",
    "can then use dissipation as a resource in quantum computation and quantum state preparation , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .    aside from quantum computation and quantum state preparation , dissipation can also be used as a resource in quantum state transport .",
    "an illustration of how this can be done was carried out by rebentrost et al @xcite , wherein they considered an interacting @xmath0-body system in the presence of a single excitation .",
    "they were able to show that by coupling this system with a fluctuating environment , the quantum transport of excited energy states can be enhanced , with the efficiency of the process dependent on the energy mismatch between states and the hopping terms in the system hamiltonian .",
    "this quantum transport scheme has been applied to the analysis of electronic energy transfer in photosynthetic structures @xcite , in non - markovian open quantum systems @xcite , as well as in the analysis of quantum transport in various systems @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism for efficient dissipation - assisted quantum transport was provided in refs .",
    "@xcite , which makes use of open quantum random walks . in this mechanism ,",
    "a system with internal and spatial degrees of freedom is coupled to an environment , with the coupling between the system and the environment causing the system to undergo a quantum random walk .",
    "open quantum random walks have been shown to obey a central limit theorem @xcite , which implies that quantum systems undergoing open quantum random walks will evolve towards a unique steady state .",
    "having shown that dissipation can be treated as a resource in quantum mechanics , and that it can be used to enhance and create efficient quantum transport mechanisms , we then ask if it is possible to create other dissipation induced quantum transport mechanisms . in this paper , we show that it is possible by considering a system comprised of a lattice of two - level systems coupled to an environment with a discrete number of energy levels .",
    "we show that if the system and the environment are weakly coupled to each other , it is possible to create an efficient dissipation induced quantum transport scheme for excited states of the system from one end of the lattice to the other .",
    "maximum efficiency can be achieved if the number of energy levels present in the environment is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the system s , if the spacing between energy levels of the system is relatively large and if the ground state energy of the environment is much less than that of the system s .",
    "the rest of the paper is divided into the following sections .",
    "section 2 gives a general description of the system and environment in terms of their respective hamiltonians , and specifies as well the form of the hamiltonian describing their interactions .",
    "section 3 outlines the derivation of the master equation describing the dynamics of the system , while section 4 provides a description of the dynamics of the system by examining the properties of the numerical solution of the master equation of the system .",
    "we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "the system @xmath1 considered in this paper consists of a one - dimensional lattice of two - level systems .",
    "the hilbert space corresponding to this system is given as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the subspaces of the system s hilbert space corresponding to the system s energy and position , respectively .",
    "in this hilbert space , the system s hamiltonian has the following form :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is a basis vector in @xmath4 corresponding to node @xmath7 in the lattice , which is finite , 1-dimensional and has a total of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "also , the operator @xmath8 is the annihilation operator defined in the hilbert space @xmath3 corresponding to the energy level @xmath9 for the system s internal degrees of freedom .",
    "let the system @xmath1 be coupled to an environment @xmath10 , which has a hamiltonian @xmath11 whose explicit form is defined in a hilbert space @xmath12 as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the annihilation operator , defined in @xmath12 , corresponding to the energy level @xmath15 of the environment @xmath10 .    to describe the interaction between the system and the environment",
    ", we assume that the coupling between the system and the environment is linear in system operators defined in @xmath16 and @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we let those system operators be @xmath17 and @xmath18 which are defined in @xmath16 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "then the interaction between the system and environment is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the coupling constant describing the strength of coupling between the system @xmath1 and the environment @xmath10 .",
    "we evolve the coupling hamiltonian over time , making use of the evolution equation    @xmath21    in doing so , we obtain the following expression :    @xmath22    from the form of @xmath23 , we can then see that the coupling between the system and the environment induces a form of quantum transport of excitations in the system from one lattice site to another , and in doing so either raises or lowers the energy of the environment .",
    "this quantum transport process of excitations can be described more explicitly using a quantum master equation for the system , which will be derived in the next section .",
    "allowing the system to interact with the environment means that it is now an open quantum system , whose dynamics are described by a master equation which specifies the time evolution of the density matrix describing the system .",
    "this master equation can be obtained by making use of the integral form of the von neumann master equation in the interaction picture , and by making use of the born approximation as well as the assumption that the initial state is a product state @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we will then obtain the redfield equation , whose general form is given by @xmath24\\right ] .",

    "we make use of the redfield equation rather than the born - markov equation to describe the dynamics of the open quantum system because we are interested in determining the dynamics of the system over intermediate timescales , rather than over long timescales .",
    "such timescales are more realistic and experimentally realizable , which implies that the resulting master equation will be of greater use in experimental investigations of the open quantum system . in deriving this equation",
    ", we make use of the born approximation , which states that the total density matrix of the system coupled to the environment has the form    @xmath26    where @xmath25 and @xmath27 are the density matrices , defined in the hilbert spaces @xmath3 and @xmath12 , respectively , describing the state of the internal degrees of freedom of the system and of the environment at node @xmath7 of the lattice and at the instant of time @xmath28 .    now for a system undergoing a quantum walk , the density matrix @xmath25 describing the system at time @xmath28 can be written as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 describes the state of the system at energy level @xmath31 and node @xmath7 in the lattice . inserting equations [ timeevohamtot ] and [ densmattime ] into equation [ redfieldgen ] ,",

    "however , the lindblad operator of the master equation , given by @xmath36 involves two internal states of the system , namely the internal state of the system at lattice site @xmath37 and the internal state of the system at lattice site @xmath7 .",
    "this , together with the time dependence of the coefficients @xmath34 of the lindblad operator , signifies that @xmath38 is not in lindblad form , which implies that the time evolution of the internal states of the system is non - markovian .",
    "we will explore the consequences of this non - markovian behavior of the system in the next section as we examine the dynamics of the system by numerically solving the master equation .",
    "having derived the master equation describing the dynamics of the system , we now solve it numerically to enable us to analyze the dynamical behavior of the system . in doing so",
    ", we will also be able to examine the quantum transport mechanism described by the system - environment interaction hamiltonian given in section 2 , and determine the efficiency of such a process . in our analysis , we make use of natural units .    for the initial state , we assume that it is localized at node @xmath39 , and is then given as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the density matrix describing the initial internal state of the system .",

    ", we assume that the initial internal state @xmath41 of the system localized at node @xmath39 is the ground energy state of the system . to analyze the dynamics of the system ,",
    "we then compute for the probability that a node @xmath6 is occupied at time @xmath28 as follows :    @xmath44    where the trace is taken over the internal state @xmath45 occupying node @xmath7 at time @xmath28 .    by computing the occupation probability @xmath46 for various nodes , we find that an optimal quantum transport scheme will result from the coupling of the two - level system to the environment if the spacing between energy levels in the system and the environment are large @xmath47 , if the number of energy levels in the environment is small , and if the ground state energy of the environment is much smaller than the ground state energy of the system @xmath48 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ occproballnodesalltimes ] , which is a plot of the occupation probability @xmath46 taken over all nodes at each time @xmath28 .",
    "the plot shows that initially , the state is localized at the origin , but as it evolves , the probability that it will be found at the end node increases while the probability that it is found at any other node decreases .",
    "eventually , the state is localized at the end node of the lattice at an instant of time @xmath49 , where @xmath0 is the number of nodes in the lattice . hence , if we define the speed of transport of the state as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the instant of time when the occupation probability at the end node of the lattice reaches its maximum value , then for quantum transport of a state from one end of a lattice to another to be efficient , @xmath52 , which is exactly what is observed for the quantum transport scheme due to the coupling between the system and the environment considered in this paper , for the conditions specified above .     of each node in the lattice from @xmath39 to @xmath53 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , with time step @xmath56 , for a 2-level system with a large gap between its ground and excited energy levels coupled to an environment with 5 energy levels , a ground energy level lower than the system s , and large gaps between each of its energy levels.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the effect of decreasing the spacing between the ground and excited energy levels of the system",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ occprobvaryingsystemenergygap ] .",
    "in particular , we see that for a relatively large energy gap between the ground state and excited state of the system , the coupling between the system and the environment will drive the system towards a steady state which occupies the end node of the system beginning at an instant of time less than the number of nodes in the lattice .",
    "this signifies that the transport process due to the coupling between the system and the environment is efficient , since the amount of time it takes for the end node of the lattice to be occupied is less than the total number of nodes in the lattice . on the other hand ,",
    "the smaller the energy gap between the ground state and excited state of the system , the smaller is the maximum value of the probability that the end node of the lattice is occupied .",
    "furthermore , as fig .",
    "[ occprobvaryingsystemenergygap ] shows , as the energy gap between the ground and excited states of the system decreases , the more likely that the steady state of the system will not be one that occupies the end node of the lattice .",
    "this implies that decreasing the energy gap between the system s energy levels also decreases the efficiency of the quantum transport process due to the coupling between the system and the environment .        as for the effect of increasing the number of energy levels available in the environment , fig .",
    "[ occprobvaryingenvtenergylevelnum ] shows that increasing the number of energy levels decreases the efficiency of the quantum transport process due to the coupling between the system and the environment .",
    "in particular , as the number of energy levels in the environment increases , the instant when the probability that the endpoint of the lattice is occupied is at its maximum occurs at an earlier time . however , the maximum value of this probability will also decrease .",
    "this then implies a decrease in the efficiency of the quantum transport process , since there is a nonzero probability that other nodes in the lattice other than the endpoint are occupied .",
    "while the number of energy levels present in the environment has an effect on the efficiency of the quantum transport scheme , the spacing between energy levels in the environment apparently has no effect whatsoever .",
    "therefore , an environment with a small number of discrete energy levels of arbitrary spacing from each other , coupled to a lattice of two - level systems , will create an efficient quantum transport scheme from one end of the lattice to the other .",
    "finally , there is the question of what exactly is the state that is transported to the end node of the lattice . to determine",
    "what state is transported to the end of the lattice , we compute for the trace distance between the state at the end of the lattice , as given by the density matrix @xmath57 , and a desired final state given by @xmath58 .",
    "the trace distance is defined as    @xmath59    where @xmath60 are the absolute values of the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix @xmath61 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tracedistgrndandexci ] , the trace distance drops off to zero if @xmath62 is an excited energy state of the system , while it rises to one if @xmath62 is a ground energy state of the system .",
    "this signifies that if the initial state of the system is the ground energy state , then the state transported to the end of the lattice is the excited energy state of the system .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ occprobandtracedist ] , wherein the occupation probability at the end of the lattice reaches its maximum value at the same instant that the trace distance between @xmath63 and @xmath62 equals zero , signifying that the state that is transported at the end of the lattice is indeed an excited energy state of the system .     at the end of a 100-node 1-d lattice and a target final state @xmath62 .",
    "the target final states at the end of the lattice are either the ground state @xmath64 or excited state @xmath65 of the system.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]     ( dashed line ) at the end of a 100-node 1-d lattice and a target final state @xmath62 .",
    "the target final state at the end of the lattice is the excited state @xmath65 of the system.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    we note that the calculations and results obtained up to this point in this section depend on the initial state of the system being in the ground energy state . if , however , the initial state is not the ground state , then the efficiency of the quantum transport scheme will be greatly affected . in particular , as shown in fig .",
    "[ occprobvaryinginitstate ] , the probability that the endpoint of the lattice will be occupied decreases if the initial state localized at the beginning of the lattice has the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath65 are the density matrices corresponding to the ground and excited states of the system .",
    "in fact , the maximum value of @xmath68 will be equal to the coefficient @xmath69 in the expression for the initial state @xmath41 as given by eq .",
    "[ initstategenform ] .    ,",
    "from the previous section , we found that it is possible to construct a dissipation induced quantum transport mechanism for excited states of a two - level system in a lattice by weakly coupling it to an environment with a small number of discrete energy levels .",
    "the resulting quantum transport mechanism will be efficient , in that the amount of time it will take to transport the excited energy state of the system from one end of the lattice to the other will be less than the number of nodes in the lattice .",
    "such a quantum transport mechanism has the advantage of eliminating active control over the system throughout the process .",
    "rather , it is the interaction between the system and the environment allows the quantum transport scheme to be carried out .",
    "all that is necessary to allow the quantum transport scheme to be carried out is to prepare and localize the initial state at one end of the lattice .",
    "we note that the quantum transport scheme for the system described in this paper is optimized for transporting excited states from one end of the lattice to another , with the initial state being the ground state for the system . however , the state that is transported to the other end is orthogonal to the initial state of the system localized in one end .",
    "there is no other mechanism present in the system other than its coupling with the environment to explain why the initial state localized in one end of the lattice is different from the state transported to the other end . as such , not only",
    "does the coupling between the system and the environment induce transportation of excited states from one end of the lattice to another , it also excites the initial state of the system from the ground to the excited energy level .",
    "hence , a full description of the dissipation induced quantum transport scheme due to the coupling between the system and the environment described in this paper can be given as follows : if the initial state of the system is in the ground state and is localized at one end of the lattice , the interaction between the system and the environment will first raise the energy of the initial state to the excited level , then will cause the excited state to be transported to the other end of the lattice at an instant of time less than the number of nodes in the lattice .    the results obtained in the previous section also imply that even if the initial state of the system is not entirely in the ground state , but rather is a superposition of the system s ground and excited states , coupling the system to the environment described in this paper will still cause an excited state of the system to be transported from one end of the lattice to the other .",
    "however , the efficiency of this quantum transport scheme in transporting the system s excited state from one end of the lattice to the other will be reduced , since the probability that the state transported to the end of the lattice is an excited state will be less than one . instead , what is transported to the other end of the lattice is the ground state of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the coupling between the system and the environment still results in a dissipative quantum transport scheme for either ground or excited energy states of the system , which first changes the energy of the initial state before transporting the resulting excited or deexcited energy state of the system from one end of the lattice to the other end .",
    "however , there are still issues that need to be resolved with this quantum transport scheme , foremost of which is its physical realizability . in particular",
    ", there is the question of what the explicit form of the system and the environment that can be used to realize this quantum transport scheme .",
    "one possible physical realization of this quantum transport scheme can be accomplished by taking an ensemble of two - level ultracold atoms confined to a lattice as our system , and weakly coupling these two - level atoms in the lattice to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , whose ground state energy is much less than the ground state of the two - level atoms in the lattice .",
    "we note that becs have been proposed as environments coupled to particular systems before , in particular in refs .",
    "they are able to absorb and emit excitations from and into the system to which they are coupled , in effect serving as energy reservoirs . in doing so",
    ", they can be used to realize dissipative quantum preparation and transport schemes for a variety of states .",
    "as such , this makes them a natural choice as the environment for the dissipation induced quantum transport scheme described in this paper .",
    "we leave the issue of the physical realization of this quantum transport scheme , as well as other possible issues arising from the formulation of the scheme , for future work .",

    "<S> we construct a dissipation induced quantum transport scheme by coupling a finite lattice of @xmath0 two - level systems to an environment with a discrete number of energy levels . with the environment acting as a reservoir of energy excitations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coupling between the system and the environment gives rise to a mechanism for excited states of the system to be efficiently transported from one end of the lattice to another . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that we can adjust the efficiency of the quantum transport scheme by varying the spacing between energy levels of the system , by decreasing the ground state energy level of the environment , and by weakening the coupling between the system and the environment . </S>",
    "<S> a possible realization of this quantum transport scheme using ultracold atoms in a lattice coupled to a reservoir of energy excitations is briefly discussed at the end of this paper . </S>"
