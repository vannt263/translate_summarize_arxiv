    "high - energy heavy - ion collision studies at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite have firmly established the formation of a strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) close to local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "evidence for this is provided by the hydrodynamical analyses of collective flow , which require an extremely small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the precise extraction of @xmath8 depends crucially on the adequate knowledge of the initial - state dynamics , the lack of which , at present , represents the largest uncertainty in the hydrodynamic modeling of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "smooth ( nonfluctuating ) initial energy - density distributions based on the glauber or color - glass - condensate ( cgc ) models have been used successfully to describe the elliptic flow @xmath9 , albeit with differing values of @xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "event - by - event fluctuations in the initial configuration of the system are solely responsible for the ( rapidity - even ) odd flow harmonics , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations are also important in explaining the double - peaked structure in the final dihadron correlations across large rapidities @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo method has been invoked to simulate event - by - event geometric fluctuations in the number and positions of the participant nucleons ( mc - glauber ) @xcite or of intrinsic gluons ( mc - cgc ) @xcite .",
    "both methods give rise to  lumpy \" initial conditions and are able to reproduce elliptic flow data at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "mc - cgc yields a relatively larger initial eccentricity and and hence requires larger viscous damping ( @xmath8 ) to explain the elliptic flow data .",
    "however , it underpredicts the triangular flow data @xcite .",
    "most of these model studies `` switch on '' hydrodynamics at a specified early time , ignoring the preequilibrium dynamical evolution towards the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "indeed , various ansatze and parametrizations have been adopted to describe the initial distribution of the unknown kinetic and thermodynamic quantities in these models .    in a more recent study ,",
    "the preequilibrium dynamics was approximately accounted for by combining an impact - parameter - dependent saturation model with the classical yang - mills description of the flowing glasma fields @xcite .",
    "the model considered the color charge fluctuations inside the nucleon as well and could describe remarkably well the transverse - momentum ( @xmath11)-dependent and @xmath11-integrated flow harmonics @xmath12 data at lhc @xcite . a fully dynamical simulation which included solutions to anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) for the preequilibrium stage and the standard viscous hydrodynamics for the equilibrium stage",
    "was recently developed @xcite .",
    "preequilibrium dynamics has also been accounted for in the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) string dynamics model @xcite .",
    "these studies underscore the importance of including the inherent fluctuations at both nucleonic and partonic levels as well as the initial - state preequilibrium dynamics .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study various aspects of the hydrodynamic flow in a model with an initial state that includes fluctuations at the nucleonic as well as subnucleonic levels and which moreover considers preequilibrium dynamics of partonic matter . for this purpose",
    "we have used a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model @xcite that consistently incorporates these fluctuations in the preequilibrium phase .",
    "for the subsequent near - equilibrium evolution , the standard ( 2 + 1)-dimensional [ ( 2 + 1)d ] viscous hydrodynamics code vish2 + 1 @xcite is used until the matter reaches freeze - out .",
    "the version of ampt used in this paper has the initial conditions based on the hijing 2.0 model @xcite , which employs the glauber model with woods - saxon nuclear distribution to determine the nucleon configuration in an event .",
    "while the soft ( binary ) nucleon - nucleon collisions lead to string excitations , the hard collisions produce uncorrelated minijet partons .",
    "fluctuations in the minijet parton multiplicity follow the poisson distribution where the average multiplicity ( determined by the minijet cross section ) increases strongly with the center - of - mass energy @xcite . we have employed the string - melting version of ampt @xcite for the initial partonic state , which consistently incorporates these fluctuations and describes better the final collective behavior of hadrons . in this version the strings melt into their constituent quarks and antiquarks , whose positions are determined randomly within the string , which is yet another source of fluctuations .",
    "the scatterings among these quarks and minijet partons are treated with zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) with a parton - parton elastic cross section of 1.5 mb .    at the switchover time @xmath13 , from the microscopic ampt model to the macroscopic viscous vish2 + 1 hydrodynamic model @xcite , the local energy - momentum density , baryon number density , and the flow velocity in an event can be estimated from the positions and momenta of the formed partons at midrapidity",

    "we find that the spectra for @xmath58 and @xmath59 from the full ampt+hydro simulations are in good overall agreement with the experimental data .",

    "<S> complete evolution of the strongly interacting matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is studied within a coupled boltzmann and relativistic viscous hydrodynamics approach . for the initial nonequilibrium evolution phase , </S>",
    "<S> we employ a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model that explicitly includes event - by - event fluctuations in the number and positions of the participating nucleons as well as of the produced partons with subsequent parton transport . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing near - equilibrium evolution of quark - gluon and hadronic matter is modeled within the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we probe the role of parton dynamics in generating and maintaining the spatial anisotropy in the preequilibrium phase . </S>",
    "<S> substantial spatial eccentricities @xmath0 are found to be generated in the event - by - event fluctuations in parton production from initial nucleon - nucleon collisions . for ultracentral heavy - ion collisions , </S>",
    "<S> the model is able to explain qualitatively the unexpected hierarchy of the harmonic flow coefficients @xmath1 observed at energies currently available at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the results for @xmath2 are rather insensitive to the variation ( within a range ) of the time of switchover from ampt parton transport to hydrodynamic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the usual grad and the recently proposed chapman - enskog - like ( nonequilibrium ) single - particle distribution functions are found to give very similar results for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes well both the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider and lhc data for @xmath2 at various centralities , with a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of 0.08 and 0.12 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the event - by - event distributions of @xmath4 are in good agreement with the lhc data for midcentral collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the linear response relation @xmath5 is found to be true for @xmath6 , except at large values of @xmath0 , where a larger value of @xmath7 is required , suggesting a small admixture of positive nonlinear response even for @xmath6 . </S>"
