    "the goal of this paper is to build a consistent , fully nonlinear conformal hydrodynamics , capable of describing the early time evolution of a free streaming anisotropic flow while reducing to second order hydrodynamics for small deviations from ideal behavior . to avoid the proliferation of transport coefficients that plagues attempts to pursue the usual schemes , such as chapman - enskog or grad expansions , to higher orders",
    ", we shall impose the strong principle that the dynamics of the theory is given by the conservation laws for the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) and a new so - called nonequilibrium current ( nec ) defined through a third order tensor .",
    "we shall impose the further restriction that both currents may be derived as gradients of a vector massieu function .",
    "our objective is not to find a realistic theory , but a model with the right conservation laws and a minimum of free parameters , which may be used to explore strongly nonlinear behavior in the relativistic regime .    the mounting evidence that relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite provide an experimental realization of relativistic real fluids @xcite has spurred a strong interest on the characterization of those systems , and as a result we now have a fairly robust model of their dynamics in the limit of short relaxation times @xcite .",
    "however , this very success highlights our lack of understanding of how such a relativistic fluid comes into being in the first place @xcite . to tackle that issue we need to consider phenomena on time scales which are no longer very large compared with the relaxation time , of which the non linear evolution of plasma instabilities @xcite , shocks @xcite , kolmogorov @xcite and wave turbulence @xcite are paramount .",
    "maybe contrary to expectations , it has been found that the language of hydrodynamics is still useful in this regime @xcite .",
    "the assumption of free streaming , namely an infinite relaxation time , makes sense at early times .",
    "moreover , in this limit we have simple exact solutions to the kinetic theory ( reduced to just the liouville equation for the one particle distribution function ( 1pdf ) ) which provide a test bench for hydrodynamics .",
    "a particular set of solutions which has received much attention are boost invariant , axially symmetric 1pdfs described by a function of a single variable and parametrized by a few ( milne ) time dependent parameters @xcite . in this case",
    "it has been shown that energy momentum conservation and a second conservation law derived from the third moment of the liouville equation determine the time evolution of those parameters , matching exactly the evolution prescribed by the full liouville equation .",
    "this observation has led to the development of so - called anisotropic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "other exact solutions are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "free streaming is a worst case scenario for any relativistic hydrodynamics formalism .",
    "collisions will tend to make the system evolve first towards a local equilibrium configuration , and then will damp out temperature gradients .",
    "close enough to thermality , most formalisms will agree with second - order relativistic hydrodynamics ; for the case of the `` divergence type '' theories we shall discuss below , we show this in section v. the problems show up in the opposite limit , where there is no bound on how far flow can get from a thermal state . therefore , any contending formalism must prove its worth by showing it is capable of handling free streaming .",
    "if one considers ( color ) perturbations of a boost invariant background , then the usual plasma instabilities are found .",
    "the formalism of anisotropic hydrodynamics may be used to follow those instabilities and to estimate at what time the linearized theory breaks down @xcite .",
    "however , to the present author s understanding it can not be pursued beyond that point because we do not have a full nonlinear theory whereby we could compute the back reaction of the unstable modes on the expanding background .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate which shape such a nonlinear hydrodynamics may have ( see also ) .    to this end",
    "we shall consider theories patterned on geroch - lindblom `` divergence type '' hydrodynamics ( dtt)@xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are given by the conservation laws for the emt @xmath0 and the nec @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a conformal colorless fluid , so there will be no conservation law for charge or particle number .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the theory are a inverse temperature four vector @xmath2 and a second order nonequilibrium tensor @xmath3 .",
    "a most important assumption is that there is a massieu function current @xmath4 such that @xmath0 and @xmath1 may be obtained as derivatives of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this assumption is key to give the approach predictive power .",
    "the hydrodynamic formalism is linked to kinetic theory by relating @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the second and third moments of the 1pdf @xcite .",
    "we shall match those theories against a family of exact boost invariant solutions of the liouville equations .",
    "for these solutions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are determined by just two moments of the 1pdf .",
    "given those two parameters , we show how a fully nonlinear hydrodynamic theory may be build that reproduces the known early time evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting theories are probably too complex to be relevant in practice .",
    "however , we also show a simple theory which captures the early time behavior , and may be useful to investigate nonlinear effects in this regime .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we present the boost invariant , axisymmetric free streaming solutions and compute the emt and the nec . then in section iii we derive the most general hydrodynamic theory where these currents may be derived as derivatives of a single vector potential . finally in section iv we match hydrodynamics to the exact solution , and in section v we analyze the inclusion of viscosity and the behavior of the theory for small deviations from ideal behavior , whereby it reduces to a version of second order hydrodynamics @xcite .",
