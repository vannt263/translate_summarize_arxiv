    "understanding how and when galaxies form has been a central problem in cosmology for the past few decades ( e.g. white & rees 1978 , blumenthal et al .",
    "one of the main recent developments of this field has been the realization of the key role played by nuclear activity due to accretion onto supermassive black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "nuclear activity and supermassive bhs have been suggested to be relevant for a variety of phenomena , including regulating star formation at galaxy scales via energy feedback to solve the ` downsizing ' problem ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; treu et al . 2005a , b ; bundy et al .",
    "2005 ; juneau et al .",
    "2005 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) , providing extra energy to solve the ` cooling flow ' problem ( e.g. dalla vecchia et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) , and altering the inner regions of early - type galaxies to solve the ` inner cusp / core ' problem ( milosavljevic , et al .  2002 ; graham 2004 ; boylan - kolchin , ma & quataert 2004 ) .    the best supporting evidences for a strong connection between galaxy formation and nuclear activity are the tight empirical scaling relations connecting the mass of the central supermassive bh with global properties of the host galaxy , such as bulge luminosity ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) and mass ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , hring & rix 2004 ) , galaxy - light concentration ( graham et al . 2001 ) , and stellar velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . the latter correlation , the so - called m@xmath0 relation has received particular attention for its tightness , which has been suggested to be consistent with no intrinsic scatter ( but see novak , faber & dekel 2006 for a statistical analysis of the existing correlations ) .",
    "the extension of the known empirical correlations between galaxy properties at kpc scales ( such as the fundamental plane , dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) to the pc scales of the sphere of influence of the central bh indicates that the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive bhs are connected at a fundamental level .",
    "the variety of scales involved makes this a challenging topic to study from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view . from a theoretical point of view , even the most advanced numerical cosmological simulations ( e.g. springel et al . 2005 ) do not have enough dynamical range to resolve the scales relevant to the central bh .",
    "thus , theoretical studies generally follow one of these two approaches ( see , e.g. , stiavelli 1998 , miralda - escud & kollmeier 2005 , and references therein for different approaches ) : i ) studying the scaling relations of remnants of mergers of cosmologically inspired progenitors , simulated in as much physical detail as possible ( e.g. robertson et al . 2005 ) ; ii ) adopting a semi - analytic approach where the effects of nuclear activity are coupled to dark matter merging trees via analytic empirical recipes , similar to the way interstellar medium and stars are treated ( e.g. kauffmann & haenelt 2000 ; volonteri et al . 2003 ; menci et al . 2003 ; vittorini , shankar & cavaliere 2005 ; croton et al . 2005 ; cattaneo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the results of these calculations clearly illustrate the complexity of the problem . even imposing the local scaling relations as the end - point of the coevolutionary models ,",
    "many diverse results can be obtained .",
    "for example , in terms of numerical simulations of mergers , it appears that the scaling laws can be either preserved or destroyed during a merger , depending on the properties of the progenitors ( e.g. dry or gas rich ) , and the uncertain fate of the central bhs ( merger with mass conservation , mass - loss through gravitational radiation , and ejection ) .",
    "when these results are placed into a cosmological framework for the progenitors , a prediction on the evolution of the m@xmath0 relation can be obtained .",
    "for example , robertson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) predict that the relation should evolve in the sense of velocity dispersion increasing with redshift for a fixed bh mass .",
    "analogously , depending on the details of the modeling of gas accretion on the central bh and assembly of the stellar mass , semi - analytic models can predict the evolution of the scaling relations , with a variety of outcomes .",
    "for example , kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) find the m@xmath0 relation to be constant with redshift  providing a natural explanation for its tightness while croton ( 2005 ) finds that stellar mass ( and hence presumably velocity dispersion ) decreases as a function of redshift for a fixed bh mass .",
    "from the observers point of view , three main lines of inquiry are being pursued to reconstruct the coevolution of spheroids and bhs .",
    "firstly , improving the determination of the local scaling laws , e.g. extending the samples in size and dynamic ranges , measuring their coefficient , scatter and distribution of residuals .",
    "the local relationships are the foundation of the bh - galaxy connection , and contain important evolutionary clues in the form of ` fossil evidence ' .",
    "for example , nipoti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find it impossible to preserve all scaling laws during collisionless mergers , and use this finding to rule out dry mergers as the only mechanism for spheroid formation ( see also ciotti & van albada 2001 ; kazantsidis et al . 2005 ; treu et al .",
    "in addition  if selection effects are properly taken into account  the intrinsic scatter of the correlation can be used to constrain formation models ( robertson et al .",
    "2005 ; wyithe & loeb 2005 ) .",
    "increasing the number of objects with well - measured bh mass  through stellar and gas kinematics for inactive bhs or reverberation mapping for active nuclei is painstakingly difficult with present technology , but nevertheless important progress is being made ( see , e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "2005 ) and substantial improvement is expected with the next generation of telescopes and adaptive optics systems .",
    "the second line of evidence ( e.g. soltan 1982 ) is provided by the demographics of galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . since the energy irradiated by nuclear activity",
    "is often supposed to be proportional to the mass accretion rate onto the bh , the luminosity function of agn and its evolution measure the build up of bhs , although the mass accretion rate could be much higher at high redshift . among other results ",
    "e.g. on the consistency of the mass function of local bhs with that inferred from the accretion history ( salucci et al .",
    "1999 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al . 2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "2004) this kind of arguments points towards an anti - hierarchical ( ` downsizing ' ) growth of bhs , with the more massive bhs ( @xmath10 ) growing at earlier times ( @xmath11 ) with respect to their less massive counterparts ( marconi et al .  2004 ; see also small & blandford 1992 ; tamura , ohta , & ueda 2005 ; merloni 2004 ; heckman et al .",
    "2004 ) . taking a further step , merloni , rudnick & di matteo ( 2004 )",
    "combine the bh mass accretion history with the star formation history of the universe to find that the growth of bhs appear to predate that of bulges . in other words ,",
    "the bulge - to - bh mass ratio is a decreasing function of redshift , consistent  at least qualitatively  with independent evidence for significant mass assembly in spheroids since @xmath12 ( bell et al .",
    "2005 ; treu et al .  2005a , b ; bundy et al .",
    "2005 ) and for similarities between the star formation histories of active and inactive galaxies ( hunt et al . 1997,1999",
    "; hunt & malkan 2004 ; woo et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) . in this scenario , bhs would reach their almost final mass early - on and then the bulge would grow around them , with the local scaling - laws as the evolutionary end - point .",
    "the third approach consists of measuring directly the evolution of scaling laws over cosmic time .",
    "the main obstacle to overcome to reach this goal is the determination of the bh mass at distances where the sphere of influence ( with a radius @xmath13 ) can not be resolved .",
    "this approach is thus limited to active bhs , where the mass of the bhs can be inferred from the kinematics of the broad emission line region and its distance from the nucleus ( obtained via reverberation mapping or some empirically calibrated surrogate , see   4 ) .",
    "in turn , by restricting the analysis to active bhs , it is more difficult to measure the properties of the host galaxy , and it is important to understand any caveats introduced when comparing to the local benchmark sample of mainly non - active galaxies .    in spite of the challenges and the limitations , this approach is",
    "the only one that allows a direct mapping of the coevolution of bhs and spheroids , and thus is an extremely valuable complement to the first two described above , lifting many of the degeneracies introduced by evolution ( fossil evidence ) or by population averages ( bh and galaxy demographics ) . for these reasons",
    "a few groups have been attacking the problem using different observational strategies .",
    "walter et al .  ( 2004 ) use spatially resolved radio observations to estimate the mass of the host galaxy of a qso at z=6.41 , with a result almost two orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by the local bh - spheroid relation for the value of bh mass measured by willott et al .",
    "in contrast , shields et al.(2003 ) use the width of the [ ] narrow line as a surrogate for the stellar velocity dispersion of a sample of bright qso , finding no evidence for evolution of the m@xmath0 relation out to @xmath14 , although with a large scatter .",
    "our group is following a different approach , taking smaller steps in redshifts and striving to achieve the most accurate possible measurements of each parameter .",
    "as described in our first paper ( treu , malkan & blandford 2004 , hereafter tmb04 ) , we target seyfert 1 galaxies to simultaneously measure agn broad line width and host galaxy stellar velocity dispersion in specific redshift intervals , where sky emission and absorption can be avoided ( see   2.1 ) .",
    "our pilot study found tentative evidence of evolution , in the sense that our 7 objects had smaller velocity dispersion for given bh mass than expected from the local correlations .",
    "this paper seeks to expand and improve on the pilot study in order to verify this tantalizing and perhaps surprising finding .",
    "the main improvements over the previous study include : i ) a larger dataset ( 20 objects ) with better quality keck data ( s / n up to 100@xmath9 as opposed to @xmath15 50 @xmath9 of the pilot study and thus smaller uncertainty on the velocity dispersion ; ii ) higher completeness to limit possible selection effect ( 14/20 velocity dispersions measured as opposed to 7/13 ) ; iii ) a detailed analysis of many potential sources of systematic uncertainties , including that due to the broad nuclear fe ii contamination to the spectral region used for velocity dispersion measurement ; iv ) improved estimates of bh masses based on the extensive work done by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to calibrate the scaling relations between continuum luminosity , h@xmath2 width and bh mass .",
    "high resolution images taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) are also available and will be used in this paper to interpret the results ( a detailed analysis of the hst - acs images will be presented in the second paper of this series , hereafter paper ii ) .    the paper is organized as follows , in ",
    "2 we describe sample selection , observations and data reduction . in ",
    "3 we describe stellar velocity dispersion measurements and discuss the viability of [ ] as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion . in ",
    "4 we derive the bh mass and discuss its relation with other agn properties . in   5 we present the evolution of the m@xmath0 relation .",
    "section  6 summarizes a number of tests aimed at investigating possible systematic uncertainties . in   7 we discuss our results and their implications for the coevolution of spheroids and bhs . section  8 concludes with a brief summary . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 km sec@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 .",
    "as in our pilot study , the choice of targets is key to the success of this experiment . on the one hand , the sphere of influence of supermassive bhs in galaxies at cosmological distances can not be resolved even with hst .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to target active galaxies , where bh mass can be obtained from the integrated properties of the broad line region  as described in section  [ sec : bhm ] . on the other hand , in order to measure the _ stellar velocity dispersion _ from absorption lines , we need to target relatively low luminosity agns where the fraction of stellar light in the integrated spectrum is non - negligible .",
    "this is because in distant galaxies , ground - based telescopes can not separate the emission of the host galaxy from that of the agn .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies provide the right balance between the two components : absorption features typical of old stellar populations such as the mgb triplet ( @xmath15 5175 ) and fe ( 5270 ) ( trager et al .",
    "1998 ) are clearly visible in their high s / n integrated spectra . in order to minimize the systematic uncertainties related to sky subtraction and atmospheric absorption corrections , it is convenient to select specific redshift windows where the relevant emission and absorption lines ( h@xmath2 , mgb , and fe ) fall in clean regions of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "accordingly , we selected the `` clean window '' @xmath19 , which corresponds to a look - back time of @xmath20 gyrs .    a first object ( ms1558 + 453 ; hereafter s99 ; stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) was selected for a pilot study ( see tmb04 ) .",
    "when the sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ) became available , a larger sample of objects was selected according to the following criteria : @xmath21 , and h@xmath2 equivalent width and gaussian width greater than 5  in the rest frame .",
    "all sdss spectra satisfying these criteria were visually inspected by two of us ( tt and mam ) and objects showing strong fe ii nuclear emission ( the main obstacle to velocity dispersion measurement ) were eliminated from the sample .",
    "the relevant properties of the observed objects are listed in table  [ t_target ] .",
    "although targets were initially selected from the sdss dr1 and dr2 , all sdss related quantities listed in this paper have been updated to reflect all the recalibrations available from dr4 . throughout this paper",
    "we will make limited use of morphological information derived from an ongoing imaging program with the advanced camera for surveys on board hst ( go-10216 ; pi treu ) to interpret our results .",
    "high s / n ratio spectra of 20 targets were obtained with the lris spectrograph at the keck - i telescope in five runs between march 2003 and july 2005 .",
    "the 900 lines mm@xmath9 grating centered at 6700  was used most of the time , yielding a pixel scale of 0.85@xmath22215 and a resolution of @xmath1555 km s@xmath9 . for two objects , s28 and s29",
    ", we used the 831 lines mm@xmath9 grating , with which @xmath1567 km s@xmath9 resolution was obtained .",
    "observing conditions were generally mediocre , plagued by cirrus and humidity , except for the last runs in may 22 2004 and july 2005 .",
    "table  [ t_journal ] shows the journal of observations and instrumental setups .",
    "typically more than two exposures per object were obtained to ensure proper cosmic ray removal , with total exposure times ranging between 600 and 12600 seconds .",
    "taking advantage of the good observing conditions , the exposure times for the last observing run were much higher than in previous runs and some objects with marginal quality spectra were reobserved with longer exposure times ( e.g. s05 was observed for 3 hours in addition to the 0.5 hrs obtained during the september 2003 run ) .",
    "internal flat fields were obtained before and after observing each object , so as to correct the fringing pattern of the red ccd .",
    "a set of a0v stars , selected from the hipparcos catalog to be within @xmath23 15 degrees from each target , was observed during the night as secondary flux calibrators and to measure the b - band atmospheric absorption .",
    "spectrophotometric standards were observed at the beginning and at the end of each night .",
    "the standard data reduction processes including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , spectral extraction , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration were performed using a series of iraf scripts .",
    "cosmic rays were removed from each individual exposure using the laplacian cosmic ray identification software ( van dokkum 2001 ) .",
    "sky emission lines were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "optimal extraction was used for obtaining one - dimensional spectra with maximal s / n .",
    "typical extraction radius was 45 pixels , corresponding to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 kpc at @xmath3 ) .",
    "individual spectra were combined with inverse - variance weighting to make the final spectrum ( s / n is in the range of 31 to 111 per 0.85 pixel for the combined spectra ) .",
    "the relatively featureless spectra of the a0v hipparcus stars were used to correct the atmospheric absorption ( including the prominent b - band ) and perform relative flux calibration .",
    "internal tests show that this procedure yields the necessary correction of the b - band absorption to a level of a few parts in a thousand and relative flux calibration to a few percent ( confirmed also by comparing our spectra to the sdss spectra ) .",
    "the final flux - calibrated spectra of all 20 observed agns are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note the higher s / n ratio of spectra obtained in 2005 with respect to the older spectra .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions of external galaxies are often measured from strong absorption lines such as the g - band ( 4304 ) , the mgb triplet ( @xmath15 5175 ) , fe ( 5270 ) , and the ca ii triplet ( @xmath15 8550  ) . for the host galaxies of broad line agns ,",
    "the g - band is impractical due to contamination from h@xmath26 , while the mgb - fe and the ca ii triplet regions represent viable choices , provided spectra of sufficiently high s / n are available ( nelson & whittle 1996 ; barth et al .",
    "2003 ; woo et al .",
    "2004 ; greene & ho 2005c ) . in this study",
    ", we focus on the mgb - fe region , since the ca ii triplet is redshifted outside the wavelength range accessible with optical spectrographs .",
    "higher s / n than for quiescent galaxies is needed to compensate for the dilution of stellar features by the agn continuum , scaling as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fraction of stellar light in the integrated spectrum .",
    "systematic errors such as those due to correction for atmospheric absorption must also be smaller than for quiescent galaxies by a factor of @xmath28 to account for line dilution . as discussed in section  [ ssec : sigma ] , the quality of our spectra is sufficient to recover velocity dispersion with an uncertainty of 10% or better .",
    "however , before we can proceed to measure velocity dispersion , we need to address an important possible source of systematics , contamination of the agn power - law continuum by broad nuclear fe ii emission . in our pilot paper",
    "the fe ii contribution was removed using high order polynomials . in this paper",
    "we improve on our fe ii emission subtraction by using the i zwicky 1 local fe ii template ( boroson & green 1992 ; kindly provided by todd boroson ) as described in the next section .      in the case of host galaxies of type 1 agns ,",
    "strong fe ii emission around 5150 - 5350   complicates velocity dispersion measurements from the mgb and fe lines since the observed continuum shape is very different from that of template stars . to reduce potential systematic errors on dispersion measurements",
    ", we decided to subtract broad fe ii emission from the observed spectra before fitting with template stars ( for a consistency check , we also measured velocity dispersion from spectra without fe ii emission subtraction . see ",
    "[ ssec : feiicheck ] ) .",
    "we subtracted broad fe ii emission using the i zw 1 template .",
    "first , following boroson & green ( 1992 ) , we prepared a set of fe ii templates with various widths and strengths .",
    "then , for the purpose of this fit , we added a power - law spectrum representing locally the featureless agn continuum , and a constant representing the stellar component : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the continuum slope , @xmath31 and @xmath32 set width and strength of fe ii template , and @xmath33 represents the stellar flux .",
    "for each set of parameters , the model spectrum was compared with observed spectra to compute the @xmath34 . by @xmath35",
    "fitting , we derived the best fit width and strength of broad fe ii emission , and the slope of agn continuum as demonstrated in fig .",
    "since we are interested in removing broad fe ii emission to ease the stellar velocity dispersion measurements , we only used the 5100 - 5400 region to fit the fe ii emission .    the fe ii emission subtracted spectra",
    "are compared with the observed spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig_fe iisub ] .",
    "we note that there is a range of fe ii emission strengths ( 324% in total luminosity at 5100 - 5500 ) .",
    "fe ii emission is stronger for s01 , s03 , s05 , s07 , s10 , s11 , s21 , s29 while fe ii emission is negligible for other cases .",
    "stellar absorption features are clearly shown in many agn spectra .",
    "however , we can not identify stellar lines for 6 objects , i.e. s02 , s03 , s10 , s21 , s27 , and s29 , most likely due to the much higher agn continuum .",
    "velocity dispersions were obtained by comparing in pixel space the observed host galaxy spectra with stellar templates broadened with a gaussian velocity width ranging between 50 - 400 km s@xmath9 .",
    "we used as kinematic templates high resolution spectra of 5 giant stars ( spectral types : g8 , g9 , k0 , k2 , and k5 ) observed with esi on keck - ii ( sand et al .",
    "fits were performed for every template to estimate uncertainties due to template mismatch , while the best fitting template was used for the final dispersion measurements .",
    "the minimum @xmath34 fit was performed using the gauss - hermite pixel fitting software ( van der marel 1994 ) .",
    "the merit of fitting in pixel space as opposed to fourier space is that typical agn narrow emission lines ( e.g. [ fe vii ] 5160 , [ n i ] 5201 , and [ fe xiv ] 5304 ; vanden berk et al . 2001 ) can be easily masked out ( e.g. barth et al .  2002 ; tmb04 ;",
    "woo et al .",
    "2004 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_dis ] ) .",
    "extensive tests , fitting in various spectral regions including mgb 5175 and fe 5270 , were performed to determine the best spectral regions . as expected , we find that the fe line at 5270 is most useful in the cases when the mgb triplet is mostly affected by narrow agn emission lines ( see greene & ho 2005c ) . low order polynomials ( 2 - 3 )",
    "were used to model the overall shape of the continuum . for 14 out of 20 objects we determined reliable velocity dispersions , i.e. robust with respect to changes of template , continuum polynomial order , and fitting region .",
    "the final measurements are listed in table  [ data ] . for the subsample in common with tmb04 the values listed in table  [ data ] supersede those in the pilot study , given the improved data quality and analysis .",
    "narrow - line clouds have been suggested to be bound predominantly by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy bulge ( nelson & whittle 1996 ) , providing an opportunity to use the width of [ ] @xmath365007 as a readily measurable surrogate for stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "this method has been applied to higher redshifts and less favorable agn - to - stellar light ratios ( e.g. shields et al .",
    "2003 ) .    the characteristically asymmetric profile of the [ ] lines ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) implies that this assumption is an approximation and some non - gravitational broadening is present ( see boroson 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , several studies show that the [ ] width can trace the velocity dispersion only in a statistical sense when a large sample is available ( boroson 2003 ; nelson et al .",
    "2004 ; bonning et al .  2005 ; greene & ho 2005a ; hicks 2005 ) , and when appropriate care is taken in dealing with the wings of the line profile .    here",
    "we take advantage of our high quality spectra to revisit the question of what the best proxy is , i.e. what measure of the [ ] line width provides the tightest and least biased correlation with stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we measured [ ] line widths in three different ways , commonly used in the literature .",
    "first , we fitted [ ] with a single gaussian , as typically done with low s / n spectra .",
    "second , we measured the fwhm from its definition ( e.g. brotherton 1996 ; bonning et al .",
    "third , we removed the blue wing ",
    "present for all 14 objects  by fitting two gaussian components ( e.g. greene & ho 2005a ) .",
    "all these measurements were done with the splot task in iraf after subtracting the continuum .    in fig  [ fig_oiii_sig ]",
    ", we compare the stellar velocity dispersion with [ ] velocities obtained with three different methods , assuming @xmath37 when necessary . as expected , since all 14 objects show clear asymmetry with a blue wing , a single gaussian component does not provide a good fit and the proxy generally overestimates the stellar velocity dispersion by 15% on average ( left panel ) , i.e. @xmath38 . the simple fwhm does a better job , reproducing the stellar velocity dispersion with an average offset of less than 5% ( center panel ) .",
    "in contrast , when the blue wing is removed , [ ] line widths are systematically smaller leading to an underestimate of the stellar velocity dispersion by almost 20% .",
    "we find similar scatter for all cases @xmath15 25% , smaller than 0.2 dex found by nelson & whittle ( 1996 ; see also onken et al .",
    "2005 ) , but still a significantly larger uncertainty than what can be achieved via direct determination ( 10% ) from stellar absorption features .",
    "although based on this test the fwhm appears to be the best [ ] based proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion , the non - gravitational broadening may depend on properties such as accretion rate ( e.g. greene & ho 2005a ) and therefore our results may not apply to _ all _ kinds of agns .",
    "what appears to be a solid conclusions is that the intrinsic scatter is larger than typical error on the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the results from this section will be used in   [",
    "sec : disc ] when discussing our results in comparison with other studies based on the [ ] proxy .",
    "the mass of supermassive bhs beyond the local universe can not be directly measured from the spatially resolved kinematics because of the limited spatial resolution of the current instruments . in the case of agns , the size of the broad - line region , r@xmath39 , can be measured via reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) . combining the size of the broad line region with its kinematics , as inferred from the line width ,",
    "gives the mass of the bh up to a ` shape ' factor of order unity which depends on the three - dimensional geometry and kinematic structure ( peterson 1993 ; peterson et al.2004 ) .",
    "the shape factor has recently been calibrated by onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , by requiring active galaxies to obey the same m@xmath0 relation as quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , reverberation mapping requires long - term monitoring and it is extremely expensive to obtain for a large sample of agns , especially at high - redshift .",
    "instead , the so - called ` virial ' bh mass is often estimated from a single - epoch spectrum using the empirical radius - luminosity relation , i.e. the correlation between r@xmath39 and the optical luminosity at 5100 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ) . on physical grounds",
    ", r@xmath40 is expected to scale as the square root of the luminosity in ionizing photons .",
    "although the exact dependence on the optical luminosity can not be calculated directly from first principles , it has been calibrated empirically ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "for this reason we will refer to the method used to obtain bh masses in this paper as empirically - calibrated photo - ionization ( ecpi ) method .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the latest calibrations ( onken et al .",
    "2004 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ) of the local reverberation mass shape factor of the r@xmath39-l@xmath41 relationship , to derive bh masses : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the second moment of the h@xmath2 line profile and @xmath44 is the monochromatic luminosity at 5100 , in the rest frame , measured as discussed in the next sections .",
    "based on comparisons of reverberation data and single - epoch data ( vestergaard 2002 ; see also ",
    "[ ssec : hbetatest ] ) , it is estimated that the intrinsic uncertainty associated with this method is approximately a factor of 2.5 , i.e. 0.4 dex , on the bh mass .",
    "this uncertainty dominates the errors on our input quantities , @xmath45 and l@xmath41 , and we adopt it as our total uncertainty on the bh mass .    in closing",
    ", we note that the normalization of onken et al .",

    "first , we identify the continuum level on each side of h@xmath2 .",
    "we typically used 50 windows in the range 4690 - 4780  and 5010 - 5130  to measure the the blue and red continuum levels .",
    "we then subtracted the continuum by linear interpolation .",
    "second , we subtracted [ ] @xmath464959 by dividing [ ] @xmath465007 by 3 and blueshifting .",

    "the flux ratio of h@xmath2/ [ ] @xmath465007 is found to be in the range 6 - 16% , consistent with other studies ( e.g. marziani et al .",
    "fourth , we measure the second moment of the line profile for minimum ( zero ) and maximum acceptable narrow components .",
    "when the h@xmath2 profile is very large and clearly goes under [ ] @xmath465007 line , we obtained this red wing shape by reflecting the blue wing around the centroid of the broad component .",
    "the statistical noise on the measurement is negligible , given the quality of the spectra .",
    "the three potential sources of systematic error are removal of the narrow core of h@xmath2 , the definition of the continuum level , and the contribution to the second moment of broad h@xmath2 from the wavelength region under [ ] @xmath465007 . varying the intensity of the narrow component of h@xmath2 changes the second moment by only a few per cent , which is negligible for our purposes . changing the wavelength regions defining the continuum level does not significantly affect the line width except for the case of s99 , where there is a distinct core superposed on a much broader redshifted component . the low contrast and large width of the latter component makes its measurement particularly sensitive to the choice of continuum .",
    "similar profiles are sometimes observed in the low states of local seyfert 1 galaxies such as ngc 3227 and ngc 3516 ( rosenblatt et al .",
    "if the red continuum were chosen to be at the base between the [ oiii ] 4959 and 5007 lines , the second moment would be reduced by a factor of 2 , resulting in a smaller bh mass estimate by a factor of 4 .",
    "however , as in those local galaxies , it is clear that the h@xmath2 wing actually does extend to larger positive velocities than 8000 km sec@xmath9 , so that the continuum we chose on the red side of 5007 is more realistic .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are unchanged if the narrower line width is adopted for s99 .",
    "three objects , namely , s12 , s21 and s23 show a prominently asymmetric broad - line profile .",
    "the extension of the line underneath [ ] @xmath465007 is therefore unclear , and could result in a small uncertainty .",
    "we measured for these objects line widths with / without h@xmath2 wing underneath of [ ] @xmath465007 , and find less than 4% change , suggesting that errors due to red wing of h@xmath2 are negligible .",

    "mgb and fe lines arise from relatively old stellar populations ( e.g. trager et al .",
    "therefore , the contribution from the younger stars in the disks to these lines should be small with respect to the contribution to the optical continuum .    nevertheless , it is conceivable that this contamination could play a role , especially for the most disk - dominated objects .",
    "a precision measurement of this contribution will have to wait for high spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy , however we can get a sense of this effect by exploiting the available hst images .",
    "in fact , inclination plays a major role in determining the contribution of rotation to the unresolved line width . for a face on - disk",
    ", rotation does not contribute to the line width and therefore disk contamination is expected to bias towards lower stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge . for an edge - on disk , the unresolved velocity profile of the disk has width comparable to the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge because they are contrasting the same potential ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) profile , for an aperture equal to twice the effective radius and to twice the exponential length , the ratio between the second moment of the line of sight velocity and the velocity dispersion is @xmath71 . ]",
    "and therefore we could expect a smaller effect , or even an increase in velocity dispersion . for intermediate inclination objects , or for objects with no evidence of a disk ",
    "hereafter the intermediate / undefined sample  we can assume that disk contamination should introduce no bias in the velocity dispersion .",

    "as expected , for a given bh mass , face - on spiral galaxies have lower velocity dispersion than edge - on and intermediate / undefined galaxies .",
    "thus , it is possible that velocity dispersion of face - on galaxies are affected by cool stars with low velocity .",
    "if we exclude face on galaxies , the offset is found to be @xmath72 in bh mass ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively for face - on and intermediate / undefined galaxies ) , 0.17 dex smaller than that of the total sample .",
    "it is remarkable that even the edge - on sample shows an offset in the same direction as the total sample .",
    "the intermediate / undefined sample in particular should be the cleanest with respect to disk contamination and still shows an offset from the local relationship , although of course the error bar is larger due to the much reduced sample size .",
    "we conclude that disk contamination could reduce the offset by 0.17 dex , but not eliminate it .",

    "similarly , agn variability at the expected level of @xmath2320 - 30%  ( i.e @xmath230.05 - 0.08 dex ) is a negligible effect ( webb & malkan 2000 ) and its effect is already included in the overall estimate of the uncertainty of the bh mass from single - epoch data .      as mentioned previously , the geometry and kinematics of the broad - line clouds  which connect the observed broad line profile to the bh mass as m@xmath80 , where r@xmath39 is the distance to the broad - line clouds",

    "although we adopt this new calibration of the shape factor , the evolution of the m@xmath0 relation is _ independent _ of its numeric value  as long as it is constant with redshift  since the relative offsets among three redshift points in fig .",
    "[ fig_evolution ] are effectively bh mass ratios .",
    "if the assumption of constant shape factor is dropped , many different interpretations of our result become possible , including that the m@xmath0 relation is constant but the shape factor evolves by a factor of four between @xmath3 and today .",
    "unfortunately , direct measurement of bh masses around active galaxies at high - redshift are unlikely to become available in the near future , and therefore the shape factor can not be directly determined for the moment . however",
    ", we note that the local onken et al . sample is similar to our own in terms of bh mass , orientation ( i.e. both are seyfert 1s ) , and accretion rate ( woo & urry 2002 ; see below ) .",

    "for this reason , we will continue in our discussion assuming that the shape factor is constant , but the reader is cautioned to keep this caveat in mind .",
    "a final check concerns the mass accretion rate of the bhs .",
    "in fact , if the bhs were rapidly growing , this would need to be taken into account when comparing with the local relationship .",
    "for example , if the local relationship is the final destiny of our sample , velocity dispersions would need to grow more than 40% in the next 4 gyrs to compensate for the increased mass .",

    "it is possible that one or more of these sources of uncertainty are combining to enhance our measured evolution , but we consider it unlikely that the entire effect is due to a conspiracy of these sources of error ( summing all the possible contributions listed in   6 , we estimate that the total systematic uncertainty is 0.25 dex in bh mass ) .",
    "another option is that the ecpi bh masses are less accurate than expected , and possibly biased , depending on some still unknown additional parameters other than the h@xmath2 width and l@xmath79 .",
    "the tightness of our measured relation and other independent tests ( e.g. greene & ho 2005b ) are quite encouraging in this respect , but not yet conclusive .",
    "while we will continue our effort to increase the quality of our measurement in the distant universe , it is clear that much work remains to be done in the local universe .",

    ", selection effects also range from the trivial to the profound .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio requirements introduce a minimum threshold in luminosity . therefore ,",

    "we made some progress in this respect , increasing our completeness from 7/13 ( 54% ) to 14/20 ( 70% ) between our pilot study and the present one .",
    "we also have a selection effect against strong fe ii emission , since that complicates stellar velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "it has been speculated that fe ii correlates with high accretion rate ( boroson & green 1992 ) , so excluding fe ii emitters could bias us against fastly growing and hence possibly smaller bhs .",
    "for the same reason , local studies tend to use the near infrared ca ii triplet for stellar kinematics .",

    "it is plausible to imagine a scenario where the m@xmath55-@xmath56 relation is an evolutionary endpoint , rather than a time invariant property of all galaxies .",
    "for example , it is possible that only after a sufficient long time the amount of baryons that has been converted into stars  which mergers have relocated from the disk to the bulge  and the amount of baryons accreted by the central bh , will be constant fractions of the total amount available , and thus proportional to each other .",
    "however , the road to the m@xmath55-@xmath56 relation could be full of traumatic events such as gas - rich mergers , and during their life time galaxies could have roamed through the m@xmath64-@xmath56 plane ( e.g. kazantzidis et al .",
    "if we only measured the relation for well - behaved early - type galaxies  where stellar orbits are easy to measure and to model  we could artificially select the objects in their tight final correlation .",
    "if points on the m@xmath64-@xmath56 diagram were selected by their bh mass  as opposed to by the mass of the spheroid  we could imagine to find objects that lie above the end - point relation , if they existed .",
    "since our sample is effectively selected for having a massive bh , a selection effect of this sort could provide an explanation of our findings that is still in some sense `` evolutionary '' . in this respect , once again , the local samples of agns play a crucial role , being selected for their bh rather than for their bulge . by comparing our objects with the agns",
    "selected sample of onken et al .",
    "( 2004 )  instead of the tremaine et al.(2002 ) quiescent sample",
    " we are minimizing this sort of selection effect . ongoing work to extend the sample of agns with reverberation mapping bh masses ( peterson , 2005 , private communication ) and to obtain direct mass measurements for some of the same objects ( hicks 2005 ) is extremely important to improve the determination of the local m@xmath64-@xmath56 relation and its scatter .",
    "recent results could indicate that the relationship could have more scatter than imagined , especially at smaller masses ( peterson et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "\\3 ) cosmic evolution .",
    "this is probably the most surprising at first , given that the last 4 gyrs are in many respects a rather quiet phase of the life of the universe ( consider , e.g. , the sharp decline of the cosmic star formation rate since @xmath89 , lilly et al .",
    "however , evolution has been observed in the galaxy population , at least at masses comparable to those of the galaxies in our sample . in the velocity dispersion range covered by our sample , significant evolution and star formation is seen even in early - type galaxies ( treu et al .  2005a , b ; van der wel et al .",
    "2005 ; di serego alighieri et al .",
    "there is evidence that the morphological mix changed significantly in last @xmath155 gyr , both in the field ( bundy et al .",
    "2005 ) and in clusters ( dressler et al . 1997 ) . as far as agn hosts are concerned",
    ", recent studies show that the hosts of the most massive bhs have relatively old stellar populations , perhaps as old as those of massive quiescent ellipticals ( woo et al.2004 , 2005 ) , but little is known for smaller mass systems . if evolution were found to be much more recent for smaller mass system , this could be an indication of ` downsizing ' ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; treu et al .",
    "2005a ) for agn - hosts as well .",
    "general arguments have been given suggesting that the global accretion and star - formation history of the universe and the growth of bulges follow the growth of supermassive bhs ( merloni et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "more specifically , the real test of our result is provided by independent measures of the m@xmath55-@xmath56 relation .",
    "shields et al .",
    "( 2003 ) combines an [ ] -based estimate of the velocity dispersion with ecpi estimates of the bh mass to find a result consistent with no evolution out to @xmath14 .",
    "however , the scatter of their measurement ( i.e. @xmath15 0.5 dex in the offset from the m@xmath90 relation ) could soften the evolutionary constraints imposed on the relation . furthermore , as discussed in section  3.3 , for high(low)-luminosity quasars of shields et al .",
    "sample , stellar velocity dispersion could be over(under)estimated since [ ] line widths are systematically larger(smaller ) than stellar velocity dispersion with an increasing(decreasing ) function of eddington ratio ( greene & ho 2005a ) , possibly diluting any signature of evolution .",
    "furthermore , the mass and redshift range is completely different from our own , making it even harder to compare the two measurements .",
    "walter et al.(2004 ) combines co - based velocity dispersion with an ecpi based mass estimate for a system at @xmath91 , and finds evolution in the same sense as we do , although certainly this study is more comparable to that of shields et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in terms of mass and redshift range .",
    "another test is provided by studies of the relationship between bh mass and host galaxy luminosity or stellar mass for distant galaxies , which also find evidence for agns with smaller bulges than expected ( magain et al .",
    "2005 ; peng et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "one rationalization of our observations is that most galaxies are formed as a blue , star - forming , disk or irregular state and that this phase is terminated by a major merger .",
    "the consequences of this merger are threefold .",
    "firstly , there will be an onset of nuclear activity as gas , either present in the major partner or contributed by the minor partner , is driven into the accretion disk orbiting the major bh .",
    "this creates the type i seyfert galaxies in the state , as we observe them in our sample , where the mass supply rate is significantly lower than the eddington rate .",
    "secondly , the mass supply builds up to exceed the eddington rate and this leads to a powerful , disk - driven outflow which expels cool , interstellar gas ( silk & rees 1998 , blandford 1999 ) , and brings about the transition from the blue sequence to the red sequence , which has been postulated by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to occur at a characteristic mass which increases with redshift . in the model of hopkins et al .",
    ", the estimated transition stellar mass at @xmath3 is @xmath92 .",
    "this is consistent within the stellar luminosity of the galaxies in our sample ( we will revisit this point in paper ii ) .",
    "normally , dry mergers of spheroids do not change the velocity dispersion ( nipoti et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ; but see boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2006 for more general results ) . however , it is our conjecture that the combination of gas dynamical interaction between interstellar molecular clouds and an outflowing wind , as a short - lived dynamical phase , will lead to some dissipation within the stars and a consequent increase in the velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition , the direct transfer of stellar mass from the disk component of the merging galaxies to the spheroids could further boost the final bulge mass ( croton 2006 ) and hence its velocity dispersion .    the third phase may occur considerably later and involves three body interactions of three or more merging bhs in the center of the combined galaxy .",
    "this can lead to the ejection of some of the bh mass ( e.g. favata et al . 2004 , blanchet et al . 2005 , haehnelt , davis & rees 2006 , hoffmann & loeb 2006 ) , further lowering the m@xmath93 relation .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears that  at least qualitatively ",
    "dissipational mergers must play an important role in the later stages of assembly of spheroidals ( see also nipoti et al .",
    "2003 ; kazantzidis et al . 2005 ; roberston et al .  2005 ; treu et al .  2006 ;",
    "koopmans et al .",
    "2006 ) if evolution is the correct interpretation of our observations .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    \\1 ) we test the evolution of the m@xmath0 relation , by measuring stellar velocity dispersions with high s / n spectra for a sample of 14 seyfert 1 galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "bh masses are estimated using the h@xmath2 line width and the optical luminosity at 5100 , based on the empirically - calibrated photo - ionization method .",
    "\\2 ) we find a significant offset , @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) from the local relation of tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) from that of ferrarese ( 2002 ) , in the sense that velocity dispersions were smaller for given bh masses at this redshift .",
    "\\3 ) we investigate various sources of systematic errors , and find that those can not account for the observed offset . combining systematic errors of aperture correction ( @xmath860.15 dex in m@xmath55 ) , contamination from cold disk kinematics ( 0.17 dex ) , and stellar contamination to the optical luminosity at 5100  ( 0.1 dex ) , we estimate an upper limit to the systematic uncertainty of 0.25 dex in bh mass ( 0.06 in @xmath51 ) .",
    "\\4 ) along with two samples of agns at lower redshifts , we quantify the observed evolution with the best fit linear relation , @xmath98 with respect to tremaine et al . ( 2002 ) , and @xmath99 with respect to ferrarese ( 2002 ) , consistent with the scenario where the bh growth predates bulge assembly at these mass scales ( @xmath56=120220 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "\\5 ) we compare three measurements of the [ ] @xmath465007 line widths with the stellar velocity dispersions and find a scatter of @xmath1525% ( i.e 0.1 dex in @xmath56 , or 0.4 dex in m@xmath64 ) , and systematic offsets depending on the line fitting methods .",
    "these uncertainties must be accounted for when studying the evolution of the m@xmath93 relation , especially with a small sample .    in ",
    "7 we discussed three possible explanations for the observed offset : 1 ) systematic errors ; 2 ) selection effects ; 3 ) cosmic evolution .",
    "systematic errors are unlikely to account for the offset ( @xmath150.60 dex ) , which is significantly larger than the overall systematic uncertainty ( 0.25 dex )",
    ". selection effects could be present both in our sample ( selected against low luminosity agns and thus small bh masses ) , and in the local sample ( favoring more evolved systems ) , possibly resulting in the observed evolution of the m@xmath93 relation . in order to minimize selection effects",
    ", we compared our z=0.36 galaxies to the sample of local agns from the study of onken et al .",
    "the two samples are well matched in terms of host galaxy morphology , suggesting that morphological selection effects are not the dominant component .",
    "however , larger samples of agns with determined bh mass , stellar velocity dispersion , and host galaxy morphology are needed both locally and at high - redshift to improve the understanding of selection effects . finally , if cosmic evolution is the correct explanation , the observed offset would support earlier growths of supermassive bhs in galaxies with mass scales of @xmath8=170 km s@xmath9",
    ". this could be evidence for ` downsizing ' in the bh - galaxy coevolution i.e. more massive galaxies arrive at the local relationship early in time .",
    "this scenario can be further investigated with a sample of agn host galaxies with a range in mass at fixed redshifts .",
