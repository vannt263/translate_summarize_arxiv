    "a challenging problem in quantitative biology is to successfully model the evolutionary response of organisms to various environmental pressures . aside from its intrinsic interest , the development of models which can predict the time evolution of a population s genotype could prove useful in understanding a number of important phenomena , such as antibiotic drug resistance , cancer , viral replication dynamics , and immune response .",
    "perhaps the simplest formalism for modeling , at least phenomenologically , the evolutionary dynamics of replicating organisms is known as the quasispecies model @xcite .",
    "this model was introduced by manfred eigen in 1971 as a way to describe the _ in vitro _",
    "evolution of single - stranded rna genomes @xcite . in the simplest formulation of the model ,",
    "we consider a population of asexually replicating genomes , whose only source of variability is induced by point mutations during replication .",
    "we assume that each genome , denoted by @xmath5 , may be written as @xmath6 , where each `` base '' @xmath7 is drawn from an alphabet of size @xmath8 . with each genome",
    "is associated a first - order growth rate constant @xmath9 , which we assume to be genome - dependent , since different genomes are expected to be differently suited to the given environment .",
    "the set of all growth rate constants is termed the _ fitness landscape _ , which will generally be time - dependent .",
    "replication and mutation give rise to mutational flow between the genomes .",
    "if we let @xmath10 denote the number of organisms with genome @xmath5 , then , @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the first - order mutation rate constant from @xmath13 to @xmath5 . if @xmath14 denotes the probability that , after replication , @xmath13 produces the daughter genome @xmath5 , then clearly @xmath15 . to compute @xmath14 , we assume a per base replication error probability @xmath16 for genome @xmath5 ( different genomes may have different replication error probabilities , since some genomes may code for various repair mechanisms which other genomes do not ) .",
    "it is then readily shown that @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the hamming distance between @xmath5 and @xmath13 .    in order to model the relative competition between various genomes",
    ", it proves convenient to reexpress the dynamics in terms of population fractions . defining @xmath19 , and @xmath20",
    ", we obtain the system of equations , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and is therefore simply the mean fitness of the population .",
    "the above system of equations is physically realizable in a chemostat , which continuously siphons off organisms to maintain a constant population size @xcite .",
    "this ensures that growth is not resource limited , so the assumption of simple exponential growth is a good one .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that it is possible to introduce a death term which places a cap on the population size , without changing the form of the quasispecies equations .",
    "if we introduce a second - order crowding term ( logistic growth ) , so that , @xmath23 then if @xmath24 is genome - independent , it is readily shown that when converting to the @xmath25 the quasispecies equations are unchanged .",
    "the quasispecies equations may be written in vector form as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the vector of population fractions , @xmath28 is the matrix of first - order mutation rate constants , and @xmath29 is the vector of first - order growth rate constants . for a static fitness landscape ,",
    "eigen proved that @xmath30 evolves to the equilibrium distribution given by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of research on quasispecies theory has focused on the simplest possible fitness landscape , known as the _ single fitness peak _ ( sfp ) landscape @xcite . in the sfp model",
    ", there exists a single , `` master '' sequence @xmath32 for which @xmath33 , while for all other sequences we have @xmath34 .",
    "the sfp model assumes a genome - independent mutation rate , so that @xmath35 for all @xmath5 .",
    "the sfp landscape is analytically solvable in the limit of infinite sequence length .",
    "the equilibrium behavior of the model exhibits two distinct regimes : a localized regime , where the genome population clusters about the master sequence ( giving rise to the term `` quasispecies '' ) , and a delocalized regime , where the genome population is distributed essentially uniformly over the entire sequence space .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is known as the _ error catastrophe _ , and can be shown to occur when @xmath36 , the probability of correctly replicating a genome , drops below @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the error catastrophe is generally regarded as the central result of quasispecies theory , and it has been experimentally verified in both viruses @xcite and bacteria @xcite . indeed , the error catastrophe has been shown to be the basis for a number of anti - viral therapies @xcite .",
    "the structure of the quasispecies equations naturally lends itself to application to more complex systems than rna molecules .",
    "indeed , the model has been used to successfully model certain aspects of the immune response to viral infection @xcite . however , in their original form , the quasispecies equations fail to capture a number of important aspects of the evolutionary dynamics of real organisms .",
    "for example , it is implicitly assumed that each genome replicates _ conservatively _ , meaning that the original genome is preserved by the replication process .",
    "correct modeling of dna - based life must take into account the fact that dna replication is _ semiconservative _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of a genome - independent replication error probability is also too simple , since cells often have various repair mechanisms which may become inactivated due to mutations @xcite .",
    "in addition , eigen s model neglects the effects of recombination , transposition , insertions , deletions , and gene duplication , to name a few additional sources of variability .",
    "thus , a considerable amount of work remains to be done before a quantitative theory of evolutionary response is developed .",
    "nevertheless , some progress has been made .",
    "for example , semiconservative replication was recently incorporated into the quasispecies model @xcite .",
    "a simple model incorporating genetic repair was developed in @xcite .",
    "diploidy has been studied in @xcite , and finite size effects in @xcite .",
    "one area in which more realistic models need to be developed is in the nature of the fitness landscape .",
    "as mentioned previously , the most common landscape studied thus far has been the single fitness peak .",
    "however , genomes generally contain numerous genes ( even the simplest of bacteria , the mycoplasmas , have several hundred genes @xcite ) , which work in concert to confer viability to the organism .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we consider the behavior of the model for an arbitrary gene network .",
    "we assume conservative replication and a genome - independent error rate for simplicity , though we hypothesize at the end of the paper how our results change for the case of semiconservative replication .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the following section , we introduce our generalized @xmath0-gene model defining the `` gene network . ''",
    "we first give the quasispecies equations in terms of the population fractions of each of the various genomes .",
    "we proceed to the infinite sequence length equations , and then obtain a reduced system of equations which dictates the equilibrium solution of our model .",
    "we solve the model in section iii .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we include a simple example to illustrate how our solution method may be applied to specific systems .",
    "we go on in section iv to discuss the results and implications of our model , such as the relation to c.o .",
    "`` survival of the flattest '' @xcite , and also what our model says about the response of gene networks to mutagens .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v with a summary of our results and future research plans .",
    "consider a population of conservatively replicating , asexual organisms , whose genomes consist of @xmath0 genes . each genome @xmath5 may then be written as @xmath38 .",
    "let us assume , for simplicity , a `` single fitness peak '' landscape for each gene . that is , for each gene @xmath3 there is a `` master '' sequence @xmath39 for which the gene is functional , while for all @xmath40 the gene is nonfunctional .",
    "we assume that the fitness associated with a given genome @xmath5 is dictated by which genes in the genome are functional , and which are not .",
    "we let @xmath41 denote the fitness of organisms with genome @xmath5 such that @xmath42 for @xmath43 , while @xmath40 for @xmath44 ( we adopt the convention that @xmath45 when @xmath46 ) .    the choice of the landscape @xmath47 is arbitrary , so that the activity of the various genes in the genome are generally correlated .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 genes may be regarded as defining a gene network .",
    "we assume that the fitnesses are all strictly positive . without loss of generality ( i.e. , by an appropriate rescaling of the time ) , we may assume that @xmath48",
    ".    the simplest quasispecies equations for this @xmath0-gene model are obtained by assuming a genome - independent per base replication error probability @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that gene @xmath3 has a sequence length @xmath50 , and we define @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath52 , where , @xmath53 putting everything together , we obtain the system of equations , @xmath54    define the _ hamming class _ @xmath55 .",
    "also , define @xmath56 . by the symmetry of the landscape",
    ", we may assume that @xmath25 depends only on the @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath5 , and hence we may look at the total population fraction in @xmath58 and study its dynamics .",
    "the conversion of the quasispecies equations in terms of @xmath25 to @xmath59 is accomplished by a generalization of the method given in @xcite .",
    "the result is ,    @xmath60    we now let the @xmath61 in such a way that the @xmath62 and @xmath63 remain fixed .",
    "we assume that the @xmath64 are all strictly positive ( allowing an @xmath64 to be @xmath65 leads to certain difficulties which we choose not to address in this paper ) . because the probability of correctly replicating a genome is simply @xmath66 ,",
    "fixing @xmath67 is equivalent to fixing the genome replication fidelity in the limit of infinite sequence length .    in this limit , it is possible to show that , for each gene @xmath3 , the only terms in eq .",
    "( 8) which survive the limiting process are the @xmath68 terms @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that , in the limit of infinite sequence length , backmutations may be neglected .",
    "we also obtain that , @xmath69 and @xmath70    the final result is , @xmath71    it should be noted that the neglect of backmutations is only valid when one can group population fractions into hamming classes . in our case , by the symmetry of the fitness landscape , the equilibrium solution only depends on the hamming class , and hence , to find the equilibria , it is perfectly valid to `` pre - symmetrize '' the population distribution and study the resulting dynamics .    thus , when studying dynamics , it is generally not valid to neglect backmutations .",
    "for example , consider a single fitness peak landscape , and suppose that a population of organisms is at its equilibrium , clustered about the fitness peak . if the organisms are then mutated , so that they are shifted away from the fitness peak , then eventually they will backmutate and reequilibrate on the fitness peak ( this situation has been observed with prokaryotes @xcite ) .",
    "if we imagine that the mutation shifts the organism from the master genome @xmath32 to some other genome @xmath72 , then it is clear that the landscape is not symmetric about @xmath13 , and furthermore that the population distribution is not symmetric about @xmath32 .",
    "thus , eq . ( 11 ) does not apply . to correctly model the reequilibration dynamics",
    ", it is necessary to consider the finite sequence length equations , and explicitly incorporate backmutations .      because of the neglect of backmutations , eq . (",
    "11 ) may in principle be solved recursively to obtain the equilibrium distribution of the @xmath59 at any @xmath67 , assuming we know the equilibrium mean fitness , denoted @xmath73 .",
    "the problem , of course , is that @xmath73 needs to be computed .",
    "this may be done as follows : given any collection @xmath74 of indices , define @xmath75 via , @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and so forth .",
    "thus , @xmath75 is simply the total fraction of the population in which the genes of indices @xmath79 are faulty , while the remaining genes are given by their corresponding master sequences .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath75 is derived in appendix a. the result is given by ,    @xmath80    we can provide an intuitive explanation for this expression : because backmutations may be neglected in the limit of infinite sequence length , it follows that , once a gene is disabled , it remains disabled .",
    "therefore , given a set of indices @xmath81 , mutational flow can only occur from @xmath82 to @xmath83 for which @xmath84 ( in this paper , if @xmath85 , then @xmath86 is a proper subset of @xmath87 . if @xmath88 , then either @xmath89 is a proper subset of @xmath87 or @xmath90 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath82 can only receive mutational contributions from @xmath91 for which @xmath92 .",
    "for such a @xmath93 , the probability of mutation to @xmath81 may be computed as follows : because the genes corresponding to the indices @xmath94 remain faulty , the neglect of backmutations means that it does not matter whether these genes are replicated correctly or not .",
    "all genes with indices in @xmath95 must remain equal to the corresponding master sequences after mutation .",
    "the probability that gene @xmath3 replicates correctly is given by @xmath96 , so the probability that all genes with indices in @xmath95 replicate correctly is @xmath97 .",
    "the genes which must be replicated incorrectly are those with indices in @xmath98 .",
    "since each such gene replicates incorrectly with probability @xmath99 , it follows that the probability of replicating all genes in @xmath100 incorrectly is @xmath101 . putting everything together",
    ", we obtain a mutational flow from @xmath102 to @xmath103 of @xmath104 .",
    "summing over all possible @xmath105 gives us the expression in eq .",
    "( 13 ) .",
    "note that @xmath106 , so we need to solve eq .",
    "( 13 ) in order to obtain the equilibrium distribution of the model .",
    "in this section , we proceed to solve the reduced system of equations given by eq .",
    "since this provides us with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , it follows that we can recursively solve for the equilibrium values of all @xmath59 .    in vector notation ,",
    "( 13 ) may be expressed in the form , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the vector of all @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the vector of all @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is the matrix of mutation rate constants .    because of the neglect of backmutations in the limit of infinite sequence length , different regions of the genome space become mutationally decoupled , so that the largest eigenvalue of the mutation matrix @xmath114 will in general be degenerate .",
    "thus , the equilibrium of the reduced system of equations is not unique .",
    "however , for any initial condition , the system will evolve to an equilibrium , though of course different initial conditions will yield different equilibrium results .      in this subsection",
    ", we define a variety of constructs which we will need to characterize the equilibrium behavior of our model .",
    "we begin with the definition of a _ node _ : we define a _ level n node _ to refer to any collection of `` knocked out '' genes with indices @xmath74 .",
    "the reason for this terminology is simple .",
    "we may imagine the set of all nodes to be connected via mutations .",
    "because of the neglect of backmutations , it follows that a node @xmath79 is accessible from a node @xmath115 via mutations if and only if @xmath116 . the result is that we can generate a directed graph of mutational flows between nodes , an example of which is illustrated in figure 1 .    given some node @xmath117 ,",
    "define @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , @xmath119 may be regarded as the subgraph of all nodes which are mutationally accessible from @xmath120 .",
    "an example of such a subgraph is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "let @xmath121 denote any collection of nodes .",
    "then we may define @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , define @xmath123 .",
    "thus , @xmath124 is the set of all nodes in @xmath121 such that no node in @xmath121 is contained within the mutational subgraph of any other node in @xmath124 .",
    "figure 3 gives an example showing the construction of @xmath124 from @xmath121 .",
    "given some node @xmath79 , define @xmath125 .",
    "we then define @xmath126 . finally , given some @xmath67 , define @xmath127 .    with these definitions in hand",
    ", we are now ready to obtain the structure of the equilibrium solution at a given @xmath67 .",
    "we claim that @xmath128 . we prove this in two steps .",
    "first of all , we claim that @xmath129 for some node @xmath120 . clearly , because @xmath130 , it follows that at least one of the @xmath131 at equilibrium .",
    "let @xmath132 be a node of minimal @xmath133 such that @xmath134",
    ". then it should be clear that , at equilibrium , we have , @xmath135 which , since @xmath134 , may be solved to give @xmath136 .",
    "so now suppose that @xmath137 .",
    "then @xmath138 .",
    "such an equilibrium can never be observed because it is unstable . to see this , let @xmath139 denote a node for which @xmath140 .",
    "then from eq .",
    "( 13 ) we have , at equilibrium , that , @xmath141 and so @xmath142 .",
    "clearly , however , any perturbation on @xmath143 will push @xmath144 away from its equilibrium value .",
    "this equilibrium is therefore unstable , and hence , unobservable .",
    "note that since @xmath128 , it follows that the mean equilibrium fitness is a continuous function of @xmath67 .      to find the equilibrium solution of the reduced system of equations , we first need to determine which @xmath145 at equilibrium .",
    "to this end , we begin with the claim that , for @xmath146 , @xmath147 unless @xmath148 . for suppose there",
    "exists @xmath149 such that @xmath150 at equilibrium .",
    "then out of the set of all nodes which satisfy the above two properties , we may choose @xmath120 to be of minimal level .",
    "we claim that , for any @xmath151 , we have that @xmath152 , for otherwise it is clear that @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , by the minimality of the level of @xmath120 , it follows that @xmath154 whenever @xmath155 is a proper subset of @xmath120 .",
    "but then the equilibrium equation for @xmath156 gives @xmath157 , and so @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , @xmath159 .",
    "however , by assumption , @xmath160 , which means that @xmath161 contains nodes in @xmath162 which are distinct from @xmath120 . denote one of these nodes by @xmath163 .",
    "then at equilibrium we have , from eq .",
    "( 13 ) , that , @xmath164 which is clearly a contradiction .",
    "this establishes our claim .",
    "we now argue that our equilibrium solution may be found if we know @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
    "we claim that for any @xmath167 , we may write , @xmath168 where the @xmath169 , and for @xmath146 a given @xmath170 is strictly positive if and only if @xmath171 . the above expression then holds for all @xmath120 , since we simply take @xmath172 for @xmath173 .    we can prove the above formula via induction on the level of the nodes in @xmath174 . in doing so",
    ", we will essentially develop an algorithm for constructing the @xmath175 .",
    "so , let us start with @xmath176 , the minimal level nodes @xmath174 .",
    "then clearly @xmath166 , so that @xmath177 , hence the formula is correct for @xmath176 .",
    "so now suppose that , for some @xmath178 , the formula is correct for all @xmath179 such that @xmath180 . then for a level @xmath181 node in @xmath182 , denoted by @xmath183 ,",
    "we have , at equilibrium , that , @xmath184 now , if @xmath185 , then @xmath186 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath187 , so the equilibrium equation may be solved to give , @xmath188 note that @xmath189 . furthermore , if @xmath190 , then no proper subset of @xmath191 is in @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , @xmath193 , so @xmath194 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath195 , then since @xmath196 , it follows that @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , the sum in eq .",
    "( 20 ) is nonempty , hence , since the @xmath170 appearing in the sum are all strictly positive , it follows that @xmath198 .",
    "this implies that @xmath199 is strictly positive if and only if @xmath195 , which completes the induction step , and proves the claim .    for each @xmath200",
    ", we can define @xmath201 , and then define @xmath202 and @xmath203 . if , for each @xmath155 we also define @xmath204 , that is , the vector of all @xmath205 , and if we define @xmath206 , then we obtain , @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "note that the @xmath209 form a linearly independent set of vectors .",
    "therefore , if @xmath210 contains more than one node , then the equilibrium solution of the reduced system of equations is not unique , but rather is defined by the parallelipiped @xmath211 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the degeneracy in the equilibrium behavior follows from the neglect of backmutations in the limit of infinite sequence length .",
    "the various nodes in @xmath212 become mutationally decoupled in this limit , which can cause the largest eigenvalue of the mutation matrix @xmath114 to be degenerate . however , for _ finite _ sequence lengths , the quasispecies dynamics will always converge to a unique solution . in particular , if we start with the initial condition @xmath213 , then for finite sequence lengths we will converge to the unique equilibrium solution . because all nodes are mutationally connected in the infinite sequence length limit with this initial condition , we make the assumption that the way to find the infinite sequence length equilibrium which is the limit of the finite sequence length equilibria is to find the infinite sequence length equilibrium starting from the initial condition @xmath214 .",
    "this allows us to break the eigenstate degeneracy in a canonical manner .    in the appendices , we describe a fixed - point iteration approach for finding the equilibrium solution of the model . within this algorithm",
    ", we also use the initial condition @xmath214 as the analogous approach to the one above for finding the infinite sequence length equilibrium which is the limit of the finite sequence length equilibria .    finally ,",
    "the treatment thus far has been finding the equilibrium solution of the reduced system of equations for @xmath146 . the equilibrium solution for @xmath215",
    "is obtained by taking the limit of the @xmath146 solutions , so that @xmath216 .      from the previous development",
    "it is clear that the nodes in @xmath217 may be regarded as `` source '' nodes which dictate the solution . to understand how the solution changes with @xmath67",
    ", we therefore need to determine how @xmath217 depends on @xmath67 .",
    "we claim the following : that there exist a finite number of @xmath218 , which we denote by @xmath219 , where @xmath220 , for which @xmath221 contains distinct elements . in any interval @xmath222 , @xmath223 is constant , and may therefore be denoted by @xmath224 .",
    "the @xmath225 are all disjoint , and @xmath226 .",
    "we begin proving this claim by introducing one more definition .",
    "let @xmath227 denote the set of all sets of nodes , such that a collection of nodes @xmath121 is a member of @xmath228 if and only if @xmath229 contains distinct elements .",
    "note that since there are @xmath230 nodes , there are @xmath231 sets of nodes , hence @xmath227 consists of a finite number of elements .",
    "given some @xmath232 , we claim that @xmath233 for at most one @xmath234 . to show this , suppose that there exist @xmath235 for which @xmath236 .",
    "choose any two nodes @xmath79 , @xmath93 in @xmath237 , and note that @xmath238 , and similarly for @xmath239 .",
    "however , @xmath240 and @xmath241 implies that @xmath242 , so that @xmath243 and hence @xmath244 .",
    "therefore , @xmath245 and @xmath246 , so @xmath247 does not contain distinct elements . because this contradicts our assumption about @xmath237 , it follows that @xmath248 for at most one @xmath67 .",
    "so , since @xmath227 contains a finite number of elements , it follows that there are a finite number of @xmath67 for which @xmath249 satisfies the property that @xmath250 contains distinct elements .",
    "we can denote these @xmath67 by @xmath251 , where we assume that @xmath252 .",
    "note that if a collection of nodes @xmath121 has the property that @xmath253 , then @xmath121 must be a collection in @xmath227 .",
    "this is easy to see : @xmath121 contains some @xmath79 for which there exists a distinct @xmath254 where @xmath255 .",
    "therefore @xmath256 , which proves our contention .",

    "then they share at least one node , and so , by the nature of the two sets , we must have that @xmath303 .",
    "define @xmath304 to be @xmath305 for any node in @xmath224 , @xmath302 , and @xmath306 to be @xmath307 .",
    "now , @xmath308 contains some node @xmath309 such that @xmath310 for @xmath67 in @xmath311 .",
    "but if for @xmath312 we have that @xmath313 and @xmath314 , then @xmath315 and @xmath316 . since @xmath317 is monotone decreasing or increasing , it follows that @xmath318 on @xmath319 , or equivalently , @xmath320 .",

    "therefore , @xmath329 , so @xmath226 , as claimed .",
    "the various @xmath224 may therefore be regarded as defining different `` phases '' in the equilibrium behavior of the model .",
    "physically , each `` phase '' is defined by a set of `` source nodes , '' which dictate which genes in the genome are knocked out , and which are not .",
    "the transition from @xmath224 to @xmath330 corresponds to certain genes in the genome becoming knocked out , and perhaps other genes becoming viable again .",
    "this transition can happen more than once , and so we refer to the series of @xmath331 transitions as an `` error cascade . ''    because @xmath332 , for sufficiently large @xmath67 , @xmath333 for any @xmath334 .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath67 , @xmath335 .",

    "thus , the final transition from @xmath338 to @xmath339 corresponds to delocalization over the entire genome space , which is simply the error catastrophe .",
    "once we have determined @xmath73 , we can in principle obtain the population fractions @xmath59 in the various hamming classes .",

    "note then that instead of computing the @xmath402 , which will be @xmath65 as soon as any delocalization occurs , we first sum over a set of gene indices containing the delocalized genes as a subset , and only compute the population distribution for finite hamming distances of the localized genes .      in this subsection",
    ", we compute various localization lengths associated with the population distribution .",
    "specifically , given a node @xmath79 , and some @xmath403 , we define two localization lengths , @xmath404 and @xmath405 , as follows : @xmath406 note that , @xmath407 and so , in analogy with @xmath408 and @xmath75 , we have that , @xmath409 we also define the localization length @xmath410 by , @xmath411 note that @xmath412 , and so is finite if and only if all the @xmath413 are finite .",

    "first of all , we claim that @xmath418 if and only if @xmath419 .",
    "secondly , we claim that @xmath420 if and only if @xmath421 with @xmath422 for some @xmath423 .    to show this , note first of all that , from physical considerations , @xmath418 if @xmath419 .",

    "then if @xmath437 , it is clear from the expression for @xmath438 that @xmath439 for some @xmath440 , with @xmath441 . but this contradicts the minimality of @xmath442 , hence @xmath443 , so since @xmath429 , it follows that @xmath421 .",
    "this proves the converse , which establishes the second part of our claim .",
    "we now illustrate the theory developed above using a simple two - gene `` network '' as an example .",
    "we assume a genome containing two identical genes , so that @xmath444 , and we choose the following growth parameters : @xmath445 , @xmath446 , and @xmath447 .    with these parameters ,",
    "the system exhibits two localization to delocalization transitions .",
    "first , for @xmath448 we have @xmath359 . for @xmath449",
    "we have @xmath450 .",
    "the error catastrophe occurs at @xmath451 .",
    "we determined the equilibrium behavior of the model by solving the finite sequence length equations for @xmath452 and @xmath453 .",
    "the details may be found in appendix c. figure 4 shows a plot of @xmath107 from the simulation results and from our theory .",
    "figure 5 shows plots of @xmath454 , @xmath455 , @xmath456 , and @xmath457 from the simulation results and from theory .",
    "the first point to note about the solution of the quasispecies equations for a gene network is that , unlike the single gene model , which exhibits a single `` error catastrophe , '' the multiple gene model exhibits a series of localization to delocalization transitions which we term an `` error cascade . ''",
    "the reason for this is that as the mutation rate is increased , the selective advantage for maintaining functional copies of certain genes in the genome is no longer sufficiently strong to localize the population distribution about the corresponding master sequences , and delocalization occurs in the corresponding sequence spaces .",
    "the more a given gene or set of genes contributes to the fitness of an organism , the larger @xmath67 will have to be to induce delocalization in the corresponding sequence spaces .",
    "eventually , by making @xmath67 sufficiently large , the selective advantage for maintaining any functional genes in the genome will disappear , and the result is complete delocalization over all sequence spaces , corresponding to the error catastrophe .",
    "the prediction of an error cascade suggests an approach for determining the selective advantage of maintaining certain genes in a genome .",
    "currently , the standard method for determining whether a gene is `` essential '' is by knocking it out , and then seeing if the organism survives . by knocking out each of the genes",
    ", one can construct a `` deletion set '' for a given organism , consisting of the minimal set of genes necessary for the organism to survive @xcite .    while knowledge of the deletion set of an organism is important",
    ", it does not explain why the organism should maintain functional copies of other , `` nonessential '' genes .",
    "one possibility is that these `` nonessential '' do confer a fitness advantage to the organism , however , the time scale on which organisms are observed to grow during knockout experiments is simply too short to resolve these fitness differences .",
    "thus , an alternative approach to the deletion set method is to have organisms grow at various mutagen concentrations . by determining which genes get knocked out at the corresponding mutation rates , it is possible to determine the relative importance of various genes to the fitness of an organism . such an experiment is likely to be difficult to perform . nevertheless ,",
    "if successful , it would provide a considerably more powerful approach than the deletion set method for determining fitness advantages of various genes .",
    "the results in this paper also shed light on a phenomenon which c.o .",
    "wilke termed the `` survival of the flattest '' @xcite .",
    "briefly , what wilke ( and others ) showed was that at low mutation rates , a population will localize in a region of sequence space which has high fitness . at higher mutation rates",
    ", a population will relocalize in a region of sequence space which may not have maximal fitness , but is mutationally robust @xcite .",
    "the error cascade is exactly a relocalization from a region of high fitness but low mutational support to a region of lower fitness but higher mutational support .",
    "the reason for this is that the fitness landscape becomes progressively flatter as more and more genes are knocked out , because the more genes are knocked out , the smaller the fraction of the genome which is involved in determining the fitness of the organism .",
    "this implies that an error cascade is necessary for the `` survival of the flattest '' principle to hold .",
    "robustness in this sense is therefore conferred by modularity in the genome .",
    "that is , robustness does not arise because an individual gene may remain functional after several point - mutations , but rather arises from the fact that the organism can remain viable even if entire regions ( e.g. `` genes '' ) of the genome are knocked out ( it should be noted that the idea that mutational robustness is conferred by modularity in the genome has been discussed before @xcite ) .    to see this point more clearly , one can consider a `` robust '' landscape in which the genome consists of a single gene .",
    "however , unlike the single - fitness peak landscape , the organism is viable out to some hamming class @xmath458 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath459 , then @xmath34 if @xmath460 , otherwise @xmath461 , where @xmath462 . using techniques similar to the ones used in this paper ( neglect of backmutations and stability criterion for equilibria ) , it is possible to show that the equilibrium mean fitness is exactly @xmath463 , unchanged from the single - fitness peak results .",
    "thus , in contrast to robustness studies which consider finite sequence lengths and do not have a well - defined viability cutoff @xcite , in the limit of infinite sequence length there is no selective advantage in having a genome which can sustain a finite number of point mutations and remain viable .",
    "this paper developed an extension of the quasispecies model for arbitrary gene networks .",
    "we considered the case of conservative replication and a genome - independent replication error probability .",
    "we showed that , instead of a single error catastrophe , the model exhibits a series of localization to delocalization transitions , termed an `` error cascade . ''    while the numerical example we used in this paper was relatively simple ( in order to clearly illustrate the theory developed ) , it is possible to have nontrivial delocalization behavior , depending on the choice of the landscape .",
    "for example , it is possible that certain genes which are knocked out in one phase can become reactivated again in the following phase .",
    "that is , instead of a delocalization , one can have a _ re - localization _ to source nodes not contained in the mutational subgraphs of the source nodes in the previous phase .",
    "this implies that the @xmath156 can exhibit discontinuous behavior .",
    "the types of equilibrium behaviors possible is something which will be explored in future research .",
    "future research also will involve incorporating more details to the multiple - gene model introduced in this paper .",
    "for example , one extension is to move away from the `` single - fitness peak '' assumption for each gene .",
    "another natural extension is to study the equilibrium behavior of the multiple - gene quasispecies equations for the case of semiconservative replication .",
    "while this is a subject for future work , we hypothesize that many of the semiconservative results would be essentially unchanged from the conservative ones .",
    "thus , we claim that at equilibrium , we would still have that @xmath128 , only this time @xmath464 is computed by replacing @xmath465 with @xmath466 .",
    "we also claim that we would still have that @xmath210 define the `` source '' nodes of the equilibrium solution .",
    "indeed , we hypothesize that , for semiconservative replication , eq . ( 13 ) becomes , @xmath467    finally , another subject for future work is the incorporation of repair into our network model . in @xcite",
    "it was assumed that only one gene controlled repair . by assuming that several genes control repair , then , in analogy with fitness , we hypothesize that instead of a single `` repair catastrophe '' @xcite",
    ", we obtain a series of localization to delocalization transitions over the repair gene sequence spaces , a `` repair cascade . ''    this research was supported by the national institutes of health .",
    "the authors would like to thank eric j. deeds for helpful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we derive eq . ( 13 ) from eq . ( 11 ) . to this end ,",
    "define , @xmath468 we then have that , @xmath469    we now claim that , @xmath470 this can be proved by induction . for @xmath46 this statement is clearly true , since @xmath471 .",
    "suppose then , that for some @xmath472 , the statement is true for all @xmath473 .",
    "then we have , @xmath474 and so , @xmath475 now , for each set @xmath476 appearing in the sum , a given subset @xmath369 occurs only once .",
    "the @xmath442-element sets @xmath476 which contain @xmath369 as a subset must be of the form @xmath477 , where @xmath478 . therefore , there are @xmath479 distinct @xmath442-element sets which contain @xmath480 . rearranging the sum",
    ", we obtain , @xmath481 this completes the induction step , and proves the claim .",
    "we are almost ready to derive the expression for @xmath482 . before doing so",
