    "the doppler shift has been successfully used to understand the frequency shift generated by moving reflectors , such as a mirror @xcite , a moving grating  @xcite or a grating acousto - optic modulator @xcite . in many applications , diffraction gratings",
    "are typically operated at a fixed incidence angle ( and a fixed non - specular diffraction order ) .",
    "for instance grating spectrometers are used to split a polychromatic ray ( at a given incidence angle ) into several diffracted monochromatic rays which propagate in different directions ; the angle of the propagation direction depends on the frequency and can change very quickly with the frequency , near a wood anomaly . here",
    "we are interested in the problem of an observer who is watching a diffracted ray from a moving grating ( at a fixed non - specular diffraction order ) .",
    "since at any given time the observer s viewing angle has a fixed value , this problem can be seen as a reciprocal situation of the case where a single polychromatic ray is incident on a grating : here the observer can only see the diffracted fields which are propagating in a given direction ; the corresponding incident rays are coming from several different directions and are merged into a single diffracted ray ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : observation : angle : linear ] ) .",
    "the incidence angle of each incident ray is frequency - dependent and , again , can change rapidly with frequencies near a wood anomaly . in practice ,",
    "polychromatic continuous diffuse light ( e.g. , direct sunlight , diffuse skylight ) can readily provide a light ray with the required incidence angle .",
    "the doppler shift depends on the angle of incidence and the fact that the angle of incidence is frequency - dependent implies that , when the grating is moving , there is variability in the frequency shift experienced by each incident frequency .",
    "the main purpose of the current work is to investigate the properties of the doppler shift created by a moving grating under a frequency - dependent incidence angle .",
    "the angular dispersion of the incidence angle with respect to the frequency can be very high near a wood anomaly . as a consequence , the doppler dispersion relation ( i.e. , the observed frequency as a function of the incident frequency )",
    "can be expected to exhibit some interesting non - linear behavior .",
    "in particular , we will look for conditions which lead to the existence of a flat band .",
    "when a band of incident frequencies inside a flat band is doppler - shifted into a narrower band of observed frequencies ( spectral compression ) , from energy conservation , we can expect that the observer will perceive an increased intensity of the light diffracted by a moving grating compared to the light diffracted by a stationary grating .",
    "the properties of a grating in motion in polychromatic diffuse light can also be relevant to the study of natural diffraction gratings as they seem to be placed on surfaces designed to undergo oscillatory motion , for instance , the wings of butterflies , leaves and flowers of plants ( wind - induced oscillations ) .",
    "many species also display rapid cycles of movement of iridescent colors in ritualized dances during courtship , e.g. , bird - of - paradise  @xcite and peacock spider  @xcite .",
    "since the work of robert hooke  @xcite and isaac newton  @xcite , it is known that the iridescent colors from some animals and plant species are generated by grating structures , although the functional purpose of the oscillations of natural gratings is still not well understood  @xcite . for the numerical simulation of moving gratings , we will consider a grating geometry based on the periodic nanostructure found in the wing scales of a _ morpho rhetenor _ butterfly .",
    "our choice is motived by several reasons .",
    "first the blue nanostructure of the _ morpho rhetenor _ are one of the most studied butterfly nanostructures .",
    "this nanostructure can also be modelled as a one - dimensional diffraction grating , leading to a substantial reduction of the computer simulation time and memory usage .",
    "the _ morpho rhetenor _ is also well - known for its ability to produce a bright blue color ; for instance , in 1864 the english naturalist and explorer henry bates wrote that a _ morpho rhetenor _ butterfly flapping its wings in the sunlight can produce a blue flash that `` is visible a quarter of a mile off ''  @xcite and it has been reported that this flash can even be seen from a low - flying aircraft  ( * ? ? ? * see p. 218 ) .",
    "the relatively long range of visibility of the _ morpho _ butterfly wing flap is consistent with our prediction that the motion of a grating under sunlight can induce a strong reflection due to the spectral compression and so the grating model for the _ morpho rhetenor _ nanostructure is an appropriate example for a case study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section :",
    "angular : dispersion ] , we will analyze the angular dispersion of the incidence angle with respect to frequency . the properties of the doppler shift produced by a grating in a translational motion and a rotational motion will be investigated , respectively , in sections  [ section : translational : motion ] and [ section : rotational : motion ] .",
    "some numerical simulation results will be presented in section  [ section : numerical : simulations ] and a conclusion section will follow .    : for a given diffraction order @xmath0 , an observer looking at a point @xmath1 on the grating interface can see a diffracted light ( blue dashed arrow ) if its angle of diffraction @xmath2 is equal to @xmath3 .",
