    "we follow the precepts of the two - orientation coronagraphic psf - subtraction process described by ssh05 .",
    "we selected ten candidate psf stars with near - ir colors similar to hd 181327 .",
    "two of these were specifically programmed very bright psf calibration stars with no _ iras _ detected excess emission , hr 4748 ( j=5.52 mag ) and hip 7345 ( j=5.49 mag ) , each observed at a single field orientation using a full spacecraft orbit and yielding very high snr .",
    "eight other psf template candidates were selected from go 10177 survey targets that exhibited no evidence of scattered - light excesses from circumstellar dust .",
    "each of these eight stars were observed at two field orientations ( thus providing two psf templates each ) , but were much less deeply exposed than our psf calibration targets due to their lesser brightness and the detailed nature of the observing / integration time strategy for these targets .",
    "all 36 hd 181327-minus - psf template subtractions revealed an elliptical ring - like disk that rotated in the celestial frame , following the 299 difference in target orientation between the two hd 181327 observational visits ( e.g. , fig 1a  d ) .",
    "psf - minus - psf subtractions exhibited no such structures ( e.g. , fig 1e ) while in all cases rotationally invariant features due to instrumental scattering and diffraction remained fixed in the frame of the detector .",
    "the four images resulting from subtracting the hr 4748 and hip 4375 high snr reference psfs from each of the two images of hd 181327 ( differing in orientation 299 ) were of higher photometric efficacy than those obtained using the serendipitous `` ensemble '' of psfs derived from the go 10177 survey targets and , generally , were more devoid of azimuthally anisotropic high and mid spatial frequency artifacts arising from aliasing in imperfect psf - subtractions .",
    "the hd 181327 debris disk image , which we discuss in this paper , was created using these four psf - subtracted images .",
    "the four images were median combined with equal weight after alignment , rotation to a common orientation , and masking regions in individual images affected by diffraction spikes from the hst secondary mirror support structure ( see figure 1f ) . the final nicmos image , shown in figure 1f ( and 2a ) , and discussed in ",

    "two 5 s exposures were taken without the coronagraph in the f606w ( `` wide '' v - band ) filter .",
    "after a 0.5 s f502n acquisition exposure , the star was placed behind the 09 radius coronagraphic occulting spot and two 1235 s f606w exposures were taken .",
    "the acs images were calibrated by the _",
    "opus pipeline , and the two coronagraphic exposures were combined with cosmic ray rejection .      by suppressing the diffraction pattern of the occulted star ,",
    "the acs coronagraph reduces the surface brightness of the wings of the stellar psf by about a factor of 7  10 . as with nicmos ,",
    "an additional gain in image contrast can be achieved by subtracting the underlying stellar psf using a coronagraphic image of another occulted star of similar color reducing the remaining `` background '' by factors of 10  100 .",
    "additional information on acs coronagraphic performance is presented in   6.2 of @xcite .",
    "in the case of hd  181327 , observations of the f5v star hd  191089 were used to create a template psf image for subtraction .",
    "hd  191089 was imaged in a single spacecraft orbit immediately following the observations of hd  181327 , and a very similar imaging and data processing strategy was employed .",
    "two 6 s direct and two 1005 s coronagraphic ( r = 09 occulting spot ) exposures were obtained with the f606w filter .",
    "the hd  191089 psf template was scaled to the flux density of hd  181327 pixel@xmath21 ( full well depth of an hrc ccd pixel ) and added to the flux density measured within a 1@xmath8 radius aperture .",
    "charge in excess of a pixel full - well is transferred , without significant inefficiency , to neighboring non - saturated pixels . for additional information",
    "see @xmath23 4.2.6 and 4.3.1 of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . ] .",
    "after finite - aperture photometric and geometrical distortion corrections , the target - to - psf scaling obtained agreed within 2% of expected based upon the v - band magnitudes of the stars .",
    "the subtraction of hd  181327 was optimized by iteratively shifting and subtracting the flux - scaled hd  191089 image until residuals induced by mis - registration , beyond 2@xmath8 from the occulted star , were minimized and spatially symmetric .",
    "this process co - registers the stars to @xmath7 0.05 hrc pixels ( 1.25 mas ) .",
    "the final subtracted image ( shown in figure 3 at three different image scales and display stretches ) was corrected for the well - characterized geometric distortion in the hrc camera .",
    "near the coronagraphic obscuration , a residual halo of starlight unsuppressed by the acs coronagraph arises from instrumental scattering ( seen as radial streaks ) and diffraction by the occulter itself ( seen as concentric rings centered on the occulter ) .",
    "the scattered - light streaks are relatively insensitive to star - to - occulter positioning , but the ring - like diffracted light distribution is sensitive to the location of the star within the footprint of the occulter . the acs psf - subtracted image of hd  181327-minus - hd  191089 ( after flux - scaling and image registration ) shows instrumentally - induced residuals beyond the edge of the occulting spot .",
    "the residuals are dominated by diffraction rings arising , predominantly , from differences in the positioning of the two stars behind the occulter .",
    "the registration of the hd  181327 and hd  191089 images required a larger than typical translation ( 30.1 mas ) of the reference psf indicative of a target centration error in the acquisition process ( assuming the position of the occulting spot remained stable over the short period of the two - orbit sequential observations of both stars ) .",
    "the position error was much greater along the image horizontal ( w.r.t .",
    "the detector ) , so the psf - subtraction residuals are also larger along that direction . due to the asymmetry of the psf subtraction - residuals near the edge of the spot : ( _ a _ ) the hd  181327 disk can be detected reliably from 1@xmath24 from the star only within @xmath25 arcs centered on the image - y axis on opposite sides of the star ( figure 3a ) ; ( _ b _ ) from 2@xmath26 a diffuse halo is seen ( figure 3b ) , though its near circular - symmetry and ring - like substructures might implicate a residual contribution of instrumental origin ( from imperfect psf - subtraction ) that is somewhat difficult to quantify .",
    "further from the coronagraphic occulting spot , from 4@xmath27 9@xmath28 ( well beyond the distance leading to psf - subtraction artifacts discussed in ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) ) , within @xmath1 45@xmath2 of north a faint nebulosity with a mean surface brightness of v @xmath4 21.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 is seen ( figure 3c ) .",

    "we use the photometric measures derived from these observations , along with _ iras _ faint source catalog ( fsc ) 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath0 m photometry , to better define the thermal spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the hd 181327 disk ( see fig . 4 and table 2 ) . with these data",

    "the grains which are predominantly responsible for hd  181327 s thermal infrared excess may not be those which give rise to the circumstellar light scattered at 0.6 to 1.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "in the case of the debris system circumscribing hr  4796a @xcite , @xcite suggested a two - component dust population with large grains of ism - like composition ( moderately porosity amorphous silicates ) at the radius of the scattered - light disk , and high porosity crystalline grains close to the star . the thermal emission from hd  141569 s circumstellar disk was shown by @xcite to arise from within 1@xmath8 ( 100 au ) of the star from 12  21 @xmath0 m imaging , while light scattered by the disk at 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath0 m ( @xcite ; @xcite ) originates ( and extends ) significantly further out .",
    "while hd  181327 s thermal sed is not inconsistent with the possibility of ism like grains ( e.g. , @xmath115 @xmath4 -3.5 with _ a_@xmath114 @xmath3 1 @xmath0 m ; @xcite ) in the scattered - light debris ring , the presumption of a single population of hard , spherical , silicate grains would be inapplicable for grains which have grown ( evolved ) from ism - like structures , and may be spatially ( radially ) segregated in distance from the star .",
    "the inferred spatial distribution of dust detected about stars , from thermal infrared excesses ( as measured from _ iras _ and _ spitzer _ ) , often predicts central clearings or `` holes '' to explain the observed spectral energy distributions .",
    "scattered - light imagery of circumstellar debris directly provides constraints on the spatial distribution of dust independent of the dust grain temperature in regions sufficiently far from the central star which can be instrumentally probed with high spatial resolution .",
    "the central regions of dusty circumstellar disks that are nearly edge on to the line - of - sight ( e.g. , @xmath12 pictoris , au microscopii and hd  32297 ) remain hidden at optical and near - ir wavelengths due to the opacity of the dust .",
    "the inner regions of debris disk systems which are more inclined to the line - of - sight , such as hd  181327 , are revealed directly and give support to the interpretation of inner holes from analyses of debris disk seds .",
    "while only a very small number of light - scattered images of circumstellar debris disks exist , the growing number allows inter - comparison of the disk characteristics with stellar type and age ( when sufficiently constrained ; see table 3 and figure 15 ) . with the notable exception of @xmath124 psa , which thus far has only been observed in scattered light with _",
    "hst_/acs , all of the debris disks listed in table 3 have been observed with scattered - light imagery in the optical and the near - infrared .",
    "very recently , two newly discovered , scattered - light disks around older ( 0.3  1 gyr ) stars , hd  53143 and hd  139664 @xcite , have been reported , adding importantly to this still very limited sample .    of the debris disks imaged to date , the hr  4796a ring - like disk is , in many respects , morphologically most similar to hd  181327 s .",
    "both scattered - light disks appear as relatively narrow annuli , have similar near - ir scattering fractions and thermal ir excesses , and physically are of similar size ( 70 and 86 au in radii , respectively ) . both stars , while not coeval ( hr  4796a being a member of the tw hya association , and hd  181327 in the @xmath12 pictoris moving group ) are of similar ages ( @xmath7 10 myr ) , and spectral types .",
    "directionally preferential scattering , symmetrical about the disk minor axis ( i.e. , with respect to the line - of - sight ) , is seen in the hd  181327 disk .",
    "such non - isotropic scattering might be expected from circumstellar particles evolved from a primordial ism - like population ( comparable in size to , or larger than , the 1.1 @xmath0 m wavelength of the observation ) , and similar behavior is seen in the hr  4796a debris ring , and in @xmath124 psa s and hd  107146 s as well .",
    "these four ring - like debris disks vary by factors of @xmath7 2 in radius ( from the already noted smaller hr  4796a and hd  181327 to the larger hd  107146 ( 133 au ; @xcite ) and @xmath124 psa ( 145 au ; @xcite ) , and @xmath7 4 in ring width - to - radius ( w : r ) ratio ( from @xmath7 0.17 , for both hr  4796a @xcite and @xmath124 psa , to 0.64 for the very broad hd  107146 ring , and hd  181327 in between at 0.38 ) .",
    "the disks about hr  4796a and @xmath124 psa , both early a stars , are most disparate in radius but most similar in w : r ratios , suggesting a lack of simple scalability in ring geometries conflated ( if not determined ) instead by dynamical and kinematic processes in play .",
    "for example , in the case of hr  4796a , the outer radius of its disk may be truncated by the dynamical influence of its m - star companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sharp inner and more shallow outer edges of the illumination - corrected scattered - light radial profiles of hd  181327 ( fig . 7 ) and @xmath124 psa ( figure 3 of @xcite ) are remarkably similar , suggestive of similar clearing and/or confinement mechanisms for the disk grains .    the photocenter of the @xmath124 psa s dust ring is asymmetrically offset from the position of the central star . as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "such an asymmetry may implicate the existence of one ( or more ) planetary perturbers .",
    "the hr  4796a debris ring exhibits an @xmath7  20% sb asymmetry at the ring ansae at near - ir and optical wavelengths @xcite ( also seen in it s mid - ir thermal emission as reported by @xcite ) , with no photocentric offset in the position of the star relative to the ring ansae detectable in the scattered - light observations .",
    "such a non - axisymmetric sb asymmetry about the ring minor axis could also arise from a local enhancement ( or depletion ) in the dust density distribution due to perturbations from unseen , co - orbital , planetary - mass bodies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "though , alternative mechanisms , dependent upon the amount of residual gas in the system , could account for the ring structure itself ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ) without invoking planetary - mass companions .",
    "the hd  181327 ring morphology is bi - axially symmetric , centered on the star , and devoid of any readily apparent azimuthal sb anisotropies aside from those dependent upon scattering phase angle .",
    "such a ring structure could arise from gas drag in the absence of planets , though the gas - to - dust ratio in the hd  181327 disk is , currently , unknown .",
    "we have imaged a circumstellar debris disk about the @xmath7 12 myr old f5/f6v star and @xmath12 pictoris moving group member hd 181327 in 1.1  @xmath0 m and 0.6 @xmath0 m light scattered by the disk grains .",
    "our 1.1 @xmath0 m psf - subtracted nicmos coronagraphic observations reveal a bilaterally symmetric ring - like structure , 317 @xmath1 16 from face - on with a major axis pa of 107@xmath2 @xmath1 2@xmath2 east of north .",
    "we estimate the 1.1  @xmath0 m disk flux density in the region 12 @xmath3 _ r _ @xmath3 50 to be 9.6 @xmath1 0.8 mjy ( 0.17 % of the total stellar light ) with @xmath7 70% of the disk flux density contained within a 36 au wide annulus centered on the brightest zone at _ r _ = 86 au from the star , well beyond the blackbody characterized 22 au radius of the thermally emissive dust detected in the _ iras _ and _ spitzer_/mips bands .",
    "the scattered - light disk appears to be centrally cleared ( to within 12 of the star , which is the limiting region which can be effectively probed with our nicmos observations ) and centered on the star .    the surface brightness of the ring of debris - scattered light is well represented by a @xcite type scattering phase function with g@xmath5 = 0.3 . modeling the disk",
    ", we find a vertical scale height @xmath106 = 510% of the 87.6 au radius of the maximum surface density at that radius .",
    "the observed dust ring explains the thermal ir excess emission above the stellar photospheric level measured by _",
    "iras _ and _ spitzer _ provided that @xmath125 m with a grain size distribution @xmath126 , presuming hard , spherical , silicate grains . with these grain parameters , and surface density profiles derived by direct inversion of the sb profiles obtained from the nicmos imagery , we infer a total dust mass of @xmath4 4 m@xmath11 ( @xmath4 0.05 m@xmath94 ) in the collision - dominated ring .",
    "such grains , however , fail to reproduce the g@xmath5 = 0.3 scattered - light asymmetry factor , suggestive of a more complex ( possibly mixed ) population of disk grains . to better constrain the possible grain sizes and their radial distributions , in _ hst _ cycle 15",
    "we will obtain 2 @xmath0 m coronagraphic imaging polarimetry observations with nicmos ( a new , recently enabled , observing mode ; @xcite ) of the hd 181327 disk ( go program 10847 ) .",
    "additional circumstellar light is seen from 24  ( 100200au ) in both 1.1 @xmath0 m nicmos and 0.6 @xmath0 m acs imagery declining in sb as @xmath7 _ r_@xmath85 in both bands . the sb profile beyond 100",
    "au is consistent with the blow - out time scale for grains in the inner disk by radiation pressure , collisional grains with a size distribution as discussed , and low gas pressure in the disk .",
