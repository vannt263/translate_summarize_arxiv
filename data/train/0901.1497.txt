    "the main goals of reactor neutrino experiments are to detect @xmath3 oscillation and precisely measure the mixing angle of neutrino oscillation @xmath4 .",
    "the experiment is designed to detect reactor @xmath5 s via the inverse @xmath6-decay reaction    @xmath7 .",
    "the signature is a delayed coincidence between @xmath8 and the neutron captured signals . in the paper , only three important sources of backgrounds are taken into account and they are the uncorrelated background from natural radioactivity and the correlated backgrounds from fast neutrons and @xmath0he/@xmath1li .",
    "the backgrounds like the neutrino events consist of two signals , a fast signal and a delay signal .",
    "it is vital to separate neutrino events from backgrounds accurately in the reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "bayesian neural networks ( bnn)@xcite are algorithms of the neural networks trained by bayesian statistics .",
    "they are not only non - linear functions as neural networks , but also controls model complexity .",
    "so their flexibility makes them possible to discover more general relationships in data than traditional statistical methods and their preferring simple models make them possible to solve the over - fitting problem better than the general neural networks@xcite .",
    "bnn have been used to particle identification and event reconstruction in the experiments of the high energy physics , such as ref.@xcite .",
    "the application of bnn to discriminate neutrino events from backgrounds in reactor neutrino experiments has been described in ref.@xcite . in the paper , bnn",
    "are also used to identify neutrino events in the signal region@xcite in reactor neutrino experiments , but the numbers of photoelectron received by pmts are used as inputs to bnn , not the reconstructed energy and position of events .",
    "the idea of bnn is to regard the process of training a neural network as a bayesian inference .",
    "bayes theorem is used to assign a posterior density to each point , @xmath9 , in the parameter space of the neural networks .",
    "each point @xmath9 denotes a neural network . in the methods of bnn , one performs a weighted average over all points in the parameter space of the neural network , that is , all neural networks .",
    "the methods are described in detail in ref.@xcite . the posterior density assigned to the point @xmath9 , that is , to a neural network ,",
    "is given by bayes theorem    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a set of input data which corresponds to a set of target @xmath12 .",
    "the likelihood @xmath13 can be obtained by using a training sample . and",
    "a gaussian prior is specified for each weight using the bayesian neural networks package of radford neal .",
    "given an event with data @xmath14 , an estimate of the probability that it belongs to the signal is given by the weighted average    @xmath15    currently , the only way to perform the high dimensional integral in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is to sample the density @xmath16 with markov chain marlo carlo ( mcmc ) methods@xcite . in mcmc methods ,",
    "one steps through the @xmath9 parameter space in such a way that points are visited with a probability proportional to the posterior density , @xmath17 .",
    "points where @xmath17 is large will be visited more often than points where @xmath17 is small .",
    "( 2 ) approximates the integral using the average    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the number of points @xmath9 sampled from @xmath17 .",
    "each point @xmath9 corresponds to a different neural network with the same structure .",
    "so the average is an average over neural networks , and the probability of the data @xmath14 belongs to the signal .",
    "the average is closer to the real value of @xmath20 , when @xmath19 is sufficiently large .",
    "in the paper , a toy detector is used to simulate central detectors in the reactor neutrino experiments , such as daya bay experiment@xcite and double chooz experiment@xcite , with cern geant4 package@xcite .",
    "the toy detector is the same as ref.@xcite .",
    "a total of 366 pmts are arranged in 8 rings of 30 pmts on the lateral surface of the oil region , and in 5 rings of 24 , 18 , 12 , 6 , 3 pmts on the top and bottom caps .",
    "the responses of neutrino events and backgrounds deposited in the toy detector are simulated with geant4 .",
    "although the physical properties of the scintillator and the oil ( their optical attenuation length , refractive index and so on ) are wave - length dependent , only averages@xcite ( such as the optical attenuation length of gd - ls with a uniform value is 8 meter and the one of ls is 20 meter ) are used in the detector simulation .    according to the anti - neutrino interaction in detectors of the reactor neutrino experiments@xcite , a neutrino event is uniformly generated throughout gd - ls region ( see fig .",
    "a uncorrelated background event is generated in such a way that a @xmath21 event generated on the base of the energy distribute of the natural radioactivity in the proposal of the day bay experiment@xcite is regarded as the fast signal , a neutron event of the single signal is regarded as the delay signal , its delay time is uniformly generated from 2 @xmath22s to 100 @xmath22s and the positions of the fast signal and the delay signal are uniformly generated throughout gd - ls region . a fast neutron event is uniformly generated throughout gd - ls region and its energy",
    "are uniformly generated from 0 mev to 50 mev , therein an event of two signals are regarded as a fast neutron background event .",
    "since the behaviors of @xmath0he/@xmath1li decay events in detectors could nt be simulated by the geant4 package , a @xmath0he/@xmath1li event is generated in such a way that the neutron signal from a fast neutron event is regarded as its delay signal , an electron event generated at the same position as the fast neutron event on the base of the energy distribute of @xmath0he/@xmath1li events in the proposal of the day bay experiment@xcite is regarded as its fast signal in the paper .",
    "energies and positions of neutrino events and backgrounds are reconstructed by the method in ref.@xcite .",
    "the signal region is determined by using the reconstructed energies and positions , as well as the neutron delay time(described in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "choosing inputs to bnn is vital to identify neutrino events .",
    "the reconstructed energies , the distance between reconstructed the positions of neutron and positron and the neutron delay time were used as inputs to the bnn method in ref.@xcite , but the energies and the distance are both the reconstructed physics variables , and they make bnn discriminations worse because of their reconstruction uncertainties .",
    "so we try to use raw data as inputs to bnn . obviously , the numbers of photoelectrons received by 366 pmts are rawer than the reconstructed variables .",
    "an event consists of two signals ( a fast signal and a delay signal ) , so if the numbers of photoelectron received by pmts will be directly used as inputs to bnn , bnn will have 732 inputs at least .",
    "it will take too much time to run a bnn program in a general computer because of such many inputs .",
    "the method of reducing inputs to bnn in the paper is that the photoelectrons received by several neighboring pmts are added up .",
    "that is several neighboring pmts incorporate a pmt patch . in the paper ,",
    "a pmt patch is a 3(azimuth direction)@xmath234(z direction ) pmts array on the detector lateral surface or a 120@xmath24 sector(including 21 pmts ) on the detector top and bottom caps .",
    "the delay time between two signals is very important to discriminate neutrino events from the uncorrelated background , so the number of photoelectrons received by a patch is multiply by the delay time , and the result is used as the inputs to all neural networks , which have the same structure .",
    "then all the networks have a input layer of 52 inputs , the single hidden layer of fifteen nodes and a output layer of a single output which is just the probability that an event belongs to the neutrino event .",
    "discriminating neutrino events from backgrounds is actually a binary response problem , that is the target is 1 or 0. neutrino events are labeled by t=1 , and background events are labeled by t=0 .",
    "so the output of bnn has to be a number between 0 and 1 .",
    "if the output is less than 0.5 , the event is regarded as a background event , and if the output is larger than 0.5 , the event is regarded as a neutrino event .",
    "a markov chain of neural networks is generated using the bayesian neural networks package of radford neal , with a training sample consisting of neutrino events and background events .",
    "one thousand iterations , of twenty mcmc steps each , are used .",
    "the neural network parameters are stored after each iteration , since the correlation between adjacent steps is very high .",
    "that is , the points in neural network parameter space are saved to lessen the correlation after twenty steps here .",
    "it is also necessary to discard the initial part of the markov chain because the correlation between the initial point of the chain and the point of the part is very high .",
    "the initial three hundred iterations are discarded here .",
    "it takes about 120 hours to run 1000 iterations on a computer with two 3.4ghz intel pentium d processors ( only one of which are used ) .",
    "neutrino identification efficiencies are defined by the ratios between the number of the events in neutrino test sample regarded as neutrinos and the number of neutrino test sample .",
    "background identification efficiencies are defined by the ratios between the numbers of the events in background test samples regarded as background events and the numbers of background test samples .",
    "the identification efficiencies are measured with the test sample which is different from the training sample .",
    "other 3000 events each of the neutrino and the three backgrounds are used to test the identification capability of the trained bnn . in the paper ,",
    "bnn are trained by the different training samples , which consist of neutrinos and three backgrounds at different rates , since the different identification efficiencies are obtained using those bnn .",
    "as tab . 1 shows , most neutrino events , uncorrelated background events and @xmath0he/@xmath1li background events in the signal region can be identified using the bnn method in the paper , but only a small part of fast neutron background events can be identified using the bnn method in the paper . since most fast neutron events ca nt be discriminate from neutrino events using the bnn method in the paper , neutrino discriminations are concerned with neutrino rates in training samples , as well as ratios of neutrino events and fast neutron events in training samples .",
    "the neutrino discrimination in the signal region increases from 90.5% to 93.7% with the increase of the neutrino rate from 50.0% to 57.1% in the training sample using the bnn method in the paper . and",
    "the neutrino discrimination also increases from 90.5% to 94.1% with the increase of the ratio of neutrino events and fast neutron events from 2:1 to 3:1 in the training sample . the different background to signal ratios in the signal region",
    "are obtained using the bnn trained by the training samples consisting of neutrino events and background events at different rates in the reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "neutrino events are discriminated from fast neutrons and @xmath0he/@xmath1li events via their fast signals identification , that is positron signals from neutrino events are separated from recoil proton signals from fast neutrons and electron signals from @xmath0he/@xmath1li events .",
    "@xmath21 signals induced by positrons and recoil protons are closer to point sources , but @xmath21 signals induced by electrons are closer to line sources .",
    "there is an effect on the distribution of photoelectrons over all the pmts in the detector due to the difference between a point source and a line source .",
    "the effect can be extracted from the inputs by the bnn method in the paper .",
    "so neutrino events can be better discriminated from @xmath0he/@xmath1li events using the bnn method in the paper , but distinguishing between neutrinos events and fast neutrons becomes worse using the bnn method in the paper .",
    "the events in the signal region can be identified using bnn one by one , once those bnn are trained by training samples . if the bnn method in the paper is used to the reactor neutrino experiments , the background to signal ratios will be changed .",
    "we only roughly estimate the changes here .",
    "we assume that the uncorrelated background fraction in the signal region is @xmath25 , the fast neutrons background fraction in the signal region is @xmath26 , and the @xmath0he/@xmath1li background fraction in the signal region is @xmath27 in the reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "those background fractions are very low ( for example , they are < 0.2% , 0.1% , 0.3% in one of the near detector claimed by the proposal of the daya bay experiment@xcite , respectively ) . if neutrino events are discriminated from background events using the bnn method in ref.@xcite , the background to signal ratios can reach 0.2*(a / n ) , 0.68*(f / n ) and 0.66*(l / n ) , respectively .",
    "if the efficiencies of the first column in tab .",
    "1 are use to the estimation , we get the result of the identification using the bnn method in the paper :    uncorrelated background / signal=(a / n)*(1 - 0.983)/0.941=0.018*(a / n )    fast neutrons background / signal=(f / n)*(1 - 0.293)/0.941=0.751*(f / n )    @xmath0he/@xmath1li background / signal=(l / n)*(1 - 0.913)/0.941=0.092*(l / n )    as the above equations show , the uncorrelated background to signal ratio and @xmath0he/@xmath1li background to signal ratio in the signal region are significantly improved using the bnn method in the paper in comparison with the bnn method in ref.@xcite . and the fast neutron background to signal ratio is a bit larger than the one in ref.@xcite .",
    "but the fast neutron fraction in the signal region is lower than the ones of the uncorrelated background and @xmath0he/@xmath1li background , so the total background to signal ratio using the bnn method in the paper is much lower than the one in ref.@xcite . in a word , the bnn method in the paper",
    "can be applied to discriminate neutrino events from background events better than the bnn method in ref.@xcite and the method based on the cuts in reactor neutrino experiments .",
