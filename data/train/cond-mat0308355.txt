    "since the computer experiment of fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) @xcite , many theoretical and numerical investigations followed to explain the unexpected results of the experiment @xcite - @xcite .",
    "what one expected according to a theorem of poincar @xcite and a theorem proved by fermi @xcite himself in his youth , and what was instead observed , has been narrated in several papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) in which various aspects of the experiment have been analysed in the framework of the kam theorem @xcite , ergodic problem @xcite , statistical mechanics and chaotic behaviour of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that , for a periodic fpu-@xmath0 chain with an even number of oscillators , an initial condition with only a set of excited modes , all having even ( resp .",
    "odd ) indices only , can not lead to the excitation of modes having odd ( resp .",
    "even ) indices .",
    "this means that , if one considers the set of all modes partitioned in the two subsets of the even and odd modes , an initial excitation , completely contained in one of the two subsets , can not propagate to the other .",
    "there are also other partitions .",
    "for example , partitions exist for which a subset contains one mode only @xcite .",
    "more specifically , for each of the modes @xmath4 ( of course when @xmath3 has the divisibility property required for @xmath5 in ( [ eq : nnnnn ] ) to be an integer ) one has that , if only one of these mode is initially excited , it remains excited without transferring energy to any other mode .",
    "an important problem is obviously the stability of these one mode solutions ( oms s ) , since it is reasonable to expect some relation between the loss of their stability and the onset of chaos in the system . in some sense",
    ", the destabilization of the simplest nonlinear modes can provide an `` upper bound '' estimate for the onset of the large scale chaos .",
    "the analysis of the stability of a generic oms is very difficult from a mathematical point of view . only for the case @xmath6",
    "there are analytical results ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which estimate the threshold energy density for the mode to become unstable .",
    "in fact the mode @xmath6 is the simpler one , since the different components of the perturbation , in modal space , are all decoupled and are described by a single lam equation .    in this paper",
    "we numerically revisit the problem of stability of the oms s and we present the results of a global analysis .",
    "we made a numerical study of the stability of the oms s as a function of the number @xmath3 of particles and of the product @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the energy density and @xmath1 is the parameter of nonlinearity in the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the analysis is based on the numerical integration of the full nonlinear fpu model .",
    "no external perturbation is considered for the oms , the only perturbation being that introduced by computational errors in numerical integration of motion equations .",
    "this simple method works very well : the results obtained confirm previous results obtained with a linear analysis of the problem of the stability(@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and clarify the dynamics with which a nonlinear one - mode exchanges energy with the other linear modes , with increasing energy densities .",
    "we have found that , in a large range of initial excitation energy density , the energy of the oms s keeps constant for very long times , and for short times it is partially transferred to other linear modes ; furthermore the oms s corresponding to the two values @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the oms s corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath11 have the same stability properties .",
    "the fpu system is a one - dimensional chain of oscillators ( with unit mass ) , with weakly nonlinear nearest - neighbour interaction .",
    "the nonlinear forces considered are quadratic , cubic and broken linear ones . in the present work we consider only the fpu-@xmath0 model ( nonlinear cubic forces ) , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "calling @xmath12 and @xmath13 the coordinates and the momenta of the oscillators , the model is defined by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath14    being    @xmath15    @xmath16    with @xmath17 .",
    "if we introduce the normal coordinates @xmath18  and   @xmath19 of the normal modes through the relations :    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    the harmonic energy of mode @xmath23 is : @xmath24    where , in the case of periodic boundary conditions ,    @xmath25    we have @xmath26 , so that there are only @xmath27 different frequencies ( if we assume @xmath3 even , for simplicity ) .    from ( [ eq : h0 ] - [ eq : h1 ] ) , the hamilton equations are obtained in the variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which , integrated by standard methods , allow to calculate the normal modes and the energy of each mode .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath30 . in this case",
    "all normal modes oscillate independently one from another and their energies @xmath31 are constants of motion .    in the anharmonic case ( @xmath32 ) , the normal modes are not independent and the variables @xmath18 have not simple sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "all the modes are coupled and the differential equation for the @xmath23-th mode is @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the generalized force in normal coordinate space , given by :    @xmath35    and    @xmath36    being @xmath37 for @xmath38 , if @xmath39 is a positive integer , and @xmath40 otherwise .",
    "the nonlinear one - mode solutions correspond to the values of @xmath5 :    @xmath41    from ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : c ] ) , one deduces @xcite that , if only one of these modes is initially excited , it remains excited without transferring energy to any other mode . in this case , the equation of motion for the excited mode amplitude @xmath42 is :    @xmath43    if we assume that at time @xmath44  @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the solution of ( [ eq : q2p ] ) is : @xmath47    where @xmath48 and the modulus @xmath23 of the jacobi elliptic function @xmath49 both depend on a :    @xmath50    @xmath51    with @xmath52 .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : cn ] ) is periodic with period @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "the energy of the mode is : @xmath55 in the next section , the problem of the stability of the oms corresponding to @xmath6 will be analysed .",
    "the stability properties of the nonlinear mode @xmath56 was studied analytically some years ago . in @xcite , the nonlinear mode @xmath56",
    "was named `` the out of phase mode '' .",
    "this expression derives from the fact that from ( [ eq : qk ] ) and the properties of @xmath57 one has , if the only excited mode is the mode @xmath56 : @xmath58 and then :    @xmath59    in @xcite , the stability analysis of the out of phase mode ( mode @xmath56 ) starts from the equations of motion for the variables @xmath60 . due to the relations ( [ eq : q - q ] )",
    ", these equations reduce to a single equation , describing the anharmonic oscillations of each particle , whose solution is the jacobi elliptic cosine function .",
    "perturbing this solution , and passing to normal modes variables @xmath61 one obtains a lam equation .",
    "the stability of the solutions of this equation , which is an example of hill s equation , and then the stability of the mode @xmath56 , is studied with the floquet theory .",
    "a numerical analysis shows that the first mode which becomes unbounded , as energy density increases , is the mode @xmath62 .",
    "a simple approximate formula , valid for large @xmath3 and @xmath63 and derived approximating the hill s matrix with a @xmath64 matrix , gives for the threshold energy density :    @xmath65    the problem of stability of the mode @xmath56 was also tackled in @xcite , in connection with the study of tangent bifurcation of band edge plane waves in nonlinear hamiltonian lattices . in the limit of large @xmath3",
    ", the formula @xmath66 is derived for the bifurcation energy density corresponding to the threshold energy density .",
    "this result is slightly different from the result ( [ eq : et ] ) and the small difference is probably due to the rough estimate of the eigenvalue spectrum of the hill s matrix in @xcite .",
    "@xmath72    from ( [ eq : tria ] ) and ( [ eq : qkp1 ] ) we obtain : @xmath73 .",

    "is reduced to a mathieu equation , by approximating the @xmath94 by its first - order fourier expansion . after a further time rescaling @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , with modulus @xmath23 ,",

    "for each fixed @xmath105 , which corresponds to fix a ratio @xmath92 , changing @xmath104 , namely @xmath0 , one can trace a curve in the @xmath106 parameter plane .",
    "a stability transition happens if this curve intersects characteristic curves separating stable from unstable regions for the mathieu equation .",
    "the main results of the stability analysis reported in @xcite are :    \\a ) for each mode having @xmath107 , there is a threshold value of @xmath0 for instability . above this threshold the nonlinear mode @xmath6 presents an instability causing growth of the mode corresponding to @xmath105 , through parametric resonance ;    \\b ) on the contrary , modes with @xmath108  ( i.e. @xmath109 )  are always stable in the linear approximation , for any energy density of mode @xmath6 , so that , perturbations of this mode involving only modes with @xmath108 never lead to instability .",
    "these modes , as well as modes with @xmath107 , when the product @xmath7 is less than the critical value , can grow only if they are triggered by the interaction with other modes that are unstable ;    \\c ) for @xmath110 there are always modes with @xmath107 so that the mode @xmath56 can never be stable for all energy densities . since the threshold value of @xmath0 is a decreasing function of @xmath105 , the first modes to go unstable , when @xmath7 is increased from zero , are the modes  @xmath111   and  @xmath112 ,  which have @xmath113 . therefore , for each ( even ) number @xmath3 of particles , there is a non - zero value of @xmath0 , function of @xmath3 , below which the nonlinear mode @xmath56 is stable .",
    "since the critical value tends to zero for @xmath114 , the critical threshold for the stability approaches zero as the number @xmath3 of particles is increased without limit ;    \\d ) using power series expansion of the various previous formulas , one obtains , for the critical value of threshold , the formula :    @xmath115    which confirms the @xmath116 dependence found in @xcite and in @xcite and the numerical values @xmath117 of the coefficient of @xmath118 found in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our numerical analysis of the stability of the one - mode solution corresponding to @xmath6 , as a function of the product @xmath7 and of the number @xmath3 of particles , based on the numerical integration of the full nonlinear fpu model directly in the variables @xmath60 , @xmath119 .",
    "more precisely , we integrate the equations of motion in the variables @xmath120 by means of a bilinear symplectic algorithm of the third order , which has been adapted from an algorithm employed previously by casetti @xcite . initial conditions for the variables @xmath120 are obtained in the following way .",

    "the instability of the oms can also be seen from another point of view , by considering the hamiltonian variables @xmath60 .",

    "[ fig : coor1 ] , as an example , we report the sum @xmath159 as a function of time .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the instability ( sum of the two coordinates different from zero ) appears when the mode @xmath153 starts to exchange energy with the other modes .    in this context , and to obtain more insight in the behaviour of oms , it is really very interesting to see what are the positions of particles in the chain , i.e. the spatial configuration of the chain , in correspondence of a well determined value of energy of the oms . in figs [ fig :",

    "we have seen that , for large values of @xmath3 , formula ( [ eq : beta ] ) gives a good estimate of the instability threshold , so we could try to explain the `` intermittent behaviour '' of the second regime in the framework of the theory developed in @xcite . as we have seen in section ( 4 ) ,",
    "modes with @xmath108 , are always stable in the linear approximation , for any energy density of the mode @xmath6 , so that , perturbation of this mode , involving only modes with @xmath108 , never leads to instability .",
    "let us consider for example the case @xmath138 .",
    "we have , from ( [ eq : rho ] ) , that the modes with @xmath194 are always stable in the linear approximation , for any energy density of mode @xmath195 .",
    "these modes can grow only if they are triggered by the interaction with other unstable modes . as is pointed out in @xcite , this kind of interaction",
    "is neglected in the linear approximation and comes into play only when unstable modes have grown and the linearized theory is no longer valid .",
    "this indirect triggering is evident in the figs .",
    "[ fig : ener1s ] - [ fig : enerq6 ] , where the time evolutions of the modes @xmath153 and @xmath196 are compared .",
    "no triggering of the mode @xmath196 exists , if @xmath193 .    for @xmath197 , in the short time intervals ,",
    "during which the nonlinear one - mode exchanges energy with the other modes , the time derivative of the energy of the oms is not zero and the equation ( [ eq : q2p ] ) and the formula ( [ eq : en ] ) are no longer valid . during these time intervals , a strong coupling exists between the mode @xmath56 and the two adiacent modes and , indirectly , with all the other linear modes . however , the exact mechanism by which the nonlinear one - mode loses and recovers periodically energy is not clear .",
    "we try now to give an explanation of this mechanism in terms of floquet s theorem for parametric oscillators @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us consider the equation : @xmath198    where @xmath199 is a periodic function of time with period @xmath200 .",
    "the floquet s theorem means that the solution of ( [ eq : ma ] ) can be written in the form : @xmath201    where @xmath202 or @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the appropriate sign in front of @xmath206 is determined by the particular form of @xmath199 . with the minus sign one has @xmath207 .",
    "solution ( [ eq : sol ] ) means also that @xmath208    thus the values of @xmath209 , in successive cycles , increases by a factor @xmath1 when the time interval between the observations is equal to the period of @xmath199 .",
    "concerning the stability of the oscillator , we can consider three separate cases ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first case corresponds to real values for both @xmath210 and @xmath211 . since @xmath212 , one of them ( e.g. , @xmath210 ) is greater than unity .",
    "after @xmath213 cycles of oscillations , the magnitude of the displacement @xmath214 grows to the value @xmath215 which exceeds @xmath214 : the displacement therefore diverges exponentially with @xmath3 and the oscillations are unstable .",
    "the familiar case , known as `` parametric resonance '' , occurs when @xmath216 and the period of the floquet function @xmath217 is @xmath218 , where @xmath200 is the period of @xmath199 .",
    "the second case corresponds to @xmath219 .",
    "after @xmath220 cycles of oscillation the size of the displacement is equal to the initial value , i.e. , the oscillations are stable .    in the third case , @xmath221 , so that @xmath210 and @xmath211 have the same value and the case is `` degenerate '' . in this case",
    "one can show that the degenerate oscillator is stable or unstable with displacement growing linearly with @xmath3 .    in the matrix theory of the stability of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ma ] ) , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are roots of a quadratic equation .",
    "if we define the displacement and velocity at the beginning of the @xmath5-th cycle of the function @xmath199 as @xmath222 and @xmath223 , respectively , the corresponding variables at the beginning of the next cycle of @xmath199 are related to the vector @xmath224 by two linear equations which can be written as the matrix equation    @xmath225    thus the quadratic equation for @xmath1 is    @xmath226 \\mu + det[m(t ) ] = 0 ,   \\label{eq : tr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath227 $ ]  and   @xmath228 $ ] are the trace and determinant of the @xmath229 matrix  @xmath230  and   @xmath228 = \\mu_{1 } \\mu_{2 } = 1 $ ] .",
    "the matrix method is particularly useful in determining the stability of the solutions .",
    "suppose that the graph of @xmath199 vs @xmath231 is approximated by a series of steps of width @xmath133 and that the ordinate of the @xmath39-th step is @xmath232 .",
    "with reference to our case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam ] ) , let us suppose @xmath233 .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath234 $ ] , relating the displacement @xmath235 and velocity @xmath236 at the end of the interval @xmath237 to the respective values @xmath238 , @xmath239 at the beginning , is obtained by solving the equation of motion , subject to the initial conditions @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "since @xmath242 is constant over the interval @xmath237 , the equation of motion is that of a simple harmonic oscillator so that the following result is easily obtained : @xmath243    the complete transformation matrix @xmath244 $ ] , relating the initial and final column vectors , is obtained by taking the product of all the matrices for the entire time interval , i.e. :    @xmath245    the question of stability is readily resolved by determining the eigenparameters of @xmath230 , that is to say , by solving a quadratic equation .",
    "the pulsed behaviour of the energy of the nonlinear one - mode solution and the consequent pulsed behaviour of the linear modes can then be attributed to the time behaviour of the parameters @xmath246 , when @xmath197 .",
    "let us consider the figs .",
    "[ fig : en15pi ] and [ fig : q15pi ] which show , for @xmath139 and @xmath145 , respectively the first energy pulse of the mode @xmath154 and the corrispondent time variation of @xmath247 .    from numerical data",
    "we have verified that , in our case , namely in the case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam ] ) , we have @xmath248 and so @xmath207 , where @xmath200 is the period of the jacobian function @xmath249 . for @xmath145 , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omen ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa ] ) , we have @xmath250 and @xmath251 . since @xmath252 , the period of @xmath253 is @xmath254 and so @xmath255 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : per ] ) , comparing the values of @xmath247 each interval of @xmath255 , we can obtain the value of the parameter @xmath246 which determines the stability or instability of the solution .",
    "the pulsed behaviour of the solution and of the energy can then be attributed to a time variation of @xmath246 , due to the fact that , during the exchange of energy between the nonlinear one - mode and the other linear modes , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam ] ) is no longer exactly valid .",
    "if we suppose that the one - mode solution @xmath150 continues to oscillate with its normal frequency , but modulated in amplitude , during the energy exchange ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fi : q5 ] ) , then the parameter @xmath246 varies during this exchange , causing the typical pulsed behaviour for @xmath197 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath0 is very large , many linear modes are involved , the exchange of energy is much greater and irreversible and the oms does not recovers all its initial energy : the whole system tends asintotically to a state of energy equipartition .",
    "in figure [ fig : mur ] the time behaviour of the parameter @xmath1 is shown for the solution @xmath247 , when the one - mode excited is the one - mode @xmath128 , for @xmath138 and @xmath145 . with reference to fig .",
    "[ fig : q15pi ] , the values of @xmath1 are obtained calculating the ratio between two consecutive maxima of @xmath247 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : q15pi ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mur ] the link between the exponential growth and the subsequent exponential decreasing of @xmath247 with the variation of the parameter @xmath1 from values greater than one to smaller values .",
    "in this paper we have studied the problem of stability of the oms s in the fermi - pasta - ulam @xmath0 oscillator chain . although this problem has been tackled many times in the last years , analytical results were available only for the case @xmath56 , where @xmath3 is the number of particles in the chain .",
    "we have envisaged a simple numerical method , which tests the stability of solutions against the numerical errors introduced automatically by the numerical algorithm of integration of motion equations .",
    "the method reproduces the analytical results already known for case @xmath56 , and allows to obtain the threshold energy density above which the oms is unstable , in the other cases , namely the cases @xmath173 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath256 .",
    "we have found that , for each case , there is a characteristic energy density , above which , there is a large range of values of energy densities , before the chaotic region , in which the oms presents an intermittent behaviour , in the sense that the nonlinear mode keeps its initial excitation energy for long times and periodically , abruptly , loses and recovers a fraction of this energy .",
    "we have verified that , for the case @xmath56 , this characteristic energy density coincides , for large @xmath3 , with the threshold energy density given by ( [ eq : eps ] ) .",
