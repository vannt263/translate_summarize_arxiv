    "so , investigating and quantifying the amount of entanglement contained in entangled system interacting with open systems is very important in the context of quantum information @xcite . as an example",
    ", yu and eberly @xcite , has investigated the dynamics of entanglement for entangled qubit pairs undergoing various modes of decoherence .",
    "they showed that the dynamics of entanglement between a two qubit system interacting independently with classical or quantum noise , displays two different types of behavior ; the phenomena of entanglement decay and entanglement sudden death , esd @xcite .",
    "since then , different systems have been investigated .",
    "for some systems , the esd appears whenever the system is open or closed @xcite .",
    "the effect of the local squeezed reservoir on initially entangled two qubit system is investigated , where it is shown that the squeezing causes different behavior of entanglement decay on different time scales @xcite . recently in @xcite , it has been shown that the esd always exists with thermal and squeezed reservoirs , where the authors presented explicit expression for the esd for some entangled states .",
    "also , it has been recently shown @xcite , that the esd and entanglement decay phenomena appear for qubit system passed through bloch channel @xcite .",
    "the esd under the effect of the individual environments has been experimentally seen @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to continue investigating questions of this sort : by how much are the entanglement and the information of entangled two qubits state degrade when it passes through a thermal or squeezed reservoir .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , we present the model and its solution .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement is investigated in sec.3 , where we consider two classes of entangled states as an initial states , maximum and partial entangled states .",
    "sec.4 is devoted to study the dynamics of quantum information , where we quantify the amount of disturbance and exchange information between the entangled state and the local reservoirs .",

    "there is non desirable interactions between the qubits and the reservoir .",

    "the behavior of the entanglement when the qubits interact with squeezed reservoir is depicted in fig.(2a ) . in this case",
    "the entanglement decays smoothly and for small values of the squeezed parameter , @xmath47 , one observes the long lived entanglement .",
    "also , the vanishing time of entanglement is much larger than that has been shown in fig.(2a ) .",
    "quantum information science has emerged as one of the most exciting scientific developments in the past decade .",
    "let us assume that alice and bob have coded information , say a quantum secret key , in their shared entangled state .",
    "but due to the reality there is no isolated systems , the entangled state which carries the information interacts with its surroundings .",
    "these undesirable interactions cause a loss of information .",
    "therefore quantum information , in fact , can not be perfectly copied , neither locally @xcite nor at distance@xcite .",
    "our aim in this section is to investigate the dynamics of information which is carried by the shared entangled state . in our calculations",
    ", we consider the effect of the thermal and the squeezed reservoirs . in this",
    "treatments , we investigate two phenomena , the disturbance of information and the exchange information between the shared state and its local environments     ( a ) for the thermal reservoir with @xmath48 ( b ) for the squeezed reservoir with @xmath49,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( a ) for the thermal reservoir with @xmath48 ( b ) for the squeezed reservoir with @xmath49,title=\"fig : \" ] ( -210,80)@xmath50 ( -425,80)@xmath50    one says that a system is _ disturbed _ when its initial and final states do not coincide . since the information is coded on the input states , then it may be quantified in terms of fidelities @xcite . the closeness of the output quantum state @xmath51 to the input one @xmath52 is expressed by the quantum fidelity @xmath53 , where @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "now , we can define the disturbance , @xmath50 as @xmath55 fig(3a ) , shows , the behavior of the disturbance of information in the case of the thermal reservoir .",
    "it is clear that the disturbance increases as the scaled time , @xmath39 increases . for small values of the thermal photon",
    "the disturbance increases gradually at the expense of the fidelity of the teleported state . for scaled time @xmath56 ,",
    "the disturbance @xmath50 reaches its maximum value .",
    "this means that the input and the output states are completely different with the entangled state converted to separable state see(fig.(2a ) ) .",
    "as one increases the thermal photon number , the disturbance increases with time and reaches to a constant value as soon as the entanglement disappears .",
    "so , the entangled state is completely separable and there is no more information to be disturbed . for the values which causes a sudden - death of entanglement as depicted in fig.(1a ) , the disturbance sudden be constant .",
    "this means at this values there as a sudden death of information .",
    "fig.(3b ) , describes the behavior of the disturbance of information in the presence of the local reservoir . in general",
    ", the same behavior is seen as that depicted for the thermal reservoir , but the disturbance @xmath50 increases slowly and consequently the time loss of information is large .",
    "this behavior is due to the long - lived entanglement as seen in fig.(2b ) .",
    "so , for small values of the squeezed reservoir parameters , the time of disturbed information can be infinite .    to quantify the amount of information exchange between the state and the environment during the evaluation",
    ", we use the entropy exchange @xcite , @xmath57 if there is no interaction between the system and its surroundings , then the entropy exchange is zero and consequently there is no information loss from the system .",
    "one can look at the environment as an eavesdropper , who wants to gain more information from the entangled system , which carries this information . in fig.(4 ) , we investigate the dynamics of this phenomenon also for the thermal and squeezed environment . in both cases ,",
    "the exchange information increases as one increases the reservoir parameters , but as soon as the state turns into a separable state , the exchange information decreases .",
    "then there is no more interaction with the local environment , therefore the exchange information becomes a constant .",
    "( -210,80)@xmath58 ( -425,80)@xmath58    the effect of the thermal reservoir is seen in fig.(4a ) , where for small values of the mean photon number @xmath59 , the exchange entropy increases to reach its maximum values and then decreases with gradually time until it reaches to a constant value at @xmath60 .",
    "we notice that , at this time the state turns into a separable state ( see fig.(2a ) ) so there is no more exchange between the environment and the state . as one increases the mean photon number , the exchange information becomes constant at @xmath61 . for larger value of the mean photon number ,",
    "say @xmath62 , the exchange information becomes constant at much earlier time .",
    "the behavior of the exchange information in the presence of the local squeezed reservoir is the same as that shown for the thermal reservoir .",
    "but the time in which the exchange information becomes constant is much larger than that depicted for the thermal case .",
    "science in the squeezed reservoir case the entanglement is long - lived .",
    "in this contribution , we use the kraus operators to investigate the dynamics of entangled state passes through a thermal or squeezed reservoir .",
    "the phenomenon of the entanglement decay and the sudden death of entanglement are shown for both reservoirs .",
    "we show that the entanglement lived longer for the squeezed reservoir .",
    "also , the disturbance of information is discussed for both environment , where it is very sensitive to the thermal reservoir parameter much more than the squeezed vacuum reservoir parameters . for large values of the thermal photon reservoir",
    ", the information is suddenly disturbed , but it is disturbed gradually for the squeezed reservoir .",
    "the loss of information is quantified by the means of the entropy exchange between the environment and the shared entangled state . for both environments , the exchange information increases and leads to a constant when the system turns into separable state . for thermal reservoir ,",
    "the exchange information becomes constant faster than that for the squeezed reservoir .",
