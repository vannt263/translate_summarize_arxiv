    "starting with the pioneering works of kane and mele @xcite and others @xcite , there has been a surge of interest in topological characterization of insulating states @xcite .",
    "it is now understood that there exist distinct symmetry - protected classes of non - interacting insulators , such that two representatives from different classes can not be adiabatically transformed into one another ( without closing the insulating gap and breaking the underlying symmetry along the way ) .",
    "a complete topological classification of such band insulators has been developed in the form of a `` periodic table of topological insulators '' @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was realized that the non - trivial ( topological ) insulators from this table possess , as their hallmark features , gapless boundary modes .",
    "the latter have been spectacularly observed in a variety of experiments in both three @xcite and two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned classification however is limited to non - interacting systems and as such it represents a classification of single - particle band structures .",
    "adding interactions to the theory leads to significant complications .",

    "a basic model of these heavy fermion systems involves even - parity conduction electrons hybridizing with strongly correlated @xmath8-electrons . at low temperatures ,",
    "a hybridization gap opens up and an insulating state can be formed .",
    "its simplified mean - field description makes it amenable to a topological classification according to the non - interacting theory , and a topologically - non - trivial state appears due to the opposite parities of the states being hybridized .",
    "although the mean - field description ( formally well - controlled in the large-@xmath9 approximation @xcite ) does appear to correctly describe the nature of the topological kondo insulating states observed in bulk materials so far @xcite , it is interesting to see if non - perturbative effects beyond mean - field can qualitatively change the mean - field picture .",
    "in contrast to higher dimensions , where reliable theoretical techniques to treat strong interactions are scarce , there exists a rich arsenal of such non - perturbative methods for one - dimensional systems , where strongly - correlated `` non - mean - field '' ground states abound .",
    "since the kondo insulating hamiltonian and its mean - field treatment are largely dimension - independent , it is interesting to consider the one - dimensional such model as a natural playground to study interplay between strong interactions and non - trivial topology .    with this motivation in mind",
    ", we study here a strongly - interacting model of a one - dimensional topological kondo insulator , i.e. , a `` @xmath0-wave '' kondo - heisenberg model , introduced earlier by alexandrov and coleman @xcite , who treated the problem in the mean - field approximation . here , we go beyond the mean - field level and consider quantum fluctuations non - peturbatively using the abelian bosonization technique .",
    "it is shown that a `` topological coupling '' between the electrons in the hubbard chain and spins in the heisenberg chain , gives rise to a charge gap at half - filling in the former .",
    "the relevant interaction between the remaining spin-@xmath3 degrees of freedom in the chains is effectively ferromagnetic , which locks them into a state qualitatively similar to the haldane s spin-@xmath2 chain .",
    "the ground state therefore is a strongly - correlated topological insulator , which exhibits neutral spin-@xmath3 end modes .",
    "while our main motivation is essentially theoretical ( i.e. , to allow a deeper understanding of strongly interacting topological matter ) , we believe our results might have direct application in ultracold atom experiments , where double - well optical superlattices loaded with atoms in @xmath10 and @xmath0 orbitals have been realized @xcite .",
    "in addition , our work might have some relevance in recent experimental results @xcite , which suggest the existence of a ferromagnetic phase transition and/or suppressed surface charge transport in samples of samarium hexaboride ( @xmath11  a three - dimensional topological kondo insulator ) .",
