    "the cyclotron motion of charge carriers with a well defined effective mass @xmath1 and the related resonant absorption of light at the cyclotron frequency @xmath2 are basic physical phenomena representative of the magneto - optical response of conventional condensed - matter systems . well - established and often applied , cyclotron resonance ( cr ) became through the years a common technique routinely used in solid - state physics , inherently connected with the effective mass of elementary electronic excitations.@xcite    recently fabricated graphene@xcite immediately became a challenge for cr measurements and implied necessity to comprehend the phenomenon of cyclotron resonance in a system with massless charge carriers.@xcite special character of cr in graphene can be exemplified on the basis of a simple quasi - classical approach.@xcite if we solve the classical equation of motion for a charged particle with an energy @xmath3 which depends linearly on the momentum @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 , we find out that the precession - like ( cyclotron ) motion remains characteristic also for these dirac - like particles , nevertheless , with a cyclotron frequency modified to @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the classical cyclotron motion and consequently also the cyclotron resonance of massless dirac fermions scale linearly with the applied magnetic field @xmath7 , similar to conventional massive particles , but they depend on the particle energy , which appears in a form of an energy - dependent cyclotron mass defined by the einstein relation @xmath8 .",
    "surprisingly , this classical , i.e. linear with the magnetic field , cyclotron resonance has not been clearly observed in graphene so far .",
    "instead , the optical response of graphene has been experimentally explored@xcite only in the quantum regime , when all detected transitions correspond to excitations between well - separated landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "these measurements provided us with a unique insight into the ll spectrum of graphene and directly visualized its intriguing @xmath9-scaling , but no information about the quasi - classical limit could be extracted .",
    "consequently , it remains a challenge to demonstrate experimentally the quasi - classical cyclotron resonance in graphene , or interestingly , to study the crossover between this classical ( linear in @xmath7 ) and fully quantum - mechanical ( linear in @xmath9 ) magneto - optical response of graphene  the crossover , which is not present in a system of massive particles , where the response always remains linear in the applied magnetic field .",
    "here we report on magneto - optical measurements on highly - doped epitaxial graphene grown on the silicon - terminated surface of sic .",
    "we identify the cyclotron - resonance - like response related to the massless dirac fermions in the vicinity of the fermi level , which evolves nearly linearly with the applied magnetic field , as expected from ( quasi-)classical considerations .",
    "these results are compared to the currently well - understood response of multilayer epitaxial graphene prepared on the carbon - terminated surface of sic , where majority of ( rotationally stacked ) graphene sheets is nearly undoped and where the fully quantum - mechanical treatment is appropriate for its description .",
    "in our study , we present data taken on two particular samples of graphene prepared by thermal decomposition on the surface of semi - insulating silicon carbide.@xcite both specimen have been grown at 1600@xmath10c in ar atmosphere using a commercially available horizontal chemical vapor deposition hot - wall reactor ( epigress v508 ) , inductively heated by a rf generator .",
    "the sample denoted as a in our study , grown on the c - terminated surface of silicon carbide ( 4h - sic[0001 ] ) , represents a standard multilayer epitaxial graphene ( meg ) specimen .",
    "the majority of sheets in this structure is practically undoped ( residual @xmath4-like doping expected at the level of @xmath11  @xmath12 , see refs .   and ) with the electronic band structure similar if not identical to an isolated graphene monolayer , provided by the characteristic rotational stacking of layers.@xcite this fact is reflected in the micro - raman spectra taken on this sample , which revealed dominantly single - component ( lorentzian - like ) 2d band ,  @xcite nevertheless , some bernal - stacked residuals have been observed on selected locations as well .",
    "the sample b has been prepared on the si - terminated surface of sic ( 4h - sic[0001 ] ) and also characterized in the micro - raman experiment . similarly to the previous sample , the dominantly observed single - component 2d band serves as an indication for linearity of electronic bands .",
    "it points towards the presence of a single graphene sheet ( in addition to the non - graphene - like buffer layer@xcite ) , as in contrast to meg on the c - face , the few - layer graphene stacks on the si - face exhibit bernal and not rotational ordering.@xcite in addition , such monolayers are typically rather highly doped by the charge transfer from the substrate.@xcite    to measure the ( non - polarized ) infrared transmittance of our samples , we used the radiation of a globar , which was analyzed by a fourier transform spectrometer and delivered to the sample via light - pipe optics .",
    "the light was then detected by a composite bolometer kept at @xmath13  k placed directly below the sample .",
    "measurements were done in the faraday configuration in a superconducting solenoid .",
    "both investigated samples were fully opaque in the energy range 85 - 220  mev due to phonon - related absorption in sic .",
    "let us start our discussion with the data obtained on the sample a , i.e. on the meg structure grown on the c - terminated surface of sic , see fig .",
    "[ spkt - c - face ] , whose magneto - optical response is relatively well understood.@xcite transmission spectra are in this kind of specimens dominated by relatively sharp absorption lines with a typical @xmath9-like scaling ( see fig .  [ fanchart - c - face ] ) and taking the ll spectrum of graphene : @xmath14 , we easily identify them as inter - ll transitions l@xmath15@xmath16l@xmath17 and l@xmath18@xmath16l@xmath19 with @xmath20 . the corresponding fermi velocity can be evaluated as @xmath21  m.s@xmath22 . as a matter of fact , this response is equivalent to that of an exfoliated graphene monolayer@xcite and in turn it serves as a direct indication that layers in meg indeed behave as independent , electrically isolated , graphene sheets .",
    "apparently , here we deal with graphene in its fully quantum regime , i.e. we study optical excitations between well - separated landau levels , whose @xmath9-scaling and multi - mode character are directly related to the linearity of the electronic bands.@xcite to characterize our sample further , we can set the upper limit for the carrier density that can not significantly exceed @xmath23  @xmath12 , as the transition l@xmath24l@xmath25 is observed down to the magnetic field of 100  mt ( the filling factor @xmath26 ) .",
    "we assume that the graphene sheets are slightly @xmath27doped as follows from the recent arpes study done on equivalent specimens .",
    "@xcite we should also note that the dominant graphene - like lines are often accompanied by additional spectral features , which are usually significantly weaker , nevertheless still well - defined in the spectra , located especially at low energies , see e.g. the transition denoted by stars in fig .",
    "[ spkt - c - face ] .",
    "we will come back to these features later on after we discuss the response of the sample b.    the sample b exhibits a very much different behavior in our magneto - transmission experiment and shows no @xmath9-scaled spectral features , which are , as we have learned above , characteristic of graphene in its quantum regime .",
    "instead , it clearly shows magnetic - field - induced transmission at low energies accompanied by a relatively wide absorption minimum , which moves towards higher energies with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "we found this behavior to be characteristic for all graphene specimens prepared on si - terminated surface of sic ( not shown in this paper ) , nevertheless , the total intensity of the observed spectral features as well as the position of the absorption minimum slightly varied from sample to sample .    to explain this behavior , we should recall that epitaxial graphene on the si - terminated surface is usually highly doped by the charge transfer from the substrate , reaching carrier densities up to @xmath28  @xmath12 ( @xmath29  ev ) , see e.g. ref .  , with quality ( expressed in terms of scattering time or mobility ) comparable to meg on the c - face of sic.@xcite therefore , at magnetic fields of a few tesla , lls should not be resolved around the fermi level and the system should remain in the quasi - classical regime .",
    "interestingly , owing to the non - equidistant spacing of lls in graphene , the tuning from a fully quantum regime to the classical one is possible just by changing the fermi level .",
    "if we adopt this , the qualitative explanation of the observed behavior becomes straightforward .",
    "the relative magneto - transmission spectrum @xmath30 reflects two specific effects : the low - energy free carrier ( drude - like ) absorption , which is gradually suppressed with the increasing field , and the cyclotron resonance itself .",
    "the former one gives rise to the field - induced transmission at low energies that decreases monotonically with the photon energy , and the latter one is manifested by an absorption minimum close to the energy of the cyclotron resonance @xmath31 .",
    "let us now proceed with the quantitative analysis of this data , which will allow us to determine the characteristic field - dependence of @xmath31 .    in the framework of the classical theory for cyclotron resonance , the optical conductivity",
    "is given by @xmath32 which describes both the cr active ( @xmath33 ) and inactive ( @xmath34 ) polarization modes of light , as well as the drude - like low - energy absorption ( at @xmath35 ) .",
    "@xmath36 here denotes zero - field dc conductivity and @xmath37 is a phenomenologically introduced damping .",
    "we should also point out that in graphene , contrary to conventional systems of massive particles , the cyclotron frequency @xmath31 is not independent of @xmath36 and @xmath37 as the `` effective '' effective mass of dirac fermions ( at the fermi level ) can be determined from these two parameters .",
    "the transmission of circularly - polarized light through the studied specimen ( graphene sheet on an isolating substrate ) can be expressed by formula:@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 which is derived for a dielectric slab with the index of refraction @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) with an infinitely thin conducting layer on one of its surfaces ( described by @xmath42 ) . @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for the real speed of light and the vacuum permittivity , respectively .",
    "the dependence of @xmath45 on the thickness of the slab ( i.e. interference effects ) has been already averaged out .    within the framework of our simple model",
    ", we can easily calculate the relative change of the sample transmission with the magnetic field @xmath46/2t(0)$ ] , and compare it with our experimental data . as the conductivity as well as the damping parameter can in principle vary with @xmath7 , we have first found their appropriate values at zero field , @xmath47  @xmath48 and @xmath49  mev , which we afterwards kept constant and varied only @xmath50 and @xmath51 to reproduce our experimental traces .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ spkt - si - face ] and [ fanchart - si - face ] , our simple theoretical model is able to reproduce experimental transmission spectra very well and the cr frequency indeed follows a clear linear in @xmath7 dependence .",
    "the conductivity @xmath52 and the cr half - width @xmath51 exhibited in our fitting procedure a weak decrease and increase , respectively , but practically remain within the interval of uncertainty estimated for @xmath36 and @xmath53 and they can be therefore taken as nearly constant in the investigated range of fields . the width ( fwhm ) of the cyclotron resonance absorption peak @xmath54 has been found comparable with the cyclotron energy @xmath31 what justifies the quasi - classical regime in the investigated sample .",
    "we should also clarify that a relatively broad cr resonance implies that the minimum in the transmission spectra does not exactly match to the position of the cr mode .",
    "this is explained in the inset of fig .",
    "[ spkt - si - face ] , where the transmission curves @xmath55 at @xmath56  t and @xmath57 are depicted as calculated from parameters obtained in our data analysis .",
    "we also plot curves @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which show expected transmission in opposite circular polarizations of light , i.e. in the cr active and inactive modes , respectively .",
    "let us note that all these transmission curves share a common baseline at @xmath60 , which corresponds to the light transmission through a dielectric slab without any conducting sheet ( or away from resonances )",
    ". this value can be easily obtained from eq .   for @xmath61 .",
    "let us now return to the main finding of our analysis , i.e. to the clear linear in @xmath7 dependence of the cyclotron resonance as shown in fig .",
    "[ fanchart - si - face ] .",
    "if we evaluate the effective mass corresponding to this cr mode , we obtain @xmath62 , which according to the einstein relation @xmath63 implies the fermi level of @xmath64  mev in a reasonably good agreement with conclusions of arpes measurements on similar samples.@xcite in this estimation , we used the fermi velocity of @xmath65  m.s@xmath22 determined from the measurement on the sample a , but very similar velocities are reported by arpes for graphene on the si - terminated surface of sic as well .",
    "@xcite    the observation of the cr mode that is linear in the applied field @xmath7 justifies our simple approach in which ( otherwise massless ) dirac fermions are considered as massive particles , the mass of which is determined by the fermi energy . on the other hand",
    ", this confirmation implies another constrain on parameters used in our fitting .",
    "namely , the conductivity @xmath36 can be directly estimated within the boltzmann transport theory from the scattering rate @xmath66 and from the fermi energy : @xmath67 .",
    "this relation was respected in our fitting procedure and required an additional self - consistent loop to keep the correct relation between @xmath36 and @xmath53 on the basis of @xmath68 extracted from the fitting .",
    "obviously , this approach works only in case of specimens with a full coverage by the graphene monolayer , otherwise the conductivity derived from @xmath53 and @xmath68 exceeds the value obtained directly from the fitting .",
    "the ratio of these two values thus could serve as a simple parameter that describes fraction of coverage by graphene .",
    "we should note that the evaluated mass of @xmath69 is surprisingly close the effective mass of @xmath70 point electrons in bulk graphite @xmath710.058@xmath72,@xcite but this similarity represents just a coincidence . to prove this , we can for instance argue that bulk graphite reaches the quantum limit at fields around 7  t,@xcite and therefore it can not exhibit cr line that corresponds to the effective mass of @xmath70 point electrons .",
    "instead , due to the formal similarity of the band structure at the @xmath70 point with the graphene bilayer , it should provide the cr - like absorption at energy by a factor of @xmath73 higher , as indeed observed experimentally.@xcite    to summarize , the highly - doped graphene sheet on the si - terminated surface allows us to study the cr resonance of masssless dirac fermions in its fully classical limit , when it becomes strictly linear with the applied magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , let us look at the same problem using the quantum - mechanical description , i.e. interpret our data as intra - band excitations between adjacent ( but in reality significantly broadened ) landau levels , as schematically shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fanchart - si - face ] . to clarify the linear in @xmath7 response , found in a system with a @xmath9-scaled ll spectrum , we only need to consider the fermi level @xmath68 located high in the conduction ( or equivalently low in the valence ) band and independent of the magnetic field .",
    "this can be exactly ensured by the pinning the fermi level by the surface states in the substrate or fulfilled approximatively , when lls significantly overlap . at a given magnetic field , the @xmath40-th",
    "ll approaches the fermi level , @xmath74 , and the active cr - like transition ( between adjacent lls ) has the energy of @xmath75 , i.e. it indeed becomes linear in @xmath7 and moves with the slope related to the cyclotron mass @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of data obtained on highly - doped graphene in the sample b allows us to come back to the low - energy features in spectra taken on the sample a. also in this kind of samples , we usually find relatively weak spectral features whose energy moves nearly linearly in @xmath7 .",
    "even though the sample a dominantly consists of nearly undoped graphene sheets , the increase of the magneto - transmission at lower energies serves as an indication of some free carriers in the sample , similarly to the sample b. in fact , also in meg on the c - face of sic , first few layers nearby the interface are usually doped by charge transfer from the substrate .",
    "the transition denoted by stars ( see figs .",
    "[ spkt - c - face ] and [ fanchart - c - face ] ) thus could be assigned to the cr response of these doped layers , and its characteristic slope @xmath764.5",
    "mev.t@xmath22 ( effective mass of @xmath77 ) would imply the fermi level of @xmath78  mev . on the other hand",
    ", the carrier density in these doped layers gradually decreases with the distance from the substrate , which should prevent observation of a well - defined cr mode ( whose energy depends on the density of massless particles ) , while the transition denoted by the star remains relatively narrow in our data .",
    "more likely , this line originates in bernal - stacked residuals , especially in the graphene bilayer which has been identified as a minor but not negligible component of meg.@xcite the masssive dirac fermions in the bilayer are characterized by an effective mass of @xmath79 ( @xmath80  mev@xcite ) which does not match to the effective mass derived for the `` star '' transition , but the characteristic ll spectrum in the bilayer , @xmath81,@xcite implies in the quantum limit appearance of the cr mode ( l@xmath82l@xmath83 transitions ) whose slope is by a factor of @xmath73 higher .",
    "the transition denoted by the star , with a slope corresponding to the effective mass of @xmath77 , thus could be assigned an undoped graphene bilayer in which the cr absorption should correspond to the mass of @xmath84 .",
    "nevertheless , the definitive conclusion can not be drawn on the basic of our current data .",
    "we have explored magneto - optical response of graphene in two distinctively different regimes .",
    "whereas the weakly doped sheets in multilayer epitaxial graphene on the c - terminated surface allowed us to study the optical response of graphene in the quantum limit , massless dirac fermions in the quasi - classical regime can be explored in highly doped epitaxial graphene prepared on the si - terminated surface of sic .",
    "the response of the former system clearly shows @xmath9-like scaling , typical of landau levels in systems with linear electronic bands , the latter case proves that cyclotron resonance of massless particles remains in the quasi - classical limit linear with the magnetic field .    _ additional note : _ during our work on the manuscript we became aware of faraday rotation measurements on epitaxial graphene,@xcite in which a similar conclusion about cyclotron resonance of massless dirac fermions in the quasi - classical limit has been made .",
