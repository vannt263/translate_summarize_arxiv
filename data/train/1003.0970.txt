    "rest - frame uv spectra of roughly 20% of all quasars exhibit blueshifted broad absorption lines ( bal ) that are indicative of an outflow .",
    "bal are mainly associated with resonance lines of high ionization species , like , , ( hibal ) , and can reach velocities as high as 50,000 km @xmath0 @xcite . despite various recent statistical studies of bal quasars @xcite the relationship between hibal and the host galaxy remain illusive as these outflows do not contain distance diagnostics in their spectra .",
    "thus , it is difficult to establish whether the outflows affect only the near agn environment ( 0.1 - 10  pc ) or whether they extend to the scales of the entire galaxy ( 1 - 10  kpc ) .",
    "a subset of balqsos also show absorption features from low ionization species such as , , and most importantly for diagnostics , and .",
    "these absorption features are generally complex , as they are made of multiple components of narrower ( of the order of a few hundred km  s@xmath1 ) absorption troughs .",
    "agn with this kind of features are often refer to as felobal . in these systems",
    "the spectra of and is valuable because they often include absorption troughs from metastable levels , which serve to determine the distance of the outflow from the central source and thereby beginning to relate the outflows to their host galaxy .",
    "such outflows were studied in the past @xcite .",
    "however , the presently available sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the development of advanced bal analysis tools ( arav et al 2002 , gabel 2005 , arav et al 2005 ) allow for a more accurate and systematic study of these systems . with this in mind , we began a comprehensive study of felobal outflows that contain distance diagnostics @xcite .",
    "up to the present , though , all studies are based on either global properties of the multi - component absorption troughs or the strongest kinematic component .",
    "little is known about the individual physical properties of the components and their relationship to the whole outflow . in the best studied cases , @xcite were able to obtain some column densities for individual components , but could neither diagnose the physical conditions of the components nor derive their relative distances .",
    "simple assumptions that all components had similar physical conditions and that they have either constant speed or equal monotonic acceleration would lead to the conclusion that either the absorbers are scattered along a wide range of distances from the central source or the absorbers vary in age as a result of episodic ejections .",
    "but bal systems in general are far from simple . apart from a weak correlations between the absorber bulk velocities and bolometric luminosity of the agn @xcite",
    ", no correlations have been found among velocity , width , ionization , or any other observable properties .",
    "recent high spectral resolution eschell observations of two quasars qso 23591241 and sdss j03180600 with the very large telescope ( vlt ) have allowed us to study in detail the various independent components that compose their felobal .",

    "both quasars exhibit a rich multi - component felobal comprising five and eleven components respectively .",
    "the strongest components in the felobal , which are also the first absorbers from the central engine ( see section 3 ) , for each of these objects were measured and analyzed in @xcite and @xcite for qso 23591241 and @xcite for sdss j03180600 .",

    "thus , the ionization structure of a warm photoionized plasma are typically characterized by the so called ionization parameter , which is defined as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the speed of light , @xmath115 is the gas density , @xmath116 is the ionizing photon flux , @xmath117 is the rate of hydrogen ionizing photons emitted by the ionizing source , and @xmath118 is the distance from the ionizing source to the cloud . from this definition",

    "fortunately , the combined measurements of column densities for and in all of the components of qso  23591241 and and in the components of sdss  j03180600 allow us to constrain the ionization parameter of all of these components .",
    "we use the photoionization modeling code cloudy  c07.02.01 @xcite to compute grids of models in @xmath119 for each value of @xmath120 of interest .",
    "all models are calculated for @xmath121 ( total hydrogen column density ) running from the inner phase of the cloud to deep into the ionization fronts ( if s ) where the temperature drops to only a few thousand k. for qso  23591241 we assumed solar abundances as in @xcite .",
    "then , the accumulated column densities of the metastable 2  @xmath122 excited state of ( hereafter , @xmath123 ) and total were extracted out of the cloudy output files and plotted in fig .  [ columnqso2359 ] as n(*)/n ( ) vs. @xmath124n ( * ) .",
    "these plots serve as direct diagnostics of @xmath119 by marking the measured column densities on the plots .",
    "further , the value of @xmath121 is also readily available as there is a direct correspondence in each model between the accumulated total hydrogen column and the accumulated column density of all species .",
    "the diagnostic power of the combined @xmath123 and lines was explained in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath123 column density is set by the column , which is bound to the fraction and the ionization parameter .",
    "this is because whenever helium is ionized hydrogen , with a much lower ionization potential , must be ionized too . for any conceivable quasar ionizing continuum recombination of he",
    "ii to neutral he occurs simultaneously with recombination of h ii to neutral h. this is shown in fig . 1 of korista et al .",

    "the ionization fraction of across the ionization threshold is determined by charge exchange with hydrogen @xmath125 thus , the column density of traces the column of neutral hydrogen and @xmath126 in other words , the measured ratio of column densities of @xmath123 to serves as direct indicator of the average ionization parameter of the gas cloud . within the cloud , whose depth , @xmath127 , is expected to be much smaller than @xmath118 , the @xmath119 varies as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the optical depth to hydrogen ionizing photons , which is proportional to the column density of neutral hydrogen .",
    "hence , at the inner phase of the cloud and for a large fraction of it hydrogen is nearly fully ionized and @xmath129 remains small . within this depth in the cloud",
    "the ionization of the gas and hence the @xmath130(@xmath123)/@xmath130 ( ) ratio is expected to remain roughly constant ( see figure 8 in arav et al .",
    "deeper in the cloud , a small decrease in the ionization of hydrogen leads to an increase in @xmath129 , which in turns reduces the number of ionizing photons right ahead and results in even lower hydrogen ionization . at this point ,",
    "an ionization front develops and is accompanied by a quick drop of the @xmath130(@xmath123)/@xmath130 ( ) ratio into the cloud or , equivalently , @xmath130(@xmath123 ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath130(@xmath123)/@xmath130 ( ) vs. @xmath130(@xmath123 ) plots shown in fig .  3 offer a complete diagnostic for @xmath119 and the total hydrogen column density ( @xmath121 ) for clouds of a given chemical composition .    here , it is important to realize that as these plots are sensitive to the integrated flux of hydrogen ionizing photons , most of which ( @xmath131 ) arise from the spectral region between 1 and 4  ry in quasar sed .",
    "thus , the plots depend only little on the actual shape of the sed .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  3 by showing the theoretical curves as calculated with the mathews and ferland ( 1987 ;",
    "mf87 hereafter ) quasar sed and with the transmitted spectrum from the inner most component ( * e * ) of the outflow .",
    "that component * e * is the first absorber from the source in qso  23591241 becomes apparent as this has the largest @xmath119  dex and is also the densest , thus it is concluded from eqn .",
    "1 that it most have the smallest distance @xmath118 among all components ( see also the discussion below ) .    from the diagnostics in fig .  4",
    "it results that component * e * has @xmath132= -2.4 for @xmath133@xmath134 .",
    "component * d * with a density @xmath133@xmath135 has @xmath136 , and the two lowest density components * b * and * c * have @xmath137 and -2.9 respectively . *",
    "notice that the electron densities of components * b * and * d * are sufficiently similar to each other , and in fact overlap within the uncertainty bars , for them to be plotted on the same diagnostic diagram without any significant lose of accuracy .",
    "*    we build similar plots for sdss j03180600 but based on the column densities of and ( fig  [ columnj0318 ] ) . for these models",
    "we start with a chemical composition expected for a galaxy with metalicity @xmath138=4.2 , which we found to be a reasonably choice that fits well the measured column densities ( dunn et al .",
    "models with either solar composition or very high metalicities ( e.g @xmath1397.2 ) can be discarded on the basis of the observed absorption troughs for various species .",
    "basing the diagnostics on two ions of the same element has two important advantages over the previous plots : ( 1 ) the column density ratio is mostly independent of the assumed chemical abundances , and ( 2 ) the plots are mostly independent of @xmath120 . a disadvantage , though , is that the is mostly created through photoionization by radiation below the hydrogen ionization threshold ( 0.6  ry ) , while has a formation energy higher than that of .",
    "consequently , the @xmath130()/@xmath130 ( ) is more sensitive to the sed than in the previous case . because sdss j03180600 is a extremely reddened object and the location of the extinguishing dust with respect to the absorber is unknown we need to consider two different seds for the models .",
    "these are : the uv - soft sed developed in dunn et al ( 2009 ) and this sed after reddening . in fig",
    ".  4 we plot @xmath140()/@xmath130 ( ) ) vs. @xmath141 ( ) as obtained from the two seds considered ( upper panels ) and in the cases in which these seds are attenuated by component * i * , which is identified as the inner most absorber ( lower panels ) .    from these diagnostics",
    "the densest component * i * has the highest @xmath119 ( = @xmath142 dex for the unreddened sed and @xmath143  dex for the reddened sed ) and largest total column ( = @xmath144  dex for the unreddened sed and @xmath145  dex for the reddened sed ) . the lower density components * a * and * k * have considerably less column density and are less ionized .    from the physical conditions derived above it is now possible to estimate the distance from each absorption component to the ionizing source .",
    "but , it is convenient to determine first the relative distances of all component to the source .",
    "the relative distance can be obtained more accurately from observations than absolute distance .",
    "this is because the absolute determination of distance depends strongly on the number of ionizing photons of the sed and on whether this is reddened before ionizing the cloud .",
    "so , we see that in qso 23591241 and sdss j03180600 the absolute distance to the absorbers vary by several factors depending on whether reddening of the sed occurs before or after ionizing the absorbers .",
    "this sort of uncertainty , however , does not affect the relative distances among absorbers . from eqn.(1 )",
    "one gets @xmath146,\\ ] ] where @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 are the distance , rate of ionizing photons , particle density , and ionization parameter for a given reference component , which we choose as the strongest component in each of the absorbers studied ( i.e. * e * in qso 2359 - 1241 and * i * in sdss j03180600 ) . in identifying the inner - most absorber",
    "it is important to realize that in the first approximation that uses the same sed in determining the distance to all components the result is actually correct for the inner - most component and overestimated for the rest ( see eqn .",
    "4 of the manuscript ) .",
    "this means that the absorber with the shortest distance to the source in this first approximation is indeed the inner - most absorber . for any other absorber to located in the inner - most position the other absorbers with shorter distance in the first order approximation would have to be at larger distances that initially estimated , which is impossible if the flux of ionizing photons is to be reduced by the effect of attenuation .",
    "notice that the relative locations of all the components could , in principle , be determined following the same logical argument , except that they are so close together that their estimated distance differences soon become smaller than the uncertainties .",
    "the strongest components are also the innermost , as we will see below . for any absorption component that sees the same unattenuated radiation from the source as the reference component @xmath151 . on the other hand , if a component is shadowed by intervening gas , particularly by the reference component , @xmath152 .",
    "table  [ distances ] presents the relative distance for components in the two absorbers considered .",
    "first , we assume that all components see the same unattenuated source ( @xmath151 ) and the results are given in columns 4 and 5 of the table . under this assumption components * e * and * i * are the inner - most absorbers in qso 23591241 and sdss j03180600 respectively . beyond these",

    "this indicates that the minor components may not be considered as ejection events in their own merits , but instead they are physically related to the main component .",
    "clearly , if attenuation of the sed were ignored the distance to each of the minor components would be overestimated and as well as their @xmath205 and @xmath206 contributions . yet , even in this case all the minor components together could only account for a small fraction of @xmath205 and @xmath206 sustained by the main component .     *",

    "there are various consequences of this : ( a ) for a given pair of measured column densities ( and fixed density , chemical composition , and sed ) no more than one solution in @xmath119 and @xmath121 can be found ; ( b ) @xmath119 and @xmath121 and their errors are necessarily correlated ; ( c ) these solutions can be found either graphically or numerically in a way much more efficient than though generic numerical optimization techniques ; ( d ) the graphical nature of the diagnostic allows one to set the observations from various different observers on the same page and gain valuable insights .    in the determination of @xmath210 and @xmath196 traditional plots of predicted column densities vs. @xmath196 as abscissa",
    "have various disadvantages .",
    "this is because for every column density measured there is whole family of solutions ( @xmath210 , @xmath196 ) , thus both parameters must be determined simultaneously .",
    "a typical approach used is to normalize the predicted column densities to the measured columns and then look for the intersection between various curves .",
    "the disadvantages in that is that in dividing theoretical values by measured values mixes up theoretical and observational uncertainties .",
    "further , a solution based on intersections of curves or broad regions , if uncertainties are accounted for in some fashion , offers no simple intuitive understanding of how the results may change in case of systematic effects on either the theoretical modeling or the observations .",
    "by contrast , the plots that we propose here clearly allow one to visualize the error bars of the measurements and their significance relative to the predictions of different models .",
    "one can also visualize how systematic effects on the calculations , like for example chemical composition or shape of the sed , would shift the results of the diagnostics .",
    "another very important advantage of the proposed plots is the potential to put various kinematic components of the same trough on the same plot and compare them under equal conditions .",
    "it is true that the proposed plots do not show the resulting @xmath196 explicitly , but by fixing @xmath210 the whole problem is solved and there is a direct correspondence between the observed column density of observed species and @xmath196 .",
    "thus , @xmath196 can be read directly from the tabulated solutions of the models .",
    "we determined relative distances of the various kinematic components , firstly under the assumption that all components see the same unattenuated sed .",
    "it becomes immediately clear that the component with the largest column density is always the first in line from the source .",
    "once the first kinematic component in line was identified for each object we include the effect of attenuation of the sed on the distance determination for the remaining components .",
    "it was found that distance determinations that ignore attenuation affects are significantly overestimated .",
    "by contrast , when attenuation by the innermost component is considered in the distance estimation all the kinematic components in the absorption troughs are found in close proximity to each other , and possibly related .",
    "this result , if found generally true in most felobal , ought to have important consequences in our understanding of the dynamics and energetics of quasar outflows ."
