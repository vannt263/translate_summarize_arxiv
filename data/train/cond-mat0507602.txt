    "huggins interaction parameter@xcite , and of critical exponents@xcite ",
    "several basic theoretical predictions  @xcite have proven difficult to verify , as they rely on specific assumptions , such as monodisperse and symmetric conditions , in which the solvent interacts equally with both polymer species . while , on the other hand , these conditions can easily be realized in computer simulations , those mostly have focused on polymer demixing in binary blends , i.e. , at relatively high concentrations ( cf .",
    "refs .  ) .",
    "sariban and binder  @xcite have performed pioneering computational work on polymer ",
    "polymer demixing under more dilute conditions , using a simple cubic lattice model .",
    "the fact that little additional computational work appears to have been done since then has motivated us to further explore polymer demixing in the presence of a solvent .",
    "huggins  ( fh ) theory  @xcite predicts that two incompatible polymer species in a nonselective good solvent will phase separate at arbitrary dilution , provided the temperature of the system is sufficiently low . under the appropriate conditions , the phase transition will be continuous and the corresponding critical temperature  @xmath0 is predicted to increase linearly with the total monomer concentration  @xmath1 over the entire concentration range . however , this mean - field approach assumes homogeneous monomer densities for both species and ignores the chain connectivity .",
    "below the dilute ",
    "semidilute threshold  @xmath2 , this connectivity causes individual chains to be separate , swollen coils that do not interpenetrate .",
    "thus , de gennes  @xcite has claimed that _ no phase separation _ occurs for concentrations @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , in the semidilute regime , @xmath4 , each chain can be viewed as a succession of `` blobs , '' where each blob contains several monomers . in a good solvent",
    ", a blob does not contain monomers of other chains due to the excluded - volume interactions .",
    "this reduces the number of contacts between monomers of different species and consequently lowers the critical temperature compared to the fh prediction .",
    "specifically , the critical temperature no longer varies linearly with concentration , but decreases superlinearly with decreasing concentration.@xcite employing renormalization - group  ( rg ) techniques , joanny and co - workers@xcite observed that demixing under good solvent conditions is driven by corrections to scaling .",
    "schfer and kappeler  @xcite calculated the corresponding spinodal by means of an rg approach and found a nonlinear dependence of the critical temperature on concentration that differs from the prediction of ref .  .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite subsequently extended the rg treatment to predict the chain - length dependences of critical amplitudes of the order parameter , zero - angle scattering intensity and the correlation length .",
    "these predictions have partially been tested in ref .  , where the concentration dependence of the critical temperature in the semidilute regime and the chain - length dependence of the critical amplitude of the order parameter have been investigated .",
    "in this paper , we extend the work of ref .   by means of monte carlo simulations in which we employ the bond - fluctuation model  @xcite rather than a simple cubic lattice model .",
    "this model is capable of a more realistic representation of mixtures of flexible chains , as it permits variation of the length of chain segments and a much smoother variation of the angle between successive segments .",
    "we investigate phase separation as a function of total monomer concentration and test the various theoretical predictions for the critical properties , where we also address an alternative scenario leading to a nonlinear variation of the transition temperature with concentration .",
    "in addition , our simulations explicitly cover the transition from the dilute to the semidilute regime in ternary solutions , which requires ( computationally demanding ) calculations in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "following our earlier work  @xcite , we also investigate the effect of this transition on shape properties of individual polymer coils .",
    "the shape variation of polymers upon phase separation is of interest because of its influence on the physical properties of ternary solutions .",
    "as was first recognized by kuhn  @xcite , the shape of a flexible polymer is ellipsoidal rather than spherical .",
    "this may affect , e.g. , the flow properties of polymeric fluids  @xcite and the polymer - induced depletion potential in colloid  polymer mixtures.@xcite furthermore , murat and kremer  @xcite proposed a coarse - grained model for the study of phase separation of polymer blends , in which each coil is replaced by a `` soft '' ellipsoidal particle .",
    "since individual segments are no longer modeled explicitly , this may permit the observation of the demixing process at longer times scales .",
    "however , it also requires accurate knowledge of the actual ellipsoidal shape of the individual chains . for polymer chains in the dilute limit",
    ", corresponding studies have indeed been performed .",
    "olc and stockmayer  @xcite first introduced the radius - of - gyration tensor .",
    "the three eigenvalues of this gyration tensor are the squared principal components of the radius of gyration . from monte carlo simulations of an ideal polymer chain on a cubic lattice",
    ", they found that these three components were very different , implying an asymmetric polymer shape and confirming kuhn s original observation .",
    "the _ asphericity _",
    "@xmath5 was introduced to characterize the coil shape.@xcite it takes values between @xmath6 ( sphere ) and @xmath7 ( rod ) and was calculated for ideal and self - avoiding chains.@xcite since this asphericity does not distinguish prolate - ellipsoid and oblate - ellipsoid shapes , another parameter  @xmath8 was introduced  @xcite and calculated analytically for ideal and self - avoiding chains . however , in order to simplify the calculations for @xmath5 and  @xmath8 ( both of which are defined below ) , expectation values of ratios were replaced by ratios of averages .",
    "this approximation was found to overestimate the asphericity of polymer chains.@xcite numerical calculations  @xcite have supported the analytical calculations . in recent years , it has actually become possible to observe the shape asphericity experimentally.@xcite these experiments , as well as the vast majority of the theoretical work , focus on the shape of a single polymer chain in a highly dilute solution .",
    "studies of the influence of concentration are rare and have essentially shown that the asphericity of athermal chains diminishes only very gradually as a function of increasing concentration.@xcite in a poor solvent , the reverse effect occurs , due to the coil ",
    "globule transition taking place in the polymer - lean phase.@xcite the dependence of polymer shape on both concentration and solvent quality has motivated our earlier study of the shape change of polymers upon phase separation in ternary solutions.@xcite it was found that phase separation strongly influences the shape of the minority component in a given phase . here ,",
    "we expand this work by investigating the temperature dependence of both the asphericity  @xmath5 and the prolate  oblate parameter  @xmath8 at fixed total concentration .",
    "our study consists of three main aspects : ( i )  the scaling of the critical temperature @xmath0 with total monomer concentration @xmath1 and degree of polymerization @xmath9 ; ( ii )  the chain - length dependence of critical amplitudes ; ( iii )  the shape variation of polymers upon phase separation . in this section ,",
    "we provide the necessary theoretical background and review the corresponding predictions .",
    "we consider a monodisperse solution containing polymers of two different species , denoted a and  b , with degree of polymerization @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the solvent is of the same quality for both species , and their chemical potentials are equal .",
    "thus , a so - called _ symmetric _ ternary system is realized , in which both species behave identically . the only distinction between monomers of type  a and monomers of type  b is their mutual repulsion of strength  @xmath11",
    "identical monomers experience an attraction @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , phase separation occurs at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "owing to the symmetric properties of both species , this transition is continuous if the chemical potential difference vanishes .",
    "fh theory , assuming complete screening of the excluded - volume interactions , predicts a linear relation between the corresponding critical temperature @xmath13 and the monomer concentration  @xmath1 ( cf .   ref .  ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",

    "polymer ( pp ) phase separation occurs for arbitrarily low  @xmath1 , provided that the temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "however , in the dilute regime ( @xmath16 ) , the excluded - volume interaction is not screened at all and polymer coils essentially do not interact .",
    "accordingly , de gennes  @xcite argued that no pp phase separation can occur for concentrations below @xmath2 . at the overlap threshold",
    "@xmath2 phase separation can be induced , provided that the segregation factor is sufficiently strong ( or the temperature sufficiently low ) . in the semidilute regime ( @xmath17 ) , the tendency to phase separate is suppressed as well , and demixing will take place at a lower temperature than predicted by fh theory , due to the partial screening of the excluded - volume interaction . according to blob scaling arguments  @xcite , in this regime",
    "each chain can be viewed as a succession of blobs .",
    "each blob only contains monomers of a single species , so that the number of a  b contacts is reduced and phase separation is correspondingly suppressed .",
    "indeed , de gennes has predicted the critical temperature to scale as@xcite @xmath18 alternatively , phase separation can be induced by varying the concentration at a fixed temperature  @xmath19 . at low temperatures",
    ", it follows from the previous argument that the total monomer concentration must be increased to  @xmath2 .",
    "however , if the segregation factor is weak ( i.e. , at high temperatures ) , the homogeneous phase persists into the semidilute regime and separation only occurs at a critical concentration @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scaling exponent for the end - to - end distance  @xmath22 ( or the radius of gyration  @xmath23 ) as a function of @xmath9 in dilute solution .",
    "we observe that @xmath24 exhibits the same chain - length dependence as the overlap threshold  @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , an rg approach  @xcite indicated that for the fixed point corresponding to phase separation under good solvent conditions , the chemical mismatch between a and b is an _",

    "while the results for ps - pi solutions can be viewed as a confirmation of the rg scenario , the agreement between theory and experiment may well be fortuitous , as most data were taken in the concentrated regime where the blob scaling approach is invalid .",
