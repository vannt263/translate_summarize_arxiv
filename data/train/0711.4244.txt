    "tel - aviv university ultra - violet experiment ( tauvex ) is an indo - israeli ultraviolet imaging space mission that will image large parts of the sky in the wavelength region between 1300 and 3200 .",
    "the instrument consists of three equivalent 20-cm uv imaging telescopes with a choice of filters for each telescope .",
    "each telescope has a field of view of about 54 and a spatial resolution of about 6 `` to 10 '' , depending on the wavelength .",
    "tauvex will be launched into a geostationary orbit as part of indian space research organization s gsat-4 mission in april 2008 .",
    "observations will be available using filters in five uv bands :    1 .",
    "bbf : broadband filter ( 13003300 ) 2 .",
    "sf1 : intermediate band filter 1 ( 12502250 ) 3 .",
    "sf2 : intermediate band filter 2 ( 18002600 ) 4 .",
    "sf3 : intermediate band filter 3 ( 21003100 ) 5 .",
    "nbf : narrowband filter ( 20002400 )    figure 1 shows the response curves for each of the tauvex filters in units of effective area @xmath0",
    ".        the tauvex mission will have added advantages as compared to other earlier uv missions like the td satellites and galex etc .",
    "the estimation of the slope @xmath1 of the interstellar extinction curve with a greater sensitivity , will allow to construct deeper maps of the uv sky .",
    "further , tauvex and td satellites would complement each other by having a total of six data points for the interstellar extinction curve for their common sources ( see maheshwar et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "tauvex will mostly operate in scanning mode , since it will be mounted on gsat-4 , a geosynchronous satellite .",
    "the fov will be scanning a strip of the sky with constant declination and a limiting magnitude of 19 ( murthy , 2003 ) .",
    "a few years of successful run of the mission will record more than a million uv point sources apart from galaxies , qso s and the uv background .",
    "the need for an automated classification pipeline for the stellar sources that is repeatable and fast is , therefore , immense .    the artificial neural network ( ann ) based schemes are now being routinely used to classify spectra from large spectral data bases ( gulati et al .",
    "1994 , singh et al .",
    "1998 , 2006 , valdes et al .",
    "2004 , bailer - jones 2002 , gupta et al .",
    "2004 ) for the purpose of sorting these large spectral data base into groups of main spectral types ( o , b , a , f , g , k and m ) and sub - classes .",
    "further , these schemes can also be used for obtaining stellar fundamental atmospheric parameters ( gulati et al .",
    "1997 a , b ) . of these gulati et al .",
    "( 1997b ) is of particular interest , since it was shown that anns can determine the colour excess , i.e. e(b - v ) in units of magnitudes , as an additional parameter when applied to the iue spectral data base .",
    "the current work has used the ann based tools for classifying the iue spectral data base ( reduced to the tauvex band data ) in terms of the spectral types and also hierarchically estimated the color excess using this tool .",
    "it is worth noting that whereas the gulati et al .",
    "( 1997b ) used the iue full spectra for spectral type classification and estimation of colour excess , the present work uses the simulated band data as expected from the tauvex satellite and even with this limitation , the neural network scheme has been able to assign the spectral classes and also obtain reddening estimate to satisfactory levels .",
    "in the next section , we describe the generation and pre - processing of the simulated tauvex data that is used for training of the neural network as well as the processing of the iue spectral data which is used as the test set . in section 3 , we describe results of the ann classification scheme as well as the color excess determination . in section 4",
    ", we present important conclusions of the study .",
    "following sub - sections describe the ann architecture , simulated data generation and the ann train and test sets .",
    "the ann architecture considered here is an supervised one with a minimum configuration of three layers , i.e. , ( 1 ) input layer where the patterns are read ( 2 ) hidden layer where the information is processed from the input layer ( 3 ) output layer where the output patterns are rendered ( see bailer - jones et al .",
    "2002 for a review ) .",
    "the hidden layer can have several nodes which inter - connect the input and output layers with each connection with its designated connection weight .",
    "we have used a back - propagation algorithm ( gulati et al .",
    "1994 , 1997a , b , singh et al .",
    "1998 ) with 2 hidden layers of 64 nodes each and this scheme requires a training session where the ann output and the desired output get compared after each iteration and the connection weights get updated till the desired minimum error threshold is reached . at this stage",
    "the network training is complete and the connection weights are considered frozen .",
    "the next stage is the testing session where the test patterns are fed to the network and output is the classified spectral pattern or color excess in terms of the training sets .    in the actual post launch of tauvex when the real data will be available ,",
    "the scheme applied to estimate the colour excess will have to run the ann in two stages i.e. in a hierarchal manner such that , the first stage classifies the test set ( iue data base or the expected tauvex data base ) into the spectral classes and then a second ann stage performs the colour excess estimation .",
    "we have used two independent sources to generate the training sets of spectra with solar type stars with @xmath2 = 0 $ ] .",
    "one is the stellar flux calculator from tauvex website ( http://tauvex.iiap.res.in/htmls/tools/fluxcalc/ ) containing 286 spectro - luminosity classes and the other is the uvblue fluxes ( rodriguez - merino et al . 2005 ) ( http://www.bo.astro.it/@xmath3eps/uvblue/uvblue.html ) .",
    "based on the spectral type and luminosity class of a star , the tauvex calculator derives the effective temperature and surface gravity using the calibration of allen ( 2000 ) , colina ( 1995 ) and lang ( 1982 ) and calculates the spectral energy distribution for each star using appropriate kurucz model available on the webpage http://kurucz.harvard.edu/ ( see sujatha et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we have used the information from allen ( 2000 ) , erika bohm - vitense ( 1981 ) , johnson ( 1966 ) , ridgway et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and bertone et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for matching the parameter space of uvblue to spectral - types and luminosity classes .",
    "both the sources provide sets of theoretical fluxes ( based on kurucz model atmospheres ) in the uv region .",
    "these fluxes need to be processed via a common flux integration programme provided at the tauvex tools site to form two sets of band data ( each having four fluxes corresponding to the four tauvex bands ) and they constitute the simulated band data set for the ann training sets .",
    "we have also obtained two sets of fluxes ( with 50   resolution and 40 data bins covering the spectral region of 12503220 ) aimed at preparing the ann tools for another indian scientific mission satellite astrosat ( http://www.rri.res.in/astrosat/ ) which will have gratings to provide slit - less spectra for spatially resolved stars .",
    "it will also prepare us for the future gaia mission ( http://gaia.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=26 ) .      while making the train and test sets",
    ", one has to ensure that the number of spectral fluxes at the respective wavelengths and the starting / ending wavelengths are identical .",
    "also the spectral resolution needs to be same and for this , the spectral libraries had to be convolved with appropriate gaussian functions to bring them at par with each other .",
    "the fluxes are normalized to unity with respect to maximum flux in each spectrum before sending to the ann inputs .",
    "the spectra for 286 tauvex spectral types generated in the range 1250 - 3200   have a resolution of 10   which we have degraded to 50  .",
    "the resolution of 277 uvblue spectral types have been degraded similarly ( using the relevant codes provided on the uvblue library web site ) .",
    "these sets of data are then reddened ( using the observed extinction curve of seaton , 1979 ) in the range of 0.00 - 1.00 mag , for preparing the training sets for the two stages of the hierarchal scheme viz . the separation of the different spectral types and the evaluation of reddening values .",
    "below we provide the details of the procedure adopted for generating the training sets for the two stages :    * * generating data set for spectral type determination : * + in the first stage , reddening values are added in step sizes of 0.20 magnitudes to the simulated data .",
    "the 0.20 step is chosen for the computational convenience .",
    "for example , the tauvex data consists of 286 different classes with 58 spectral types , each having 5 luminosity classes ( except for o6.5v ) . if one wants to classify the spectral type , luminosity class and the reddening value in a single run ; reddening these 286 data sets with reddening value from 0.00 - 1.00 , even at a step of 0.1 leads to @xmath4= 3146 number of distinct classes .",
    "however , this is not possible with our current computational facilities and the present version of our ann .",
    "instead , we go for the hierarchal scheme by first merging all the luminosity classes . for example , instead of considering o3i - o3v as five separate classes , the ann will be trained to learn all the five different patterns as single o3 spectral type only , though the variation in all the five spectra still go as input to the ann .",
    "the process thus reduces the number of distinct classes from 286 to only 58 classes , making the computation fast .",
    "when the learning process is completed , ann can separate different spectral types , thus making it possible to find out the reddening values in the next stage . * * generating data set for reddening * evaluation : + in the second stage , reddening values are added in step sizes of 0.05 to the simulated data .",
    "the separation of the available spectra into different groups o , b , a , f , g , k etc . in the first stage , makes it possible to select this finer step size of 0.05 . in our work",
    "we have not classified the luminosity classes separately , however , this can be done easily by adding one more stage in the hierarchal scheme .    a sample of normalized simulated spectra of different spectral types is shown in fig .",
    "their integrated fluxes in the four tauvex bands , nbf , sf1 , sf2 and sf3 , have been computed using respective filter response curves of fig.1 .",
    "3 shows the residuals obtained by subtracting iue fluxes from the corresponding tauvex simulated fluxes .",
    "the discrepancies observed in these figures could be due the following reasons :    in the early - type stars i.e. o and b , the main discrepancy between observed and theoretical is near 1500 .",
    "this is a consequence of the physical origin of the c line , which gets strongly affected by stellar winds and mass - loss processes in massive stars . for f - type stars the metallic features at 2400(fe iii ) , 2500(fe i / si i ) , 2800(mg ii ) are more enhanced in the simulated spectra",
    ". for g - type stars the chromospheric activities increases and thus triggers prominent mg core emissions which are not seen in the simulated spectra .",
    "the chromospheric activities are not accounted for in the kurucz s model ( rodriguez - merino et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is more clearly visible in the band integration of the fluxes of late type stars in fig .",
    "the final training set thus contains ( a ) the spectra in the form shown in fig . 2 and ( b ) 4 flux values in the 4 bands of tauvex in the form shown in fig .",
    "3  for each of the 286 tauvex spectra ( 277 spectra for the uvblue case ) with reddening in the range of 0.00 to 1.00 mag with a step of 0.2 mag . fig .",
    "4 shows a block diagram of the flow chart for preparing these two training sets for spectral type classification .            [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "till now several studies have demonstrated that the artificial neural network schemes can reliably and successfully classify stellar spectral data as well as extract fundamental stellar parameters in the visible region .",
    "the extension of applicability of this scheme to uv region has been less prevalent mainly because of non - availability of abundant data in this region .",
    "nevertheless , some attempts have been made in the past to automate the process of classification of spectral data from the iue satellite . in this paper , we have demonstrated that the artificial neural networks can be successfully employed to classify stellar photometric ( band ) data .",
    "we have shown that the ann tools developed by us can successfully classify the 229 iue spectra reduced to the four tauvex bands to an accuracy in the range of 3 - 4 sub - spectral types .",
    "we have also estimated the colour excess for the hot stars ( o , b and a types ) to an accuracy of up to 0.1 magnitudes in terms of e(b - v ) colours .",
    "thus , even with the limitation of data from just photometric bands , anns have not only classified the stars , but also provided satisfactory estimates for interstellar extinction .",
    "we hope that our automated pipeline will be used extensively to extract and validate data from virtual observatories as well as for the upcoming satellite data base expected from the tauvex and also the astrosat and gaia missions where one will be able to provide the interstellar extinction maps of our galaxy and which in turn could be modeled for dust distribution ( vaidya et al .",
