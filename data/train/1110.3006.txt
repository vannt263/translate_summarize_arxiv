    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas has been intensively studied for several decades .",
    "the interest is stimulated by the clear manifestations of strong electron correlations including quantum phase transitions ( like wigner crystallization@xmath8@xcite ) and , in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field , to various features in electron transport gathered under the name `` fractional quantum hall effect''.@xcite transport phenomena , although of paramount significance for applications , provide only indirect information on such fundamental characteristics as quantum states and the energy spectrum , where optical techniques give much more immediate information .",
    "in particular , raman scattering , starting from the pioneering works of a. pinczuk _ et al_,@xcite has been successfully used to study collective excitations in two - dimensional electron gas created in semiconductor heterostructures and quantum wells ( see also ref . and references therein ) . the position and intensities of corresponding raman or luminescence lines",
    "can yield information on the energy and oscillator strengths of the excited states .",
    "meanwhile an important characteristic of such excitations is also the life - time .",
    "this may be estimated by observation of the resonance line widths : for example the spin wave life - time was deduced from the observed width of the esr resonance lines.@xcite .",
    "microwave and optical linewidths are not , however , directly related to the life - time , and usually provide only a very rough lower bound for this quantity . in consequence one is forced to use combined experimental methods including a time - resolved technique ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . despite these experimental difficulties , growing",
    "interest in the problem of excitation life - times in a two - dimensional electron gas has been observed in recent years .",
    "one should mention , for example , recent experimental works on the observation of the spin relaxation in a polarized two - dimensional electron gas based on the kerr rotation effect.@xcite    we study in this work the so - called quantum hall ferromagnet where all two - dimensional electron gas electrons of the upper , partially filled landau level , are in the ground state , with spins aligned along the magnetic field .",
    "this state obviously arises at odd integer fillings : @xmath9.@xcite in addition , experiments and semi - phenomenological theories show that at some fractional fillings , namely at @xmath10 , electrons in the ground state occupy only one spin sub - level , and thereby the fractional quantum hall ferromagnet state is also realized.@xcite the quantum hall ferromagnet possesses a macroscopically large spin @xmath11 oriented in the direction of the field @xmath12 due to negative @xmath13-factor in gaas structures .",
    "the spin wave in the quantum hall ferromagnet may be defined as a purely electronic collective excitation within the landau level which corresponds to a change of the spin numbers by one : @xmath14 and does not alter the spin _ orientation _ of the system .",
    "( another possible excitation in the quantum hall ferromagnet is a goldstone mode representing a deviation of @xmath11 from the @xmath12 direction which does not change the @xmath15 number;@xcite then the microscopic excitation would be a `` zero spin exciton '' corresponding to the spin change @xmath16 , but @xmath17 . )",
    "this spin wave is also called the spin exciton , because this excitation promotes an electron to another spin sub - level of the same landau level and thus an effective hole appears in the initial sub - level .",
    "every spin exciton possesses energy@xmath18@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the zeeman gap ( @xmath21 in a gaas structure ) ; @xmath22 is the spin exciton coulomb correlation energy depending on the 2d wave vector modulus @xmath23 . for the rest of the paper it will be sufficient to consider only long wave excitations , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the magnetic length ) , for which the spectrum is quadratic : @xmath26 here the spin - exciton mass @xmath27 has the dimensionality of inverse energy.@xcite",
    "this quantity has recently been measured experimentally , for @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 fillings.@xcite    if there are an excessive number of spin excitons compared with equilibrium , then the spin relaxation reduces to an elementary process of spin exciton annihilation .",
    "the spin numbers are changed in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) , where the energy of the annihilated excitation can be transferred to the emitted acoustic phonon or to another exciton due to the spin - exciton - spin - exciton scattering .",
    "any spin exciton relaxation channel is thus determined by two necessary conditions : by the availability of an interaction that does not conserve the spin of the electron gas , and by a mechanism of energy dissipation making the relaxation process irreversible . until now , spin - orbit coupling has been assumed to be the cause of the spin non - conservation ( see , e.g. , refs . and the works cited therein ) . indeed these spin - orbit relaxation channels",
    "are certainly dominant under the usual experimental conditions , where @xmath30k and @xmath31 t .",
    "the corresponding calculations are in satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data . here",
    "we shall extend the study of spin relaxation channels to include spin non - conservation by the hyperfine coupling to nuclei of the gaas matrix .",
    "this has been considered previously@xmath18@xcite only for the case of the goldstone mode @xmath32 ; here we consider non - zero , but small @xmath23 .",
    "our analysis shows that one mechanism in particular , relating to the spin - exciton - spin - exciton scattering process , should be taken into account , if @xmath33k and magnetic fields @xmath34t.@xcite ( specifically , the necessary condition is @xmath35 . ) to see this clearly we will analyse the spin - orbit relaxation channels  two of them can compete with the hyperfine coupling relaxation in the same region of temperature and magnetic fields .",
    "it should also be noted that the spin relaxation processes proceed much more slowly than other two - dimensional electron gas plasma relaxations unrelated to a spin change .",
    "this means that in any case an elementary spin exciton annihilation / creation process may be studied as a transition ( induced by a perturbation ) from an initial eigen state @xmath36 to a final eigenstate @xmath37 ; i.e. the hyperfine coupling relaxation mechanisms are governed , like the spin - orbit coupling relaxation,@xcite by the fermi golden rule probability @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a relevant matrix element .    in principle , the hyperfine coupling effects are weak . the spin - orbit coupling and the hyperfine coupling both have relativistic origins : the former is of the first order , but the latter represents the second order relativistic correction to the hamiltonian . however , the hyperfine interaction has some essential properties different from those of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "these substantially change kinematic conditions of the spin exciton scattering and the dissipation mechanisms where one of spin excitons annihilates .",
    "we shall see that ( i ) first , the hyperfine coupling does not conserve total momentum of the electron system , and this feature leads to extension of the phase volume for the spin - exciton - spin - exciton and spin - exciton - phonon scatterings ; ( ii ) second , the spin - flip process governed be the hyperfine interaction does not require a virtual promotion of an electron to another landau level ( this promotion with simultaneous spin - flip is a characteristic feature of the spin - orbit coupling and means a virtual conversion of the spin exciton into the cyclotron magnetoplasmon ) . as a result ,",
    "a new annihilation channel of the spin exciton scattering appears : two spin excitons can be scattered by each other , within the same landau level , directly due to the hyperfine interaction  finally one gets a single - spin exciton state possessing the combined energy .",
    "this kind of scattering , as in the case of scattering caused by disorder , @xcite is kinematic : the transition matrix element does not contain the coulomb constant between bra- and ket - vectors  the scattering is possible because the spin excitons are not actually elementary bose particles but possess an internal degree of freedom and thus have a `` memory '' of the pauli principle for the primary electron system .",
    "thus in spite of small hyperfine coupling constant , the hyperfine coupling channel competes with the spin - orbit ones and can even dominate .    the next section of the paper",
    "is devoted to formal description of the system where we present the hamiltonian and the basis of exciton states ( excitonic representation ) . in section iii",
    "we study the hyperfine coupling relaxation mechanisms when the spin exciton annihilation / creation is determined by the spin - exciton - spin - exciton scattering including the dynamic and kinematic scattering channels .",
    "for this process the relaxation rate is proportional to the spin - exciton number squared , and therefore the relaxation is non - exponential with time .",
    "( in principle , it becomes exponential when the spin exciton number approaches its equilibrium value , but the final exponential stage can not , in fact , be observed under the condition @xmath35 . )",
    "we discuss also in sec .",
    "iii possible relaxation processes , related to the hyperfine coupling and phonon emission / absorption , comparing them with other relaxation mechanisms .",
    "section iv is devoted to the spin - orbit relaxation channels relevant to the considered region of strong magnetic fields and low temperatures .",
    "these spin - orbit mechanisms are also related to the spin - exciton - spin - exciton scattering but determined by two different dissipation processes  via coupling to a smooth random potential or by coupling to phonons .    in sec .",
    "v we discuss the results of our study .",
    "the main result consists of the interplay of different relaxation processes .",
    "we compare those due to the hyperfine coupling and spin - orbit interactions and , summing all relaxation channels , calculate the total characteristic inverse time . in this `` interplay regime '' , where the spin - exciton - spin - exciton channels dominate",
    ", the relaxation occurs non - exponentially , and the effective relaxation time reaches its maximum @xmath40 depending on the landau level fillings . nevertheless , the relevant region of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath41 is not too extreme and experimentally quite accessible .",
    "note that in this paper we do not study the situation where the goldstone condensate of `` zero spin - excitons '' arises,@xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ where there would be a rotation of the _ direction _ but not a reduction in the _ magnitude _ of the total spin of the system . here",
    "we consider instead relaxation where there are , at low temperatures a bulk number of spin excitons arising from an intensive external ( e.g. , optical ) excitation .",
    "the initial state at low temperatures should be described as a ( metastable )  thermodynamic condensate \" of spin waves with non - zero , but small wave - vectors limited by the uncertainty determined by disorder.@xcite we think that such situation , where most of the spin exciton annihilation / creation events happen within the thermodynamic condensate , is realisable experimentally .",
    "our system consists of two components : electrons belonging to the two - dimensional electron gas and nuclei of ga and as atoms . in addition , we consider piezo- and deformation couplings of the 2d electron gas electrons to the lattice , which are reduced to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "so , the hamiltonian used is as follows : @xmath42 here @xmath43 $ ] is single electron hamiltonian including the spin - orbit coupling part ( @xmath44 ) ; @xmath45 ; subscript @xmath46 labels electrons .",
    "the third term describes coulomb energy of the _ e - e _ interaction , the fourth is the hyperfine interaction of electrons with nuclei , and the fifth is the operator of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "if one holds @xmath47 , we can omit the orbital single electron energy terms  all states relevant to our problem belong to the same landau level , and therefore have the same orbital energy equal to @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath50 is the landau level degeneracy ) . we ignore also the energy of nuclei which consists of the contribution due to their interaction independent of the electrons , and of the nuclear zeeman energy .",
    "variations of both , associated with change of nuclear spins , are negligibly small owing to the tiny nuclear magnetic momentum .    in the following three subsections ( a , b , and c ) we neglect the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the spin - orbit hamiltonian and spin - orbit corrections , written in terms of the representation used , will be given in the subsection d.      we now present the basis set of states diagonalizing the first three terms of the hamiltonian [ tot_ham ] to leading order in parameter @xmath51 considered to be small ( @xmath52 is the averaged form - factor arising due to finiteness of the 2d layer thickness ; @xmath53 is the dielectric constant ) .",
    "we do this by analogy with previous works,@xcite defining the spin exciton creation operator@xmath18@xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the fermi annihilation operators corresponding to electron states on the upper landau level with spin up ( @xmath57 ) and spin down ( @xmath58 ) , respectively .",
