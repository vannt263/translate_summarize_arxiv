    "we consider pure su(n ) , @xmath6 , lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) with the wilson action ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath7 where the sum is over all plaquettes of a 4d hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath8 is the su(n ) plaquette variable , @xmath9 the bare coupling constant and @xmath10 the usual convention , which emphasizes the interpretation as a 4d statistical mechanics , but gives up the @xmath11 relation with the physical temperature .",
    "namely , @xmath12 holds in lgt , where the integer @xmath13 is the extension of the lattice in euclidean time and @xmath3 is the lattice spacing .    for every physical observable @xmath14 with the dimensions of a mass the relation @xmath15 holds in the continuum limit @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath4 sets the mass scale of the lattice regularization and @xmath18 are calculable constants .",
    "their actual computation faces difficulties , because one has to rely on simulations at finite lattice spacings @xmath19 , introducing corrections to the continuum relation .",
    "the subject of a good reference scale arises .",
    "this topic gained renewed interest after lscher @xcite introduced the yang - mills gradient flow scale , @xmath20 , which comes by now in several variants .",
    "as anticipated by sommer in his review of the subject @xcite , gradient scales allow for an unprecedented precision , when compared with traditional scales like @xmath21 or @xmath22 @xcite defined by the force between static quarks at intermediate distance .    in recent work asakawa",
    "@xcite pushed estimates for gradient scales in su(3 ) gauge theory all the way up to @xmath23 .",
    "the su(3 ) deconfining phase transition defines another precise scale , second only to gradient scales .",
    "francis et al .",
    "@xcite managed to extend estimates of the su(3 ) transition temperature @xmath24 from lattice sizes of previously @xmath25 up to @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "remarkably , neither asakawa et al .  nor",
    "francis et al .",
    "fit the @xmath10 dependence of their estimates so that there is a @xmath17 continuum limit as predicted by the universal part of asymptotic scaling . instead ,",
    "a parametrization for a limited @xmath10 range is used and the continuum limit of ratios is subsequently estimated by fits in variables like @xmath28 , @xmath29 and so on .",
    "this is in accord with a majority of publications on the subject , which all have given up on approaching the asymptotic scaling limit .",
    "reasons for this , and why the decision to give up on asymptotic scaling may have been premature , are outlined in section  [ sec_asf ] .",
    "inspired by an earlier approach of allton @xcite , we are led to write the corrections to the mass relation ( [ m ] ) as a simple taylor series in the lattice spacing times the lambda lattice mass scale , @xmath5 . in section  [ sec_dat",

    "@xcite and @xcite ( see the abstract ) .",
    "summary and conclusions follow in the final section  [ sec_sum ] .",
    "the realization that the continuum limit of lgt may not just in theory but in practice be reached by computer simulations started with a paper by creutz @xcite , where he observed for the su(2 ) string tension @xmath30 a cross - over from its strong coupling behavior @xmath31 to the 1-loop asymptotic scaling behavior @xmath32 .",
    "as the accuracy of markov chain monte carlo calculations improved , it was soon realized that there were , in particular for su(3 ) with the wilson action , strong violations of the asymptotic scaling relation and this did not improve noticeably by moving from the 1-loop to the 2-loop relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are , respectively , the universal 1-loop @xcite and 2-loop @xcite coefficients of asymptotic freedom , called asymptotic scaling in our context .",
    "universal means that all renormalization schemes lead to the same @xmath36 and @xmath37 coefficients .",
    "next , the hope appeared to be that the situation would improve by including further , non - universal , terms of the expansion of @xmath5 : @xmath38 computing up to 3-loops , alls et al .",
    "@xcite calculated @xmath39 for su(n ) lgt , @xmath40 but , the discrepancies between the asymptotic scaling equation and data for physical quantities did not improve .",
    "assuming that lattice artifacts are responsible for the disagreements , allton @xcite suggested to include such corrections while constraining them with results from perturbative expansions of the considered operators and actions . doubting , due to uncertainties with the very definition of non - trivial continuum functional integrals , that perturbative information beyond eq .",
    "( [ fla ] ) is reliable , a general taylor series expansion in @xmath5 is proposed here for corrections to eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , @xmath41 where one has to determine the normalization constants @xmath18 and the expansion coefficients @xmath42 by computer simulations .",
    "this has the potential to eliminate the essential singularity of the perturbative expansion at @xmath43 .",
    "however , the full sum ( [ fla ] ) for @xmath44 is not available .",

    "nevertheless , we continue to use ( [ mal ] ) with @xmath53 replaced by @xmath49 and come back to these issues after presenting the fits .    in the following we consider observables with the dimension of a length , @xmath61 and rewrite ( [ mal ] ) as @xmath62^{-1}\\ , \\\\",

    "it just developed this way out of ref .",
    "@xcite . to determine the expansion parameters @xmath63 by numerical calculations",
    "one has to truncate the sum at rather small values of @xmath64 . for sufficiently large @xmath10 this should work well because @xmath65 falls for all @xmath54 exponentially off with @xmath17 .",

    "the labels @xmath70 on the normalization constants @xmath71 and parameters @xmath63 indicate that their values depend on the choice of @xmath70 . for simplicity",
    "the labels will be dropped when the association is obvious .    for @xmath47 as well as for @xmath48",
    "it turns out that excellent fits are obtained using @xmath72 parameters @xmath63 besides the @xmath71 normalization constants . in the following we present @xmath73 , @xmath74 , expansions for the yang - mills gradient flow data @xcite and for the deconfining transition estimates  @xcite",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for ratios , @xmath76 , of the normalization constants these differences become tiny and are swallowed by the statistical error bars as is seen in table  [ tab_rat ] for @xmath77 ( columns are arranged as in table  [ tab_norm ] ) .",
    "the deconfining transition is used as reference scale , because @xmath78 is statistically independent from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",

    "@xcite . using @xmath48 , our values @xmath81 and @xmath82 are both well consistent with @xmath83 as given in their table  3 .",
    "our value from column  3 is inconsistent with the precise estimate given in their eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) , @xmath84 .",
    "the discrepancy may be well explained by the small bias of our result and/or the fact that asakawa et al .",
    "rely entirely on @xmath85 , whereas here a continuum fit is used that gives weight to all lattices , including @xmath86 to 22 .",
    "the @xmath87 of the fits ( [ qfits ] ) are not sensitive to including or not including the @xmath88 term into the scaling function ( [ flaq ] ) , while there is a remarkable shift in the normalization constants .",
    "it is then tempting , but entirely wrong , to argue that the @xmath1 dependence is so weak that it does not matter and one could replace @xmath88 by a constant , say @xmath89 for our @xmath10 range .",
    "it is easy to see that with this , or any other @xmath90 , the normalization constants of the @xmath47 fits will not change at all .",
    "so , the shift in the normalization constants comes entirely from the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath39 term .",
    "these contributions re - sum in a way that they become for large @xmath10 responsible for the difference between @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "we use our fits of all @xmath91 data to illuminate the situation by fig .",
    "[ fig_pd ] , where for @xmath74 the inverse asymptotic scaling functions @xmath92 and their @xmath73 fits are plotted times @xmath93 , i.e. , as fractions of the inverse 3-loop asymptotic scaling function @xmath69 .",
    "we see that the gap between the @xmath68 and @xmath69 asymptotic scaling functions narrows slowly and the fits @xmath94 and @xmath95 approach rapidly ( exponentially fast for increasing @xmath10 ) their respective asymptotic behaviors , where the @xmath95 fit stays closer to its asymptotic form than the @xmath96 fit : @xmath97 over the entire @xmath10 range of the figure ..    how does it come that the data can not figure out whether the @xmath47 or @xmath48 fit is better ?",
    "the answer lies in their ratios : if the ratio of the two fits is a constant , the difference between them will be entirely absorbed by the normalization . defining the change in the ratios with respect to @xmath98 as reference point by @xmath99 we find for the asymptotic scaling ( @xmath100 ) functions a change by 3.2% at @xmath23 . with 0.16%",
    "it is twenty times smaller for the fits ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "what is then the effect of including more and more @xmath101 terms in the expansion ( [ fla ] ) of @xmath53 ?",
    "we may expect convergence of the resulting normalization constants @xmath71 towards their correct value .",
    "but how fast ? repeating the fits of all data with fake @xmath102 functions ( [ flaq ] ) defined by @xmath103 , so that @xmath50 has a similar absolute value as @xmath39 , there is again no sensitivity of the @xmath87 of the fits for the additional term and corrections to the @xmath71 normalization constants stay less than @xmath104% . on this basis",
    "we end up with the result that our most reliable estimates of the @xmath71 are those of column five of table  [ tab_norm ] with a mainly systematic uncertainty of @xmath104% . from @xmath105",
    "we get @xmath106 in good agreement with francis et al .",
    "@xcite , who give @xmath107 .",
    "using standard relations between lambda scales @xcite this becomes @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , our estimate for @xmath109 , @xmath110 is in agreement with the one of table  3 of asakawa et al .",
    "@xcite and the more accurate value of their eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) , which translate , respectively , into @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "when we believe in the pad approximation of @xcite , we find @xmath113 , which is in magnitude almost ten times smaller than the range we allowed for our estimate of the systematic error .",
    "using then fits with @xmath114 as reference , eq .",
    "( [ ttl ] ) and ( [ l6 ] ) improve to @xmath115 where contributions of the statistical errors exceed now the systematic errors .",
    "so , it is difficult to understand why the error in eq .",
    "3.3 of asakawa et al .  is much smaller .",
