    "the origin of grbs , bursts of 0.1 mev1 mev photons lasting for a few seconds , remained unknown for over 20 years , primarily because grbs were not detected prior to 1997 at wave - bands other than @xmath0-rays ( see @xcite for review of @xmath0-ray observations ) .",
    "the isotropic distribution of bursts over the sky suggested that grb sources lie at cosmological distances , and general phenomenological considerations were used to argue that the bursts are produced by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistic expanding fireball ( see @xcite for review ) .    adopting the cosmological fireball hypothesis ,",
    "it was shown that the physical conditions in the fireball dissipation region allow fermi acceleration of protons to energy @xmath11 @xcite , and that the average rate at which energy is emitted as @xmath0-rays by grbs is comparable to the energy generation rate of uhecrs in a model where uhecrs are produced by a cosmological distribution of sources @xcite .",
    "based on these two facts , it was suggested that grbs and uhecrs have a common origin ( see @xcite for review ) .    in the last two years , afterglows of grbs have been discovered in x - ray , optical , and radio wave bands ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "afterglow observations confirmed the cosmological origin of the bursts , through the redshift determination of several grb host - galaxies ( see @xcite for an updated list ) , and confirmed @xcite standard model predictions @xcite of afterglows that result from the collision of an expanding fireball with its surrounding medium .",
    "these observations therefore provide strong support for the grb model of uhecr production .    in this review , uhecr and neutrino production in grbs",
    "is discussed in the light of recent grb and uhecr observations .",
    "the fireball model is briefly described in  2.1 , and proton acceleration in grb fireballs is discussed in  2.2 .",
    "recent claims , according to which protons can not be accelerated to @xmath2  ev in the fireball @xcite , are shown in  2.2 to be erroneous .",
    "implications of recent afterglow observations to high energy particle production are discussed in  3 .",
    "it is shown that , contrary to some recent claims @xcite , the grb energy generation rate implied by afterglow observations is similar to the energy generation rate required to account for the flux of @xmath1  ev cosmic - rays .",
    "model predictions are shown to be consistent with the observed uhecr spectrum in  4 .",
    "predictions of the grb model for uhecr production , that can be tested with future uhecr experiments , are discussed in  5 .",
    "implications of the detection by the agasa experiment of multiple high energy events with consistent arrival directions @xcite is also discussed in  5 .",
    "high energy neutrino production in fireballs and its implications for future high energy neutrino detectors are discussed in  6 .",
    "in the fireball model of grbs @xcite , a compact source , of linear scale @xmath12  cm , produces a wind characterized by an average luminosity @xmath13 and mass loss rate @xmath14 . at small radius ,",
    "the wind bulk lorentz factor , @xmath15 , grows linearly with radius , until most of the wind energy is converted to kinetic energy and @xmath15 saturates at @xmath16 .",
    "variability of the source on time scale @xmath17 , resulting in fluctuations in the wind bulk lorentz factor @xmath15 on similar time scale , then leads to internal shocks @xcite in the expanding fireball at a radius @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20  ms .",
    "if the lorentz factor variability within the wind is significant , internal shocks would reconvert a substantial part of the kinetic energy to internal energy .",
    "it is assumed that this energy is then radiated as @xmath0-rays by synchrotron and inverse - compton emission of shock - accelerated electrons .    in this model ,",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray variability time , @xmath21 , reflects the variability time of the underlying source , and the grb duration , @xmath22s , reflects the duration over which energy is emitted from the source . a large fraction of bursts detected by batse show variability on the shortest resolved time scale , @xmath23  ms @xcite , and some show variability on shorter time scales , @xmath24  ms @xcite .",
    "this sets the constraint on underlying source size , @xmath25  cm .",
    "the wind must be expanding relativistically , with a lorentz factor @xmath26 , in order that the fireball pair - production optical depth be small for observed high energy , @xmath27  mev , grb photons @xcite .",
    "the wind lorentz factor is expected to fluctuate on time scales ranging from the source dynamical time , @xmath17 , to the wind duration @xmath28 , leading to internal collisions over a range of radii , @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "internal shocks are generally expected to be `` mildly '' relativistic in the fireball rest frame , i.e. characterized by lorentz factor @xmath31 , since adjacent shells within the wind are expected to expand with lorentz factors which do not differ by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "as the fireball expands , it drives a relativistic shock ( blastwave ) into the surrounding gas . at early time , the fireball is little affected by this external interaction . at late time , most of the fireball energy is transferred to the surrounding gas , and the flow approaches self - similar expansion . for typical fireball parameters ,",
    "the transition to self - similar expansion occurs at a radius @xmath30 . at this radius ,",
    "mildly relativistic reverse shocks propagate into the fireball ejecta and decelerate it @xcite .",
    "the reverse shocks disappear on ( observed ) times scale @xmath28 , and the flow becomes self - similar at later time , with a single , relativistic decelerating shock propagating into the surrounding medium .",
    "plasma conditions in the reverse shocks are similar to those of internal shocks arising from variability on time scale @xmath32 , since both are mildly relativistic and occur at similar radii . in the discussion that follows we",
    "therefore do not discuss the reverse shocks separately from the internal shocks .",
    "the shock driven into the ambient medium continuously heats new gas , and accelerates relativistic electrons that may produce by synchrotron emission the delayed radiation , `` afterglow , '' observed on time scales of days to months . as the shock - wave decelerates , the emission shifts with time to lower frequency .      in the fireball model",
    ", the observed grb and afterglow radiation is produced by synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons . in the region where electrons are accelerated , protons are also expected to be shock accelerated .",
    "this is similar to what is thought to occur in supernovae remnant shocks @xcite .",
    "we consider below proton acceleration in internal ( and reverse ) fireball shocks .",
    "since the internal shocks are mildly relativistic , we expect results related to particle acceleration in sub - relativistic shocks ( see , e.g. , @xcite for review ) to be valid for the present scenario .",
    "in particular , the predicted energy distribution of accelerated protons is @xmath33 .",
    "two constraints must be satisfied by fireball wind parameters in order to allow proton acceleration to @xmath34  ev in internal shocks @xcite : @xmath35 and @xmath36 here , @xmath37  ev , @xmath38 is the @xmath0-ray luminosity , @xmath39 is the fraction of the wind energy density which is carried by magnetic field , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the fraction of wind energy carried by shock accelerated electrons . since the electron synchrotron cooling time is short compared to the wind expansion time , electrons lose their energy radiatively and @xmath42 is related to the observed @xmath0-ray luminosity by @xmath43",
    ". the first condition must be satisfied in order for the proton acceleration time @xmath44 to be smaller than the wind expansion time",
    ". the second condition must be satisfied in order for the synchrotron energy loss time of the proton to be larger than @xmath44 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xi_b ] ) and ( [ eq : g_min ] ) , we infer that a dissipative ultra - relativistic wind , with luminosity and variability time implied by grb observations , satisfies the constraints necessary to allow the acceleration of protons to energy @xmath2  ev , provided that the wind bulk lorentz factor is large enough , @xmath45 , and that the magnetic field is close to equipartition with electrons .",
    "the former condition , @xmath45 , is remarkably similar to that inferred based on @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "there is no theory at present that allows a basic principles calculation of the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "however , magnetic field close to equipartition , @xmath46 , is required in order to account for the observed @xmath0-ray emission ( see also  3 ) .",
    "we have assumed in the discussion so far that the fireball is spherically symmetric .",
    "however , since a jet - like fireball behaves as if it were a conical section of a spherical fireball as long as the jet opening angle is larger than @xmath47 , our results apply also for a jet - like fireball ( we are interested only in processes that occur when the wind is ultra - relativistic , @xmath26 , prior to significant fireball deceleration ) .",
    "for a jet - like wind , @xmath42 in our equations should be understood as the luminosity the fireball would have carried had it been spherically symmetric .",
    "it has recently been pointed out in @xcite that conditions at the _ external , highly relativistic _",
    "shock driven by the fireball into the ambient gas are not likely to allow proton acceleration to ultra - high energy . although correct , this observation is irrelevant to the scenario considered here based on @xcite , since in this scenario protons are accelerated in _ internal , mildly relativistic _ fireball shocks .",
    "in addition to providing support to the validity of the qualitative fireball scenario described in  2.1 @xcite , afterglow observations provide quantitative constraints on fireball model parameters .",
    "the determination of grb redshifts implies that the characteristic grb @xmath0-ray luminosity and emitted energy , in the 0.05 to 2  mev band , are @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) , an order of magnitude higher than the values assumed prior to afterglow detection ( here , and throughout the paper , we assume an open universe , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ) .",
    "the increased grb luminosity scale implies that the constraint ( [ eq : xi_b ] ) on the fireball magnetic field is less stringent than previously assumed .",
    "due to present technical limitations of the experiments , afterglow radiation is observed in most cases only on time scale @xmath53  s. at this stage , radiation is produced by the external shock driven into the surrounding gas , and afterglow observations therefore do not provide direct constraints on the magnetic field energy fraction @xmath39 at the internal and reverse shocks , where protons are accelerated to ultra - high energy . in one case , however , that of grb  990123 , reverse shock emission was detected over @xmath23  s time scale @xcite . for this case ,",
    "the inferred value of @xmath39 @xcite is consistent with the constraint ( [ eq : xi_b ] ) .",
    "clearly , more observations are required to determine whether this condition is generally satisfied .",
    "the observed grb redshift distribution implies a grb rate of @xmath54 at @xmath55 .",
    "the present , @xmath56 , rate is less well constrained , since most observed grbs originate at redshifts @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "present data are consistent with both no evolution of grb rate with redshift , and with strong evolution ( following , e.g. , the luminosity density evolution of qsos or the evolution of star formation rate ) , in which @xmath58 @xcite . the energy observed in @xmath0-rays reflect the fireball energy in accelerated electrons .",
    "afterglow observations imply that accelerated electrons and protons carry similar energy @xcite .",
    "thus , the inferred @xmath56 rate of cosmic - ray production by grbs is similar to the generation rate of @xmath0-ray energy , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is in the range of @xmath24 to @xmath61 .",
    "this energy generation rate is remarkably similar to that implied by the observed uhecr flux ( see  4 ) .",
    "grb @xmath0-ray energy generation rate is much smaller , @xmath62 .",
    "most of the discrepancy between this result and our result can be accounted for by noting two errors made in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite : estimating the energy generation rate as the product of the grb rate and the _ median _ , rather than _ average _ , grb energy , and using ( following @xcite ) the grb energy observed in the 50 to 300  kev band , where only a small fraction of the 0.05 to 2  mev @xmath0-ray energy is observed . ]",
    "fly s eye @xcite and agasa @xcite results confirm the flattening of the cosmic - ray spectrum at @xmath63  ev ,    evidence for which existed in previous experiments with weaker statistics @xcite .",
    "fly s eye data is well fitted in the energy range @xmath64  ev to @xmath65  ev by a sum of two power laws : a steeper component , with differential number spectrum @xmath66 , dominating at lower energy , and a shallower component , @xmath67 , dominating at higher energy , @xmath68  ev . the flattening of the spectrum , combined with the lack of anisotropy and the evidence for a change in composition from heavy nuclei at low energy to light nuclei ( protons ) at high energy @xcite , suggest that an extra - galactic source of protons dominates the flux at high energy @xmath68  ev .    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the uhecr spectrum , reported by the fly s eye @xcite , the yakutsk @xcite , and the agasa @xcite experiments , with that predicted by the grb model . the proton generation rate is assumed to evolve in redshift following qso luminosity evolution @xcite .",
    "note , that the cosmic - ray spectrum at energy @xmath1  ev is little affected by modifications of the cosmological parameters or of the redshift evolution of cosmic - ray generation rate , since cosmic - rays at this energy originate from distances shorter than several hundred mpc .",
    "the spectrum and flux at @xmath68  ev is mainly determined by the present ( @xmath56 ) generation rate and spectrum . the absolute flux measured at @xmath69",
    "ev differs between the various experiments , corresponding to a systematic @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) over - estimate of event energies in the agasa ( yakutsk ) experiment compared to the fly s eye experiment ( see also @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "1 , the yakutsk energy normalization is used .",
    "the suppression of model flux above @xmath3  ev is due to energy loss of high energy protons in interaction with the microwave background , i.e. to the `` gzk cutoff '' @xcite .",
    "both fly s eye and yakutsk data show a deficit in the number of events , compared to the number expected based on extrapolation of the @xmath67 power - law fit , consistent with the predicted suppression .",
    "the deficit is , however , only at a @xmath72 confidence level @xcite .",
    "the agasa data is consistent with fly s eye and yakutsk results below @xmath4  ev .",
    "a discrepancy may be emerging at higher energy , @xmath2  ev , where the fly s eye and yakutsk experiments detect 1 event each , and the agasa experiment detects 6 events for similar exposure .",
    "the flux above @xmath73 is dominated by sources at distances @xmath74 @xcite ( see  5 ) . since the distribution of known astrophysical systems ( e.g. galaxies , clusters of galaxies ) is inhomogeneous on scales of tens of mpc , significant deviations from model predictions presented in fig .",
    "1 for a uniform source distribution are expected above @xmath73 .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that clustering of cosmic - ray sources leads to a standard deviation , @xmath75 , in the expected number , @xmath76 , of events above @xmath4 ev , given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the unknown scale length of the source correlation function and @xmath79 mpc for field galaxies .",
    "an order of magnitude increase in the exposure of uhecr experiments , compared to that available at present , is required to test for the existence of the gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "such exposure would allow this test through an accurate determination of the spectrum in the energy range of @xmath3  ev to @xmath4  ev , where the effects of source inhomogeneities are expected to be small @xcite .",
    "moreover , an order of magnitude increase in exposure will also allow to determine the source correlation length @xmath78 , through the detection of anisotropies in the arrival directions of @xmath80  ev cosmic - rays over angular scales of @xmath81  mpc @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that preliminary results from the hires experiment were presented in this conference @xcite , reporting 7 events beyond @xmath4  ev for an exposure similar to that of the fly s eye .",
    "it is difficult to decide how to interpret this result , since the discrepancy between hires and fly s eye results is present not only above @xmath4  ev but also at lower energy , where fly s eye , agasa and yakutsk experiments are in agreement : 13 events above @xmath82  ev are reported in the preliminary hires analysis , while only 5 events at that energy range are reported by the fly s eye .",
    "we therefore believe that unambiguous conclusions based on the recent hires data can only be drawn after a complete analysis of the hires data is published .",
    "the energy of the most energetic cosmic ray detected by the fly s eye experiment is in excess of @xmath83 , and that of the most energetic agasa event is @xmath84 . on a cosmological scale ,",
    "the distance traveled by such energetic particles is small : @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) for the agasa ( fly s eye ) event ( e.g. , @xcite ) . thus , the detection of these events over a @xmath87 period can be reconciled with the rate of nearby grbs , @xmath24 per @xmath88 out to @xmath89 , only if there is a large dispersion , @xmath90 , in the arrival time of protons produced in a single burst .",
    "the required dispersion is likely to occur due to the combined effects of deflection by random magnetic fields and energy dispersion of the particles @xcite .",
    "a proton of energy @xmath91 propagating over a distance @xmath92 through a magnetic field of strength @xmath93 and correlation length @xmath94 is deflected by an angle @xmath95 , which results in a time delay , compared to propagation along a straight line , @xmath96 .",
    "the random energy loss uhecrs suffer as they propagate , owing to the production of pions , implies that at any distance from the observer there is some finite spread in the energies of uhecrs that are observed with a given fixed energy . for protons with energies",
    "@xmath11 the fractional rms energy spread is of order unity over propagation distances in the range @xmath97 ( e.g. @xcite ) . since the time delay is sensitive to the particle energy , this implies that the spread in arrival time of uhecrs with given observed energy is comparable to the average time delay at that energy , @xmath98 .",
    "the magnetic field required in order to produce a spread @xmath99  yr , is well below the current upper bound on the inter - galactic magnetic field , @xmath100 @xcite , which allows a spread @xmath101  yr .",
    "we discuss below some implications , unique to the grb model , of time delays induced by magnetic - field deflection .",
    "the rapid increase with energy of the pion production energy loss rate effectively introduces a cutoff distance , @xmath102 , beyond which sources do not contribute to the flux above @xmath91 .",

    "although @xmath103 depends through @xmath10 on the unknown properties of the intergalactic magnetic field , the rapid decrease of @xmath102 with energy near @xmath73 implies that @xmath103 is only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath106 . in the grb model ,",
    "the product @xmath107 is approximately limited to the range @xmath108 to @xmath109 ( the lower limit is set by the requirement that at least a few grb sources be present at @xmath110  mpc , and the upper limit by the faraday rotation bound @xmath100 @xcite and @xmath111 ) .",

    "the number of sources contributing to the flux is very large , and the overall uhecr flux received at any given time is near the average flux ( obtained for spatially and temporally homogeneous uhecr volume emissivity ) . at @xmath115",
    ", the flux will generally be much lower than the average , because there will be no burst within a distance @xmath102 having taken place sufficiently recently .",
    "there is , however , a significant probability to observe one source with a flux higher than the average .",
    "a source similar to the brightest one in fig .",
    "[ fignc ] appears @xmath116 of the time .    at any fixed time",
    "a given burst is observed in uhecrs only over a narrow range of energy , because if a burst is currently observed at some energy @xmath91 then uhecrs of much lower ( higher ) energy from this burst will arrive ( have arrived ) mainly in the future ( past ) . for energies above the pion production threshold , @xmath117 , the dispersion in arrival times of uhecrs with fixed observed",
    "energy is comparable to the average delay at that energy .",
    "this implies that the spectral width @xmath118 of the source at a given time is of order the average observed energy , @xmath119 .",
    "thus , bursting uhecr sources should have narrowly peaked energy spectra , and the brightest sources should be different at different energies . for steady state sources , on the other hand , the brightest source at high energies should also be the brightest one at low energies , its fractional contribution to the overall flux decreasing to low energy only as @xmath120 .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis of the time dependent energy spectrum of bursting sources is given in @xcite .",

    "detection of neutrinos from grbs could be used to test the simultaneity of neutrino and photon arrival to an accuracy of @xmath176 ( @xmath177 for short bursts ) , checking the assumption of special relativity that photons and neutrinos have the same limiting speed .",
    "these observations would also test the weak equivalence principle , according to which photons and neutrinos should suffer the same time delay as they pass through a gravitational potential . with @xmath178 accuracy ,",

    "<S> the @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) model for production of ultra - high - energy , @xmath1  ev , cosmic - rays is based on the hypothesis that grbs arise from the dissipation of the kinetic energy of relativistic fireballs at cosmological distances . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations of delayed low energy emission , `` afterglow , '' from grb sources strongly support the validity of this hypothesis . observations also provide quantitative support for the model . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred physical fireball parameters imply that protons may be accelerated to @xmath2  ev , and the inferred grb energy generation rate is similar to that required to account for the observed flux of ultra - high - energy cosmic - rays ( uhecrs ) </S>",
    "<S> .    strong suppression of cosmic - ray flux is expected in this model above @xmath3  ev , due to proton interaction with microwave background photons . </S>",
    "<S> strong deviations from model flux derived under the assumption of uniform source distribution is expected above @xmath4  ev , due to source discreteness and due to inhomogeneities in source distribution . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the flux above @xmath5  ev is expected to be dominated by few , narrow spectrum sources . while model predictions can not be tested ( with high confidence level ) using present data , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted signatures should be observed with the planned auger and telescope - array uhecr detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural consequence of the grb model of uhecr production is the conversion of a large fraction , @xmath6 , of the fireball energy to accompanying burst of @xmath7 and @xmath8 neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath9 neutrino detector would observe several tens of events per year correlated with grbs , and test for neutrino properties ( e.g. flavor oscillations , for which upward moving @xmath10 s would be a unique signature , and coupling to gravity ) with an accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currently possible . </S>"
