    "synchronization in chaotic systems is a surprising phenomenon , which recently received a lot of attention , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "even though the heuristic theory and the classification of the synchronization phenomena are well studied and reasonably well understood , a mathematically rigorous theory is still lacking . generally speaking",
    ", a standard difficulty lies in the fact that the phenomenon involves the dynamics of non - uniformly chaotic systems , typically consisting of different sub - systems , whose long - time behavior depends crucially on the sign of the `` central '' lyapunov exponents , i.e. of those exponents that are zero in the case of zero coupling , and become possibly non - trivial in the presence of interactions among the sub - systems .",
    "the mathematical control of such exponents is typically very hard .",
    "progress in their computation is a fundamental preliminary step for the construction of the srb measure of chains or lattices of chaotic flows , which may serve as toy models for extensive chaotic systems out - of - equilibrium ( i.e. they may serve as standard models for non - equilibrium steady states in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ) .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we introduced a simple model for phase synchronization in a three - dimensional system consisting of the suspension flow of arnold s cat map coupled with a clock .",
    "the coupling in @xcite was unidirectional , in the sense that it did not modify the suspension flow , but only the clock motion .",
    "notwithstanding its simplicity , the model has a non - trivial behavior : in particular , it exhibits phase locking and in @xcite we constructed the corresponding attractive invariant manifold via a convergent expansion .",
    "however , because of unidirectionality , the lyapunov spectrum in @xcite was very simple : the `` longitudinal '' exponents ( i.e. , those corresponding to the motion on the invariant manifold ) coincided with the unperturbed ones , and the central exponent was expressed in the form of a simple integral of the perturbation over the manifold . in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis of @xcite to a simple bidirectional model , for which the lyapunov spectrum is non - trivial , and we show how to compute it in terms of a modified expansion , which takes the form of a decorated tree expansion discussed in detail in the following .    the model is defined as follows",
    ". take arnold s cat map @xmath0 and denote by @xmath1 and @xmath2 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors , respectively , of @xmath3 : @xmath4 with @xmath5 , so that @xmath6 are normalized .",
    "we let the suspension flow of arnold s cat be defined as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , if @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "formally , @xmath11 is the solution to the following differential equation instead of , but throughout the paper we only used the fact that at all times @xmath12 the variable @xmath13 jumped abruptly from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , and besides these discontinuities the flow was smooth .",

    "therefore , the relative phase @xmath29 mod @xmath30 among the two flows is arbitrary .",
    "if @xmath31 and if the interaction is dissipative ( in a suitable sense , to be clarified in a moment ) , then the phases of the two sub - systems can lock , so that the limiting motion in the far future takes place on an attractor of dimension smaller than 3 , for all initial data in an open neighborood of the attractor . in @xcite , we explicitly constructed such an attractor in terms of a convergent power series expansion in @xmath32 , for @xmath33 and a special class of dissipative functions @xmath27 . in this paper , we generalize the analysis of @xcite to @xmath34 .",
    "our first result concerns the construction of the attractive invariant manifold for @xmath34 .",

    ", we show that the invariant manifold is holomorphic in @xmath32 in a suitable domain of the complex plane , whose boundary contains the origin .",
    "the construction also implies that @xmath54 is an attractor .",

    "in addition to the construction of the invariant surface , in this paper we show how to compute the invariant measure on the attractor and the lyapunov spectrum , in terms of convergent expansions .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath60 be the lesbegue measure restricted to @xmath56 , i.e. , denoting by @xmath61 the characteristic function of @xmath56 , @xmath62 , for all measurable @xmath63 .",

    "in particular , the central lyapunov exponent is negative : @xmath81 , while @xmath82 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "theorem [ prop:1 ] is proved in section [ sec:2 ] below .",
    "the proof follows the same strategy of @xcite : ( 1 ) we first write the equations for the invariant surface and solve them recursively at all orders in @xmath32 ; ( 2 ) then we express the result of the recursion ( which is not simply a power series in @xmath32 ) in terms of tree diagrams ( planar graphs without loops ) ; trees with @xmath83 nodes are proportional to @xmath84 times a _ tree value _ , which is also a function of @xmath32 ; ( 3 ) finally , using the tree representation , we derive an upper bound on the tree values . the fact that the dissipation is small , of order @xmath85 , produces bad factors @xmath86 in the bounds of the tree values , for some @xmath87 depending on the tree",
    "therefore , we need to show that for any tree @xmath87 is smaller than a fraction of @xmath83 , if @xmath83 is the number of nodes in the tree . this is proved by exhibiting suitable cancellations , arising from the condition @xmath39 .",
    "theorem [ prop:2 ] is proved in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the proof adapts the tree expansion to the computation of the local lyapunov exponents @xmath88 on the invariant surface , in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) and @xcite .",
    "the positive local lyapunov exponent @xmath89 plays the role of the gibbs potential for the invariant measure @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , given a convergent expansion for @xmath89 , @xmath90 can be constructed by standard cluster expansion methods , as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath72 can be expressed as averages of the local exponents over the stationary distribution .    in section [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we present some numerical evidences for a fractal to non - fractal transition of the invariant manifold , and formulate some conjectures .",
    "in this section , we define the equations for the invariant manifold , by introducing a conjugation that maps the dynamics restricted to the attractor onto the unperturbed one .",

    "the approximation obtained by neglecting @xmath105 is the simplest one displaying dissipation . in principle",
