    "since the first discovery of quasicrystal in a rapidly - quenched al - mn alloy in 1980s @xcite , hundreds of metallic quasicrystals , whose building blocks are on the atomic scale , are found both in syntheses in the laboratory @xcite and in nature @xcite .",
    "more recently , a growing number of mesoscopic quasicrystalline orders are reported in soft - matter systems @xcite .",
    "these soft quasicrystals exhibit distinct properties from their solid - state counterparts .",
    "for example , dodecagonal or even higher order symmetry are possible in the soft - matter systems @xcite , while dodecagonal solid - state quasicrystals are rarely seen @xcite .",
    "hence , soft quasicrystals are thought to have essentially different source of stability .",
    "theoretical studies on the origin and stability of an order pattern , including periodic and quasiperiodic crystals , often involve minimizing a suitable free energy functional of the system , and comparing free energies of different candidate phases @xcite .",
    "therefore a systematic investigation of the stability of quasicrystals requires the availability of appropriate free energy functionals and accurate methods of evaluating free energies of quasicrystals .",
    "several microscopic models have been studied over the years to explore the formation of quasicrystals arising from pair potentials with more than one microscopic length scales . among them ,",
    "denton and lwen @xcite obtained stable colloidal quasicrystals within one - component system . on the other hand ,",
    "phenomenological models based on coarse - grained free energy functionals are widely applied and particularly useful to the study of the stability of soft quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "the earliest one can trace back to alexander and mctague @xcite .",
    "they showed the possibility of stabilizing icosahedral quasicrystal using a landau - type free energy functional with one order parameter .",
    "related works include bak @xcite , jari @xcite , kalugin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and gronlund and mermin @xcite .",
    "mermin and troian @xcite followed alexander and mctague s theory , but introduced a second order parameter to obtain stable icosahedral quasicrystal .",
    "swift and hohenberg @xcite added a positive - definite gradient term into the free energy functional to represent the effect of characteristic length scale . from the viewpoint of fourier space ,",
    "the gradient term is small only near the critical wave number @xmath0 , thus suppressing the growth of any instabilities with wave numbers away from this value .",
    "their model can be used to describe the supercritical instability transition from a homogeneous state to one - mode patterns .",
    "after that , mller @xcite used a set of two coupled partial differential equations ; the pattern of a primary field is stabilized by a secondary coupled field which provides an effective space - dependent forcing .",
    "two - dimensional quasicrystals , consisting of 8- and 12-fold orientational order have been obtained in their models .",
    "later , dotera @xcite extended mermin - troian model to abc star copolymer systems with incompressible condition ; several ordered two - dimensional phases were investigated , including quasicrystals with decagonal and dodecagonal symmetry and an archimedean tiling pattern named @xmath1 .    beyond the study of soft quasicrystals , lifshitz and petrich @xcite investigated quasicrystalline patterns arising in parametrically - excited surface waves .",
    "although motivated by different physical phenomena , the free energy functional of their model is in a similar form with those in the preceding landau - type models .",
    "they used only one order parameter describing the amplitude of the standing - wave pattern , yet an additional differential term characterizing multiple - frequency forcing in the free energy functional .",
    "they successfully stabilized dodecagonal quasicrystalline pattern by introducing multiple - frequency forcing and three - body interactions .",
    "although the forementioned theoretical studies focus on different physical issues , they reveal the same physical nature in the formation of quasicrystals .",
    "( i ) they may arise from the competition of multiple length scales @xcite .",
    "( ii ) at the same time the three - body interactions characterized by the cubic terms play an important role in stabilizing soft quasicrystals @xcite . therefore constructing an appropriate free energy functional to study",
    "the stability of quasicrystals should consist of more than one length scale and three - body interactions at least .",
    "it is also noticed that the soft quasicrystals are usually discovered in relatively complicated multicomponent soft - matter systems , such as in abc star - shaped terpolymers @xcite , abac tetrablock copolymers @xcite .",
    "therefore a free energy functional with multiple coupled fields may be appropriate to study these complex soft - matter systems . in this work ,",
    "we will make full use of those underlying physical nature of quasicrystals in the literature and extend the swift - hohenberg model to study the stability of soft quasicrystals .",
    "the extension is twofold : one is a positive - definite gradient terms with multi - mode interaction to describe competing length scales ; the other one is that we introduce multiple order parameters which would be available to study the generic multicomponent systems .    besides a proper free energy functional , the study of thermodynamic stability requires accurate evaluation of free energy of various ordered phases .",
    "a number of methods have been developed to calculate energy of quasicrystalline pattens , including two - mode approximation approach @xcite , using periodic structures to approximate quasicrystals with large unit cells @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to calculate the free energy of quasicrystals is based on the observation that quasiperiodic lattices can be generated by a cut - and - project method from higher - dimensional periodic lattices@xcite .",
    "it follows that the density and free energy of quasicrystals can be obtained using the quasiperiodic lattices derived from the higher - dimensional periodic structure .",
    "a approach along this line is the gaussian method , in which the density profile of a quasicrystal is assumed to be given by a sum of gaussian functions centered at the lattice points of a predetermined quasicrystalline lattice@xcite .",
    "the width of the gaussian function is treated as a variational parameter , which is optimized to minimize the free energy of the system .",
    "more recently , jiang and zhang @xcite proposed the projection method which embeds the fourier space of quasicrystal into a higher - dimensional periodic structure , so that the quasiperiodic pattern can be recovered by projecting the higher - dimensional reciprocal lattice vectors back to the original fourier space through a projection matrix .",
    "as a special case , it can also be used to investigate periodic crystals by setting the projection matrix as an identity matrix . from this perspective",
    "the projection method provides a unified computational framework for the study of periodic crystals and quasicrystals . in this work",
    ", we will continue to develop the projection method by optimizing the shape and size of higher - dimensional periodic cell which is important to explore potential metastable ordered patterns and evaluate the free energy with higher accuracy .",
    "the organization of the rest of article is as follows . in section",
    "[ section : model ] , the coupled - mode swift - hohenberg model with two coupled fields is presented .",
    "we will see that no forementioned artificial assumption is needed in its analysis with the extension . in section",
    "[ section : methods ] , we will discuss a two - mode approximation approach and a computational framework to analyze the proposed model .",
    "the former mainly focus on the behavior of the model in the limiting regime , when strong constraints are imposed to the wave numbers ; the latter concerns the general case .",
    "our numerical method is based on the projection method @xcite , combined with a variable cell method optimizing higher - dimensional periodic cells in order to deal with potentially quasicrystalline patterns and other complex phases . in section [ section : results ] , phase diagrams for stable decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals in the coupled - mode swift - hohenberg model will be exhibited .",
    "we will also emphasize the important roles of the ratio of characteristic length scales in pattern formation .",
    "section [ section : conclusion ] will be devoted to conclusion and a brief discussion .",
    "we will remark that , the numerical framework we develop here can well apply to a large class of more sophisticated models for soft quasicrystals , for example , those employing convolution - type kernels of pairwise correlations @xcite . and",
    "our study of the coupled - mode swift - hohenberg model essentially promotes understanding in more general soft - matter cases .",
    "we consider the stability of soft quasicrystals in three - component systems , such as abc star - shaped terpolymers @xcite , abac tetrablock copolymers @xcite , in the landau theoretical framework .",
    "quantities of interest are effective densities of each component , defined by the deviation of spatial densities of monomers from their corresponding averages .",
    "we denote the effective densities of components a , b , and c by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . by assuming local incompressibility , @xmath5 ,",
    "the free energy of the three - component system can be expressed in terms of two order parameters @xcite , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which should appear in the landau - type free energy functionals .",
    "then we construct the minimal model to stabilize the periodic and quasiperiodic patterns .",
    "followed by the work of alexander and mctague @xcite , mller @xcite , and dotera @xcite , the nonlinear term in the free energy functional containing two- , three- , and four - body interactions is written as @xmath8 = \\frac{1}{v}\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,[\\tau\\psi^2 + g_0\\psi^3+\\psi^4+t\\phi^2+t_0\\phi^3+\\phi^4-g_1\\psi^2\\phi - g_2\\psi\\phi^2 ] .",

    ", the third - order terms play an important role in stabilizing periodic and quasiperiodic crystals , because the cubic term is associated with triad interactions among wave modes . according to dotera ,",
    "when the component of c dominates the disorder - order transition , the term @xmath15 in can be neglected @xcite , i.e.  we set @xmath16 .",
    "the quartic terms are responsible for providing a lower bound for the free energy .",
    "since only the minimal model is constructed to study ordered patterns of interest , for simplicity , the quartic cross terms are omitted .    as is mentioned in the preceding section , the formation of quasicrystals results from multiple characteristic length scales . in order to introduce multiple frequency forcing , inspired by the original work of swift and hohenberg @xcite , later by mller @xcite , and lifshitz and petrich @xcite , we add two positive - definite gradient terms into the free energy functional , acting on two order parameters respectively , @xmath17=\\frac{1}{v}\\big\\{\\frac{c}{2}\\int & \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,\\left[(\\nabla^2 + 1)\\psi\\right]^2+\\left[(\\nabla^2+q^2)\\phi\\right]^2 \\\\ & + \\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,(\\tau\\psi^2+g_0\\psi^3+\\psi^4+t\\phi^2+t_0\\phi^3 + \\phi^4-g_1\\psi^2\\phi - g_2\\psi\\phi^2 ) \\big\\}. \\end{aligned } \\label{equation : modified_model}\\ ] ] they act as soft constraints on the magnitude of wave vectors , or the wave numbers , of the order parameters , with @xmath18 indicating their intensity .",
    "two critical wave numbers are preferred , @xmath0 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the fourier modes with wave numbers away from them will increase the free energy in the differential terms and thus are suppressed . indeed ,",
    "if we formally apply parseval s identity , we find that @xmath21 ^ 2+\\left[(\\nabla^2+q^2)\\phi\\right]^2=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^d}\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}\\,(-|\\mathbf{k}|^2 + 1)^2|\\hat\\psi(\\mathbf{k})|^2 + ( -|\\mathbf{k}|^2+q^2)^2|\\hat\\phi(\\mathbf{k})|^2 , \\label{equation : apply parseval 's identity to the modified model}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) is the fourier transform of @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) and @xmath26 is the spatial dimension .",
    "the expression is similar in the case when @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be characterized by fourier series instead of fourier transform , simply obtained by replacing the integrations by summations . as a result , in order to obtain lower energy , the fourier wave vectors of @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) tend to be close to the circle with radius 1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) in the fourier space . if @xmath27 , @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) should be strictly supported on the circle with radius 1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) .",
    "this recovers the forementioned assumption that the wave vectors corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 should favor a single magnitude in much literature @xcite , and makes this model numerically computable .",
    "it should be noted that , there might be only one principal wave number for periodic structures , which implies that one of the order parameters is degenerate . for quasicrystals that are a class of multimode patterns and",
    "have multiple principal wave numbers , both of the critical wave numbers should be occupied @xcite .",
    "it is helpful to study the phase behavior of the coupled - mode swift - hohenberg model under the limit @xmath27 .",
    "as is noted above , the analysis performed for various landau - type models in much literature is essentially of this type @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we need this type of asymptotic results to compare with those obtained under finite @xmath28 s .",
    "hence we discuss the two - mode approximation approach briefly .    for @xmath29 , the wave numbers of order parameter @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) should be strictly equal to @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) . we can formally expand them as @xmath31 @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) is the set of spectrum points of @xmath24 ( resp .",

    "since @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real - valued functions , the coefficients should satisfy @xmath40 and @xmath41 . substituting ( [ equation : spectrum representation of order parameters ] ) into ( [ equation : modified_model ] ) , we immediately get the energy functional as a function of @xmath38 s and @xmath42 s .",
    "based on the choice of @xmath19 and the rotational symmetry of interest , we will a priori select several candidates by determining @xmath32 and @xmath33 as in @xcite .",
    "they will be specified below right before each numerical simulation . for simplicity",
    ", we also choose @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath44 ) to be identical for all @xmath34 ( resp .",
    ". then we use the common optimization method , e.g. ,  the steepest descent method , to minimize the free energy @xmath45 with respect to @xmath38 s and @xmath42 s for each candidate .",
    "note that @xmath38 s and @xmath42 s are complex numbers , which implies we should not only optimize the amplitude of plane waves , but also their phase angles . finally , we choose the configuration with the lowest energy as the ground state .",
    "repeat the above procedure for all the parameter points of interest , we will obtain the phase diagram in the limit @xmath27 .      in order to study the coupled - mode swift - hohenberg model for general @xmath28 s , we propose the following numerical method to directly minimize the free energy functional ( [ equation : modified_model ] ) .",
    "we basically employ the steepest descent method in the minimization : introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath9 and solve the following relaxation equations from some initial configurations @xmath46 and @xmath47 until the equilibrium is reached . @xmath48 these equations are solved in a pseudo - spectral approach .",
    "take fourier transform on both sides and we find @xmath49 the differential terms can be easily evaluated by pointwise multiplication in the fourier space , while for the polynomial terms , we first perform inverse fourier transform to obtain @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ". then we compute them in the real space and perform fourier transform to get the desired form in the fourier space .",
    "we note that the pseudo - spectral method is suitable for this problem because all the periodic and quasiperiodic orders @xmath24 and @xmath25 will have discrete fourier spectrum . on the other hand",
    ", it requires careful discretization of the fourier space so that all the spectrum points can be well captured .",
    "the periodic orders are discretized in an ordinary way since their spectrum points locate on a periodic lattice in the fourier space . to deal with the potentially quasiperiodic states , we employ the projection method @xcite . for 2-dimensional quasicrystals ,",
    "more than two basis vectors are used in the fourier space to represent the discrete spectrum of quasicrystalline patterns . to be more precise",
    ", we need @xmath50 basis vectors in @xmath51 that are linearly independent in the field of rational number @xmath52 , namely , @xmath53 .",
    "then all the discretization points in the fourier space are encoded as @xmath54 the linear independence guarantees that different @xmath55 s will give different @xmath39 s .",
    "the choice of @xmath56 and @xmath57 closely relies on the orders of interest , especially their symmetry .",
    "in particular , @xmath58 for decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals .",
    "the basis vectors are initially chosen as @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( resp .",
    "@xmath61 ) in the decagonal ( resp .  dodecagonal ) case .",
    "we will discuss the approach of optimizing computational cell , or equivalently adjusting basis vectors later . then all the computations will well resemble those in computing a periodic order using spectral method in @xmath56-dimensional space .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite for more discussions on technical details .",
    "we only note that the computational cost is considerably large in such higher - dimensional computations .",
    "for example , for decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals , we use @xmath62 spectrum points , where @xmath63 is the number of discretization points on each dimension given in ( [ equation : discretization point in projection method ] ) .",
    "hence the cost in each step of iteration in the steepest descent method grows as @xmath64 since we heavily use fft .",
    "it follows that equations becomes a group of odes for the fourier coefficients on the given spectrum points . due to numerical stiffness ,",
    "semi - implicit scheme is employed in the iteration to avoid extremely small time step . for simplicity",
    ", we use fixed time step .",
    "initial value of the iteration is given by approximants of potential ground states , such as some quasicrystalline orders of interest or some periodic orders whose fourier spectrum consists of plane waves with magnitude @xmath30 and @xmath19 only .",
    "we will specify these initial values later right before each numerical experiment .    as is discussed above",
    ", we choose the basis @xmath57 ( and thus all the spectrum points of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) in the numerical method .",
    "however , it is often difficult to determine a priori where the spectrum of the ground state should locate .",
    "the choice of basis becomes an artificial restriction in the computations .",
    "hence , we are going to improve the minimization method with a strategy of optimizing the computational domain , which is named variable cell method .",
    "along with ( [ equation : steepest descent method in fourier space ] ) , we also apply the steepest descent method to optimize the basis vectors , i.e. , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a positive constant determined empirically to make the evolution numerically stable and efficient .",
    "explicit scheme and fixed time step are employed .",
    "since @xmath45 is originally not a function of the basis vectors @xmath57 s , we note that they actually come into the differential term of the free energy functional . to see this",
    ", we can expand @xmath24 and @xmath25 as in ( [ equation : spectrum representation of order parameters ] ) .",
    "then the free energy becomes @xmath67 = c'\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}\\left[(-|\\mathbf{k}|^2 + 1)^2|\\hat\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 + ( -|\\mathbf{k}|^2+q^2)^2|\\hat\\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2\\right]+g(\\hat\\psi,\\hat\\phi ) , \\label{equation : express f as a function of basis}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a positive number depending on @xmath28 and the constant coming out from the integral .",
    "@xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) is a long vector whose components are all @xmath69 s ( resp .",
    "@xmath70 s ) .",
    "@xmath71 is the energy contributed by the polynomial terms in ( [ equation : modified_model ] ) , which does not depend on the position of fourier spectral points ( and thus the basis vectors ) but only their coefficients .",
    "one then expands @xmath39 in the above formula by using .",
    "it is easy to see that the free energy becomes a function of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath57 s .",
    "hence , is well - defined .",
    "there is still a special constraint in optimizing basis vectors in the quasiperiodic orders , when the number of basis vectors is larger than the dimension of the fourier space : the basis vectors should be linearly independent in the field of rational numbers @xmath52 . otherwise , the expression of the energy contributed by the polynomial terms ( the second term in ) will be changed .",
    "once the basis vectors start to evolve with ( [ equation : steepest descent method in fourier space for basis ] ) , it is difficult to preserve or check this property .",
    "however , a weaker condition is helpful : the basis vectors should not be parallel with each other .",
    "this condition can be violated in the numerical sense .",
    "for example , when one starts minimization with a quasiperiodic configuration using four basis vectors under some parameters , where a two - dimensional periodic order is the actual ground state , the four basis vectors may tend to  mimic \" the spectrum of the two - dimensional periodic order .",
    "some basis vectors will thus become almost parallel to each other and the problem becomes ill - conditioned . to formulate this criterion",
    ", we let @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and require that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a small positive number whose typical value is chosen as @xmath76 . in every step of steepest descent iteration",
    ", we will check if ( [ equation : condition for well - posed basis vectors ] ) is satisfied . if not , the optimization has to be terminated . in computing periodic orders where the number of basis vectors is equal to the dimension of the fourier space , the same criterion may also apply although it is not necessary .",
    "based on the discussions above , we conclude the direct minimization algorithm by sketching the numerical recipes    step 1 : :    given parameters @xmath28 , @xmath19 , @xmath9 ,    @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 ,    @xmath13 and @xmath14 , choose the basis vectors and    the initial configurations of @xmath24 and    @xmath25 .",
    "step 2 : :    freeze the basis vectors and minimize ( [ equation : modified_model ] )    with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 by    ( [ equation : steepest descent method in fourier space ] ) .",
    "the iteration    is terminated when the right - hand side of ( [ equation : steepest descent    method in fourier space ] ) is sufficiently small .",
    "step 3 : :    minimize ( [ equation : modified_model ] ) with respect to    @xmath24 , @xmath25 and basis vectors    simultaneously by ( [ equation : steepest descent method in fourier    space ] ) and ( [ equation : steepest descent method in fourier space for    basis ] ) . condition ( [ equation : condition for well - posed basis    vectors ] ) is checked after each step of iteration .",
    "the minimization is    terminated when the right - hand sides of ( [ equation : steepest descent    method in fourier space ] ) and ( [ equation : steepest descent method in    fourier space for basis ] ) are both sufficiently small , which is a good    ending , or when ( [ equation : condition for well - posed basis vectors ] )    is violated , which is a bad ending . in the latter case",
    ", a new initial    configuration has to be chosen .",
    "step 4 : :    repeat the above process with various initial configurations and find    out the ground state with the lowest free energy .    by repeating the above steps with different choice of parameters , we can obtain phase diagrams of interest .",
    "we also remark that step 2 helps improve the efficiency of the algorithm , since the initial guess of basis vectors can be far away from the final configuration , which may lead to long iterations if we optimize order parameters and basis vectors simultaneously from the beginning .    in principle , the developed numerical methods can be applied to compute two- and three - dimensional quasiperiodic patterns .",
    "the dimension @xmath56 of computational space in the projection method depends on the symmetries of considered quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "for example , for three - dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals , the projection method should be performed in six - dimensional space , which results in huge computational cost .",
    "hence , we restrict the current study to two - dimensional quasiperiodic patterns whose point group symmetries can be embedded into four - dimensional periodic lattice , such as quasicrystalline orders with 10- or 12-fold symmetry .",

    "it enables accurate calculations of the free energy of ordered patterns , leading to phase diagrams with more accurate phase boundaries .",
    "moreover , it shows the potential to discover more complex phases , such as incommensurate modulation structures .",
    "the generalized model as well as the numerical framework provide a powerful tool for investigating the phase behavior of ordered patterns on the mean - field level .    employing this tool , we study the phase behavior of the coupled - mode model under the soft constraints on wave numbers ( i.e.  @xmath97 ) , and compare it with that in the limiting case @xmath27 ( i.e.  infinitely stiff constraints ) , which is obtained by the two - mode approximation method .",

    "in particular , we remark that the classic two - mode approximation analysis a priori assumes the order parameters favor specific length scales @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and is not sufficient to capture the true phase behavior of models of this type .    furthermore , the role of the ratio of two characteristic length - scales , @xmath19 , on the pattern formation is also studied . a one - dimensional phase diagram as a function of @xmath19 with other system parameters fixed",

    "it should be emphasized that when varying the value of @xmath19 , the variable cell method plays an important role of accurately calculate the free energy .",
    "these results provide a good understanding of the rich phase behavior on the mean - field level in the coupled - mode swift - hohenberg model for three - component systems .",
    "it confirms that the existence of two characteristic length scales and sufficiently strong three - body interactions can account for the stability of soft quasicrystals @xcite . in the current work ,",
    "the 10- , 12-fold symmetric quasicrystals , and some modulated structures can become stable phases . to this date , in the most experiments of soft matters , quasicrystals have been observed in dodecagonal symmetry , whereas decagonal quasicrystal have not been reported . however , it is still worth expecting the decagonal symmetric quasicrystals , and even modulated structures in the multi - component soft - matter systems .",
    "the numerical framework we developed , combining the projection method with the variable cell method , is suitable for studying periodic and quasiperiodic orders in the current model .",
    "it also works for a larger class of mean - field energy functionals .",
    "for example , if the differential terms in ( [ equation : modified_model ] ) are replaced by convolution - type interaction kernels @xcite @xmath125=\\frac{1}{v}&\\left[\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}_1\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}_2\\,\\psi(\\mathbf{r}_1)c_1(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi(\\mathbf{r}_2 ) + \\phi(\\mathbf{r}_1)c_2(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right.\\\\ & \\left.+\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,\\tau\\psi^2+g_0\\psi^3+\\psi^4+t\\phi^2+\\phi^4-g_1\\psi^2\\phi - g_2\\psi\\phi^2\\right ] , \\end{split } \\label{equation : convolution - type_models}\\ ] ] our method works as well .",
    "indeed , by parseval s identity , the convolution can be rewritten as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a constant coming out from the fourier transform .",
    "it is essentially in the same form as ( [ equation : apply parseval s identity to the modified model ] ) , which can be dealt with in exactly the same way .",
    "a potential drawback of our numerical method is that , although it allows to perform minimization with larger degrees of freedom , it is not of high accuracy , especially when @xmath28 and @xmath63 are small .",
    "it is well - known that the ordinary spectral method enjoys spectral accuracy in dealing with periodic problems in general , but it might be not the case in our quasiperiodic settings .",
    "the part of energy , for which the wave vectors in ( [ equation : discretization point in projection method ] ) do not account , decreases slowly as @xmath63 grows .",
    "in other words , there is still a considerable amount of energy contributed by the wave vectors with high indices , which are not necessarily of high frequencies . in the current work , we set @xmath100 and use @xmath128 bases in the direction of each basis vector",
    ". it is sufficient to obtain energy of the ground states with four- to five - digit precision and thus can be used in constructing the phase diagrams .",
    "however , when @xmath28 is smaller , we need larger @xmath63 , which is not always affordable for four- or higher - dimensional computations in the projection method .",
    "recall that the computational cost in one step of steepest descent iteration grows as @xmath64 in computing decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals .",
    "the problem of low accuracy can be model - specific , since it does not occur in our earlier work on the lifshitz - petrich model @xcite .",
    "in fact , the penalizing effect of the differential terms in the lifshitz - petrich model is much stronger than that in ( [ equation : modified_model ] ) .",
    "the former one is proportional to @xmath129 as @xmath130 , while the latter one grows as @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that the fourier wave numbers far away from the prescribed length scales ( i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath19 ) are suppressed more strongly in the lifshitz - petrich model than in the current model . as a result",
    ", their contribution to the energy becomes less significant in the lifshitz - petrich model .",
