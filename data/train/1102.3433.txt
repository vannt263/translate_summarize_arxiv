    "the physics driving the evolution from the collapse of gas and dark matter halos to the formation of galaxies remains one of the open questions in astrophysics . in general , star formation efficiency  viewed as the stellar to total mass fraction within the virial radius of a halo  is highest for galaxies similar to the milky way , with an efficiency decreasing towards higher and lower masses @xcite .",
    "the lower escape velocities in less massive galaxies allow the gas to be ejected by stellar feedback @xcite .",
    "supernova - induced winds are energetic enough to significantly impede galaxy formation at baryonic masses below @xmath13m@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "such feedback regulates the star formation efficiency , which is responsible for the mass - metallicity relation @xcite . for more massive galaxies , an active galactic nucleus ( agn )",
    "is believed to account for the decreasing efficiency ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this feedback mechanism explains the exponential cut - off in the luminosity function , either by the thermal coupling of agn outflows with gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by mechanical feedback that prevents gas cooling @xcite .",
    "observational estimates of the stellar baryon fraction are thus an essential piece of the puzzle and provide important constraints on simulations , especially at the sub - grid level that describes the baryon physics of galaxy formation .",
    "they also help to understand the nature of the scaling relations , such as the fundamental plane and its projections .",
    "currently , most of the studies that resolve the central regions of galaxies on scales below 10  kpc are based on dynamical models applied to the kinematics of stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , lensing studies on galaxy scales are usually based on a parametric decomposition of the stellar and dark matter component ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with its inherent degeneracies . over larger scales , @xcite and",
    "@xcite match the stellar mass function of sdss galaxies with the distribution of dark matter halos from numerical simulations to find stellar baryon fractions @xmath15%  significantly lower than the cosmological fraction @xmath16 @xcite  with a maximum for galaxies with halo masses around @xmath17m@xmath14 .",
    "however , this approach is only valid for masses enclosed within the virial radius , and can not resolve the radial dependence , which offers valuable information about how baryons build galaxies .",
    "for instance , the velocity dispersion analysis of @xcite on a sample of sdss early - type galaxies gives within the effective radius a low baryon fraction ( @xmath18% ) which is lower than the cosmological value , but twice as large as determined within the virial radius , illustrating the importance of a resolved estimate of the baryon fraction within galaxy halos .",
    "galaxy formation models combining the evolution of the dark matter and gaseous components along with a set of sub - grid prescriptions for star formation and feedback ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are only indirect methods with considerable uncertainties . indeed , robust observational estimates of the baryon fraction on galaxy scales are needed to properly constrain the recipes included in these models .",
    "+ gravitational lensing opens a door to smaller scales over which baryonic processes are important .",
    "for instance , one can explore concentrations and baryon fractions giving good evidence of adiabatic contraction , as done e.g. by @xcite .",
    "they analyze the relation between stellar baryon fraction and concentration in adiabatic and non - adiabatic models .",
    "@xcite present a galaxy - galaxy weak lensing analysis of a large sample of early and late - type galaxies .",
    "they obtain stellar surface masses depending on radius with a resolution down to 10  kpc .",
    "however , their approach is also based on a halo - model to describe the relation of galaxies and dark matter .",
    "+ the use of mass models and model - based prescriptions introduces hard - to - quantify deviations from real mass distributions , especially over the scales of a few r@xmath19 that we want to investigate . assuming a mass model for a lensing system excludes mass distributions which are not accessible in the parameter - space of the model and introduces the problem of model non - uniqueness . to avoid this , free - form methods are necessary . in this paper , we use the _ pixelens _ method of @xcite to reconstruct the surface mass density of a sample of lens galaxies .",
    "for the stellar component  which represents the vast majority of the baryons in the inner regions of early - type galaxies  the photometric data is used to constrain a large volume of stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models @xcite . the combination of both lensing and stellar mass in a pixel - based manner allows for a two - dimensional mapping of the baryon fraction .",
    "choosing a sample of moderate redshift lenses enables us to determine the lensing profile out to a few r@xmath19 .",
    "the castles sample fulfills this requirement .",
    "we present in this paper an analysis of the enclosed stellar and total mass content in a sample of 21 lensing galaxies out to a radial distance of @xmath20 times the einstein radius , i.e. up to several @xmath21 .",
    "+ in section [ sec : sample ] we discuss briefly the lens sample with respect to environment , lens morphology and photometric properties . by means of three lens systems , arguably rather extreme , we illustrate the subtleties of photometric modeling and the authenticity of lenses .",
    "the latter point refers to unlensed double quasars which mimic a lens system with a doubly imaged quasar .",
    "we will show how a real lens can be distinguished from a spurious system in our analysis .",
    "we test the reliablility of our photometry - based results by comparing inferred stellar surface mass densities with equivalent results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section [ sec3 ] presents the results of this study regarding the radial dependence of enclosed stellar versus total lens mass .",
    "we continue in section [ sec : cse ] with a closer examination of the stellar and total mass concentration and define a simple model to study the energetic evolution of early type galaxies .",
    "the conclusion and discussion section [ sec5 ] summarizes our findings and puts them into the context of recent work on galaxy formation .",
    "in the following we compare lens samples in general with respect to their environment . we also explain how the environment affects the lens systems and continue with a detailed one - by - one study of the lenses used in this analysis according to their photometric and morphological properties . to get a clear view on lens galaxies",
    "whose baryonic content we want to determine , we need to correct the data for light originating from the quasar images , by means of psf subtraction and masking .",
    "the selection criteria for our lens sample are as follows . for the lens mass reconstruction we must have the redshifts of the source and the lens as well as accurate image positions .",
    "the stellar population synthesis analysis demands a sufficient separation between lens and quasar images in order to extract uncontaminated photometric estimates from the lens .",
    "furthermore , nir imaging must be available .",
    "constraining the sps models using photometry in several bands is desirable , although we note that our reference h - band is the f160w filter of hst / nicmos . for the redshift of most of the lenses ,",
    "this band maps a rest - frame region that does not change significantly for the colours found in these galaxies .",
    "we discuss in this section the available multiband data and respective psfs used for the modeling of the surface brightness distribution .",
    "finally we discuss outliers and special cases for comparison . all information regarding lens galaxy properties ,",
    "their environment and photometry is given in table [ tab1 ] and table [ tab2 ] .",
    "to describe a lens with respect to its environment , one has to keep in mind that the lens shear required by ( parametric and non - parametric ) lens models can be due to physically interacting galaxies or to line - of - sight objects . regarding the former",
    ", one could estimate how the environment of the lens galaxy evolved in its recent past , whereas any line - of - sight objects are naturally unrelated to the local region of the lens .",
    "nevertheless these two sources for shear are hard to distinguish .",
    "if located in a group or cluster environment , x - ray measurements are expected to give reliable constraints on the dm content @xcite and thus a hint about the direction and strength of the shear .",
    "only a few lens environments have been studied so far for castles lenses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+ the environment for a sample of 70 slacs lenses has been studied by @xcite ; they find @xmath22 are in overdense regions .",
    "for our sample of 21 castles lenses we find that 7 galaxies are located in groups and 3 in clusters .",
    "four galaxies have one close galaxy or possible companion with which they may interact gravitationally . for the remaining 7 ,",
    "no large shear contribution is required and no close galaxies have been found .",
    "thus we find that @xmath23 of our galaxies lie in overdense regions .",
    "the lower fraction found by @xcite is likely due to the smaller redshift range of slacs ( up to @xmath24 ) and the property of the sdss selection function to pick lenses whose einstein radius is about the fibre - radius of the sdss spectrograph ( 3  arcsec ) .      in the following",
    "we briefly discuss the lens sample .",
    "in addition to the previous paragraph we provide information about the environment which in fact influences both the mass model and the light profile and yields important insights into the evolution of early - type galaxies . after giving the full name of the lenses we use their abbreviations only . the method",
    "used to model the lenses is explained in detail in section [ sec : lens ] .",
    "figure [ fig16 ] shows the appearance of the free - form mass models . + for 9 lensing systems all three bands were used to constrain a large number of sps models , which consequently sets constraints on the colour - to - mass relation .",
    "another 8 lenses could be analysed in h and i band .",
    "the remaining 4 lenses had suitable data in h band only .",
    "+ first , we describe the 9 lenses with suitable data in all three wavebands .",
    "the four - image lens system ( `` quad '' ) * b0712 + 472 * is one of the few lenses for which a _ tinytim _ psf was sufficient to remove quasar images in h band .",
    "in v and i band the quasar images could all be masked out .",
    "lens models found in previous studies require significant external shear , which can be attributed to 9 or more galaxies in a foreground group at @xmath25 found by @xcite .",
    "their study also shows one other galaxy at the redshift of b0712 at @xmath26 from the lens .",
    "the quads * b1422 + 231 * , * b2045 + 265 * , * q0047 - 2808 * , * q2237 + 030 * undergo the following treatment . in both i and v bands , _ tinytim _ provided a suitable psf . in the h band",
    "an isolated star taken from the same or a contemporaneous nicmos image was used for convolution and point - source fitting if needed .",
    "b1422 is in a poor group with 5 nearby galaxies mostly south east of the lens that cause a significant shear @xcite .",
    "the group is visible in x - rays at @xmath27 kev @xcite . in recent work by @xcite 12 new members were found to be part of the group . b2045 as found by @xcite might be influenced by a group of galaxies west of the lens .",
    "a shear in this direction is also required by the lens model .",
    "the lens might also be affected by a close dwarf galaxy causing anomalous flux ratios @xcite .",
    "q0047 is a lens with only a small shear required by lens models .",
    "however , @xcite find evidence for a galaxy group with 9 members . in the case of the einstein",
    "cross q2237 the bulge of a spiral galaxy is responsible for the lensing .",
    "the system shows only a mild external shear due to the disk of the spiral galaxy .    for spiral galaxies",
    "the contribution of dust to the photometry is usually more significant than for early - type galaxies ( the latter morphological type constitute the majority of our lensing galaxies ) .",
    "however , we note that in the case of q2237 , the redshift of the lens is very low , which implies that our reference photometric band ( h ) maps a similar wavelength range in the _ rest frame _ , where dust attenuation is less severe . from the estimates of @xcite on vlt / fors1 spectra of q2237",
    ", we infer a contribution from dust in the h band photometry of q2237 at the level of 0.05 mag @xcite .    for lenses * bri0952 - 0115 * , * q0142 - 100 * and * pg1115 + 080 * extensive use of the iteration method described in section [ sec2.1 ] was made if the quasar images could not be masked out .",
    "the environments of the doubly imaged quasars bri0952 and q0142 have been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and found to have no dominant impact on the total shear beyond a cosmological ( large - scale structure ) contribution @xmath28 which is additionally confirmed by lens models .",
    "bri0952 was previously thought to reside in a region loosely bound to a poor group with 5 members @xcite ; a later study found it is at higher redshift and thus not connected with the group @xcite .",
    "for q0142 there is not much known about the close - in group environment , although there are some galaxies near the line - of - sight , whose redshifts are mostly unknown .",
    "@xcite speculate that a galaxy about @xmath29 away from the lens may be a group member .",
    "the environment of the quad pg1115 is thoroughly analyzed by @xcite .",
    "they find 13 galaxies in a local group with elongated group emission in x - rays according to @xcite .",
    "the brightest 4 members of the group are located on an axis with a position angle of @xmath30 ( measured north through east ) of the lens mass which accounts well for the shear required in our lens model .",
    "the two - image lens * hs0818 + 1227 * requires special treatment as we use an isolated psf of image b1030 + 071 to fit the quasar image in the h band . in the i and v bands ,",
    "the quasar images are used for fitting .",
    "iteration as it is used for enhancing psfs of other lenses does not provide better model fits for the lens because of the large separation between images and lens .",
    "the image separation is @xmath31 .",
    "hence the reduction process is further simplified by masking . since its discovery by @xcite",
    "no further insights into the environmental properties of the lens are available .",
    "nevertheless @xcite found a galaxy @xmath32 north of the lens which appears to have the same redshift of @xmath33 , which explains the external shear required by our lens model .",
    "a chain of galaxies at a distance of @xmath29 north - east could also be associated with the lens galaxy .",
    "+ next , we describe the 8 lenses with suitable data in two wavebands .    for the quad * b1608 + 656 * and",
    "the doubles * he1104 - 1805 * and * he2149 - 2745 * h and i band data could be used to isolate the lens galaxy . according to @xcite *",
    "mg2016 + 112 * exhibits quadruply imaged features of the quasar jet which can be distinguished only in the radio band .",
    "we take account of the rather complex structure in the lensing part of our analysis . for all their h band images ,",
    "a sufficiently isolated star with fitted background extracted from the image of mg0414 + 0534 was used to remove the quasar images with an acceptable goodness of fit .",
    "b1608 resides in the middle of a galaxy group with 8 other group members according to @xcite .",
    "the photometry shows an object close to the main galaxy , which constitutes a second lens galaxy .",
    "this is confirmed by the reconstructed mass map ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) as it predicts a conspicuously elongated mass distribution towards ne .",
    "images also show a prominent dust lane between the two galaxies .",
    "however , we analyzed the impact of dust reddening on our results , as shown in appendix [ appa ] for b1608 and b1600 .",
    "the uncertainty due to dust on @xmath34 is in both cases not larger than 0.3 dex .",
    "mg2016 is known to be a giant elliptical galaxy in a cluster with 69 probable photometrically selected members of many different galaxy types @xcite . among them is a significant fraction of merging cluster galaxies , which is direct evidence for a hierarchical formation history @xcite .",
    "most of the neighbouring objects within @xmath35 lie on an east - west axis and thus explain the major shear direction .",
    "he1104 features the second highest image separation of @xmath36 and a distinct lens galaxy ( the median separation is @xmath37 ) .",
    "furthermore the lens appears to be near the bright image which is rather unusual and implies the presence of a group or cluster enhancing the separation @xcite .",
    "parametric as well as free - form mass models also suggest that an external shear is mandatory to reproduce the image configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the lens galaxy is unaffected by quasar light allowing for a good fit .",
    "however , the photometric redshifts of a few neighbouring galaxies described in @xcite indicate that such cluster galaxies are probable companions of the lensed quasar rather than of the lens .",
    "the double he2149 might be a member of a cluster as inferred by @xcite by a large number of red non - stellar objects in r - band images of the field around the lens .",
    "considering recent estimates of the lens redshift from @xcite ( @xmath38 ) and the environment survey from @xcite he2149 could be in a group with 3 neighbouring objects .",
    "the morphology of the lens shows no sign of strong external shear .",
    "the doubly imaged quasar * sbs1520 + 530 * is treated like the previous doubles but with a star from the same image file in preference to other psfs .",
    "this lens is a member of a galaxy group with at least 4 other members as stated in @xcite .",
    "for the two quads * mg0414 + 0534 * , * rxj0911 + 0551 * and the double * q0957 + 561 * we obtain good residual maps by means of the iteration method .",
    "mg0414 at @xmath39 is the second most distant lens of our sample .",
    "judging by its luminosity and colour , the lens is likely to be a passively evolving early - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite find an object close to image b visible only in i - band , which might contribute to the lensing effect .",
    "our reconstructed mass map also shows increased surface density at the position of the object .",
    "rxj0911 is located on the outskirts of a cluster @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of the cluster suggest a complex non - spherical cluster mass distribution at a temperature of roughly 2.3  kev .",
    "q0957 , found by @xcite , is special in several ways .",
    "first there is a doubly imaged galaxy component in addition to the famous double quasar used to calculate the projected mass map .",
    "secondly the lens is a cd galaxy located in the centre of a cluster .",
    "the nearest cluster member lies within @xmath29 east of the lens galaxy .",
    "however a simple external shear is insufficient to describe the effect of the environment on the image positions . breaking the degeneracy between the shape of the galaxy and the cluster shear takes advantage of arc features @xcite and x - ray data as attempted by @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we describe all the lenses with suitable data in only one waveband .",
    "* b1030 + 071 * , * b1152 + 200 * and * b1600 + 434 * are treated similarly with regard to the fitting routine , i.e. the isolated outermost quasar image was used for subtraction and convolution .",
    "the three doubles have comparable angular image separations and average velocity dispersions as well as intermediate luminosities . observed substructures in b1030 indicate the presence of an interacting galaxy system @xcite although firm statements about the environment can not be made @xcite .",
    "however , shear is not strongly required by our mass model . for b1152",
    "there is no information about the composition of the environment .",
    "judging by the morphology of the image - source system no strong shear is expected .",
    "b1600 is located in a denser group with at least 6 late - type galaxies @xcite which cause significant shear .",
    "the absence of x - ray emission is suggestive of a not relaxed group , a conclusion strengthened by the elongated morphology of the group .",
    "furthermore the lens galaxy appears to be almost edge - on and exhibits a prominent dust lane . as remarked above , dust reddening",
    "changes the population synthesis input and leads to underestimated stellar content , but even for the extreme cases in our sample the effect of dust on inferred stellar masses can not be larger than 0.3 dex ( see appendix [ appa ] ) .    for the doubly imaged quasar * lbqs1009 - 0252 *",
    "the star in the h - band image of mg0414 is used again as a psf with sufficient quality for the fit . @xcite",
    "locate the lens galaxy close to quasar image b. they find that a dominant shear contribution of the host galaxy of a n earby quasar ( @xmath40 northwest of the lens  unrelated to the lensed quasar ) is consistent with the derived major axis of the lens when modeled by a singular isothermal ellipsoid . using a singular isothermal sphere model @xcite determine a smaller shear .",
    "@xcite state that there is no significant galaxy overdensity in the field .",
    "this is in agreement with the free - form lens models of this study , which do not require external shear for this lens .",
    "we now briefly describe three special cases , * b0218 + 357 * , * b1933 + 503 * and * rxj0921 + 4529*. with the first two we want to demonstrate the impact properties like small image separations and interfering luminous structures can have on the goodness of the sps .",
    "the third lens shows how spurious lenses , i.e. galaxies with nearby quasars which are not lensed images of the same background object , behave in this analysis .",
    "all three lenses are excluded from our analysis . + for b0218 as for 10 other systems in our sample a star was used to fit the quasar images in the h - band . since b0218 is the system with the smallest image separation ( @xmath41 ) known , it is extremely difficult to separate the lens galaxy from the images of the background quasar .",
    "the system is an extreme case in several aspects and a good example for showing the impact of degeneracies between the magnitudes of overlapping objects .",
    "b0218 unlike any other lens in the sample did not yield reasonable sersic profile parameters as the wings of the quasar psfs overlap with the lens . for an unconstrained fit the combined light from the quasar images and lens galaxy results most likely in an overestimated magnitude of the psfs .",
    "however after attempting to fit the lens system only by psfs , a sersic profile is needed to achieve an acceptable residual map .",
    "even though one can not obtain zero residuals by fitting only two point sources , there are several combinations of sersic profile magnitudes and two psf magnitudes that result in the same total surface brightness profile . bearing this in mind",
    ", we use the fitting parameters with the best @xmath42 , which also yields an acceptable residual map , to carry out the sps .",
    "the projected lens mass map shows that external potentials induce a shear in b0218 that was studied in @xcite .",
    "they find 13 possibly perturbing galaxies inside a radius of @xmath43 located roughly along the axis which connects the two quasar images .",
    "it should be mentioned that b0218 is according to @xcite a late - type galaxy which causes the sps to predict a different mass content .",
    "+ b1933 , discovered by @xcite , has 10 distinct images formed from a three - component source , promising an exceptionally well - constrained mass profile .",
    "a star in the same h - band image was used for convolution .",
    "there is as yet no study of the environment of the lens but according to the mass reconstruction , no strong shear is necessary to explain the morphology .",
    "the resolved features of the lensed background object can not be fitted by psf but are taken out of the fitting routine by using circular masks with a 5 pixel radius , a size chosen to cover features distinguishable from background and still show enough of the lens galaxy to allow for a reasonable fit . the trade - off between light contamination due to minimal masking and information loss due to aggressive",
    "masking is in any case problematic . in the case of b1933",
    "almost the whole inner region is surrounded by masked regions causing the fit parameters @xmath21 and @xmath44 to diverge .",
    "setting a constraint on the sersic index ( @xmath45 ) is necessary . despite all attempts at modeling this lens",
    ", it remained a persistent outlier , and hence is removed from the analysis .",
    "+ the double rxj0921 , has the highest angular image separation ( @xmath46 ) compared to any other lens in the sample . according to @xcite it is probably a member of an x - ray cluster . from model fits of the host galaxy @xcite",
    "conclude that rxj0921 is a binary quasar rather than a gravitational lens .",
    "also @xcite find quite different spectral properties in the spectra of the two components .",
    "for now we assume the system is a lens .",
    "since even the smaller lens - image distance is above @xmath47 and the quasar images are isolated , we obtain a high - quality fit by taking the quasar image as a psf for both overall convolution and quasar subtraction .",
    "no constraints are necessary .",
    "there are 16 objects within @xmath43 from the lens galaxy . only for three of them",
    "a redshift close to that of the lens could be determined .",
    "the mass model however does not require an external shear .",
    "in contrast to all other lenses , rxj0921 ( when treated as a lens ) turns out to exhibit an unusually low stellar - mass fraction and an almost constant @xmath9 profile .",
    "the peculiar properties of rxj0921 can be taken as further evidence against the lens hypothesis as suspected in aforementioned studies .",
    "in this section we describe necessary steps to obtain baryon - fraction profiles . as explained before we need to free the lens galaxies in given multiband data from interfering light , originating from quasar images , to obtain best - fitting surface brightness profiles .",
    "this reduction step is shown in the following paragraph .",
    "the output is used to constrain sps models and to estimate pixel - by - pixel the stellar mass via the colour - to - mass relation , as described in section [ sec2.2 ] . combining stellar mass estimates and pixel - based mass reconstruction ( section [ sec : lens ] ) yields baryon - fraction profiles for",
    "the given set of lens galaxies .",
    "the problems arising during this procedure can be assigned to one of the following categories : ( a )  finding an appropriate psf for convolution and point - source reduction , or ( b )  removing perturbing light sources that negatively affect the fitting procedure .",
    "the latter includes masking of image regions as well as fitting of additional light profiles to structures which clearly do not belong to the lens .",
    "since we use photometric data in different filters ( v , i and h bands ) , one of the following psf - picking procedures has to be suitably chosen for each band .    1 .",
    "find an isolated star from the same or a contemporaneous ( as nearly as possible ) image and extract it and a sufficiently large surrounding region not contaminated by light from the lens system or other sources ; hereafter referred to as the _ star - picking method_. 2 .",
    "select the outermost image of a lens system and use it for the quasar image fitting . while the lens galaxy and the other quasar images are fitted with galfit @xcite , the residual image , showing only the previously chosen outermost image without any contaminating light ,",
    "can then be taken as a qualitatively refined psf .",
    "this step can be repeated until we reach the desired level of enhancement .",
    "this procedure will be referred to as the _ iteration _ method . in some cases ,",
    "when the picked quasar image was sufficiently isolated , iteration brought no further improvement .",
    "3 .   using a synthetic psf generated by _ tinytim _",
    "@xcite yields better results for wfpc2 images rather than for nicmos data ( presumably due to the higher stability of wfpc2 psfs ) .",
    "methods ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) were combined with _ masking _ of quasar images or any other luminous structure interfering with the fit . to prevent the fit from diverging , in some cases further constraints are necessary .",
    "details of the constraints applied to each lens can be found in table  [ tab2 ] . in the following ,",
    "we give an overview of the types of constraints we have applied to the sample :    * fixing the sky background for the already reduced images to a value we determined with sextractor , since estimating the background is essential to extract a meaningful profile of the lens @xcite , ( low signal - to - noise objects are thus neglected , increasing the goodness of the fit for the generally bright lens galaxy ) , * fixing the surface brightness profiles to previously determined @xmath48 positions , * constraining @xmath21 and/or the sersic index @xmath44 , since both parameters are degenerate , being basically inversely related , i.e. constraining @xmath21 to a low value causes @xmath44 to diverge and vice versa , * constraining the position angle and the axis ratio to a physically appropriate range of values , and finally * restricting the range of magnitudes of the point sources , e.g. , constraining image a to be at least @xmath49 magnitudes brighter than image b.    except for the first two constraints , which are necessary for only a few lensing systems , we try to keep the number of degrees of freedom of the fit as high as possible and fix the parameters only if there is no alternative . in cases where the best - fit pa in one band was found to differ significantly from the pa in another band , it was necessary to constrain that parameter .",
    "the same applies to the axis ratio @xmath50 .",
    "if a highly eccentric ellipse is fitted to an actual round lens galaxy due to interfering psf wings , the parameter space must be constrained to exclude less likely @xmath50 values .",
    "since both the lensing galaxies and quasar images are in some cases too bright to be distinguishable in h - band , but too faint in v - band , we use the shape parameters pa or @xmath50 from i - band as a proxy for the fits in other bands .",
    "this was done for b1422 , bri0952 , hs0818 and q2237 .",

    ".   low mass galaxies show a shallower decline in their enclosed stellar - mass fraction than high mass galaxies : either their stellar content is less concentrated than in high mass galaxies or their dark matter content is more concentrated .",

    "the relative stellar - mass fraction of high versus low mass galaxies is significantly offset by a constant value within @xmath3 from the centre , i.e.    @xmath187    1 .   for @xmath188 .",

    "[ fig9 ] we show concentration versus redshift in the left - hand panel with no obvious correlation and the frequencies per concentration bin in the right - hand panel .",

    "[ fig9 ] the frequency distribution of @xmath206 peaks between @xmath207 and @xmath208 which is in agreement with most concentration studies of early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "that is , even with the redefined concentration quantities one can distinguish the lens galaxies morphologically .",
    "evidence is given by the two late - type galaxies q2237 and b1600 which indeed lie below 2.6 .",
    "for the two merging galaxies in the lens b1608 , the interfering potential ( for @xmath209 ) or light ( for @xmath206 ) , causes the concentration values to be decreased , pushing @xmath206 down to 2.6 . for the same reason we obtain rather large error bars on the lens mass .",
    "one could check in detail now if the strong correlation between @xmath203 and hubble - type is maintained for the newly defined @xmath206 .",
    "if we define a concentration parameter by means of the total mass profiles we expect , as our findings in section [ sec3 ] already suggest , a totally different distribution .",
    "most lenses exhibit @xmath209 values in a narrow region between 1.5 and 2 .",
    "however , neither in @xmath206 nor in @xmath209 can a clear evolutionary trend be found .",
    "figure [ fig9 - 2 ] shows that the concentration parameter for stellar mass @xmath206 has a rising trend with total lens mass , whereas @xmath209 clearly declines with lens mass .    note that the error bars of @xmath206 and @xmath209 are the standard errors of the @xmath210 values of each model in the ensemble multiplied by student s @xmath211 for a @xmath212 confidence interval .",
    "this was done since the ensemble can be seen as being part of a normal population .",
    "the horizontal error bars are the @xmath5 errors at the outermost radius of the reconstructed mass profile .",
    "as we can see at low total lens masses the distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are almost the same , which means that the @xmath5 profile approaches the distribution of the baryonic matter .",
    "an interaction between the baryonic and dark matter distribution seems to be a reasonable explanation , since already in section [ sec3 ] we find that the stellar - mass fractions of less massive lenses are larger than for the more massive lenses .",
    "a possible interaction between baryons and dark matter is likely to influence the slope of the total mass distribution close to the center of galaxies .",
    "if we assume a density following a pure power law @xmath213 the enclosed mass becomes @xmath214 .",
    "thus the concentration @xmath203 and the density slope obey the relation @xmath215 figure [ fig9 - 3 ] contrasts the relation between @xmath216 and @xmath203 based on a pure power law ( solid line ) and data for different radial extents .",
    "the @xmath216 values represent weighted best fits to lens mass profiles with standard errors from the fit .",

    "[ eq : beta ] we find that with increasing @xmath219  i.e. decreasing concentration ",
    "the slope @xmath216 gets shallower .",
    "it is remarkable how extraordinarily well the weighted power law fits neglecting the innermost point reproduce the simple @xmath220 model at low concentrations , but fail to do so at large concentrations , where the data lies below the pure power law relation .",
    "higher values of @xmath216 correspond to shallower @xmath5 profiles . including the innermost point always flattens @xmath9 fits , which explains why respective @xmath216 values , although less representative for the outer part of the profiles , are in better agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq : beta ] .",

    "[ fig9 - 3 ] ]              by means of the stellar mass content one can approach the subject of galaxy formation from a different viewpoint .",
    "the first question is : `` is it feasible to determine a characteristic quantity which gives us the amount of energy lost between the collapse of an initial sphere of homogeneously distributed baryons and its later state as a lens galaxy ? '' .",
    "one could ask as well for a ratio of the radius of the pre - collapse sphere and an observable spatial quantity , like the effective radius . even though this is a rough estimate , one can gain insight in the evolution process of galaxies .    at the time of collapse @xmath226 , a region decouples from the expansion of the surrounding universe .",
    "the baryons which are assumed to be homogeneously distributed in this sphere are for now assumed to make up the whole stellar content of the later lens galaxy , neglecting any kind of active evolution such as caused by mergers , ram pressure , tidal stripping , etc .",
    "the radius @xmath227 of such a sphere at @xmath226 is @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the baryonic energy density in terms of critical density according to @xcite and @xmath230 .",
    "the average newtonian energy per unit mass at @xmath226 consists only of the potential energy per unit mass , which is @xmath231 the total mass @xmath232 is defined here as @xmath233 as the collapse goes on the baryons start to fall in to build a more tightly bound structure . at the observation redshift ,",
    "i.e. at time @xmath234 , we find mostly objects which are in virial equilibrium , that is @xmath235 , where @xmath236 denotes kinetic energy .",
    "thus we can determine the total energy per unit mass of the galaxy at @xmath234 to be @xmath237 where @xmath238 is an effective velocity dispersion inferred from lensing ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",

    ".  [ eq1 ] , @xmath241 thus we get a quantity @xmath242 or @xmath243 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the kormendy relation , except that it relates to three - dimensional rather than projected densities . for definiteness",
    ", we assume a formation redshift @xmath244 , but the value only implies a multiplicative constant . plotting the energy ratio against the stellar - mass fraction , we find a strong correlation ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 - 2 ] ) regardless of the enclosure radius .",

    "[ fig13 - 2 ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath245 exhibits such a tight correlation with @xmath93 but no clear correlation to contributing masses , can be interpreted as insensitivity of the star formation in early - type galaxies to active evolution processes over the time span from @xmath246 to @xmath247 .",
    "a resolved , model - independent and thus non - degenerate ( w.r.t . @xmath4 and @xmath5 for fixed @xmath93 ) estimate of stellar versus total mass within galaxy halos is crucial to constrain current galaxy formation models and prescriptions of baryon - dark matter interactions used therein . besides dynamical methods to explore scales below 10 kpc the combination of strong gravitational lensing and population synthesis used in this paper is most promising to give robust estimates of stellar - mass fractions .",
    "the analysis of the radial dependence of the mass profiles of 21 castles lenses presented in this paper allows us to draw the following conclusions .",
    "the relation between basic galaxy properties , i.e. @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath78 can not simply be scaled with their mass .",
    "the scatter in this parameter space turns out to be especially large for galaxies of smaller size .",
    "the study of @xmath4 versus @xmath5 and of the stellar - mass fractions ( @xmath248 ) enables us to discriminate between lens galaxies below and above @xmath249 .",
    "the high mass class populates a lower and narrower @xmath93 regime ( 0.05 to 0.2 ) on given scales and runs out earlier of stellar mass ( i.e. at lower enclosed radius ) than low mass lenses .",
    "the latter exhibit a more inhomogeneous behaviour with a wider range in @xmath93 ( 0.1 to 0.5 ) and respective slopes .",
    "we conclude that between @xmath6 and @xmath7 dark matter halos start to dominate the matter balance depending on their total mass .",
    "this @xmath5-dependence causes high mass galaxies to gain mass primarily in the form of dark matter already at lower radii than low mass galaxies .",
    "therefore the slope of the mass - to - light relation , which is a projection of the fundamental plane  or our equivalent representation , @xmath250  becomes shallower with increasing radius and asymptotically approaches a slope of @xmath251 .",
    "thus the fp tilt can be recovered as a gradually growing process with radius .",
    "equivalently , the stellar - mass fraction shows a strong correlation to the total mass .",
    "as we contrast @xmath252 with a comparable curve deduced by abundance matching from @xcite dissimilarities for low @xmath5 galaxies become more evident the smaller the enclosed region gets .",
    "this is likely to be a result of different halo definitions , physical properties and processes , like baryon - dark matter interactions and adiabatic contraction which is beyond the scope of the aforementioned study .",
    "however , the @xmath93-to-@xmath192 relation scaled down to @xmath199 agrees quite well with lenses with @xmath253 , since the biggest part of stellar matter is still enclosed .",
    "another important result of this study addresses the concentration of stellar ( @xmath206 ) and total ( @xmath209 ) mass profiles .",
    "the rule - of - thumb delimiter of @xmath12 which separates early - type galaxies ( @xmath221 ) from late - types @xmath222 ) holds also for the concentration parameter ( @xmath206 ) defined by means of stellar mass instead of luminosity . in the low mass regime",
    "@xmath254 both , @xmath206 and @xmath209 , tend to similar values around 2.6 .",
    "this means that the total mass profile is likely to be influenced by the distribution of baryonic matter in stars . from @xmath255",
    "upwards , @xmath206 and @xmath209 diverge , due to a stronger confinement of stars in more massive dark matter halos .",
    "the @xmath209 values above @xmath142 stay around @xmath256 instead .",
    "studying the interdependency of density slope and @xmath209 we find that the reconstructed lens profiles show deviations from a pure power - law mass model , which is evidence for the sensitivity to the radial trends of the dark matter distribution .",

    "we run a set of simple stellar populations with solar metallicity , changing the age and the dust content .",

    "we find that dust `` conspires '' with age such that an increase in dust is compensated by a younger age to give the same colours , yielding a small variation of the estimated stellar mass with respect to dust reddening .",
    "most importantly , the value of @xmath42 worsens for high amounts of reddening .",
    "hence we can safely say that even in the case of b1600 and b1608 , the systematics on the stellar mass can not be any larger than about 0.3 dex in @xmath34 , shown as a shaded grey region in the middle panels of the figure . the other lens from our sample that could be affected by dust , q2237 ( i.e. the bulge of a late - type galaxy ) is at a very low redshift ( @xmath410 ) , so that stellar masses are determined from _ rest - frame _ h - band , which is even less sensitive to dust @xcite .",

    "<S> the sample covers a stellar mass range of @xmath0 ( solar masses ) which corresponds to a total enclosed mass range of @xmath1 on radial scales from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( effective radii ) . by examining the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence on radial distance to the centre of each galaxy </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are pairs of lenses on small to intermediate mass scales which approach at large radii the same values for their enclosed total mass but exhibit very different stellar masses and stellar baryon fractions . </S>",
    "<S> this peculiar behaviour subsides for the most massive lensing galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> most of the stellar component is enclosed . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a stellar baryon fraction steadily declining over the full mass range . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we shed light on the fundamental plane puzzle by showing that the slope of the @xmath9-to-@xmath10 relation approaches the mass - to - light relation of recent fundamental plane studies at large radii . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce novel concentration indices @xmath11 for stellar and total mass profiles ( i.e. , the ratio of radii enclosing 90% and 50% of the stellar or total mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the value @xmath12 originally determined by light profiles which separates early - type galaxies from late - type galaxies also holds for stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , less massive dark matter halos turn out to be influenced by the distribution of stellar matter on resolved scales below 10 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the ongoing study of resolved baryon fraction profiles will make it possible to evaluate the validity of star formation models as well as adiabatic contraction prescriptions commonly used in simulations . </S>"
