    "string theory contains various extended objects such as fundamental strings , solitonic five - branes , and @xmath3-branes .",
    "these objects are known to couple to the standard background fields ; the @xmath4-field or the ramond - ramond fields .",
    "if we consider a compactification on a seven - torus , @xmath5 , there arise additional objects , called _ exotic branes _ @xcite .",
    "the exotic branes can exist only in the presence of compact isometry directions , just like the kaluza - klein monopoles , and have the tension proportional to @xmath6 with @xmath7 . among them , a @xmath8-brane , which has two isometry directions , has been well - studied recently @xcite . since the @xmath8 background has a non - vanishing ( magnetic ) _",
    "@xcite , we can identify the @xmath8-brane as an object that magnetically couples to a bi - vector field @xmath9 whose derivative gives the @xmath2-flux .",
    "this can be shown more explicitly by writing down the worldvolume effective action of the @xmath8-brane @xcite .",
    "if we perform an @xmath10-duality transformation , the @xmath8-brane is mapped to another exotic brane , called a @xmath11-brane , which is a member of a family of exotic @xmath12-branes , denoted by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "if we adopt a notation used in @xcite , the exotic @xmath12-brane , which has @xmath14 special isometry directions , is denoted by @xmath15 since the mass is written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the extending directions while @xmath18 are the special isometry directions .",
    "they are also called the higher kaluza - klein branes @xcite , since the quadratic dependence on the radii in the isometry directions is similar to the case of the kaluza - klein monopole , kk5@xmath19 . for the special case of @xmath20 ,",
    "we frequently denote it by ns7 instead of @xmath21 .",
    "the duality relation between the standard branes and the exotic branes is summarized in figure [ fig : exotic ] .        in spite of the presence of a symmetric structure between the exotic branes and the usual branes ( see figure [ fig : exotic ] ) , little",
    "is known about the exotic branes ; e.g. , the background fields which couple to the exotic branes have not been studied in detail , other than the case of the @xmath8-brane .",
    "the main interest in this paper is to identify the background fields which couple to the exotic branes and to write down the effective supergravity action for the background fields . for the @xmath8-brane",
    ", the relevant background field is a bi - vector @xmath9 which is a function of the standard ns - ns fields .",
    "the effective theory for the @xmath1-field has been constructed in a series of works @xcite and is called the _",
    "@xmath1-supergravity_. on the other hand , for the @xmath13-brane , the relevant background field is expected to be a @xmath14-vector @xmath22 whose derivative is called the non - geometric _ @xmath23-flux _ ( see @xcite where the @xmath24-fields are introduced in the study of the exceptional generalized geometry , @xcite where the relation between mixed - symmetry tensors and exotic branes is discussed , @xcite where the effective @xmath11-brane action is written down and the @xmath11-brane is found to couple to a bi - vector @xmath25 magnetically , and @xcite where a possible relation between the polyvectors @xmath24 and exotic branes is discussed ) . however , the definition of the @xmath24-fields and the effective action for the @xmath24-fields are still not fully understood .    in this paper , assuming the existence of some isometry directions , we construct effective actions for various mixed - symmetry tensors that couple to exotic branes .",
    "we consider the cases of the exotic @xmath8-brane , the @xmath26-brane , and the @xmath13-brane , and argue that these exotic branes are the magnetic sources of the non - geometric fluxes associated with polyvectors @xmath9 , @xmath27 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "as it is well - known , an exotic - brane background written in terms of the usual background fields is not single - valued and has a @xmath0-duality monodromy . however , with a suitable redefinition of the background fields , the @xmath0-duality monodromy of the exotic - brane background simply becomes a gauge transformation associated with a shift in a polyvector ( which corresponds to a natural extension of the _ @xmath1-transformation _ known in the generalized geometry ) .",
    "this kind of field redefinition and the rewriting of the action in terms of the new background fields are the main tasks of this paper .",
    "we further find a new instanton solution that corresponds to the electric source of the non - geometric flux , whose existence has been anticipated in section 7 of @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : supergravity - description ] , we review the supergravity description of various defect branes with an emphasis on the _ exotic duality _ @xcite , which relates the objects described in the upper half ( exotic branes ) and the lower half ( standard branes ) of figure [ fig : exotic ] . in section [",
    "sec : beta - sugra ] , we review the @xmath1-supergravity and examine the @xmath8-brane as the magnetic source of the @xmath2-flux .",
    "we also find an instanton solution of the @xmath1-supergravity that has the electric charge associated with the @xmath2-flux . in section [ sec : s - dual - bega ] , utilizing the techniques of the @xmath1-supergravity , we derive the effective action for the bi - vector @xmath25 ( whose derivative gives the non - geometric @xmath23-flux ) , and find a ( geometric ) solution that corresponds to the @xmath28-brane . in section",
    "[ sec : exotic - p - branes ] , we derive the effective actions for various polyvectors and show that the ( reduced ) action of the @xmath1-supergravity and the action obtained in section [ sec : s - dual - bega ] are reproduced as special cases .",
    "we then find two kinds of solutions with either the magnetic or the electric charge associated with the non - geometric flux .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we review the supergravity solutions corresponding to various defect branes , and discuss the @xmath29 duality @xcite which relates the standard branes and the exotic branes . in the following ,",
    "we basically follow the notations of @xcite .",
    "all defect - brane backgrounds considered in this paper can be obtained from the following seven - brane background by performing the @xmath30- and @xmath10-dualities : @xmath31 this background satisfies the equations of motion for the type iib supergravity as long as the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are holomorphic functions of @xmath34 . in the following ,",
    "we choose them as @xmath35 $ ] ( @xmath36 : positive constant ) and @xmath37 , which makes the above background the well - known d7 background . here , the value of @xmath38 depends on the duality frame ( see table [ tab : sigma ] ) and it is now given by the string coupling constant ; @xmath39 .",
    ".values of the dimensionless constant @xmath38 in various duality frames .",
    "the directions @xmath40 , @xmath18 , and @xmath41 are the same as those appearing in the expressions for the background fields . [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the equations of motion are given by @xmath42 if we regard the dual potential @xmath43 as a fundamental field , the dual action is given by @xmath44    & = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa_{10}^2}\\ ,      \\int \\biggl[{\\operatorname{e}^{-2\\phi}}\\,\\bigl(\\tilde{*}\\,\\tilde{r } + 4\\,{{\\mathrm{d}}}\\phi\\wedge \\tilde{*}\\,{{\\mathrm{d}}}\\phi\\bigr ) \\\\   & \\quad\\qquad\\qquad    - \\frac{{\\operatorname{e}^{2\\,(\\tilde{\\alpha}+1)\\,\\tilde{\\phi}}}}{2\\,(7-p)!}\\,\\tilde{g}^{i_1j_1}\\cdots \\tilde{g}^{i_{7-p}j_{7-p}}\\ ,     { { \\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathcal a}^{(8)}_{i_1\\cdots i_{7-p}}\\wedge \\tilde{*}\\ , { { \\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathcal a}^{(8)}_{j_1\\cdots j_{7-p}}\\biggr ] \\ , , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath45 .",
    "we can add the wess - zumino term of the exotic @xmath46-brane extending in the @xmath47-directions and smeared over the @xmath48-directions : @xmath49 then , taking variation , we obtain the following bianchi identity as the equation of motion : @xmath50 if we choose @xmath51 and integrate the equation , we obtain @xmath52 where we used @xmath53 . from this relation and the value of @xmath38 given in table [ tab : sigma ] , we can confirm that @xmath54 is indeed equal to the tension of the exotic brane : @xmath55 where we used @xmath56 .",
    "in this paper , we have presented ( truncated ) effective actions for various polyvectors whose magnetic sources can be identified with the exotic branes . requiring the existence of compact isometry directions , which are required for the existence of exotic branes , we showed that the effective actions can be derived from the standard ( truncated ) supergravity actions . in each theory , we found two solutions with either the magnetic or the electric charge associated with the non - geometric flux .",
    "the former solution corresponds to an exotic - brane background while the latter corresponds to a new instanton background . by taking account of the @xmath0-duality symmetry of the string theory ,",
    "all defect branes including the standard branes and exotic branes should be treated as equals . however , in the standard formulation of the supergravity , only the backgrounds of the standard branes are well described globally .",
    "contrarily , in the reformulation of supergravity presented in this paper , the background fields of the exotic branes are globally defined while those of the standard branes are not single - valued . in this sense , the effective theory considered in this paper is complementary to the standard supergravity .",
    "our reformulation is still not complete and we should investigate a further generalization so as to allow for general backgrounds with multiple non - geometric fluxes .",
    "such generalization is necessary if we consider , for example , the background representing a bound state of @xmath12 @xmath8-branes and @xmath57 @xmath28-branes , which is the exotic dual of the @xmath58 five - brane ( i.e. , a bound state of @xmath12 ns5-branes and @xmath57 d5-branes ) . in addition , there is another direction of generalization .",
    "the action presented in this paper can be applied only for defect backgrounds with isometries in the @xmath59-directions . in the absence of these isometries ,",
    "the action should be modified , like the action of the @xmath1-supergravity or its ramond - ramond counterpart . since the equations of motion derived from the simple action do not coincide with those derived from the complete action ( i.e. , the action or ) even though we impose the assumptions , -supergravity , if we assume that any derivative @xmath60 contracted with @xmath9 vanishes , the dilaton equation of motion and the einstein equations ( see ( 1.28 ) and ( 1.29 ) of @xcite ) coincide with those derived from the simple action ( note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be shown by using the simplifying assumption ) .",
    "however , the equation of motion for the @xmath1-field ( see ( 1.30 ) of @xcite ) does not coincide with , although the difference disappears in the @xmath8 background . ]",
    "it will be important to find the complete actions for any value of @xmath12 and check whether the exotic - brane backgrounds indeed satisfy the equations of motion derived from the complete actions .-",
    "brane ( or the @xmath2-brane ) , the background is shown to satisfy the equations of motion derived from the complete action ( see appendix d.1 of @xcite ) . ]",
    "it will be also interesting to describe various non - geometric backgrounds with less isometries , such as the background of the `` ns5-brane localized in winding space '' constructed in @xcite ( see also the references therein ) , as solutions of the complete theory without simplifying assumptions .",
    "further , it will be important to establish a formulation in which the background of an arbitrary defect brane can be equally described globally ; that is , a manifestly @xmath0-duality covariant formulation of the supergravity theory . a promising approach in this direction is taken in dft , which can globally describe both the usual brane ( i.e.  ns5-brane ) and the exotic brane ( i.e.  @xmath8-brane ) , and can reproduce the standard supergravity action or the @xmath1-supergravity action as a special limit . although dft has already been generalized to incorporate the ramond - ramond fields @xcite , we can not globally describe @xmath0-folds ( such as the @xmath13 background ) in the framework of dft , since the generalized coordinate transformations in dft do not include general @xmath0-dual transformations .",
    "recently , several generalizations of dft have been studied in various papers ( see e.g.  @xcite , and @xcite where the _ exceptional field theory _ has been proposed and studied ) , which will be possible to describe all exotic - brane backgrounds globally",
    ". it will be interesting to derive the effective theories proposed in this paper as some special limits of these theories",
    ".    it will be also important to investigate a reformulation of the effective worldvolume theory of exotic branes by using the newly introduced background fields @xmath63 .",
    "more generally , it will be important to find a manifestly @xmath0-duality covariant formulation for the effective worldvolume theory of exotic branes .    in our reformulation of the supergravity where a @xmath12-vector is regarded as a fundamental field",
    ", there naturally appears the background of an instanton that electrically couples to a @xmath12-vector .",
    "depending on the type of the @xmath12-vector ( i.e.  @xmath9 , @xmath22 , or @xmath27 ) , the value of the on - shell action for the instanton background is expected to be proportional to @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "since these instantons have not been studied well , it will be important to analyze their properties further .",
    "since the @xmath66 backgrounds are similar to the backgrounds of the d@xmath12-instantons ( see @xcite and references therein ) , it will be natural to expect that the instantons @xmath66 are the exotic dual of the d@xmath12-instantons , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are their @xmath10-dual objects .",

    "we would like to thank yolanda lozano and soo - jong rey for helpful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we show that the action can be rewritten as under the assumption .",
    "let us recall that , under a rescaling of the metric @xmath69 in a @xmath70-dimensional space , the ricci scalar transforms as @xmath71\\,{\\mathsf{g}}^{ij}\\,\\partial_i\\sigma\\,\\partial_j\\sigma\\bigr\\}\\ , , \\label{eq : r - formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the covariant derivative and the ricci scalar associated with the new metric @xmath74 . using the formula",

    "let us consider the einstein frame , @xmath79 , where the action takes the following form : @xmath80 where the boundary term is dropped . here ,",
    "note that , under the ansatz , the ricci scalar @xmath73 can be decomposed as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the two - dimensional ricci scalar associated with the metric @xmath83 .",
    "now , we make a further redefinition of the metric @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a function to be specified below .",
    "then , the formula gives @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the covariant derivative and the ricci scalar associated with the two - dimensional metric @xmath89 .",
    "that is , two ricci scalars @xmath73 and @xmath90 ( that is associated with the metric @xmath91 ) are related to each other through @xmath92 using this relation , we can rewrite the action as @xmath93   { \\nonumber}\\\\   & \\quad - \\int\\frac{{{\\mathrm{d}}}^{10}x\\ , \\sqrt{{{\\lvert \\tilde{{\\mathsf{g } } } \\rvert}}}}{2\\,(7-p)!}\\,{\\operatorname{e}^{-2{\\bm{\\varphi}}}}\\,\\tilde{{\\mathsf{g}}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf{b}}}\\ ,            \\tilde{{\\mathsf{g}}}_{{\\mathbf{r}}_1{\\mathbf{s}}_1}\\cdots \\tilde{{\\mathsf{g}}}_{{\\mathbf{r}}_{7-p}{\\mathbf{s}}_{7-p}}\\ ,            \\partial_{\\mathbf{a}}\\gamma^{{\\mathbf{r}}_1\\cdots { \\mathbf{r}}_{7-p}}\\,\\partial_{\\mathbf{b}}\\gamma^{{\\mathbf{s}}_1\\cdots { \\mathbf{s}}_{7-p } } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we dropped a boundary term in the second equality and used @xmath94 in the third equality .    if we choose the function @xmath85 as @xmath95 the action becomes @xmath96 where we rescaled the dilaton ; @xmath97 . finally ,",
