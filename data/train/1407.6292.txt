    "according to the black hole a black hole formed by the gravitational collapse of a charged rotating star , will rapidly relaxes to the stationary state , characterized by three quantities , its mass , charge and angular momentum@xcite .",
    "any other _ hair _ will disappear after the collapsing body settles down to its stationary state .",
    "configurations violating the generalized no - hair conjecture were also presented including black holes dressed with yang - mills@xcite , skyrme@xcite and dilaton@xcite fields , in various combinations with higgs fields@xcite . even though most of these black holes are found to be unstable , there are few stable solutions also . by analyzing the stability of a black hole solution of the einstein - yang - mills equations in the framework of small time - dependent perturbations",
    "it was shown that there is at least one exponentially growing radial mode with the correct boundary conditions at the horizon and at infinity@xcite .",
    "it was proven that there are unstable modes of the bartnik - mckinnon soliton and the non - abelian black hole solution of the einstein - yang - mills theory for the gauge group su(2)@xcite .",
    "the manner and rate with which the hairs of the black hole decay is thus an important question .",
    "it was richard price@xcite who , making a perturbative analysis of the collapse of a nearly spherical star , showed that for a field with spin , s , any radiative multipole ( @xmath3 ) gets radiated away completely , in the late stage of collapse .",
    "further , he showed that at late times the field dies out with a power - law tail @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , if the multipoles were initially static and @xmath6 otherwise .",
    "price s theorem was verified for various field perturbations around different black hole spacetimes in asymptotically flat spacetimes@xcite .    in the past two decades",
    "there have been growing observational evidences@xcite which established clearly that our universe is expanding in an accelerated pace , indicating the presence of some mysterious form of repulsive energy called dark energy . in order to explain the nature of dark energy ,",
    "several models have been proposed . the simplest option being einstein s cosmological constant(@xmath7 ) , which has a constant equation of state with state parameter , @xmath8 , but it needs extreme fine tuning to account for the observations@xcite .",
    "models were proposed , replacing @xmath7 with a dynamical , time - dependent and spatially inhomogeneous component now called quintessence , which can have an equation of state , @xmath9@xcite .",
    "quintessence hypothesis is found to fit current observations and more precise measurements may separate the two models in future .",
    "so it is interesting to check price s theorem for a black hole with nonflat asymptotes .    for black holes in",
    "asymptotically de sitter spacetimes , a generalization of price s theorem was presented in@xcite , for massless small fluctuations .",
    "later the classical black hole no - hair theorems were extended to spacetimes endowed with a positive @xmath7 for different fields@xcite . in the perturbative study of price s theorem ,",
    "the late - time decay is determined by the asymptotic curvature of the spactime@xcite .",
    "the studies on the time evolution of scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations , propagating on black hole with asymptotically de sitter like spacetime revealed the existence of an exponentially decaying tails at late times contrasting the power - law tails in asymptotically flat situation@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the late - time evolution of dirac field around a black hole whose asymptotes are determined by quintessence . for black hole with asymptotically flat spacetimes , the late - time behavior of dirac field is well understood @xcite .",
    "the intermediate and late - time behavior of massive dirac field , in the static spherically symmetric general black hole spacetime , is studied in @xcite .",
    "the late - time behavior of a massive dirac field in the background of dilaton and brane - world black hole solutions is investigated in @xcite .",
    "it is revealed that for black hole in flat spacetimes , the long - lived oscillatory tail of massive dirac field , decays as @xmath10 .    for schwarzschild - de sitter(sds )",
    "black holes , the quasinormal modes(qnms ) of decay had been calculated for fields of different spin , including dirac field @xcite .",
    "the qnms of dirac field around black holes surrounded by quintessence were calculated in@xcite .",
    "but the late - time behavior of dirac fields in these spacetimes is not clear .",
    "recently , a proof of the no - hair theorem corresponding to perturbative massive spin-1/2 fields for stationary axisymmetric de sitter black hole is presented@xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to see how does dirac field evolve in a spacetime in which the asymptotic structure is altered by the quintessence field .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect.[sec2 ] we introduce the master wave equation for dirac field perturbations around black hole surrounded by quintessence . the numerical method used to study the time evolution",

    "our study indicates that there may be static solutions for dirac field for all @xmath2 for black holes with de - sitter like asymptotes .",
