    "astrophysical magnetic fields have long been recognized to be important but difficult to understand .",
    "a prominent example concerns accretion disks @xcite , where orbiting plasmas gradually accrete onto a central mass .",
    "three types of central object occur : protostars ( stars in formation ) , collapsed stars in binary systems ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes ) , and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( quasars _ et al . _ ) .",
    "in addition to the accretion process , jets and other spectacular phenomena may be magnetically driven by the disk @xcite . understanding the dynamics and dissipation mechanisms in accretion disks holds an important key to understanding many active astronomical systems as a whole .",
    "the accretion rates can not be due to ordinary molecular or plasma viscosity because of the extraordinarily high reynolds numbers involved .",
    "theorists have often appealed to hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , but recent numerical simulations indicate that nonmagnetic disks are stabilized by their positive angular momentum gradient @xcite ; in effect , rayleigh s stability criterion appears to suppress local nonaxisymmetric as well as axisymmetric disturbances @xcite .",
    "linear axisymmetric instability of a _",
    "magnetized _ but rayleigh - stable fluid , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , was discovered decades ago @xcite but did not come to the attention of the astrophyisical community until recently rediscovered @xcite , despite general recognition that magnetic effects might somehow be important @xcite . since then",
    ", many analytic and numerical studies of the mri have been performed under increasingly complex and realistic assumptions , including such effects as finite resistivity , global boundary conditions , and nonlinearity in two and three dimensions @xcite .    despite its popularity and importance ,",
    "however , the mri has never been realized in the laboratory or demonstrated observationally .",
    "laboratory plasma experiments are primarily magnetically driven , and the observed flows , often induced as secondary effects of other instabilities , are small compared to the alfvn speed . on the other hand , the existing body of experimental work on magnetized couette flow using liquid metals @xcite has focused on magnetic stabilization of the rayleigh instability , as first analyzed by chandrasekhar . in this letter",
    ", we explore the feasibility of a couette - flow experiment dedicated to mri .",
    "couette flow involves a liquid confined between rotating coaxial cylinders @xcite .",
    "let their radii be @xmath0 , and their angular velocities @xmath1 , @xmath2",
    ". in steady state , the radial angular momentum flux , @xmath3 , is constant with radius , where @xmath4 is the depth of the liquid , @xmath5 is its density , and @xmath6 is its kinematic viscosity . if @xmath7 , then the angular velocity of the liquid satisfies @xmath8const .",
    ", so that @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 the rayleigh stability criterion is @xmath12 .    the dynamics of liquid metals is well described by the incompressible and dissipative magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is velocity , @xmath15 is magnetic field , @xmath16 is magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath17 is a scalar potential incorporating both pressure and gravity . in cylindrical coordinates ,",
    "the equilibrium quantities are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the balance of forces is @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "wkbj methods describe the stability of this system very well even on the largest scales .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates , the perturbations are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , all proportional to @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 is the growth rate and the perturbations are axisymmetric .",
    "the minimum @xmath26 and @xmath27 are assumed to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , so that the total wavenumber @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the elongation of a toroidal cross - section of the liquid metal annulus .",
    "the linearized equations of motion are @xmath32 where the epicyclic frequency is defined by @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the perturbed pressure .",
    "the vertical induction equation is not needed since @xmath35 can be deduced from @xmath36 .",
    "these equations lead to the following dispersion relation : @xmath37 ^ 2{k^2 \\over k_z^2 } & + & \\kappa^2(\\gamma + \\eta k^2)^2\\\\ & + & { { \\partial}\\omega^2 \\over { \\partial}\\ln r}(k_zv_a)^2=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the alfvn speed is @xmath38 .",
    "this dispersion relation is identical to the one derived for accretion disks in the incompressible limit @xcite .    introducing a dimensionless vorticity parameter , @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 so that the rayleigh stability criterion becomes @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , @xmath42 .",
    "there are three other relevant frequencies : resistive , @xmath43 ; viscous , @xmath44 ; and alfvnic @xmath45 .",
    "because liquid metals are far more resistive than viscous , @xmath46 serves as a base frequency in the following three dimensionless parameters : magnetic prandtl number , @xmath47 ; lundquist number , @xmath48 ; and magnetic reynolds number , @xmath49 .",
    "the astrophysical literature gives several inequivalent definitions of `` magnetic reynolds number , '' some corresponding to our @xmath50 .",
    "some involve the sound speed , @xmath51 , for although mri is essentially noncompressive , vertical force balance in an astrophysical disk relates @xmath51 to the half - thickness : @xmath52 . the free energy for mri derives from differential rotation , represented in our dimensionless system by a combination of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; but magnetic field , represented by @xmath50 , is required to liberate this energy from hydrodynamic constraints .    using the normalized growth rate , @xmath55 ,",
    "the dispersion relation can be rewritten as @xmath56 ^ 2(1+\\epsilon^2 ) \\qquad&&\\nonumber\\\\ + 2\\zeta { r_{\\rm m}}^2(\\gamma+1)^2 -2(2-\\zeta){r_{\\rm m}}^2s^2&=&0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown that there are no purely imaginary roots for @xmath25 as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath57 for real and nonzero @xmath58 . from the imaginary part of the equation above , one finds @xmath59 substituting this into the real part yields @xmath60 this is a quadratic equation in @xmath53 which must be real .",
    "but the discriminant @xmath61 is negative unless @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "hence there are no purely oscillatory modes . on the other hand ,",
    "all roots of the dispersion relation for @xmath25 have negative real parts as @xmath64 ( nonrotating flow ) .",
    "hence the transition to instability occurs through @xmath65 , and the necessary and sufficient condition for stability is that the value of the dispersion relation at @xmath65 remain positive as @xmath54 increases : @xmath66 which can be taken into various limits .    * nonmagnetic limit*. as @xmath67 , the three terms @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 approach zero faster than the others , leading to the stability condition @xmath71 .",

    "periodic boundary conditions were used in @xmath109 .",
    "radial boundaries were impenetrable and no - slip ( @xmath110 ) , and electrically either perfectly insulating or perfectly conducting .",
    "results are compared with the wkbj analysis in figs.2 and 3 .",
    "figure  4 shows eigenmodes for the parameters of point c with @xmath111=0.3 tesla .",
    "differences between the conducting and insulating cases can be seen near the inner boundaries . a hartmann layer @xcite , consisting of large toroidal and axial velocities within a radial thickness of @xmath112 mm ( not visible in fig .",
    "4 ) , forms at the inner conducting boundary as the lorentz force , @xmath113 , balances with the viscous force .",
    "nevertheless , the growth rates are remarkably similar to those of the local analysis , which therefore should suffice for preliminary experimental design . [ details of the global analysis",
    "will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "]    = 3.0 in    = 3.0 in    a fully nonlinear incompressible mhd code has been developed to study the problem in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "initial results from linear and two - dimensional runs of this code with conducting , freely - slipping boundary conditions agree with the local and global analyses .",
    "for example , for the conditions given by the point c in figs.2 and 3 at @xmath114tesla , the growth rate is 21.67 s@xmath115 from simulations , 21.90 s@xmath115 from global analysis , and 19.10 s@xmath115 from local analysis .",
    "several issues must be explored before committing to an experimental design .",
    "the first is geometric optimization with regard to aspect ratio [ @xmath116 and elongation [ @xmath117 ) ] . obviously , @xmath118 is desirable to minimize volume , and therefore expense , at a given growth rate .",
    "less obviously , aspect ratios close to unity cause the eigenmodes and growth rates to be dominated by the inner cylinder , which is undesirable if the aim is to imitate relatively uniform local conditions within an astrophysical disk . therefore , moderate values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 are preferred .",
    "the periodic vertical boundary conditions used in all of our analyses take no account of viscous layers at the top and bottom of the flow .",
    "( the top will have to be capped because of large radial pressure gradients . )",
    "the main effect of these viscous boundary layers is to drive ekman circulation , which flows more rapidly against a weak angular - momentum gradient than against uniform rotation .",
    "the thickness of the ekman layer @xmath121 is small ( @xmath122 at point c ) , and the ekman circulation time @xmath123 2  s is much longer than a typical mri growth time , so we do not expect these layers to be important for stability . to further minimize their effect , if necessary",
    ", one could increase @xmath84 , use differentially rotating rings at the vertical boundaries , or modify the boundary layer by localized lorentz forces @xcite .",
    "a third issue is finite - amplitude or nonlinear hydrodynamical instability in rayleigh - stable regimes .",
    "few theoretical studies on this subject exist @xcite .",
    "it has been argued from experiments that a rapid couette flow can be nonlinearly unstable @xcite . however , there are indications that such instabilities are caused by wall surface defects @xcite , which can be minimized .",
    "in fact , it has been shown numerically that a positive angular - momentum gradient strongly resists nonlinear instability @xcite .",
    "the outcome depends , however , on the amplitude of the initial perturbation and the strength of the angular - momentum gradient .",
    "these questions could be addressed empirically and relatively inexpensively in prototype experiments using water .",
    "one would like to predict the nonlinear phases of mri in the laboratory system .",
    "ultimately , nonlinear mri is closely related to other important physics of accretion disks involving magnetic field , i.e. , dynamo processes and jet formation .",
    "ongoing three - dimensional mhd simulations @xcite will provide useful insights here . indeed , an important purpose of the experiment is to be a testbed for mhd codes since , lacking detailed observational constraints , theorists depend upon computer simulations to understand mri - driven turbulence .    the experiment will be far more resistive than most accretion disks , though perhaps not all @xcite .",
    "simulations indicate that when the field is generated by the disk itself ( magnetic dynamo ) , then the large - scale field is nearly toroidal , the important instabilities are nonaxisymmetric , and the turbulence sustains itself only if @xmath50 and @xmath54 are much larger than the experiment proposed here will achieve @xcite . on the other hand , the innermost ( and therefore most energetic ) parts of accretion disks often encounter a vertical field due to the central compact object .",
    "the works cited above find that in the presence of an imposed vertical field , turbulence is driven by axisymmetric modes and persists to higher resistivity , probably into the experimentally accessible regime .    in summary ,",
    "we have used linear stability analyses to explore the prospects for magnetorotational instability in a magnetized couette flow .",
    "we find that mri can be achieved in a moderately rapidly rotating table - top apparatus using an easy - to - handle liquid metal such as gallium .",
    "auxiliary experiments with an inexpensive nonmagnetic fluid , such as water , will be valuable both as prototypes and as controls to distinguish mri from nonlinear hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "onset and dynamics of mri can be detected by torque measurements of cylinders and magnetic sensors placed around the annulus .",
    "ultrasonic imaging may also be possible .",
    "if successful , this will be a rare example of an astrophysical process that can be studied in the laboratory .",
