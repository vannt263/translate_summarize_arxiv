    "the model is thus a theory of @xmath33 low - lying modes which respect chiral symmetry and whose interaction matrix elements @xmath34 are drawn on a gaussian distribution .",
    "the number of modes scales with the volume of the system ; the thermodynamic limit is taken as @xmath35 .    for later comparisons , it is useful to understand how the gauge group is taken into account . in a model which implements the global symmetries of qcd with @xmath5 ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath29 are complex . for the analysis below ,",
    "it is worth noting that their real and imaginary parts satisfy no particular relationship and are thus drawn independently .",
    "this case corresponds to a dyson index @xmath36 and is described by the chiral unitary ensemble ( @xmath2gue ) . for @xmath13 , the gauge group is pseudoreal as mentioned above .",
    "the dirac operator then contains an additional antiunitary symmetry  @xcite , which allows one to choose a basis in which the matrix elements of @xmath29 are real .",

    ", the value of @xmath37 enters @xmath2rmt only through the reality of the matrix elements of @xmath29 .    in model",

    "note that the subblock associated with flavor @xmath42 has been transposed in order to exhibit the possibility of forming @xmath45 condensates ( see i ) .",
    "the diagonal block @xmath44 now reflects both chiral and color symmetries . in order to be able to define an order parameter which is antisymmetric under the permutation of an odd number of quantum numbers , spin has to be introduced together with color  @xcite .",
    "the dirac operator @xmath44 then has the chiral structure of eq .",

    ", the thermodynamic limit corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "evidently , these spin and color substructures impose strong constraints between the real and imaginary parts of the matrix elements of @xmath29 .",
    "consider , for example , the contributions to @xmath61 , eqs .",
    "( [ zcolor ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , of the random matrices @xmath62 ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 .",
    "their matrix elements are real and are drawn independently . when combined to form @xmath29 as prescribed in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , the matrix elements of @xmath62 multiply @xmath66 , a real diagonal spin matrix , and @xmath67 , a real color matrix .",
    "hence , @xmath62 contributes to the real part of @xmath29 only .",
    "similarly , the matrix elements of @xmath65 combine with @xmath66 ( real ) and @xmath68 , an imaginary color matrix .",
    "they thus contribute to the imaginary part of @xmath29 .",
    "hence , in contrast to ordinary @xmath2rmt , the matrix elements of @xmath29 are complex for both @xmath69 and @xmath13 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath29 arise from well - defined combinations of the matrix elements of @xmath53 .",
    "their statistical distributions are then dictated by the content of the spin and color block matrices , which thus introduce well - defined correlations .",
    "do these additional correlations preserve those imposed in eq .",

    "the @xmath29 matrix elements are complex for all @xmath37 ; their real and imaginary parts are no longer independent random variables . one",
    "might thus be concerned that the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator would differ from those of the @xmath2gue and @xmath2goe .",
    "we now consider a number of spectral properties to indicate that this is _ not _ the case and that the additional color symmetries do not alter the statistical properties due to chiral symmetry .",
    "as an initial measure of the statistical properties , we consider the spectral density @xmath70 , defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the @xmath33 eigenvalues of the dirac operator and @xmath73 denotes an ensemble average . while @xmath70 is not universal in the usual random matrix sense , we will focus on those symmetry properties which are expected to be protected .",
    "consider first the chiral random matrix model defined in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) . because of the block structure of @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , the eigenvalues @xmath72 occur in pairs of opposite signs .",

    "( [ zcolor ] ) , which may seem different at first glance because of its more elaborate structure .",
    "in fact , each flavor subblock has the same chiral substructure as in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , and the eigenvalue spectrum remains symmetric about @xmath74 .",
    "further , the eigenvalues of @xmath75 , eq . ( [ zcolor ] ) , are degenerate with those of @xmath44 so that the spectrum is again twofold degenerate ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "hence , the same basic chiral and flavor symmetries prevail in the two models .    in order to facilitate numerical evaluation",
    ", we now consider the quenched limit @xmath77 .",
    "this limit is free from contributions from vacuum graphs ( through powers of the determinant of the dirac operator in the partition function ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "the ensemble average of a given quantity then amounts to a mere counting of the contributions from the individual eigenvalues of @xmath27 ( or @xmath61 ) , distributed according to the normal laws of eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) , as appropriate .    for large matrices , we find that the model i is numerically consistent with the ( non universal ) semicircle law familiar from the @xmath2gue and @xmath2goe , @xmath78 in the case of chiral random matrix models , @xmath79 is the variance of the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) . in model",
    "i , @xmath79 is proportional to @xmath60 , eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) , in a manner that will be discussed shortly .",
    "note that thanks to the banks - casher relationship  @xcite , @xmath79 is in all cases to be identified with the chiral order parameter : @xmath80 having obtained the semicircle distribution in model i is a natural result .",
    "the random matrix interactions of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) mix a set of @xmath81 independent real matrices , @xmath53 , in a democratic way .",

    "@xmath79 does not depend on @xmath82 , and hence does not depend on @xmath37 . in model",
    "i , however , @xmath79 is a function of @xmath37 and @xmath60 which can be easily determined by noting the following relationship  , and by matching its asymptotic expansion at large @xmath83 to the form it assumes for the spectral density of eq .",

    "( [ w ] ) , and the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) , we have @xmath86\\rangle = 4 \\sum_{\\mu a }   \\langle { \\rm tr } [ a_{\\mu a } ( a_{\\mu a})^t ] \\rangle = \\frac{2 ( n_c^2 - 1)}{n_c^2}\\,\\frac{n}{\\sigma_0 ^ 2 } , \\label{sigmasquared}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath87 the @xmath37 dependence of the chiral condensate reflects the fact that the strength of the interactions in the chiral channel varies with @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath37-dependent prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ sigmasquared ] ) is directly proportional to the fierz coefficient which appears when the random matrix interactions are projected onto the chiral condensation channel ( ref .",
    "the structures that are characteristic of chiral symmetry are most clearly seen in the distributions of the eigenvalues near zero virtuality .",
    "it is thus worth considering the microscopic spectral density , defined at the level of single eigenvalues as @xmath88 where @xmath79 is the chiral order parameter of the theory at hand .",
    "the microscopic spectral densities of the various chiral ensembles are strikingly different . in the quenched limit",
    ", @xmath2gue gives @xmath89 while @xmath2goe gives  @xcite @xmath90    figures  1 and 2 show the histograms obtained in the models of refs .",
    "@xcite , plotted against eq .",
    "( [ rhocgue ] ) for the model with @xmath5 and against eq .",
    "( [ rhocgoe ] ) for that with @xmath13 .",
    "the data were obtained from an ensemble of @xmath91 matrices with blocks @xmath29 of size @xmath92 ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) . as in @xmath2rmt ,",
    "the behavior of the small eigenvalues depends strongly on whether @xmath5 or @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the data agree with the theoretical curves for the corresponding chiral ensembles to expected statistical accuracy .",
    "the microscopic spectral density thus appears to preserve the form dictated by chiral symmetry in spite of the presence of additional color symmetries . in particular",
    ", we observe the familiar depletion near @xmath94 for @xmath69 .    the spectrum in fig .",
    "2 is flatter than that for @xmath5 .",
    "this is a consequence of the greater motion of the individual eigenvalues in the model with @xmath13 .",
    "this difference is familiar in chiral ensembles , where it is interpreted as a consequence of the fact that the spectrum of a real matrix ( @xmath2goe ) is less rigid than that of a complex matrix ( @xmath2gue ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the level motion in our model with @xmath13 agrees with that expected for @xmath2goe even though the matrix elements of @xmath29 are no longer real .",
    "again , the correlations induced by chiral symmetry are maintained in spite of the additional constraints introduced by the color structure of @xmath29 .    of course , the preservation of the @xmath13 microscopic spectral density in spite of the complexity of @xmath29 should not come as a surprise . the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ zcolor ] ) are , in fact , pseudoreal when @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "thus , we could have used an appropriate basis of states such that all matrix elements have vanishing imaginary parts .",
    "the model would then have displayed a greater similarity to a @xmath2rmt model with @xmath95 , and it would thus be natural to find a spectrum which reproduces that of @xmath2goe .",
    "we have also studied short range eigenvalue correlations by examining the distribution of level spacings , @xmath96 . here , @xmath97 is the nearest neighbor spacing measured in units of the local average spacing .",
    "( hence , the average value of @xmath97 is @xmath41 by definition . )",
    "note that @xmath96 is a bulk observable which is sensitive to chiral symmetry only for small @xmath97 .",
    "figure 3 shows the relative difference between the results obtained for the model of i with @xmath5 and those of the @xmath2gue .",
    "the data were obtained from a set of nine independent series of diagonalizations of 10000 matrices of size @xmath98 . to avoid side effects due to the finite range of the random matrix support",
    ", we only kept a central portion of the spectrum ( 30th eigenvalue to 90th ) .",
    "the level spacing distribution for a given model is taken as a bin - by - bin average over the nine series of runs , with error bars corresponding to the variance in each bin .",
    "the plot shows @xmath99/p_{\\chi{\\rm gue}}(s)$ ] , where @xmath100 is the level spacing distribution for @xmath101 and @xmath102 is that for model i with @xmath5 .",
    "[ note that @xmath103 . ]",
    "the level spacing difference is everywhere consistent with zero .",
    "similar results were obtained for a comparison with @xmath2goe .",
    "thus , the level spacing distribution reveals no statistically significant differences between the models of refs .",
    "@xcite and their corresponding chiral ensembles .",
    "it is also useful to construct the variance - covariance matrix @xmath104 , defined as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the mean value of eigenvalue @xmath107 .",
    "numerical studies of the models of refs .",
    "@xcite indicate that all eigenvalues of @xmath104 are greater than zero .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues of the dirac operator do not satisfy any linear constraints .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath104 are related to the statistically independent fluctuations of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator about their mean values .",
    "( this relation would be exact if the joint probability distribution for the eigenvalues of the dirac operator were strictly gaussian . )",
    "numerical studies reveal good agreement with the spectrum of normal modes known analytically for the @xmath2goe and @xmath2gue  @xcite .",
    "this provides an additional indication that the inclusion of color symmetry has not altered the statistical properties of the models of refs .",
    "@xcite from those of the corresponding chiral ensembles .",
    "we have investigated a number of properties of the eigenvalue spectrum of random matrix models which include both chiral and color symmetries .",
    "we find no deviation from the analytic results of @xmath2rmt for either the microscopic spectral density or the level spacing distribution . given the relatively elaborate block structure of these models , such studies are most easily performed numerically . while more complicated spectral correlators have not been investigated , we find no grounds to doubt that they will also reflect the underlying chiral structure of the problem .",
    "( it should be emphasized that this extended block structure does not lead to complicated forms for the partition function and that studies of the macroscopic properties of these models are straightforward for all @xmath3 and @xmath4 . )",
    "the spin and color block structures of the interactions do not seem to upset spectral features associated with chiral symmetry .",
    "rather , these additional correlations appear to act in a channel which is `` orthogonal '' to the chiral channel .",
    "we do not regard this result as surprising .",
    "one may think of the models of refs .",
    "@xcite as schematic lattice calculations which implement single - gluon exchange between discrete quark fields .",
    "this `` lattice calculation '' does not possess any other length scale than that introduced by @xmath79 and is , hence , free of a thouless energy . because chiral symmetry is respected by the interactions ,",
    "the results of @xmath2rmt should be anticipated at all small energies .",
    "this is indeed what our numerical analysis reveals .",
    "the inclusion of color does , of course , introduce additional correlations in the spectrum of the dirac operator .",
    "it would be of interest to construct new spectral measures which could probe these correlations .",
    "in particular , it would be valuable to find a color analogue of the banks - casher relation to facilitate the determination of the strength of the diquark condensate .",
