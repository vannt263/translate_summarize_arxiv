    "one of the most important concepts in the many ",
    "body theory of finite fermi systems is the mean field approach .",
    "in fact , many phenomena observed in nuclei can be explained by means of a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism which leads to a mean field solution that does not obey symmetries of the original many ",
    "body hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "a nucleus with a partially filled highest shell spontaneously deforms in such a way that a lower energy minimum is achieved , and thus a non  spherical equilibrium shape is attained .",
    "coriolis forces may cause a similar effect for a nucleus which has a spherical shape in a ground state .",
    "in particular , a strong coupling of normal and intruder states near the fermi surface at large rotational frequencies can lead to a superdeformed or to an octupole deformed shape for certain combinations of protons and neutrons @xcite .",
    "the most practical method for the analysis of nuclear shapes is a phenomenological macroscopic  microscopic method ( mmm ) which combines the liquid drop model describing the bulk properties of nuclear matter and the strutinsky shell correction method providing the description of quantum shell effects of phenomenological potentials @xcite .",
    "the more fundamental approach is based on self  consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations once a particular choice of nucleon - nucleon interaction has been made .",
    "a commonly used inter - nucleon force is that of skyrme . while the hf+skyrme approach describes major features of nuclei quite well , it does not completely take into account the pairing correlations .",
    "in addition , various sets of parameters for skyrme forces may not provide a definite answer in some cases . the hartree - fock - bogoluibov ( hfb ) method with the gogny forces resolves these problems quite effectively .",
    "furthermore , it has the same prediction power as the mmm @xcite .    in recent years",
    "a lot of experimental and theoretical efforts has been devoted to the analysis of superdeformed ( sd ) bands in different mass region @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of octupole degrees of freedom is also a topical subject in the nuclear structure physics @xcite .",
    "it turns out that octupole deformations are significant for superdeformed nuclei as well as for normal - deformed ( nd ) nuclei .",
    "most of these studies were restricted to the axial octupole deformation proportional to the @xmath3 term in the octupole family .",
    "the reason for this is primarily computational complications arising as a result of the extra degree of freedom introduced by non - axial octupole deformations .",
    "however , during the last few years some remarkable results have been reported .",
    "it was found that @xmath2 and @xmath4 components resulted in the lowest energy octupole vibrations for oblate and prolate superdeformed shapes and therefore may have consequences for octupole instability @xcite .",
    "calculations using the mmm with the woods ",
    "saxon potential predicted the importance of the banana - type @xmath2 deformation for highly deformed nuclei @xcite , while the @xmath4 deformation has been found to be important in the @xmath5 nucleus @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent hf+skyrme calculations @xcite suggest the softness of the oblate states in @xmath6 nuclei against the @xmath7 deformation in the ground states . the self - consistent cranking hf+skyrme",
    "approach @xcite predicts that the @xmath2 deformation is important for a correct description of the yrast band of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the study of octupole deformations sheds light on the interplay between a classical chaos and a quantum spectrum of finite fermi systems @xcite .",
    "guided by thorough investigation of non - axial octupole deformations in a harmonic oscillator model @xcite , we aim to analyze how symmetries break at high spins in the cranking hfb approach with the gogny interaction . in accordance with",
    "the octupole instability suggested at particle number @xmath816 and 28 @xcite , we choose two @xmath9 nuclei , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in sec.[sec : hfb ] we review the main features of our model .",
    "the discussion of main results is presented in sec.[sec : num ] with the conclusion following in sec.4 . in the appendix",
    "we introduce a simple two - level model to understand qualitatively the behavior of the inglis - beliaev moment of inertia due to strong octupole coupling between two single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "as mentioned above , the present self - consistent cranking hfb calculation has been performed with the effective gogny d1s interaction @xcite .",
    "this interaction provides a good description of many nuclear properties over the nuclide chart , e.g. , ground state energies , odd - even energy differences , electron scattering data @xcite , fission barriers @xcite .",
    "also , a good description is obtained for bulk properties of rotating nuclei in actinide region @xcite , mercury region @xcite and fp - shell region @xcite .",
    "our numerical code has been used for the analysis of microscopic dynamics in light rotating nuclei @xcite . in these calculations , however , the signature symmetry was conserved ( see discussion about different symmetries in rotating nuclei in @xcite ) .",
    "the present calculations are performed without assuming _  priori _ the axial and signature symmetries .",
    "in addition , our hamiltonian includes the coulomb interaction and the center of mass correction up to the exchange terms exactly .",
    "the @xmath10-axis is taken as a rotational axis in our code . to save the cpu time in numerical calculations , we impose the @xmath11 ( @xmath10-simplex ) and the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) symmetries @xcite , where @xmath14 is the parity operator ,",
    "@xmath15 is the rotation operator around the @xmath16-axis ( i = y , z ) on angle @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the time - reversal operator . due to the @xmath10-simplex and @xmath13 symmetries , the mass asymmetry of nucleus is allowed only along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "thus , we solve numerically the following cranking hfb equations :    @xmath20    where the lagrange multipliers @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the chemical potentials of proton and neutron fields , respectively ( the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 are protons and neutrons number operators ) ; the lagrange multiplier @xmath25 is the angular frequency of a collective rotation around the @xmath10-axis and @xmath26 is the @xmath10-component of the angular momentum operator @xmath27 . to keep the center of mass motion fixed",
    ", we also impose the quadrupole constraint operator @xmath28 @xcite to the routhian @xmath29 in the @xmath19-axis direction .",
    "the quasi - particle ( q.p . ) operators @xmath30 where the state @xmath31 is a single - particle basis state ( see below ) , obey the equation of motion @xmath32= \\epsilon_i(\\omega ) { \\hat{\\alpha}^\\dagger }",

    "we define the @xmath36-axis as the quantization axis of deformation for convenience .",
    "consequently , the quadrupole , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and octupole , @xmath39 , deformation parameters are defined as @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 are spherical coordinates related to the cartesian coordinates in the rotating frame @xmath43 as @xmath44 all deformations proportional to the odd power of the @xmath36 coordinate are forbidden in our code due to the @xmath13 symmetry . since @xmath45 and @xmath46 are proportional to the odd @xmath47 terms , we use @xmath48 and @xmath49 to represent the degree of the non - axial octupole deformation , when the @xmath36-axis is the largest axis of a prolate nucleus .",
    "notice that the octupole deformation with a mass asymmetry like a pear shape is also represented by the combination of @xmath48 and @xmath49 when the @xmath19-axis is the largest axis of a prolate nucleus . and",

    "wave functions have been expanded in a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator basis up to the principal quantum number @xmath51 for @xmath0 and up to @xmath52 for @xmath1 .",
    "the basis has been symmetrized with respect to the @xmath10-simplex operation , and eigenfunctions are eigenstates of the @xmath13 operator ( the goodman basis @xcite ) .",
    "since the ground state shapes of the chosen nuclei are a normal - deformed one for @xmath0 and a spherical one for @xmath1 , we use a spherical cartesian basis with the same range parameters of the hermite polynomials for all axes .",
    "the range parameters have been optimized to reproduce the largest binding energy of each ground state .    to understand the relation between s.p .",
    "degrees of freedom and collective effects due to the rotation , we calculate three moments of inertia , the static moment of inertia @xmath53 , the dynamical moment of inertia @xmath54 , and the inglis - beliaev ( ib ) moment of inertia @xmath55 which is the leading order term of the nuclear moment of inertia . here",
    "@xmath56 is a matrix element of the angular momentum operator @xmath26 @xmath57{|\\phi{\\mbox{\\footnotesize $ ( \\omega)$}}{\\rangle}}.\\ ] ] it is well known @xcite that the ib moment of inertia is too small to reproduce the absolute value of the moment of inertia .",
    "comparing @xmath58 and @xmath59 or @xmath60 , we can find the validity of using the @xmath58 for the analysis of structural changes in the nuclear mean field .",
    "in addition , we analyze different contributions to the ib moment of inertia , eq.([thmoi ] ) , @xmath61 where @xmath62 denote the isospin @xmath63 and the @xmath10-simplex quantum number @xmath64 which characterize different subspaces .",
    "the comparison of different components of @xmath58 could provide the information in which subspace the q.p .",
    "degrees of freedom mainly affect the bulk properties of the nuclei .",

    "in figs.1 - 3 results for the yrast line states , angular momenta and deformations as functions of the rotational frequency are presented .",
    "the binding energy of the ground state in @xmath0 is well reproduced in our calculations ( fig.[fig : enes ] ) .",
    "we found that the contribution from the pairing interaction terms to the total binding energy is almost negligible .",
    "the energy gaps between q.p .",
    "energies near the fermi energies are large , about 4 mev , both in the proton and neutron fields .",
    "therefore , the calculations for the nd and sd bands have been done using the cranking hf approximation with the same parameter set as for the hfb calculations .",
    "while there are differences in details between our calculations and those with skyrme forces @xcite , we obtained similar main results for the nd and sd bands .",
    "the sd band becomes the yrast one for @xmath67 .",
    "the excitation energy of the sd minimum relative to the ground state is about 10 mev ( fig .",

    "however , finite values of the non - axial octupole deformation @xmath2 in the nd yrast band are obtained at larger rotational frequency @xmath71 [ mev/ @xmath72 . as is seen in fig.[fig : octs](a ) , the value of the non - axial octupole deformation @xmath73 increases suddenly at @xmath74 [ mev/ @xmath72 , where the pseudo level - crossing occurs between s.p .",

    "the density distribution projected on the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis is shown on fig.[fig : dens](a ) for the octupole band at @xmath79 [ mev@xmath81 where the @xmath48 deformation has a maximal value .",
    "high resolution @xmath82 spectroscopy could test the validity of different predictions based on different nuclear interactions .    from the analysis of figs.[fig : octs](a ) , [ fig : mois](a ) it follows that there is a correlation between the behavior of the dynamical moment of inertia @xmath60 and the occurrence of the octupole deformation . similar to the behavior of the @xmath73 , the dynamical moment of inertia @xmath60 begins to increase at @xmath83 [ mev/@xmath72 , and both quantities show local maxima around @xmath84 [ mev/@xmath72 . due to the strong octupole interaction the quasi - crossing between s.p .",

    "from fig.[fig : jinp](a ) follows that the magnitudes of @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see eq.([jingp1 ] ) ) are smaller than those from the @xmath87 subspaces which play the dominant roles in the collective rotation at low spins , in the region @xmath88[mev/@xmath72 .",

    "the contribution of the ground state octupole correlations may improve the mean field results .",
    "this contribution could be estimated , for example , in the random phase approximation like @xcite according to the prescription @xcite , however , this is beyond the scope of the present paper .    as is seen in fig.[fig : mois](a ) , both moments of inertia , @xmath60 and @xmath58 , begin to increase again at @xmath107 [ mev@xmath81 , which is apparently due to the quasi - crossings in the @xmath87 subspaces at this point .",

    "the yrast non - rotating states observed in @xmath1 are related to vibrational excitations .",
    "in fact , their properties can be studied within the self - consistent cranking approach with the rotation _ around a symmetry axis _ @xcite and we will discuss this subject in a forthcoming paper . the calculations for the ground state , nd and sd bands have been done in a similar manner to those of @xmath0 in the hf approximation , since the contribution of the pairing interaction terms to the total binding energies are almost negligible .",
    "on fig.[fig : oms ] the evolution of the angular momentum with the increase of the rotational frequency is shown for sd and nd bands . at low spins",
    "the sd minimum is formed by the 4@xmath112 - 4@xmath113 configuration with respect to the ground state in @xmath1 , @xmath114\\nu[(3)^{-2}(4)^ { 2}]$ ] , which has a prolate shape with the quadrupole deformation @xmath115 ( fig.[fig : betas ] ) .",

    "the mmm calculations @xcite also predict the sd shape at large rotational frequencies .",
    "we restricted , however , our analysis of the sd band in the region of @xmath119[mev/@xmath72 , since at larger rotational frequencies the contribution of higher shells @xmath120 becomes important .",
    "using the decomposition of the rational harmonic oscillator ( rho ) into the isotropic ones , the relation between multi - clusters and mean field results has been discussed in @xcite . for sd shapes in the rho the one symmetric and one asymmetric combinations of spherical oscillators",
    "are expected ( see also @xcite ) . within the rho",
    "the sd states in @xmath1 correspond to the asymmetric combination of two spherical oscillators with magic numbers @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the density distribution of the sd state ( see fig.[fig : sddni ] ) does not show such a multi - cluster structure at @xmath78 [ mev/@xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the possible reason is that our configuration space is too small .",
    "however , the sd minimum could be related to the resonance state in the @xmath124si+@xmath124si collision at high excitation energy @xmath125mev and high angular momenta @xmath126 reported in @xcite .",
    "a thorough study of @xmath1 as well as @xmath0 at high spins may help to understand the link between the tendency for nuclei to create strongly deformed shapes and the tendency to develop the cluster structure .",
