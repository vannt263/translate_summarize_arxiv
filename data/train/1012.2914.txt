    "the subject of the fluctuation - induced transport was motivated by the challenge to explain unidirectional transport in biological systems@xcite , as well as their potential technological applications ranging from classical non - equilibrium models@xcite to quantum systems@xcite .",
    "ratchets have been proposed to model the unidirectional motion driven by zero - mean non - equilibrium fluctuations . broadly speaking , ratchet devices fall into three categories depending on how the applied perturbation couples to the substrate asymmetry : rocking ratchets@xcite",

    "additionally , entropic ratchets , in which brownian particles move in a confined structure , instead of a potential , were also extensively studied @xcite . +",
    "anomalous diffusion has attracted growing attention , being observed in various fields of physics and related sciences @xcite , where by contrast with brownian motion , long - range temporal correlations induce nonstandard dynamical behaviors .",
    "the diffusion is characterized through the power law form of the mean - square displacement @xmath0 . according to the value of the index @xmath1 , one can distinguish subdiffusion ( @xmath2 ) , normal diffusion ( @xmath3 ) and superdiffusion ( @xmath4 ) . in the literature ,",
    "two popular stochastic models have been used to account for anomalous diffusion .",
    "the first model is the continuous - time random walk @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the subdiffusion is caused by the long waiting time between successive jumps and the superdiffusion is induced by the long jumps . in the minimal lvy ratchet@xcite , the heavy - tailed distribution of the @xmath1-stable noise can break the thermodynamical equilibrium and induce directed transport .",
    "+ the second model is fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) introduced by mandelbrot and van ness @xcite .",
    "fbm has wide applications in some complex systems , such as monomer diffusion in a polymer chain @xcite , diffusion of biopolymers in the crowded environment @xcite , single file diffusion @xcite , and translocation of the polymer passing through a pore @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of fbm are characterized by the hurst exponent @xmath5 . in particular , its meansquared displacement satisfies @xmath6 , thus for @xmath7 one can obtain the subdiffusive dynamics , whereas for @xmath8 the superdiffusive one @xcite . in the last few years , there has been a growing interest in the study of the fbm @xcite .",
    "however , most studies of fbm focus on the free fbm and a few studies on fbm have been involved the potentials .",
    "recently , sliusarenko and coworkers @xcite studied the escape from a potential well driven by fractional gaussian noises and found that the escape becomes faster for decreasing values of hurst exponent .",
    "chaudhury and cherayila @xcite studied the first passage time distribution for barrier crossing in a double well under fractional gaussian noises .",
    "it is uncertain whether fractional gaussian noise can induce directed transport in the absence of any external driving forces . in order to answer this question , we studied the transport of overdamped brownian particles driven by fractional gaussian noises in asymmetrically periodic potentials .",
    "we focus on finding the rectified mechanism and how noise intensity and hurst exponent affect the transport .",
    "in this study , we consider the directed transport of the brownian particles driven by fractional gaussian noises in the absence of whatever additional time - dependent forces .",
    "the overdamped dynamics can be described by the following langevin equation in the dimensionless form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fractional gaussian noise , @xmath11 is noise intensity , and @xmath12 is the hurst exponent .",

    "fractional gaussian noise is a zero mean stationary random process with long memory effects @xcite .",

    "though fbm is an old topic , the consistent analytical methods are still not available . here",
    "we will study the transport of the brownian particles by using langevin dynamics simulations . from eqs .",

    "persistent fractional gaussian noise can be artificially divided into two frequency components : white gaussian noise and low frequency ac drive .",
    "similarly , the anti - persistent fractional gaussian noise in frequency domain is equivalent to a compound of white gaussian noise and high frequency drive .     as a function of the asymmetric parameter @xmath20 of the potential for both persistent and anti - persistent cases at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "because of @xmath73 , @xmath71 is always less than @xmath72 .",
    "firstly , the particles stay in the minima of the potential ( see fig .",
    "4 ( b ) ) until they are catapulted out of the well by a large amplitude fluctuation . for the persistent case ( @xmath57 )",
    ", the fractional gaussian noise contains more low frequency components ( see the upper of the fig .",
    "3 ) and it can be divided into two parts : white gaussian noise and low frequency ac drive . due to the low frequency , the drive has a very long period and @xmath74 .",
    "all particles get enough time to cross both sides from the minima of the potential before the drive reverses its direction .",
    "however , the left side is steeper than the right one , more particles climb the barrier from the right side , so the average velocity is positive . for the anti - persistent case(@xmath56 ) , the high frequency components dominate over the low frequency ones(see the bottom of the fig .",
    "3 ) . in this case , the drive has a short period and @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) . in a short driving period ,",
    "the particles have sufficient time to diffuse across the steeper side of the well , resulting in negative average velocity .",
    "it should be pointed out that the average velocity will tend to zero for the case of @xmath77 ( very small values of @xmath12 ) which is also shown in fig . 6 .     as a function of noise intensity @xmath43 for different values of hurst exponent @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath55 , and @xmath81 at @xmath46 and @xmath60 .",

    "when @xmath83 so that the noise is very large , the effect of the potential disappears and the average velocity tends to zero , also .",

    "for the persistent case ( @xmath84 ) , the average velocity increases monotonically with the hurst exponent .",

    "when @xmath87 , the fractional gaussian noise reduces to the white gaussian noise , the system undergoes thermal equilibrium and the average velocity tends to zero .",

    "similar to the classic ratchets @xcite , there exists a value of noise intensity at which the average velocity takes its extremal value .",
    "the average velocity as a function of the asymmetry of the potential is monotonic . from the numerical analysis of the spectral density of fractional gaussian noises",

    "+ directed transport in static ratchet potentials can also be induced by the other types of noise , such as @xmath1-stable noise ( lvy ratchet)@xcite , white shot noise ( shot - noise ratchet)@xcite , and two correlated noises ( correlated ratchet)@xcite . in the lvy ratchet @xcite , the thermodynamical equilibrium is broken by the the heavy - tailed distribution of the @xmath1-stable noise . for shot - noise ratchet @xcite , the temporal asymmetry of white shot noise can induce an effective , inhomogeneous diffusion , so the net current occurs . in the correlated ratchet @xcite , fluctuation - induced transport is driven by both additive gaussian white noise and additive colored noise .",
    "the additive colored noise can be treated as the multiplicative noise by introducing a new auxiliary variable , therefore an effective , inhomogeneous diffusion appears . however , in our fractional gaussian noise - induced ratchet , the directed transport is induced by the asymmetry of noise spectral density .",
