    "current constructing and upgrading ground - based gravitational wave detectors may reach the strain sensitivity in order of @xmath0}$ ] in near future .",
    "these detector sites are dislocated , and make possible to have a independent observation of gravitational waves . since the dislocated detectors may not have a correlation in noise component but have a correlation in gravitational waveforms , cross - correlation product by two or more detectors make possible to search for unknown gravitational waveforms .",
    "this is useful property in burst gravitational wave search for short duration , or in stochastic gravitational wave search for long duration .",
    "distance between detectors also make possible triangulation for signal measurement .",
    "time delay between detectors suggest the incident direction of the gravitational wave .",
    "it is used in short duration signal analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "an employment of the time delay term in long duration signal search or stochastic gravitational wave which come from any directions is not simple .",
    "however , we can extract the signal strength if we resolve earth s rotation and convoluted signal from anywhere in the sky .",
    "using multiple detectors and long time integration , the deconvolution will be possible .",
    "the directional cross - correlation search for gravitational wave is proposed as radiometry.    radiometry and any other triangulation analysis require long distance among detectors , and variation of arrangement ( zenith direction , and azimuthal rotation of interferometers ) make possible to cover the sky and resolve the polarization .",
    "recent starting of the construction of lcgt@xcite in addition to previously constructed advanced detector sites of ligo@xcite and virgo@xcite encourage the development of radiometry analysis .",
    "gravitational wave radiometry is a kind of stochastic gravitational wave search , but it is a directional analysis .",
    "radiometry analysis assumes that gravitational wave come from particular direction as a point like source or a hot spot of sky .",
    "the radiometry filter uses at least two detector observation data , and do not require the waveform .",
    "gravitational wave coming from particular direction will have a time delay of arrival at two detectors shown in fig.[fig : ideaoverview ] .",
    "since gravitational wave signals on both detectors are coherent in same polarization component , we can extract gravitational wave signals in the cross - correlation product from two detectors observation data with appropriate time delay .",
    "moreover , signal - to - noise ratio for gravitational wave will be emphasized with long integration time , because the two detector noises are independent .",
    "changing the assumption of source direction step by step , we can search gravitational wave ` sky map ' by radiometry analysis .",
    "radiometry analysis is given and studied in previous works@xcite@xcite .",
    "we explain the radiometry filter briefly here .",
    "the source direction or particular direction of search can be represent as unit vector @xmath1 .",
    "two detectors are noted as 1 and 2 , and a base - line from detector 1 to detector 2 can be given as vector @xmath2 .",
    "an arrival time delay for gravitational wave between two detectors is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a speed of light .",
    "detector output from each detector @xmath5 in time domain have same gravitational wave timing . in fourier domain ,",
    "this time delay represent as a phase difference of two detectors output @xmath6 in fourier transform of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we can define the radiometry filter as following .",
    "a directed overlap reduction function @xmath9 can be defined to correct phase difference as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are antenna pattern@xcite of each detector 1 or 2 for each two polarization @xmath12 or @xmath13 of gravitational wave . to make optimal filtering , we employ two detectors noise power spectrum @xmath14 respectively , and assume that gravitational wave spectrum as @xmath15 .",
    "radiometry filter can defined as @xmath16 and filter output is @xmath17    the base - line @xmath2 will change relatively in celestial coordinate according to earth s rotation in the case of ground - based detectors .",
    "therefore , we calculate @xmath18 at short time slice ( ` chunk ' ) during @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "fourier transforms of detector signals can be represented using short fourier transform of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 can be denoted as @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24    processing many chunks for long duration observation data , we can get the statistics of @xmath18 .",
    "since the gravitational wave component will appear in real part of @xmath18 , we employ a mean @xmath25 @xmath26\\rangle\\ , \\label{eq : mu}\\ ] ] and a standard deviation @xmath27 for a real part of @xmath18 .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio of particular direction can be given as @xmath28",
    "radiometry analysis might find a hot spot in sky map .",
    "hot spot may be formed by concentration of unresolved huge number of astronomical sources . here is one of the promising targets the virgo cluster which could contain @xmath29 neutron stars .",
    "our results show that sufficient signal to noise can be accumulated with integration times of the order of a year .",
    "we published this study in the reference @xcite .",
    "if an average ellipticity of neutron stars are @xmath30 , virgo cluster might be appear as a hot spot with observation of order of year , using 2nd generation ground - based detectors .",
    "the numerical estimation of expected gw spectrum and signal - to - noise ratio of virgo cluster hot spot is explained in this reference in detail .",
    "here we remark the average detector response for the sky . in eq.([eq : gamma ] ) , magnitude of two detector s combined detector response @xmath31 is give as @xmath32    since @xmath31 will change according to earth s rotation , we have to use average during one day : @xmath33 @xmath34 will not depend on a right ascension .",

    "to confirme the behavior of a hot spot in the radiometry sky map , we construct numerical test of radiometry filter .",

    "3 ) generate gravitational wave signal : : :    gravitational wave signal at source is generated .",
    "we tested with    sinusoidal wave , and random phase waveform which has power spectrum in    certain frequency band , e.g. flat power spectrum in    300@xmath3730 hz .",
    "4 ) inject gravitational wave signal into detector noises in time domain : : :       +    gravitational wave signal will incident detectors with doppler effect ,    antenna patterns and time delay between two detectors .",
    "doppler effect    is employed as a frequency modulus of gravitational wave on the    detector according to the orbital motion and earth s rotation . for    incident direction on detectors , antenna patterns    @xmath38",
    "are calculated for the signal .",
    "also    the arrival time difference of the signal on two ( or more ) detectors    are given in this step .",
    "these condition will change as time goes by    according to earth s rotation .",

    "how spread the point source on the sky is important to evaluate the feasibility of searches .",

    "point spread function'_. point spread function depends on gravitational wave frequency or spectrum , a position on the sky ( right ascension , celestial declination ) , and for detector orientation on the earth . in point spread function study in this subsection , we used noiseless detector output , but other filter setting is same to explanation above",

    "we can find of wide and multiple spreading image from the injection of point source , since the different time lag makes aliases .",
    "spatial interval is wide for low frequency band , and narrow for higher frequency band .",
