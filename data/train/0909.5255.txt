    "<S> hence proposed illusion device could be realized by artificial metamaterials .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.0 mm    pacs numbers . 41.20.jb , 42.25.gy , 42.79.-e    in the past few years </S>",
    "<S> , great attention has been paid to the transformation optics [ 1 - 21 ] . among the various optical transformation devices , </S>",
    "<S> the most exciting and fascinating one is the invisibility cloak [ 1 - 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the first free - space cloak with simplified medium parameters was verified experimentally at the microwave frequency [ 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a carpet cloak has been proposed [ 4 ] and confirmed in microwave frequencies [ 5 ] and then in optical frequencies [ 6,7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by these pioneering work , other applications such as the rotation of electromagnetic ( em ) waves [ 10,11 ] , and omnidirectional retroreflectors [ 12,13 ] have been proposed and investigated .    more recently , lai _ et _ al . </S>",
    "<S> have proposed an interesting idea of illusion optics , which makes a target with arbitrary shape and material properties look like another object of some other shape and material makeup [ 19 ] . </S>",
    "<S> some special illusion devices have been discussed before this , such as the super absorber [ 13 ] , the superscatterer [ 16 ] , the shifted - position cloak [ 18 ] , and the cylindrical superlens [ 21 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , all above - mentioned illusion devices are composed of the left - handed materials with simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability . </S>",
    "<S> hence such illusion devices are highly demanding on the material properties , and the applications are possible to be limited to the realm of theory .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a composite optical transformation to design an illusion device which makes the enclosed actual object located at one place appear to be at another place . </S>",
    "<S> such an illusion device shows unconventional em properties as verified by accurately numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we try to make the illusion device be fairly realizable . unlike the published illusion devices which are composed of left - handed materials [ 13 , 16 - 19 , 21 ] , all permittivity and permeability components of the proposed illusion device are positive . </S>",
    "<S> hence the presented method makes it possible to realize the illusion device by using the modern metamaterials .    </S>",
    "<S> a concise schematic to design the proposed illusion device is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a car at position @xmath0 is enclosed with an illusion device , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an illusion device make any detector outside the virtual boundary ( surface @xmath1 ) observe the em fields of a virtual car at position @xmath2 ( shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) instead of the actual one . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the illusion device makes the em - field distributions outside the virtual boundary in both the virtual and physical spaces exactly the same , regardless the direction from which the em waves are incident . </S>",
    "<S> the composite coordinate transformation of the illusion device contains two sub - mappings . </S>",
    "<S> first , we map the first virtual space ( the free space outside the car in the virtual space in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) into a smaller annulus region ( the light green region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . second , we transform the second virtual space ( light green region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) into the physical space ( dark green region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability tensors of the illusion device are calculated by @xmath3 in which @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the permittivity and permeability tensors in the first virtual space ( illusion space ) and the physical space , respectively , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the jacobian transformation matrices with components @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponding to the mapping from the first virtual space to the second virtual space , and the mapping from the second virtual space to the physical space , respectively .    similar to other optical transformation devices , the em fields in the illusion device can be obtained from the transformation optics [ 1,2 ] as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are electric and magnetic fields in the first virtual space , respectively . because the virtual boundary @xmath1 is mapped to itself during these two sub - mappings @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the subscript @xmath18 indicates the transverse components along the surface @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the tangential components of the em fields on the whole virtual boundary ( @xmath1 ) are exactly the same in both physical and virtual spaces . hence the em fields outside the illusion device are also exactly the same by using the uniqueness theorem . any observers outside the illusion device will perceive the scattered fields as if they were scattered from a car at position @xmath2 .    for a specific example </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an illusion device which can move the image of a metallic cylinder from one place to another place . </S>",
    "<S> to design such an illusion device , we construct a composite transformation which contains two sub - mappings in the cartesian coordinate system , the first sub - mapping can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the centers of virtual and actual metallic cylinders and circular virtual region , respectively , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> such a sub - mapping describes a similar transformation that maps the blank region in the virtual space in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) into the light green region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second sub - mapping can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 ) , and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this sub - mapping describes a similar transformation that maps the light green region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) into the dark green region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the converse transformation of the virtual variables and the physical variables can be constructed by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2)-(7 ) </S>",
    "<S> . then the constitutive parameters of the illusion device can be calculated by formulae ( 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the em parameters of the illusion device can also be obtained by another process for such a composite transformation . a function relationship between @xmath32 and @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> can be found from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2)-(7 ) as follows , @xmath34 based on the above composite transformation , the permittivity and permeability of the illusion device are expressed as @xmath35 where we denote the partial derivative of the function @xmath36 to @xmath37 as @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that the background profile be free space , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    obviously , these two sub - mappings are not conformal transformations , hence some non - diagonal components of the permittivity and permeability tensors are non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> but in the real fabrications , it is necessary that the material parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 are denoted in diagonal tensors . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the real tensors @xmath41 and @xmath42 ensure that a rotation transformation which maps a symmetric tensor into a diagonal one always exists . </S>",
    "<S> when a transverse - electric ( te ) polarized plane wave is incident upon an enclosed metallic cylinder with infinite length , there exists only @xmath43 component of electric field , hence only @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are of interest and must satisfy the request of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 11)-(16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the em parameters in the eigen - basis can be expressed as @xmath48 and all the off - diagonal components equal zero . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , all components @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are finite and positive . </S>",
    "<S> also , @xmath50 is always greater than @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> unlike the earlier - proposed shifted - position cloak which consists of left - handed materials with double negative constitutive parameters [ 18 ] , the illusion device here is only composed of one layer of inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium . in order to verify the design of the illusion device </S>",
    "<S> , we make accurately numerical simulations using the software package , comsol multiphysics , which is based on the finite - element method . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an illusion device which moves a metallic cylinder from one place virtually to another place . in this example </S>",
    "<S> , we choose @xmath52 m , @xmath53 m , @xmath54 m , @xmath55=0.13 m , and @xmath56 m.    under the illumination of te - polarized waves , only @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of principle components @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are illustrated in figure 2 , from which we clearly observe that all values are finite and positive . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to note that these two sub - mappings in this illusion device are compressing and extending mappings , respectively , instead of the folding of geometry [ 17 - 21 ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence any material parameters of the illusion device are not negative . </S>",
    "<S> similar metamaterial structures have been extensively investigated and fabricated in the experiment of free - space cloaks and other devices at microwave frequencies [ 3,11 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 illustrates the numerical results of total electric fields for the above illusion device . </S>",
    "<S> the plane waves are incident vertically from the bottom to the top at 6 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3(a ) and 3(c ) show the total - field distributions of the metallic cylinder located at different places . when the metallic cylinder enclosed by the shifted - position illusion device , the scattered pattern from the metallic cylinder will be changed as if the metallic cylinder was at another place . </S>",
    "<S> this can be clearly observed by comparing the scattered patterns of the metallic cylinder coated by the illusion device shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) and the metallic cylinder shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) . inside the virtual boundary , the em - field distributions in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) and 3(c ) are very different . </S>",
    "<S> but the total - field distributions are exactly the same outside the virtual boundary . </S>",
    "<S> a position - moving illusion has been generated .    in summary , we have presented a composite optical transformation to design a kind of illusion device , which can move the target from one place to another place virtually by using metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> in such an illusion device , all diagonal components of constitutive tensors are positive and all off - diagonal ones are zero , hence the illusion device could be realized using artificial metamaterial structures .    </S>",
