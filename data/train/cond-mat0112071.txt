    "the theory of quasi - one - dimensional conductors has shown that there are dimension - specific aspects not observed in conventional three - dimensional solids . aside from the interaction dependent power law behavior of single - particle and pair response functions and the well documented spin - charge separation , there is the renormalization of the transverse hopping whose impact on the description of real materials is much debated . as discussed in length in ref .",
    ", strong coulomb interactions can dramatically reduce the effective value of the transverse hopping and retard the dimensionality crossover from a one - dimensional ( 1d ) to a two- or three - dimensional conductor .",
    "the simplest theoretical testing ground for this idea is a 2-leg ladder consisting of interacting spinless fermions on two chains coupled by a transverse hopping @xmath0 .",
    "it is in principle possible to study the putative renormalization of @xmath0 .",
    "this has been done using various approaches , among which exact diagonalization@xcite , momentum - space renormalization@xcite , and bosonization@xcite . in all these papers ,",
    "renormalization of the interchain hopping is confirmed .",
    "what we propose is a numerical calculation of this two - chain problem at quarter - filling using the efficient density - matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) in order to directly measure power law exponents and the effective value of the interchain hopping .",
    "although the dmrg has recently been tried@xcite on spinless fermions , the analysis focused on a half - filled ladder and the nearest neighbor current correlations .",
    "we shall first present the model hamiltonian we shall be using throughout and , second , the proposed dmrg procedure .",
    "thirdly , we shall validate our approach on the single chain situation .",
    "we thereafter present the results for two chains and discuss the results in the light of the various theoretical treatments .",
    "a brief summary follows .",
    "we shall use the model hamiltonian proposed by capponi _",
    "et al._@xcite for two quarter - filled chains of spinless fermions that interact within each chain through a finite extent coulomb potential and can hop between chains through the hopping term @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath1 where @xmath2 annihilates a fermion at site @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) on chain @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the occupancy at the same site , and @xmath8 is the intra - chain interaction between first , second , and third neighboring sites ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 as the interaction strength .",
    "we have set the intra - chain hopping element equal to one .",
    "we have chosen an interaction to third nearest neighbor because the work of capponi showed that the single - fermion exponent @xmath11 , characterizing the long - range single - chain inter - site transfer function @xmath12 can become very large ( @xmath13 for @xmath14 ) .",
    "this power exponent is responsible for the perhaps better known singularity in the momentum distribution at the fermi level of luttinger liquids . in the limit of small @xmath11 , one has @xmath15",
    "\\sim \\left| k - k_{f}\\right| ^{\\alpha } \\mathrm{sign}(k_{f}-k)$ ] .",
    "large values of @xmath11 will be easily observed and are expected to lead to much more important effects on the effective value of @xmath16 .",
    "large values of @xmath11 are also synonymous with strong variations in the stiffness @xmath17 .",
    "the two are related through the relation @xmath18 for spinless fermions on a chain .",
    "consequently , the power law exponents of the various response functions , which are related to @xmath17 , will also be strongly affected .",
    "the exact diagonalization of eq.([eq : h ] ) by capponi@xcite was for short chains of up to twenty sites .",
    "needless to say that some sort of extrapolation procedure , finite - size scaling in this case , was needed to obtain ground state information in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have chosen to use the dmrg since much longer chains can be studied .",
    "this , in principle at least , should take the system much closer to the thermodynamic limit and do away with the requirement of performing a finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "another shortcoming of short chain lengths has to do with a `` dimensionality '' crossover in the interchain hopping@xcite . for temperatures or frequencies larger than approximately @xmath19",
    ", the chains do not `` see '' the interchain hopping , which is incoherent or diffusive , and they are approximately independent .",
    "but in the opposite situation , the chains are tightly coupled and they form bands having transverse dispersion .",
    "let us illustrate this in the situation of quarter filling for @xmath20 and an even number of fermions .",
    "an exact solution to two coupled chains is available .",
    "the states are labelled by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and have energy @xmath23 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "all levels up to @xmath25 are filled with @xmath26 fermions .",
    "there is no interchain hopping .",
    "as @xmath19 increases , this remains so until @xmath27 , that is until @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is the fermi velocity equal to @xmath30 in our units . at this point",
    "there is a sudden change in interchain hopping since the two top levels below the fermi level are @xmath31 states .",
    "the total interchain hopping energy @xmath32 is now @xmath33 the next jump occurs at @xmath34 when @xmath35 , after which @xmath36 . at",
    "a given @xmath37 the jumps occur at @xmath38 $ ] for @xmath39 , when @xmath40 taking @xmath41 for example , @xmath42 .",
    "this is a large value .",
    "it is therefore difficult to attempt finite - size scaling or the dmrg under such conditions .",
    "one can only hope of reaching the thermodynamic limit for @xmath43 .",
    "this behavior is surely attenuated in the presence of the coulomb interaction which scrambles the spectrum .",
    "but short chains remain unpredictable because of the discrete energy spectrum .",
    "thus the longer chain lengths obtainable with the dmrg would circumvent this potential numerical distortion . in the event that @xmath16 renormalizes to much smaller values",
    "than the bare one , this crossover phenomenon might even prove cumbersome to the dmrg . in order to avoid potential problem we chose to use the finite system algorithm proposed by white@xcite , projecting out the ground state of the superblock . at a given @xmath10",
    ", we started with the procedure with largest value of @xmath44 we wished to consider , @xmath45 in all cases , and then gradually decreased its value using the previous solution as a seed .",
    "for each set of parameters , the iterations stopped when the discontinuity in the ground state energy and the excitation energy @xmath46 at mid - course , when all block information has just been refreshed , were judged acceptable .",
    "this was typically for 3 iterations .",
    "we used open boundary conditions since periodic boundary conditions lead to unacceptably large truncation errors .",
    "let us lastly comment on the number of central sites to use in the dmrg algorithm .",
    "the long - range character of the coulomb interaction complicates the calculations . for two inner double - sites ( two sites on each chain ) , the computation resources ( execution time and memory requirements )",
    "scale roughly as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of sites in each of the side blocks .",
    "this comes from the coupling of the two blocks through @xmath49 . if one instead chooses to have three inner double - sites , the blocks no longer couple and the resources scale as @xmath50 which comes from the coupling of the inner sites to each block .",
    "we have found that the resources are similar for @xmath51 in qualitative agreement with this crude analysis .",
    "we have used two inner sites for the values of @xmath52 and three for @xmath53 .",
    "it is of utmost importance to test our dmrg procedure on simpler single - chain problems .",
    "there are two delicate aspects that need to be validated , both linked to the open - ended boundary conditions .",
    "the first one has to do with the value of @xmath54 that can be chosen for a specific band filling .",
    "the second one concerns the numerical treatment that must be done on the data in order to generate information for infinite - length chains .",
    "the sensitivity to open ended boundary conditions can be illustrated for a chain of spinless fermions with an interaction extending only to nearest neighbor sites ( @xmath55 ) near half filling .",
    "the ground state and the excitation energy are completely different for the @xmath56 and @xmath57 situations , where @xmath58 is the number of fermions .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the ground state excitation energy in both situations for a calculation with @xmath59 block states and @xmath60 .",
    "although @xmath48 seems small , the truncation error was nevertheless smaller than @xmath61 for an open ended chain .",
    "a gap develops for the case @xmath62 and @xmath63 but not for the other . as for the ground states ,",
    "they show a site occupancy @xmath64 that is alternating between a large and a small value .",
    "this basic pattern is to be expected for a broken symmetry state with a repulsive interaction .",
    "but while the modulation phase @xmath65 is a constant for @xmath62 , it varies for @xmath66 .",
    "we find @xmath67 in a calculation where the interaction is introduced right away in the first iteration of the finite size algorithm ( sudden turn on ) but @xmath68 when a first set of iterations is done with @xmath20 and then @xmath10 is introduced in the second set of iterations , using the first one as seed ( gradual turn on ) .",
    "the ground state energy is lowest in the latter situation .",
    "the alternating occupancy in the ground state can be understood by looking at the large @xmath10 limit when one might expect the fermions to segregate on alternating sites @xmath69 .",
    "it is the boundary conditions that will determine the modulation phase . for @xmath62",
    ", one would expect @xmath70 to be the stablest situation , with @xmath71 , and this would explain a uniform modulation and the excitation gap .",
    "but for @xmath66 , the chain will spontaneously create a kink soliton ( phase shift of @xmath72 from end to end ) @xmath73 which can then redistribute itself and lead to a gapless excitation situation . this",
    "is found for the sudden turn on .",
    "however , it is also possible for the chain to generate additional kink - antikink excitations .",
    "the results for the gradual turn on confirm this and show that this situation is more stable .",
    "just how many kink - antikink pairs would be generated is impossible to figure out with the dmrg .",
    "curiously , the dmrg seems unable to yield an unambiguous ground state when @xmath56 for open boundary conditions .",
    "the single - chain hamiltonian we have just been studying is akin to the xxz problem for a spin 1/2 chain@xcite .",
    "this spin hamiltonian can be transformed , using the wigner - jordan transformation , into our problem with @xmath74 and @xmath75 except for end terms @xmath76 , involving the first and last sites , that occur for open boundary conditions .",
    "the xxz chain is known to develop a gap for @xmath77 , that is for @xmath78 . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the ground state is degenerate , @xmath79 and @xmath80 has no soliton because of the end site repulsion and has a gap .",
    "it is the pressure applied to the fermions by the end terms that insures the presence of an excitation energy and a uniform modulation amplitude in this situation . in the case of our ladder with @xmath81 , it is the shorter length that adds extra pressure to the fermions and similarly leads to a gapped situation .    in view of this dichotomy with respect to occupation near",
    "half filling , it is legitimate to ask if this sensitivity persists near quarter filling . to this end , we did a limited incursion with _ gradual turn on _ at @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and for first neighbor ( @xmath85 ) , second neighbor ( @xmath86 ) , and third neighbor ( @xmath87 ) interactions .",
    "the ground state energy per fermion for a given interaction range decreases slightly with @xmath54 . the effective constraining `` pressure '' when @xmath88 ( @xmath89 can explain this . the ground state excitation energy @xmath46 remains small going from 0.046 to 0.11 as the range increases and is insensitive to @xmath54 . judging from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , this is not a significant gap and is due to the finite length of the chains .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the excitation energy as a function of the inverse of the chain length for a third - neighbor interaction strength @xmath82 and @xmath59 .",
    "the extrapolated gap for @xmath90 is indeed negligibly small .",
    "there is , however , a variation of the modulation of the site occupancy of the form @xmath91 indeed , for @xmath92 , we find @xmath93 .",
    "this situation is the generalization of the one seen above for half filling and gradual turn on condition , the quantum of phase shift being @xmath94 instead of @xmath95 .",
    "what this @xmath65 means is that the fermi momentum is downward shifted from its exact quarter - filled value @xmath96 due to fermions being pushed to the ends .",
    "the question spontaneously arises as to any possible detrimental effect of such modulation on the correlation functions .",
    "we shall answer this in the following subsection .",
    "we have just found that a modulation in the site occupancy results from the open boundary conditions which pin fermions at the end site and lead to a broken symmetry state .",
    "this modulation obviously makes it non trivial to get occupancies ( the @xmath97 ) or correlation functions resembling those for periodic boundary conditions or an infinite chain .",
    "taking the occupancy as an example , for the quarter - filled situation , it can be seen that the modulated part @xmath98 can be made less annoying by averaging over the natural four site cycle .",
    "indeed , if we define for instance @xmath99 ( 3\\pi /4n)$ ] , one immediately sees that the modulation is reduced by a factor of order @xmath100 . a second averaging , @xmath101 ,",
    "would further reduce it by another @xmath102 .",
    "one can thus , for all practical purposes , remove the effect of the modulation for long chains , thus our choice of long chain lengths .",
    "we have used throughout what follows double averaging with interactions reaching to third neighbor at quarter filling .",
    "but , unfortunately , the open boundary conditions produce yet another deformation .",
    "the smoothed quantities , like @xmath97 , are not global quantities but rather local ones .",
    "they vary along the chain , the more so the closer a site is to the ends .",
    "we can illustrate this by looking at the profile of the single - fermion transfer function @xmath103 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c1 ] ) using double averaging , @xmath92 , @xmath82 and @xmath59 .",
    "the plots are for @xmath104 since the results are symmetrical about this last value .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows this function for @xmath105 , normalized to @xmath106 .",
    "the healing distance increases with @xmath107 and is at the scale of @xmath107 .",
    "it is quite obvious that the ends can have dramatic effects at the larger values of @xmath107 .",
    "we have used this optimal positioning at @xmath108 in all calculations reported below of quantities dependent on @xmath107 .    but are averaging and optimal positioning sufficient to obtain results corresponding to the thermodynamic limit ? we can check this by extracting the power law exponent of the inter - site transfer function @xmath109 . in order to do so",
    ", one needs to have an analytic function with which to fit the data for @xmath110 . from the known form of the single - particle green s function of a luttinger liquid@xcite",
    ", this function would read as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the fermi momentum .",
    "this form was obtained from bosonization and @xmath113 is a characteristic cutoff parameter .",
    "this form , however , has to be modified to account for the dmrg procedure on a finite lattice .",
    "we find that the gap associated with a finite @xmath54 introduces a numerical coherence length @xmath114 in much the same way that a temperature @xmath115 would .",
    "we thus propose the substitution @xmath116 and thus the following form @xmath117 we calculated @xmath110 for a chain having @xmath92 , @xmath118 , and @xmath59 .",

    "the fitted parameters , in the range @xmath120 , are in table [ table1 ] .",
    "it is seen that @xmath121 as expected .",
    "the power law exponents @xmath122 are those found by capponi _",
    "et al_.@xcite although they seem systematically larger by 5 - 8 % .",
    "the coherence lengths are satisfactorily quite large , giving added credibility to our fitting function .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath123 and @xmath124 is 0.986 indicating that the two parameters are strongly correlated . finally , the cutoff @xmath125 is of order one , the lattice parameter , as one would expect for fermions on a lattice .",
    "it can thus be concluded that the fitting function , eq . ( [ eq : c1b ] ) , is quite satisfactory , with an error margin of order 5 % , considering the large number of adjustable parameters .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is thus recovered albeit slightly handicapped by a numerical coherence length @xmath114 .",
    "now how does the @xmath126 charge density fluctuation response function turn out ?",
    "we also calculated the correlation function @xmath127 where @xmath128 this function measures the correlation between occupancy ( proportional to charge ) fluctuations on site @xmath3 and @xmath129 .",
    "it has the advantage of getting at the true fluctuation correlations in a broken symmetry state .",
    "there are , however , many wavenumber contributions to two - fermion green s functions@xcite .",

    "one final observation is warranted .",

    "first of all , fermions are pushed to the ends by the coulomb repulsion .",

    "the chain with @xmath150 fermions is more compressed and can not easily sustain solitons .",

    "the splitting , albeit small , of the different @xmath82 curves is caused by just this effect .",

    "they rapidly become quite noisy when they reach the limits set by the truncation error .",
    "this can easily be monitored on a logarithmic plot of the amplitude of @xmath257 as a function of @xmath107 .",
    "there is a sudden break in the general linearlike decrease .",
    "the range of values in which a function having an amplitude of the type proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polarfit ] ) can be appropriate is often limited to @xmath258 when the coherence lengths are small .",
    "we have extended our calculations to @xmath259 for a few cases as a check of the sturdiness of our calculations .",
    "it is mostly @xmath260 that is affected by a noticeable increase .",
    "curve fitting with many parameters can thus become delicate and leads to large uncertainties which we estimate at 10% for @xmath261 .",

    "this behavior is , we believe , intrinsic to the coupled chains and is not a result of short coherence lengths since these are of the same size for @xmath234 .",
    "it indicates a crossover from a single - fermion dominated behavior , when the charge fluctuations are propagated through independent band - like particle and hole motion showing two wavenumbers in the charge response function , to a pair behavior , when the fluctuations are carried by particle - hole pairs having chain - like character sharing a common wavenumber .",
    "such a crossover was deduced by capponi@xcite in the same range of values of @xmath10 . in this crossover region , there is fierce competition between single - fermion behavior and coherent pair motion .",
    "the computer resources are shared between the two competing behaviors and this explains the shorter coherence lengths in the crossover region . in spite of the domination of the pair motion , the transverse hopping",
    "is not necessarily confined as fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows .",
    "there are no clear crossovers at the larger @xmath16 , using the criteria discussed in the previous subsection , but the hopping is considerable and decreases only slowly with distance .",
    "there may well be coexistence between coherent interchain pairing and some sort of interband single particle behavior before the strong - coupling limit is reached , a possibility raised by nlk .",
    "it should finally be mentioned that , as was described in section [ sec : dataproc ] for single chains , we find a broken symmetry state in which the total on - site occupancy variation @xmath270 is proportional to the square root of the charge correlation amplitude @xmath271 near the ends .",
    "let us now sum up the more important findings on the quarter - filled double - chain problem .",
    "our working hypothesis is that the fitting functions and the data treatment we have used for the analysis of one- and two - particle functions , which were validated for single chains , can safely be carried over to two coupled chains .",
    "the central result , which motivated this whole study , is the confirmation of strong renormalization of the inter - chain hopping in the presence of the coulomb interaction @xmath10 .",
    "this was measured by monitoring the difference in the fermi momentum of the two bands beyond the dimensionality crossover .",
    "the extent of the renormalization is much stronger that expected from the rg or bosonization at small @xmath10 .",
    "it is considerable at the larger @xmath10 .",
    "it is most likely going to zero as can be concluded by observing the trend in @xmath272 which decreases with @xmath16 .",
    "the proposed crossover law , eq .",
    "( [ eq : renormlaw ] ) , was seen to be only approximately valid when the crossover exists .",
    "it is probably our definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tperp ] ) , and band edge effects that are responsible .    \\2 .",
    "the single - fermion transfer function power - law exponent @xmath273 and the polarization correlation function exponent @xmath252 were seen to be essentially those of the single chain .",
    "this is interpreted as a sign of possible violation of spin - charge separation .",
    "the charge correlation function shows superposition of two wavenumbers and has an exponent @xmath261 that is twice as large as the one for polarization for @xmath262 .",
    "this indicates the existence of a crossover from independent particle - hole motion to correlated pair motion between @xmath211 and @xmath269 .",
    "the ground state excitation energy , when extrapolated to @xmath274 , is as expected for a finite system of 150 sites .",
    "the coupled chains thus remain gapless .",
    "there are also indications , in the same limit , of possible strong coupling regimes as inferred from the linear - like @xmath16 dependence of the extrapolated inverse coherence lengths , much in the same way that bosonization predicts .",
    "the rather short numerical coherence lengths we have encountered with the dmrg , although expected from the study on single - chains , did put some stress on the curve fitting procedures .",
