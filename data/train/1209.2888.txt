    "the local current through the two current arms , @xmath190 , is suppressed in the case of half integer flux quanta showing a similar behavior to the nonlocal currents @xmath194 and @xmath138 ( ) , but with more irregularities due to the stronger effective influence of the y - polarized photon field .",
    "it is interesting to note that the current suppression dip at @xmath159  t ( marked by the blue arrow in ) appears also in the local current ( blue dashed curve ) flowing through both ring arms from the left to the right .",
    "the circular local current reaches a maximum absolute value of @xmath239  na smaller than for x - polarization .",
    "it is clearly visible from a comparison of and that the circular current is considerably smaller than in the x - polarized photon case , while the total local current is of the same order .",
    "thus , the capability of the magnetic field to drive a rotational ring current is weakened by having the electromagnetic field y - polarized .",
    "in particular , this can be said about the diamagnetic part of the circular local current leading to the much smaller value @xmath240  na at low magnetic field @xmath197  t. the periodicity of the circular local current is preserved better for x - polarized photon field as is for the total local current .",
    "we note here in passing that it is not possible to understand the non - trivial magnetic field dependence of @xmath192 by resorting solely to a tl description .",
    "we have presented a time - convolutionless generalized master equation formalism that allows us to calculate the non - equilibrium transport of coulomb interacting electrons through a broad quantum ring in a photon cavity under the influence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the topologically nontrivial broad ring geometry allows for substantial electron - electron correlations relative to their kinetic energy and , hence , a large basis is required for sufficient numerical accuracy .",
    "the magnetic field , however , increases slightly the energy difference of the 2es with respect to the 1es , thus enhancing the 1es occupation while suppressing the 2es occupation .",
    "the central quantum ring 1es are charged quickly from both leads .",
    "electron - electron correlation and sequential tunneling slow down the 2es charging in the long - time response regime .",

    ", we have found charge oscillations between the left and right part of the quantum ring when the magnetic field is associated with integer flux quanta .",
    "the oscillation frequency agrees well with the energy difference of the two mostly occupied states .",
    "the relatively high energy difference for x - polarized photons is related to a relatively high transient current through the ring .",
    "the amplitude of the charge oscillations through the quantum ring is decreasing in time due to dissipation effects caused by the coupling to the leads .",
    "in general , the local current through the upper ring arm exhibits opposite sign to the local current through the lower ring arm .",
    "hence , the `` persistent '' circular local current is usually larger than the total local charge current through both ring arms from the left to the right .",
    "the persistent current shows a periodic behavior with magnetic field , but with a tendency to clockwise rotation due to the contact region vortex structure .",
    "in the case of y - polarized photon field , the magnetic field dependence of the left and right charge current exhibits a pronounced dip at magnetic field @xmath159  t corresponding to two flux quanta that is therefore clearly not related to the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the dip is associated with a degeneracy of the two mostly occupied 1es at magnetic field associated with two flux quanta .",
    "the additional level crossing appears only for y - polarized photons .",
    "the generally lower energy difference of the two mostly occupied mb states in the case of y - polarization disturbs the constructive phase interference condition for the bias driven charge flow through the quantum device and decreases the persistent current magnitude .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated for our ring geometry that y - polarized photons disturb our system stronger than x - polarized photons , suppressing magnetic field induced currents and perturbing flux periodicity beyond finite width effects by enhancing or suppressing bias - driven currents .",
    "it is interesting to compare these findings to the quantum wire case , where it was found that mainly x - polarized photons attenuate the central system charging due to a closer agreement of the photon mode energy and the characteristic electronic excitation energy in x - direction .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we have considered a more complex geometry , which reduces effectively the y - confinement energy @xmath242  mev . the characteristic electronic excitation energy in y - direction may therefore be much closer to the photon mode energy @xmath243  mev , thus leading to a relatively strong influence of the y - polarized photon field on the electronic transport .",
    "the conceived magnetic field influenced quantum ring system in a photon cavity could serve as an elementary quantum device for optoelectronic applications and quantum information processing with unique characteristics by controlling the applied magnetic field and the polarization of the photon field .",
