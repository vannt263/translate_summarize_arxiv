    "dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) are the most abundant galaxy type in clusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "they are faint , with exponentially declining surface brightness profiles @xcite . until recently",
    ", des were thought to have lost their gas and dust long ago .",
    "several evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain this apparent lack of an interstellar medium ( ism ) in des .",
    "the wind - model ( e.g. @xcite ) proposes that des are primordial objects that lost their gas after it was heated above the escape velocity by supernova explosions . alternatively , the frequent high - speed interactions with giant cluster - members to which a small late - type disc galaxy ( sc - sd ) is subjected and the subsequent starbursts can transform it into a gasless spheroidal de - like object .",
    "this ` galaxy harassment ' process @xcite induces a dramatic morphological evolution on a time - span of about 3gyr . moreover",
    ", hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies moving through the hot , thin intergalactic medium in clusters @xcite or groups @xcite show that ram - pressure stripping can completely remove the ism of a dwarf galaxy less massive than @xmath5m@xmath4 within a few 100myr . if the ram pressure is strong enough ,",
    "the interstellar medium may be compressed and localised star bursts may ensue .",
    "low - mass dwarfs ( @xmath6m@xmath4 ) lose their gas very rapidly , leaving virtually no time for star - formation after entering the cluster of group . yet",
    "another possibility is that des are related to other dwarf galaxies such as blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) .",
    "the ` fading model ' conjectures that star - forming dwarf galaxies will fade and reach an end - state similar to present - day des after they have used up their gas supply and star - formation has ended , although some controversy still remains @xcite .",
    "interactions may have sped up the gas - depletion process , explaining both the abundance of des and the paucity of bcds in high - density environments . these different scenarios to explain the origin of des are not mutually excluding .",
    "an important common point between the propositions is that they all remove the gas from dwarf galaxies .",
    "in addition , unlike massive galaxies , des can hardly acquire gas in collisions since their escape velocity is small compared to the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters .",
    "for all these reasons , des were thought to be gas - depleted systems .",
    "however , a growing amount of evidence indicates that at least some des have retained part of their gas .",
    "since the efficiency of galaxy interactions and ram pressure at stripping the gas off a dwarf galaxy obviously depends on the dwarf s orbit , des on high angular momentum orbits in the outskirts of a cluster can be expected to be more gas - rich .",
    "this has indeed been observed in an hi study of a sample of virgo des by @xcite .",
    "they find that hi detected des are preferentially located near the periphery of the virgo cluster , with an overall detection rate of about 15 per cent . in a spectroscopic survey of the fornax cluster , @xcite discovered h@xmath1 emission in about 25 per cent of the des .",
    "most of these galaxies also lie towards the outskirts of the cluster , while des near the centre of the cluster are generally devoid of ionized gas , again suggesting an environmental effect on the gas - depletion rate of des ( e.g. interactions or ram - pressure stripping ) and strongly hinting at an ( evolutionary ) transition between gas - rich / star - forming des at the outskirts and gasless / quiescent ones in the centre of the cluster .",
    "this paper is the second in a series on h@xmath1 imaging of the ionized ism of fornax des . in @xcite",
    "( hereafter paper  1 ) results on fcc046 and fcc207 are reported ( for fcc046 , see also de rijcke & debattista 2004 ) .",
    "both des exhibit a central emission region that could be attributed to photo - ionization by post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars .",
    "fcc046 also harbours 6 faint emission clouds with diameters and fluxes comparable to supernova remnants .",
    "the hypothesis that fcc046 is actively forming stars , albeit at a leisurely pace , is further corroborated by its blue colour and high near - infrared paschen absorption index @xcite .",
    "such des could be considered as the missing link between more vigorously star - forming dwarfs ( such as bcds ) and traditional des .    here , we present @xmath0-band and h@xmath7[nii ] narrow - band images of three fornax des ( fcc032 , fcc206 , and fccb729 ) that are expected to contain ionized gas , based on the existing spectroscopic equivalent - width ( ew ) estimates @xcite . in section [ sec_obs ] , we discuss the details of the observations and data reduction . the results based on the @xmath0-band and the h@xmath7[nii ] narrow - band images are presented in sections [ sec_rband ] and [ sec_halpha ] , respectively , and discussed in section [ sec_disc ] .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section [ sec_concl ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use @xmath8kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 and a fornax systemic velocity @xmath10kms@xmath9 , which gives a distance of 18.4mpc to the fornax cluster ..",
    "the observations were carried out on 2003 october 18 and 19 with yepun ( vlt - ut4 ) using fors2 in service mode .",
    "we took 16-min exposures with the h_alpha/2500 + 60 filter centred on 6604 ( this redshifted h@xmath1 filter gives the best overlap with the h@xmath1 emission line in galaxies at the redshift of fornax ) and with a fwhm@xmath11 .",
    "130160s exposures with the r_special@xmath1271 filter centred on 6550 and with a fwhm@xmath13 were taken to serve as off - band images .",
    "images of the spectrophotometric standard stars lb227 and ltt2415 were taken for flux - calibration . during the observations ,",
    "the seeing typically was 0.5  0.7arcsec fwhm ( determined from the stars on the images ) . the standard data reduction procedures ( bias subtraction , flatfielding , cosmic removal , sky subtraction )",
    "were performed with midas . before",
    "co - adding , all science images were corrected for atmospheric extinction , using the @xmath0-band extinction coefficient : @xmath14 provided by the eso quality control , and interstellar extinction , using the galactic extinction estimates from @xcite : @xmath15 for fcc032 , @xmath16 for fcc206 and @xmath17 for fccb729 .",
    "the images were finally converted to units of electron s@xmath9 pixel@xmath9 .    in order to find the correct scaling for the @xmath0-band images we adopted the following strategy .",
    "the pure emission ` em ' can be recovered from a narrowband image ` ha ' and an @xmath0-band image ` rb ' as @xmath18 with @xmath19 the proper scaling constant and @xmath20 a correction for possible faulty sky - subtraction . to find the best values for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we fitted the isophotes of the narrow - band and @xmath0-band images in an annulus between @xmath21 and @xmath22magarcsec@xmath23 which in retrospect did not contain any emission ( hence em@xmath24 ) , using the standard midas fit / ell3 command .",
    "thus , a smooth version of this annulus could be constructed for both images .",
    "the optimal values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be found by minimizing the expression @xmath25 with ha and rb the smoothed versions of the annulus . with these values in hand",
    ", the pure - emission image can be obtained using relation .",
    "for all galaxies , @xmath20 was essentially zero , which makes us confident that the sky was properly subtracted from all images . since the h@xmath1 narrowband and @xmath0-band filters overlap , subtracting an @xmath0-band image instead of a narrowband continuum image induces a partial removal of some h@xmath1+n[ii ] light .",
    "the error thus introduced is of the order of the ratio of the effective widths of the filters ( @xmath0-band:@xmath26 and h@xmath1:@xmath27 ) .",
    "this is less than 4 per cent which is negligible in comparison to other possible sources of error , so we did not correct for it .",
    "a pixel - value ( in electrons s@xmath9 ) in the pure - emission image , denoted as @xmath28 , can be converted to flux units ( wm@xmath23 ) , denoted by @xmath29 , using the formula @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the spectrum of a flux - calibration standard star in wm@xmath23@xmath9 and @xmath32 is the measured flux of that star , expressed in electron s@xmath9 .",

    "these knots have blue colours and luminosities comparable to globular clusters , which tempted @xcite to suggest we are witnessing the formation of a nucleus .",
    "this corroborates one currently popular hypothesis concerning the formation of nuclei in des , namely the merger of globular clusters that have been driven inward by dynamical friction ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have estimated the orbital decay timescale of a typical globular cluster of mass @xmath108m@xmath4 , starting at a radius of about 1kpc in a dwarf galaxy with a circular velocity of order @xmath109kms@xmath9 at @xmath110yr .",
    "the tidal disruption timescale is much longer so a globular cluster would not dissolve before reaching the galaxy centre where it adds its stars to the nucleus .",
    "if the point sources near the centre of fcc206 are truly globular clusters belonging to this de , their projected distances of the order of 100pc would imply the formation of a nucleus within the next @xmath111yr .",
    "nucleated des , after being stripped from their stellar envelope by tidal forces during gravitational interactions , have been suggested as possible progenitors of both the recently discovered ultra compact dwarfs @xcite and of massive globular clusters like @xmath112cen @xcite and g1 in m31 @xcite .    intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , with masses of the order @xmath113m@xmath4 ,",
    "are predicted to grow in dense star clusters @xcite . according to this scenario",
    ", a massive black hole will grow in the nucleus of the host de by the coalescence of several globular cluster imbhs .",
    "if globular clusters contain massive black holes ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , which is still debated , and the nuclei in de , ns form from merging globular clusters , these nuclei could be expected to contain super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "thus understanding how the nuclei of de , ns form may also help us understand how smbhs grow .",
    "this work is based on observations collected at the european southern observatory , chile ( eso programme nr . 072.b-0134 ) .",
