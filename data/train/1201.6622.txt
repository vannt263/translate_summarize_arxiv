    "light - front models are useful to describe hadronic bound states , like mesons or baryons due to its particular boost properties  @xcite . however , the light - front description in a truncated fock - space breaks the rotational symmetry because the associated transformation is a dynamical boost  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an analysis with covariant analytical models , can be useful to pin down the main missing features in a truncated light - front fock - space description of the composite system . in this respect , the rotational symmetry breaking of the plus component of the electromagnetic current , in the drell - yan frame ,",
    "was recently studied within an analytical model for the spin-1 vertex of a composite two - fermion bound state  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , if pair term contributions are ignored in the evaluation of the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current , the covariance of the form factors is lost  @xcite .    the complete restoration of covariance in the form factor calculation is found only when pair terms or zero modes contributions to the matrix elements of the current are considered  @xcite .",
    "the extraction of the electromagnetic form - factors of a spin-1 composite particle from the microscopic matrix elements of the plus component of the current ( @xmath1 ) in the drell - yan frame ( momentum transfer @xmath2 ) , based only on the valence component of the wave function , presents ambiguities due to the lacking of the rotational invariance of the current model  @xcite . in the breit - frame with momentum transfers along the transverse direction ( the drell - yan condition is satisfied ) the current @xmath3 has four independent matrix elements , although only three form factors exist .",
    "therefore , the matrix elements satisfies an identity , known as the angular condition  @xcite , which is violated .",
    "several extraction schemes for evaluating the form - factors were proposed , and in particular we consider the suggestion made in ref .",
    "it was found in a numerical calculation of the @xmath4-meson electromagnetic form factors considering only the valence contribution  @xcite , that the prescription proposed by  @xcite to evaluate the form - factors , produced results in agreement with the covariant calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was used an analytical form of the @xmath4-quark - antiquark vertex .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the above prescription eliminates the pair diagram contributions to the form factors , using a simplified form of the model , when the matrix elements of the current were evaluated for spin-1 light - cone polarization states .",
    "this nice result was thought to be due to the use of the particular light - cone polarization states . here",
    ", we will show in a straightforward and analytic manner that the cancelation of the pair contribution in the evaluation of the form factors using the prescription from ref .",
    "@xcite also happens for the instant form polarization states in the cartesian representation , generalizing the previous conclusion  @xcite .",
    "our aim , is to expose in a simple and detailed form , how the pair terms appear in the matrix elements of the current evaluated between instant form polarization states , and their cancelation in the form factors using the correct prescription .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this property is more general than realized before .",
    "but , in the case of spin-0 composite particles ( like the pion ) with the correspondent form of the analytical model , the plus component of the electromagnetic current in the breit - frame , with @xmath5 , does not have contributions from pair terms  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic current has the following general form for spin-1 particles  @xcite : @xmath6 ( p^\\mu + p^{\\prime \\mu } )    - f_3(q^2 )   ( q_\\alpha g_\\beta^\\mu- q_\\beta g_\\alpha^\\mu ) \\ ,    \\label{eq : curr1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the mass of the vector particle , @xmath8 is the momentum transfer , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is on - shell initial and final momentum respectively . from the covariant form factors @xmath11 ,",
