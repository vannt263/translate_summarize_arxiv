    "the variations of the saddle point energy with the mass asymmetry parameter @xmath126 ( which is almost linear function of the mass asymmetry @xmath102 ) for some even - mass isotopes of th and u are plotted in figures  1  and  2 .",

    "the liquid drop model saddle point shapes and energy barrier heights are well reproduced by the present method . by adding shell corrections to the ldm energy we succeded to obtain the minima shown in figures  1  and  2 at a finite value of mass asymmetry for the binary fission of @xmath5th and @xmath6u nuclei .    as mentioned by wilkins et al .",
    "@xcite , calculations of pes for fissioning nuclei `` qualitatively account for an asymmetric division of mass '' . from the qualitative point of view the results displayed in figures 1 and 2 proove the capability of the method to deal with fission mass and charge asymmetry .",
    "the experimentally determined mass number of the most probable heavy fragment @xcite for u isotopes ranges from 134 to 140 .",
    "the corresponding values at the displayed minima in figures 1 and 2 are very close to 125 , which means a discrepancy between 6.7  % and 10.7  % for @xmath131 .",
    "the inaccuracy in reproducing the experimental mass asymmetry is due to the contribution of the phenomenological shell corrections . in the absence of shell corrections",
    "the pure liquid drop model ( ldm ) reflection - symmetric saddle point shapes [ 8 ] are reproduced , and the barrier height increseas with an increased mass asymmetry .",
    "when the shell corrections are taken into account the ldm part behaves in the same manner ( larger values at non - zero mass asymmetry ) .",
    "only the contribution of shell effects can produce a minimum of the barrier height at a finite value of the mass asymmetry .",
