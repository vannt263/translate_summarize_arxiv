    "in this paper we study the problem of constructing lagrangian immersions with the minimal possible number of transverse self - intersection points .",
    "it is well known that the existence of a lagrangian embedding imposes strong topological constraints ( e.g.  gromov s theorem about non - existence of exact lagrangian submanifolds in standard symplectic @xmath5-space , @xmath6 ) , and also that , in many cases , two lagrangian submanifolds must intersect in more points than is suggested by topological intersection theory alone ( e.g.  results confirming arnold s conjectures ) . in view of this , it was expected that there should be similar lower bounds on the minimal number of double points for lagrangian immersions , e.g.  that an exact lagrangian immersion of an @xmath7-torus into @xmath8 with transverse self - intersections would have at least @xmath9 double points .",
    "bounds of this kind have been proved for lagrangian immersions satisfying additional conditions .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that any self - transverse exact lagrangian immersion @xmath10 of a closed @xmath7-manifold , for which the legendrian lift @xmath11 has legendrian homology algebra that admits an augmentation , satisfies the following analogue of the morse inequalities : the number of double points of @xmath12 is at least @xmath13 .    here",
    "we prove a surprising result in sharp contrast to such lower bounds : if no extra constraints are imposed then lagrangian immersions into symplectic manifolds of dimension @xmath14 with _ nearly the minimal _ number of self - intersection points satisfy a certain @xmath0-principle .",
    "let us introduce the notation needed to state the result .",
    "let @xmath15 be an oriented @xmath5-manifold and @xmath16 a proper smooth immersion of a connected @xmath7-manifold .",
    "if @xmath17 is non - compact we will assume that @xmath12 is an embedding outside of a compact set .",
    "following whitney @xcite , if @xmath12 is self - transverse we assign a self - intersection number @xmath18 to @xmath12 , where @xmath18 is the mod 2 number of self - intersection points if @xmath7 is odd or @xmath17 is non - orientable , and the algebraic number of self - intersection points counted with their intersection signs if @xmath7 is even and @xmath17 is orientable .",
    "note that @xmath19 depends only on the regular homotopy class of @xmath12 provided that @xmath17 is closed or that the regular homotopy is an isotopy at infinity .",
    "when @xmath20 and @xmath15 is simply connected , a theorem of whitney @xcite asserts that an immersion @xmath12 is regularly homotopic to an embedding if and only if @xmath21 .",
