    "in this paper we study the importance of nuclear finite size effects in inclusive muon capture reactions .",
    "the motivation for this investigation comes from the results of a recent publication @xcite , where we have developed a model which describes rather well the inclusive @xmath0c@xmath1 and @xmath0c@xmath2 cross sections near threshold , and inclusive muon capture by nuclei .",
    "this approach , which is an extension of the quasi - elastic inclusive electron scattering model of @xcite , is based on a local fermi gas ( lfg ) , where the simplicity of the model makes it possible to include a great variety of effects into the reaction dynamics @xcite . in particular long - range nuclear correlations",
    "are taken into account by computing the rpa polarization propagator containing nucleonic and @xmath3 degrees of freedom .",
    "all these effects are crucial for the correct analysis of atmospheric neutrino fluxes @xcite and to describe the recent neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite , particularly those of muon capture , indicate that for some kind of inclusive reactions the validity of the lfg can be extended to energies lower than expected .",
    "although the lfg leads to reasonable predictions for integrated quantities , at low energies it is not possible to describe the shape of the differential neutrino cross section or muon capture width within this model .",
    "in fact both the discrete and the continuum states of the final nucleus , including giant resonances , contribute .",
    "however , when one sums over all the final states , the information about the fine details of the spectrum is lost and only the global contribution remains .",
    "therefore for some integrated inclusive observables , the results depend mainly on global quantities such as the correct energy balance or the nucleon distribution .",
    "an example is the inclusive pion capture model of @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to mention the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of comparing shell model with fermi gas for @xmath4-inclusive neutrino scattering .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate whether finite nucleus effects can affect significantly the lfg results of ref .",
    "@xcite for inclusive muon capture . from the present calculation it is possible to estimate an uncertainty of 17% due to finite size effects not taken into account in the lfg calculation of @xcite .",
    "there already exist microscopic calculations of neutrino - nucleus reactions and muon capture , based on the rpa or large shell model ( sm ) basis @xcite , and other approaches such as the relativistic shell model @xcite and the green s function method @xcite .",
    "all of them treat correctly the finite size of the system .",
    "however from direct comparison of these models with the lfg it is not possible to deduce the importance of the finite nucleus treatment .",
    "the reason is that such comparison should be done between models embodying exactly the same nuclear dynamics . instead a great variety of residual interactions , shell model wave functions , current operators , coulomb effects , etc .",
    ", have been used in these works , making it impossible to disentangle the impact of the finite size on the different contributions .    before such comparison",
    "be undertaken in a sophisticated framework , it is convenient to understand the uncorrelated case .",
    "for this reason we have chosen to perform this comparison with a simple model where the finite - size effects can be easily recognized . thus here",
    "we consider the extreme sm , i.e. , single particle states in a woods - saxon ( ws ) potential , and we compare the results with those obtained from a lfg model .",
    "we do not include long range correlations of rpa type or configuration mixing .",
    "in addition we use the static form of the single - nucleon charged current ( cc ) , in order to simplify even more the calculation and to draw cleaner conclusions . on the other hand , within our simplified approach ,",
    "we do not confine ourselves to the single case of @xmath0c , but make a more thorough study of how finite size effects vary with increasing nuclear mass , by comparing the results for a set of closed shell nuclei : @xmath0c , @xmath5o , @xmath6ca , and @xmath7pb .",
    "the present calculation represents a first - stage test case to check the `` equivalence '' of lfg and shell models for some inclusive processes .",
    "we choose the @xmath8-capture reaction for this investigation since it involves low excitation energies , the worst conditions for the lfg .",
    "of course , under these simplifications it makes no sense to compare our results with the experimental data @xcite , nor it is the intention of this work , since it was already done in ref .",
    "@xcite with the full model .",
    "here we present the formalism to describe the inclusive muon capture within our model .",
    "we use bjorken & drell @xcite conventions . we consider a negative muon bound into an initial nucleus @xmath9 ,",
    "which decay into a final nucleus @xmath10 plus a muon neutrino ( not detected ) . @xmath11 the final nucleus can be in the discrete or in the continuum .",
    "we assume that the initial muon is in a @xmath12-wave state ( normalized to one ) @xmath13 we describe the wave function @xmath14 in a non - relativistic framework by solving the schrdinger equation for the muon in the nuclear coulomb potential , including finite size and vacuum polarization effects .",
    "the final neutrino has four - momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the leptonic current matrix element involved in the decay is then @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the space - time coordinate , @xmath18 is the time - depending muon wave function @xmath19 and @xmath20 is its initial energy ( including the binding ) . since we treat the muon as non - relativistic , we describe its spin by a pauli spinor @xmath21 which is contained into the leptonic vector @xmath22 , defined by @xmath23^{1/2 } \\overline{u}_\\nu({{\\bf k}}')\\gamma^\\mu(1-\\gamma_5)u_\\mu(0)\\ ] ] where we have written the muon four - spinor as @xmath24 , i.e. , corresponding effectively to a four - spinor with momentum zero .",
    "this is equivalent to neglect in the following the initial muon momentum @xmath25 in the kinematics however the full spatial dependence of the wave function @xmath26 is maintained in the matrix element , see below .",
    "finally in ( [ lepton - vector ] ) @xmath27 is the normalization volume of the neutrino plane wave , and @xmath28 its mass , that is set to zero at the end of the calculation .",
    "the @xmath29-matrix element relevant for the decay reaction ( [ decay ] ) is then @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the initial and final nuclear states , with energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , @xmath35 is the energy transfer , @xmath36 is the fermi coupling constant multiplied by the cosine of cabibbo s angle , and we have introduced the effective current operator @xmath37 , defined in coordinate space as @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the nuclear cc operator to be specified below . finally , @xmath40 is the fourier transform @xmath41    the differential decay width can be computed easily . since the initial nucleus is unpolarized , the distribution of neutrinos is independent of the angles , and the corresponding angular integral gives a factor @xmath42 .    at this point",
    "we have to distinguish two cases , depending on the kind of final state @xmath32 reached . in the first case the final nucleus is in a discrete state , that can be the ground state or an excited state .",
    "the neutrino energy takes discrete values fixed by energy conservation , and the partial width for the transition @xmath43 is written as , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and the usual leptonic tensor has been introduced @xmath46 for initial muon momentum @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the muon mass .",
    "we have also defined the muon - hadronic tensor for the transition @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the momentum transfer , we sum over final spin components @xmath51 , and average over initial spins @xmath52 .    in the second case ,",
    "the final nucleus goes to the continuum , above the one - particle emission threshold , and the final neutrino energy ranges between 0 and the maximum energy available minus the nucleon separation energy of the final nucleus .",
    "the continuum spectrum of neutrinos is described by the differential decay width @xmath53 where now the continuum hadronic tensor is defined as @xmath54 here a sum over final ( continuum ) states and an average over initial spin is assumed .",
    "the contraction between the leptonic and muon - hadronic tensor is easily performed in a coordinate system where the @xmath55 axis is in the @xmath56 direction .",
    "we finally obtain the following expression for the differential decay width @xmath57 and a similar expression for the discrete partial widths , where for simplicity the response functions have been introduced as the following components of the hadronic tensor @xcite : @xmath58    the total ( inclusive ) width is obtained by integrating and summing over the continuum and discrete , respectively @xmath59      since the shell model states have good angular momentum , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , it is usual to perform analytically the sums over third components using the wigner - eckart theorem . to this end one",
    "begins with the following multipole expansion valid for the components of any current operator in momentum space as a sum of operators with good angular momentum of rank @xmath62 ( note that the @xmath55-axis is in the @xmath56 direction ) @xmath63 \\hat{c}_{j0}(q ) \\label{rhoex } \\\\",

    "note that the above expansions ( [ rhoex][jmex ] ) are a direct consequence of the familiar plane wave expansion in spherical bessel functions and spherical harmonics , inside the fourier transform ( [ fourier ] ) .",
    "inserting the expansions ( [ rhoex][jmex ] ) inside the hadronic tensor ( [ hadronic - c ] ) we obtain @xmath69 for the responses in the discrete , and a similar expression for the continuum responses with the addition of a sum over final states and a delta of energies @xmath70 .",

    "the exclusive hadronic tensor factorizes as the product of a single nucleon hadronic tensor times a partial momentum distribution , and the calculation is straightforward in the shell model . for the present case an additional integration and a sum over initial states is needed since we are interested in the inclusive case , similar to the factorized pwia in @xmath148 introduced in @xcite .",

    "ws1 is the more realistic since it also fits the proton and neutron separation energies of @xmath0c and give reasonable masses for the ground states of the @xmath152n and @xmath152c nuclei .",

    "the neutron parameters are similar to ws1 . finally in ws3",
    "we have used a small neutron spin - orbit splitting , as for protons , but we had to make the neutron well much less attractive than for protons . apart from changing the single - particle energies",
    ", the effect of modifying the ws potential can be appreciated in the proton and neutron densities shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for more attractive potentials the nucleus becomes more dense in the interior .",
    "for this reason , the ws3 neutron density turns out to be the smallest one , while the proton density is around 3/2 the neutron one .",
    "hence the lfg results are worse for very different neutron and proton densities .",
    "in this situation the proton and neutron fermi momenta ( [ rho ] ) are clearly different , leading to a gap between proton and neutron energies , ( [ gap ] ) , which in this case is negative , since the density is smaller for neutrons , and @xmath153 .",
    "therefore a proton near the fermi surface can decay to a neutron above the neutron fermi surface with an energy decrement .",
    "this is an unrealistic situation , since precisely in this case the neutrons are less bound than protons in the sm , and therefore lie at higher energies .",
    "another argument to disregard this case is the well known property of closed ( sub)shell nuclei such as @xmath0c , for which the neutron and proton densities should be similar .",

    "the shapes of both distributions are completely different .",
    "the differences are more apparent for the ws1 potential , where there is a very high and sharp neutron resonance in the sm spectrum .",
    "the partial widths to the discrete states are shown in the right panels of fig .  2 . considering these differences in shape between the lfg and the sm",
    ", it is a very notable result that the integrated widths ( adding the discrete states ) take similar values in both models as was shown in table [ tableiv ] .",
    "this outcome agrees with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same problem was addressed in the context of inelastic electron scattering on nuclei .",
    "the biggest contribution to the width comes in all the cases from the transition to the ground state , and its magnitude does not depend very much on the potential , since in the transition @xmath156 the wave functions in the initial and final states are similar across the different potentials .",
    "note also that there are transitions to final discrete states that lie in the continuum ( particularly , transitions from the @xmath157 shell ) .",
    "these states will contribute to the giant resonances after an appropriate treatment of the residual interaction ( such as in the rpa ) . under the light of the present preliminary study and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite one expects that the inclusion of the rpa does not change too much our conclusions and the total integrated width be similar for correlated lfg and sm .",
    "ca . ]    ca . ]      in the case of @xmath5o the integrated widths computed in the lfg are also very close , @xmath1586% , to the sm results with the potentials ws1 and ws3 ( see table [ tableiv ] ) . the worse results are obtained for the ws2 parameterization ; the corresponding width is 24% of the sm one .",
    "this can also been understood in terms of what was said for the case of @xmath0c above , by looking at the @xmath5o densities shown in fig .",
    "the case of ws2 is the only one where the protons are more bound than the neutrons , hence the @xmath154-density is smaller than the @xmath155-density inside the nucleus , which is again an unrealistic situation because one expect the opposite in a closed shell nucleus such as @xmath5o .",
    "we should add that the @xmath5o nucleus is delicate in the sense that the experimental @xmath128-value of 10.93 mev is too large to be fitted by the ws parameters found in the literature @xcite .",
    "in fact in the sm the @xmath128-value is the difference between the @xmath159 and @xmath160 energies ( see table [ tableiii ] ) .",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit potential is to increase @xmath161 and to decrease @xmath162 , that is , goes to reduce the @xmath128-value .",
    "( the opposite happens for @xmath0c , where the @xmath128-value is the difference between the @xmath163 and @xmath164 energies .",
    "hence the spin - orbit goes to increase the @xmath128-value . ) therefore to make that value as large as 11 mev one needs a small spin - orbit potential , as in ws1 , or to rise the neutron well with respect to the proton well , as in ws2 , at the cost of making the neutrons less bound than protons .",
    "the first option is preferred because it allows for similar proton and neutron densities .",
    "precisely the third parameterization ws3 has been chosen with @xmath165 to maximize the difference between these two shells .",
    "the differential and partial widths of @xmath5o for the three ws potentials are shown in fig .",
    "4 . in the three cases",
    "the main contribution comes from the discrete spectrum ( see also table [ tableiv ] ) .",
    "since @xmath165 for ws3 , the dominant contribution comes from transitions from the @xmath166 to the @xmath167 shell .",
    "the lfg results improve when the mass of the nucleus increases as in the present case of the nucleus @xmath6ca .",
    "in fact , from table [ tableiv ] we see that for this nucleus the lfg integrated width is within 1% of the sm result for ws1 , and 3% and 7% in the other two cases .",
    "this improvement was expected because the fermi gas description of the nucleus should work better for heavier nuclei . in the case of ws2 and",
    "ws3 the proton parameters have been fixed to the typical values used in the literature , and we have fitted the neutron ones . since here the experimental @xmath128-value is small , @xmath168 mev , one does not need to change too much the typical neutron parameters . in the case of",
    "ws1 we have tried to maintain the @xmath155 and @xmath154 parameters similar .",
    "the proton and neutron densities are close in all cases , as shown in fig . 5 , and the proton levels always lie above the neutron ones .",
    "the neutrino spectrum shown in fig .",
    "6 presents a more complex structure than the lighter nuclei discussed above .",
    "more potential resonances arise and the discrete spectrum presents more lines distributed along the allowed energy region .      finally we discuss the results for the closed - shell heavy nucleus @xmath7pb . in table",
    "[ tableiv ] we present integrated widths only for two sets of potential parameters , ws1 and ws2 .",
    "this is the only case where we use different radius parameters for protons and neutrons and also for the central and spin - orbit parts of the potential , see table [ tableii ] . in both cases",
    "the lfg results are close , within 3 and 6% , to the sm ones .",
    "the @xmath128 value , 5.5 mev , is close to the @xmath169 and @xmath170 energy difference of typical parameterizations @xcite",
    ". only small variations of these parameterizations found in the literature are allowed if one wants to maintain the ordering of the energies around the fermi level .",
    "also only small variations are needed to fit the experimental @xmath128-value . in the present case",
    "the treatment of asymmetric nuclear mater is essential , because the proton and neutron densities , shown in fig .",
    "7 , are clearly different .",
    "therefore the correct treatment of the gap in the energy balance , eqs .",
    "( [ gap],[omega - gap ] ) , is needed to obtain the results of table [ tableiv ] .",
    "moreover in this case the neutrino spectrum shown in fig .",
    "8 shows also an improved resemblance between the lfg and sm ( although numerous potential resonances appear ) , even taking into account the distribution of the discrete spectrum .",

    "in this paper we have estimated the magnitude of the finite nucleus effects on inclusive muon capture , aiming at quantifying the uncertainty of the lfg results of ref .",
    "it is not possible to disentangle these effects by comparison with the highly sophisticated rpa or shell models existing in the literature due to the different theoretical ingredients embodied in them .    to know how much the lfg is modified by finite size effects",
    ", one would need a finite nucleus model with exactly the same input as the lfg , in order to make the comparison meaningful .",
    "obviously this would be a drawback because precisely one wants to use the lfg due to its simplicity , in order to include very complex dynamical effects hard to incorporate in finite nucleus treatments .",
    "therefore before using a very sophisticated model , it is convenient to see what happens in the uncorrelated case .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on a simple shell model without nuclear correlations , but that contains the relevant information about the finite nuclear structure , and we have compared it with the uncorrelated lfg using the same input . in particular the sm proton and neutron densities have been used in the lfg calculation . we have applied both models to a set of closed - shell nuclei : @xmath0c , @xmath5o , @xmath6ca , and @xmath7pb . in the sm",
    "we fit the experimental @xmath128-value of the decay , while the same value is used to correct the energy transfer in the lfg , taking into account also the gap between neutron and proton fermi energies .",
    "as expected , the neutrino spectrum is very different in both models , in particular the lfg can not account for the resonances and discrete states .",
    "however , in the case of the lighter nuclei , @xmath0c and @xmath5o , the sm and lfg results for the integrated width are close within 36% for ws parameters with similar neutron and proton densities , but the results are somewhat different , within 1424% , for the disregarded cases in which the protons lie below the neutrons . for the medium and heavy nuclei , @xmath6ca and @xmath7pb , the integrated widths are always very close , within 17% .",
    "the final neutrino spectra of the lfg becomes more similar to the sm , including the discrete part , for heavier nuclei . under the assumption that rpa correlations and finite size effects are somewhat decoupled for integrated inclusive observables",
    ", the present results can explain why the lfg results of ref .",
    "@xcite describe so well the experimental data .",

    "<S> motivated by recent studies of inclusive neutrino nucleus processes and muon capture within a correlated local fermi gas model ( lfg ) , we discuss the relevance of nuclear finite size effects in these reactions at low energy , in particular for muon capture . to disentangle these effects from others coming from the reaction dynamics we employ here a simple uncorrelated shell model that embodies the typical finite size content of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated decay widths of muon atoms calculated with this shell model are then compared for several nuclei with those obtained within the uncorrelated lfg , using in both models exactly the same theoretical ingredients and parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two predictions are in quite good agreement , within 17% , when the shell model density and the correct energy balance is used as input in the lfg calculation . </S>",
