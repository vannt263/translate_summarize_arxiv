    "galaxy clusters , the largest gravitationally - bound structures in the universe , are ideal cosmological tools .",
    "accurate measurements of their masses provide a crucial observational constraint on cosmological models .",
    "several dynamical methods have been available to estimate cluster masses , such as ( 1 ) optical measurements of the velocity dispersions of cluster galaxies , ( 2 ) measurements of the x - ray emitting gas , and ( 3 ) gravitational lensing .",
    "good agreements between these methods have been found on scales larger than cluster cores .",
    "however , joint measurements of lensing and x - rays often identify large discrepancies in the gravitational masses within the central regions of clusters by the two methods , and the lensing mass has always been found to be @xmath0 times higher than the x - ray determined mass .",
    "this is the so - called `` mass discrepancy problem '' ( allen 1998 ; wu 2000 ) .",
    "many plausible explanations have been suggested , e.g. , the triaxiality of galaxy clusters ( morandi et al . 2010 ) , the oversimplification of the strong lensing model for the central mass distributions of clusters ( bartelmann & steinmetz 1996 ) , the inappropriate application of the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis for the central regions of clusters ( wu 1994 ; wu & fang 1997 ) , or the magnetic fields in clusters ( loeb & mao 1994 ) .",
    "recently richard et al . (",
    "2010 ) present a sample of @xmath1 strong lensing clusters taken from the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ) , among which @xmath2 clusters have x - ray data from chandra observations ( sanderson et al .",
    "they show that the x - ray / lensing mass discrepancy is @xmath3 at @xmath4 significance  clusters with larger substructure fractions show greater mass discrepancies , and thus greater departures from hydrostatic equilibrium .    on the other hand , lensing observations of the bullet cluster 1e0657 - 56 ( clowe et al .",
    "2006 ) , combined with earlier x - ray measurements ( markevitch et al .",
    "2006 ) , clearly indicate that the gravitational center of the cluster has an obvious offset from its baryonic center .",
    "furthermore , recent studies ( shan et al . 2010 ) of lensing galaxy clusters reveal that offset between the lensing center and x - ray center appears to be quite common , especially for unrelaxed clusters . among the recent sample of 38 clusters of shan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , @xmath5 have been found to have offsets greater than @xmath6 , and @xmath7 clusters even have offsets greater than @xmath8 .",
    "motivated by such observations , we propose to investigate galaxy cluster models where the center of the dark matter ( dm ) halo does not coincide with the center of the x - ray gas ( see figure  1 ) .    [",
    "fig : offset ]     if the x - ray center of a cluster has an offset from its lensing ( gravitational ) center , then the x - rays and lensing are indeed measuring different regions of the cluster .",
    "given the same radius , the lensing is measuring the dm halo centered at the gravitational center ( shown by the dark blue sphere in figure  1 ) , while the x - rays are measuring the sphere of the halo that is offset from the _ true _ gravitational center ( shown by the red circle in figure  1 ) .",
    "in this case , there will always be a _",
    "natural _ discrepancy between the lensing and x - ray measured masses  or specifically , the x - ray mass will always be lower than the lensing mass , just as the long - standing `` mass discrepancy problem '' has indicated .    in this paper , we investigate the lensing - x - ray mass discrepancy caused by the offsets between dm and x - ray gas . to check our predictions , we compile a sample of @xmath9 clusters with good lensing and x - ray measurements .",
    "we conclude that such `` offset '' effect should not be ignored in our dynamical measurements of galaxy clusters .",
    "a flat @xmath10cdm cosmology is assumed throughout this paper , where @xmath11=0.3 , @xmath12=0.7 , and @xmath13 .",
    "we model our galaxy cluster with a fiducial model as the following : ( 1 ) the dm halo is modeled by the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) with concentration @xmath14 and scaled radius @xmath15 , ( 2 ) the gas distribution is modeled by a @xmath16 model with @xmath17 , the cluster core radius @xmath18 , and the gas fraction @xmath19 , ( 3 ) the mass density of the bcg is described by a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with a velocity dispersion of @xmath20 .",

    "we now calculate the mass ratio @xmath34 , or equivalently , @xmath35 .",
    "figure  2 shows the mass ratio as a function of the 2-d offset @xmath25 , for a typical rich cluster .",

    "the three curves from top to bottom are for the three measuring radii @xmath44 , respectively . from figure  2",
    "we have the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) the lensing measured mass @xmath30 is always higher than the x - ray measured mass @xmath32 . for typical values of offset @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , comparable to the ratio found in early studies ( allen 1998 ; wu 2000 ; richard et al .",

    "we assume that the gas follows the conventional @xmath16 model , i.e. , @xmath76 . in order to compare the mass measured by x - rays with the lensing result",

    "figure  3 shows the relation between the mass ratios @xmath79 and the ( scaled ) offsets for our sample of @xmath9 clusters ( @xmath57 arc images ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the @xmath9 clusters in our sample have quite different sizes and masses .",
    "this can be seen from the wide range of the cluster temperatures  from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",

    "2000 ; xu et al . 2001 ) , and that @xmath83 , where r is the size of the cluster . therefore , in figure  3 , instead of using the physical offset @xmath25 , we use a scaled offset which is characterized by @xmath84 .    from figure  3 ,",
    "the mass ratios @xmath48 exhibits large dispersions  roughly ranging from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "many clusters have large error bars .",

    "we notice that many clusters in the sample have very small offset values  smaller than the errors in lensing and x - ray measurements which are typically a few arcseconds .",
    "so these offset values are not robustly measured themselves , and we thus remove these data points and only focus on clusters with large offsets of @xmath89 , as has been suggested in shan et al .",

    "as has been reported by shan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , it might be fairly common in galaxy clusters that the x - ray center has an obvious offset from the gravitational center .",
    "we have explored the dynamical consequences of this lensing - x - ray offset and tried to attribute such an effect to the long - standing `` mass discrepancy problem '' in galaxy clusters .",
    "our theoretical model predicts that such an offset effect will always result in a larger @xmath30 than @xmath96 , with a typical mass ratio @xmath97 , which is consistent with observations .    to test our model ,",
    "we have compiled a sample of @xmath9 clusters , and studied in detail their lensing and x - ray properties and obtained their lensing and x - ray masses , @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "the lack of strong correlation between @xmath48 and the offset @xmath25 suggests that the problem is more complicated . as we have found in section  2 , @xmath48 is not only a function of @xmath25 , but also depends very strongly on @xmath29 ( or the arc radius @xmath49 ) .",
    "apparently , each cluster in our sample has quite different @xmath49 .",
    "\\(1 ) the central regions of clusters may be still undergoing dynamical relaxation , and the x - ray gas may not be in good hydrostatic equilibrium . therefore , large errors could be induced in the x - ray measurement of cluster cores , especially for unrelaxed clusters .",
    "\\(2 ) the spherical models are too simple to reflect the real mass distribution of clusters",
    ". the use of more realistic mass model could reduce the lens mass within the arc radius by up to @xmath67 , though values of @xmath98 are more typical ( bartelmann 1995 ; allen 1998 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the presence of substructures may complicate our simple spherical lens model , and hence could be a main source of uncertainties in @xmath30 .",
    "the absence of the secondary arc - like images in most arc - cluster systems may indicate the limitations of the spherical mass distribution in the central regions of clusters .",
    "it should be noted that the mass ratios we obtained here are slightly higher than allen ( 1998 ) and wu ( 2000 ) because they unfortunately used a hubble constant of @xmath99 .",
    "the use of @xmath13 here will of course make the mass discrepancy problem more pronounced .",
    "it should be noted that the gas represents only a @xmath100 perturbation due to the small ratio of gas - to - dm in the central region , likewise the offset of the gas is only a small perturbation ( less than @xmath100 ) to the otherwise concentric matter density or potential .",
    "it is unlikely to create a factor of two difference in the lensing - derived enclosed masses within an arc .    to illustrate the lensing effect of the offset perturbation and triaxiality",

    "<S> recent studies of lensing clusters reveal that it might be fairly common for a galaxy cluster that the x - ray center has an obvious offset from its gravitational center which is measured by strong lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that if these offsets exist , then x - rays and lensing are indeed measuring different regions of a cluster , and may thus naturally result in a discrepancy in the measured gravitational masses by the two different methods . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate theoretically the dynamical effects of such lensing - x - ray offsets , and compare with observational data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for typical values , the offset alone can give rise to a factor of two difference between the lensing and x - ray determined masses for the core regions of a cluster , suggesting that such `` offset effect '' may play an important role and should not be ignored in our dynamical measurements of clusters .    </S>",
