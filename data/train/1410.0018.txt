    "while core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are linked both theoretically and observationally to the deaths of massive stars , the exact mapping between the mass of the progenitor and the nature of its death is an unresolved question .",
    "it is yet unknown exactly how the properties of a given star , specifically its mass , will affect the eventual sn type .",
    "archival imaging of progenitor stars has been successful at linking type ii - p sne to red supergiant ( rsg ) stars . however , it is difficult to predict the fate of more massive stars and the progenitors of uncommon types sn types due to their rarity .",
    "significant questions exist as to which mass ranges result in which types of sn , to what extent other properties such as metallicity affect this range , and whether all massive stars actually explode as sn .",
    "@xcite identified what they termed the `` red supergiant problem'' an observed lack of progenitors between 18 and 30 m@xmath6which would be expected to explode as type ii sne .",
    "they postulated that massive stars in this range may fail to explode as sne , ending their lives in some other way .",
    "@xcite compared measured massive star formation rates with the measured ccsn rate and found that twice as many massive stars are formed than explode as ccsne .",
    "they explored a wide variety of explanations for this observation , and found that measurement errors on either rate could not solely explain the discrepancy .",
    "@xcite examined observed rates of different sn types and found it impossible to explain the observed rates of more exotic sne using solely single - star evolution .",
    "@xcite explored the observed compact remnant mass function and found that it could be well - explained by a failed - sn scenario , where some massive stars did not actually produce sne .",
    "together , these recent studies all present evidence suggesting that a model in which all massive stars end their lives as sne through single - star evolutionary channels is an incomplete picture .    having a greater number of progenitor mass measurements naturally makes these issues easier to address .",
    "unfortunately , direct imaging has requirements that limit the frequency with which it may be applied .",
    "since one must directly observe the sn to identify the progenitor in pre - explosion imaging , one is clearly limited by the sn rate in the local universe .",
    "in addition , archival imaging of sufficient depth must exist , nearly always necessitating that the field in question has been previously imaged with either the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc-2 ) , or wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) instruments aboard _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) . as a result of these limitations ,",
    "only @xmath825 sn progenitors currently have mass constraints in the literature , and around half of these are only upper limits @xcite .        0.3 cm        in this work , we employ stellar population analysis as an alternative means of constraining the progenitor mass .",
    "the literature features many examples of using the age of a surrounding stellar population to constrain the progenitor stars of directly observed transients @xcite .",
    "stellar population analysis offers a means of constraining progenitor masses in cases where pre - explosion direct imaging does not exist , as well as a complementary constraint in cases where pre - explosion images of the progenitor are available .    since one does not need to identify the specific progenitor star to determine the likely age of the star formation ( sf ) event that produced the progenitor , one may apply stellar population analysis to the locations of cataloged supernova remnants ( snrs ) , drastically increasing the number of potential progenitor measurements . while sne are typically only visible on time scales of @xmath9 days , snr remain observable for @xmath10 years . assuming a sne rate of @xmath11 yr@xmath12 galaxy@xmath12 @xcite",
    ", one would naively expect to be able to make @xmath8100 progenitor mass estimates per galaxy , provided they are close enough for resolved stellar population analysis . while this approach naturally prevents direct investigation of the sn type , it offers in exchange the leverage to investigate more potential targets .",
    "only a few studies have explored this application so far .",
    "@xcite used the star formation maps of @xcite to estimate progenitor ages and masses for 8 snr in the lmc . in @xcite ( hereafter j12 )",
    ", we identified _",
    "hst_-observed fields coincident with cataloged snr in m31 and analyzed resolved stellar photometry of the surrounding stellar population .",
    "we created color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of these populations and fit them to recover the star formation histories ( sfhs ) . by identifying coeval populations in the sfh",
    ", we assigned likely ages and therefore likely masses to the sn progenitors . our final result consisted of mass estimates for 53 likely ccsn progenitors , which we presented as a mass distribution .",
    "the primary finding in j12 was a paucity of massive stars in the recovered mass distribution when compared to a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests that some fraction of massive stars are not exploding as sne which leave behind observable snr , in agreement with the evidence found in the above studies .",
    "this paper represents several extensions to the work presented in j12 .",
    "first , we more than double the number of total progenitor star mass estimates , improving the statistics on our mass distribution fitting .",
    "we analyze 29 additional snr in m31 for which we have recently acquired new panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( phat ,  @xcite ) data .",
    "second , we have expanded our sample to m33 , an environment with roughly half the metallicity of m31 @xcite , by analyzing 33 additional m33 snr from various archival _ hst _ datasets .",
    "we also verify our result against potential biases due to host galaxy inclination or type . finally , we update our mass distribution fitting method to a probabilistic framework , based on markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques , in which we reliably include our mass uncertainties .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows : in  2 we briefly summarize our technique of mass estimation and discuss the snr catalogs used in this study . in  3 , we present our mass estimations for the additional regions measured in this study . in ",
    "4 we discuss the mass distributions of our snr progenitors .",
    "finally , in  5 , we summarize the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief summary of the main points of our methodology ; the full details of our technique are presented in j12 .",
    "first , we select snrs from catalogs which overlap with _ hst _ fields in m31 and m33 . we limited our search to fields observed with the acs and wfpc-2 instruments , as the optical cmds tend to be deeper and offer the best sfh constraints . for m31 , we combine three snr catalogs to select targets from : @xcite .",
    "all three catalogs make use of [ s  ii]-to - h@xmath13 ratios to identify snr .",
    "our m33 snr catalog comes from @xcite , who selected snrs using both [ s  ii]-to - h@xmath13 ratios and x - ray observations .",
    "@xcite incorporated all previous snr catalogs from the literature in their analysis .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , all new m31 data analyzed in this work come from newly available phat datasets and therefore have uniform filters and exposure times , while the m33 data comes from various archival datasets coincident with snr .",
    "the locations of snr analyzed in this paper and j12 are plotted in fig .  1 . the full list of snr analyzed , including the associated _ hst",
    "_ datasets used , are in table 1 .",
    "we used the photometry pipeline from the acs nearby galaxy treasury program @xcite and the phat program @xcite to perform resolved stellar photometry on all stars in the selected fields .",
    "the full details of how this photometry is performed are provided in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the pipeline uses dolphot @xcite to fit the well - characterized acs point - spread function to all of the point sources in the image .",
    "photometric measurements are then converted to vega magnitudes using zero - points from the acs handbook .",
    "we use fake star tests to assess photometric uncertainties and completeness ; @xmath14 fake stars of known color and magnitude are inserted into the full fields and blindly recovered using the identical software .",
    "we assume distance moduli of 24.47 to m31 @xcite and of 24.69 to m33 @xcite .",
    "typical uncertainties of from these surveys are @xmath80.05 mag for m31 and @xmath80.1 mag for m33 .",
    "we fix the distance moduli to these values for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we found in j12 that it was difficult to constrain older sf events in shallow fields .",
    "we defined the `` depth '' of the field as the point at which photometric completeness dropped below 50% and adopted the same depth cut as j12 for this work .",
    "the values used are @xmath15 for m31 data , shifted to @xmath16 for the m33 fields . in practice ,",
    "nearly all the fields examined in this work have depths significantly below these depth limits , making the precise placement of the cut largely unimportant .",

    "we assume that the progenitor originates from any sf that has occurred in the region over the past 50  myr , where the fraction of stellar mass formed in a given age bin corresponds to the probability that the progenitor star was of that age .",
    "thus , all of our probability distributions sum to one because they include all sf that has occurred over the past 50 myr .",
    "uncertainties on the age estimate may arise either from uncertainties in the cmd fitting process , or from the age spread present in the stellar population .    to characterize uncertainties from fitting , we use a monte carlo ( mc ) technique in which we resample the cmd to account for poisson noise using the match software ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also apply random shifts to the isochrones in temperature , with @xmath33 , and bolometric luminosity , with @xmath34 , during this procedure .",
    "these random shifts are intended to mimic potential uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves .",
    "the magnitude of the luminosity shift is also larger than the uncertainty in the distance , thereby incorporating those uncertainties .",
    "each resampling is then refit using our identical cmd fitting procedure , but with fixed reddening .",
    "these resulting sfhs provide uncertainties on the sf in a given bin . with these uncertainties ,",
    "we calculate a probability distribution for the value of the median age .",
    "we adopt the 16% and 84% range of this distribution as our uncertainty in the median age .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the intrinsic spread of the sfh across multiple age bins .",
    "there are many snr populations in which there are two ( or more ) distinct sf events , and certainly some where a single sf event may spread across two or more adjacent bins . to account for this",
    ", we find the locations where 16% and 84% of the stellar mass was formed and adopt these as our uncertainties due to the spread of sf .",
    "these age - spread uncertainties therefore include an age range that contains 68% of the young stellar mass present in the region .",
    "we add these two sources of uncertainty in quadrature to find our final ( potentially asymmetric ) estimates of uncertainty on the median age .",
    "finally , we argue that we can not truly constrain our progenitors to any better precision that that afforded by the age bins in which we ve performed our cmd fitting . in other words",
    ", we always round our uncertainties to the nearest age bin boundary .    in practice ,",
    "the second source of uncertainty due to the spread of sf across multiple age bins tends to dominate that provided by the random uncertainties in the fitting process .",
    "this is because , while the fitting process may affect the amount of sf found in a given bin , the change in sf must be very large to modify the estimate of the _ median _ age",
    ". the random uncertainty must be enough to significantly change the relative prominence of a preferred burst of sf .",
    "for most of the mc realizations , it is nt , and as a result , the spread of sf tends to be the largest factor .",
    "the final source of uncertainty , which we neglect in determining our final answers , is the conversion from age to mass , which depends on the models applied .",
    "we do not include this uncertainty in our mass tables , as our uncertainties assume the @xcite and @xcite models to be consistent with our sfh fitting as they are used in both processes . in j12",
    ", we estimated that the effects of applying different models for the age / mass conversion would potentially be @xmath80.5 - 1.0 m@xmath6(younger ages have larger uncertainty ) by comparing the predicted masses of @xcite with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , as we have used the @xcite models to derive these ages in the first place , it is not clear that comparing the @xcite masses to those of our chosen isochrones is reflective of the actual data .",
    "we make multiple assumptions in our technique based upon justifications detailed in j12 . in this section",
    ", we briefly review these assumptions and their potential impacts on our conclusions .    first , naturally , in using the surrounding stellar population to infer information about the progenitor star , we are assuming that the two are evolutionarily linked . given that the vast majority of stars form in clusters @xcite with coeval populations , and that that these populations remain spatially associated on 50 pc scales for 50 myr , we expect this to be a reasonable assumption ( see also @xcite ) .    related to this point",
    "is that our methodology is also contingent on the accuracy , completeness , and selection effects of the snr catalogs used .",
    "if the snr catalogs are biased towards one specific type of progenitor or environment , this could bias the overall inferred distribution @xcite and @xcite both consider extinction to be a minor problem .",
    "both studies note that detection biases may exist as a function of the age of the _ remnant _ , but do nt note any biases towards any particular age of the surrounding stellar population . related to this",
    ", we have also assumed that snrs are similarly behaved in different environments . if snrs in differently aged populations had significantly different lifetimes or luminosities , we would naturally be subject to selections effects from this .",
    "we assume for our study that the snr catalogs used are not biased towards any particular progenitor age , and we have included as many snr locations as possible in our analysis .",
    "we note that the consistency of the m33 and m31 results and the consistency between different subsets of the m31 sample , which depend on different snr catalogs .",
    "this suggests that there are not significant selection biases imposed by detection method or survey location .",
    "however , we have no real way to test the second caveat , that snrs from differently aged populations have different lifetimes or detectability thresholds .",
    "we discuss this more in  4.3 .",
    "next , our method provides no information about the type of sn which created the snr . for ccsne",
    ", this ambiguity does nt affect the mass estimation process , since all ccsne are linked to the deaths of massive stars and therefore young stellar populations ( although the mass distribution of progenitors as a function of sn type is certainly an interesting question , we are unable to investigate this with our methodology ) .",
    "we note that there could be contaminants from thermonuclear type ia sne .",
    "however , type ia sne will generally be associated with older stellar populations .",
    "the absence of any recent sf from the cmd analysis will allow one to remove some fraction of these contaminants .",
    "we identified six such snrs with zero recent sf in j12 . in this work ,",
    "we only find one such snr in our new m31 sample ( k413 ) and zero such snrs in our m33 sample .",
    "the new m31 data analyzed in this work essentially all comes from the star forming ring of m31 due to the distribution of the phat survey , so it is not entirely surprising that nearly all fields analyzed return significant recent sf and that nearly all of the sne are ccsne .",
    "the result of all analyzed m33 snr populations having young sf is also likely due to the fact that m33 has a higher sf intensity than m31 .",
    "typical fractions of type ia sne compared to all sne are @xmath825% , although such a figure is dependent on the galaxy type in question @xcite .",
    "we would expect a higher fraction for m31 and a lower fraction for m33 based on morphological distinction .",
    "in addition , there are many reasons to assume that this ia fraction may actually be an upper limit , with a bias resulting from the faintness of type ccsne compared to type ia sne ( see discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , both @xcite and @xcite explicitly note that they will be significantly more biased towards identifying ccsne remnants over type ia remnants due to the spatial distribution of their surveys .",
    "we do not include the m31 bulge in our sample , where most of the ia events would be expected to occur .",
    "thus we actually expect ia sne in our sample to be a significantly smaller fraction than would be expected based on galaxy - wide sn rate studies .",
    "furthermore , in j12 , we demonstrated that our results are robust to inclusion of additional mis - identified type ia sne by removing additional potential contaminants even up to 25% .",
    "we identified those snr - locations with minimal galex fuv flux and removed those objects from our sample .",
    "the resulting progenitor mass distribution was essentially unchanged ( the 95% confidence interval on the power - law exponent changed from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ) .",
    "we conclude that , while there is uncertainty associated with an individual progenitor mass measurement due to the possibility of it being a type ia sne , the overall distributions of progenitor masses are largely robust to the inclusion of a few progenitors with random ages since the vast majority of our snr will be the result of ccsne . in other words , while there are almost certainly some type ia contaminants masquerading as ccsne in our sample , they will be a small number and will not significantly modify the overall conclusions .",
    "finally , our method is contingent on the accuracy of the stellar evolution models used to populate our model cmds .",
    "our cmd - derived sfhs include estimates of these model uncertainties ( see  2.4 ) , although we neglect them during our mass conversion procedure .",
    "it is worth noting that studies of directly identified progenitor stars suffer from similar uncertainties in that they must fit the spectral energy distributions to derive a luminosity and temperature and use stellar evolution models to infer the mass of late - stage massive stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these are thought to be the most uncertain stages of the model predictions .",
    "our approach makes use of the entire cmd , making our results less sensitive to the details of the late - stage stellar evolution models .",
    "examples of the process for mass determinations of m31 snrs can be seen in j12 .",
    "two examples of the fitting process applied to m33 snrs , 20 and 34 , are displayed in fig .",
    "2 and fig .  3 .",
    "the left panel of each plots the observed cmd in red points , with the best - fit model produced by match in grayscale in the background .",
    "the right panel of both displays the cumulative fractional sfh over the past 50 myr for each snr , as fit by match .",
    "the green highlighted region represents the 68% confidence interval for the age and mass estimates .",
    "the mass value is taken from where the cumulative line crosses the 50% cumulative fraction ( marked with a blue line ) , with the upper and lower values given by the 68% confidence interval .",

    "next , for reliable comparisons to models which properly include our uncertainties , we use a more sophisticated maximum - likelihood technique ( adapted from @xcite ) to fit power laws to our progenitor mass distributions .",
    "we use these maximum - likelihood inferred results for all scientific interpretations .",
    "we first use a k - s test to verify consistency of our results with j12 .",
    "our procedure is to take the observed distribution of median masses for the listed segment of our sample and perform a 1-sided k - s comparison to a sample imf , defined as @xmath149 .",
    "values of @xmath13 for which the k - s test returns a @xmath150 chance ( @xmath151 ) of being from the same distribution are defined as being inconsistent with the given mass distribution at 95% confidence . for all imf comparisons",
    ", we integrate the model imf from 7.3  m@xmath6 , the minimum mass value we found in j12 , to 120  m@xmath6 .",
    "the exact selection of maximum mass value does not make a significant difference because very massive stars contributed little to the expected numbers .",
    "the primary result from this analysis is that all of our sample selections ( only m31 , only m33 , and combined ) are inconsistent with a salpeter imf .",
    "the range of power - law indexes that are consistent with our simple median mass distributions according to the k - s test ( @xmath152 ) are 2.44.6 for m33 , 3.84.8 for m31 , and 3.74.3 for the combined sample .",
    "in other words , we have a paucity of massive stars in our progenitor distributions .",
    "we would expect to recover more massive stars if they have been formed following a salpeter imf and all explode as sne .",
    "this finding is consistent with the main result of j12 by expansion to a larger sample , and supports a growing number of other lines of evidence suggesting that not all massive stars explode as sne .",
    "however , because these comparisons do not take into account the uncertainties of our mass estimates , they do not represent a reliable characterization of the range of acceptable power - law indexes .",
    "therefore , while it is encouraging to find consistency between j12 and our new larger samples , we now turn to more sophisticated fitting techniques to determine how well we can characterize the distributions with our current measurements .      to properly include uncertainties in our mass distribution fitting , we adopted a probabilistic framework developed by @xcite to fit a power - law function to our mass distributions .",
    "a full probability distribution for the entire sample is created from the individual mass measurements and uncertainties .",
    "we then fit a power - law distribution using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler _ emcee _",
    "@xcite to sample the posterior distributions .",
    "we then extracted the functional parameters and robust uncertainties from these posterior distributions .",
    "quoted uncertainties correspond to the 16th and 84th percentiles of the probability distributions .",
    "when performing our fitting , we set a prior that m@xmath15320 m@xmath154 , and fixed the minimum mass to 7.3  m@xmath6 .",
    "as an illustration of the distribution of power - law indices , we plot 100 randomly selected mcmc steps in fig .",
    "4 .    we found that we were unable to constrain the maximum mass beyond our prior",
    "if both the mass function slope and the maximum mass were left as free parameters ( all values @xmath15520  m@xmath6were found to be consistent with the data if @xmath156 ) .",
    "therefore , we used two different approaches to fit our distributions .",
    "for one , we assumed the distribution followed a power - law function of the form @xmath157 , with @xmath13 left as a free parameter and with @xmath158 fixed to 90 m@xmath6 .",
    "we also performed an mcmc run in which we fixed the functional form of the mass function to be a salpeter imf , @xmath21 , as one may expect to recover if all massive stars produce sne . in these fits ,",
    "@xmath159 was constrained by the data .",
    "@xcite explicitly notes that a meaningful limit on the maximum mass can not be constrained by the data beyond simply returning the most massive star observed , so we emphasize that fit values for @xmath159 in particular should be considered illustrative .",
    "the precise values are not necessarily meaningful , whereas the fits for a free slope are more reliable .",
    "the results from these fits are listed in table 5 .",
    "we do not attempt to evaluate which model description is a better fit to the data .",
    "there is evidence that the regions of progenitor masses over which sne may explode may actually be quite complex ( e.g. @xcite ) , making either parametrization of the mass distribution a likely oversimplification .",
    "however , the result of a paucity of massive progenitors is robust regardless of model selection .",
    "the use of the mcmc technique properly incorporates our measured uncertainties and rules out a salpeter mass function for our progenitor sample .",

    ". while this range in power - law indices is still large , the distributions are all still steeper than salpeter regardless . a more precise comparison of the m31 and m33 distributions would naturally be interesting , but we are unable to make a more constraining statement than this given the current size of the dataset and the uncertainties involved .",
    "both the individual m31 and m33 progenitor mass distributions , as well as the full progenitor mass distribution , are steeper than a salpeter imf with at least 95% confidence , regardless of the method used to fit the distribution .",
    "thus , both the full sample and the individual m31 and m33 distributions display a paucity of massive stars compared to a simple model imf .",
    "if we assume that a salpeter distribution is a reasonable description of the massive star population , then this paucity suggests that some fraction of massive stars are not in our snr progenitor sample .",
    "recent theoretical and observational work has suggested that in certain mass ranges , massive stars may not undergo sn explosions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our observation is consistent with the interpretation that there are certain mass ranges in the massive star population in which stars fail to end their lives as ccsn .",
    "one important caveat is that the interpretation of an observed upper - mass ccsne cutoff relies on sampling an unbiased population of massive stars , _ i.e. _  that our snr catalogs are unbiased to any one type of progenitor star environment .",
    "since we would expect higher - mass progenitors to be preferentially found in more - extincted regions , this may cause snr from higher - mass progenitors to be systematically under - sampled in snr catalogs . we have now expanded the sample to include snr from m33 , which is less inclined to our line of sight and lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "both of these qualities should reduce the amount of extinction , somewhat reducing these biases .",
    "however , we also note that a commonly - used method for identifying snrs is by their high [ s  ii]/h@xmath13 flux ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the youngest regions will have more photoionized hii , increasing the h@xmath13 flux and making snr identification more difficult .",
    "we made some attempt to reduce this bias by incorporating snr catalogs that use different methodology .",
    "in particular , the @xcite m33 snr catalog incorporates observations from radio to x - ray to catalog snrs . in any case ,",
    "given that snrs do not stand out if they are located within a photo - ionized ism , we are currently unable to definitively distinguish between the possibility of snrs from more - massive progenitors being more difficult to identify , and very high - mass stars not producing sne .",
    "in addition to difficulties in detection due to obscuration , any inherent differences in luminosity or lifetime of snrs as a function of progenitor mass could also introduce some bias .",
    "these properties are dependent upon both the energy of the sn and the density of the medium into which the snr expands . if one would appeal to this as an explanation for the lack of high mass progenitors",
    ", this would imply that snr from higher mass stars have inherently lower luminosities and/or inherently shorter lifetimes . at present",
    ", we have no real ability to test either of these cases with our methodology .",
    "if there are significant differences in snr frequencies or properties as a function of progenitor mass , then naturally we are no longer dealing with an unbiased sample of all exploded massive stars , and our conclusions about the sne progenitor mass distribution are weakened .",
    "in this work , we estimated progenitor masses of 33 snr in m33 and 29 snr in m31 using identical methodology to @xcite . after combining these with the 53 ccsne progenitor mass estimates from j12 ,",
    "we constrain the progenitor distributions with a probabilistic technique which incorporates the uncertainties on the individual progenitor mass estimates .",
    "we find that the progenitor mass distributions of m31 and m33 both display a paucity of massive stars when compared to a salpeter imf .",
    "this suggests that some fraction of massive stars are not exploding as sne , a similar finding to that seen in other theoretical and observational work @xcite .",
    "our work represents an independent and complementary technique to these other methods .",
    "now that the result has been expanded to m33 , we have verified that this result holds across a range of galaxy inclination , metallicity , and morphology .",
    "however , we note that due to potential biases in the snr catalogs , we can not rule out the possibility that the snr surveys have preferentially missed the snrs of more massive sn progenitors .",
    "in addition to this main result , we have also investigated other interesting properties of the progenitor mass distributions . assuming a salpeter imf is the expected distribution if all massive stars produce sne , we estimated the upper - mass cutoff necessary to be consistent with our data .",
    "the data from both galaxies are consistent with a maximum mass for core - collapse sne of @xmath166 m@xmath6 .",
    "we also compare the progenitor mass distributions of m33 and m31 , finding them to be consistent with one another , albeit to within large uncertainties . at this stage",
    ", we believe we have examined all available archival _ hst",
    "_ data of sufficient depth to apply our stellar population analysis techniques in m31 and m33 .",
