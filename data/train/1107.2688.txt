    "the soft diffractive processes at the large hadron collider , lhc , are important for understanding non - perturbative qcd effects and they also constitute a significant fraction of the total proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) cross - section @xcite . therefore , the measurement of the main characteristics of diffractive interactions are essential to improve our understanding of @xmath0 collisions .",
    "however , the modelling of diffraction is still mainly generator dependent and there is no unique , agreed upon , experimental definition of diffraction [ 3 , 10 ] . while the physics of diffractive dissociation at the lhc is very important , the detector capabilities in the forward region are limited . in this paper",
    ", we study the methods to select soft diffraction dissociation by considering the forward rapidity coverage of the lhc experiments atlas and cms @xcite .",
    "in proton - proton ( or more generally hadron - hadron ) scattering , interactions can be classified as either elastic or inelastic by the characteristic signatures of the final states .",
    "furthermore , it is conventional to divide inelastic processes into diffractive and non - diffractive parts . in the theoretical concept , hadronic diffractive dissociation",
    "is principally explained to be mediated by the exchange of the pomeron , which carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum ; thus , the initial and final states in the scattering process have the same quantum numbers . if the pomeron exchange process is additionally associated with a hard scattering ( such as the production of jets , b - quark , w boson etc ) , the process known as hard diffractive , otherwise it s soft diffractive dissociation .",
    "introductory reviews on the area can be found in refs .",
    "diffractive events at hadron colliders can be classified into the following categories ; single , double diffractive dissociation and central diffraction ( a.k.a . ``",
    "double pomeron exchange '' ) , with higher order `` multi pomeron '' processes @xcite .",
    "thus , the total proton - proton cross - section can be written as the following series @xmath4 where nd is non - diffractive processes , sdd ( ddd ) is single ( double ) diffraction dissociation , dpe corresponds to the double pomeron exchange and mpe refers to the multi pomeron exchange .",
    "diffractive processes together with the elastic scattering represent about 50% of the total @xmath0 cross - section @xcite .    in single diffractive dissociation one of the incoming protons dissociates into a `` low mass '' system ( a system of particles with low invariant mass w.r.t .",
    "the centre of mass energy of the collision ) while in double diffractive dissociation both of the incoming protons dissociates into `` low mass '' systems as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] .    )",
    "is exchanged in a @xmath0 collision . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the invariant masses of the dissociated systems @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . in single diffractive dissociation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the intact proton .",
    "@xmath11 refers to the size of the large rapidity gap.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=68.0% ] +    diffractive events are classified by a large gap in the pseudorapidity distribution of final state particles .",
    "the large rapidity gap can be defined as the difference between the rapidity of the diffractively scattered proton and that of the particle closest to it in ( pseudo)rapidity . however , the existing atlas and cms detectors are not well suited for measuring the forward rapidity gaps .",
    "therefore , from the experimental point of view , rapidity gaps should be defined by a total absence of particles in a particular interval of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "the large rapidity gap , @xmath11 , is the largest rapidity gap between those rapidity gaps in a final state and determines the type of the diffraction process .",
    "in single diffractive collisions , one of the two incident protons emits a pomeron and remains intact by loosing a few percent of its initial longitudinal momentum .",
    "the fractional longitudinal momentum loss of the intact proton is related to the momentum fraction taken by the pomeron ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the final and @xmath14 is the initial longitudinal momentum of the proton .",
    "the pomeron scatters with the other beam proton and the proton dissociates into a system of particles with low invariant mass , @xmath5 .",
    "ddd processes are described by the invariant masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the dissociation systems @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : events ] .",
    "the fractional longitudinal momentum loss of the proton can be determined by measuring the invariant mass of the dissociated system(s ) given as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the center - of - mass energy for proton - proton collisions . in the following ,",
    "the convention @xmath17 is adopted and @xmath18 is referred to as @xmath19 .",
    "there are several other approaches to determine @xmath19 experimentally .",
    "one of the methods is to detect the scattered proton by using e.g roman pots  @xcite and to measure the final momentum of the proton .",
    "the fractional longitudinal momentum loss @xmath19 can also be reconstructed by using the final state particles as shown in the following equation .",
    "@xmath20    where @xmath21 is the transverse energy and @xmath22 is the pseudorapidity of the @xmath23 particle",
    ". we do not consider this way of calculating @xmath19 in this paper .",
    "the mass of the diffractive system can be measured experimentally by summing up the masses of all final state particles in the dissociated system as given in the following .",
    "@xmath24    however , it is not possible to make a precise measurement throughout the whole pseudo - rapidity range due to the lack of the detector coverage in the very forward regions .",
    "therefore , one can expect some difference between the measured mass of the diffractive system and the actual mass .",
    "this difference is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : generatedxi ] for single diffractive events simulated by pythia8.142 . as shown in the figure , the diffractive mass calculated in the limited rapidity range , @xmath25 , does not match the generated diffractive mass since we are not able to measure the whole mass of the dissociated system .",
    "coverage ( green line ) and in a limited @xmath26 coverage @xmath25 ( blue line).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0% ] +    it is clear that the wider the range of rapidity covered , the more accurately the diffractive mass can be determined .",
    "since some of the final state particles can dissociate into the very forward rapidities , it seems not possible to measure the actual mass of the diffractive system within the limited rapidity range @xmath27 which is the nominal rapidity coverage of the cms experiment without very forward detectors castor and zdc @xcite .",
    "the gap signature in diffractive dissociation has been observed in the previous hadron - hadron collision experiments @xcite .",
    "the type of diffractive processes can be determined by looking at the number of large rapidity gaps and the position of them in the rapidity space .",
    "single diffractive dissociation processes are characterised by an edge ( forward ) gap only at one side of the detector while the double diffractive dissociation processes are characterised by a central gap in the central pseudorapidity region of the detector .    the large rapidity gap in an event and the @xmath19 variable , are closely related to each other . in sdd case , the pseudorapidity difference between the intact proton and the x system is given as @xmath11 @xmath28 -ln@xmath19 .",
    "if we experimentally measure the size of the large rapidity gap or the invariant mass of the dissociated system , we can determine the fractional longitudinal momentum loss of the proton .",
    "the measurements of the diffractive processes can be done based on the determination of the size of the large rapidity gap , @xmath11 , and the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath19 can be used . however , due to the forward acceptance limitations of the atlas and cms detectors , it is not possible to measure the gaps in the very forward rapidities or the whole size of the actual gap in some cases .",
    "it is therefore important to study the kinematical variables of the diffractive processes within the detector limits where the experimental measurements will be performed .",
    "[ fig : diffmass ] shows the relation between the size of the large rapidity gap @xmath11 , and @xmath29 for single diffractive dissociated events .    in this paper",
    ", we use the relation @xmath30 for the calculation of @xmath19 .",
    "first , we consider the whole pseudorapidity range and find the largest gap in an event .",
    "all the particles with the pseudorapidity less than ( or equal to ) the lower boundary of the gap are considered in one system and the rest are in the other .",
    "then , we add the four vectors of all particles in the given system to get the invariant mass and thus @xmath19 .",

    "methods to select soft diffraction dissociation at the lhc experiments atlas and cms are studied by using large rapidity gaps in the events .",
    "it is shown that the larger the rapidity covered , the more precisely measurements for diffractive dissociated events can be done . in the limited detector rapidity coverage @xmath27 , one can select a sample of events of which 98.8% are diffractive dissociated , according to pythia8 , by requiring an edge gap with a gap size @xmath38 3 and with a cut of @xmath36 200 mev for all final state particles . however , with this event selection , 42.1% of the diffractive dissociated events will be double diffractive dissociated events and it seems not possible to separate sdd from ddd events with a low diffractive mass by using edge gaps .",
    "central gaps look like a better candidate in order to try to distinguish sdd and ddd events , however , only a small fraction of ddd events have a central gap . although the very forward detectors , zdc , can provide a better distinction for the sdd and ddd events , it still seems not possible to select a pure sample of sdd events within the detector limits . since it is not possible to make an unambiguous distinction between sdd and ddd events with the limited rapidity coverage of the detector , @xmath27 , we should not attempt to make a measurement of sdd production .",
    "it is preferable to measure the rapidity gap cross - section for all types of process , without attempting to correct for ddd events .",
    "also , due to the limited tracker range @xmath40 , a primary vertex requirement in the event selection is not practical to perform measurements for diffractive dissociated events .",
    "particularly , very low mass soft diffractive events which dissociate into the very forward rapidities and have a gap with a size of @xmath38 8 , are suppressed by the primary vertex requirement .",
