    "the kondo effect,@xcite a well - known feature of magnetic impurity systems , has seen a tremendous renewed interest due to the realization of quantum dots and nanoscale systems.@xcite the existence of kondo correlations at low temperatures @xmath0 has been firmly established in numerous experiments on quantum dots,@xcite molecules,@xcite and carbon nanotubes.@xcite the interaction of an impurity spin with itinerant electrons , causing the kondo effect , manifests itself in spatially extended spin - spin correlations  the kondo screening cloud .",
    "these correlations have been extensively studied in theory@xcite and many proposals for experimentally measuring the kondo screening cloud have been put forward.@xcite also , several studies have emphasized the emergence of mesoscopic fluctuations on finite systems , and the existence of even - odd effects in the kondo cloud when computed from a lattice model.@xcite while there has been experimental progress toward the measurement of the kondo cloud,@xcite the detection of the spin - spin correlations has proven to be highly challenging and has not been accomplished so far .",
    "depending on the kondo temperature @xmath1 , the kondo cloud can have a significant extension of @xmath2.@xcite    in our work , we examine the spin - spin correlations in a real - space model , the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) that includes charge fluctuations , using the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg).@xcite we address two main questions : first , we compute the spin - spin correlations between the impurity spin and the conduction electrons at particle - hole symmetry and discuss how the kondo screening length @xmath3 can be directly extracted from such data . to that end",
    ", we discuss several ways of collapsing spin - spin correlations calculated for different kondo temperatures onto a universal curve . in this analysis , we employ ideas suggested by gubernatis _",
    "et al._@xcite that have also been used in previous dmrg studies of the kondo cloud problem.@xcite we find that from chains of about @xmath4 sites , suitable measures for the @xmath5 screening length can be extracted for kondo temperatures of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the tunneling rate ) .",
    "knowledge of the universal curve further allows us to estimate @xmath8 even for kondo temperatures for which the accessible system sizes are too small to host the full kondo cloud . as a main result of our analysis",
    ", we find that our measures of @xmath8 extracted from the spin - spin correlations have the same functional dependence on model parameters as @xmath9 , @xmath10 at particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath11 is the fermi velocity in the leads , we adopt @xmath12 throughout the rest of this work ) .",
    "the screening length @xmath13 governs the finite - size scaling of local quantities such as the polarization or the magnetic moment.@xcite    second , we consider several mechanisms that destroy kondo correlations , namely a gate voltage and a magnetic field applied to the quantum dot .",
    "we study the changes in the screening length induced by a variation in these parameters .",
    "we argue that computing the magnetic field dependence of the screening length provides a means of extracting the kondo temperature .",
    "the emergence of an exponentially small energy scale in the kondo problem , namely @xmath14 , restricts any real - space approach with respect to the kondo temperatures that can be accessed .",
    "a powerful framework was introduced by wilson@xcite in the form of the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method,@xcite which is explicitly tailored toward the kondo problem .",
    "this is achieved through the introduction of a logarithmic energy discretization that allows the kondo scale to be resolved but loses real space information .",
    "recently , an nrg method has been developed to access spatially resolved quantities,@xcite extending some older nrg calculations for spatially dependent correlation functions.@xcite using the more recent nrg approach,@xcite the spin correlations between the impurity and the sites in the leads have been computed for the kondo model , and it has been shown that at the kondo screening length @xmath9 , the envelope of the correlations crosses over from a @xmath15 decay at distances @xmath16 to a @xmath17 decay at distances @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the distance between the impurity and a site in the leads .    comparing nrg and dmrg , first , there are technical differences between dmrg and nrg with respect to how the spin - spin correlations @xmath20 ( @xmath21 denotes a spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath22 ) are obtained .",
    "nrg requires a separate run for each pair of indices @xmath23 , whereas dmrg operates directly on real - space leads .",
    "that way , after calculating the ground state for a system of a given length , all correlations can be evaluated in a single run . while the use of real - space chains is restricted to one dimension , which is the case of interest in our work , nrg in principle works for higher dimensions too .",
    "second , using dmrg , we can gain direct and easy information on the finite - size scaling of spin - spin correlations , which we heavily exploit in our analysis .",
    "most importantly , dmrg can also be applied to quantum - impurity problems with interacting leads@xcite that nrg is not designed for .",
    "dmrg has previously been used to study the kondo cloud in several papers , for both the single - impurity anderson model @xcite and the kondo model.@xcite in ref .   by hand _",
    ", in particular , an interesting relation between the screening length as extracted from the spin correlations and the weight of the kondo resonance has been discussed .",
    "our study extends the dmrg literature as we consider the mixed - valence regime , the effect of a magnetic field , and we discuss and demonstrate the universal scaling of spin - spin correlations for a wide range of parameters .",
    "moreover , in the absence of a magnetic field , we exploit the su(2 ) symmetry of the model in the spin sector in the dmrg simulations , which we find is crucial for efficiently obtaining reliable numerical results .    besides the conceptual interest in understanding the scaling properties of the kondo screening length with both system size and kondo temperature , our results are relevant to gauge the range of validity of numerical approaches for calculating the conductance of nanostructures that employ a real - space representation of the leads such as time - dependent dmrg simulations of transport in the single - impurity anderson model.@xcite moreover , the approaches discussed here to extract the screening length could be applicable to more complex geometries in a straightforward way , for instance , to multichannel and/ or multidot problems .",

    "the width of the dot level due to the hybridization with the lead is given by @xmath38 .    in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", this model has a spin su(2 ) symmetry . in our analysis , we calculate the ground state of this system via dmrg using an implementation exploiting the su(2 ) symmetry which greatly improves the efficiency @xcite ( see the appendix for more detail ) .",
    "a typical run for @xmath4 sites with @xmath39 states took about 60 h on a 2.6  ghz opteron cpu .",
    "all simulations , irrespective of @xmath40 , are performed at half - filling of the full system . as the kondo scale depends exponentially on @xmath41 , while in a real - space representation of the leads ,",
    "the energy resolution is proportional to @xmath42 , we restrict our analysis to the intermediate values of @xmath43 .",
    "the tradeoff for these limitations is that it is straightforward to calculate spin correlators , as outlined below [ see eq .  ] .    throughout this work ,",
    "we use chains with an overall _ even _ number of sites .",
    "it is well - known that there are significant even - odd effects in impurity problem of this kind.@xcite earlier work ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .  )",
    ", suggests that the convergence with system size toward a kondo state is much faster on chains with an even number of sites .",
    "we thus work in singlet subspaces .",
    "in this section , we present our results for the spin - spin - correlation function at particle - hole symmetry and we discuss two ways of collapsing the data , allowing for a determination of the kondo screening length .     [ from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - int - corr ] ) ] for systems of different sizes at @xmath45 and @xmath46 . as an example , the threshold of @xmath47 that we use in eq .   to extract @xmath48",

    "this definition is motivated by the following convenient properties : ( i ) the decay of @xmath54 with @xmath19 characterizes the extent to which the total spin of chain sites one to @xmath19 is able to screen the spin on the impurity level , _",

    "( iv ) in the absence of a magnetic field , @xmath62 is su(2 ) invariant , such that this symmetry can be exploited in our numerics . in the presence of a magnetic field , we shall use a symmetry - broken version , replacing @xmath63 by @xmath64 .    as an example",
    ", the inset of shows a dmrg result for the absolute value of the bare spin - spin correlator @xmath65 .",
    "the feature at @xmath66 is a simple effect of the open boundary conditions .",
    "the spin correlations for @xmath22 smaller than a certain value ( here roughly @xmath66 ) oscillate between negative and positive , while beyond a certain point , all @xmath65 become positive .",
    "this feature at @xmath66 precisely appears at the site where this happens , _",
    "i.e. _ , where @xmath65 with @xmath22 even changes its sign and , as a consequence , the correlator passes arbitrarily close through zero . summing up the correlator according to eq",
    ".   yields @xmath62 , plotted in the main panel .",
    "the notion of a screening length is based on the premise that the decay of @xmath62 follows a universal form characterized by a single length scale , @xmath8 , as long as this scale is significantly shorter than the system size , @xmath67 .",
    "( according to the expectation that @xmath68 , this condition is equivalent to the following statement : perfect spin screening in a system of finite size @xmath69 can only be achieved if the level spacing , which scales like @xmath70 , is smaller than @xmath1 . ) whenever this condition is not met , the shape of the decay of @xmath62 with @xmath19 deviates from its universal form once @xmath19 becomes large enough such that the finite system size makes itself felt [ via the boundary condition @xmath57 ] . to extract @xmath8 from dmrg data obtained for finite - sized systems ,",
    "we thus need a strategy for dealing with this complication .",
    "below , we shall describe two different approaches that accomplish this , both involving a scaling analysis .    to check whether the screening length obtained using either of the two scaling strategies conforms to the theoretical expectations , we shall check whether its dependence on the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath7 , and @xmath40 agrees with that of the length scale @xmath72 [ eq .  ] . using the known form of the kondo temperature @xmath1 for the anderson model,@xcite this dependence",

    "first , the @xmath62 data are nonmonotonic in @xmath69 , due to the fact that the sign of @xmath82 oscillates , and for curves scaled by different values of @xmath3 , the oscillations are stretched by different amounts on a semilog plot .",
    "this introduces some `` noise '' to the @xmath62 curves , making it somewhat difficult to decide when the scaling collapse is optimal .",
    "second , for some parameter combinations , the condition @xmath67 is not met , and therefore , perfect scaling can not be expected for all the curves .",
    "these issues can be dealt with by a two - step strategy : ( i ) we start with the curves , which collapse the best , namely , those with the smallest @xmath41 ratios .",
    "these yield the smallest @xmath3 values and hence satisfy the condition @xmath83 required for good scaling well enough such that the shape of the universal scaling curve can be established unambiguously ( to the extent allowed by the aforementioned noise ) .",
    "( ii ) we then proceed to larger ratios of @xmath41 , which yield larger @xmath3 , and adjust @xmath3 such that a good collapse of @xmath62 vs.  @xmath77 onto the universal curve is achieved in the regime of small @xmath77 , where finite - size effects are not yet felt .",
    "thus , knowledge of the universal scaling curve allows @xmath3 to be extracted even when the condition @xmath84 is not fully met .",
    "the result of such a scaling analysis is shown in ( a ) .",
    "a universal scaling curve can clearly be discerned , with deviations from scaling evident in the curves with large @xmath41 , as expected . moreover , ( b ) shows that the results for @xmath8 extracted from @xmath62 scaling agree rather well with the parameter dependence expected from eq .",

    "no well - defined local moment will form and the premise for eq .",
    "( [ eq : kondo - scale ] ) no longer holds .",
    "a second strategy for extracting the screening length , following refs .  , and  , is to determine the length , say @xmath89 , on which the integrated spin - correlation function @xmath62 has dropped by a factor of @xmath90 of its @xmath91 value ( for instance ,  @xmath92 would signify a 90% screening of the local spin ) .",
    "thus , we define @xmath93 the argument of @xmath94 serves as a reminder that this length depends on @xmath69 , since the boundary condition @xmath57 always enforces perfect screening for @xmath95 .",
    "however , once the system size becomes sufficiently large @xmath96 to accommodate the full screening cloud , @xmath94 approaches a limiting value , to be denoted by @xmath89 [ shorthand for @xmath97 , which may be taken as a measure of the true screening length @xmath8 .",
    "this is illustrated in the main panel of for @xmath92 : as @xmath69 increases , the @xmath19-values , where the @xmath62 curves cross the threshold @xmath98 ( horizontal dashed line ) , tend to a limiting value .",

    "this , however , has no qualitative influence on the scaling collapse described by eq .  .",
    "we suggest that an analysis analogous to the one presented in could be used to extract @xmath14 for models in which the dependence of @xmath14 on model parameters is not known .",

    "[ sec : spin - correlations ] and one would obtain @xmath14 up to an unknown prefactor , which is independent of @xmath41 .    by rescaling the magnetic moment data to @xmath149 as shown in the inset of ( c ) we again find a universal curve very similar to the collapse of @xmath146 in ( b ) .",
    "we thus confirm that a collapse of local quantities can be used to extract @xmath14 , as previously shown using dmrg.@xcite in principle , both a scaling analysis of @xmath160 and @xmath163 can be used to extract @xmath14 . using the analysis of the screening length data ( @xmath3 ) offers the possibility of a scaling analysis as outlined in sec .",

    "moreover , the analysis of @xmath8 directly unveils the relevant length scales .",
    "in this work , we studied the spin - spin correlations in the single - impurity anderson impurity model using a state - of - the - art implementation of the density matrix renormalization group method .",
    "we first considered the particle - hole symmetric point and discussed two ways of collapsing the system - size - dependent data onto universal scaling curves to extract a measure of the kondo cloud s extension , the screening length @xmath8 , as a function of @xmath43 , or @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the first analysis is based on a scaling collapse of the integrated correlations , while the second one employs a finite - size scaling analysis of the distance @xmath94 from the impurity at which a certain fraction @xmath90 of the impurity s magnetic moment is screened .",
    "@xmath164 exhibits a universal dependence on @xmath165 , independently of the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "we further showed that for an appropriately chosen value of the parameter @xmath90 , both approaches yield quantitatively similar estimates of the screening length .",
    "our results for @xmath8 , obtained from either of the scaling analyses , nicely follow the expected dependence on @xmath43 .",
    "as dmrg works in real space , the scaling regime could only be reached for @xmath166 and system sizes of @xmath167 , but even for larger @xmath168 , a collapse onto the universal behavior could be achieved .",
    "note that @xmath169 is the regime , in which time - dependent dmrg is able to capture kondo correlations in real - time simulations of transport@xcite on comparable system sizes , consistent with our observations .",
    "while nrg is better suited to access the regime of very small kondo temperatures @xmath1 , dmrg efficiently gives access to the full correlation function @xmath170 in a single run . as an outlook onto future applications",
    ", we emphasize that dmrg allows for the calculation of the spin - spin correlations in the case of interacting leads@xcite or out - of - equilibrium , which is challenging if not impossible for other numerical approaches with current numerical resources .    while the first part of our study focused on the particle - hole symmetric point where kondo physics is dominant , we have further analyzed how the screening cloud is affected ( i ) by varying the gate voltage and tuning the system into the mixed - valence regime , and ( ii ) by applying a magnetic field at particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the latter provides an independent measure of the kondo temperature , through the universal dependence of the screening length on @xmath171 .    _",
    "note added : _ while finalizing this work , we became aware of a related effort on the kondo cloud , ref .",

    "the dmrg calculations presented in this work are challenging for two reasons .",

    "second , the spin - spin correlators are long - ranged quantities making very accurate calculations of quantities necessary that are small compared to the unit of energy , @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter controlling the accuracy of our calculations is the number of states @xmath179 used to approximate the ground state during the dmrg sweeps .",
    "typically , we choose @xmath180 ( 3000 at most ) for the calculation of the ground state .",
    "this results in a residual norm per site,@xcite a measure for the quality of the convergence of the calculated ground state towards an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , @xmath181 , on the order @xmath182 .",

    ". for comparison , we add the @xmath184 data , represented by the open triangles , from calculations exploiting the su(2 ) symmetry ( @xmath39 states kept ) .",
    "the calculation with a magnetic field ( symbols connected with lines ) uses the u(1 ) symmetry only ( @xmath185 states kept from right to left ) .",

    "the larger the ratio @xmath41 and the bigger the system size @xmath69 , the higher the number of states @xmath179 , needed to be kept to obtain a well - converged ground state , see .",
    "this can be understood as follows : higher @xmath41 implies a smaller kondo temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , a larger screening length @xmath48 and longer - ranged spin - spin correlators @xmath102 .",
    "a well - converged ground state requires these to be evaluated accurately over the entire range @xmath186 , and hence more states need to be kept during the dmrg sweeps . for the scaling analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin - correlations ] ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : sigma - fit ] and [ fig : xi - fit ] ) , we only used data points that are converged with respect to the number of states kept .    in , we illustrate that the convergence with the number of states is greatly accelerated whenever the su(2 ) symmetry can be exploited .",
    "we compare this preferable case to the calculations with a magnetic field , where the su(2 ) symmetry is reduced to a u(1 ) symmetry . in the figure",
    ", we use a small magnetic field of @xmath187 , such that the results for @xmath188 coincide with the results for @xmath184 , previously obtained from the su(2 ) calculation .",
    "for instance , at @xmath4 by keeping @xmath39 states , @xmath189 is reached in the u(1 ) case as compared to @xmath190 for the su(2 ) case . for @xmath104 , @xmath191",
    ", we show that this residual norm ensures accurate data for @xmath122 up to @xmath128 , while for larger @xmath90 , our u(1 ) results are well below the corresponding su(2 ) ones computed with the same @xmath179 .    pragmatically , in the case of broken su(2 ) symmetry , one may resort to using a smaller threshold @xmath90 ( instead of @xmath128 ) , for which the convergence with @xmath179 is faster .",
    "as we have shown in , @xmath3 can be extracted from @xmath122 with @xmath192 up to a nonuniversal prefactor using the schemes discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin - correlations ] .",
    "in contrast to the screening length , the calculation of the magnetic moment @xmath154 , a local quantity , is much better behaved .",
