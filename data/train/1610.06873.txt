    "this document is organized as follows : we first provide a derivation of the toner - tu equations  @xcite introduced in the main text by building on conservation laws and symmetry principles .",

    "we then establish a rigorous analogy between the effect of spontaneous active flow on density waves and the effect of a gauge field on the wave function of a charged quantum particle .",
    "finally , we show how a scaling analysis of the equation for density waves leads to an estimate for the penetration depth of a topological edge state in an active metamaterial .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of a _ passive _ polar liquid take into account three slow variables : the usual density , @xmath51 , and velocity , @xmath52 fields , as well as a broken - symmetry field , the polarization @xmath53 , defined as the local average of the particle orientations . the first ( continuity ) equation reflects mass conservation and includes a diffusive term @xmath54 .",

    "( [ eq : v ] ) reduces to a constraint equation , @xmath57 , and the hydrodynamics is fully captured by mass conservation and the dissipative dynamics of the polarization field .",
    "a gradient expansion of @xmath58 then yields  @xcite : @xmath59 where all of the hydrodynamic coefficients depends _ a priori _ on the local density .",
    "note that whereas for a system with galilean invariance , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for the polar active liquid , which lacks this symmetry , these parameters may be arbitrary . studies of realistic microscopic models have found @xmath7 to be positive , less than , and of order @xmath62 , and for the numerical computations performed in this work , we assume @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "the lack of galilean invariance as well as momentum conservation leads to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 terms in eq .",

    "( [ eq : massconservation2],[eq : a - b2 ] ) are sufficient to capture the phenomena associated with linear density waves in a polar active liquid relevant to our analysis . in that limit",
    ", the polarization field itself defines the fluid velocity , so that the coupling between the polarization field and the density gradient has an effect analogous to that of a pressure gradient in an equilibrium liquid .      for the case",
    "@xmath66 , the toner - tu equations result in a steady state of the fluid with spontaneous flow in the bulk , such that @xmath67 .",
    "although in the bulk , the spontaneous flow direction @xmath68 could be arbitrary , in physical realizations of active liquids , the boundaries fix @xmath68 . for example , in an open channel , @xmath68 is parallel to the channel walls . in the lieb lattice geometry ,",
    "we have solved eqs .",
    "( [ eq : massconservation2 ] ) and ( [ eq : a - b2 ] ) for a sufficient time for the dynamics to relax to a steady state .",
    "we find that this steady state , plotted in fig .",
    "1a ( also see  [ figs2 ] ) , has the features of the spatial profile observed from our particle - based simulations , although the particle - based simulations lead to a smoother profile , fig .",
    "1b .    in the analysis performed for the density wave computations ,",
    "we take a particularly simple form of the steady state , based on the profile we observe .",
    "we postulate the polarization has magnitude unity everywhere and is oriented azimuthally , i.e. , perpendicular to the vector connecting the position of the fluid to the nearest annulus center . in the regions of overlap between annuli , we linearly interpolate between the two annular flow profiles . this spatial profile is plotted in a large sample in fig .",
    "3a of the main text .",
    "thus , given a spontaneous steady - state flow field @xmath69 , we expand @xmath15 and @xmath16 to find @xmath70 for the case of propagating waves , the right - hand side can be decomposed as the sum of a dominant anti - hermitian matrix that governs wave dispersion and a perturbatively small hermitian matrix that governs wave attenuation .",
    "as we are interested in the behavior of an active fluid deep in the ordered phase , we have assumed @xmath9 to be constant .",
    "the @xmath14 dependance of @xmath9 , which leads to additional dissipative terms , would be most significant near the phase transition from an isotropic to a flowing steady state .",
    "there are two notable differences for the propagation of density waves in an active liquid compared to a simple fluid : ( 1 ) the @xmath9 term acts as an additional dissipative term for sound in an active liquid , and ( 2 ) one of the convection terms contains the coefficient @xmath7  ( @xmath71 ) . due to this second difference , the equation of motion can no longer be `` galilean boosted '' into a different reference frame by replacing the lab - frame derivative @xmath72 by a convective derivative .    to closely examine the mode structure in eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : ac - br - ph ] ) , we split the vector @xmath73 into components @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively parallel and perpendicular to @xmath68 .",
    "note that due to the confinement of the active liquid inside a channel , we can assume that the density waves only propagate along the channel and , therefore , the derivatives of @xmath11 and @xmath14 along the direction perpendicular to @xmath68 can be ignored . under this assumption , eqs .",

    "the frequency is then given by @xmath78 ( also see fig .",
    "whereas the real component of @xmath79 governs the propagation of sound waves , the imaginary component governs their dissipation . due to spontaneous flow , the sound wave frequency may",

    "thus , in the regime @xmath81 , there exist longitudinal density waves that propagate and decay slowly in the ordered active liquid .",
    "provided we are in this regime , for phenomena on sufficiently short time scales , we may ignore the dissipative terms and concentrate on the wave - like solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "note that when the dissipative components of the density wave equation can be neglected , eq .  ( [ eqs : ac - br - ph ] ) may be recast as a single wave equation . by applying the convective derivative @xmath82 to the continuity equation , eq .",

    "consider the first term , @xmath89 , which shows the minimal coupling between density gradients and spontaneous flow  @xcite .",
    "the penetration depth is a lengthscale that originates from density gradients and therefore scales as @xmath90 .",

    "in addition , @xmath93 is approximately the same from one unit cell to the next . combining these scaling relations , @xmath94 .",
    "the length @xmath33 diverges as the flow velocity goes to zero and , therefore , as the material loses its bulk bandgap .",

    "an exponential profile satisfies this approximate scaling form .",
    "such a profile is a consequence of the fact that @xmath93 does not vary over lengthscales larger than a unit cell , an argument that relies on the metamaterial structure of the topological state .",
    "by contrast , in the quantum hall fluid , the frequency scale depends on the field strength and @xmath93 varies over large distances , which leads to both a gaussian profile of states in a landau level as well as a different scaling for the penetration depth  @xcite .",
