    "2 , for the latter we present some plausible arguments concerning the size of these corrections .",
    "if not stated otherwise only a single parameter is varied at a time , while the other parameters are held fixed .",
    "for @xmath58 we substitute the corresponding two - point sum rule . the uncertainty in a given quantity is then expressed by plus / minus the interval of variation w.r.t .",
    "the result obtained for the nominal values of the input parameters .",
    "although in the parametrization ( [ paramb ] ) of @xmath21 the lcsr ( [ fplus ] ) is only used to determine the normalization at @xmath81 , we investigate the uncertainty of the lcsr prediction ( [ fplus ] ) in the whole range of validity , that is at @xmath113 .",

    "@xmath114 we rely on the parametrization ( 19 ) in a more substantial way .",

    "\\(c ) quark condensate density    the coefficient @xmath121 of the twist 3 pion distribution amplitude is related to the quark condensate density @xmath122 by pcac .",

    "the latter is even more so for the nonasymptotic coefficients of the twist 3 and 4 distribution amplitudes @xcite .",

    "a similar investigation of ( [ srcoupl ] ) shows that @xmath117 increases by about 8 % if all nonasymptotic effects are disregarded . since the lcsr ( [ fplus ] ) involves convolutions of relatively smooth coefficient functions with normalized distribution amplitudes , the moderate sensitivity to the precise shape of the latter is easy to understand .",

    "more conservatively , they may be of the same order as the twist 2 nlo corrections . since in lo the twist 3 terms contribute about @xmath139 to the lcsr , one may expect corrections to @xmath86 and @xmath117 as large as @xmath140 in total .",

    "this causes no problem for the light - cone expansion itself because even and odd twists are associated with different chiral structures of the underlying correlation function .",
    "the corresponding series are , therefore , independent from each other . more definitely , the expansion of the term in the heavy quark propagator proportional to the quark mass gives rise to a series in even twist , whereas the term proportional to the quark momentum is expanded in a series of terms carrying odd twist .",
    "important for the convergence of the expansion is the observation that the twist 4 contribution is heavily suppressed with respect to the twist 2 contribution as shown in fig .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known about the twist 5 term .",
    "if twist 5 is similarly suppressed with respect to twist 3 as twist 4 is suppressed with respect to twist 2 , the uncertainty due to the neglected higher - twist contributions is practically negligible .",
    "this assumption is made tacitly in all lcsr calculations .",
    "secondly , the uncertainties in the nonasymptotic coefficients of the pion distribution amplitudes induce an almost momentum - independent uncertainty in the form factor @xmath34 by about 5% in contrast to the shape - dependent uncertainty in @xmath86 .",
    "this can be clearly seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig8]b and fig .",
    "thirdly , for @xmath29 the nlo qcd corrections to the lcsr at twist 2 tend to be smaller than the corrections to the lcsr for @xmath51 , in contradiction to naive expectation .",
    "the reason is that the shrinkage of @xmath174 when going from charm to bottom is over - compensated by the growth of logarithms of the heavy quark mass appearing in the coefficient functions of the sum rules @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , the nlo effects on @xmath152 , @xmath34 and @xmath175 amount to about 10% , in contrast to @xmath176 corrections in the @xmath25-meson case .",
    "we also expect this tendency to persist for the missing nlo corrections at twist 3 .",
    "the maximal 15% estimated for @xmath51 would then correspond to about 6% for @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath3 transition form factor is calculated from the lcsr ( [ fplus ] ) and ( [ srcoupl ] ) using the same input parameters as for @xmath2 with the exception of the distribution amplitudes . for the kaon distribution amplitude of twist 2",
    "we take @xmath177 \\label{expansion1}\\ ] ] with @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "in addition to the features of the pion distribution amplitude @xmath182 given in ( [ expansion ] ) , the above amplitude incorporates effects from @xmath183-flavour violation .",
    "this is seen from the presence of the coefficients @xmath184 giving rise to asymmetric momentum distributions for the strange and nonstrange quark constituents inside the kaon .",
    "the distribution amplitude @xmath185 used in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the @xmath28 transition form factor differs from ( [ expansion1 ] ) in neglecting @xmath186 which , however , is quantitatively not important .",
    "other @xmath183-breaking effects in the distribution amplitudes are neglected .",
    "this is certainly justified for the nonasymptotic terms of twist 3 and 4 analyzed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite which have anyway only a minor influence on the lcsr as pointed out earlier . for a similar reason , the twist 3 and 4 quark - gluon distribution amplitudes",
    "are also taken in the @xmath183 limit .",
    "furthermore , in the coefficients of the twist 2 and 3 distribution amplitudes @xmath187 is replaced by @xmath188 mev , and @xmath189 by @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "the latter brings the mass of the strange quark into the game which is not very well known . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was advocated to rely on chiral perturbation theory in the @xmath183 limit and use _ k= _",
    "[ cpt ] with the quark condensate @xmath191 , this yields @xmath192 mev . in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath193 mev which covers the range of most estimates including the rather low mass suggested by some of the lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "the numerical predictions derived from the lcsr ( [ fplus ] ) and ( [ srcoupl ] ) with the above input are tabulated in tab . 1 for three different values of the strange quark mass .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the form factor @xmath194 at @xmath195 gev@xmath15 and the pole - contribution from the @xmath196 ground state as a function of the momentum transfer squared .",
    "the two - pole parametrization analogous to ( [ paramd ] ) , @xmath197 is also displayed in fig .",
    "for these plots we have chosen the nominal values of the input parameters . whereas the normalization of @xmath194 is rather sensitive to @xmath48 @xcite ,",
    "the shape parameter @xmath198 is more or less @xmath48-independent .",
    "moreover , similarly as in the case of @xmath34 , @xmath198 is consistent with zero implying a strong dominance of the @xmath196 pole .",
    ".@xmath3 transition parameters as a function of the @xmath50-quark mass [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    this is confirmed by measurements of @xmath199 in the cleo @xcite and e687 @xcite experiments .",
    "the data including those from earlier experiments are summarized in ref .",
    "for illustration , fitting the single - pole formula f^+_dk(p^2 ) = [ fdkpole ] to the world - average of the data one obtains f^+(0)= 0.76 0.03 ,  m=2.00 0.15  .",
    "[ fdkexp ] while for @xmath200 mev the expectation on @xmath201 and the experimental result perfectly match , the mass of the pole is measured to be slightly lighter than @xmath202 gev , but within error it is still consistent with expectation .",
    "there are also lattice determinations of the @xmath203 form factor which confirm the @xmath144-pole dominance .",
    "the world average of @xmath204 is given by @xcite f^+_dk(0)= 0.73 0.07  , [ fdklat ] while a more recent calculation by the ape - collaboration @xcite yields @xmath205 .",
    "comparison of these results with tab .",
    "1 implies a @xmath50-quark mass which is even somewhat heavier than 150 mev .",
    "while such a value is in accordance with the pcac expectation ( [ cpt ] ) , it remains to be seen if it can be reconciled with the smallest mass values resulting from lattice investigations @xcite .",
    "the parametrizations ( [ paramb ] ) , ( [ paramd ] ) and ( [ paramdk ] ) of the form factors @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath194 can be used to calculate the distributions of the momentum transfer squared @xmath43 in exclusive , semileptonic @xmath25 and @xmath8 decays , respectively . for @xmath4 with @xmath7",
    "one has = ( e_^2-m_^2)^3/2 ^ 2 [ dg ] with @xmath208 being the pion energy in the @xmath25 rest frame .",
    "the charged lepton is considered massless . substituting ( [ paramb ] ) for @xmath209",
    "one obtains the integrated width ( b|l _ l ) = _ 0^(m_b - m_)^2 dp^2 = ( 7.3 2.5 )  |v_ub|^2  ^-1  .",
    "[ elmu ] it is important to note that the theoretical uncertainty in the above mainly comes from the uncertainty in the normalization parameter @xmath112 .",
    "the uncertainty in the shape parameter @xmath100 has very little influence on the integrated width , so does the use of the two - pole parametrization ( [ paramb ] ) .",
    "this is anticipated from the normalized decay distribution plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "our result agrees with the integrated semileptonic width ( b|l _ l ) = 8.5 ^+3.4_-1.5  |v_ub|^2  ^-1 [ elmulatt ] derived in ref .",
    "@xcite from a lattice - constrained parametrization of @xmath108 .    experimentally , combining the branching ratio @xmath210 with the @xmath211 lifetime @xmath212 ps @xcite , one gets ( b^0 ^ - l^+ _ l ) = ( 1.17 0.39)10 ^ -4  ^-1  .",
    "[ cleopi7 ] from that and ( [ elmu ] ) one can then determine the quark mixing parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the result is |v_ub|=(4.0 0.7 0.7)10 ^ -3 [ result ] with the experimental error and theoretical uncertainty given in this order .",
    "this value lies within the range of @xmath19 quoted by the particle data group @xcite : |v_ub|=0.002 0.005  , [ resultpdg ] and also agrees @xcite with the determination from @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "conversely , turning to @xmath52 one can use the known value of @xmath46 and subject the lcsr method to an experimental test . from ( [ paramd ] ) one obtains = 0.13 0.05 ^-1  , [ dpilnu ] while the experimental width following from @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216  @xcite is given by = 0.177 0.038 ^ -1  .",
    "[ brd ] the agreement is satisfactory , although the theoretical and experimental uncertainties are still too big for a really decisive test .",
    "for this reason , it is particularly interesting to note the very small theoretical uncertainties in the normalized momentum distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "it would be very useful to have comparably precise data .        .",
    "[ dklnu ] which should be compared with the experimental width = 0.087 0.004 ^-1 [ brdk ] derived from @xmath218 together with the above @xmath219 lifetime , and @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "the latter interval for @xmath47 obtained from unitarity of the ckm matrix is very tight and has therefore a negligible influence on the experimental error in ( [ brdk ] ) . despite of the considerable uncertainty",
    "remaining even when @xmath48 is fixed , the comparison of lcsr and data clearly favours a relatively heavy strange quark mass of about 150 mev or slightly more .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by considering the ratio of partial widths r== \\ {      .",
    "[ ratio ] in which the uncertainties not related to the strange quark mass drop out to a large extent .",
    "the experimental world average quoted in @xcite , r = 0.10 0.02 , [ rexp ] again supports a strange quark mass between 150 mev and 200 mev .",
    "contrary to the integrated width , the distribution in momentum transfer is insensitive to @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , since the shape parameter @xmath198 is very small or vanishing , the normalized decay distribution in @xmath217 is predicted very reliably as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "it can therefore serve as a stringent test similarly as the corresponding distribution in @xmath221 .",
    "we conclude with a final remark on the uncertainties in the lcsr results .",
    "unlike phenomenological quark models , the lcsr approach allows to estimate the uncertainty in a given result within the same framework .",
    "this is one of the main virtues of qcd sum rules .",
    "the model - dependence due to the use of a particular two - pole parametrization of the form factors is negligible or unimportant in the present applications . in @xmath222",
    "it only concerns the region of large momentum transfer , and is therefore negligible in the integrated semileptonic width and the value of @xmath19 extracted from it .",
    "the @xmath8 meson form factors , on the other hand , are completely dominated by the pole of the respective ground - state vector meson , and therefore insensitive to the effective second pole modelling effects from excited states . in total , the present theoretical uncertainty in the integrated widths of the semileptonic @xmath25 and @xmath8 decays considered in this paper is estimated to be about 30 to 40 % .",
    "thus , in order to match the accuracy of the data on @xmath221 and the precision of @xmath223 measurements expected at the new @xmath25 factories , the theoretical uncertainties have to be reduced by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "this is not impossible , but will require considerable efforts . among the most important tasks are the nlo calculation of the twist 3 contributions , a reanalysis of the non - asymptotic corrections to the light - cone distribution amplitudes including mass effects , and an at least rough estimate of the size of the twist 5 terms .      for completeness",
    ", we also present an update of the lcsr prediction on the @xmath28 transition form factor @xmath224 .",
    "this form factor plays an important role in the theoretical analysis of the rare decays @xmath225 , @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "the previous lcsr estimates of @xmath224 @xcite are restricted to the region of small and intermediate momentum transfer and not applicable to large momentum transfer where the @xmath227 pole contribution with the residue given by the @xmath228 coupling becomes dominant . here",
    ", we have performed an analysis in analogy to the calculation of the @xmath1 form factor described in this paper with the pion distribution amplitudes replaced by the corresponding kaon distribution amplitudes given in section 4 .",
    "calculating @xmath229 from the lcsr ( [ fplus ] ) and @xmath230 from the lcsr ( [ srcoupl ] ) , and deriving , from that , the remaining parameter @xmath231 of the two - pole parametrization [ parambk ] f_bk^+(p^2)=  , we find @xmath232 for @xmath233 mev and @xmath234 .",
