    "this is due to the fact that any reaction which depends on the available volume and the diffusivity of reactants is affected by macromolecular crowding  @xcite .",
    "it is known that macromolecular crowding influences the conformation , stability , and the function of nucleic acids  @xcite and proteins  @xcite .",

    "giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) , which are cell - sized spherical shells consisting of a lipid bilayer , are commonly used as containers for artificial cells in which many synthetic chemical reactions take place . in a recent paper by fujiwara and yanagisawa  @xcite , they used guvs filled with macromolecules in order to investigate the effect of higher viscosity inside the vesicles .",
    "when these guvs were subjected to osmotic pressure , they exhibited different shape deformations depending on the inside viscosity .",

    "seki and komura explicitly took into account the viscosity difference , and obtained an expression for the bending relaxation mode of quasi - spherical vesicles  @xcite .",
