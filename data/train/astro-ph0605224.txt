    "there has been some renewed interest in the study of several different black hole solutions such as the gibbons - maeda - garfinkle - horowitz - strominger ( gmghs ) dilaton black hole of string theory@xcite , the brane world black hole with tidal charge@xcite , the myers - perry black hole in the braneworld context@xcite , and the einstein - born - infeld black hole@xcite , in recent times .",
    "such studies are expected to shed light on the character of the strong gravitational field and the role of postulated extra dimensions in string and brane theories .",
    "comparison with the standard black hole solutions in four dimensions is important .",
    "for example , the braneworld black hole with tidal charge@xcite bears formal resemblance to the reissner - nordstrom black hole .",
    "the question of existence of closed orbits is also interesting , and has been recently investigated@xcite in the context of braneworld geometry .",
    "in addition , cosmological implications may be significant , as in the case of the myers - perry black hole in braneworld cosmology due to its modified evaporation and accretion properties@xcite .",
    "the study of black holes in the background of a cosmological constant , i.e. in the de sitter space time , have also attracted some interest for their conjectured relevance in ads / cft correspondence@xcite , and due to the phenomenon of black - hole anti - evaporation @xcite . the dilaton black hole solution in a de sitter universe",
    "has been recently derived@xcite .",
    "the dilaton of the gmghs black hole is a scalar field occuring in the low energy limit of the string theory .",
    "it has an important role on the causal structure and the thermodynamic properties of the black hole .",
    "though it was shown earlier that a dilaton black hole solution in the de sitter background is not possible with a simple dilaton potential@xcite , gao and zhang@xcite circumvented this problem with a dilaton potential being a combination of liouville type terms .",
    "such a black hole solution is interesting since it combines stringy features with the backdrop of the present accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the motivation for the present work is to explore avenues for possible signatures of cosmological expansion on the orbits of massive bodies and light around dilaton - de sitter black holes .",
    "gravitational lensing is a widely used tool in modern cosmology .",
    "historically , the theory of gravitational lensing was primarily developed in the weak field thin - lens approximation @xcite , and some recent studies of weak field lensing in braneworld geometries have also been performed@xcite .",
    "although these approximations are sufficiently accurate to discuss any present physical observations , the realization that many galaxies host supermassive central black holes@xcite has spurred the development of lensing phenomenology in the strong - field regime@xcite .",
    "bozza et al@xcite developed an analytical technique for obtaining the deflection angle for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "strong field lensing in the reisser - nordstrom space - time was then investigated@xcite .",
    "bozza@xcite extended the analytical theory of strong lensing for a general class of static , spherically symmetric , and asymptotically flat metrics and showed that the logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle at the photon sphere is a common feature of such spacetimes .    from the viewpoint of future observations , these are exciting times in the development of gravitational lensing of compact objects .",
    "newer black hole solutions corresponding to different theoretical models have appeared in the literature@xcite , and lensing due to several black hole metrics have been analysed recently@xcite with the goal of possible observational discrimination in future .",
    "gravitational lensing by the gmghs black hole has been studied by bhadra@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the strong field phenomenon of retrolensing has been discussed@xcite , and the position and magnifications of relativistic images due to strong lensing by several braneworld geometries representing the black hole at the centre of our galaxy have been computed@xcite .",
    "several interesting features of lensing by rotating black holes have also been identified@xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework of strong field gravitational lensing is being developed further with more suggested applications@xcite . in order to detect the existence of relativistic images a high order sensitive instrument with very long baseline interferometry",
    "is required .",
    "planned facilities such as maxim can achieve up to @xmath0 resolution in the x - ray band@xcite .",
    "but if future experiments can attain @xmath1 resolution , and if such relativistic images are detected , then lensing observations will be able to distinguish between the predictions of different black hole models and probe deeply the character of gravity in the strong field regime .",
    "in this paper we present properties of the motion of particles and light in the spacetime of a dilaton - de sitter black hole .",
    "we derive equations of motion and different conserved quantities for particle motion .",
    "we also derive the expression for the effective potential which can be used to obtain bound orbits in this geometry .",
    "analysis of the effective potential for the dilaton de - sitter black hole shows that the hubble expansion of the universe may significantly contribute to the effective potential only at large distances . in presence of the hubble term",
    ", we derive an upper bound on the value of the angular momentum per mass of the orbiting particle that can be in a bound orbit around the black hole .",
    "we then study strong gravitational lensing in this spacetime applying the method of bozza@xcite for the case of a non - asymptotically flat metric for the first time .",
    "we obtain the expressions for the lensing observables in terms of the metric coefficients for this geometry .",

    "the aim of strong field gravitational lensing is to detect the relativistic images corresponding to specific lensing candidates and measure their separations and flux ratios .",
    "once this is accomplished , the observed data could be compared with the theoretical coefficients obtained using various metrics . a precise set of observational data for strong gravitational lensing , if obtained , could therefore be able discriminate between different models of gravity .    lensing observables such as the angular position of the relativistic images ( @xmath162 , the angular separation of the outermost relativistic image with the remaining bunch of relativistic images ( @xmath160 ) , and the relativistic magnification of the outermost relativistic image with respect to the other relativistic images ( @xmath163 )",

    "the schwarzschild black hole@xcite , the braneworld black hole with negative tidal charge@xcite , and the reissner - nordstrom black hole ( which can also be considered as a gmghs black hole@xcite with dilaton potential minimum @xmath164 ) .",
    "all these metrics have aroused interest recently as black hole candidates representing gravity modified in separate contexts .",
    "it should be mentioned here that according to recent observational results@xcite , supermassive black holes including the one in our galactic centre seem to be spinning at considerable rates as described by the kerr solution , but there is lack of evidence regarding any charged astrophysical black holes . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "no black hole solution has yet been found which incorporates both the dilaton and de sitter expansion for the kerr black hole , though there exit some interesting applications of particle motion in the kerr - de sitter metric@xcite .",
    "further , strong gravitational lensing by the kerr metric itself is endowed with additional features , and the full phenomenological implications are in the process of being worked out@xcite .",
    "considering the supermassive black hole in the galactic center ( with its mass @xmath165 and its distance from us @xmath166@xcite ) as a charged dilaton black hole in a cosmological background , one can estimate the observables of strong lensing .",

    "hence one sees that the hubble expansion makes a rather tiny modification ( @xmath170 ) to the observable values , that are too insignificant to enable , for example , the dilaton - de sitter metric to be distinguished from the gmghs metric .",
    "in this paper we have discussed several features of the motion of particles and light in the spacetime of a charged dilaton black hole in a cosmological background .",
    "the black hole solution recently obtained@xcite corresponding to the dilaton - de sitter metric could be relevant for the study of string theoretic implications in the context of the presently accelerating universe .",
    "the conserved quantities in the dilaton - de sitter metric have been identified and the hamilton - jacobi method employed for the equations of motion .",
    "we have also obtained the effective potential for this metric in order to analyse the existence of bound orbits in this metric in an expanding universe .",
    "close to the black hole the dilatonic contribution in the effective potential dominates over that of the hubble term which is rather negligible .",
    "however , we find that at large distances from the black hole the effective potential could be significantly affected by the hubble expansion . we have derived an expression for the upper value of the angular momentum per mass of the orbiting particle up to which bound orbits could exist in this metric .",
    "we have further investigated strong field gravitational lensing in the dilaton - de sitter metric .",
    "gravitational lensing promises to be a powerfull tool in future observations for probing the strong field character of gravity that may be able to incorporate signatures of extra dimensions as in string or brane models . here",
    "we have extended the application of the standard strong lensing framework@xcite used previously for only asymptotically flat spacetimes , for obtaining the expressions for the different lensing variables as functions of the metric parameters of the non - asymptotically flat dilaton - de sitter metric .",
    "we note however , that the value of the hubble parameter is too small to impact the position of relativistic images and other strong lensing quantities in any observationally significant way .",
    "we conclude with the rider that though our present analysis may not provide accurate estimates of the actual position of stable orbits or of lensing observables for any astrophysical black hole in the expanding universe , these calculations may serve to motivate future analysis using more advanced theoretical techniques suitable to handle the realistic situations including effects such as black hole rotation .",
