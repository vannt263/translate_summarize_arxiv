    "the eclipsing hyades binary v471  tauri lies at a distance of @xmath7  pc ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) and comprises a cool main - sequence ( ms ) star ( dk2 ) and a hot degenerate white dwarf ( da1.5 ) in an orbit with a period of 0.52 days .",
    "it is a detached binary in which neither star fills its roche lobe , and has a separation of @xmath8 ( young & nelson 1972 ) .",
    "the system is evolving toward a cataclysmic variable phase in which the k dwarf will overfill its roche lobe and transfer mass through accretion onto the white dwarf .",
    "as such , v471  tau is a rare example of a nearby pre - cataclysmic system and presents a valuable opportunity to study the origin and evolution of this type of close binary .    based on evolutionary time ",
    "scales , vauclair ( 1972 ) argued that the current mass of the v471  tau system is much lower than that expected from a progenitor system in which one component has reached the white dwarf phase .",
    "moreover , the orbital separation is much smaller than the radius of the primary star during its red giant phase .",
    "it was therefore proposed that the system had gone through a common envelope ( ce ) phase , during which the initial orbital separation was sufficiently large that the secondary was only engulfed after the primary had attained red giant dimensions ( paczyski 1976 ) . during a ce phase",
    ", friction leads to a rapid spiraling down of the orbit .",
    "if the ce is spun up sufficiently during this time , a substantial fraction can be ejected from the system thereby avoiding coalescence of the companion with the red giant core ( iben & livio 1993 ) .    despite strong theoretical arguments in favour of this evolutionary scenario for v471  tau and other systems in similar evolutionary stages , unequivocal observational evidence supporting the ce phase",
    "has so far been lacking . during a ce phase",
    ", some fraction of the red giant envelope should have been accreted by the k dwarf .",
    "this phase would therefore be betrayed by the presence of the products of interior nuclear burning dredged - up into the envelope of the red giant during the ascent of the giant branch .    during the ms evolution of a solar - type star ,",
    "the central abundance of c decreases to about 5%  of its initial value while the n abundance increases such that the total number of c and n nuclei remains approximately constant .",
    "the isotopic ratios @xmath9c/@xmath6c and @xmath10o/@xmath11o also decrease by about an order of magnitude . determining the c and n abundances in the red dwarf from atomic lines in photospheric spectra",
    "is complicated by rotational smearing and the weakness of available lines of n  i , and , to our knowledge , no such measurements yet exist for the dwarfs in pre - cataclysmic systems .",
    "sarna et al .  (",
    "1995 ) proposed using the co bands near 1.59 , 2.3 and 4.6  @xmath12 m for determining the @xmath9c/@xmath6c and @xmath10o/@xmath11o abundance ratios .",
    "dhillon et al .",
    "( 2002 ; see also cataln et al .",
    "2001 ) analysed co band spectra of v471  tau and the cataclysmic variable ss  cyg and found some evidence for the @xmath6c expected from the cn - cycle , though the results were inconclusive because of possible blending with neutral species .    in this paper , using",
    "chandra _ low energy transmission grating spectrograph ( letgs ) x - ray spectra of ly@xmath13 resonance transitions in c and n",
    "h - like ions , we determine for the first time the c / n abundance ratio in the k dwarf secondary of v471  tau . we show that the secondary star has half the c / n ratio expected for the surface of an unevolved star , presenting the first definitive evidence of the ce phase in which substantial surface contamination by the red giant envelope of its companion occurred .",
    "v471  tau was observed for approximately one day by _ chandra _ using the low energy transmission grating and high resolution camera ( letgs ) in standard instrument configurations , between 2002 january  24 ut  22:31 and january  25 ut  23:38 .",
    "observational data were obtained from the public chandra data archive , and pipeline - processed ( cxc software version 6.3.1 ) photon event lists were reduced using the ciao software package version 2.2 .",
    "this latter processing included filtering of events based on observed signal pulse - heights to reduce background ( wargelin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the resulting spectra had an effective exposure time of 87494s .",
    "spectra were analysed using the pintofale idl software suite ( kashyap & drake 2000 ) .",
    "the line strengths analysed here were measured by fitting `` modified lorentzian '' functions of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the amplitude and @xmath16 a characteristic line width . for a value of @xmath17 , it has been found that this function represents the line response function of the letg+hrc - s instrument to the photometric accuracy of lines with of order a few thousand counts or less ( drake et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the letgs spectrum of v471  tau is characterized at long wavelengths ( @xmath18   ) by the strong thermal continuum from the white dwarf photosphere that is expected on the basis of earlier euv and x - ray observations ( e.g.  barstow et al .",
    "however , this continuum contributes no flux shortward of 50   , and at shorter wavelengths the spectrum is dominated by easily discernible emission lines that we interpret as coronal emission from the k dwarf .",
    "no modulation of the coronal emission with orbital phase was seen , such as might be expected if the uv radiation field of the white dwarf were influencing the corona facing it through modification of its underlying chromospheric structure ( d.  garcia et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the spectrum in the region between 23 - 36    that contains the ly@xmath13 resonance lines of h - like n and c is illustrated in figure  [ f : spectra ] .",
    "we show in the same figure the _ chandra _ letgs spectra of the k2 dwarf @xmath19  eri and the k0iii giant @xmath20  ceti obtained from the public archive and processed in the same way as the v471  tau observation .",
    "we draw particular attention to the different relative strengths of the c and n lines in these stars .",
    "it has recently been shown that the ratio of the strengths of these lines is essentially independent of temperature over the range @xmath21 ( schmitt & ness 2002 , drake 2003a , drake et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the ratio of their measured fluxes for active stars with dominant coronal temperatures @xmath22  k , such as the stars in figure  [ f : spectra ] , therefore yields directly the c / n abundance ratio . that all three stars are indeed dominated by temperatures above @xmath23  k is underscored by the relative strengths of the h - like and he - like resonance lines of n at 24.78    and 28.79   , the latter of which is almost absent . since all three spectra in figure  [ f : spectra ] were obtained with the same instrument , the variation in the relative c and n line strengths , @xmath24 , can be interpreted directly in terms of the ratio of the c and n number densities , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the photon emissivity of element x under coronal equilibrium conditions . in photon units , the pintofale emissivity ratio in equation  [ e : abunrat ] , computed using the chianti  v3 ( dere et al .",
    "2001 ) implementation of the collision strengths of aggarwal & kingston ( 1991 ) , together with the ionization balance of mazzotta et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , is @xmath27 ( see also drake 2003a ) .",
    "the c and n lines of the unevolved dwarf @xmath19  eri and the giant @xmath20  ceti were analysed recently by schmitt & ness ( 2002 ) .",
    "these authors concluded that the c / n line strength ratio for @xmath19  eri was consistent with a solar , or `` unevolved '' , c / n abundance ratio .",
    "for the solar photospheric c abundance c / h=8.39 ( allende  prieto et al .  2002 ) and n abundance",
    "n / h=7.92 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) , the line intensity ratio is @xmath28 .",
    "schmitt & ness ( 2002 ) measured a value for @xmath19  eri of @xmath29 .",
    "there appear to be no recent determinations of the photospheric n abundance in @xmath19  eri , though the c abundance is within 0.1  dex or so of the solar value ( takeda et al .",
    "2001 ; zhao et al .",
    "2002 ) . allowing for an uncertainty of 0.1  dex in the photospheric ratio ,",
    "this is then consistent with the coronal c / n line ratio .",
    "in contrast , the schmitt & ness ( 2002 ) ratio for @xmath20  ceti , whose surface composition has been modified by the dredged - up products of cn - cycling , is @xmath30an order of magnitude smaller . based on the drake ( 2003a ) theoretical c / n line strength ratio for a solar c / n abundance ratio , the measured ratio for @xmath20  ceti corresponds to an abundance ratio of [ c / n]@xmath31 relative to the sun.$]+12 , where @xmath32 is the number density of element x , and [ x / y ] represents the logarithic x / y abundance ratio relative to the solar value .",
    "] we note that this is in good agreement with the photospheric measurement of lambert & ries ( 1981 ) .",
    "the v471  tau c and n lines in figure  [ f : spectra ] are in a proportion intermediate between that of an unevolved composition exemplified by @xmath19  eri and the post - dredge - up surface composition of @xmath20  ceti . a formal value for the c / n abundance ratio of v471  tau is given by the observed spectral line flux ratio .",
    "measured line strengths are listed in table  [ t : fluxes ] . the intensity ratio to abundance ratio conversion factor from equation  [ e : abunrat ] , @xmath33 , leads directly to the result c / n@xmath34 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) , or [ c / n]@xmath4 .",
    "does this coronal value represent the composition of underlying atmospheric layers ?",
    "a large body of observational evidence now exists demonstrating that the abundances of elements in the coronae of stars can differ substantially from their photospheric values ( e.g.  drake 2003b ) .",
    "the differences appear to be driven predominantly by the element first ionization potential ( fip ) . in active stars , coronal abundances of very high fip elements such as",
    "ne and ar appear enhanced relative to abundances of low fip elements such as fe , mg and si . elements such as c , n and o appear to remain close to photosheric values .",
    "drake ( 2003a ) concluded that c and n are not fractionated to any significant extent in the corona of the active binary v711  tau , as expected based on their very similar fips .",
    "while we can not rule out relative fraction among c and n with certainty , this does not appear likely .",
    "we therefore consider our derived c / n abundance ratio to be directly applicable to the deeper regions of the v471  tau k dwarf .",
    "the duration of a ce phase is thought to range typically from @xmath36 to @xmath37yr , with a maximum of about @xmath38yr ( taam 1989 ; iben & livio 1993 ) .",
    "calculations by hjellming & taam ( 1991 ) indicate that the red dwarf can accrete some of the red giant envelope ( 0.01 - 0.2@xmath39 ) during this time .",
    "our c / n abundance ratio enables us to estimate this amount of accreted mass .    for the case of a typical intermediate mass star ( 2.5@xmath39 , @xmath40 ) ,",
    "stellar evolutionary calculations predict a decrease in the surface c / n abundance ratio between the zero age main - sequence ( zams ) and immediately prior to the first thermal pulse by a factor of 3.75 ( e.g.  el eid 1994 , girardi et al . 1996 ) . from grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) and allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) , the c / n ratio for the sun expressed in terms of mass fraction is 2.54 and the mass fractions of c and n are @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . assuming both progenitors of the v471  tau system had an initial c / n ratio similar to that of the sun , our abundance ratio derived from the _ chandra _ letgs spectrum implies a reduction in the red dwarf c / n ratio by a factor of 2.4    during the ce phase , the red dwarf secondary effectively exists within the envelope of the red giant primary .",
    "the accreted material therefore has the chemical composition of a giant star .",
    "the material accreted during the ce phase will be mixed on a convective - mixing ( dynamical ) time - scale .",
    "the mass of the region that is mixed , @xmath43 , consists of the sum of the masses of the convective region of the original star , @xmath44 , and the accreted matter @xmath45 .",
    "the c / n abundance by mass fraction at the surface of the red dwarf in the post - ce phase , @xmath46 , is then given by @xmath47 the accreted mass can then be written @xmath48 here , the c and n mass fractions for the giant phase are assumed to be the solar values modified such that @xmath49 is reduced by the factor of 3.75 predicted by evolutionary calculations , as noted above : @xmath50=0.00197 , @xmath51=0.0029 . the quantity @xmath45",
    "is illustrated as a function of the red dwarf initial mass in figure  [ f : macc ] .",
    "the convection zone mass , @xmath44 , has been taken from models computed using a standard stellar evolutionary code based on the henyey - type method of paczyski ( 1970 ) , which has beeen adopted to low - mass stars ( see marks & sarna 1998 ) .",
    "the recent mass determination of obrien , sion & bond ( 2001 ) , @xmath52 , leads to an accreted mass in the range 0.015 - 0.04@xmath53 , and a similar initial convection zone mass .",
    "sarna et al . ( 1995 ) described how accretion during the ce phase changes the @xmath9c/@xmath6c ratio on the surface of the red dwarf .",
    "analogous to equation  [ e : macc ] , the accretion - modified @xmath9c/@xmath6c ratio is given by @xmath54 using the values of @xmath45 and @xmath44 from ",
    "[ s : accrete ] , we obtain a mass fraction ratio @xmath55 . this value is slightly larger than the tentative estimate of @xmath56 based on co bands near @xmath57 m by dhillon et al .",

    "the li in a late g or early k dwarf is expected to be highly depleted by hyades age , with a value li / h@xmath58 ( e.g.  barrado  y  navascus & stauffer 1996 ; zboril et al .",
    "however , for hyades dwarfs in binaries , li abundances are higher by up to 3 orders of magnitude ; the largest abundances found are in dwarf members of short period binaries ( barrado  y  navascus & stauffer 1996 ) .",
    "these high li abundances have been interpreted in terms of inhibited mixing in these rapidly - rotating stars , both during the pre - ms and ms phases ( e.g.zahn 1994 ) .",
    "v471  tau has an abundance li / h@xmath59 ( martin , pavlenko & rebolo 1997 ; barrado  y  navascus & stauffer 1996 ) , which is not in itself conspicuously different to that of similar short period binaries .",
    "however , the ce scenario and white dwarf age imply that the close - binary nature of v471  tau is only very recent . prior to this current evolutionary phase",
    "it should have already lost its li .",
    "martin et al .  (",
    "1997 ) suggested that the k dwarf regained li from a li - rich red giant envelope during the ce phase and suggested that the rare li - rich giants might be associated with a ce evolutionary phase .",

    "the expression for the present day li mass fraction in a dwarf accreting from such a li - rich giant is @xmath61 based on the observed present day li abundance and our values of @xmath45 and @xmath44 , we can estimate the required li abundance of the red giant envelope to be in the range li / h@xmath59 - 2.8 immediately prior to the ce phase .",
    "this result is in good agreement with typical values for li - rich giants ( de mederios et al .",

    "charbonnel & balachandran ( 2000 ) identify two distinct episodes of li production which occur during rgb and early agb phases , depending upon the mass of the star . in the case of v471  tau , the progenitor of the white dwarf must have been more massive than the red giants now in the hyades and presents an evolutionary problem ( e.g.  obrien et al.2001 and references therein ) .",
