    "we consider trapped atomic ensembles and investigate the possibility to prepare superposition states by means of optical quantum non - demolition measurements .",
    "the idea to probe the state of an atomic system by allowing the system to interact with a light field and then subject the light field to measurements is very useful .",

    "several recent experiments @xcite have focused on the possibility to trap cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates inside high - finesse optical cavities , because the cavity enhances the light - atom interaction strength , and the strong - coupling regime , where the coherent dynamics takes place on a faster time scale than the dissipative dynamics , has been reached . in addition , optical measurements can be used to investigate the atom statistics of atom laser beams @xcite and the atomic population statistics of optical lattices @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate that for the strong - coupling parameters obtained in @xcite , a measurement procedure similar to the quantum non - demolition measurement used to generate spin squeezed states can be used to generate quantum superposition states , as outlined in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a related proposal ) . in sec .",

    "choosing @xmath19 to be real , it follows from that @xmath22 , and a measurement of the @xmath23-quadrature of the cavity field is thus unable to distinguish between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "extreme @xmath24 values , @xmath211 , leads to cavity 1 being almost in the vacuum state because the effective resonance frequency of the cavity is shifted by the atoms and the probe beam is hardly coupled into the cavity at all .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the squeezing is very weak for these extreme @xmath24-values , as observed in the figure .     for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath27  mhz , @xmath28  ghz , @xmath204 , @xmath212 , @xmath213  mhz , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .",
    "the blue ( dark ) lines are for @xmath216 and it is apparent that the state corresponding to @xmath100 is squeezed in the @xmath176-quadrature and anti - squeezed in the @xmath217-quadrature . as @xmath26 increases , the squeezing is rapidly reduced and the uncertainty ellipse turns so that the minimal ( maximal ) uncertainty is no longer along @xmath176 ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "the quadratures thus become correlated and back - action due to an @xmath176 measurement also affects the @xmath217 mean value .",
    "the red ( bright ) lines are for @xmath218 and in that case , the @xmath100 state is anti - squeezed in the @xmath219-quadrature and squeezed in the @xmath217-quadrature .",

    ", where @xmath221 are the positions of the peaks of the @xmath24-distribution of the atoms .",
    "the larger @xmath222 , the more separated are the two components of the macroscopic superposition , cf .",
    "[ state](b ) .",
    "the results are for @xmath120 and coupling and loss parameters like in fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] .",
    "the input light and squeezing is on for @xmath117  s , but we continue observations for an additional time of @xmath223  s in order for the cavity light field to decay to vacuum .",

    "the blue ( dark ) @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 symbols indicate results for @xmath153 and @xmath229 , respectively .",

    "as can be seen , probing with weakly squeezed vacuum can lead to higher purity than probing with unsqueezed coherent light . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pur_vs_m ] we plot numerical results for @xmath153 and various values of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath158 , and , for reference , we also plot results of probing with a coherent state field with @xmath234 . for nonzero @xmath158 ,",
    "the obtained state depends on the whole detection record and every realization of the noise @xmath166 leads to a unique state .",
    "it is thus more difficult to summarize the results .",
    "we have chosen to present a scatter plot of purity versus @xmath222 , where @xmath221 are the positions in the peaks in the @xmath24 distribution of the atoms , cf .",
    "[ state](b ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath222 thus correspond to a more `` macroscopic '' superposition state .    for the strongest",
    "squeezing considered , @xmath235 , we see that for all but the highest values of @xmath222 , the purity is lower than what is obtained with coherent state probing like in sec .",
    "we attribute this to the correlations between the field leaking out of the cavities and the field inside the cavities : in contrast to a coherent state , the purity of a squeezed state decreases if it is subjected to loss , and the stochastic movement of the mean values of the cavity field for different values of @xmath24 may increase the distance in phase space between the cavity fields corresponding to the same value of @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , it is not quite fair to compare the @xmath236 results to the coherent state results as for the chosen observation time , @xmath117  s , the former has more peaked @xmath24 distributions than the latter .",
    "this means that one could have reduced @xmath15 in the squeezed case .",
    "instead we keep @xmath15 fixed and look at results for @xmath237 , which for @xmath117  s leads to @xmath24-distributions very similar to the coherent state results . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pur_vs_m ] , we can then preserve a high purity while still being sensitive enough to make the @xmath24 distribution double - peaked .",
    "the highest purity is found for the phase of @xmath158 where the @xmath100 light - state is squeezed in the @xmath217 quadrature .",
    "a closer analysis reveals that for higher @xmath26 the measurement back - action is then less likely to drive the light field amplitudes for @xmath238 apart and thus the field leaking to the environment carries less information on the atomic state .    finally , we can also consider very weak squeezing , @xmath239 .",
    "the purity is then above 95% for all @xmath222 for all simulations .",
    "for such weak squeezing , however , the peaks in the @xmath24-distribution are considerably wider than for the coherent state scheme .",
    "it may be noted that for the very weak squeezing , the phase of @xmath158 apparently has a pronounced effect on the purity even for the highest values of @xmath222 , while for stronger squeezing , the difference disappears as @xmath222 is increased .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed a protocol , which uses optical measurements to conditionally prepare an ensemble of spin-@xmath240 atoms in a superposition of a state with most of the atoms in the spin up state and a state with most of the atoms in the spin down state .",
    "the physics of the protocol may be understood by referring to the plot of the cavity field in fig .",
    "[ alphaplot ] .",
    "a large horizontal distance between two states means that the states are easy to distinguish in an @xmath23-quadrature measurement , and the vertical distance between the states @xmath24 and @xmath25 determines the rate of decrease of purity due to light field losses .",
    "increasing @xmath241 moves the coherent states around the edge of a circle towards the origin , and for an initially coherent spin state , this increases the purity obtained after a given probing time and a favorable measurement outcome , but it also decreases the distance @xmath137 between the two peaks obtained in the distribution over the different @xmath8 eigenstates , because for large @xmath241 only states with @xmath24 very close to zero are easily distinguished from states with @xmath24 close to @xmath242 .",
    "this is , however , of no concern for @xmath243 , and in this case perfect pure quantum superposition states are obtained in the limit @xmath244 .",
    "an increased number of atoms increases @xmath137 and the purity of the final states , because more states are added to the left in fig .",
    "[ alphaplot ] , but the increase in @xmath137 is small , and @xmath147 decreases with @xmath60 . both the rate of gain of information , the rate of loss of photons , and the rate of spontaneous emission scale linearly with the probe beam intensity .    we have also investigated probing with a continuous beam of squeezed vacuum .",
    "this system is significantly harder to analyze because the back - action effect of the measurements is more complicated , but we have found numerically that it is possible to achieve a higher purity of the generated states if the probe beam is slightly squeezed .",
    "the stochastic master equation is quite general and may be used to analyze probing with squeezed light in other settings as well .",
    "the phase shift of the light field per round trip in the cavity has been assumed to be infinitesimally small , but we note that additional possibilities arise if the phase shift per round trip is comparable to @xmath245 . a pure superposition of @xmath246 and @xmath247 can , for instance , be obtained if the phase shift per round trip is @xmath248 for @xmath249 and light field losses within the atomic ensemble are negligible , since , in that case , there is no difference between the cavity field strength for the @xmath101 atomic states , but only a difference between the local phase variation of the fields inside the atomic medium . similarly , if the phase shift is @xmath177 per round trip per atom and @xmath60 is even , it is possible to generate pure superpositions of states with even values of @xmath24 and pure superpositions of states with odd values of @xmath24 .",
    "a coherent spin state is a convenient starting point , because it has the desired initial symmetry and is relatively easy to prepare experimentally , but it could also be interesting to consider other initial states . in @xcite , it has , for instance , been suggested to spin squeeze the coherent spin state in order to increase the weight of the larger @xmath26 components .",
    "another interesting possibility is to start from a time - reversal eigenstate .",
    "for such a state the additional spin symmetries in @xmath157 are not required , cf .",
    "[ sec : time - reversal ] , and it is possible to perform arbitrary spin rotations during the probing without breaking the @xmath238 symmetry .",
    "this opens the way to use a feedback scheme similar to the scheme analyzed in @xcite to force the atoms into an equal superposition of @xmath130 and @xmath250 ( for the case where the initial state is an eigenstate of @xmath61 with eigenvalue @xmath251 ) .",
    "note that @xmath252 ( and any rotated version of this state ) fulfills these requirements .",
