    "supernova ( sn ) 1987a in the large magellanic cloud was the closest supernova explosion to earth ( 50kpc ) observed since kepler s sn1604ad , making it a unique target to study supernova and supernova remnant physics .",
    "supernovae are thought to be one of the most important sources of dust in the universe .",
    "stars synthesize heavy elements , and after they explode , rapid expansion and radiation cause the ejected gas to cool rapidly , allowing refractory elements to condense into dust grains .",
    "dust masses have been measured in over twenty supernovae and supernova remnants @xcite ; most contain 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5m@xmath3 of warm dust , far below predictions of 0.1 - 1.0@xmath0m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one of the few exceptions is sn 1987a  far infrared photometry ( 100 - 350@xmath1 m ) with the herschel space observatory in 2011 implied 0.4 - 0.7@xmath0m@xmath3 of dust at 20 - 26@xmath0k @xcite .",
    "measured 24 years after the explosion , that dust mass is significantly higher than the 10@xmath6m@xmath3 reported from infrared measurements 1 - 2 years after the explosion @xcite .",
    "while the herschel result supports theoretical models of significant dust production , the discrepancy with prior results caused many to question whether all of the dust detected in 2011 was in fact produced in the supernova .",
    "sn@xmath01987a s progenitor star could have created a massive dust shell during its red supergiant phase .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) photometry of sn@xmath71987a in 2003 @xcite and spectroscopy in 2005 @xcite only found 10@xmath8m@xmath3 of warm progenitor dust .",
    "however , observations of galactic evolved stars with masses bracketing that of sn@xmath01987a s progenitor reveal between 0.01 and 0.4@xmath0m@xmath3 of dust ( the egg nebula , @xcite and eta carina , @xcite ) , so if only a minor warm component of the progenitor dust was detected in the mir , a large cold progenitor dust mass detected for the first time by herschel is plausible .",
    "herschel had insufficient spatial resolution to distinguish between the ejecta , shocked progenitor wind , and nearby interstellar material .",
    "resolved observations of sn@xmath01987a in the submillimeter regime are required to establish the location of the emission measured by herschel .",
    "multi - wavelength resolved images are required to determine its physical origin , and such images can be used to simultaneously study shock particle acceleration .",
    "twenty - five years after the explosion , sn@xmath01987a s blast wave had propagated to a radius of 7@xmath910@xmath10 cm ( 0.9on the sky ) , shocking material lost from the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "electrons accelerated by the shocks produce a bright shell or torus of synchrotron radiation at centimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the shocks are interacting with a dense equatorial ring tilted 43 degrees from the line - of - sight @xcite , dominating the emission at xray , optical to thermal infrared ( @xmath1130@xmath0@xmath1 m ) wavelengths @xcite .",
    "interior to the shock and ring are the remnants of the star s metal - rich core , referred to hereafter as the inner ejecta .",
    "a supernova explosion can also leave behind a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "the observed neutrino burst implies that a neutron star must have at least temporarily formed in sn@xmath01987a @xcite , but it has yet to be detected .",
    "if the neutron star energizes a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , its emission would most likely have a spectrum with power - law spectral index of -0.3 to 0 @xcite , flatter than synchrotron emission from the shock , perhaps detectable at millimeter wavelengths or even contributing to the herschel far - infrared emission .",
    "previous observations at 10@xmath0 mm @xcite , 6.8@xmath0 mm @xcite , and 3.2@xmath0 mm @xcite tentatively detected such excess emission at the remnant s center , with large uncertainties from image deconvolution ; high spatial resolution images from millimeter to submillimeter wavelengths are essential to disentangle the emission mechanisms .",
    "alma observations are executed according to the quality of the weather , and in general the observing requirements are more stringent the higher the frequency of the observation .",
    "sn@xmath01987a was observed during 2012 multiple times with @xmath1220 antennas in configurations containing baselines between @xmath1220@xmath0 m and @xmath12400@xmath0 m .",
    "bands 3,6,7 , and 9 ( 2.8@xmath0 mm , 1.4@xmath0 mm , 870@xmath0@xmath1 m , and 450@xmath0@xmath1 m ) were observed in approximately chronological order . band 3 : a002/x3c5ee0/x24b ( 5 apr ) , a002/x3c7a84/x1c ( 6 apr ) ; band 6 : a002/x3c8f66/x352 ( 7 apr ) , a002/x45f1dd / xd13 ( 15 jul ) , a002/x494155/x8be ( 10 aug ) ; band 7 : a002/x45e2af / x458 ( 14 jul ) , a002/x4ae797/x776 ( 24 aug ) ; band 9 : a002/x4afc39/x8ce ( 25 aug ) , a002/x4b29af / xd21 ( 27 aug ) , a002/x535168/x796 ( 05 nov ) . each dataset was calibrated individually with common astronomy software applications ( casa ; casa.nrao.edu ) .",
    "all data in a given wavelength band were then combined for imaging and deconvolution with the `` clean '' algorithm . only the channels free of bright co and sio emission were used ( 212.56 - 213.59@xmath7ghz and 100.07 - 103.91@xmath7ghz in bands 6 and 3 ) . in synthesis imaging the weighting as a function of baseline length can be adjusted , to achieve finer spatial resolution at the expense of somewhat higher noise per beam .",
    "briggs weighting was used with `` robust '' parameters and resulting gaussian restoring beams as noted in the figures .",
    "atca images were deconvolved using the maximum entropy algorithm @xcite .",
    "in figure  1 , we present the first spatially resolved submillimeter continuum observations of sn@xmath01987a , obtained with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "we can now separate emission from the torus from that of the inner ejecta at 450@xmath0@xmath1 m , 870@xmath0@xmath1 m , and 1.4@xmath0 mm .",
    "decomposition of the torus and inner ejecta was performed in the image plane .",
    "the torus was represented with the clean model ( collection of point sources or clean components ) from deconvolving the atca 6.8@xmath0 mm image .",
    "the inner ejecta were represented by the alma band  9 ( 450@xmath0@xmath1 m ) model . for each band ,",
    "the image was decomposed into a clean model and residual .",
    "the torus or ejecta model , scaled in amplitude , was subtracted from the model , which was then restored with the appropriate gaussian restoring beam , and the residual image added back in .",
    "this method results in minimal noise from the torus or ejecta observation being introduced , merely preserving the noise already present in each original image .",
    "the amplitude scaling is varied to minimize the residuals in the subtracted image .",
    "the torus and ejecta were also subtracted from each other in the fourier plane , with consistent results .",
    "the torus and ejecta flux densities measured using these independent decompositions were combined to determine the flux densities and uncertainties listed in table  [ fluxtable ] .",

    "we discuss the torus first since the physical emission mechanism , sychrotron emission from shock - accelerated particles , is less controversial than the inner ejecta emission mechanism .",
    "images of the torus alone ( central ejecta removed ) are shown in figure  [ torusfig ] .",
    "the eastern side is brighter at all ( sub)millimeter wavelengths , and the asymmetry decreases at shorter wavelengths . in contrast , h@xmath14 emission @xcite from shocks being driven into the equatorial ring , and soft x - ray emission @xcite from hot plasma behind the shocks is now brighter in the west ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "all wavelengths shown have brightened with time , and the emission distribution has become geometrically flatter in the equatorial plane , as the shocks interact with the dense ring @xcite .",
    "asymmetry results from differences in how far that interaction has progressed ( e.g. the x - ray asymmetry can be explained by faster shocks in the east ; * ? ? ?",
    "the integrated spectrum of the torus ( figure  [ sedfig ] ) is fit from 17@xmath0 mm to 870@xmath0@xmath1mby a power - law with a spectral index @xmath14 = -0.8@xmath130.1 ( f@xmath15 ) and no evident spectral break .",
    "this rules out significant synchrotron losses that would steepen the spectrum , or contamination from free - free emission that would flatten it .",
    "the spectrum is quite steep ( few high energy particles ) , compared to what would be produced by diffusive shock acceleration in the test particle limit , in a single shock at the observed @xmath122000@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath16 expansion velocity @xcite .",
    "the shock structure is therefore likely being modified by pressure from the accelerated particles @xcite or by an amplified tangled magnetic field @xcite .",

    "it is marginally resolved at 870@xmath0@xmath1 m ; constrained by the observations to have fwhm@xmath110.4 , consistent with the 450@xmath0@xmath1msize .",
    "the spectrum of the inner ejecta rises steeply with frequency , inconsistent with pwn emission , but very well modeled by dust .",
    "the alma and herschel photometry can be fit with 0.23@xmath130.05@xmath0m@xmath3 of amorphous carbon dust at 26@xmath133@xmath0k ( fig .",
    "this implies that that the carbon dust mass is much higher today than the 5@xmath910@xmath6m@xmath3 measured two years after the explosion @xcite , and that within uncertainties nearly all of the 0.23@xmath130.1@xmath0m@xmath3 of carbon @xcite released in the explosion is now in dust .",

    "our analysis of co emission observed with alma and _ herschel _ finds @xmath20.01@xmath7m@xmath3 of co in sn1987a @xcite . within uncertainties ,",
    "the carbon in dust and co does nt yet exceed the nucleosynthetic yield , but as future observations refine the co and dust masses , strong constraints may be placed on nucleosynthesis , chemistry , dust coagulation , or all three .",
    "the temperature is quite well constrained by these data , and theoretical models predict a similar temperature .",
    "cooling by adiabatic expansion and radiation is offset by heating from @xmath19ti decay and by external x - ray heating from the shocks .",
    "the current gas temperature in the absence of x - ray heating is modeled to be 20 - 100@xmath0k @xcite .",
    "models predict that significant x - rays do not yet penetrate inwards as far as the 2@xmath910@xmath10 cm radius of the alma 450@xmath0@xmath1memission @xcite .",
    "the compact and centrally peaked 450@xmath0@xmath1memission supports this interpretation , since external heating would likely result in more limb - brightened or extended dust emission .",
    "since the ionization fraction is below 1% @xcite , less than @xmath1240% of the x - ray flux will go into heating @xcite , and @xmath115% of the observed total flux 4.7@xmath910@xmath20erg@xmath0s@xmath16 @xcite is intercepted by the ejecta . even if it did reach the dusty inner core , the energy deposition would be @xmath1110% of the heating from @xmath19ti decay @xcite .",
    "the best - fit dust mass m@xmath21 scales approximately as t@xmath22 , and m@xmath230.1@xmath0m@xmath3 for t@xmath2450@xmath0k .",
    "the emission is optically thin at 450@xmath0@xmath1 m , and m@xmath21 is insensitive to unresolved clumpiness : if 0.23@xmath0m@xmath3 of dust uniformly filled a region the size of the alma emission , the peak surface density would be 0.02@xmath0g@xmath0@xmath25 , with an optical depth @xmath260.2 .",
    "if the dust is clumpy , each clump remains optically thin unless the filling fraction is less than @xmath122% ; a filling fraction of 10 - 20% was fitted to the infrared spectrum @xcite and consistent with the co clump filling factor of 0.14 fitted to alma co emission @xcite .",
    "analytical formulae for radiative transfer in dense clumps @xcite indicate that the effective optical depth of the ensemble of clumps remains low over a very wide range of clump filling fraction and number .",
    "the data can also be fit by a combination of carbonaceous and silicate ( mg@xmath27sio@xmath28 ) dust ( fig .  3 ; dotted line ) ,",
    "although the mass of carbonaceous dust can not be significantly reduced because amorphous carbon has the highest submillimeter opacity @xmath17 among minerologies similar to the interstellar medium , and eliminating it would require dust masses of other compositions larger than the available metal mass ( the best fit using pure silicate is 4@xmath0m@xmath3 at 21@xmath0k ) .",
    "although these data do not strongly constrain the mass of silicate dust , it is unlikely that only carbon condensed in the sn@xmath01987a , given the presence of large amounts of mg and si in the ejecta ( 0.065@xmath130.1 and 0.19@xmath130.1@xmath0m@xmath3 respectively ) and the detection of sio molecules at early epochs @xcite .",
    "the absence of the 10@xmath0@xmath1mfeature during days 615 - 775 puts a strong upper limit ( 15% ) on the fraction of dust which is silicates , but does not exclude the presence of some silicate dust during that epoch , since the ejecta could have been optically thick at that wavelength @xcite .",
    "the silicate mass could be much larger now , similar to the much larger carbon mass .",
    "models and observations show that core collapse supernovae like sn@xmath01987a are highly inhomogeneous , with instabilities and radioactive energy deposition mixing the initially chemically stratified stellar interior into clumps with different compositions , macroscopically mixed throughout the ejecta volume @xcite .",
    "the distribution of emission from different atoms , molecules , and dust not only reveals the chemistry of their formation , but a snapshot of the early supernova interior .",
    "the extent of dust emission corresponds well to line emission from co@xmath02 - 1 and sio@xmath05 - 4 observed simultaneously with alma @xcite .",
    "the 1 - 2@xmath910@xmath10 cm radial extent corresponds to expansion velocities of 750 - 1400@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath16 , consistent with the 1250@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath16 half - width of the co emission @xcite , and within the commonly used maximum core expansion velocity of @xmath122000@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "sio is an important precursor to forming dust , so the relative distributions of dust and sio in sn@xmath01987a that alma will be able to measure with higher spatial resolution in the future will constrain formation theories .    in the last few years , the inner ejecta have developed a complex morphology in optical and infrared emission , including north - south elongation and a `` hole '' or fainter region in the center .",
    "the 450@xmath0@xmath1memission peak is coincident with the hole , and although the optical emission is likely limb - brightened due to external x - ray heating @xcite , the dust we detect does have significant optical opacity .",
    "smooth dust would have @xmath291000 , and 100 dusty clumps filling 10% of the inner ejecta volume would have @xmath301.7 @xcite .",
    "( about 100 clumps were predicted by collapse simulations @xcite and fitted to observed optical lines @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the powerful resolution of alma to show clearly that prodigious amounts of dust have formed in the cold inner ejecta of sn@xmath01987a .",
    "our data suggests that nearly all of the carbon has condensed into dust , so condensation must be efficient .",
    "a large mass of clumpy dust was tentatively detected at 1.3@xmath0 mm 4 years after the explosion @xcite  if this is the same dust then it formed quite rapidly .",
    "if dust production in other supernovae resembles that in sn@xmath01987a , then core - collapse supernovae might contribute as much dust to galaxies as asymptotic giant branch stars . in the absence of grain destruction , dust in high - redshift galaxies can be explained with only 0.1@xmath0m@xmath3 produced per type ii sn @xcite .",
    "sn@xmath01987a has the largest measured dust mass , but a few other remnants contain almost 0.1@xmath0m@xmath3 ( cassiopeia a , @xcite ; crab nebula , @xcite ) .",
    "however , dust formed in a supernova must survive passage through the reverse shock to be dispersed into the interstellar medium , and then also survive shock passages once dispersed @xcite . the reverse shock in sn@xmath01987a located with spatially resolved h@xmath14 spectra @xcite",
    "has a minimum radius in the equatorial plane of @xmath124@xmath910@xmath10 cm , significantly larger than the 450@xmath0@xmath1memission ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the new dust has not been significantly processed by the reverse shock .",
    "models of dust destruction predict a wide range of survival fractions @xcite . if 0.23@xmath0m@xmath3 of dust is typically created in type ii supernovae , and 0.1@xmath0m@xmath3 passes through the reverse shock into the ism",

    "<S> supernova ( sn ) explosions are crucial engines driving the evolution of galaxies by shock heating gas , increasing the metallicity , creating dust , and accelerating energetic particles . in 2012 </S>",
    "<S> we used the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array to observe sn  1987a , one of the best - observed supernovae since the invention of the telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we present spatially resolved images at 450@xmath0@xmath1 m , 870@xmath0@xmath1 m , 1.4@xmath0 mm , and 2.8@xmath0 mm , an important transition wavelength range . </S>",
    "<S> longer wavelength emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation from shock - accelerated particles , shorter wavelengths by emission from the largest mass of dust measured in a supernova remnant ( @xmath20.2  m@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time we show unambiguously that this dust has formed in the inner ejecta ( the cold remnants of the exploded star s core ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dust emission is concentrated to the center of the remnant , so the dust has not yet been affected by the shocks . if a significant fraction survives , and if sn  1987a is typical , supernovae are important cosmological dust producers . </S>"
