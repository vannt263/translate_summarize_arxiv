    "recent observational evidence suggests that the star formation rate of the universe peaked at @xmath5 and that by @xmath3 half of the stellar mass of the universe today was already in place @xcite .",
    "the decreasing star formation rate , referred to as quenching , is mass dependent with the more massive galaxies being quenched earlier .",
    "also , the comparison of the most massive galaxies ( @xmath6 ) at high and low redshifts show that these quiescent galaxies have undergone a size evolution ; with the size of the galaxies increasing with decreasing redshift @xcite . this size evolution has been associated with minor mass growth , suggesting that these growths may be driven by minor merger where the size of the galaxy grows to the second power of the added mass through virial arguments , unlike major mergers where the size grows linearly to the increase in mass @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent works have pointed out that a significant part of the observed size growths in the populations of quiescent galaxies , especially at lower masses , may be due to progenitor bias , wherein the addition of large recently quenched galaxies contribute to the observed increase in the mean size of the population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of what the process for the growth of the galaxy size , and its stellar mass may be , there is strong evidence indicating that , for the most massive galaxies , most of the additional stellar mass is added to the outskirts of the galaxies , while the central regions remain mostly unperturbed @xcite .",
    "the end result of this merging process are the most massive galaxies in the nearby universe which are found to be slowly rotating @xcite , they have cores in their surface brightness profiles @xcite , and are embedded in extended stellar envelopes @xcite .",

    "details of the adopted selection criteria are presented below .",
    "[ sample ]      our first selection criterion is based on the quality flags provided by the deep2 survey catalogue , i.e. we selected galaxies that have either `` secure '' or `` very secure '' redshift estimation based on the automated and visual spectral redshift estimation by the deep2 team .",

    "galaxies passed this stage of the selection process .",
    "of these , 1,240 ( @xmath34 ) galaxies have an apparent @xmath35 .",
    "the second selection criterion is based on the quality of the galaxy spectra .",
    "we calculate the mean signal - to - noise ( @xmath36 ) of a galaxy spectrum as the median flux in the galaxy spectrum divided by the standard deviation of the residuals of the spectral fit to that spectrum . in this instance , the spectral fitting was done with a set of empirical stellar spectral library , while masking gas emission features .",
    "further details on this spectral fitting is presented in section  [ qualspec ] .",
    "we only select galaxies with @xmath37 .",
    "we further eliminate galaxies that do not appear to have significant absorption features , i.e. clear spectral absorptions which stood out visually above the noise .",
    "this selection criteria reduced the galaxy sample to 175 galaxies .",
    "our third selection criteria is based on the visual inspection of the thumbnails of the galaxies , taken from the f814w images by the _",
    "we have removed 21 irregular galaxies from our final sample as these galaxies are likely to be disturbed and would confuse the trends being investigated in this study .",
    "the selection criteria based on the galaxy spectra and imaging quality , dramatically reduces our galaxy sample to 154 galaxies .    in this study",
    ", we also create dynamical models for our galaxy sample , however this requires some additional selection criteria . to create the dynamical models we need to parametrize the photometry of our galaxies to high accuracy within the central regions from which the stellar kinematics are observed .",
    "we exclude galaxies that have disturbed photometry , such as dust lanes , or non - axisymmetric features , and hence this galaxy subsample is biased towards early - type galaxies with smooth light profiles .",
    "further details on this selection criterion is given in section  [ qualmge ] .",
    "also , the dynamical modelling of galaxies assume a spatially constant stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath38 ) , however this assumption becomes inaccurate for galaxies with multiple significant star formation events .",
    "therefore , after deriving the sfh of our galaxies , we eliminate galaxies that require more than one significant star formation episode to reproduce their spectrum .",
    "in addition to this , the atlas@xmath39  group found that young galaxies , as inferred by their strong @xmath40 absorption feature , tend to show strong gradients in the stellar @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason , these galaxies where removed from their imf studies ( * ? ?",

    "* hereafter c13b ) . in this study",
    ", we use full - spectrum fitting to the galaxy spectra to identify the best fitting single stellar population ( assuming solar metallicity ) of the galaxies .",
    "we then classify any galaxy with the best fitting population of 1.2 gyrs or younger as a young galaxy and eliminate them from our secondary sample .",
    "this narrows our secondary galaxy sample to 68 galaxies for which dynamical models were created .",
    "this sample is identical to that used in @xcite .",
    "given our strict selection criteria , our sample can not be representative of the general galaxy population at @xmath3 . to illustrate the effect of the selection criteria on the sample , in fig .",

    "we compare the galaxy samples using data from the photometric catalogue provided by the deep2 survey , which is derived from @xcite .",
    "the catalogue contains the observed @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 magnitudes of the galaxies calculated from observations made by canada - france - hawaii telescope using the cfh12k camera .",
    "the catalogue also contains an estimate of the gaussian radius of the galaxies which we use as a proxy for the size of the galaxies . for further details on the the catalogue ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ sample_plot ] , we compare the @xmath45 colour of the galaxies against their absolute @xmath43 observed band magnitude .",
    "the plot depicts the @xmath43 magnitude limit of the deep2 survey and clearly separates the blue cloud and red sequence of the field .",
    "the plot demonstrates that our sample have a higher @xmath43 cut - off than the deep2 which can be explained by the s / n cut - off that we place on our galaxy spectra .",
    "this is further demonstrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ sample_plot ] , where we plot the @xmath43 of the galaxies against a measure of the size of the galaxies . due to the design of the survey ,",
    "particularly the fact that each galaxy has a fixed exposure of @xmath46 minutes and fixed aperture size , galaxies with lower surface brightness will be of lower quality .",
    "hence , our s / n cut - off can be roughly approximated as a surface brightness cut - off .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ sample_plot ] also demonstrates that our secondary sample , indicated by the red points in the plot , is a good representation of the red sequence along with a few galaxies in the blue cloud .",
    "this is likely the consequence of the additional selection that we place on the secondary sample , whereby only galaxies with smooth light profiles and without significant star formation younger than 1.2 gyrs are selected .",
    "our full sample , indicated by the red and the blue points , appears to represent all but the bluest galaxies over a certain magnitude cut - off .",
    "this under - representation may be the result of the visual inspection of the galaxy spectra , where the presence of hydrogen emission or apparent high frequency noise make the spectrum fits look unreliable .",
    "we measure the mean @xmath36 by fitting the observed galaxy spectra with an empirical stellar spectral library . our choice for an empirical stellar library , rather than population models , to estimate the @xmath36",
    "is done to allow for maximum freedom to the optimal template combination , especially for very young ages .",
    "this avoids potential bias in the stellar velocity dispersion , which is also extracted during this step .",
    "however our results are quite insensitive to this choice , due to the rather low @xmath36 of our spectra .",
    "the spectral fitting is done using the ppxf method and code @xcite which uses a penalised maximum likelihood fitting technique in pixel space . before fitting we logarithmically rebin the observed galaxy spectrum to 60  per pixel . as templates",
    "we use a subset of empirical stellar spectra taken from the indo - us library of coud feed stellar spectra library @xcite .",

    "we use ppxf to fit for the velocity and velocity dispersion of the galaxies using 4 additive and one multiplicative polynomial . during the fit of the galaxy",
    "spectra gas emission features are masked .",
    "the residuals of the fits are found to be random , suggesting that our spectral fitting is not biased by template mismatch .    using these fits",
    ", we derive the @xmath36 of each galaxy spectra as the ratio of the median of the galaxy spectra and the standard deviations of the residuals .",
    "we remove galaxies that have @xmath49 from our final sample as we found the fits to their spectra unreliable .",
    "we derive the star formation history of our main sample of 154 galaxies via a full - spectrum fitting technique using the ppxf code @xcite . for our templates",
    ", we use the miles stellar population models @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the miles empirical stellar spectra library @xcite and have a resolution of 2.5   fwhm @xcite . to ensure realistic fits of the galaxy spectrum with the template models",
    ", we placed certain constraints on our template grid .",
    "we use stellar population models logarithmically spaced into 40 age bins within the age range of 0.087.9 gyrs to restrict the age of stellar populations to that less than the age of the universe at the redshift under study .",
    "we have also restricted our template metallicities to [ m / h ] of -0.4 , 0.0 ( solar metallicity ) and 0.22 .",
    "this constrain is based on results by @xcite where the authors studied the absorption line strengths of stacked spectra of the deep2 sample at redshifts @xmath50 and concluded that these galaxies have metallicities close to solar . since @xcite use [ fe / h ] to measure their metallicities",
    ", we should note that for our template models the [ m / h ] is equivalent to [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "for this analysis we adopt the salpeter imf @xcite for our stellar population models , however the derived trends in the sfh are insensitive to the imf choice , as demonstrated in @xcite .    in this study , we do a full - spectrum fitting for the spectral features and continuum shape of the observed galaxy spectra .",
    "this is done using four multiplicative polynomials to account for effects of reddening and calibration uncertainties in the observed galaxy spectra .",
    "the fractional weight assigned to each template indicates the fraction of the galaxy spectrum contributed by that stellar population .",
    "we do not use any additive polynomials when fitting for the stellar populations as these polynomials can artificially change the line strengths of the model templates . during the fitting with ppxf ,",

    ", the solid black line represents the one - to - one relation between the quantities . ]",
    "we derive the star formation history of the galaxies by fitting their spectra with the above mentioned template grid while enforcing a smoothness criterion on the distribution of the weights in a mass weighted manner .",
    "this smoothness criterion is enforced by penalising the @xmath54 for weight distributions with non - zero second partial derivatives . in this way , for infinite regularization",
    ", the 2-dimensional solution converges to a plane .",
    "regularization is a standard method to solve general ill - posed inverse problems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) like the recovery of the sfh from a spectrum .",
    "it is implemented in ppxf using the classic linear - regularization approach as in equation  ( 19.5.10 ) of @xcite and is enforced via the _ regul _ keyword in ppxf .",
    "the value assigned to the _ regul _ keyword specifies the strength of the penalisation of the @xmath54 . a common guideline is to penalise the model till @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the @xmath54 of the model without penalisation and @xmath57 is the number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we should note that the regularization approach is not similar to smoothing the solution after the fit .",
    "in fact regularization _ does not _ prevent sharp features in the recovered star formation or metallicity distribution , as long as these are required to fit the data .",
    "the regularization only influence the weight distribution when the solution is degenerate and many different and noisy ones can fit the data equally well . in this case",
    "the smoothest solution is preferred over the noisy ones .",
    "this is a general feature of all regularization approaches .",
    "for a few galaxies , we find the value of _ regul _ is poorly constrained by the @xmath58 criterion , due to the rather large noise in the galaxy spectra .",
    "for this reason ppxf is able to fit the spectrum using a perfectly smooth weight distribution before @xmath59 .",
    "hence , to be conservative , and to avoid our results from being driven by the regularization , we lowered the requirement on @xmath58 from the standard one mentioned above to @xmath60 .",
    "as a consistency check , we have compared the stellar masses of 151 common galaxies derived in this study and that of @xcite , where the authors use brik colour to derive the stellar mass for a sample of @xmath61 galaxies in the deep2 survey under the assumption of a chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "we calculate our galaxy stellar mass ( @xmath62 ) by multiplying the absolute luminosity of the galaxies by the @xmath63 inferred from the spectral fits @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the weight attached to the @xmath66th template by the regularised mass - weighted fit to the galaxy spectrum , @xmath67 is the mass of the template that is in stars and stellar remnants , and @xmath68 is the @xmath69-band ( vega ) luminosity of the template . please note that all m / ls derived in this study are in the b ( vega ) band .",
    "we derive this luminosity using the mge parametrization of the _ hst_/acs galaxy thumbnails , mentioned in section  [ qualmge ] , using the galaxy redshift and equation  ( 10 ) of c13b .",
    "the comparison between the 151 common galaxies is shown in fig .",

    "we see that a relation with slope unity is a good fit between the two datasets , though there is a significant offset of 0.11 dex and some scatter .",
    "the cause of the scatter and offset is likely the effect of differences in the assumed imf between the two quantities , ie this study assumes a salpeter imf while @xcite assume a chabrier imf , and the differences between the photometry and its analysis .",

    "the 68 galaxies in our modelling subsample are the same for which we created dynamical models in @xcite , and we adopt the stellar velocity dispersion from that study . the stellar kinematics were derived from the deep2 spectra within a 1 arcsec slit . in @xcite our jam models assumed the total mass is distributed like the luminous one , hence our derived dynamical",

    "* ) .    here",
    "we try two different relations between the stellar and halo mass .",
    "the first is taken from @xcite , where the authors fit a log - normal stellar - to - halo mass relation ( shmr ) , with a log - normal scatter , to the results of weak galaxy - galaxy lensing , galaxy clustering and galaxy number density analysis of the cosmos survey @xcite .",
    "we use equation  ( 13 ) of @xcite and the parameter values for model _",
    "sig_mod1 _ within the relevant redshift bin to derive the halo mass associated with a galaxy of given stellar mass .",
    "the second shmr we use is equation  ( 2 ) of @xcite . here",
    "the authors use high resolution n - body simulations to derive the dark halo mass function at different redshifts , and match them to the observed galaxy stellar mass functions , hence allowing one to derive the halo mass for a galaxy of a given stellar mass .",
    "we further assume that the dark matter of our galaxies is distributed spherically with an nfw profile @xcite .",
    "we constrain the concentration of the halo using equation  ( 12 ) of @xcite , where the authors study the evolution of the concentration of the galaxies with redshift using the bolshoi simulation . using the above equations",
    ", we calculate the nfw density profile , which is fit using the one dimensional mge fitting code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see footnote  1 ) , to use in jam .    in practice ,",
    "starting from a trial @xmath83 for a galaxy , we compute the total stellar mass by multiplication with the total luminosity .",
    "we then associate a corresponding dark halo mass using the shmr , and a nfw profile using the halo mass versus concentration relation mentioned above . for given stellar and dark matter distributions",
    "we use jam to predict the stellar @xmath84 , integrated within the adopted slit and convolved by the seeing .",
    "the model @xmath85 is matched to the observed velocity dispersion by varying the only free parameter , @xmath63 of our model , using a root finding algorithm . in this manner we account for the dark matter content of the 68 galaxies in our sample , and derive their dynamical stellar @xmath86 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    ", where we have coadded the galaxy spectra based on their stellar mass . the bin sizes of these stellar mass bins are represented here in vertical red dashed lines at stellar masses . ]    in fig.[sfh ] , we have plotted the sfh of the galaxies after having collapsed them along the metallicity axis .",
    "the galaxies are sorted along the x - axis of the plot in order of increasing stellar mass as derived by stellar population modelling . in the top panel ,",
    "we present the regularised sfh and we can clearly see that there is a gradual trend in the presented sfh with stellar mass .",
    "it appears that galaxies with low stellar mass tend to have a significant mass fraction of their stellar populations younger than 1 gyr , unlike the typical sfh of high stellar mass galaxies , where the significance of this young stellar population weakens .    for comparison in the bottom panel",
    "we have presented the unregularised mass distribution for the full - spectrum fitting of the galaxies . in this case",
    "the weights distribution is much noisier and consists of discrete peaks , as expected .",
    "but the main trend in sfh with galaxy mass can still be recognized .",
    "this shows that the recovered trend is robust .        to further illustrate this trend ,",
    "we have coadded the galaxy spectra into 3 bins : @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the full - spectrum fitting of these coadded spectra , along with their associated sfh , are shown in fig .",
    "[ weight_coadd ] .",
    "as the s / n is much higher for the coadded spectrum of the galaxies , we adopt the standard @xmath90 criterion for regularization ( for further information , please refer to section  [ sec_sfh ] ) .",
    "also , the significantly high s / n allows us to confidently fit the coadded spectra using the entire metallicity range of the miles models , [ m / h ] = -1.7 to 0.22 .",
    "we should point out that the [ m / h ] is not equivalent to [ fe / h ] for the low metallicity models , however @xcite state that the this does nt effect the galaxy age and metallicity estimates significantly .",
    "the same trend that we could see in the individual spectra appears cleaner in the stacked ones : ( i ) the most massive galaxies require a maximally old and nearly solar population to reproduce the observations , with little room for recent star formation .",
    "( ii ) the galaxies with intermediate masses still peak at the oldest ages , but allow for a more extended star formation history .",
    "( iii ) the lowest mass galaxies do not peak at the oldest ages any more and additionally show clear evidence for ongoing star formation .",
    "the well known age - metallicity degeneracy of stellar population models implies that the effect on a galaxy spectrum due to a decrease in its mean age can be negated by an increase of its metallicity @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy is reduced by the use of full - spectrum fitting , which tries to reproduce a large number of spectral features @xcite , but the general trend is still present in our recovered age and metallicity distributions .",
    "an example of this can be seen in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ weight_coadd ] : the ridge of equally - large weights going from an age of 2 gyr with nearly solar metallicity , to an age of 7 gyr with the lowest metallicity is likely due to the degeneracy , combined to our relatively narrow wavelength range . in table .  1",

    "one can simply normalize all the ssps to the same mean flux within the fitted wavelength range , before the ppxf fit .",
    "of course the luminosity weighting refer to the fitted wavelength , which in our case lies between the @xmath94 and @xmath69 band .",
    "when the ssp spectra used in the ppxf fit have the flux as given by the models , namely corresponding to a unitary stellar mass , this equation provides mass - weighted quantities .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     column ( 1 ) : deep2 galaxy identifier .",

    "this was derived by using the shmr of @xcite .    in the work presented in @xcite , the imf normalisation of the",
    "68 dynamically modelled galaxies was shown in fig .",
    "the plot illustrated that the imf normalisation for massive etgs at @xmath3 was salpeter - like , however a caveat of the work was the assumption that the dark matter fractions in the central regions of high redshift galaxies was not significant . in this study",
    "we include dark matter explicitly and in fig .",
    "[ imf_norm ] present an updated version of the plot , with the dark matter contribution explicitly removed .",
    "this confirms the assumption that dark matter fraction has a negligible effect on the imf normalisation of the galaxies , i.e. the _ average _ imf normalisation of massive etgs at redshift of @xmath95 is still consistent with a salpeter imf .",
    "this result is independent of the shmr used .",
    "this confirmation of our @xcite result is also in agreement with recent work by @xcite , where the authors have used a joint lensing and stellar dynamics modelling of massive galaxies out to @xmath96 , including about ten galaxies within our resdhift range .",
    "the authors found that the stellar imf normalisation was close to salpeter imf for @xmath97 . also , work by @xcite ,",
    "using imf sensitive spectral features , determined that more massive galaxies have a bottom heavier imf at redshifts between 0.9 and 1.5 .",
    "the salpeter normalization of the imf is also consistent with the non - universality of the imf reported in the nearby universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , if the centres of massive galaxies at @xmath3 passively evolve into the massive etgs population , their imf is expected to have a salpeter normalization as observed locally @xcite .",
    "in this study , we have determined the sfh of the galaxies at redshift @xmath1 in a non - parametric manner , using full - spectrum fitting . from a parent sample of @xmath41 galaxies from the deep2 survey ,",
    "we apply strict quality selection criteria to extract 154 galaxies with @xmath0 for which we derive our sfhs . for a subsample of 68 galaxies , with @xmath2",
    ", we additionally construct dynamical models . due to these selection criteria ,",
    "our galaxy samples have a higher magnitude cut - off than the deep2 survey and preferentially selects galaxies with high surface brightness .",
    "however , we show that the full galaxy sample is representative of the red sequence and all but the bluest galaxies of the blue cloud , while the secondary sample mainly consists of galaxies from the red sequence .",
    "the derived sfh for the full galaxy sample indicates that the most massive galaxies formed the bulk of their stars in the early epoch of the universe unlike low mass galaxies which are forming stars at a significant rate even at redshift of @xmath98 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with previous fossil record studies in the local universe , where authors have found that the star formation rate of the most massive galaxies peaked early in the age of the universe , and hence provides a robust and independent test of these results and the narrative of the formation and evolution of galaxies that these results have produced .",
    "our results based on fig .  [ sfh ] and fig .  [ weight_coadd ] demonstrate that the difference between the sfh of galaxies evolves gradually and is a function of stellar mass .",
    "we study the distribution of galaxy ages on the mass - size diagram .",
    "this demonstrates that the velocity - dispersion dependence in the age of the stellar populations of the central regions of the galaxies was already in place by @xmath3 .",
    "we also place an upper limit of a factor of @xmath99 to the size growth of individual galaxies since @xmath3 , in agreement with other studies .",
    "finally , using the dynamical models of the 68 galaxies in our secondary sample , which account for the dark matter in the galaxies using results from abundance matching techniques , we measure a median dark matter fraction @xmath100 per cent per cent , within a sphere of radius , for the most massive galaxies , with small variations depending on the adopted stellar - halo mass relation . comparing this to the dark matter fraction determined locally , we find that the dark matter fraction of galaxies has marginally increased in the last 8 gyrs , but is otherwise insignificant .",
    "this result confirm the study of @xcite stating that the average imf normalisation of the most massive galaxies is on average consistent with a salpeter imf .",
