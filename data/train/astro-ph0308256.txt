    "we conclude that the masers occur in separate clouds .",
    "the maser amplification process depends on the column density of the maser species . in this section",
    "we calculate the formaldehyde column densities from the observed maser gains .",
    "we use the level notation from appendix  a for our calculation .",
    "we find that a comparison between the column densities derived from absorption lines and maser lines indicates a relatively strong maser inversion .",
    "the gain of the maser amplification of background radiation can be expressed as ( _ e.g_.  elitzur 1992 ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the einstein @xmath102-coefficient for stimulated emission and @xmath103 is the amplification path or gain length . here",
    "we express @xmath52 in the form of equation  21 from boland & de jong ( 1981 ) , @xmath104 where @xmath105 such that a more negative number is a stronger inversion , @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the fractional abundance of ortho - formaldehyde with respect to the total density of hydrogen , and @xmath108 is the density of hydrogen .",
    "the values of the parameters used in our calculations are listed in table  10 .    for the values obtained from vlba observations ( @xmath73 and @xmath109  km  s@xmath22 ,",
    "see table  5 ) , we find @xmath110 .",
    "we derive limiting values of @xmath111 from the following arguments : ( 1 ) we consider @xmath112 to be geometrically constrained to be comparable to the radius of the region , @xmath113 . for @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath117 . (",
    "3 ) any non - thermal h@xmath0co level populations must occur in the density range @xmath118 ( green et al .",
    "1978 ) or else the level populations ` thermalize ' and any pumping is quenched .",
    "for instance , the orion - kl emission lines originate in gas of density @xmath119 which could not support non - thermal excitation ( kunter & thaddues 1971 ; johnston et al .",
    "for @xmath118 we obtain @xmath120 .",
    "the maser population inversion is defined not to exceed unity such that @xmath121 which implies @xmath122 .",
    "the limits @xmath123 may be compared with the typical inversion strength of the boland & de jong radiative pump model @xmath124 .",
    "alternately , we may assume that the column density @xmath125 in the maser gas is the same as that independently found from our absorption observations (  3.3.3 ) . from table  9 , a typical value is @xmath126 . for @xmath127",
    "k we find that @xmath128 .",
    "using @xmath129 from above we obtain @xmath130 which is consistent with the @xmath111 value reasoned from the maser gain .      a continuum radiation excitation mechanism capable of producing the high gains observed in the 6  cm masers",
    "would also be expected to affect the 2  cm doublet level populations : the relatively flat bremsstrahlung spectrum of region plasmas should excite the 6  cm and 2  cm doublets comparably ( to within an order of magnitude , see also wadiak et al .",
    "for example , the boland & de jong ( 1981 ) radiative inversion model predicts a 2  cm maser for region spectra which turnover at wavelength @xmath131  cm .",
    "however , no 2  cm maser is present (  3.3.1 ) though the spectrum of ngc  7538-irs1 is observed to turnover in the favorable @xmath131  cm range ( _ e.g_.  pratap et al .  1992 ; gaume et al .  1995 ; bloomer et al .  1998 ;",
    "momose et al .",
    "2001 ; akabane et al .",
    "2001 ) . furthermore , since formaldehyde occurs in typical column densities around most regions ( including the maser objects , _",
    "e.g_.  van der tak et al .",
    "2000 ; schier et al .  2002 ) , there is no reason on the grounds of either continuum morphology or formaldehyde abundance to expect that only the few maser - bearing regions should support a formaldehyde inversion .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the 6  cm maser inversion is due to a rare collisional excitation , not to the readily available centimeter wavelength continuum radiation which has been discussed by other authors ( _ e.g_.  pratap et al .  1992 ; pms94 ; mehringer , goss , & palmer 1994 ) .",
    "the remarkable paucity of formaldehyde masers is likely a result of selective inversion conditions such as resonant interactions with species exclusive to only a few regions . in an attempt to find unusual conditions which can explain the presence of collisionally - pumped formaldehyde masers , we discuss the shock morphology of regions .",
    "hill & hollenbach ( 1978 ) have modelled the dissociation wave and shock wave evolution of expanding regions .",
    "our maser environments most resemble their `` model 3 '' in which the density is @xmath132 and the region radius is @xmath133  cm and the ambient magnetic field @xmath134 of the model is closest to that of ngc  7538-irs1 ( hoare , private communication ; momose et al .",
    "2001 ) . for ngc  7538-irs1",
    "the model correctly predicts the observed h@xmath0 line emissivity ( @xmath135 , bloomer et al .",

    "e.g_.  deharveng et al .",
    "1979 ) , and age ( @xmath136  yr , _",
    "e.g_.  martin 1973 ) for the region .",
    "the relevant aspect of the hill & hollenbach model is that the initially faster dissociation wave is eventually overtaken by the shock wave .",
    "the epoch at which the shock passage occurs is @xmath137  yr , in good agreement with the age of the irs1 region . during the passage there exists a transition region about half - molecular in composition .",
    "also , the region contains transient phenomena such as non - equilibrium populations of various species such as cool molecular gas and hot excited atoms .",
    "evidence that these transition - shock collision regions are sufficiently rare to explain the observed paucity of formaldehyde masers is discussed by bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) .",
    "they find that for `` a broad range of parameters of interest '' ( density , shock velocity , etc . )",
    "the dissociation and shock waves are merged and there is _ no _ relative evolution of the hill & hollenbach type .",
    "however , they suggest that clumps in the ambient molecular cloud are sites where the dissociation and shock waves _ are _ separate and where time - dependent effects may become important . therefore , we suggest that formaldehyde masers occur in the small number of regions which possess ( 1 ) separately evolving dissociation and shock waves , ( 2 ) an age equal to the epoch of dissociation and shock wave passage , and ( 3 ) a neighboring molecular cloud with ambient clumps of sufficient number density and formaldehyde column density to cause time - dependent wave effects .",
    "we consider it possible that the formaldehyde maser inversion is a result of collisions between formaldehyde and a rare transient species within the relatively exotic conditions in the shock / dissociation - transition region .",
    "however , since h@xmath0co collisions with relatively rare species , such as hot h atoms or excited h@xmath0 ( _ e.g_.  green et al .",
    "1978 ) have not been fully explored , the collision cross - sections required to formulate a quantitative model are not yet available .",
    "ngc  7538 is the closest of the three sources known to have h@xmath0co masers ( @xmath138  kpc compared with g29.96 - 0.02 ( @xmath139  kpc ) and sgr  b2 ( @xmath140  kpc ) ) .",
    "also , the ngc  7538-irs1 region contains a large number of maser species .",
    "ngc  7538 is then best suited for studies targeted at understanding the h@xmath0co relationship to other maser species in close linear and angular proximity .",
    "for example , empirical correlations among the h@xmath0co , oh , and h@xmath0o maser species have prompted searches for new h@xmath0co masers ( _ e.g_.  forster et al .",

    "an understanding of the physical conditions of irs1 through the observation of other masers is valuable .",

    "the position of the non - metastable @xmath143 ( 9,6 ) maser in the irs1 region ( madden et al .",

    "maser species , like h@xmath0co , is quite rare and poorly - understood ( elitzur 1992 ) .",

    "maser has only been observed at a single epoch ; however , the nh@xmath19 ( 9,6 ) maser in w49 is known to be variable ( wilson & henkel 1988 ; huettemeister et al .",
    "future observations of nh@xmath19 in ngc  7538 could indicate ( 1 ) an accurate absolute position for the ngc  7538 @xmath143 ( 9,6 ) maser near the ngc  7538 h@xmath0co masers and/or ( 2 ) @xmath143 ( 9,6 ) maser intensity increase similar to the ngc  7538 h@xmath0co masers ( fig .",
    "8) . either ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) would suggest that the h@xmath0co and nh@xmath19 masers arise in the same volume .",
    "the h@xmath0o masers in the region have the most disparate physical conditions from the h@xmath0co ( table  11 ) .",
    "however , recent observations ( hoare , private communication ) show that the irs1 h@xmath0o masers appear related to the h@xmath0co masers .",
    "merlin observations show 9 h@xmath0o masers within 200  mas of the h@xmath0co positions .",
    "furthermore , the two h@xmath0o masers closest in position and velocity to h@xmath0co maser component ii ( @xmath144  km  s@xmath22 ) have tripled in intensity in 10 years .",
    "it is interesting to note that the h@xmath0co masers have also tripled in intensity over 10 years . since it is unlikely that the h@xmath0o and h@xmath0co masers exist in the same volume , perhaps the two species are related by a shock interaction with a clump at @xmath144  km  s@xmath22",
    "indeed , the shock - driven pumping scheme for h@xmath0o masers ( elitzur , hollenbach , & mckee 1989 ) includes molecular clumps and may be compatible with the h@xmath0co pumping mechanism we suggest using the hill & hollenbach ( 1978 ) and bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) models .",
    "we have detected and imaged the unusual h@xmath0co masers with vlbi baselines for the first time showing milliarcsecond structure ( tens of aus in linear scale ) and brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath96  k. merlin images of the ngc  7538 h@xmath0co masers show the separation between the two velocity components to be @xmath43  mas and the components appear to arise in separate clouds .",
    "we also measure a @xmath145 velocity gradient in the ngc  7538 maser gas . both ngc  7538 maser components",
    "have been shown to increase intensity on 5 - 10 year timescales despite remaining constant in intensity for the first 10 years after discovery .",

    "we suggest that the strong but rare formaldehyde inversion process involves a collisional pumping interaction .",
