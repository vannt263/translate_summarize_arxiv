    "the compton process , which refers to elastic scattering of a photon off a charged object , has played an important role in the history of quantum electrodynamics : it provided one of the early evidences that the electromagnetic wave is quantized , and hence has the nature of particles@xcite .",
    "the role of the compton process in studying the structure of hadrons has been explored since 50 s , when low s low - energy theorems @xcite , analogous to the well - known thomson cross section , are derived .",
    "those theorems assert , for instance , that at sufficiently low energy the spin - dependent part of the compton amplitude is determined by the anomalous magnetic moment of a composite system .",
    "going to higher - order terms in the low - energy expansion , one finds the electric and magnetic polarizabilities@xcite . in recent years ,",
    "experimental and theoretical works in measuring and understanding the polarizabilities of the nucleon and pion have flourished@xcite .    generally speaking , however , the compton process on a composite system is quite complicated .",
    "when a point - like constituent absorbs an incoming photon , the system becomes excited .",
    "as it propagates in time , the system eventually emits a photon and comes back to the ground state .",
    "quantum - mechanical propagation of a composite system is difficult to handle theoretically , except in spacial kinematic regions .",
    "the low - energy theorems exist for the compton scattering on the nucleon because the intermediate propagation at low energy is dominated by the nucleon itself@xcite .",
    "another kinematic region known to have simple scattering mechanism is where the @xmath1-channel momentum transfer is large , i.e. , the nucleon has a large recoil@xcite . in this case",
    ", perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to understand the intermediate propagation .",
    "in fact , according to the so - called the power counting rule@xcite , the most important intermediate states are those created from three valence quarks through hard - gluon exchanges .",
    "simple as it may be , one still has to compute hundreds of feynman diagrams to obtain the scattering cross section .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the compton scattering by a virtual photon in a special kinematic limit . assuming the virtual photon is generated by inelastic lepton scattering , we are interest in the bjorken limit , i.e. , the energy and momentum of the virtual photon going to infinity at the same rate .",
    "we shall call the process deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) . as we shall discuss in the next section ,",
    "the basic mechanism for dvcs is a quark absorbing the virtual photon , immediately radiating a real photon and falling back to the nucleon ground state .",
    "thus the physics of dvcs is quite simple .",
    "our interest in studying dvcs is generated from the fact that it offers a way to measure the off - forward parton distributions ( ofpds ) , a new type of parton distributions that generalize the usual parton distributions and the nucleon form factors .",
    "when taking moments of ofpds , one gets form factors of the spin-@xmath2 , twist - two quark and gluon operators .",
    "when going to the forward limit , ofpds become the usual quark and gluon distributions . because the spin - two , twist - two operators are part of the energy - momentum tensor of qcd and because the form factors of the energy - momentum tensor contain information about the quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin , dvcs may provide a novel way to measure the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the quark orbital angular momentum , a subject of great current interest@xcite .",
    "the presentation of the paper goes like this . in section",
    "ii , we consider dvcs in qcd at the tree level . we identify the off - forward parton distributions from the compton amplitude and then study some simple aspects of the distributions , such as sum rules . in section iii",
    ", we study the leading - log evolution of the ofpds .",
    "the results are presented in the form of generalized altarelli - parisi equations . in sections",
    "iv , we work out the cross sections for dvcs and the accompanying bethe - heitler process and their interference . to be complete , we consider all cases including unpolarized , double - spin and single - spin processes .",
    "some estimates are given at the cebaf and hermes kinematics .",
    "the final section contains comments and discussions .",
    "a preliminary account of the dvcs process is discussed in a letter paper by this author @xcite .",
    "subsequently , radyushkin studied the scaling limit at @xmath3 from a different angle @xcite . actually , processes similar to dvcs were first considered by geyer et .",
    "al . in studying the anomalous dimensions of light - ray operators",
    "@xcite , where the `` interpolating functions '' were introduced .",
    "the evolution of these functions is found to interpolate the brodsky - lepage and altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "similar objects were also considered by jain and ralston in the context of studying the violation of helicity selection rule and the effects of transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to studying the virtual compton scattering in deep - inelastic kinematics and at the leading order in perturbative qcd .",
    "the main result is that dvcs is dominated by single - quark scattering , and therefore the amplitude can be expressed in terms of the off - forward parton distributions .",
    "we also study sum rules of these distributions and show that the second sum rule is related to the total quark ( gluon ) contribution to the spin of the nucleon .",
    "we picture the virtual compton scattering in fig .",
    "1 , where a nucleon of momentum @xmath4 absorbs a virtual photon of momentum @xmath5 , producing an outgoing real photon of momentum @xmath6 and a recoil nucleon of momentum @xmath7 . we focus on the deeply - virtual kinematic region of @xmath5 , namely , the bjorken limit : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 finite . in this region , the quark that absorbs the virtual photon becomes highly virtual and hence propagates perturbatively .",
    "the simplest mechanism to form the compton final state is for the quark to promptly radiate a real photon and fall back to the nucleon ground state .",
    "this  hand - bag \" subprocess is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) .    in qcd , more complicated ",
    "tree \" subprocesses are possible . by tree ,",
    "we mean perturbative diagrams in which every vertex is next to the nucleon blob .",
    "for instance , the highly - virtual quark can interact with gluon fields in the nucleon , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) ; or it can transfer its virtuality to another quark through one - gluon exchanges , as shown in fig",
    "a detailed calculation shows that both subprocesses are suppressed by @xmath11 relative to the hand - bag diagram , except when the polarization of the gluon in fig .",
    "2(b ) is longitudinal .",
    "fortunately , in the light - cone gauge @xmath12 , the longitudinally - polarized gluons do not contribute by definition .",
    "thus in the deeply - virtual limit , the single - quark process indeed dominates the compton scattering .    of course , one can decorate the hand - bag with radiative loops , such as those shown in figs .",
    "2(d ) and 2(e ) .",
    "those diagrams in certain kinematic region produce leading - log corrections to the simple hand - bag , as we shall discuss in the next section . in other kinematic regions , they give rise to order-@xmath13 radiative corrections and hence can be ignored in the deeply - virtual limit .",
    "one exception is the gluon vertex correction for the real photon in fig .",
    "2(e ) , where as the two quark lines have momenta predominantly parallel to the photon momentum , the diagram has an infrared divergence reflecting the non - perturbative photon wave function .",
    "fortunately , a simple calculation shows that the contribution in this kinematic region is suppressed by @xmath11 relative to the hand - bag due to the hard - gluon propagator .",
    "thus , in the remainder of this section we concentrate solely on the dominant subprocess in fig .",

    "we choose @xmath5 and @xmath21 to be collinear and in the @xmath22 direction .",

    "the @xmath33 variable is analogous to the bjorken variable @xmath34 in deep - inelastic scattering and is bounded by 0 and @xmath35 .",
    "we neglect components of four vectors which do not produce large scalars in the bjorken limit . introducing the factor @xmath36 and integrating over @xmath20 and @xmath37 ,",

    "the initial nucleon and the active quark have the longitudinal momentum @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "[ in covariant gauge , the longitudinal gluons produce a gauge link @xmath47 between the two quark fields , restoring explicit gauge invariance of the light - cone correlations .",
    "here we are working in the light - cone gauge @xmath48 , hence the longitudinal gluons and the gauge link never appear .",
    "nonetheless , the result shall be taken as implicitly gauge - invariant . ]    a systematic counting indicates that the virtual compton scattering depends on twelve helicity amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the above result implies that only four of them survive the bjorken limit .",
    "an quick inspection shows all amplitudes with longitudinally - polarized virtual photons are sub - leading . for the transversely - polarized virtual photon scattering , the emitted photon retains the helicity of the incident photon at the leading order .",
    "this selection rule can serve as a useful check that deeply - virtual compton scattering is indeed dominated by the single quark process .",
    "of the four off - forward parton distributions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 conserve the nucleon helicity , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 flip the nucleon helicity .",

    "their measurement and interpretation are very interesting although they only depend on the parton distributions at @xmath217 .",
    "in this paper , we studied some basic aspects of deeply - virtual compton scattering .",
    "the motivation is that in the deeply - virtual kinematics , the scattering mechanism appears to be simple , and hence , one can learn some structural information from the process .",
    "the qcd analysis shows that it is the off - forward parton distributions that are probed . in a particular experiment , of course",
    ", one has to decide whether one is at the deeply - virtual kinematics . as we discussed in the paper , one can look at certain observables which vanish in the kinematic limit ( like @xmath218 in deep - inelastic scattering ) . those include @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 discussed in ref .",
    "one can also check the slow-@xmath117 dependence of certain scaling functions . as a first guess",
    ", one shall be at least at the deep - inelastic kinematic region , and the recoil nucleon shall be at backward angles",
    ". it would be interesting to demonstrate experimentally that the single - quark scattering mechanism is at work .",
    "one important theoretical issue is whether a factorization theorem exists for the deeply - virtual compton process .",
    "the answer is most likely yes for several reasons .",
    "first , the tree result we obtained can be easily cast into an operator product expansion .",
    "such an expansion is generally believed to be valid independent of external states .",
    "second , the radiative corrections to the tree process are quite similar to the corrections to @xmath222 , a process known to be factorizable at one loop level .",
    "nonetheless , one still has to prove explicitly the factorization theorem for dvcs , which will be done in a separate publication .",
    "a factorization proof for a similar process , electroproduction of mesons , has appeared recently @xcite .",
    "dvcs at small @xmath84 is especially interesting , because the nucleon form - factor suppression is small and because @xmath223 limit is relevant to the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "however , due to qed infrared divergences , the bethe - heitler process becomes dominant there despite the fact that the dvcs cross section scales like the deep - inelastic scattering cross section .",
    "thus one can not go to too small @xmath84 .",
    "one may get around this to some extent by isolating the dvcs and bh interference term through single - spin asymmetry and/or combined lepton - antilepton scattering .",
    "theoretical study of @xmath84 dependence of the ofpds , in particular , its relation to the meson - dominance and the exponential decay law for exclusive cross sections , is urgently needed .",
    "the ofpds depend on four independent variables : the bjorken - type of variable @xmath33 , the feynman - type variable @xmath82 , the momentum transfer @xmath84 and the virtual - photon mass @xmath117 .",
    "it is unlikely that one can learn the entire parameter space of the distributions in one kind of experiments . as our formulas show , different kinds of experiments are sensitive to different combinations of parton distributions and hence they are complementary .",
    "[ the reason that the nucleon helicity - flip distributions contribute to unpolarized scattering is similar to that the pauli - form factor @xmath55 appears in unpolarized elastic scattering .",
    "] however , to be able to study sum rules , one must have accurate data in an extended kinematic region . to achieve this",
    ", one must have dedicated experiments at a suitable machine like elfe for extended running @xcite .",
    "the off - forward parton distributions can also be defined for quark helicity - flip ( chiral - odd ) correlations and for higher twists .",
    "dvcs provides one process to access to these distributions .",
    "there are other processes one can consider to measure them . for instance , the diffractive @xmath224 or @xmath225 production studied by brodsky et al.@xcite can be used to measure the off - forward gluon distributions .",
    "recently , radyushkin has published a paper aimed at this direction@xcite .",
