    "a long - standing challenge on the road to superconducting applications is the unwanted motion of vortices , quanta of magnetic flux @xmath7 which penetrate a type - ii superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "each vortex consists of a circulating supercurrent which decays radially on the length scale of the penetration depth @xmath8 , and a core of suppressed superconductivity with radius given by the coherence length @xmath9 .",
    "when a current is applied to the superconductor , the vortices experience a lorentz force density @xmath10 , perpendicular to the direction of the current and proportional to its magnitude .",
    "although the net supercurrent remains non - dissipative , the accompanying motion of the normal electrons in the vortex cores causes resistance and energy loss in the material .",
    "a vortex can be pinned by co - locating its energetically costly core with a preexisting crystal defect where superconductivity is already suppressed .",
    "the strength of the pinning force density @xmath11 dictates the maximum supercurrent which can be applied without vortex motion and consequent dissipation .",
    "several decades of engineering effort have been devoted to optimizing vortex pinning in superconductors.@xcite however , vortex pinning in the highest-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors remains challenging , due in part to the large electronic anisotropy which allows vortices to bend and depin in pancake fragments rather than as one - dimensional semi - rigid objects.@xcite    the recent discovery of high-@xmath2 iron - based superconductors ( fe - scs ) brought new optimism to the vortex pinning problem.@xcite fe - scs were found to be typically more isotropic than their cuprate cousins.@xcite furthermore , intrinsic pinning tests showed promise,@xcite raising hopes that defect engineering could improve the pinning properties to achieve critical currents larger than the cuprate benchmark around @xmath12a/@xmath5.@xcite    maximizing critical current will require detailed understanding of the pinning efficacy of specific defects .",
    "transport measurements yield information about macroscopic critical currents but can not directly distinguish the distribution of pinning forces and the sites responsible for the strongest pinning .",
    "furthermore , the dissipative motion of small numbers of vortices may not be detected by macroscopic transport measurements .",
    "it is crucial to understand and quantify pinning at the single vortex level .",
    "an important parameter in this endeavor is @xmath8 , the fundamental length scale of magnetic interactions , whose absolute value has remained challenging to measure via bulk techniques due to pervasive inhomogeneity in fe - scs .    while scanning tunneling microscopy,@xcite bitter decoration,@xcite and scanning squid@xcite techniques can image vortex configurations and offer some insight into pinning , magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) is the most powerful technique to directly quantify the single - vortex depinning force @xmath13 and the in - plane penetration depth @xmath14 .",
