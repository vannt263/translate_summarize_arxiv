    "although the formation of very massive stars remains an unsolved problem of astrophysics ( zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) , the past decade has seen a shift from a belief that there is no observational upper stellar mass cutoff ( e.g. massey 2003 ) to the widespread acceptance of a limit close to 150 m@xmath3 ( figer 2005 ; koen 2006 ) .",
    "if stars above this limit were to exist , they would be exclusive to the youngest , highest mass star clusters , which are very compact ( figer 2005 )",
    ". however , spatially resolved imaging of such clusters is currently exclusive to the milky way and its satellite galaxies , where they are very rare .",
    "in addition , the accurate determination of stellar masses generally relies upon spectroscopic and evolutionary models , unless the star is a member of an eclipsing binary system ( moffat 2008 ) , something which occurs extremely rarely .",
    "most , if not all , stars form in groups or clusters ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "an average star forms with an initial mass of @xmath50.5 m@xmath3 while the relative proportion of stars of higher and lower mass obeys an apparently universal initial mass function ( imf , kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , there appears to be a relationship between the mass of a cluster and its highest - mass star ( weidner & kroupa 2006 , weidner et al .",
    "high mass stars ( @xmath68 m@xmath3 ) , ultimately leading to core - collapse supernovae , usually form in clusters exceeding  100 m  @xmath3 while stars approaching 150 m@xmath3 have been detected in two  10@xmath7 m@xmath3 milky way clusters , namely the arches ( figer 2005 ; martins et al . 2008 ) and ngc 3603 ( schnurr et al .",
    "2008a ) . is this 150 m@xmath3 limit statistical or physical ?",
    "the determination of stellar masses of very massive stars from colour - magnitude diagrams is highly unreliable , plus corrections to present mass estimates need to be applied to estimate initial masses .",
    "studies are further hindered by severe spatial crowding within the cores of these star clusters ( maz apellniz 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , sophisticated techniques are required to extract the physical parameters of early - type stars possessing powerful stellar winds from optical / infrared spectroscopy ( conti et al .",
    "2008 ) . in general",
    ", the incorporation of line blanketing has led to a reduction in derived temperatures for o stars from photospheric lines ( puls et al .",
    "2008 ) while the reverse is true for emission lines in wolf - rayet stars ( crowther 2007 ) .",
    "here we re - analyse the brightest members of the star cluster ( hd 97950 ) responsible for ngc 3603 , motivated in part by the case of a1 which is an eclipsing binary system , whose individual components have been measured by schnurr et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "we also re - analyse the brightest members of r136 ( hd 38268 ) - the central ionizing cluster of the tarantula nebula ( 30 doradus ) within the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "r136 is sufficiently young ( massey & hunter 1998 ) and massive ( @xmath85.5 @xmath9 10@xmath7 m@xmath3 , hunter et al . 1995 ) within the local group of galaxies to investigate the possibility of a physical limit beyond 150 m@xmath3 ( massey & hunter 1998 , selman et al .",
    "1999 ; oey & clarke 2005 ) .",
    "as recently as the 1980s , component ` a ' within r136 was believed to be a single star with a mass of several thousand solar masses ( cassinelli et al .",
    "1981 ; savage et al .",
    "1983 ) , although others favoured a dense star cluster ( moffat & seggewiss 1983 ) . the latter scenario was supported by speckle interferometric observations ( weigelt & bauer 1985 ) and subsequently confirmed by hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging ( hunter et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    ".log of spectroscopic observations of r136 and ngc  3603 stars used in this study [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ vms ] we present a compilation of stars in r136 ( 30 doradus ) , ngc  3603 and the arches cluster whose initial masses challenge the currently accepted upper mass limit of @xmath5150 m@xmath3 .",
    "although the formation of high mass stars remains an unsolved problem in astrophysics ( zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) , there are no theoretical arguments in favour of such a limit at 150 m@xmath3 ( e.g. klapp et al .",
    "1987 )  indeed massey & hunter ( 1998 ) argued against an upper stellar limit based on r136 itself .",
    "observations of the arches cluster provide the primary evidence for such a sharp mass cutoff ( figer 2005 ) . however , as table  [ vms ] illustrates , contemporary photometry and foreground extinction towards the cluster coupled with the spectroscopy results from martins et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggest 45 stars initially exceed @xmath10150 m@xmath3 , with an estimate of @xmath11185 m@xmath3 for the most luminous star .",
    "recall martins et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used identical spectroscopic tools to those employed in the current study , plus near - ir spectroscopic observations which also form a central component of our study .",
    "on this basis the arches cluster would no longer be a statistical oddity .",
    "monte carlo simulations for various upper stellar mass limits permit estimates of the revised threshold from which @xmath5300 m@xmath3 is obtained .",
    "it may be significant that both ngc 3603 and r136 are consistent with an identical upper limit , in spite of their different metallicities .",
    "oey & clarke ( 2005 ) obtained an upper limit of @xmath12500 m@xmath3 , primarily from a maximum stellar mass of 120  200 m@xmath3 inferred for stars within r136a itself at that time .",
    "would there be any impact of an upper mass limit of order @xmath5300 m@xmath3 on astrophysics ?",
    "population synthesis studies are widely applied to star - forming regions within galaxies , for which an upper mass limit of @xmath5 120 m@xmath3 is widely adopted ( leitherer et al .",
    "a number of properties are obtained from such studies , including star formation rates , enrichment of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) through mechanical energy through winds , chemical enrichment and ionizing fluxes . a higher stellar mass limit",
    "would increase their global output , especially for situations in which rapid rotation leads to stars remaining at high stellar temperatures .",
    "could the presence of very high mass stars , such as those discussed here , be detected in spatially unresolved star clusters ?",
    "the high luminosities of such stars inherently leads to the development of very powerful stellar winds at early evolutionary phases ( 12 myr ) .",
    "therefore the presence of such stars ensures that the integrated appearance of r136a ( and the core of ngc 3603 ) exhibits broad heii @xmath134686 emission , which at such early phases would not be the case for a lower stellar limit .",
    "other high mass clusters , witnessed at a sufficiently early age , would also betray the presence of very massive stars through the presence of heii emission lines at @xmath131640 and @xmath134686 .",
    "hitherto , such clusters may have been mistaken for older clusters exhibiting broad helium emission from classical wolf - rayet stars .",
    "finally , how might such exceptionally massive stars end their life ?",
    "this question has been addressed from a theoretical perspective ( heger et al . 2003 ) , suggesting neutron star remnants following type ib / c core - collapse supernovae close to solar metallicities , with weak supernovae and black hole remnants at lmc compositions .",
    "rapid rotation causes evolution to proceed directly to the classical wolf - rayet phase , whereas slow rotators , such as the ngc 3603 wn6h stars , will likely produce a @xmath14 car - like luminous blue variable phase .",
    "extremely metal - deficient stars exceeding @xmath5140 m@xmath3 may end their lives prior to core - collapse ( bond et al . 1984 ) .",
    "they would undergo an electron - positron pair - instability explosion during the advanced stages that would trigger the complete disruption of the star ( heger & woosley 2002 ) .    until recently ,",
    "such events have been expected from solely metal - free ( population iii ) stars , since models involving the collapse of primordial gas clouds suggest preferentially high characteristic masses as large as several hundred m@xmath3 ( bromm & larson 2004 ) .",
    "langer et al . (",
    "2007 ) have demonstrated that local pair - instability supernovae could be produced either by slow rotating moderately metal - poor ( @xmath8 1/3 z@xmath3 ) yellow hypergiants with thick hydrogen - rich envelopes  resembling sn 2006gy ( ofek et al .",
    "2007 ; smith et al . 2007 )  or rapidly rotating very metal - deficient ( @xmath15 z@xmath3 ) wolf - rayet stars .",
    "therefore it is unlikely any of the stars considered here are candidate pair - instability supernovae .",
    "nevertheless , the potential for stars initially exceeding 140 m@xmath3 within metal - poor galaxies suggests that such pair - instability supernovae could occur within the local universe , as has recently been claimed for sn 2007bi ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2009 , see also langer 2009 ) .",
    "finally , close agreement between our spectroscopically derived mass - loss rates and theoretical predictions allows us to synthesise the zams appearance of very massive stars .",
    "we find that the very highest mass progenitors will possess an emission - line appearance at the beginning of their main - sequence evolution due to their proximity to the eddington limit .",
    "as such , spectroscopic dwarf o23 stars are not anticipated with the very highest masses .",
    "of course the only direct means of establishing stellar masses is via close binaries . for the lmc metallicity , massey et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have obtained dynamical masses of a few systems , although spectroscopic and photometric searches for other high - mass , eclipsing binaries in 30 doradus are in progress through the vlt - flames tarantula survey ( evans et al .",
    "2010a ) and other studies ( o. schnurr et al . in prep . )",
    "nevertheless , it is unlikely that any other system within 30 doradus , or indeed the entire local group of galaxies will compete in mass with the brightest components of r136 discussed here .",
