    "calculations of form factors often retain in a first approximation the single - particle current ( impulse approximation ) . in most approaches ,",
    "this contribution has to be completed by at least two - body currents , especially to fulfil current conservation .",
    "this also holds for relativistic approaches where a covariant calculation of the single - particle current does not necessarily imply that physics is properly accounted for . for each relativistic approach , it is therefore important to test the degree of validity by comparing its predictions to a case where an exact calculation can be performed . neglecting vertex and mass corrections , as usually done on the basis that they are partly incorporated in the physical inputs , such an exact calculation is generally believed to be provided by the bethe - salpeter equation with an appropriate interaction kernel .",
    "a particular case of interest is the wick - cutkosky model @xcite , where the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite is solved in the ladder approximation while the interaction kernel results from the exchange of a scalar zero - mass boson between two distinguishable scalar particles . solutions can be obtained relatively easily due to an extra hidden symmetry . using the expressions of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes , calculations of form factors",
    "can be performed for the lowest bound states that we intent to consider here .",
    "contrary to other approaches , there is no need to add two - body currents .",
    "the contribution of the single - particle current is sufficient in the present model to ensure current conservation , which can be checked with the expressions of the matrix elements of the current .",
    "this model was used by karmanov and smirnov as a test of the description of form factors in the light - front approach for systems composed of scalar particles with small binding energy @xcite .",
    "they used the non - relativistic expression , @xmath0 , for the binding energy , which differs from the exact one , but this does not seem to affect their conclusion .",
    "interestingly enough , the comparison of the exact calculation with the non - relativistic one does not show much difference up to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the constituent mass . beyond",
    ", relativistic corrections with a log character slowly begin to show up .",
    "we propose to make a similar test for the point form of relativistic quantum mechanics , which is one of the forms proposed by dirac , beside the instant and the light - front forms @xcite .",
    "this form , which is much less known than the other two , has been developed in @xcite and recently used for a calculation of form factors of the deuteron @xcite and the nucleon @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the form factors decrease faster with @xmath3 than the non - relativistic ones . in the first case ,",
    "the discrepancy with experiment tends to increase while , in the other one , it almost vanishes .",
    "we will not extend in this letter on the questions that are raised by this last observation .",
    "we will only present a few results which , by themselves , are quite significant .",
    "a more complete analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we calculate the ground - state ( @xmath4 ) form factor as well as a transition form factor to the first radial excited state .",
    "different couplings are considered , corresponding to states weakly , moderately and strongly bound ( @xmath5 in terms of the qed coupling ) .",
    "the last value implies a total zero mass of the system , which is an extreme ( unphysical ) case , nevertheless interesting to look at , too .",
    "momentum transfers , @xmath3 , up to 10 times the constituent mass squared , @xmath6 , are considered .",
    "these different cases will provide a sample of results which are significant enough to test the validity of the single - current approximation in the point - form approach and give insight on the results presented in refs .",

    "this agreement extends up to @xmath78 with an error of 20% for @xmath63 and 50% for @xmath79 .",

    "these results for an inelastic transition complement those for the elastic case .",
    "again , a large discrepancy with exact results appears , but the bad behaviour of form factors at low as well as large momentum transfers is more clearly correlated with a violation of current conservation .",
    "the present study was motivated by the necessity to check the reliability of retaining the single - particle current for the calculation of form factors in the point form of quantum relativistic mechanics , which was recently employed in different works @xcite . with this aim",
    ", we considered a simple model where the exact result is known .",
    "it was found that the non - relativistic approach does particularly well up to momentum transfers of 3 - 4 times the constituent mass , including the case of a strong binding . while the point - form approach does correctly for small bindings and small couplings , large discrepancies with the exact results appear as soon as the momentum transfer or the coupling increases .",
    "detailed examination evidences three features .",
    "+ - the form factors decrease more rapidly than they should .",
    "this points to an extra @xmath98 dependence that is absent in the exact calculation .",
    "+ - for strong couplings , corresponding to a sizeable presence of high momentum components in the wave function , the charge radius turns out to be much larger than the exact one .",
    "+ - finally , as emphasised by the results for an inelastic transition , current conservation is strongly violated .",
    "although it is not quite certain , there is good reason to believe that the non - relativistic calculation does relatively well because it fulfils current conservation . with this respect ,",
    "the failure of the point - form approach is likely to reside in the incomplete character of the current operator .",
    "current conservation may be enforced by the replacement @xmath99 apart from the unsatisfactory character of this recipe , due to the presence of a pole at @xmath100 , it does not solve the problem of the too fast drop - off of the elastic charge form factor at high @xmath3 .",
    "most probably , two - body currents have to be considered .",
    "this is consistent with the known fact that , in the point form approach , the interaction appears in all the components of the 4-momentum operator @xcite .",
    "whether a minimal set of two - body currents will be sufficient to provide results in better agreement with the exact ones is not clear however .",
    "these currents should also correct for the failure of the point - form results to reproduce the born amplitude expected from the underlying field - theory model .",
    "the above results can not be applied directly to the calculation of the deuteron or nucleon form factors @xcite .",
    "however , the qualitative similarity in the results strongly suggests that the kinematical boost , which provided a nice description of the nucleon form factors , represents an incomplete account of relativistic effects .",
    "more likely , the agreement is the consequence of neglecting significant contributions to the current .",
    "this conclusion is to be preferred with two respects .",
    "+ - it leaves some room for the well known contribution of the coupling of the nucleon to the photon through vector - meson exchange ( vector - meson dominance mechanism ) , which roughly provides half of the proton s squared charge radius .",
    "+ - on the other hand , it leaves room for another relativistic effect related to the nature of the coupling of the constituents to the exchanged boson .",
    "this effect increases the form factor at high @xmath3 rather than the opposite as in ref .",
    "it is known to explain the different asymptotic form factors in a non - relativistic and a relativistic calculation in qcd , which scale like @xmath101 and @xmath87 , respectively ( see for instance refs .",
