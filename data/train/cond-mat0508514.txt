    "examples of phase transitions mediated by the unbinding of defect pairs abound in two dimensions . the quasi- longranged- order to disorder transition in the xy and planar rotor models@xcite , the melting transition of a two dimensional solid@xcite , the superconductor to normal phase transition in two dimensional josephson junction arrays@xcite , the commensurate- incommensurate transition of the striped phase of smectic liquid crystals on anisotropic substrates@xcite , and the more recent discovery of a defect mediated re - entrant freezing transition in two dimensional colloids in an external periodic potential @xcite are all understood within such defect unbinding theories . while the very first defect mediated transition theory for the phase transition in the xy - model by kosterlitz and thouless ( kt)@xcite enjoyed almost immediate acceptance and was verified in simulations@xcite as well as experiments@xcite , defect mediated theories of two dimensional melting took a long time to gain general acceptance in the community@xcite .",
    "there were several valid reasons for this reticence however .",
    ".1 cm firstly , as was recognized even in the earliest papers@xcite on this subject , the dislocation unbinding transition , which represents an instability of the solid phase , may always be pre - empted by a first order@xcite transition from a metastable solid to a stable liquid .",
    "whether such a first order melting transition actually occurs or not depends on the temperature of instability @xmath1 ; so that if the transition temperature @xmath2 the unbinding of dislocations does not occur . clearly , neither this condition nor its converse can hold for all 2d systems in general since @xmath1 is a non - universal number which depends on the `` distance '' in coupling parameter space between the bare and the fixed point hamiltonian and hence on the details of the interaction .",
    "secondly , the renormalization group flow equations derived in all defect mediated theories to date are perturbative expansions in the defect density ( fugacity ) in the ordered phase .",
    "how fast does this perturbation series converge ?",
    "again , the answer lies in the position of the bare hamiltonian in the coupling parameter space . for the planar rotor model@xcite ,",
    "past calculations show that next to leading order terms in the flow equations are essential to reproduce the value of the transition temperature obtained in simulations@xcite .",
    "thirdly , defect mediated transitions predict an essential singularity@xcite of the correlation length at the transition temperature .",
    "this means that effects of finite size@xcite would be substantial and may thoroughly mask the true thermodynamic result .",
    "a rapid increase of the correlation length also implies that the relaxation time diverges as the transition temperature is approached ",
    "critical slowing down .",
    "for the two dimensional solid , this last effect is particularly crucial since , even far from the transition , the motion of defects is mainly thermally assisted and diffusional and therefore slow .",
    "the equilibration of defect configurations@xcite is therefore often an issue even in solids of macroscopic dimensions .",
    ".1 cm on the other hand , over the last few years it has been possible to test quantitatively some of the non - universal predictions of defect mediated theories of phase transitions using simulations of restricted systems@xcite .",
    "a simulation of a system without defects is used to obtain the values for the bare coupling constants which are then taken as inputs to the renormalization group equations for the appropriate defect unbinding theory to obtain quantities like the transition temperature .",
    "needless to say , the simulated system does not undergo a phase transition and therefore problems typically related to diverging correlation lengths and times do not occur .",
    "numerical agreement of the result of this calculation with that of unrestricted simulations or experiments is proof of the validity of the rg flow equations@xcite .",
    "this idea has been repeatedly applied in the past to analyze defect mediated phase transitions in the planar rotor model@xcite , two dimensional melting of hard disks@xcite and the re - entrant freezing of hard disks in an external periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the last system is particularly interesting in view of its close relation with experiments on laser induced re - entrant freezing transition in charge stabilized colloids @xcite and this constitutes the subject of the present paper as well .",
    ".1 cm in this paper we show in detail how restricted simulations of systems of particles interacting among themselves via a variety of interactions and with a commensurate external periodic potential can be used to obtain phase diagrams showing the re - entrant freezing transition .",
    "the results obtained are compared to earlier unrestricted simulations for the same systems .",
    "briefly our results are as follows .",
    "firstly , we observe that , as in an earlier study of the planar rotor model@xcite , next to leading order corrections to the renormalization flow equations are _ essential _ to reproduce even the gross features of the phase diagram .",
    "specifically , the re - entrant portion of the phase diagram can be reproduced _ only _ if such correction terms are taken into account .",
    "secondly while we find almost complete agreement with earlier results for the hard disk system which has been studied most extensively , our phase diagram for the other forms of interaction is shifted with respect to the results available in the literature .",
    "this may mean either of two things  inadequacy of the rg theory used by us or finite size effects in the earlier results .",
    "lastly , as a by product of our calculations , we have obtained the core energy for defects ( dislocations ) in these systems and studied its dependence on thermodynamic and potential parameters .",
    ".1 cm the problem of re - entrant freezing transition of a system of interacting colloidal particles in a periodic potential has an interesting history involving experiments@xcite , simulations@xcite and theory@xcite .",
    "in last couple of decades soft systems like colloids have been studied extensively@xcite both for their own sake and as typical toy models to study various important condensed matter questions like structural and phase transitions through experiments that allow real space imaging .",
    "charged colloids confined within two glass plates form a model 2-d system as the electrostatic force from the plates almost completely suppresses the fluctuations of colloids perpendicular to the plates , practically confining them to a 2-d plane . in their pioneering experiment chowdhury@xcite",
    "imposed a simple static background potential which is periodic in one direction and constant in the other ( except for an overall gaussian profile of intensity- variation ) by interfering two laser beams .",
    "this potential immediately induces a density modulation in the colloidal system .",
    "the potential minima are spaced to overlap with the close packed lines of the ideal lattice of the colloidal system at a given density . with increase in potential strength such a colloidal liquid",
    "has been observed to solidify .",
    "this is known as laser induced freezing ( lif ) .",
    "in a recent experiment@xcite it has been shown that with further increase in potential strength , surprisingly , the solid phase re - melts to a modulated liquid .",
    "this phenomenon is known as re - entrant laser induced freezing ( rlif ) .",
    "qualitatively , starting from a liquid phase , the external periodic potential immediately induces a density modulation , reducing fluctuations which eventually leads to solidification .",
    "further increase in the amplitude of the potential reduces the system to a collection of decoupled 1-d strips .",
    "the dimensional reduction now _",
    "increases _ fluctuations remelting the system .",
    ".1 cm the early mean field theories , namely , landau theory@xcite and density functional theory@xcite predicted a change from a first order to continuous transition with increase in potential strength and failed to describe the re - entrant behavior , a conclusion seemingly confirmed by early experiments@xcite and some early simulations@xcite .",
    "overall , the results from early simulations remained inconclusive however , while one of them@xcite claimed to have found a tri - critical point at intermediate laser intensities and re - entrance , later studies refuted these results @xcite .",
    "all of these studies used the change in order parameter and the maximum in the specific heat to identify the phase transition points . while the later studies@xcite found rlif for hard disks they reported laser induced freezing and absence of any re - entrant melting for the dlvo potential@xcite in direct contradiction to experiments@xcite .",
    ".1 cm following the defect mediated disordering approach of kosterlitz and thouless @xcite(kt ) , frey , nelson and radzihovsky@xcite(fnr ) proposed a detailed theory for the re - entrant transition based on the unbinding of dislocations with burger s vector parallel to the line of potential minima . this theory predicted rlif and no tricritical point .",
    "the results of this work were in qualitative agreement with experiments@xcite and provided a framework for understanding rlif in general .",
    "more accurate simulation studies on systems of hard disks@xcite , soft disks@xcite , dlvo@xcite etc . confirmed the re - entrant freezing - melting transition in agreement with experiments@xcite and fnr theory@xcite . in these studies",
    "the phase transition point was found from the crossing of binder - cumulants@xcite of order parameters corresponding to translational and bond- orientational order , calculated for various sub- system sizes . a systematic finite size scaling analysis@xcite of simulation results for the 2-d hard disk system in a 1-d modulating potential showed , in fact , several universal features consistent with the predictions of fnr theory .",
    "it was shown in these studies that the resultant phase diagram remains system size dependent and the cross- over to the zero field kthny melting@xcite plays a crucial role in understanding the results for small values of the external potential . while the data collapse and critical exponents were consistent with kt theory for stronger potentials , for weaker potentials they match better with critical scaling@xcite . a common problem with all the simulation studies",
    "might be equilibration with respect to dislocation movements along climb ( or even glide ) directions . also , non universal predictions , namely the phase diagram are difficult to compare because the fnr approach ( like kt theory ) is expressed in terms of the appropriate elastic moduli which are notoriously time - consuming to compute near a continuous phase transition .",
    "diverging correlation lengths and times near the phase transition point further complicate an accurate evaluation of the non universal predictions of the theory .",
    ".2 cm we calculate the phase diagrams of three different 2-d systems with a 1-d modulating potential ( see fig .  [ cartoon ] ) following the technique of restricted monte carlo simulations@xcite , to be discussed below . for the laser induced transition we use this method to generate whole phase diagrams .",
    "we reject monte carlo moves which tend to distort an unit cell in a way which changes the local connectivity@xcite .",
    "the percentage of moves thus rejected is a measure of the dislocation fugacity@xcite .",
    "this , together with the elastic constants of the dislocation free lattice obtained separately , are our inputs ( bare values ) to the renormalization flow equations@xcite to compute the melting points and hence the phase diagram .",
    "our results ( fig .",

    ", we find , the predictions of fnr theory to be valid .",
    ".2 cm    in section [ method ] we first briefly discuss the fnr theory and then go on to show in detail the restricted simulation scheme used by us to obtain the various quantities required to calculate the phase diagram . in section [ result ]",
    "we give the simulation results .",

    "[ cartoon ] ) the displacement mode @xmath15 becomes massive , leaving massless @xmath16 modes . after integrating out the @xmath15 modes the free energy of the lfs may be expressed in terms of gradients of @xmath16 and elastic moduli@xcite , namely , the young s modulus @xmath17 and shear modulus @xmath18 , @xmath19 \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] .2 cm similar arguments@xcite show that among the three sets of low energy dislocations available in the 2-d triangular lattice , only those ( type i ) with burger s vector parallel to the line of potential minima survive at large @xmath20 .",
    "dislocations with burger s vector pointing along the other two possible close - packed directions ( type ii ) in the 2-d triangular lattice have larger energies because the surrounding atoms are forced to ride the crests of the periodic potential@xcite . within this set of assumptions ,",
    "the system therefore shares the same symmetries as the xy model .",

    "i.e. _ the dislocation of type i. the corresponding theory for phase transitions can then be recast as a kt theory@xcite and is described in the framework of a two parameter renormalization flow for the spin - wave stiffness @xmath31 and the fugacity of type i dislocations @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a measure of length scale as @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the size of the system . the flow equations are expressed in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the core energy of type i dislocations which is obtained from the dislocation probability@xcite . keeping upto next to leading order terms in @xmath39 the renormalization group flow equations@xcite are , @xmath40 flows in @xmath33 generated by the above equations starting from initial or `` bare '' values of @xmath41 and @xmath39 fall in two categories . if , as @xmath42 , @xmath39 diverges , the thermodynamic phase is disordered ( i.e. ml ) , while on the other hand if @xmath39 vanishes , it is an ordered phase ( a lfs)@xcite .",
    "the two kinds of flows are demarcated by the _ separatrix _ which marks the phase transition point . for the linearized equations , that keeps upto only the leading order terms in @xmath39 ,",

    "this is achieved as follows@xcite .",
    "we monitor individual random moves of the particles in a system and look for distortions of the neighboring unit cells .",

    "@xmath188 predicts the system to be in solid phase for any arbitrarily small amount of external potential and to melt at larger @xmath20 .",
    "this behaviour contradicts physical expectation that the melting density at @xmath151 has to be larger than that at @xmath204 . on the other hand , while @xmath205 does not produce any unphysical prediction , it shrinks the region of re - entrance in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "therefore @xmath201 is the minimum value for @xmath57 that could be chosen to produce physically meaningful results and this choice remains in closest agreement with simulation data .",
    "we have presented a complete numerical renormalization group scheme to calculate phase diagrams for 2-d systems under a commensurate modulating potential .",

    "we show that the re - entrance behavior is built into the ` bare ' quantities themselves .",
    "we find extremely good agreement with earlier simulation results .",
    "in particular the phase diagram for hard disk comes out to be exactly the same as found from one set of earlier simulations@xcite.to obtain the correct phase diagram , however , flow equations need to be correct at least upto next to leading order terms in the dislocation fugacity .",
