    "option pricing lies , from the very beginning , at the heart of mathematical finance as scientific discipline . in 1900",
    ", bachelier proposed the arithmetic brownian motion for the dynamical evolution of stock prices as a first step towards obtaining a price for options @xcite . since then and specially after the landmark work of black and scholes @xcite and merton @xcite , the underlying asset of any option is usually assumed to be driven by brownian motion , being the most ubiquitous model the geometric brownian motion ( gbm ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the price of stock ( or the value of an index ) at time @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the drift , @xmath4 is the volatility and @xmath5 is gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation @xmath6 .",
    "associated with stock price @xmath1 there is another random process : the return . in continuos - time finance",
    "this is defined by @xmath7 . for",
    "the gbm ( [ gbm ] ) one can see , after using it lemma @xcite , that the return obeys the following sde @xmath8 from which we see that @xmath9 is the mean return rate .",
    "since , by definition , the initial return is zero , then in terms of the integral of @xmath5 which is taken in the it sense , we can explicitly write the return as @xmath10 where the integral of @xmath5 appearing in the rhs of this equation is simply the wiener process @xmath11 .",
    "note that , independently of the stock price @xmath12 , the return at initial time @xmath13 is always zero since @xmath14 .    however , the market model given by eq .",
    "( [ gbm ] ) or eqs .",
    "( [ gbmr])([gbmrsol ] ) does not fully account for all properties observed in real markets .",
    "some of them are quite crucial such as the existence of heavy tails and negative skewness in probability distributions , evidence of self - scaling ( at least for high frequency data ) @xcite , leverage @xcite and even the existence of mild correlations in the increments of return @xcite .",
    "all of this , undoubtedly has to affect option pricing .",
    "therefore , the theoretical price for the option obtained through the assumption that markets are governed by the gbm would not be adjusted to reality .",
    "our main objective here is to elucidate how some of the above properties of real markets may affect the price of options .",
    "specifically we will obtain an option price for market models that present fat tails and self - scaling .",
    "after that , we will relax the so called efficient market hypothesis @xcite and assume the existence of auto correlations in stock prices .",
    "we restrict the analysis to european call options , although it can be easily generalized to the european put and other options with fixed exercise date .",
    "the extension to american options seems to be more involved .",
    "the starting point of this work is the _ martingale option price_. as was shown in early eighties , the black - scholes ( b - s ) option price can also be obtained using martingale methods @xcite .",
    "this is a shorter , although more abstract way , to derive an expression for the call price .",
    "the main advantage is that one only needs to know the probability density function governing market evolution .",
    "the main inconvenience is that there is no known hedging strategy as in the case of b - s theory .",
    "the probability distribution of some of the more realistic market models we will use is only known through its characteristic function .",
    "we will therefore derive a formula which will allow us to obtain , via martingale price , the option price in terms of the characteristic function of the market model chosen .",
    "having the necessary tools to address the problem , we will apply them to a recently presented market model which shows self - similarity , fat tails and finite moments @xcite .",
    "we will obtain an option price this model and compare it with b - s price .",
    "the second problem we want to address is the effect of colored noise in the price of options .",
    "the gbm model supposes that prices are driven by gaussian white noise , this implies that prices @xmath1 , at different times , are uncorrelated which , for certain times scales , does not seem to be completely adjusted to reality .",
    "we will thus assume that prices are driven by colored noise and obtain the corresponding fair price for the european call .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , after this introduction , in sect .",

    "[ cor ] we study the effect of colored noise on option pricing .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "we start by recalling that an european call option is a derivative giving to its owner the right but not the obligation to buy a share at a fixed date @xmath15 ( the maturity ) for a certain price @xmath16 ( the strike or striking price ) .",
    "the call option contract is basically specified by its gain at maturity . if @xmath17 is the share price at time @xmath15 this gain , called payoff , is given by @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{payoff}\\ ] ]    as was shown in the early eighties @xcite , the b - s option price can also be obtained using martingale methods .",
    "this is a shorter , although more abstract way , to derive an expression for the call price .",
    "the main advantage being that one only needs to know the probability density function governing market evolution .    before proceeding",
    "further let us briefly explain , in layman terms and without pretending to be rigorous , what a martingale is .",
    "suppose @xmath19 is a well defined random process such that its previous history is perfectly known .",
    "that is , we keep record , and hence know of , all values taken by @xmath19 before time @xmath2 . under these conditions",
    "the process is a martingale if the conditional expected value @xmath20 for any @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 an example . under quite general conditions",
    "any driftless process driven by zero - mean noise is a martingale @xcite .",
    "if @xmath19 follows the sde : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a zero - mean random process , then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is known and @xmath24 is supposed to be integrable , at least in the sense of generalized functions . since @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 .",
    "hence @xmath19 is a martingale .    in what follows",
    "we generalize the gbm model ( [ gbm])([gbmrsol ] ) to include driving noises other than the wiener process and thus trying to account for some features of real markets such as fat tails , self - scaling and , eventually , correlations .",
    "we therefore proposed as market model the one whose return is given by ( see eq .",
    "( [ gbmrsol ] ) ) @xmath29 where @xmath9 is the ( constant ) mean return rate , @xmath24 is zero - mean noise and , if needed , the integral of @xmath24 should be interpreted in the sense of it .",
    "we define the _ zero - mean return _ @xmath19 by @xmath30 in generalizing the gbm for option pricing we have to assume that the zero - mean return @xmath19 does not allow for arbitrage opportunities . in other words , it must avoid money profits for free without taking any risk . to this end , as was proved by harrison _",
    "@xcite , it suffices that @xmath19 be a noise of unbounded variation .",
    "we will assume this condition in what follows .",
    "one can easily show from eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) that @xmath31 for any @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the zero - mean return is a martingale .",
    "moreover , in terms of @xmath19 the return is @xmath33 in consequence , @xmath34 obeys the following sde @xmath35 which is the generalization of sde ( [ gbmr ] ) .",
    "we now return to options .",
    "the equivalent martingale measure theory imposes the condition that , in a  risk - neutral world \" , the stock price @xmath1 evolves , on average , as a riskless security and discards any underlying process that allows for arbitrage opportunities .",
    "thus if at time @xmath2 we buy a european call on stock having price @xmath36 , then in terms of the risk - neutral density @xmath37 it is possible to express the price for the european call option by defining its value as the discounted expected gain due to holding the call .",
    "that is @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the maturity and strike of the option .",
    "let us define the risk - neutral density @xmath37 .",
    "this density , which is also called the `` equivalent martingale measure '' associated with return @xmath34 under `` risk - neutrality '' , is the probability density function ( pdf ) of a process @xmath39 which we call _ risk - neutral return _ and such that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the risk - free interest rate ratio . since the stock price associated with @xmath42",
    "is given by @xmath43 , condition ( [ risknuetralcond ] ) imposes that risk - neutral prices @xmath44 must grow on average as a riskless security .",
    "note that we can easily prove that stock price @xmath36 is always greater than call price . in effect , from ( [ call1 ] ) we have @xmath45 and , after using eq .",
    "( [ risknuetralcond ] ) we conclude that @xmath46 we now assume that the market model for the evolution of the underlying stock is given by eq .",
    "( [ newmodeldif ] ) .",
    "then , analogously to eq .",
    "( [ newmodel ] ) for the return @xmath34 , we impose that the risk - neutral return @xmath39 be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a deterministic function and @xmath19 is given by eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) . in order to find",
    "the expression for @xmath48 , observe that @xmath49 and from the risk neutrality condition ( [ risknuetralcond ] ) we see that @xmath50 the average @xmath51 is obtained from the known probability distribution of the driving noise @xmath19 . indeed , let @xmath52 be the characteristic function of @xmath19 , @xmath53 then @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the gbm , the zero - mean return @xmath19 is the wiener process ( _ cf . _",
    "( [ gbmr ] ) ) .",
    "thus @xmath56 consequently @xmath57 is the spurious drift , and @xmath58    finally , since @xmath39 and @xmath19 are related by the simple linear relation ( [ riskneutralr ] ) , the risk - neutral density @xmath59 can be written , in terms of the zero - mean return density @xmath60 , as @xmath61 and the price of the call is given by @xmath62",
    "as we have said , the main advantage of martingale pricing is that one can obtain a fair option price when the market obeys a random dynamics different than the geometric brownian motion . in this case",
    "one only has to know the return distribution of the underlying and then , using eq .",
    "( [ call2 ] ) , one readily gets a fair price for the option .",
    "nevertheless , knowing an analytical expression of the pdf @xmath63 may be , in practice , beyond our reach .",
    "there are however many situations in which we know the characteristic function of the model although one is not able to invert the fourier transform and obtain the density @xmath63 .",

    ", we will develop an option pricing based on a combination of martingale methods and harmonic analysis .",
    "we recall that the characteristic function ( cf ) of a random variable is the fourier transform of its probability density function .",
    "thus the characteristic function of the return will be given by : @xmath64 the starting point of our analysis is eq .",

    "this would be indeed the case of more sophisticated market models such as those of next sections .",
    "a similar result has been given in @xcite using a different but equivalent form of eq .",
    "( [ charcall2 ] ) in order to numerically perform the integration knowing @xmath75 .",
    "it is asserted in @xcite that these fourier methods allow a fast computing of the option price .",
    "we close this section presenting an alternative price formula to that of eq .",
    "( [ charcall2 ] ) that is written in terms of the characteristic function of the zero - mean return instead of the risk - neutral cf @xmath74 .",
    "this price formula only involves real quantities and it can be more convenient in a number of cases . from eq .",
    "( [ relationpdfs ] ) we easily see that @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the characteristic function of the zero - mean return @xmath19 .",

    "we want to elucidate what this implies on the price of the option .",
    "the first market model incorporating heavy tails in a natural way was given by mandelbroth in the early sixties @xcite who , based on pareto - lvy stable laws , obtained a leptokurtic distribution .",
    "in that model , the zero - mean return defined above has the following characteristic function @xmath93 @xmath94 .",
    "there is , however , a drawback in this model : no finite moments exist beyond the first one .",
    "this certainly is a severe limitation specially for the practitioner .",
    "moreover , testing the pareto - lvy distribution against data has always resulted with the same conclusion : the tails are far too heavy compared with actual data .",
    "although , as mantegna and stanley have clearly shown @xcite , the lvy distribution fits very well the center of empirical distributions  much better than the gaussian distribution of the gbm .",
    "furthermore , lvy distributions show a feature recently observed in data , specially in intraday data , and this is the self - scaling behavior of the probability distribution at different times  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , and regardless these advantages , the absence of finite moments seriously affects obtaining a price for options .",
    "indeed , in this case the average @xmath51 does not exist ( see eqs .",
    "( [ expx])([m * ] ) ) and option price  ( [ call2 ] ) is useless . therefore , any attempt to price options through lvy processes has to be done by means of truncated lvy distributions @xcite with the added inconvenience that truncation is an _",
    "ad hoc _ procedure introducing high degrees of arbitrariness .    in a recent work we have presented a market model that explains the appearance of fat tails and self - scaling but still keeping all moments finite @xcite . in that model",
    "we assume that all random changes in the stock price are modelled by a continuos superposition of different shot - noise sources , each source corresponding to the detailed arrival of information @xcite .",
    "the zero - mean return is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the maximum  number \" of noise sources taken up to time @xmath2 and it is an increasing function of time to be determined by the self - scaling property ( see below ) . for any fixed time @xmath2 , @xmath97 are independent random variables for different values of parameter @xmath98 and for any fixed value of @xmath2 , @xmath97 is a white shot - noise process represented by a countable superposition of poisson pulses of rectangular shape : @xmath99 , \\label{y}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the heaviside step function , @xmath101 marks the onset of the @xmath102th pulse , and @xmath103 is its amplitude .",

    "third , kurtosis is constant and given by @xmath125 thus @xmath126 for all @xmath2 , in other words , we have a leptokurtic distribution ( _ i.e. , _ heavy tails ) in all time scales .",
    "fourth , the return probability distribution scales as @xmath127 and the model becomes self - similar  @xcite .    as to the asymptotic behavior of our distribution .",
    "it can be shown from eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) that the center of the distribution , defined by @xmath128 , is again approximated by the lvy distribution defined above . on the other hand the tails of the distribution",

    "as we have mentioned in section 1 , the classical option formula of black , scholes and merton is based on the  efficient market hypothesis \" which means that the market incorporates instantaneously any information concerning future market evolution @xcite",
    ". however , as empirical evidence shows , real markets are not efficient , at least at short times @xcite .",
    "indeed , market efficiency is closely related to the assumption of totally uncorrelated price variations ( white noise ) .",
    "but white noise is only an idealization since , in practice , no actual random process is completely white . for this reason , white processes are convenient mathematical objects valid only when the observation time is much larger than the auto correlation time of the process . and , analogously , the efficient market hypothesis is again a convenient assumption when the observation time is much larger than time spans in which `` inefficiencies '' ( _ i.e. _ , correlations , delays , etc . ) occur .",
    "note that auto correlation in the underlying driving noise is closely related to the predictability of asset returns , of which there seems to be ample evidence @xcite .",
    "indeed , if for some particular stock the price variations are correlated during some time @xmath162 , then the price at time @xmath163 will be related to the price at a previous time @xmath164 as long as the time span @xmath165 is not too long compared to the correlation time @xmath162 .",

    "more precisely , @xmath168 is o - u noise in the stationary regime , which is a gaussian colored noise with zero mean and correlation function : @xmath172 note that , when @xmath167 , this correlation goes to @xmath173 and we thus recover the one - dimensional diffusion discussed above .",
    "therefore , the case of positive @xmath162 is a measure of the inefficiencies of the market . the combination of eqs .",

    "when @xmath175 , eq .",
    "( [ ouv ] ) shows that @xmath176 .",
    "thus , @xmath168 is constant which we may equal it to zero .",
    "hence , @xmath177 and the underlying price , @xmath178 , evolves as a riskless security .",
    "we also observe that the o - u process @xmath168 is the random part of the return velocity , and sometimes we refer to @xmath168 as the `` velocity '' of the return process @xmath34 .",
    "one may argue that the o - u process  ( [ our])([ouv ] ) is an inadequate asset model since the return @xmath34 given by eq .",
    "( [ our ] ) is a continuous random process with bounded variations .",
    "as we have explained in section 2 , continuous processes with bounded variations allow arbitrage opportunities and this is an undesirable feature for obtaining a fair price .",
    "thus , for instance , in this present case arbitrage would be possible within a portfolio containing bonds and stock whose strategy at time @xmath2 is buying ( or selling ) stock shares when @xmath179 is greater ( or lower ) than the risk - free bond rate  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem is that in the practice the return velocity @xmath168 is non tradable and its evolution is ignored .",
    "in other words , in real markets the observed asset dynamics does not show any trace of the velocity variable .",
    "indeed , knowing @xmath168 would imply knowing the value of the return @xmath34 at two different times , since @xmath180 obviously , this operation is not performed by traders who only manage portfolios at time @xmath2 based on prices at @xmath2 and not at any earlier time .",
    "this feature allows us to perform a projection of the two - dimensional diffusion process @xmath181 $ ] onto a one - dimensional equivalent process @xmath182 independent of the velocity @xmath168 .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite the projected process @xmath182 is equal to the actual return @xmath34 in mean square sense , @xmath183 ^ 2\\rangle=0 $ ] for any time @xmath2 , and it obeys the following one - dimensional sde and @xmath182 are equal in mean square sense we will drop the bar on @xmath184 as long as there is no confusion .",
    "thus , we will use @xmath185 for the projected process as well . ]",
    "@xmath186 where @xmath187 in this way , we have projected the two - dimensional o - u process @xmath188 onto a one - dimensional price process which is a wiener process with time varying volatility .",
    "therefore , the return given by eq .",
    "( [ sde ] ) is driven by a noise of unbounded variation , the wiener process , and the o - u projected process is still a suitable starting point for option pricing since it does not permit arbitrage .",
    "we also note that we need to specify the final condition of the process because the volatility @xmath189 is a function of the time to maturity @xmath156 , and this implies that the projected asset model depends on each particular contract .",
    "the zero - mean return ( [ x ] ) associated with the projected process ( [ sde ] ) follows the sde @xmath190 and its density , @xmath79 , satisfies the backward equation @xmath191 with final condition @xmath192 .",

    "( [ call4 ] ) reduces to the black - scholes price given by eq .",
    "( [ bsprice ] ) .",
    "we observe that the o - u price in eq .",

    "[ calls - correlated ] , we plot @xmath209 in terms of @xmath153 for three different values of the time to maturity .",
    "we see in the figure that , analogously to b - s and heavy tail cases , the o - u price increases with maturity . in any case",
    ", _ the assumption of uncorrelated underlying assets ( b - s case ) overprices any call option_. this confirms the intuition understanding that correlation implies more predictability and therefore less risk and , finally , a lower price for the option .",
    "in fact , one can quantify this overprice by evaluating the relative difference @xmath210 figure  [ corr - diff ] shows the ratio @xmath211 , for a fixed time to expiration , plotted as a function of the moneyness , @xmath153 .",
    "note that the relative difference @xmath212 increases as @xmath156 decreases .",
    "moreover , contrary to the fat tail case , @xmath212 quickly fades away with moneyness and it is negligible for itm options showing no crossover .",
    "we have performed an analytical study of option pricing on a more realistic setting than that of black and scholes theory .",
    "our starting point has been the martingale option price conveniently modified to become more practical to implement by means of fourier analysis .",
    "we have applied these analytical tools to study the effect on option price of long tails in the underlying probability distribution . for this , we have used a market model we recently developed @xcite which combines fat tails , finite moments and self - similarity . the second problem we wanted to address is the effect of colored noise on option pricing , since there seems to be empirical evidence of mild auto correlation in stocks @xcite .",
    "we have thus rederived , using the methods herein presented , our previous result on option pricing on stocks driven by o - u noise .",
    "one overall conclusion is that , taking the black - scholes price as a benchmark , heavy tails overprice by far options , while colored driving noise underprices it .",
    "the scheme is @xmath213 where @xmath36 is the underlying price when the option is bought and @xmath214 is the deterministic price given by eq .",
    "( [ calldeter ] ) .",
    "moreover , the relative difference with b - s price is in both cases more important for otm and atm options than for itm options . in any case",
    ", there is a great persistence of fat - tail effects on the price of the options .",
    "there are some open questions , one of which being the extension of the above formalism to other option classes ( american , asian , etc . ) .",
    "another point is to investigate whether fat tails and correlations produce the  smile effect \" in the implied volatility .",
    "we believe that this is more likely to happen in the case of heavy - tails .",
    "this point is under present investigation .",
