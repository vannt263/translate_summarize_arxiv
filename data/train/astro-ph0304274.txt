    "central massive black holes ( @xmath0s ) are now thought to reside in virtually all galaxies with a hot spheroidal stellar component ( hereafter bulge ) .",
    "such @xmath0s seem to be a relic of past quasar activity ( e.g.,@xcite ) and related to host galaxy properties , with the implication that @xmath0and galaxy formation processes are closely linked .",
    "previous work has shown that @xmath0  mass @xmath2  is correlated with both blue luminosity @xmath10  and bulge mass @xmath11 , although with considerable intrinsic scatter ( @xmath12 in log@xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath2  and the bulge effective stellar velocity dispersion @xmath3   correlate more tightly ( @xmath13 ) than @xmath2-@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the smaller scatter of the @xmath2-@xmath3  correlation suggests that the bulge dynamics ( or mass ) , rather than luminosity , is the agent of the correlation . but the smaller spread relative to @xmath2-@xmath1  appears to be an artefact of the manipulations necessary to derive @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , recent work has shown that when bulge parameters are measured with more accuracy [ e.g. profile fitting rather than average correction for disk light @xcite ] , the resulting scatter is comparable to that of @xmath2-@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the correlation between @xmath2  and bulge light concentration also has a comparably low scatter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are strong indications that @xmath10  of the brightest elliptical galaxies , for which decomposition issues are unimportant , deviate significantly from the @xmath2-@xmath1  relation @xcite .",
    "hence , longer wavelengths may also be necessary to better define the intrinsic scatter in @xmath2-@xmath1  compared to that of @xmath2-@xmath3 .    in this paper , we reexamine the @xmath2-@xmath1  correlation by accurately measuring the bulge luminosity in the near - infrared ( nir ) for all galaxies with a well - determined @xmath2 .",
    "all previous studies have used optical light ( b or r ) to test the @xmath2-@xmath1  relation , but nir light provides a clear advantage over the optical : it is a better tracer of stellar mass and less subject to the effects of extinction .",
    "if the physical correlation is between the @xmath0  mass and bulge mass , the nir correlations @xmath2-@xmath1  should be tighter than those in the optical , because of the smaller variation of @xmath14 ratio @xmath15  with mass ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . moreover , we use a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bulge / disk decomposition to determine bulge parameters , an improvement on earlier work which applied 1d fits only . here",
    "we construct the largest possible sample , by considering all galaxies which have been used for the @xmath2-@xmath3  and @xmath2-@xmath10  correlations . in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] we present the sample of galaxies with direct dynamical @xmath0  mass measurements , and in  [ sec : analysis ] describe the images and the 2d bulge / disk decomposition applied to them .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : results ] we discuss the results of the analysis .",
    "to date , there are 37 galaxies with direct gas kinematical or stellar dynamical determination of the central @xmath0  mass .",
    "these galaxies have been compiled and made into a uniform sample ( e.g. ,  for distances ) by a number of authors ( e.g.,@xcite ; hereafter mf02 and t02 , respectively ) .",
    "we adopt the data from the recent paper by t02 with some modifications and additions .",
    "the data in columns 1 - 5 and 9 of table 1 are from the compilation by t02 and the reader can refer to that paper for more details . differently from t02 , when galaxy distances from surface brightness fluctuations ( @xcite ) are not available , we use recession velocities corrected for virgocentric infall from the leda database ( http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/ ) with @xmath16 . in a few cases ,",
    "we also consider @xmath0  mass estimates from different papers than those used by t02 ; thus , in col .  6 , we indicate the appropriate references . with respect to the 31 galaxies considered by t02 we add : cygnus a @xcite , m81 @xcite , m84 @xcite , ngc 4594 @xcite , centaurus a @xcite and ngc 5252 @xcite .",
    "following mf02 , we divide the galaxies into two groups . in the first group ,",
    "we place all the galaxies which have a secure @xmath0  mass measurement and an accurate determination of the bulge nir luminosity .",
    "we consider ` secure ' those @xmath0  masses for which the black hole sphere of influence , @xmath17 ( column 7 of table 1 ) , has been clearly resolved , i.e. ,  @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the spatial resolution of the observations . additional reasons for placing galaxies in group 2 are given in table 1 .",
    "we have constructed a homogeneous set of nir images of the galaxies presented in table 1 ( except for the milky way and m31 ) by retrieving j , h , and k atlas images from the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass ) .",
    "when a single atlas image contained only a portion of the galaxy , we also retrieved adjacent tiles and mosaicked the images after subtracting the sky background and rescaling for the different zero points .",
    "the 2mass images are photometrically calibrated with a typical accuracy of a few percent .",
    "more details can be found in hunt & marconi ( 2003 ; hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "we performed a 2d bulge / disk decomposition of the images using the program galfit @xcite which is made publicly available by the authors .",
    "this code allows the fitting of several components with different functional shapes ( e.g. , generalized exponential ( sersic ) and simple exponential laws ) ; the best fit parameters are determined by minimizing @xmath20 .",
    "more details on galfit can be found in @xcite .",
    "we fit separately the j , h and k images .",
    "each fit was started by fitting a single sersic component and constant background . when necessary ( e.g. ,  for spiral galaxies ) , an additional component ( usually an exponential disk ) was added . in many cases",
    "these initial fits left large residuals and we thus increased the number of components ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the fits are described in detail in paper  ii . in table 1",
    "we present the j , h and k bulge magnitudes , effective bulge radii @xmath6 in the j band , and their uncertainties .",
    "the j , h and k magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction using the data by @xcite .",
    "we used the j band to determine @xmath6 because the images tend to be flatter , and thus the background is better determined .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : corr ] we plot , from left to right , @xmath2  vs @xmath21 , @xmath2  vs @xmath11 , and the residuals of @xmath2-@xmath3  vs @xmath6 ( based on the fit from t02 ) . only group",
    "1 galaxies are shown .",
    "@xmath11  is the virial bulge mass given by @xmath22 ; if bulges behave as isothermal spheres , @xmath23 .",
    "however , comparing our virial estimates @xmath11  with those @xmath24 , obtained from dynamical modeling @xcite , shows that @xmath11  and @xmath24  are well correlated ( @xmath25 ) ; setting @xmath26 ( rather than @xmath27 ) gives an average ratio of unity .",
    "therefore , we have used @xmath26 in the above formula . considering the uncertainties of both mass estimates , the scatter of the ratio @xmath11/@xmath24  is 0.21 dex .",
    "we fit the data with the bisector linear regression from @xcite which allows for uncertainties on both variables and intrinsic dispersion .",
    "the fitexy routine @xcite used by t02 gives consistent results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ) .",
    "fit results of @xmath2  vs galaxy properties for group 1 and the combined samples are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of the residuals ( @xmath4 ) has been estimated with a maximum likelihood method assuming normally - distributed values .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] and table 2 show that @xmath21and @xmath11  correlate well with the @xmath0  mass .",
    "the correlation between @xmath2and @xmath11  is equivalent to that between the radius of the @xmath0  sphere of influence @xmath28  ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath6 .      to compare the scatter of @xmath2-@xmath1  for different wavebands , we have also analyzed the b - band bulge luminosities for our sample .",
    "the upper limit of the intrinsic dispersion of the @xmath2-@xmath1  correlations goes from @xmath30 dex in @xmath31 when considering all galaxies , to @xmath32 when considering only those of group 1 .",
    "hence , for galaxies with reliable @xmath2  and @xmath1 , the scatter of @xmath2-@xmath1  correlations is @xmath32 , _ independently of the spectral band used ( b or jhk ) _ , comparable to that of @xmath2-@xmath3",
    ". this scatter would be smaller if measurement errors are underestimated . @xcite and @xcite reached a similar conclusion using r - band @xmath1  but on smaller samples . the correlation between r - band bulge light concentration and @xmath2has a comparable scatter @xcite .",
    "since @xmath2-@xmath10  and @xmath2-@xmath33  have comparable dispersions , the rough bulge / disk decomposition (  [ sec : intro ] ) , the larger reddening and stellar population effects do not apparently compromise the correlation .",
    "most of the galaxies in the sample are early types , and thus may be less sensitive to the above effects .",
    "however , the scatter in the @xmath2-@xmath1correlations does not decrease significantly when considering only elliptical galaxies .",
    "the correlation between @xmath2  and @xmath11  has a slightly lower dispersion ( 0.25 versus 0.3 ) than @xmath2-@xmath1 . if the scatter of @xmath11-@xmath24  ( 0.21 dex ) is an indication of the additional uncertainties on our virial estimates , then the intrinsic scatter of @xmath2-@xmath11  drops to @xmath34 dex .",
    "judging from the present data where only secure @xmath2  and @xmath1  are included , @xmath3 , @xmath11 , @xmath10  and @xmath33  provide equally good @xmath2  estimates to within a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "all the slopes are roughly unity , but those of @xmath2-@xmath1  are systematically larger than that of @xmath2-@xmath11 .",
    "this is expected if @xmath1  correlates with @xmath2  because of its dependence on @xmath11   through the stellar @xmath14 ratio . from our @xmath11-@xmath1  relation",
    ", we find that @xmath36 ; the weak dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath38 fully accounts for the different slopes of @xmath2-@xmath21  and @xmath2-@xmath11 , and the same applies to the j and h bands .",
    "all correlations are thus consistent with a direct proportionality between @xmath2  and bulge mass .",
    "this contrasts with previous claims of a non - linearity of the @xmath2-@xmath11  relation @xcite but is in agreement with @xcite . a partial correlation analysis of log@xmath2  ( variable @xmath39 ) , log@xmath3  ( @xmath40 ) , and log@xmath6 ( @xmath41 ) shows that @xmath2  is _ separately _ significantly correlated both with @xmath3  and @xmath6 .",
    "the pearson partial correlation coefficients , in which the known dependence of @xmath3  and @xmath6 is eliminated , are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with a significance of @xmath44 .",
    "this is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr]c , where the residuals of the t02 @xmath2-@xmath3  correlation are plotted against @xmath6 ; there is a weak , but significant , correlation of these residuals with @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , when galaxy structural parameters are measured carefully from 2d image analysis , the additional , weaker , dependence of @xmath2  on @xmath6 is uncovered .",
    "thus , a combination of both @xmath3  and @xmath6 is necessary to drive the correlations between @xmath2  and other bulge properties .",
    "this _ fundamental plane _ of black holes will be further investigated elsewhere .",
    "the average @xmath45 can be estimated assuming a log - normal distribution with normally distributed observational errors . with maximum likelihood",
    "we find @xmath46 with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.27 dex ( -2.79 and 0.49 dex for all galaxies ) .",
    "adopting the method of @xcite , we find @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( -2.86 and 0.44 for all galaxies ) consistently with their result of -2.9 and 0.45 dex ( see also @xcite ) .",
