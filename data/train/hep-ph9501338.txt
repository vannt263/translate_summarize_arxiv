    "it has been known for a long time that the short distance strong interactions may be described by qcd in perturbation theory , and that the _ leading _ , short distance nonperturbative effects can be incorporated by taking into account the nonzero values of quark and gluon condensates in the physical vacuum , @xmath5 : @xmath6 from the pioneering svz work on qcd sum rules  @xcite , we know that @xmath7 a value confirmed by subsequent analyses . these methods are applicable to study bound states of heavy quarks , as shown in the papers of leutwyler  @xcite and voloshin  @xcite and , more recently , in our work  @xcite where we have demonstrated that , indeed , a consistent description of @xmath8 @xmath1 states and @xmath9 @xmath3 ones ( @xmath10 being the principal quantum number ) is obtained if one includes perturbative corrections in the form of radiative corrections to the coulombic , short distance qcd potential , @xmath11 as well as nonperturbative ones through the contributions of @xmath4 ( the quark condensate contributes a negligible amount ) . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite we found the following values for the fine and hyperfine splittings in bottomium , with @xmath12 , @xmath13 the total spin , and @xmath14 the total angular momentum : @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 may be compared to the experimental figures @xmath18 in eqs .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) and ( [ hyperf ] ) the first error is due to that in the qcd parameter @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the the second to that of @xmath4 as given by eq .",
    "( [ gluoncond ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the prediction of @xmath21 for @xmath3 suggests a value _ opposite _ in sign to that of @xmath22 ( where experimentally , @xmath23 ) .",
    "this change of sign is due to the structure of the qcd vacuum through the contribution of the gluon condensate .",
    "in fact , and as we will show below , any calculation neglecting this would give a _ negative _ @xmath21 , of the order of @xmath24 to @xmath25 mev .",
    "thus , a measurement of @xmath21 can be directly interpreted as a measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "the results reported above , eqs .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) and ( [ hyperf ] ) are less impressive than what the agreement with experiment would lead one to believe .",
    "the reason is that they contain radiative and nonperturbative contributions which are of relative order unity , thus impairing the reliability of the calculation . in this note , however , we show that by _ combining _ the fine ( eq .  ( [ deltas ] ) ) and hyperfine ( eq .  ( [ hyperf ] ) )",
    "splittings one can get a clean prediction for the last , in which both radiative and nonperturbative effects are small and fully under control .",
    "as shown by several people ( cf .",
    "refs  @xcite for details and references ) the leading perturbative , radiative and nonperturbative interactions that contribute to the fine and hyperfine splittings are the ls , t ( tensor ) and hf ( hyperfine ) potentials , @xmath26 \\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi } \\right\\ } \\\\ \\nonumber & \\equiv & v_{\\rm ls}^{(0 ) } + v_{\\rm ls}^{({\\rm rad } ) } \\;,\\ ; v_{\\rm ls}^{(0 ) } = \\frac{3 c_f \\alpha_s(\\mu^2)}{2 m^2 r^3 }   \\,\\vec l \\cdot \\vec s   \\ ; , \\\\ v_{\\rm t}(\\vec r ) & = & \\frac{c_f \\alpha_s(\\mu^2)}{4 m^2 r^3 } \\label{eq : ht } \\ , \\left\\ {   1 + \\left [   d + \\frac{\\beta_0}{2 } \\ln r \\mu - 3\\ln m r \\right ]    \\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi }   \\right\\ } \\\\ \\nonumber & \\equiv & v_{\\rm t}^{(0 ) } + v_{\\rm t}^{({\\rm rad } ) } \\;,\\ ; v_{\\rm t}^{(0 ) } = \\frac{c_f \\alpha_s(\\mu^2)}{4 m^2 r^3 } \\ ; , \\\\ \\label{eq : hhf } v_{\\rm hf}(\\vec r ) & = & \\left(\\frac{\\beta_0}{2}-\\frac{21}{4}\\right)\\ , \\frac{c_f \\alpha_s(\\mu^2)}{3 m^2\\,r^3 } \\,{\\vec s}^2 \\;;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 @xmath28 has an extra piece proportional to @xmath29 which however does not contribute to the states with @xmath0 in which we are interested .",
    "a spin independent radiative correction which also intervenes indirectly is given by @xmath30 the nonperturbative interactions are generated by a term @xmath31 the constant chromoelectric @xmath32 and chromomagnetic @xmath33 fields are to be taken as matrices in color space , and the vacuum is to be assumed such that @xmath34 ( @xmath35 colour indices , @xmath36 spatial ones ) .    the key point in the present paper is the remark that the radial operator that appears in all three @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath28 is the same one at leading order , viz .",
    ", @xmath39 ; and it so happens that the _ largest _ perturbative and nonperturbative corrections are those to the _ wave functions _ which are the same for all fine and hyperfine splittings .",
    "this allows us to factor these out , being left with _",
    "small _ and manageable pieces .",
    "consider for example the fine splittings . because the radiative pieces of @xmath37 , @xmath38 are to be taken in perturbation theory , and the same is true of the nonperturbative interactions given in eq .",
    "( [ nonp ] ) , we find , e.g. , @xmath40 the @xmath41 are the wave functions for the states with @xmath42 , @xmath0 , @xmath43 and total angular momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the contributions to @xmath16 may be split into two pieces .",
    "first we have what we may call _ `` external '' _ , @xmath44 , obtained by substituting in eq .",
    "( [ expr ] ) the unperturbed wave functions solutions to @xmath45 where the potential in @xmath46 is just the coulombic one .",
    "it so happens that both _ radiative _ and _ nonperturbative _ contributions to @xmath44 are _ small _ , at the 10% level or smaller .",
    "the troublesome piece is what we may call _ `` internal '' _ , @xmath47 , and is due to the fact that @xmath41 also contains spin  independent radiative and nonperturbative corrections : @xmath48 then , @xmath47 would be the contribution of @xmath49 , @xmath50 to eq .",
    "( [ expr ] ) ( the radiative corrections are caused by the spin ",
    "independent corrections to the potential , and the non perturbative ones by the spin ",
    "independent pieces generated by eq .",
    "( [ nonp ] ) , i.e , the contribution quadratic in @xmath51 ) . as stated before , however , the key point is that , when evaluating @xmath47 , and because @xmath49 and @xmath50 are already perturbations , only the leading pieces of the potentials i.e. , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath28 have to be considered , and these are all proportional to @xmath39 , hence identical for fine and hyperfine splittings .    for a precise evaluation",
    "we take the explicit formulas of ref .",
    "then one finds the following theoretical values for the splittings : @xmath54 \\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi } \\",
    "\\\\ \\label{theo } \\delta_{\\rm np } & = & \\frac{2244}{3315 } \\ , \\frac{\\pi \\langle \\alpha_s g^2 \\rangle}{m^3 ( c_f \\widetilde{\\alpha}_s)^2 } \\ , , \\\\ \\nonumber \\widetilde{\\alpha}_s & = & \\left [ 1 + \\frac{\\gamma_{\\rm e } \\beta_0/2 + ( 93- 10 n_f)/36}{\\pi } \\alpha_s \\right ] \\,\\alpha_s \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as for the hyperfine splitting @xmath55 the nonperturbative piece of eq .",
    "( [ theohf ] ) is due to the term @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ nonp ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the best overall fit to @xmath42 states was obtained for @xmath57 ( this corresponds to @xmath58=0.93 gev ) . in this paper",
    "we will allow @xmath59 to vary between 0.33 and 0.43 which corresponds to the range @xmath60 gev , the expected `` relevant '' scale , @xmath61 .",
    "in all this range @xmath62 , and @xmath63 : we check that both radiative and nonperturbative corrections to the fine splittings , eq .",
    "( [ theo ] ) , are small .",
    "agreement with experiment is excellent in all the range .",
    "this is shown is fig .  1 where we plot the values of @xmath64 , @xmath65 that follow from eq .",
    "( [ theo ] ) by treating , in eq .",
    "( [ theo ] ) , @xmath64 as a free parameter , then fitting @xmath64 , @xmath65 to experiment .",
    "for all the range , agreement between the theoretical values @xmath66 and experimental ones ( cf .",
    "( [ expt ] ) ) is better than 10% with respect to central experimental values , and agreement within experimental errors is even obtained for @xmath67 .",
    "allowing @xmath68 , and the range of eq .",
    "( [ gluoncond ] ) for @xmath69 , eqs .",
    "( [ theo ] ) and ( [ theohf ] ) yield a very reliable prediction for the hyperfine splitting ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : @xmath70 ( the first error is due to the variation of @xmath71 , and the second to the error in @xmath4 ) .    a few words should be said on this . as eq .",
    "( [ theohf ] ) shows , @xmath21 is the sum of two terms , a perturbative and a nonperturbative one . that the second one dominates is due to the fact that the perturbative contribution itself is the _ difference _ between two pieces , proportional respectively to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , each one large , but which cancel almost exactly : for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , while @xmath76 .",
    "and the whole perturbative term is still smaller because the _ tree level _ potential is proportional to @xmath29 , hence gives zero for @xmath0 states .",
    "thus an effect potentially @xmath77 is actually of order @xmath78 .",
    "this is very much suppressed and thus highlights by contrast the nonperturbative contribution .",
    "a remarkable feature of the splitting ( [ predhf ] ) is that it _ can not _",
    "be reproduced by the use of any of the phenomenological potentials available on the market .",
    "indeed , _ any _ model that neglects the nonzero expectation value of @xmath79 in the qcd vacuum will _ necessarily _ yield a _ negative _ @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , if one pretends to simulate nonperturbative effects by use of spin  independent potentials , then one has eqs .",
    "( [ theo ] ) and ( [ theohf ] ) replaced by : @xmath80 a simple calculation , also for the range @xmath68 gives good agreement for @xmath81 , @xmath82 with experiment , but now @xmath83 the gap between eq .",
    "( [ pothf ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ predhf ] ) is sufficiently large that a measurement , probably feasible with b  factories , should be able to reveal it .    as a last comment ,",
    "let us remind the reader that the analysis we have carried is justified only at short distances . for @xmath3 with @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath86 the situation is even more favourable , but the measurement is of course impossible . for @xmath1 we can not carry a rigourous analysis since we have @xmath87 . however",
    "we may attempt a phenomenological calculation which mimicks the theoretical one done just before ; using eq .",
    "( [ theo ] ) with the appropriate changes , i.e @xmath88 , @xmath89 and replacing @xmath90 , we get perfect agreement with the experimental fine splittings for @xmath91 .",
    "the external nonperturbative term is reasonably small and , although @xmath92 is large , one can still interpret it as an _ effective _ coupling into which are lumped internal corrections and higher order perturbative ones . using then the appropriate modification of eq .",
    "( [ theohf ] ) @xmath93 we get @xmath94 ( the error being that in @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that the experimental value @xmath95 falls within the range of the previous prediction .",
    "another noteworthy feature is the role played by the gluon condensate in obtaining ( [ theohfc ] ) .",
    "if we had set @xmath96 we would have obtained @xmath97 widely off experiment . with experiment",
    "is obtained at the cost of using _ different _ values of @xmath71 for fine and hyperfine splittings , or extra phenomenological ls or t interactions , or both ; see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and work quoted there .",
    "] this strongly suggests that the system of eqs .",
    "( [ theo ] ) and ( [ theohf ] ) which as we have just seen works reasonably well even for @xmath1 bound states , can be trusted to provide a reliable description of the @xmath42 , @xmath0 fine and hyperfine splittings of bottomium .",
