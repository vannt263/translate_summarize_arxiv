    "conventional cosmology is based upon a four dimensional spacetime whose evolution is governed by the einstein field equations .",
    "this picture certainly breaks down at the planck scale due to quantum corrections to the gravitational action .",
    "furthermore , stringy effects may change our understanding of spacetime at energies one or two orders of magnitude below the planck scale .",
    "unfortunately , both the planck and string energy scales are entirely inaccessible to direct experimentation .",
    "however , thanks to the dramatic expansion of the universe during the inflationary era , it is possible that cosmology provides an unexpected window into physics at the shortest _ length _ scales @xcite-@xcite .",
    "if we assume the universe has always been matter dominated and is now around 13 billion years old , the current horizon size is roughly 40 billion lightyears , or @xmath7 planck lengths . if inflation ended at the gut scale ( @xmath8gev ) with efficient reheating , the universe has grown roughly @xmath9 times larger since reheating , and by at least a similar amount during inflation , in order to ensure that the universe is homogeneous on scales equal to the present horizon size .",
    "consequently , all distances significantly smaller than galactic scales in the current universe were necessarily sub - planckian at some point during inflation .",
    "if the inflationary period continues for longer than the minimum time necessary to solve the cosmological flatness and horizon problems , all presently visible scales must have crossed the planckian boundary during inflation .",
    "conversely , without inflation all astrophysical scales are mapped to lengths larger than the planck length at all times since the age of the universe was of order the planck time .    on the face of it ,",
    "the fact that astrophysical scales in the present universe correspond to sub - planckian scales during the inflationary epoch is simply a mathematical curiosity .",
    "however , inflation generates perturbations through the exponential stretching of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the textbook calculation of the primordial perturbation spectrum implicitly ignores the consequences of the breakdown of spacetime at some new fundamental lengthscale . for a clear exposition of the standard treatment of perturbations , including a discussion of the effect of boundary conditions , see @xcite . in string theory",
    "the effective minimum length can be significantly larger than the planck length , by perhaps one or two orders of magnitude @xcite . in this case , the ratio between the inflationary hubble scale , @xmath1 , and the scale of new stringy physics , @xmath2 can be as large as @xmath10 .",
    "dimensional analysis alone suggests that any modifications to the perturbation spectrum induced by including this minimum length will be a function of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is , of course , unknown . if @xmath12 is unity , then there is at least a corner of parameter space where we might expect potentially observable modifications to the spectrum .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath12 , any modifications to the spectrum are most likely unobservable . string theory and other candidate unified models",
    "are not sufficiently mature to permit an _ ab initio _ analysis of perturbation generation , and predict the value of @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , all studies of trans - planckian modifications to the inflationary perturbation spectrum require some ansatz which , while motivated by our understanding of stringy / planckian physics , introduces a degree of arbitrariness into the calculation .",
    "this ansatz necessarily modifies either the initial conditions or the evolution of the perturbations .",
    "generically , modifications to the initial conditions produce changes in the spectrum on the order of @xmath6 , whereas modifications to the evolution result in changes on the order of @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that no calculation has predicted that the modifications vanish completely .",
    "normally , this lack of theoretical consensus would deter detailed studies of the observational consequences of any given model of trans - planckian physics .",
    "however , even a small possibility that the fingerprints of planckian or stringy physics can be found on the sky provides more than enough motivation for us to take a careful look at what constraints can be established with present data or future measurements . in this paper , we focus on one model of trans - planckian physics , first suggested by danielsson in the case of de sitter space @xcite and generalized to non - de sitter backgrounds by easther , greene , kinney and shiu @xcite .",
    "there is nothing intrinsically special about this model  our analysis is effectively a case study of what might be achieved when one has a specific model to test . in particular",
    ", we do not enter into the debate as to whether or not such `` truncated @xmath14-vacua '' are self - consistent with respect to being well - defined in the ultraviolet limit or with respect to their suitability as initial conditions for inflation .",
    "we simply consider the model as a reasonable case study for investigating the discriminatory power of forthcoming cmb observations .",
    "the one general statement we can make is that it is far more likely that trans - planckian effects will have an observable impact on the spectrum if inflation takes place at a relatively high energy scale . in principle",
    ", inflation can occur at almost any scale high enough to allow for baryogenesis and nucleosynthesis in the post - inflationary universe  and this can be far below the gut scale .",
    "however , since we only expect a detectable signal if @xmath6 is comparatively large , we are pushed into the corner of parameter space where @xmath2 is small ( compared to the planck scale ) while @xmath1 is roughly gut - scale . a small @xmath2",
    "( two orders of magnitude below the planck scale , say ) is entirely consistent with string theory , whereas @xmath1 is effectively a free parameter .",
    "an upper bound on @xmath1 arises from the limits on the tensor component to the primordial perturbation spectrum  which is potentially observable via both the temperature anisotropies in the cmb , and the b - mode of the cmb polarization .",
    "( a rough upper limit on @xmath1 from the wmap data is @xmath15 . )",
    "it is very easy for inflation to happen at a low enough scale to ensure that a primordial tensor spectrum is effectively unobservable by any conceivable experiment @xcite .",
    "however , if we were to observe a contribution to the cmb that appears to be related to planckian or stringy physics , there is a strong likelihood that we would be in the region of parameter space where @xmath1 was large enough in order to ensure that the tensor contribution was also detectable .",
    "there are important consequences to this qualitative correlation between trans - planckian contributions to the cmb and the tensor perturbations .",
    "first , it further raises the stakes for high precision measurements of the cmb .",
    "we already know that an observable tensor spectrum fixes the inflationary energy scale and rules out some of inflation s competitors , such as the ekpyrotic @xcite and pre - big bang scenarios @xcite , and that single field models of inflation must satisfy a set of consistency conditions @xcite .",
    "however , on top of these achievements , determining @xmath1 would let us put direct constraints on the scale of new physics in any specific model of trans - planckian physics , since @xmath2 would be the only remaining free parameter . if @xmath1 turns out to be at the high end of the permitted range , it increases the likelihood that we will be able to see any trans - planckian signal that is there to be found .",
    "finally , one us [ re ] recently argued that a high value of @xmath1 during inflation is naturally correlated with a scalar spectrum with a significant running index ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "we do not consider models with substantially broken scale invariance in this paper , but do incorporate a non - zero running into our analysis below .    from a practical perspective , if we perform a fit to cmb data with a model that includes trans - planckian effects , it is important to include the tensor modes in any analysis , since the same parameter ( @xmath1 ) that governs their amplitude and scale dependence is also likely to appear in the trans - planckian corrections .",
    "conversely , simply observing an oscillatory spectrum would not be enough to prove that planck / string scale physics had left an imprint on the cmb  one can produce the same result purely with physics at lower energy @xcite .",
    "this problem has been addressed in several previous analyses .",
    "the first computation of trans - planckian modifications to the spectrum was @xcite , which used a fisher matrix calculation to predict that the planck mission will put stringent bounds on a oscillatory component in the fundamental spectrum .",
    "however , this analysis marginalized over a small subset of cosmological parameters , and the use of a fisher matrix in this context is problematic @xcite .",
    "subsequent calculations have been less optimistic . in particular",
    ", @xcite argued that any reasonable modulation to the spectrum is most likely unobservable , although we will argue that their pessimism is probably misplaced .",
    "okamoto and lim @xcite looked at the constraints on a general superimposed oscillation to the spectrum .",
    "they varied several cosmological parameters as well as those describing the oscillation , and concluded that values of @xmath17 might be reached with a cosmic variance limited survey , but ignored the role of tensor modes .",
    "martin and ringeval , @xcite have studied models with independent parameters governing the amplitude and frequency of the trans - planckian modulation .",
    "their analysis is distinguished by the possibility that very high - frequency oscillations with non - negligible amplitude are considered , with the frequency of the oscillations producing the primary constraint on @xmath6 . in such a case , they conclude that very strong constraints are possible on the value of @xmath6 , even when restricted to _",

    "there are several ways to estimate parameters , and their likely uncertainties , in cmb data .",
    "in addition to the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods discussed below , two widely used approaches have been grid searches in parameter space and fisher matrices , which provide theoretical estimates of the likely accuracy that can be obtained with a given measurement . a key observation that applies to all methods",

    "we include the effect of weak lensing on all power spectra , since this is the `` theoretical limit '' in the accuracy of the measurement - weak lensing aliases power between multipoles and tends to smooth out small - scale oscillations in the data .",
    "therefore , any of the further uncertainties that must be accounted for in a practical cmb experiment , such as foreground removal , partial sky coverage etc , will degrade the constraints obtainable on the trans - planckian parameters relative to those found in this study .    for the simulated `` data '' , we consider two cases : one with significant primordial tensor modes ( denoted case h ) , and one with an undetectably small contribution of primordial tensors ( denoted case l ) .",

    "our fiducial models also do not contain any running of the primordial scalar spectral index ; however , the effect of this parameter would be degenerate with a very long wavelength trans - planckian modulation .",
    "hence we marginalize over this parameter in our analysis .    in the practical implementation of the mcmc , we ran 16 chains for case h and 32 chains for case l , each started at random @xmath103 steps away from the fiducial model . by making use of preliminary test chains ,",
    "the proposal distribution was calibrated using the covariance between the parameters in order to minimize correlations ; the chains were configured to step in the principal directions of the parameter covariance matrix optimal @xmath191% acceptance rates for case h ; for case l , only a few % acceptance rates were achieved even after several recalibrations of the proposal matrix , indicating the complexity of the likelihood surface .",

    "the presence of `` islands '' in the likelihood space meant that the chains converged relatively slowly , compared to what is typical for a fit to cmb observations when the trans - planckian terms are absent .",
    "in fact , we stopped the chains for case l slightly short of full convergence , but long after the predicted parameter regions had stabilized .",

    "the constraint on @xmath6 differs by an order of magnitude between case h and case l. this reinforces the point made above that _ if _ our universe happens to be in a favorable part of the parameter space where the energy scale of inflation is high enough to produce an observable amplitude of primordial tensor modes , then one has a significantly improved chance of detecting any trans - planckian modifications to the spectrum whose properties are similar to those of the case tested here .",
    "the cosmological parameters are constrained at the @xmath196 level except for the scalar spectral index and the amplitude of fluctuations at @xmath197 , which are only constrained at the @xmath198 level .",
    "therefore , another cosmological data - set that aids in constraining these parameters ( for example , the proposed ska survey , @xcite ) will minimize the degeneracies with these parameters shown in figs.[fig : params_bigr ] and [ fig : params_tinyr ] and improve parameter constraints further @xcite .",
    "we believe that this analysis is the most thorough investigation of the detectability of a trans - planckian modulation to the primordial power spectrum that has been performed to date .",
    "we consider three complementary approaches  a simple grid search , a fisher matrix evaluation of the likely error ellipses , and a monte carlo markov chain fit to a simulated cmb spectrum , and find that they are all in broad agreement .",
    "moreover , we also explain the `` islands '' seen in the likelihood space in previous papers on this topic @xcite , and show that their distribution and properties can be understood and reproduced via a simple analytic argument .",
    "the approach we have taken here is analyze a _ specific _",
    "ansatz for introducing a minimum length into the calculation of the perturbation spectrum in a general model of slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "we do not claim that this model is a correct description of the trans - planckian contribution to the perturbation spectrum , but intend it as a case study of what might be possible if one has a specific and well - motivated correction to the spectrum that leads to a @xmath18 dependent modulation .",
    "there is considerable theoretical uncertainty surrounding this point , and it is entirely possible that a future rigorous calculation of the perturbation spectrum within string theory or some other model of ultra high energy physics will predict that there is _ no _ modulation to be observed , and the bound calculated here will not apply .",
    "we believe that the constraint obtained here is applicable to a general class of modulated spectra . in practice",
    ", one can imagine adding an arbitrary modulation to the primordial spectrum , as considered by okamoto and lim @xcite , in which case one has parameters which describe the amplitude , wavelength , and phase of the modulation as a function of @xmath18 . in our model",
    "there are only two free parameters  the phase of the modulation , and @xmath6 which determines the amplitude",
    ". the phase will always be arbitrary in the absence of detailed theory that matches specific scales in the present universe to those during inflation , which would require a full understanding of the post - inflationary expansion history and the physics of reheating , while the amplitude is directly related to the scale of new physics , which is what we are trying to measure .",
    "however , the wavelength of the oscillation turns out to be given in terms of the slow - roll parameter @xmath38 , which is itself directly related to the tensor / scalar ratio @xmath5 .",
    "this dependence is easy to understand , since the form of the modulation is not determined by the ( fixed ) boundary condition , but by the slow variation in the horizon size @xmath199 with time .",
    "the precise functional form of the connection between @xmath38 and the modulated spectrum may vary in other specific models .",
    "however , it is very likely that the modulation can always be expressed in terms of @xmath6 and the scale dependence of @xmath1  or thus @xmath38 , and perhaps the higher order slow - roll parameters , which are also reachable through their contribution to the scalar spectral index .",
    "consequently , we believe that the results we have seen here will generalize to other modulated spectra , even though we have reduced the number of trans - planckian parameters relative to those considered by okamoto and lim .",
    "the second general conclusion we draw is that the detectability of any modulated spectrum depends on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "since the wavelength of the modulation depends on @xmath38 , detecting the primordial tensors provides an orthogonal constraint on the value of this parameter , and thus constrains the trans - planckian corrections .",
    "since @xmath1 fixes the energy scale at which inflation occurs , it is arguably the single most interesting cosmological parameter that is not currently fixed by observations .",
    "the analysis here simply adds to the importance of this parameter , since we have shown that measuring @xmath1 will put tighter bounds on any trans - planckian corrections to the spectrum .    since the theoretical uncertainty about the form and existence of these corrections is yet to be resolved , we can not advocate mounting an observational campaign solely to look for this kind of signal . however , there is already good and sufficient reason to make an all out effort to measure @xmath1 during inflation , via high precision measurements of the cmb and particularly its polarization .",
    "we believe that mission planners will want to be aware of the possibility that precision cmb measurements may potentially probe physics at the string scale , since this will not add to the cost of any mission but represents an exciting and additional use of the data they can be expected to return .    in quantitative terms , we see that the with a large ( @xmath200 ) value of the tensor to scalar ratio , a `` perfect '' map of the primordial temperature and polarization anisotropies to the cmb could rule out a trans - planckian modulation to the spectrum at the @xmath201 level for @xmath202 .",
    "this is roughly the same as the result reported by okamoto and lim .",
    "we vary a larger set of cosmological parameters than they do , which reduces the level of precision we can hope for .",
    "however by adding the tensor contribution to the analysis and removing a free parameter from the specification of modulation we can tighten the bound . like okamoto and lim ,",
    "we consider a perfect measurement of the cmb and any real experiment will be contaminated by imperfectly removed foregrounds .",
    "consequently , we believe that a value of @xmath6 on the order of 0.01 represents a reasonable lower bound on what can be detected in practice , provided the amplitude of the tensor contribution is significant . on the other hand , adding other orthogonal datasets , such as a measurement of @xmath179 and the late time expansion history of the universe from a snap - like mission , or constraints on the primordial spectrum from future large scale structure surveys will further constrain the error ellipses relative to those which can be achieved via the cmb alone .    at this point , the theoretical uncertainty surrounding this calculation makes it unwise to push this analysis significantly further .",
    "however , we believe that considerable progress has been made in understanding the physical issues surrounding the trans - planckian corrections to the primordial spectrum over the last few years .",
    "consequently , it is not excessively optimistic to hope that the remaining issues can be resolved on a shorter timescale than it will take to perform a measurement of the cmb that even approaches the precision we have assumed in our analysis . in this light , we are particularly interested in the effective field theory approach taken in @xcite , and extended in the more recent preprint @xcite . in this case , the operators which can contribute to a modification to the spectrum can be cataloged within effective field theory . from the observational perspective , an analogous calculation to the one presented here",
    "will constrain the values of the prefactors in front of these operators , and we intend to pursue this in future work .",

    "<S> we examine the constraints cosmological observations can place on any trans - planckian corrections to the primordial spectrum of perturbations underlying the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on models of trans - planckian physics which lead to a modulated primordial spectrum . rather than looking at a generic modulated spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on a specific model , and are intended as a case study for the sort of constraints one could hope to apply on a well - motivated model of trans - planckian physics . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for three different approaches  a grid search in a subset of the overall parameter space , a fisher matrix estimate of the likely error ellipses , and a monte carlo markov chain fit to a simulated cmb sky . </S>",
    "<S> as was seen in previous analyses , the likelihood space has multiple peaks , and we show that their distribution can be reproduced via a simple semi - analytic argument . </S>",
    "<S> all three methods lead to broadly similar results . </S>",
    "<S> we vary 10 cosmological parameters ( including two related to the trans - planckian terms ) and show that the amplitude of the tensor perturbations is directly correlated with the detectability of any trans - planckian modulation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this is likely to be true for any trans - planckian modulation in the paradigm of slow - roll inflation . for the specific case we consider , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that if the tensor to scalar ratio , @xmath0 , the ratio between the inflationary hubble scale @xmath1 , and the scale of new physics @xmath2 has to be on the order of @xmath3 if the modulation is detectable at the 2@xmath4 level . for a lower value of @xmath5 , the bound on @xmath6 becomes looser . </S>"
