    "the most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction , while blocking current in the opposite direction , thus enabling the unidirectional current flux and the rectification of an electrical signal . to date , many contributions have been made for the rectification of different types of energy flows .",

    "reconfigurable light - driven isolator attracts much attention due to its capacity of switching on / off the interband transition , which manifests itself as the transition from nonreciprocal to reciprocal response , by using a control light beam  @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting phenomenon named _",
    "reversible optical nonreciprocity _ was proposed where a nonreciprocal response can be flipped from transmitting a signal predominantly in one direction to opposite one  @xcite .",

    "the possibility of dynamical manipulation has not been addressed yet . by offering such possibilities for dynamically tuning of the nonreciprocity",
    ", one can direct the energy flow in real - time and thus realize more advanced control of the wave propagating systems . for example , diodes with tunable forward and backward transmission rates were proven to be significant in manipulating the properties of the wave rectification  @xcite . furthermore , if the properties of nonreciprocity can be controlled instantaneously , a lot of basic wave propagation devices , such as switch , router and rectifier etc .",

    "such system reveals rich nonlinear dynamics and thus facilitates one s manipulation of the optical bistable scattering  @xcite . in this paper",
