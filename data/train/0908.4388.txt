    "human behavior , as an academic issue in science , has a history about one century from watson @xcite . as a joint interest of sociology , psychology and economics ,",
    "human behavior has been extensively investigated during the last decades .",
    "a basic assumption embedded in the previous analysis on human dynamics is that its temporal statistics are uniform and stationary , which can be properly described by a poisson process .",
    "accordingly , the interevent time distribution should have an exponential tail @xcite .",
    "however , through studying the distributions of interevent time of the human behavior such as the people to send out or reply e - mail and surface mail , albert barabsi discovered that these human behaviors present obvious deviation to the poisson process : long time silent and short time high frequency eruption simultaneously present in these human behaviors , and their distributions of interevent time have power law fat tail @xcite .    from e - mail communications @xcite to surface mail communications @xcite and short message communications @xcite , from financial activities to library loans @xcite , from web browsing @xcite to on - line",
    "movie watchings @xcite , and more and more examples show that the distributions of interevent time of the human behavior can not be described by a poisson process but may use power function to fit well . according to the previous studies about human dynamics",
    ", we find that its methodology , excavating statistical laws from the historical records of human activities , can apply to analyze other issues .",
    "for instance , we can also use some of those datasets to quantify the herd behavior of an individual , that is to say , following the opinions of the majority of people in his / her social surrounding in an irrational way .    with the development of information technology ,",
    "web surfing has become a part of people s daily life , including e - mail communication , dealing with financial matters , reading news online , browsing web , downloading software and so on . in the cyber world",
    ", @xmath0 forum provides people a platform for mutual communication .",
    "those behaviors like `` lurking , spamming , sofast '' , etc .",
    "are the ways in which netizens publicly express their ideas .",
    "the means of expression is so unique for its dual role of `` openness '' and `` concealment '' .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 forum is loved by the majority of internet users .    on the @xmath0 forum ,",
    "the new threads and internet users are increasing , and the internet users can browse information and express their own points . in the process of browsing information and expressing their own points , the most common group is formed on the @xmath0 forum , that is to say , browsing the posts of the same subject will form a provisional group , different themes has different groups .",
    "however , in the provisional group , some people simply browse information , and others will publish their own opinions",
    ". then there are the amounts of view and reply on the @xmath0 forum .",
    "so what is the difference between the different groups , and how are these differences reflected are the interesting issues to be researched . in our paper",
    ", we focus on the actions of internet users through the @xmath0 forum to solve these problems .",
    "the dates come from the @xmath3 forum and @xmath4 forum , the first one is the largest chinese community and the other one is the current leader in free online chat rooms .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sect2 ] , we present that the amounts of view and reply of posts which follow the power law distributions and have different power exponents . in sec.[sect3 ] , we address the nonlinearity relationship of the amounts of view and reply of posts and we also calculate the fitted line to characterize the forum . according to the fitted line",
