    "quantum information processings are proposed , many of which require maximally entangled states as resources , _ e.g. _ , quantum teleportation and dense coding _ etc_@xcite .",
    "hence , it is often desired to generate maximally entangled states . however , the realized state is not necessarily a maximally entangled state .",
    "thus , entanglement concentration is used for producing maximally entangled states ( mes ) from partially entangled pure states only by local operation and classical communication ( locc ) , while entanglement distillation is used for producing them from partially entangled mixed states by locc .",
    "therefore , entanglement concentration is an important issue in the field of quantum information .    in information theory",
    ", we often assume that the system is prepared as the independent and identical multiple copies of the given state .",
    "such a condition is called independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) condition . under this condition ,",
    "et al_.@xcite showed that the amount of entanglement of a partially entangled pure state @xmath0 is described by the entropy @xmath1 of its partial traced state @xmath2 , which is called the reduced density matrix .",
    "that is , they proved that an mes with size @xmath3 can be asymptotically produced from @xmath4 identical copies of the state @xmath0 with a high enough probability .",
    "furthermore , independently of the form of @xmath0 , hayashi and matsumoto constructed a protocol satisfying the above property , which is called universal @xcite .",
    "however , in the correlated physical system , the state of the total system can not be regarded as independent and identical copies of a given state .",
    "in such a case , we have to treat general partial entangled pure state between two distinct parties . indeed , this model is not so unnatural because the state on the total system is pure when this system is isolated from the other system . in this paper , as a general asymptotic method to treat this model asymptotically , we focus on the information spectrum method and apply it to entanglement concentration . the information spectrum method has been developed by han and verd @xcite for discussing general sequence of information sources / channels , and been established as a unified method to information theory in han s textbook@xcite .",
    "indeed , this method has been applied to quantum information theory , for example , to quantum hypothesis testing@xcite and quantum channel coding@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply this method to entanglement concentration , and characterize the asymptotic production rate of a general sequence of partially entangled pure states without any assumption .",
    "the information spectrum method used in this paper is slightly different from the original han - verd s method , and is close to nagaoka - hayashi s method@xcite .    in the derivation of our general asymptotic formulas",
    ", we essentially use the majorization method established by nielsen@xcite . based on this method",
    ", he developed a necessary and sufficient condition for the possibility of transforming from a partially entangled pure state @xmath5 to another entangled pure state @xmath6 by using locc between the two parties @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this condition is characterized only by the eigenvalues of their reduced densities @xmath9 .    moreover , even in the i.i.d .",
    "case , the knowledge of the asymptotic production rate is not sufficient for estimating the production rate of mes for a given finite number of copies . in channel coding or source coding , for this analysis , we usually focus on the error exponents , _",
    "i.e. _ , the exponential rate of error probability because the error goes to @xmath10 exponentially when we choose our code suitably . in entanglement concentration ,",
    "when we fix the production rate to a constant number less than the entropy rate , the optimal failure probability goes to @xmath10 exponentially .",
    "hence , based on its exponential rate ( failure exponent ) , we can roughly estimate the failure probability for a given finite number of copies . as preceding researches ,",
    "et al_.@xcite derived the failure exponent of entanglement concentration in the i.i.d .  case based on the method of types , and hayashi and matsumoto @xcite did that of their universal entanglement concentration protocol . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the failure exponent of entanglement concentration in a more general setting .    in most problems in information theory , in the i.i.d .",
    "case , the correct ( or success ) probability exponentially goes to 0 when the rate is strictly better than the optimal rate .",
    "this exponential rate is called the correct ( or success ) exponent , and is one of famouse issues in information theory .",
    "et al_.@xcite and hayashi and matsumoto @xcite treated the success exponent of entanglement concentration in the i.i.d .  case .",
    "this paper proceed to the general sequence of partially entangled pure states .",
    "one may think that such an exponential treatment is not essential .",
    "it is , however , more difficult to obtain the error and correct exponents asymptotically and tightly than the asymptotical optimal production rate .",
    "hence , in order to derive these tight bounds of both exponents , we need better and more simple non - asymptotic evaluations .",
    "that is , such a non - asymptotic evaluation should be a better and more simple approximation for the optimal value .",
    "therefore , even though the optimal correct exponent is useless , the non - asymptotic evaluations used for its derivation is quite useful .",
    "furthermore , the optimal rates with exponential constraint are characterized by rnyi entropy in the i.i.d . case . in this paper",
    ", we derive the same formulas under a weak assumption for the rnyi entropy . using these formulas",
    ", we characterize the optimal rates based on the partition function .",
    "finally , we have to explain our formulation of entanglement concentration .",
    "there are two formulations in source coding .",
    "one is fixed length , in which the coding length is fixed , _",
    "i.e. _ , is independent of the input data .",
    "the other is variable - length , in which the coding length is variable , _",
    "i.e. _ , depends on the input data . similarly to source coding ,",
    "we can consider two similar formulations in entanglement concentration . in bennett _",
    "et al._@xcite s protocol and hayashi and matsumoto@xcite s protocol , a local measurement is required as the first step , and the length of the mse generated finally depends on the data of this local measurement .",
    "hence , their protocol is a variable - length entanglement concentration .    on the other hand , based on nielsen s result@xcite ,",
    "et al_.@xcite discussed entanglement concentration protocols producing the mes with the fixed size .",
    "hence , such protocols are called fixed - length entanglement concentration , which are classified into two formulations as follows . in the first formulation ,",
    "we produce , without a failure , an approximately mes from a partially entangled pure state .",
    "its performance is represented by the size of the mes and the fidelity between the appropriate mes and the final state .",
    "this kind of entanglement concentration is called deterministic fixed - length entanglement concentration ( dflec ) . in the other formulation",
    ", we produce an mes itself , allowing a failure probability , from a partially entangled pure state .",
    "the performance of this protocol is evaluated by the size of the mes and the failure probability .",
    "this protocol is called a probabilistic fixed - length entanglement concentration ( pflec ) .",
    "et al_.@xcite treated these two formulations in the i.i.d .  case . in this paper",
    ", we discuss them in a more general model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] , we give the mathematical definitions of the optimal rates with respective conditions , ( constant constraint , exponetial constraint ) for the genereal sequence of partially entangled pure state in two formulations of flec . as the main results , characterizations of these quantities are given based on information spectrum .",
    "that is , we discover a general relation between the performance of entanglement concentration and the eigenvalues of the reduced density ( partially traced state ) . in section [ s3 ] ,",
    "the optimal rates of flecs are characterized by the rnyi entropy . in section [ s3 - 2 ] , we apply these formulas to the case when the reduced density is given as a thermal state . in section [ s4 ] ,",
    "the performances of the two flec types in a non - asymptotic case are characterized by applications of nielsen s result @xcite and lo and popescu s results@xcite . in section [ s5 ] ,",
    "the main result is verified by applying several lemmas described in section [ s4 ] to an asymptotic case . in section [ s7 ] ,",
    "the relation between entanglement concentration and random number generation is discussed .",
    "the appendix [ as1 ] summarizes relations for the quantum analogue of the information spectrums based on the original definition@xcite , which are necessary for verifying the main result .",
    "when the two distinct parties , alice and bob , have their respective systems @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the total system is described by the tensor product space @xmath11 . in quantum information , as is mentioned in section [ s1 ] , one of main issues is the characterization of entanglement between these distinct parties .",
    "if the state on total syste is a pure state @xmath12 , it is known that its entanglement between two parties can be characterized by the reduced density ( partially traced state ) @xmath13 . in particular ,",
    "if the reduced density @xmath14 is the completely mixed state @xmath15 , it is called maximally entagled , where @xmath16 denotes the dimension of the system @xmath7 . hence ,",
    "if the pure state @xmath17 is maximally entangled , there exist completely orthogonal basis @xmath18 and @xmath19 on @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively such that @xmath20 while any quantum operation is mathematically described by trace - preserving completely positive ( tp - cp ) map , in the entanglement concentration of the initial pure state @xmath21 on distinct two parties @xmath7 and @xmath8 , our operation is often restricted to a quantum operation with an locc implementation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "hence , a deterministic fixed - length entanglement concentration ( dflec ) is an locc quantum operation @xmath22 together with a maximally entangled state @xmath23 , on a subspace @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is described as @xmath25 . since this protocol",
    "@xmath25 transforms the initial pure state @xmath26 to the final state @xmath27 , its performance is evaluated by the fidelity @xmath28 and the size @xmath29 of @xmath23 , which equals @xmath30 .    for a rigid analysis of the probabilistic fixed - length entanglement concentration",
    ", we have to discuss a measuring operation that describes a quantum measurement with the final state as well as the probability distribution of the measured data .",
    "the measuring operation is given as a cp map valued measure @xmath31 whose sum is a tp - cp map ; _ i.e. _ , every @xmath32 is a cp map , and @xmath33 is a tp - cp map .",
    "it is often called an instrument . when we perform a quantum measurement corresponding to @xmath31 on the system with a state @xmath14 , we obtain the measured data @xmath34 and the final state @xmath35 with the probability @xmath36 .",
    "hence , a probabilistic fixed - length entanglement concentration ( pflec ) of an initial pure state @xmath37 is a two - valued instruments @xmath38 with an locc implementation satisfying that @xmath39 is a maximally entangled state @xmath40 on a subspace @xmath24 , where @xmath41 is abbreviated to @xmath42 .",
    "that is , the event @xmath43 corresponds to success , and the event @xmath10 does to failure .",
    "thus , its performance is characterized by the failure probability @xmath44 and the size @xmath45 of the final maximally entangled state .    here",
    ", we briefly discuss the relation between two kinds of fixed - length entanglement concentrations . for any pflec @xmath38 of @xmath21 ,",
    "the pair @xmath46 becomes a dflec and its fidelity between the final state and the desired maximally entangled state @xmath39 is greater than the success probability of the dflec @xmath38 : @xmath47 \\ge \\tr i_1(\\phi ) .",
    "\\label{c51}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , for any a given pflec protocol , there exists a dflec protocol whose performance is better than the given pflec protocol .    in the quantum system ,",
    "if @xmath4 systems are prepared identically to the system @xmath48 , the total system is described by @xmath49 . if the state of every system @xmath48 is the pure state @xmath21 and if each system is independently prepared , the state of the total system is written by the tensor product pure state @xmath50 .",
    "such a case is called the i.i.d . case .",
    "however , even if the state of each system coincides with each other , if they are not independent of each other , the state of total system is not a tensor product state . in order to treat such a general case ,",
    "we focus on a general sequence of the pair of the joint system with distinct two parties @xmath51 and @xmath52 and the partially entangled pure state @xmath53 with an asymptotic situation .",
    "note that , in this notation , the space @xmath54 and @xmath52 are generalizations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is a generalization of the @xmath4-tensor product vector @xmath50 .    in order to discuss the asymptotic optimal performance in such a general case , we optimize the production rate of mes with three asymptotic constraints for the failure probability or fidelity . concerning the pflec , we focus on the following conditions :    * constant constraint : the asymptotic failure probability is less than a fixed constant . * exponential constraint for the failure probability : when we choose a good dflec protocol , failure probability goes to @xmath10 exponentially .",
    "hence , as another criterion , we restrict our dflec satisfying that the exponent of failure probability is greater than a fixed exponent . * exponential constraint for the success probability : if we choose a bad dflec , the success probability goes to @xmath10 exponentially . among such pflec protocols , if this exponent , _",
    "i.e. _ , the success exponent , is greater , the protocol is worse .",
    "hence , we can consider the optimization of the production rate of mes with the constraint that the success exponent is less than a fixed exponent .",
    "thus , concerning pflec , we focus on the following values : @xmath58    in the dflec case , we obtain several criteria by replacing the success probability in the above discussion by the fidelity .",
    "that is , we can define the following values : @xmath59    hence , it is trivial from ( [ c51 ] ) that @xmath60 in this paper , we treat a quantum analogue of information spectrums to analyze the above values .",
    "for such an analysis , we need the following definitions . for a self - adjoint operator @xmath61",
    ", we can denote the projection @xmath62 by @xmath63 , where the spectral decomposition is given by @xmath64 .",
    "we can define the projections @xmath65 , @xmath66 , _",

    "let @xmath67 be the reduced density @xmath68 and define @xmath69 when the limit @xmath70 exists , we denote it by @xmath71 .",
    "these definitions can also be written as @xmath72 where every @xmath73 is an eigenvalue of @xmath67 and can be regarded as a probability distribution .",
    "hence , the quantity @xmath74 , and @xmath71 denotes the degree of concentration of the @xmath75-dimensional subspace .",
    "note that the function @xmath76 decreases monotonically , while the function @xmath71 increases monotonically .",
    "indeed , in the classical case , the value @xmath77 gives the asymptotic performances of fixed - length source coding@xcite and uniform random number generation@xcite with asymptotic constant constraint .",
    "moreover , the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath71 gives the asymptotic optimal performance of source coding with the exponential constraint@xcite and that of simulation of random process with kl divergence criterion@xcite . as is mentioned in section [ s7 ] , @xmath71 gives the asymptotic optimal performance of intrinsic randomness with kl divergence criterion@xcite .",
    "as is mentioned in the following main theorem , the optimal production rate of mes can be characterized by how densely the eigen values of the reduced density matrix concentrate a small space .    without any assumption , for every @xmath78",
    "$ ] we have @xmath79 when the limit ( [ 65 ] ) exists and there exists a real number @xmath80 such that @xmath81 , we have @xmath82    this theorem is proved in section [ s5 ] after preparing the appropriate discussion .",
    "as is mentioned in nagaoka and hayashi@xcite the quantum versions of @xmath74 , and @xmath71 give the asymptotic performances of fixed - length source coding .",
    "in particular , the optimal rate with the constraint for the constant error exponent is given as @xmath83 which is almost similar to @xmath84 .",
