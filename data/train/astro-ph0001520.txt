    "the development of a new generation of multi - object spectrographs , exemplified by the ` two degree field ' , or 2df , multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , has opened up whole new areas of astronomical survey science .",
    "one particular area , which we discuss in this paper , is the opportunity to make a truly complete spectroscopic survey of a given area on the sky , down to well determined , faint limits , irrespective of image morphology or any other preselection of target type .",
    "the _ fornax spectroscopic survey _ , or , seeks to exploit the huge multiplexing advantage of 2df by surveying a region of 12 square degrees centred on the fornax cluster of galaxies .",
    "it will encompass both cluster galaxies , of a wide range of types and magnitudes , and background and foreground galaxies ( over a similarly wide range of morphologies ) , as well as galactic stars , qsos and any unusual or rare objects .",
    "although many surveys of nearby clusters have been made over the past 20 years or more , these are all limited in several crucial aspects .",
    "spectroscopic surveys exist , but typically only of the few dozen brightest cluster galaxies ( and any background interlopers in the top few magnitudes of the cluster luminosity function ) .",
    "photometric surveys , of course , go much deeper , but such studies must be of a statistical nature ( e.g.  subtracting off the expected background numbers ; smith et al .",
    "1997 ) , or rely on subjective judgements of likely cluster membership based on morphology , surface brightness or colour ( e.g.  ferguson 1989 ) . of particular concern",
    "is the surface brightness ; low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) seen towards a cluster are conventionally assumed to be members , while apparently faint , but high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs ) are presumed to be luminous objects in the background ( e.g.  sandage , binggeli , & tammann 1985 ) .",
    "the failure of either assumption , i.e.  the existence of large background lsbgs ( such as the serendipitously discovered malin 1 ; bothun et al .",
    "1987 ) or of a population of high surface brightness ( compact ) dwarfs in the cluster ( drinkwater & gregg 1998 ) , can have a dramatic effect on our perception of the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that a population of extremely compact galaxies ( either in the cluster or beyond ) could masquerade as stars and hence be missed altogether from galaxy samples .",
    "examples have previously been found in , for example , qso surveys , but again these are serendipitous discoveries and hard to quantify ( see drinkwater et al .",
    "1999a = paper  ii , and references therein ) .",
    "few previous attempts at all - object surveys have been made .",
    "the one most similar to ours is probably that of morton and tritton in the early 1980s .",
    "they obtained around 600 objective prism spectra and 100 slit spectra for objects in a 0.31 square degree region of background sky ( i.e.  no prominent cluster ) over the course of a 5 year period ( morton , krug & tritton 1985 ) .",
    "more recently colless et al .  ( 1993 ) obtained spectra of about 100 objects in a small area of sky and small magnitude range in order to investigate the completeness of faint galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "our overall survey will therefore represent a huge increase in the volume of data and in addition will give a uniquely complete picture of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that the huge galaxy surveys planned , with 2df ( folkes et al .",
    "1999 ; colless 1999 ) or the sloan digital survey ( gunn 1995 ; loveday & pier 1998 ) will not address such problems , since their galaxy samples will be pre - selected from photometric surveys and will only include objects classified as galaxies and not of too low surface brightness , thus removing both ends of any potentially wide range of galaxy parameters .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the design and aims of our all - object _ fornax spectroscopic survey _ and present initial results on the velocity distributions . section  [ sec_survey ] gives a technical definition of the survey , describing the relevant features of the 2df spectrograph , the selection of our target catalogue and the calibration of this input catalogue . in section  [ sec_science ] we discuss the scientific aims of the survey and summarise the types and numbers of objects we expect to observe . in section  [ sec_obs ] we discuss the spectroscopic observations and observational strategy .",
    "we describe the technique we have developed to identify and classify objects automatically from the 2df spectra and give some examples from our initial observations .",
    "section  [ sec_initsci ] gives the initial redshift results and section  [ sec_summary ] summarises the survey work to date .",
    "in this section we describe the basic parameters of the .",
    "we start with the relevant technical details of the 2df spectrograph , and then discuss our selection of targets from the digitised photographic sky survey plates and the calibration of our input catalogues .",
    "the 2df facility ( taylor , cannon & parker 1998 ) is probably the most complex ground - based astronomical instrument built to date . via a straightforward ` top - end ' change the capability of the 3.9-manglo - australian telescope is transformed into an unique wide - field multi - fibre spectroscopic survey instrument .",
    "up to 400 fibres are available at any one time for rapid configuration over the full two - degree diameter focal surface via a highly accurate robotic positioner mounted in situ .",
    "each 2  diameter fibre can be placed to an accuracy of 0.3  in less than 10 seconds .",
    "the input target positions must be accurate to 0.3  r.m.s .",
    "or better over the whole two - degree field to avoid vignetting of the fibre entrance apertures .",
    "this requirement is only for relative positions ; the absolute accuracy of a complete set of targets and guide stars need only be 12  as the guide stars will then centre all the targets accurately .",
    "the wide field is provided by a highly sophisticated multi - component corrector with in - built atmospheric dispersion compensator . in a novel arrangement 2df",
    "can simultaneously observe 400 target objects on the sky at the same time that a further 400 fibres are being configured using the robotic positioner on one of the two available ` field plates ' ( focal surfaces ) .",
    "once observations and configurations have been completed ( usually over the same timescale ) a tumbling mechanism allows the newly configured field plate to point at the sky whilst the previously observed field can be re - configured for the next target field . in this way rapid field inter - change is provided for an extremely efficient observing environment .",
    "each set of 400 fibres feeds two spectrographs which accept 200 fibres each .",
    "these are mounted on the 2df top end ring and can produce low to medium resolution spectra on the dedicated @xmath4 tek ccds",
    ".    the 2df is now operating at close to the original specifications anticipated for this most complex of instruments ( lewis , glazebrook & taylor , 1998 ) .",
    "field configuration times of about 1 hour for 400 fibres permit rapid cycling of target fields and have enabled excellent progress to be made with our complete survey .",
    "we chose the fornax cluster for this study because it is a well - studied , compact , nearby southern galaxy cluster suited to this type of survey .",
    "we and several other groups have made photometric or small - scale spectroscopic surveys of the region ( e.g.  ferguson 1989 ; davies et al .  1988 ; drinkwater & gregg 1998 , hilker et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the published spectroscopic samples have either been very small or have concentrated on the brighter cluster galaxies ( jones & jones 1980 ; drinkwater et al .",
    "2000a ) . a search of ned in our central 2df field ( number 1 in table  [ tab_fields ] ) found only 42 objects brighter than @xmath5 with measured redshifts : 30 cluster galaxies , 6 background galaxies and 6 qsos .",
    "with 2df we can now measure the redshifts of some 700900 galaxies and quasars in this same field .",
    "the fornax cluster is concentrated within one united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) sky survey plate and our survey will comprise four separate 2df fields which are listed in table  [ tab_fields ] .",
    "we show the distribution of our fields on the sky in fig .",
    "[ fig_sky ] compared to the positions of galaxies classified as likely cluster members by ferguson ( 1989 ) .",
    "our first field is centred on the large galaxy ngc  1399 at the centre of the cluster . in order both to cover a large number of targets and to go significantly deeper than previous spectroscopic surveys we chose to limit our survey at a  magnitude of 19.7 .",
    "this is then essentially the same depth as the large scale 2df galaxy redshift survey ( grs ) of ellis , colless and collaborators ( e.g.  colless 1999 ; folkes et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this combination of survey area and magnitude limit will optimise our measurement of the cluster galaxies ( see section  [ sec_cluster ] ) .",
    ".fornax spectroscopic survey fields [ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the second stage of the identification process we check each identification interactively using the rvsao package to display the best cross - correlation and a plot of the object spectrum with common spectral features plotted at the corresponding redshift . when the redshift is obviously wrong ( e.g.  with the calcium h & k lines clearly present but misidentified ) , it is flagged as being wrong or in some cases is recalculated .",
    "the recaculation most commonly involves repeating the template cross - correlation on a restricted wavelength range chosen to avoid the red end of the spectrum affected by poorly removed sky features . in extreme cases",
    "the object may be a qso : these are distinguished by strong broad emission lines and are measured using a composite qso spectrum ( francis et al.1991 ) .",
    "objects still not identified at this stage are flagged to be reobserved .",
    "a third , supplementary stage is used for any spectra measured with good signal ( a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath610 in each 4.3  wide pixel ) but no obvious features in their 2df spectra : these are flagged as ` strange ' and scheduled for detailed follow - up observations with conventional slit spectrographs .",
    "once the spectroscopic redshift measurements are complete , they are corrected to heliocentric values .",
    "we checked the accuracy of the redshift measurements by comparing the results for 66 objects with repeated measurements .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "scatter of the velocity differences is 90 .",
    "this uncertainty is consistent with the combined error estimates for the same measurements produced by rvsao : the mean predicted error was 92 .",
    "note that this implies a measurement error of a single observation of @xmath7 .",
    "we also compared our results to redshifts of 44 galaxies found in a search of the literature using ned ( most were from hilker et al .",
    "the comparison gave a mean velocity difference of ( @xmath8 )  and an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 111 , entirely consistent with our internal calibration .",
    "the 2df spectra , although of low resolution and unfluxed , are useful for more detailed analysis than simple redshift measurements and object classifications ( c.f .",
    "tresse et al .",
    "we defer any detailed analysis of the spectra to later papers dealing with specific object classes , but note here that , even for the lowest luminosity galaxies , they can be used to measure emission line equivalent widths , and hence star formation rates , line widths ( limited by the resolution of 900 ) , emission line ratios ( e.g.  /  and / ) , absorption line indices ( e.g.  h+/k and /fei4045 ) and even ages and metallicities from these balmer and the metal absorption lines ( paper ii ; folkes et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "although this present paper is mainly concerned with the principles behind the , we already have a considerable amount of 2df data for the project from commissioning observations in 1996/1997 , and scheduled time in december 1997/january 1998 and november 1998 .",
    "we have nearly completed our observations of the first field having observed 92% of all targets in the range @xmath9 to 19.7 and successfully obtained redshifts for 94% of those observed .    for resolved objects ( galaxies )",
    "the success rate of our redshift measurements is a function of surface brightness . in fig .",
    "[ fig05_lim ] we plot the numbers of galaxies observed and identified as a function of central surface brightness .",
    "we have attempted to optimise the exposure times to the surface brightnesses of the objects , using exposures up to 3.75  hours for the lower surface brightness images .",
    "the identification rate runs at 78% or better to a limit of 23 .",
    "fainter than this limit ( corresponding to a mean surface brightness inside the detection threshold @xmath10 ) , the identifications drop off rapidly .",
    "the unresolved objects at higher surface brightness ( mostly stars ) have an identification rate of 95% in our target magnitude range of @xmath9 to 19.7 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig06_spc ] we show example spectra from our initial observations of the various types of object discussed above .",
    "the first two spectra are galactic stars , an m - dwarf and a white dwarf .",
    "the next two spectra are of normal low - redshift galaxies , one with an absorption line spectrum and one with an emission line spectrum .",
    "the remaining four spectra are all of objects that were unresolved ( i.e.  classified as stars in the target catalogues ) , but have been identified as various types of galaxy .",
    "the first is a compact emission line galaxy ( celg ; see section  [ sec_celg ] ) , the second is a normal , optically selected qso and the third is an x - ray source .",
    "the final spectrum is of a fainter radio - loud quasar .",
    "the number of galaxies observed in the fornax cluster itself is not yet large enough to allow a detailed study of the cluster population : this will require results from the remaining three 2df spectrograph fields to achieve the statistical samples needed .",
    "however , we have ample data to delineate clearly the velocity structure in the direction of fornax .",
    "in particular , we have determined accurately the velocity distribution of galactic stars , as well as the galaxy distribution in redshift space behind the cluster .",
    "the radial velocity distribution of galactic stars is revealed in the existing _ fss _ results , despite the modest resolution of the spectra compared to those conventionally used in kinematic surveys of the galaxy .",
    "a total of 2467 objects in field  1 of table  [ tab_fields ] have reliable radial velocities @xmath11 .",
    "the estimated standard errors in the velocities are typically @xmath12 , sufficiently small to reveal the contributions of different galactic components .",
    "figure  [ fig_is_starvels ] shows the distribution of all fss field  1 objects with reliable ( @xmath13 ) velocities less than 750  kms@xmath14 .",
    "the field has galactic co - ordinates @xmath15 , so we are sampling a sight - line looking diagonally ` down ' through the galactic plane between the anti - centre and anti - rotation directions .",
    "the component of the motion of the local standard of rest in this direction is @xmath16  kms@xmath14 . for our chosen magnitude range",
    ", the survey will sample predominantly disc , thick disc and halo main sequence stars , with some contribution from halo giants and disc white dwarfs ( gilmore & reid 1983 ) .",
    "the results can be compared with dedicated spectroscopic studies of faint stars in high - latitude fields ( e.g. kuijken & gilmore 1989 ; croswell et al .",
    "1991 ; majewski 1992 ) .",
    "the contribution of the various galactic components can be demonstrated by considering subsamples of the stars defined by colour .",
    "basic colour information can be derived from the blue and red magnitudes given in the apm catalogue .",
    "figure  [ fig_is_starcols ] shows the distribution of these @xmath17 colours for the field  1 objects with velocities @xmath18  kms@xmath14 .",
    "the form of the distribution is similar to that obtained in dedicated studies of the properties of faint stars ( e.g. reid & majewski 1993 ) .",
    "we divide the stars into three samples : relatively blue stars having @xmath19 ; moderately red stars having @xmath20 ; and very red stars having @xmath21 .",
    "the sharp decline in numbers bluewards of @xmath22 is the result of the main sequence cut - off for moderately old stellar populations ; the blue sample extends to this limit .",
    "these limits at @xmath23 and 1.7 correspond to @xmath24 and 1.1    the moderately red stars are expected to include g and k dwarfs in the thick disc and halo , g and k giants in the halo , and disc k dwarfs .",
    "the halo component , being dynamically pressure supported , has a broad radial velocity distribution which is displaced relative to the solar motion by the component of the solar rotation velocity towards fornax ( freeman 1987 ; gilmore , wyse & kuijken 1987 ; majewski 1993 ) .",
    "disc and thick disc stars , being rotationally supported , have a zero or small asymmetric drift and a modest intrinsic velocity dispersion : their velocity distributions will be centred closer to zero heliocentric velocity . the moderately - red star sample is therefore expected to have a broad velocity distribution with the halo component contributing a high velocity tail , consistent with the velocity distributions shown in figure  [ fig_is_starvelscols ] .",
    "in contrast , the very red star sample will be rich in disc late k and m dwarfs and will include halo late k and m giants .",
    "it is therefore expected to have only a modest net drift with respect to the local standard of rest but with a tail to high velocity , as observed in figure  [ fig_is_starvelscols ] .",
    "the blue stars include local ( disc ) white dwarfs and halo horizontal branch stars .",
    "they are therefore expected to have a broad range of velocities , consistent with the results here .    of particular interest",
    "is the high velocity tail at @xmath25 km s@xmath14 . if the extreme examples are confirmed by higher resolution spectroscopy they will provide useful constraints on the mass of the galaxy ( e.g. carney , latham & laird 1988 ; croswell et al .",
    "1991 ; majewski , munn & hawley 1996 ; freeman 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "a gap is present in the velocity distribution between the cut - off in galactic stars at @xmath26  kms@xmath14 and the fornax cluster at @xmath27 .",
    "no objects are found in this intermediate velocity range among the results from the first 2df field .",
    "the low velocity limit of the cluster velocity distribution is therefore defined without ambiguity .",
    "it is of interest to determine whether there are any galaxies in the foreground to the fornax cluster having heliocentric radial velocities @xmath28 which might be overlooked given the very large number of galactic stars in this velocity range .",
    "the apm catalogue ( used as the input database for the survey ) provides a classification for each image from the blue and red sky survey plates .",
    "of the 2467 objects having @xmath28 and cross - correlation @xmath29  parameter @xmath30 , 14 are classified as being galaxies in both blue and red .",
    "all 14 were inspected visually on the digitised sky survey and again on a supercosmos measuring machine ( miller et al .",
    "1992 ) scan of film or17818 taken on tech pan emulsion with the ukst .",
    "the tech pan data provided higher resolution and greater depth than the digitised sky survey ( e.g. phillipps & parker 1993 ) .",
    "all foreground galaxy candidates appeared to be compact images merged with another , fainter image .",
    "most were unambiguously galactic stars merged with either another star or with a background galaxy .",
    "none of the 14 candidates had the extended appearance expected of a nearby dwarf galaxy .    to extend the search , the visual inspection was repeated on the five images with reliable velocities having the largest apm @xmath31 parameter on the blue sky survey plates .",
    "the @xmath31 parameter measures the degree to which an image differs from a point - spread function and is a convenient indicator of a non - stellar light profile .",
    "of the five images having a blue @xmath32 , none had the appearance expected of a nearby dwarf galaxy : all were found to be compact ( star - like ) images merged with either another star or a faint galaxy .",
    "a third and final search for foreground galaxies was performed using large exponential scale lengths as a indicator of extended images .",
    "the surface photometry described in section  [ ssec_resolvedobjs ] derived a scale length from the low surface brightness regions of each image .",
    "only five images with reliable velocities @xmath33 had scale lengths @xmath34 .",
    "none had the appearance expected of a nearby dwarf galaxy on the digitised sky survey or the scan of the tech pan film : all objects were again found to be merged images .",
    "we conclude that no foreground galaxies were found with star - like velocities .",
    "we therefore have no galaxies with heliocentric in field  1 of table  [ tab_fields ] within our magnitude range . among the brighter galaxies ( @xmath35 ) in the whole cluster region ,",
    "jones & jones ( 1980 ) previously found a small number with such low velocities ( ngc  1375 , ngc  1386 , ngc  1396 ( @xmath36  g75 ) , and ngc  1437a ) , though the exact number depends on the accuracy of their redshift determinations .",
    "a search of the _ nasa extragalactic database _ ( _ ned _ ) identifies the same four galaxies . of these ,",
    "ngc  1375 , ngc  1386 and ngc  1396 lie in our field  1 .",
    "figure  [ fig_is_clusterfss ] shows the velocity distribution of fornax cluster galaxies from the _ fss_. the mean heliocentric radial velocity from the _ fss _ data is @xmath37 ( 26 galaxies ) .",
    "this compares with @xmath38 from jones & jones .",
    "recall that the jones & jones galaxies are much brighter than ours ( roughly @xmath39 as against @xmath40 ) and are spread over a much larger area , 6 degrees or about 1.6  mpc across compared to our 2  degrees or 0.5  mpc .",
    "a velocity dispersion can be estimated fairly unambiguously as there are no galaxies with velocities less than 900 or between 2300 and @xmath41 .",
    "our 26 galaxies give an observed radial velocity dispersion of @xmath42 , compared to the @xmath43 of jones & jones .",
    "the _ fss _ velocity distribution can also be compared with the equivalent distribution compiled from all published redshift data .",
    "figure  [ fig_is_clusterned ] presents the velocity data from _",
    "ned_. these give a mean heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath44 ( 32 galaxies ) , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath45 , entirely consistent with the _ fss _ results .",
    "the _ ned _ results generally , though not entirely , apply to the brighter cluster galaxies .",
    "fornax is an apparently well relaxed , regular cluster as judged by its central density concentration and low spiral content .",
    "it would require a very much larger sample of redshifts over the other fields in order to explore properly any dynamical differences between different galaxy populations .",
    "these initial results do not reveal any difference in the dynamics between the bright and faint ( giant and dwarf ) members of the cluster , although a wide - field study of brighter galaxies ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2000a ) does suggest such a difference .",
    "figure  [ fig_is_backgndfss ] shows our redshift distribution behind the cluster . immediately beyond the cluster , as noted by jones & jones ( 1980 ) and phillipps & davies ( 1992 ) , there is a large void , extending some 40 mpc ( from the cluster mean redshift to about @xmath46 assuming @xmath47 ) . beyond this `` fornax void '' ,",
    "we see the ubiquitous ` spiky ' distribution ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1990 ) showing more distant walls and filaments .",
    "figure  [ fig_is_backgndned ] shows the distribution of background galaxies taken from the _ ned_. the difference in depth between the two data sets is immediately apparent : the results probe to much greater distances on account of the fainter magnitudes of the galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the first two main features in our distribution clearly match the two peaks seen in the _ ned _ data ( i.e. in the brighter galaxies ) .",
    "a standard cone diagram is shown in figure  [ fig_is_conefssra2 ] , illustrating the skeleton of the large scale 3-d structure beyond fornax .",
    "the median redshift of the entire galaxy sample is 0.15 .",
    "this compares with a mean of 0.11 in the preliminary data from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless 1999 ) .",
    "the data continue to map structure out to @xmath48 , where there are still significant numbers of galaxies .",
    "the cluster j1556.15bl identified by couch et al .",
    "( 1991 ) lies in field  1 at @xmath49 , but the density of _ fss _ galaxies at this redshift is too small to show the cluster .",
    "in addition to the general galaxy population , figure  [ fig_is_conefssra2 ] also shows ( as large solid points ) the compact galaxies discussed in paper  ii .",
    "these objects have star - like images on schmidt survey plates but the 2df spectroscopy showed them to be compact star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath50 .",
    "the figure also shows low surface brightness galaxies having intrinsic ( cosmologically corrected ) central surface brightnesses fainter than @xmath51 , plotted as open circles . despite their low surface brightnesses , these objects are sufficiently distant that they are too luminous to be dwarfs given the apparent magnitude limits of the survey ( they have @xmath52 to @xmath53 for @xmath47 ) .    many authors ( e.g. phillipps & shanks 1987 ; eder et al .",
    "1989 ; thuan et al . 1991 ; loveday et al . 1995 ; mo , mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ) have discussed whether or not low luminosity and/or low surface brightness galaxies follow the same structures as the brighter component .",
    "although , as stated earlier , this sample is not yet complete  so we can not use strictly objective measures such as the galaxy correlation function ( phillipps & shanks 1987 )  we do have enough information in our distribution to see that the low surface brightness galaxies ( shown as open circles in figures  [ fig_is_zsb ] and [ fig_is_conefssra2 ] ) do trace the same large scale structure and are not seen `` filling the voids''(dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "the present data extend this comparison of the distribution of lsbg with that of normal galaxies to significantly lower surface brightnesses than most other studies ( or , indeed , will be possible with the standard sloan or grs samples ) . similarly , the compact ( high surface brightness ) galaxies , which are also likely to be missing from other surveys , again follow the same overall large scale structure in figure  [ fig_is_conefssra2 ] as the general galaxy population .",
    "this is unlike the suggestions from some previous emission line galaxy surveys ( e.g. salzer 1989 ) that such objects can appear in very low density regions .",
    "in this paper we have presented an overview of the , the first complete , all - object spectroscopic survey to cover a large area of sky .",
    "this project has only been made possible by the advent of the 400-fibre two - degree field spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope . in total",
    "we hope to observe some 14,000 objects to a magnitude limit of = 19.7  both ` stars ' and ` galaxies '  in a 12  area of sky centred on the fornax cluster .",
    "the main technical challenges of the project concern the preparation of the target catalogue and the analysis of the resulting spectra .",
    "our input catalogues are based on uk schmidt sky survey plates digitised by the apm facility .",
    "we have demonstrated that the apm image catalogues provide sufficiently accurate target positions and photometry for the unresolved sources .",
    "for the resolved sources our photometry is derived by fitting exponential profiles to the image parameters measured by the apm .",
    "we have tested our calibration with new ccd observations .",
    "we use a semi - automated procedure to classify our spectra and measure radial velocities based on cross - correlation comparison with a set of stellar spectra , two emission - line galaxy spectra and one qso spectrum .",
    "this procedure successfully identifies stars , galaxies and qsos completely independently of their image morphology .",
    "when the  is complete we will have a unique , complete , sample of galactic stars , fornax cluster galaxies , field galaxies and distant agn .",
    "we have discussed some of the scientific questions that can be addressed with such a sample .",
    "the principal objective is to obtain an unbiased sample of cluster members , which includes compact galaxies and low surface brightness dwarfs , independent of a membership classification based on morphological appearance .",
    "redshift / velocity distributions are presented here based on spectroscopic results from the first of four 2df fields .",
    "the velocity distribution of galactic stars can be understood in terms of a conventional three - component model of the galaxy . the fornax cluster dwarf galaxies in the first 2df field have a mean heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath37 and a radial velocity dispersion of @xmath42 .",
    "the fornax cluster is well - defined dynamically , with a low density of galaxies in the foreground and immediate background . beyond @xmath54 , the large - scale structure behind the fornax cluster",
    "is clearly delineated out to a redshift @xmath48 .",
    "the compact galaxies found behind the cluster by drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1999a ) are found to follow the structures delineated by the general galaxy population , as are background low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "some more detailed initial results have already been presented elsewhere ( drinkwater et al .  1999a , 1999b ) .",

    "<S> the _ fornax spectroscopic survey _ will use the two degree field spectrograph ( 2df ) of the anglo - australian telescope to obtain spectra for a complete sample of all 14000 objects with @xmath0 in a 12 square degree area centred on the fornax cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the aims of this project include the study of dwarf galaxies in the cluster ( both known low surface brightness objects and putative normal surface brightness dwarfs ) and a comparison sample of background field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we will also measure quasars and other active galaxies , any previously unrecognised compact galaxies and a large sample of galactic stars . by selecting all objects  </S>",
    "<S> both stars and galaxies  independent of morphology , we cover a much larger range of surface brightness and scale size than previous surveys .    in this paper we first describe the design of the survey . </S>",
    "<S> our targets are selected from uk schmidt telescope sky survey plates digitised by the automated plate measuring ( apm ) facility . </S>",
    "<S> we then describe the photometric and astrometric calibration of these data and show that the apm astrometry is accurate enough for use with the 2df . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe a general approach to object identification using cross - correlations which allows us to identify and classify both stellar and galaxy spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> we present results from the first 2df field . </S>",
    "<S> redshift distributions and velocity structures are shown for all observed objects in the direction of fornax , including galactic stars , galaxies in and around the fornax cluster , and for the background galaxy population . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity data for the stars show the contributions from the different galactic components , plus a small tail to high velocities . </S>",
    "<S> we find no galaxies in the foreground to the cluster in our 2df field . </S>",
    "<S> the fornax cluster is clearly defined kinematically . </S>",
    "<S> the mean velocity from the 26 cluster members having reliable redshifts is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> they show a velocity dispersion of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> large - scale structure can be traced behind the cluster to a redshift beyond @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> background compact galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies are found to follow the general galaxy distribution .    </S>",
