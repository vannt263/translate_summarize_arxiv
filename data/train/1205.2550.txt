    "the abrupt cessation of pulsed radio emission for several pulse periods , exhibited by some pulsars , has remained unexplained despite the discovery of this phenomenon in many radio pulsars .",
    "this phenomenon , called pulse nulling , was first discovered in four pulsars in 1970 .",
    "subsequent studies have revealed pulse nulling in about 100 pulsars to date ( backer 1970 ; hesse & wielebinski 1974 ; ritchings 1976 ; biggs 1992 ; vivekanand 1995 ; wang et al .",
    "the degree and form of pulse nulling varies from one pulsar to another . on one hand",
    ", there are pulsars such as psr b0826@xmath034 ( durdin et al . 1979 ) , which null most of the time , and psr b1931 + 24 ( kramer et al . 2006 ) , which exhibits no radio emission for 2 @xmath0 4 weeks .",
    "in contrast , pulsars such as psr b0809 + 74 show a small degree of nulling ( lyne & ashworth 1983 ) .",
    "pulse nulling is frequent in pulsars such as psr b1112 + 50 , while it is very sporadic in psr b1642@xmath003 ( ritchings 1976 ) .",
    "the fraction of pulses with no detectable emission is known as the nulling fraction ( nf ) and is a measure of the degree of nulling in a pulsar .",
    "however , nf does not specify the duration of individual nulls , nor does it specify how the nulls are spaced in time .",
    "although some attempts of characterizing patterns in pulse nulling were made in the previous studies ( backer 1970 ; ritchings 1976 ; janssen & van leeuwen 2004 ; kloumann & rankin 2010 ) , not many pulsars have been studied for systematic patterns in nulling , partly because these require sensitive and long observations .",
    "recent discoveries suggest that nulling pulsars with similar nf may have different null durations .",
    "these include intermittent pulsars , such as psr b1931 + 24 ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ) and psr j1832 + 0029 ( lyne 2009 ) , and the rotating radio transients ( rrats ) , which show no pulsed emission between single burst of emission ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "these pulsars also show extreme degree of nulling similar to few classical nulling pulsars .",
    "psr b1931 + 24 exhibits radio pulsations for 5 to 10 days followed by an absence of pulsations for 25 to 35 days ( kramer et al .",
    "if the cessation of radio emission in this pulsar is interpreted as a null , it has a nf of about @xmath175 percent similar to psr j1502@xmath05653 ( wang et al .",
    "yet the latter shows nulls with a typical duration of few tens of seconds in contrast to a much longer duration for psr b1931 + 24 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn by comparing rrats with classical high nf pulsars .",
    "while this leads to the expectation that pulsars with similar nf may have different nulling timescales , no systematic study of this aspect of nulling is available to the best of our knowledge . in this paper ,",
    "a modest attempt to investigate this is initiated .",
    "pulse nulling was usually believed to be a random phenomenon ( ritchings 1976 ; biggs 1992 ) .",
    "however , recent studies indicate a non - random nulling behaviour for a few classical nulling pulsars ( redman and rankin 2009 ; kloumann and rankin 2010 ) .",
    "redman and rankin ( 2009 ) also report random nulling behaviour for at least 4 out of 18 pulsars in their sample .",
    "therefore , it is not clear if non - randomness in the sense defined in redman and rankin ( 2009 ) is seen in most nulling pulsars and such a study needs to be extended to more nulling pulsars .",
    "this issue is investigated in this paper with a distinct set of nulling pulsars .    in this paper",
    ", we present observations of 15 pulsars , carried out using the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at 325 and 610 mhz . among these",
    ", five were discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pksmb ; manchester et al .",
    "2001 ; morris et al . 2002 ; kramer et al . 2003 ; lorimer et al . 2006 ) , which have no previously reported nulling behaviour .",
    "rest of the sample consists of well known strong nulling pulsars .",
    "the observations and analysis techniques are described in section [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec3 ] , interesting features of the nulling behaviour for a few pulsars",
    "are discussed along with estimates of their nf and the reduction in the pulsed energy during the null phase .",
    "a comparison of the null length and burst length distributions for pulsars , which have similar nf , is presented in section [ sec4 ] and a discussion on the randomness of nulls is presented in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the expected time - scales for the null and burst durations are presented in section [ sec5a ] .",
    "finally , the implications of these results are discussed in section [ sec6 ] and the conclusions are presented in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "this survey of a sample of nulling pulsars was conducted using the gmrt ( swarup et al .",
    "the observations were carried out at 325 and 610 mhz using a total time of 60 hrs from 2008 november 9 to 2009 august 21 . for our observations ,",
    "the gmrt correlator was used as a digital filterbank to obtain 256 spectral channels , each having a bandwidth of 62.5 khz , across the 16 mhz bandpass for each polarization received from the 30 antennas of gmrt .",
    "the digitized signals from typically 14 to 20 gmrt antennas were added in phase ( the gmrt was used as a phased array ) forming a coherent sum of signals with the gmrt array combiner ( gac ) .",
    "then , the summed signals were detected in each channel .",
    "the detected powers in each channel were then acquired into 16-bit registers every 16 @xmath2s after summing the two polarizations in a digital backend and were accumulated before being written to an output buffer to reduce the data volume .",
    "the data were then acquired using a data acquisition card and recorded to a tape for off - line processing .",
    "the effective sampling time for this configuration , used for most of the survey , was 1 msec .    in the off - line processing , the data were first dedispersed and then folded to typically 256 phase bins across the topocentric pulse period using a publicly available package sigproc to obtain an integrated profile for each pulsar .",
    "our sample included six pulsars ( among which five were discovered in pksmb pulsar survey ) with no previously reported low frequency studies .",
    "the integrated profiles for these six pulsars are shown in figure [ profilesfig ] .",
    "these profiles at low radio frequencies are being reported for the first time to the best of our knowledge .",
    "two of these pulsars , psrs j1701@xmath03726 and j1901 + 0413 , exhibit marked scattering tail in their profiles at 610 mhz , while scattering tails are also apparent in two other pulsars , psrs j1639@xmath04359 and j1715@xmath04034 , although not as prominent as in the case of the former two pulsars .",
    "the dedispersed data were then folded to typically 256 phase bins across the topocentric pulse period for each period to form a single pulse sequence . for few pulsars with low intensity single pulses , a fixed number ,",
    "n , of successive pulses ( indicated within parentheses in column 10 of table [ results ] ) in the single pulse data were averaged to form average pulse for every block of n single pulses ( hereafter called subintegration ) , to obtain sufficient signal to noise ratio ( i.e. s / n @xmath3 5 for each subintegration ) .",
    "pulses affected by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , were removed before the nf analysis .",
    "the nf for each pulsar was then obtained using a procedure similar to that used for detecting pulse nulling in single pulse sequences ( ritchings 1976 ; vivekanand 1995 ) .",
    "a baseline , estimated using bins away from the on - pulse bins , was subtracted from the data for each pulse .",
    "the total energy for each pulse in the on - pulse window and the off - pulse window ( both with equal number of bins ) was calculated from the baseline subtracted data .",
    "the energies thus obtained as a function of period number form an on - pulse energy ( onpe ) sequence and off - pulse energy ( ofpe ) sequence .",
    "next , the onpe and ofpe were scaled by the average on - pulse energy , calculated for every block of 200 periods from onpe , to compensate for variations due to inter - stellar scintillations . the normalized onpe and ofpe",
    "were then binned to an appropriate number of energy bins depending upon the available s / n for a given pulsar .",
    "the fraction of total pulses per energy bin was plotted as a histogram as shown in figure [ histogram ] .",
    "an excess at zero energy in the on - pulse energy distribution indicates the fraction of nulled pulses or nf of the pulsar .",
    "this can be estimated by removing a scaled version of off - pulse energy distribution ( modeled as a gaussian ) at zero energy from the on - pulse distribution . as the null and burst pulse distributions are not well separated for most of our pulsars , such a fit of the off - pulse energy distribution , modeled as a gaussian , will have a corresponding error while scaling the on - pulse energy distribution near the zero pulse energy .",
    "this is reflected in the quoted errors on the nfs given in the parentheses in column 6 of table [ results ] .",
    "three pulsars in our sample were weak .",
    "hence , consecutive pulses were added ( indicated inside parentheses of column 10 in table [ results ] ) to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "nf for these three pulsars , obtained using the above mentioned method on data averaged over given number of consecutive periods ( subintegration ) , will be an under estimate .",
    "hence , only the lower limits on the nfs for these pulsars are presented in table [ results ] .",
    "only upper limits on the nfs could be estimated for three pulsars in the sample .",
    "two of these were weak pulsars with significantly low nulling .",
    "estimation of the lower limits on the nfs ( as explained in the previous paragraph ) was not possible as averaging over consecutive periods resulted in detection of emission for every subintegration giving a nf of zero .",
    "however , some of the single pulses in a subintegration may well have been nulled pulses . to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of such pulses for these two pulsars",
    ", we arranged all the single pulses in the ascending order of their on - pulse energy .",
    "a threshold was moved from high to low on - pulse energy end till the pulses below the threshold did not show a collective profile with a pulse at significance greater than 3 times the root mean square deviation ( rms ) .",
    "all the pulses below such threshold were tagged as null pulses .",
    "the fraction of these pulses give an estimate for the upper limit on the nf and this limit is presented for these two pulsars in column 6 of table [ results ] .",
    "the reason for the upper limit on the nf for the remaining pulsar , psr j1725@xmath04043 , is explained in section [ sec3 ] .    the degree , @xmath4 , by which the radio emission from a nulling pulsar declines during the nulls can be obtained by forming the average profiles of the pulsar for burst and null pulses separately .",
    "a threshold energy , decided by examining the on - pulse and off - pulse energy distributions of the pulsar , was used to separate burst and null pulses as shown in figure [ histogram ] .",
    "if the distribution of burst and null pulses are not well separated , such a threshold will cause few low energy burst pulses to be tagged as null pulses and vice - verse . to identify these low energy burst pulses among null pulses , we arranged all null pulses in ascending order of their on - pulse energy .",
    "pulses were removed manually from the high energy end till the null pulse profile , averaged over the remaining null pulses , did not show any profile component with more than 3 times the rms .",
    "these pulses , from the high energy end , were tagged as burst pulses . similarly , burst pulses were also arranged in ascending order of their on - pulse energy .",
    "pulses from the lower end of the on - pulse energy , which did not form an average pulse profile with a significant pulse ( @xmath3 3 times the rms ) , were also removed and tagged as null pulses .",
    "we calculated @xmath4 for a pulsar in a manner similar to that described in vivekanand & joshi ( 1997 ) .",
    "first , the total energy in the on - pulse bins for the burst pulse profile was obtained .",
    "then , an upper limit , estimated as three times the rms , was obtained on the detectable emission in the null pulse profile .",
    "the ratio between these two quantities is defined as @xmath4 ( equation [ r ] ) .",
    "@xmath5    where + p@xmath6 = intensity in i@xmath7 bin for the on - pulse window of the burst pulse profile + rms@xmath8 = rms estimated over the on - pulse window of the null pulse profile + n = number of bins in the on - pulse window + the errors given in the parentheses in column 8 were estimated as 3 times the off - pulse rms in the burst pulse profile .",
    "we are reporting @xmath4 for 11 pulsars in our sample for the first time .",
    "the results of our analysis for the sample of pulsars in this study are presented in table [ results ] .",
    "the table presents some of the basic parameters for the observed pulsars ( i.e. column 3 : period , column 4 : dm and column 5 : flux density at 1420 mhz ) .",
    "it also presents nfs with the corresponding error in the parentheses ( i.e. column 6 ) for all the pulsars of our sample .",
    "the previously reported nfs ( i.e. column 7 ) for some pulsars are also listed for comparison and our results are consistent with those reported earlier for these pulsars .",
    "nfs are being reported for the first time in five pulsars , which were discovered in pksmb survey . for 11 pulsars in our sample , estimates for @xmath4 are reported for the first time ( i.e. column 8) .    to investigate the time scales of the null and the burst phase ( i.e. normal emission ) ,",
    "the single pulse sequences for eight pulsars were examined .",
    "these pulsars show high s / n ( i.e. @xmath3 5 ) for single burst pulses .",
    "hence , null and burst pulses can be separated easily using the above mentioned method .",
    "the null lengths and burst lengths as well as the total number of uninterrupted sequences of null and burst phases were obtained from this examination of data . the null length histogram ( nlh ) and burst length histogram ( blh ) for these eight pulsars ,",
    "are shown in figure [ nbhistall ] .",
    "[ j1738sp ]    [ results ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the estimates for the factor , @xmath4 , by which the pulsed emission reduces during the nulls for 11 pulsars were presented for the first time in this paper ( table 1 ) .",
    "although the physical process , which causes nulling , is not yet understood , it could be due to a loss of coherence in the plasma generating the radio emission or due to geometric reasons . in the former case",
    ", @xmath4 provides a constraint on the process responsible for this loss of coherence .",
    "our estimates provide lower limits for different pulsars as this estimate is limited by the available s / n .",
    "nevertheless , reduction by two orders of magnitude is seen in at least two pulsars .",
    "if nulling is caused by a shift in the radio beam due to global changes in magnetosphere , @xmath4 provides a constraint on the low level emission and will depend on the orientation to the line of sight and the morphology of the beam during the null .",
    "our results confirm that nf probably does not capture the full detail of the nulling behaviour of a pulsar .",
    "we find that the pattern of nulling can be quite different for classical nulling pulsars with similar nfs .",
    "estimates for typical timescales , @xmath9 , for 6 pulsars in our sample were obtained for the first time . for 2 of these with a nf of about 1 percent ,",
    "@xmath9 varies by a factor of three .",
    "in particular , the typical nulling timescale for psr b1112 + 50 ( nf @xmath1 65% ) is about 2 s , more than 6 orders of magnitude less than that for the intermittent pulsar psr b1931 + 24 ( nf @xmath1 75% ) . in the ruderman and sutherland ( 1975 ) model , the pulsar emission is related to relativistic pair plasma generated due to high accelerating electric potential in the polar cap .",
    "changes in this relativistic plasma flow ( filippenko & radhakrishna 1982 ; lyne et al .",
    "2010 ) , probably caused by changes in the polar cap potential , have been proposed as the underlying cause for a cessation of emission during a null .",
    "the typical nulling timescale , @xmath9 ( and burst timescale @xmath10 ) provides a characteristic duration for such a quasi - stable state , which is similar to a profile mode - change .",
    "an interesting possibility may be to relate this to the polar cap potential . in any case , any plausible model for nulling needs to account for the range of null durations for pulsars in our sample and relate it to a physical parameter and/or magnetospheric conditions in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we have extended the wald - wolfowitz runs test for randomness to 8 more pulsars .",
    "results for 15 pulsars were published in previous studies ( redman and rankin 2009 ; kloumann and rankin 2010 ) .",
    "our sample has no overlap with the sample presented by these authors .",
    "like these authors , we find that this test indicates that occurrence of nulling , when individual pulses are considered , is non - random or exhibits correlation across periods . unlike these authors , all 8 pulsars in our sample show such a behaviour .",
    "this correlation groups pulses in null and burst states , which was also noted by redman and rankin ( 2009 ) . however , the duration of the null and burst states seems to be modeled by a stochastic poisson point process suggesting that these transitions occur at random .",
    "thus , the underlying physical process for nulls in the 8 pulsars , studied in this paper , appears to be random in nature producing nulls and bursts with unpredictable durations .",
    "lastly , our estimates of nf in table 1 are consistent with those published earlier for psrs b0809 + 74 , b0818@xmath013 , b0835@xmath041 , b1112 + 50 and b2319 + 60 ( lyne & ashworth 1986 ; biggs 1992 ; ritchings 1976 ) , which indicates that nf are consistent over a time scale of about 30 years .",
    "the nulling behaviour of 15 pulsars , out of which 5 were pksmb pulsars with no previously reported nulling behavior , is presented in this paper with estimates of their nfs . for four of these 15 pulsars ,",
    "only an upper / lower limit was previously reported .",
    "the estimates of reduction in the pulsed emission is also presented for the first time in 11 pulsars .",
    "nf value for individual profile component is also presented for two pulsars in the sample , namely psrs b2111 + 46 and b2020 + 28 .",
    "possible mode changing behaviour is suggested by these observations for psr j1725@xmath04043 , but this needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations .",
    "an interesting quasi - periodic nulling behaviour for psr j1738@xmath02330 is also reported .",
    "we find that the nulling patterns differ between psrs b0809 + 74 , b0818@xmath013 , b0835@xmath041 and b2021 + 51 , even though they have similar nf of around 1% .",
    "the null and burst pulses in 8 pulsars in our sample appear to be grouped and seem to occur in a correlated way , when individual periods are considered .",
    "however , the interval between transitions from the null to the burst states ( and vice - verse ) appears to represent a poisson point process .",
    "the typical null and burst timescales for these pulsars have been obtained for the first time to the best of our knowledge .",
    "pulsar nulling remains an open question even after 40 years since it was first reported .",
    "recent studies suggests that both nulling and profile mode changes probably represent a global reorganization of pulsar magnetosphere probably accompanied by changes in the spin - down rate of these pulsars ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ; lyne et al .",
    "interestingly , such quasi - stable states of magnetosphere have recently been proposed , based on mhd calculations , to explain the release of magnetic energy implied by high energy bursts in soft - gamma ray repeaters ( contopoulos , kazanas & fendt 1999 ; contopoulos 2005 ; timokhin 2010 ) .",
    "global changes in magnetospheric state is likely to be manifested in changes in radio emission regardless of the frequency of observations .",
    "future simultaneous multifrequency observations of pulsars with nulling will be useful to study these changes and constrain such magnetospheric models .",
