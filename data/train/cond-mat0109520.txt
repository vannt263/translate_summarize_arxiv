    "electronic transport through mesoscopic structures with system size @xmath4 smaller than the electron phase relaxation length @xmath5 has become a unique `` playground '' to study quantum interference effects.@xcite an intriguing phenomenon which convincingly presents the essence of quantum interference in diffusive electronic transport are the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) .",
    "their size is of the order of @xmath6 , independent of sample geometry or the details of the realization of disorder , provided that the electronic system stays in the diffusive transport regime .",
    "ucf were first considered in a diagrammatic approach,@xcite and then soon discussed within random - matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite which imry@xcite had proposed to apply for this class of problems . ucf were observed as magneto - finger - prints in mesoscopic wires ( see the measurement of conductance fluctuations in gold wires by washburn and webb@xcite ) .",
    "the superconducting analogue of ucf in normal conducting wires are supercurrent fluctuations in chaotic sns - josephson point contacts , as put forward by beenakker.@xcite the sample - to - sample fluctuations of the critical current @xmath7 depend only on the gap in the single particle spectrum : @xmath8 with a numerical coefficient @xmath9 of order unity . here , @xmath10 is the bulk gap , and the junction extension is assumed to be small compared to the coherence length . again , the fluctuations are universal in the sense that they do not depend on junction parameters like , for example , the degree of disorder or the junction geometry",
    ". these universal supercurrent fluctuations still have to be verified experimentally .",
    "the realization depends on several conditions .",
    "first of all , the dynamics of the junction should be chaotic either due to impurities or boundary scattering .",
    "for example , for a diffusive junction , the junction length @xmath4 ( which is to be taken as the separation of sn interfaces ) has to be much larger than the mean free path @xmath11 in the normal - conducting part of the junction , @xmath12 . secondly , to ensure universality , the superconducting energy has to be the only low energy scale .",
    "this amounts to the criterion that the thouless energy @xmath13 is much larger than the maximum gap in the energy spectrum , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mean dwell time of electrons or holes in the junction . for a diffusive junction",
    ", this condition of a short dwell - time is fulfilled if @xmath4 is much smaller than the coherence length , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the diffusive coherence length , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the fermi velocity .",
    "moreover , the number @xmath20 of transverse modes at the fermi level which propagate through the junction , has to be large to allow an expansion in the `` dimensionless inverse conductance '' @xmath21 and thus to prove that the numerical coefficient @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ rms ] ) is indeed independent of @xmath20.@xcite    physically , ( a ) multiple andreev reflection at the interfaces,@xcite and ( b ) the statistics of the transmission eigenvalues lead to the universal fluctuations , eq .",
    "( [ rms ] ) .",
    "thereby , ( a ) is reponsible for the formation of current carrying bound ( andreev- ) states in the junction . in the short dwell - time regime , only one andreev state per channel exists . as a consequence ,",
    "the supercurrent @xmath22 is a linear statistic@xcite on the normal - region transmission coefficients @xmath23 @xmath24 , independent of all junction parameters .",
    "however , the critical current @xmath25 is in general not a linear statistic on @xmath23 since the phase @xmath26 at which the supercurrent is maximal depends on all the transmission coefficients .",
    "beenakker showed that @xmath27 approximately obeys a linear statistic to within a correction of order @xmath28 , where @xmath20 is the number of channels . from the statistical properties of the transmission eigenvalues",
    "@xmath23 it is known that the fluctuations of a linear statistic are of order unity and thus are universal , eq .  ( [ rms ] ) .    in this work",
    "we consider a josephson junction where a chaotic quantum dot is strongly coupled to two superconductors .",
    "it is known that the scattering matrix of the normal conducting dot in this case belongs to the `` circular unitary ensemble '' ( cue ) of rmt.@xcite the case of a weakly coupled junction was considered elsewhere.@xcite we are especially interested in the fluctuations of the supercurrent if the number of conducting channels in the normal chaotic region , @xmath20 , is small .",
    "this implies that the critical current does not obey a linear statistic .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the sample - to - sample fluctuations are still determined by the relation eq .",
    "( [ rms ] ) .",
    "however , the prefactor @xmath9 will now be weakly dependent on the number of channels @xmath20 .",
    "more relevant is the question of how the full distribution of critical currents , @xmath0 , will behave when we transit from a situation with no level repulsion ( @xmath2 ) to the scenarios with level repulsion ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "certainly , the two situations differ qualitatively .",
    "for @xmath1 the distribution is a gaussian.@xcite for a single - channel junction , the literature does not provide a numerical or analytical result , to our knowledge .",
    "the missing level repulsion will move the center of the distribution to a lower value of @xmath7 , the details of which should depend on the chosen ensemble .",
    "finally , the case of a small number of channels is intriguing because it will interpolate between these two qualitatively incompatible situations  no level repulsion versus repulsion between many levels .",
    "although a josephson junction with these properties has not yet been realized , neither for a small nor for a large number of channels , the microfabrication of point contacts with a small number of channels is already feasible ( for example , see refs .  ) ; and findings like the conductance quantization , related to the friedel sum rule,@xcite open new possibilities for the research of correlation effects in nano - scale structures .",
    "chaotic point contacts are now within reach of experiments .",
    "the investigation of the interference of diffusion and coulomb interaction should soon be possible , and we expect new exciting physics to emerge in these systems .",
    "in the recent 15 years , rmt has become a tool with which electronic transport through disordered mesoscopic systems can be studied very efficiently .",
    "it builds on the statistical independence of the elements of , e.g. the scattering matrix and directly implements the symmetry of this matrix . as an excellent review by beenakker@xcite on this topic is available",
    ", we will only motivate some of the basic results in this section .",
    "we are going to apply rmt to the normal region of the sns contact . the model which we use for the sns contact",
    "was suggested in ref .  .",
    "however , we will extend the previous considerations to heterogeneous contacts .",
    "the critical current through an sns - junction is determined by a specific realization of a random potential in the normal region which is the origin of the mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "interaction effects between the electrons in the normal metal are not taken into account , neither is spin - orbit coupling .    concerning the interface between the superconducting and the normal regions ,",
    "two scenarios have to be distinguished : the case of weak coupling , realized for instance by tunneling barriers@xcite and the case of strong coupling with ideal , impurity - free leads at @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sns ] ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath31 is a unitary random matrix with eigenvalues uniformly distributed on the complex unit circle,@xcite and the corresponding ensemble is referred to as cue . in this article",
    "we will consider only the circular ensemble , that is , we stay in the strong coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , we assume the thouless energy to be much larger than the gap , @xmath32 . in this limit , which was named `` short dwell - time regime '' in ref .  , the energy dependence of the scattering matrix can be neglected .    on the other hand , the dwell - time @xmath15 of electrons and holes in the chaotic region  with energies close to the fermi level  has to be sufficiently large so that rmt is applicable .",
    "the dwell - time @xmath15 should be larger than the time scale @xmath33 at which ergodicity sets in , where @xmath34 .    ) and holes ( @xmath35).,width=460,height=192 ]    the scattering matrix @xmath31 has the block structure @xmath36 with the reflection matrices @xmath37 and the transmission matrices @xmath38 , all of which are @xmath39 matrices .",
    "the number of propagating modes in each of the two leads is @xmath20 .",
    "current conservation implies that the scattering matrix is unitary : @xmath40 , and a `` polar decomposition '' is possible:@xcite @xmath41 where a @xmath39 diagonal matrix @xmath42 diag(@xmath43 ) has been introduced .",
    "the transmission eigenvalues @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of the matrix product @xmath44 .",
    "the four unitary @xmath39 matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 are to be interpreted as `` phase factors '' . in the case of time - reversal symmetry",
    "the scattering matrix is unitary and symmetric , @xmath47 , which implies that also @xmath48 and @xmath49 hold ( `` circular orthogonal ensemble '' ( coe ) ) .    for statistical averaging",
    "we need the haar measure @xmath50 which can be determined for the above polar decomposition as@xcite @xmath51 the jacobian is the probability distribution @xmath52 of the transmission eigenvalues ( up to a normalization constant @xmath53 ) ; it is given by @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the ensemble parameter  which numbers the degrees of freedom of the matrix elements of @xmath31 : @xmath56 for the two cases considered in this paper .",
    "the set of independent unitary matrices in the haar measure ( [ haarmeasure ] ) is @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for @xmath60 . for the purpose of interpreting the probability distribution ( [ tprob ] )",
    "it has become popular to write it in the form of a gibbs distribution @xmath61 with the `` one - particle '' potential @xmath62 and a `` two - particle '' logarithmic repulsion .",
    "here we follow the approach pioneered by beenakker,@xcite and extend it in order to include the case of heterogeneous junctions.@xcite the details of how to set up the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation for this type of junction are found in the cited paper and in ref .  , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the s - matrix of the complete junction , @xmath63 , connects in- with out - going amplitudes of the electronic wave function in the superconductors .",
    "the components of the wave function are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : sns ] ; for example , we have for the outgoing amplitudes @xmath20 components @xmath64 for electron - like quasi - particles running from the interface @xmath29 to the left and @xmath20 components @xmath65 for electron - like quasiparticles running from the interface @xmath30 to the right .",
    "andreev reflection mixes particle with hole components , and therefore the corresponding hole - like quasiparticles with @xmath20 components @xmath66 and @xmath67 have to be included in the scattering process .",
    "the @xmath68-matrix @xmath63 is now defined through @xmath69 the matrix @xmath63 is actually constructed from more basic @xmath68 s - matrices , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the matrix @xmath70 is formed by the scattering matrices for electrons and holes in the normal , disordered region : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the energy relative to the fermi energy .",
    "the matrix @xmath71 , defined by @xmath74 is the scattering matrix for andreev reflections at both ns interfaces .",
    "the off - diagonal structure originates in the fact that andreev reflection transforms an electron into a hole .",
    "the transformation is supplemented by two phase shifts : one from the penetration of the wave function into the superconductors @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the @xmath39 unit matrix , and @xmath77 the @xmath78 are the respective bogoliubov quasiparticle energy gaps of the two superconductors .",
    "we use rigid boundary conditions with step - like gaps at the sn - interfaces .",
    "this is approximately valid for the considered case that the extension of the junction is much smaller than the coherence length in the bulk superconductor.@xcite the second contribution to the phase shift in ( [ matrixandreev ] ) is the phase @xmath79 acquired from the pair potential in the superconductors which has the matrix form @xmath80 with these basic elements the scattering matrix for multiple andreev reflection at the interfaces , in combination with the intermediate propagation through the disordered region , takes the form@xcite @xmath81 \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\mathbf{1}_{4n } - \\mathbf{s}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{a}}}(e ) \\mathbf{s}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{n}}}(e ) ] ^{-1 } \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc}e^{-i(\\mathbf{\\varphi}-\\mathbf{\\phi})/2 } & 0 \\\\   0 & e^{-i(\\mathbf{\\varphi}+\\mathbf{\\phi})/2 } \\end{array } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 unit matrix .",
    "obviously , the @xmath84 defined in ( [ phasephi ] ) are real for @xmath85 . in this case",
    ", the matrix @xmath71 is unitary : andreev reflection within the region between the two interfaces is current conserving . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath71 is hermitian , and only then is @xmath63 a unitary matrix .      corresponding to the range of energies at which we consider the electron propagation through the junction , we encounter three different regimes :    1 .",
    "@xmath87 , in which case we consider a contiuum of particle and hole scattering states in each superconductor , 2 .",
    "@xmath88 , which is the intermediate regime with quasiparticle states extending over the superconductor with the lower energy gap but they decay exponentially in the superconductor with the larger gap , 3 .",
    "@xmath89 , in which case the bdg wave functions decay exponentially in both superconductors .",
    "bound states , _ andreev states _ , which are localized in the normal region , generate a discrete spectrum . for a finite phase difference , @xmath90 , andreev states support an electrical current .",
    "thereby , the coherent particle - hole excitations in the junction are converted into a supercurrent in the bulk superconductors .      in order to obtain the spectrum in this regime ,",
    "one makes use of the `` wigner time - delay matrix''@xcite @xmath91 , the trace of which is the density of states , @xmath92 : @xmath93 as the scattering matrix of the junction @xmath63 is unitary , one may evaluate the relation ( [ wignerdensity ] ) with @xmath94 and find , respecting the hermiticity of @xmath95 , @xmath96 with @xmath97 a complex function defined through @xmath98 the additive term @xmath99 in the density of states ( [ dos ] ) is independent of the phase difference @xmath100 of the two superconductors and will not contribute to the josephson current .",
    "the determination of the density of states in this energy regime does not proceed parallel to that of @xmath92 with extended quasiparticle states in both superconductors .",
    "the scattering matrix of the junction is not unitary for @xmath101 since the quasiparticle states decay exponentially in the superconductor with the larger energy gap  we assume this to be the left superconductor in fig .  [ fig : sns ] .",
    "however , we can define a reduced scattering matrix @xmath102 which connects only the incoming amplitudes from the right superconductor to the outgoing amplitudes of the right superconductor @xmath103 and the dimension of this scattering matrix is half that of @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath102 is unitary , we may use relation ( [ wignerdensity ] ) for @xmath104 .",
    "after some tedious algebra we arrive again at @xmath105 with a @xmath100-independent additive term @xmath106 @xmath107 as already indicated , the scattering matrix for andreev scattering @xmath95 in @xmath97 is hermitian for the continuum states but not so for the intermediate states , and expressions ( [ dos ] ) and ( [ dos - int ] ) are indeed quite distinct .",
    "since the andreev states are evanescent in the superconductors , the matrix @xmath95 is now unitary .",
    "it obeys the simple relation for bound states @xmath108 solutions exist if @xmath109 is fulfilled . in this regime",
    "the density of states can therefore be written as @xmath110      the stationary current @xmath111 through a sns - junction is driven by the phase difference of the superconductors .",

    "quantum transport of coherent particle - hole excitations through a single channel is rather particular .",
    "level repulsion is missing by construction .",
    "the transmission eigenvalues @xmath118 are distributed according to a `` single - particle '' potential which is either logarithmically diverging for small @xmath118 ( @xmath60 ) or constant ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath119 .",
    "this potential will control the distribution of the critical currents .",
    "it should be realized that this scenario applies also for junction geometries where ( many ) different channels are uncoupled .",
    "it is quite instructive to derive step by step the spectral current for this single channel case since the procedure conveys an understanding of the validity and consequences of the approximations made .",
    "here we present the result for the case of a scattering matrix which is energy independent , that is , the thouless energy is much larger than @xmath120 , and there are no resonances at or in the gap .",

    "moreover , the variance of the supercurrent can be calculated analytically .",
    "however we want to focus on a different issue : the critical current , that is , the maximum supercurrent is usually more accessible in experiments . in the single - channel case",
    "the structure of the supercurrent - phase relation ( [ onechannelcurrent ] ) is actually so elementary for zero temperature that it is possible to determine directly the distribution function for the critical current .",
