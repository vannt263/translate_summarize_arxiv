    "forbidden fine - structure lines of neutral atomic carbon can be used as tracers of the molecular mass in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the ground electronic state of neutral carbon , @xmath3 , is split into five fine - structure levels that , in spectroscopic notation , are denoted by @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 and 2 ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the excited fine levels @xmath8 and @xmath9 lie only 23.6 and 62.4 k above the ground state ( @xmath10 ) and are therefore easily populated by particle collisions in the cold interstellar medium .",
    "two magnetic - dipole transitions are allowed between the fine - structure levels : @xmath11 ( which we refer to as ci  10 ) has a rest frequency of 492.1607 ghz , while @xmath12 ( ci  21 ) produces electromagnetic radiation at 809.3435 ghz .    early one - dimensional models of photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) confined the presence of ci  to a thin transition layer separating the outer ionized zone from the co - rich inner volume @xcite .",
    "however , large - scale ci  surveys of the orion a and b molecular clouds @xcite and of the galactic center @xcite as well as observations of nearby galaxies @xcite have found that the ci  10 , 21 line emission is fully concomitant and strongly correlates with @xmath13 intensity .",
    "in addition , several observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that ci  is ubiquitous in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "clumpy pdr models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the surface layers of ci  are evenly spread across gmcs",
    ". moreover turbulent diffusion , cosmic ray fluxes , and non - equilibrium chemistry all help to maintain a nearly constant @xmath14/[\\rm h_2]$ ] abundance ratio throughout most of the mass of a typical molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "a recent numerical simulation of a turbulent molecular cloud confirms that ci  emission should be widespread in gmcs , with most of the neutral carbon at gas densities between @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 and kinetic temperatures of @xmath18 30 k @xcite .",
    "sensitivity limitations and the low atmospheric trasmissivity in the short sub - mm regime made the detection and imaging of ci  lines in the local universe difficult ( hampering the realization that they do not conform to the standard stratified pdr picture ) . at redshifts @xmath19 , where the ci  lines are redshifted into more favourable atmospheric windows , only a handful of galaxies have been observed in the 10 and 21 transitions ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , this sample will undoubtedly grow in size due to forthcoming observations from the plateau de bure interferometer ( possibly upgraded to the northern extended millimeter array ) , the submillimeter array , the atacama pathfinder experiment and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , as well as with the advent of new facilities such as and the cerro chajnantor atacama telescope .",
    "the improved sensitivity of these instruments will yield observations that significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular gas content of distant galaxies and of the history of cosmic star formation .    in this letter",
    ", we use a fully cosmological simulation of the formation of a massive , high - redshift galaxy and track its non - equilibrium h@xmath0 abundance across cosmic time . using this simulation ,",
    "we produce mock alma maps of the associated ci  1 - 0 and ci  2 - 1 fine - structure line emission , and demonstrate that such observations can be used to robustly estimate the molecular content of massive systems at high redshifts .",
    "the simulation follows the formation of a massive galaxy up to @xmath20 in its full cosmological context using the adaptive - mesh - refinement code @xcite .",
    "it achieves a physical resolution @xmath21 pc , and includes gas cooling , star formation , feedback and metal enrichment from stellar evolution .",
    "we use a novel sub - grid treatment of the formation and destruction of molecular hydrogen within unresolved gmcs to track the non - equilibrium abundance of h@xmath0 . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath22 m@xmath23 , a star - formation rate of 43 m@xmath23 yr@xmath24 and an h@xmath0 mass of @xmath25 m@xmath23 , which are consistent with the properties of sub - mm galaxies for which ci  emission has been already detected at @xmath26 .",
    "this simulation is described in full detail in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details .",

    "we compute the integration time by requiring the brightest pixel in the ( continuum subtracted ) surface - brightness map to have a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of 5 . for our fiducial values of the kinetic temperature and carbon abundance ,",
    "approximately 4 min of exposure is enough to detect the 21 line , whereas 8 min are needed for the 10 line .",
    "these values scale as @xmath54/[\\rm   h_2])^{-2}\\,q_{\\rm u}^{-2}$ ] , suggesting that 76 ( 34 ) min of integration is necessary for an abundance ratio of @xmath55 for the 10 ( 21 ) line .",
    "note that for high values of the gas temperature , the 21 line is brighter than the 10 line .",
    "however , it may be difficult to detect for @xmath56 k as the @xmath9 level may not be significantly populated .",

    ", this gives @xmath62 m@xmath23 and @xmath63 m@xmath23 for the 10 and 21 transitions , respectively .",
    "in practice the kinetic temperature can be determined using the line - intensity ratio ci  21/ci  10 under the assumption of lte ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one can use also the non - lte @xmath64 ) expressions ( papadopoulos et al . 2004 ) , given certain constraints on the average gas density exist ( e.g. via multi-@xmath65 co and hcn line observations ) .",
    "however , the relative ci  abundance must be calibrated against multiple observations of other emission lines as well as measures of the dynamical mass in gmcs ( e.g. from co ) .",
    "observational noise together with uncertainties in @xmath51 and @xmath14/[\\rm h_2]$ ] will , of course , generate scatter around our ideal results .",
    "the spectrum extracted from the data cube at the location of the brightest pixel can be used to obtain @xmath53 and the dynamical mass of the galaxy . over the redshift range @xmath66 , we find that dynamical masses , estimated as @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 is the gravitational constant , @xmath69 the beam radius , and @xmath70 ; @xcite ) , are within a factor of two of the _ total _ mass within a spherical aperture of radius @xmath71 centred on the galaxy .",

    "our simulation includes a sophisticated algorithm to track the non - equilibrium abundance of molecular hydrogen , accounting for its creation on dust grains and destruction by the lyman - werner photons emitted by young stars .    assuming that ci  is well - mixed with h@xmath0 ,",
    "as suggested by recent theoretical models and observations , an abundance ratio of @xmath14/[\\rm h_2]=3\\times10^{-5}$ ] and a gas temperature @xmath51 = 30 k , we find that alma , in its most compact configuration ( @xmath105 m ) , should be able to detect our @xmath20 galaxy in only a few minutes of integration time .",
    "in addition , an integration time of 1 hr will be sufficient to detect the ci  emission coming from galaxies similar to ours at redshifts @xmath103 . at higher @xmath35 ,",
    "longer integrations are required to detect the bulk of the molecular content of our galaxy .",
    "for example , for the 10 line , an integration time of @xmath106 h can recover 96 per cent of the molecular mass that , at @xmath107 , lies within 10 kpc of the centre of the galaxy .",
    "higher - resolution observations ( with @xmath108 m and @xmath109 h ) can be used to map a significant fraction ( 80 - 90 per cent ) of the underlying h@xmath0 mass at redshifts as high as @xmath110 and the densest molecular regions ( which contain nearly 50 per cent of the h@xmath0 mass ) up to @xmath111 .",
    "the fine - structure ci   lines can therefore be used as a reliable tracer of molecular hydrogen in massive galaxies at high - redshift .    using the ci  fine - structure lines as tracers of the h@xmath0 distribution",
    "has several advantages over traditional studies employing rotational transitions of carbon monoxide .",
    "first , the ci  lines have a strong positive _ k_-correction with respect to the low-@xmath65 co transitions but similar excitation characteristics allowing them to probe the bulk of the h@xmath0 mass @xcite . on the other hand , the two high-@xmath65 co lines with similar frequencies to the ci  lines ( co @xmath65=43 , 76 ) , while often bright in star - forming galaxies , trace _ only _ the dense and warm h@xmath0 gas in star - forming regions . observations of these emission lines therefore enclose much more compact regions of a galaxy and do not reliably sample the entire h@xmath0 gas distribution .",
    "recent alma observations have detected cii  emission in a gaseous starbursting disk at @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "its emission , while much brighter than ci , is not tied to the h@xmath0 gas alone but also to the hi  and hii  distributions , which are currently not well constrained in high - redshift galaxies ( and will remain so until the completion of the square kilometre array ) . in addition , at @xmath113 , when the cosmic star - formation rate peaks , cii  can not be detected from the ground and observations at lower redshift are challenging even with alma .",
    "we note that high - fidelity , phase - stable imaging of gas - rich disks at high redshift is necessary for tasks such as determining dynamical masses . the two lower - frequency ci  lines therefore carry several advantages when used as to estimate the h@xmath0 content and the dynamical - masses of galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "furthermore , when combined with transitions that trace only dense star - forming gas ( e.g. co 43 , hcn 10 ) , they also provide a powerful probe of the star - formation mode ( isolated disk versus merger - driven ) in the universe @xcite .",
    "we conclude that using the two ci  lines ( rather than low-@xmath65 co lines ) opens up a much larger fraction of cosmic look - back time over which the h@xmath0 gas mass distribution , the dynamical masses , and the tully - fisher relation of galaxies can be accurately measured .",
