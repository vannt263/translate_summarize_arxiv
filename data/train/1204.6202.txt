    "graphene is a remarkable material due to its unusual conic electron energy spectrum .",
    "one of the important consequences of the spectrum singularity is zero effective mass of electrons near the conic point that results in a high mobility of charge carriers in graphene .",
    "just this fact makes graphene very perspective for electronics .",
    "another important property of freely suspended graphene is a strong e - e interaction that essentially distorts the single - particle spectra .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is an envelope - approximation study of possibility of the wannier - mott excitons formation near the conic point in a neutral graphene .",
    "there were a lot of studies considered the excitons in graphene .",
    "in all these papers the term  exciton  is used for many - body (  excitonic  ) effects @xcite , exciton insulator with full spectrum reconstruction , or exciton - like singularities originating from saddle points ( van hove singularity ) of the single - particle spectrum @xcite where the real electron - hole binding does not occur . on the contrary ,",
    "our goal is pair bound states of electrons and holes .",
    "it is a widely accepted opinion that zero gap in graphene forbids the mott exciton states ( see , i.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "this statement is valid in the conic approximation only .",
    "taking the real spectrum structure into account makes the electron - hole binding possible .",
    "namely , it will be shown that the exciton is conditioned by the trigonal corrections to the conic spectrum .",
    "the trigonal warping of the energy spectrum is responsible for the electron - electron scattering selection rules in the neutrality point and , consequently , a specific mechanism of the valley currents in graphene @xcite .",
    "here we shall demonstrate that the presence of the warping drastically affects the possibility of electron - hole binding also .",
    "graphene has no energy gap , hence we consider an electron - hole bound state with the energy lying in the free electron - hole continuum .",
    "such exciton states exist in usual semiconductors with gaps .",
    "however , there is an important difference between quadratic energy spectrum of particles @xmath0 and the conic spectrum in graphene @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is electron velocity in the conic approximation . speaking in classical language , for quadratic energy spectrum",
    "the attraction leads to oscillations of particles captured in a mutual well . on the contrary , for the conic spectrum",
    "the character of motion of two particles is different , namely , the distance between particles with parallel momenta remains constant due to equality of velocities .",
    "the correct description of motion needs going beyond the conic approximation . in this case",
    "the series expansion of the pair kinetic energy in the relative momentum determines the finite inverse mass ( second derivative of energy with respect to the relative momentum ) that leads to the variation of the e - h distance .",
    "the pair remains bound if the sign of this mass is positive .",
    "this picture remains valid in the quantum consideration .",
    "owing to the dependence of the sign of the mass on the exciton momentum angle , the binding exists in the particular sectors of the total momentum space and is forbidden in others .",
    "we consider graphene with weakly interacting charged carriers , when the interaction constant @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is electron charge , @xmath5 is the half - sum of dielectric constants of surrounding media , @xmath6 .",
    "this condition guarantee the smallness of the binding energy as compared with the kinetic energy ( in other words , applicability of envelope function approximation ) and negligibility of many - body effects .",
    "we consider graphene with primitive translation vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 nm is the lattice constant .",
    "the starting point is the tight - binding electron hamiltonian @xmath10 here @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the spectrum reads as @xmath15 the primitive reciprocal lattice has basis vectors @xmath16 .    in the considered case",
    "the exciton states are composed from a narrow group in the momentum space near the points @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the single - electron spectrum is conic : @xmath21 and @xmath22 , correspondingly . in the envelope approximation",
    "the two - body hamiltonian is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hole hamiltonian , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the coordinates and momenta of electron and hole , @xmath27 is the potential of the electron - hole interaction .",
    "the electron and hole hamiltonians relate to the electron and the hole subspaces of quantum numbers .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hexc ] ) has a 4-fold set of eigenstates , one of which belongs to the ordinary exciton , namely , a pair with  an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band  .",
    "let us carry out an unitary transform @xmath28 of the hamiltonian ( [ hexc ] ) , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 diagonalize @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the smallness of the binding energy means a large size of exciton wave function and the smallness of the spatial derivatives ; in that case one can neglect the non - commutativity of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", we get to the hamiltonian : @xmath35    the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be expressed via pair @xmath38 and relative @xmath39 momenta .",
    "the momenta can be situated near the same ( @xmath40 ) ( the direct exciton ) or near the opposite conic points ( @xmath41 @xmath42 ) ( the indirect exciton ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    expanding the hamiltonian with respect to @xmath43",
    ", we find for the indirect excitons @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the components of the tensor of inverse masses @xmath46 read @xmath47    here @xmath48 in the conic approximation @xmath42 , and the hamiltonian ( [ hexc2 ] ) can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the kinetic energy of a free pair , the coordinate system with basis vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 is chosen , @xmath53 is a warping parameter and we have @xmath54 , @xmath55 . to obtain finite @xmath56",
    ", one should go beyond the conic approximation .",
    "for the indirect exciton with the momenta close to @xmath57 , ( @xmath58 ) , we have @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an angle between @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the effective mass @xmath56 is directly determined by the trigonal contributions to the spectrum and is parametrically large : @xmath63 .",
    "the sign of @xmath56 is determined by @xmath64 . if @xmath65 , the electron and the hole tend to bind , otherwise to run away from each other .",
    "thus , the binding is possible for @xmath65 .",
    "the similar reasoning for the pair from the same valley shows that the trigonal contributions to @xmath66 cancel each other .",
    "the contributions of a higher order give , in this case , a negative mass @xmath66 : @xmath67 . as a result",
    ", the electron - hole binding is forbidden for particles from the same valley .",
    "let us consider indirect excitons apart from the conic points .",
    "the condition of their existence is positively definiteness of the kinetic energy @xmath68 . in other words , both eigenvalues of the tensor",
    "@xmath69 should be positive .",
    "we find from eq .",

    "so the way of solution is similar to the problem of the molecular levels .",
    "first , we cancel @xmath79 , fix the  ion  coordinate",
    " @xmath80  and determine the energy terms @xmath81 , then use these terms as ions potential energy .",

    "however , the momentum conservation preserves the exciton from a decay , unless scattering processes ( weak by assumptions ) are taken into account .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the indirect exciton has two - fold degeneracy , in accordance with its total momentum .",
    "these two states have opposite symmetry in @xmath61 space .",
    "let us discuss the possibility of optical observation of the indirect excitons in graphene . in a semiconductor with the energy gap the excitons contribute to the absorption and , especially , to the emission of light .",
    "the absence of the energy gap makes observation of the excitons in graphene a different problem from the case of a usual semiconductor , because the exciton energies are distributed between zero and several tenth of ev which smears up the exciton resonance . the large momentum of the indirect exciton blocks both the direct optical excitation and the recombination .",
    "however , the slow recombination and the inter - valley relaxation preserve the excitons ( when generated someway ) from the recombination or the decay .",
    "the frequency of photons with a small wave vectors , which can produce excitons , is very low . in that case",
    ", the solution can be found using a phonon - or impurity - assisted absorption or a structure where electrons obtain an additional in - plane momentum from an artificial grating or a naturally riffle of the graphene plane .    the phonon - assisted indirect exciton optical absorption has thresholds determined by one of phonon frequencies @xmath127 , where @xmath128 numerates the phonon type .",
    "corresponding contribution to the absorption near the threshold @xmath127 is determined by the exciton density of states and is proportional to @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the light frequency .",
    "this threshold behavior should be compared with more smooth threshold for free pair excitation @xmath131 .",
    "one can expect the manifestation of the exciton by an appearance of the maximum in the second derivative of absorption with respect to @xmath130 at @xmath132 .",
    "the other perspective way to observe excitons is based on a monolayer character of graphene .",
    "being placed in a vacuum , the graphene layer can be studied by the scattering of vacuum electrons ( forward or backward ) on the graphene .",
    "the dependence of the energy loss maximum on the scattering angle gives the spectrum of the bose excitation , in particular , excitons .",
    "the exciton spectrum gets into the operation range of the high - resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels ) with incident electron energy @xmath133ev @xcite .",
    "the hreels spectra of graphene were studied in @xcite ( e - h pair continuum spectrum ) and in @xcite ( plasmarons ) .",
    "we hope that the careful examination of the in - plane angle dependence of losses will help the identification of the exciton transitions .",

    "the amplitude @xmath136 obtains an additional multiplier , the sommerfeld factor @xmath145 , reflecting the value of the exciton wave function at coinciding electron and hole coordinates .",
    "the probability of transitions representing inelastic diffraction is determined by a sum over the reciprocal lattice vectors : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the bare electron mass .",

    "besides , the sommerfeld factor also gives the functional dependence on the small momentum .",

    "the principal assumption used in the present study is the smallness of the dimensionless interaction constant @xmath162 , which provides the smallness of the exciton binding energy as compared with its kinetic energy .",
    "the considered exciton states in graphene are formed near the conic points .",
    "we have based ourselves on the nearest - neighbor tight - binding model which possesses electron - hole symmetry .",
    "in fact , this symmetry is broken in graphene .",
    "the model of @xcite ( see , eq .",
    "( 2.21 ) ) accounting the asymmetry results in an additional contribution to the single - particle spectrum near the conic point : @xmath163 .",
    "however , the electron and hole contributions cancel each other in the pair energy and , hence , have no effect on the e - h binding .",
    "the exciton states are stable towards the collisionless decay to free electron and hole pairs . at the same time",
    ", the scattering on impurities or phonons destroys the moving excitons .",
    "the weakness of this process is conditioned by the smallness of the scattering processes with participation of impurities or phonons . a rough estimate of this weakness is given by the ratio of electron scattering rate to the binding energy .    among other kinds of scattering the auger processes",
    "should be underlined .",
    "as the energy grows , the scattering with e - h pair production becomes prevailing in the momentum sectors where it is permitted @xcite .",
    "one can see that these sectors coincides with the domains of exciton existence .",
    "the e - h scattering rate estimate gives @xmath164 .",
    "this value should be compared with the exciton binding energy @xmath165 .",
    "parametrically , the large parameter @xmath166 results in the smallness of damping . at the same time",
    "the width of excited exciton states is comparable with their binding energy , that makes the excited exciton states unlikely observable .",
    "let us briefly consider the suppression of excitons in graphene due to screening by the finite concentration of equilibrium charged carriers @xmath167 . in the gapped semiconductors slow excitons are actual only .",
    "the equilibrium electrons and holes screen quasistatic interaction between the pair composing the exciton .",
    "vice versa , charged carriers in graphene can follow the moving excitons only partly .",
    "the binding energy stays non - perturbed if the screening radius for the moving pair is larger than the exciton radius .",
    "the condition for exciton existence can be estimated as @xmath168 .",
    "it should be emphasized , that in the case under consideration the total exciton energy remains positive due to the smallness of interaction and trigonal corrections .",
    "this forbids the spectrum reconstruction , such as the exciton insulator .",
    "we have neglected the many - body corrections to single - electron spectrum .",
    "actually , the e - e interaction leads to the electron self - energy @xmath169 , @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "thus , we need , that not only @xmath171 , but typical @xmath172 .",
    "the presence of this logarithmic term strongly changes the behavior of the single - electron spectrum at small @xmath125 and gives a negative contribution to @xmath56 .",
    "however , this does not forbid the exciton absolutely .",
    "in fact , the interaction - induced correction to the inverse mass @xmath173 should be added to the warping correction . in a particular case of small interaction constant @xmath162 ,",
    "mass @xmath56 becomes negative at low @xmath125 and near the boundaries of the existence sectors .",
    "this narrows the range of exciton existence and shifts it from the conic point .",
    "another remark concerns the renormalization of the dielectric constant @xmath5 , caused by the vacuum polarization of graphene @xcite .",
    "the renormalization reduces the coulomb interaction at large distance , as if the dielectric constant of external medium becomes logarithmically large .",
    "this fact improves the applicability of the weak - interaction model , even in the case of free - suspended graphene .",
    "the excitons considered in the present paper arise near the conic points , unlike the saddle - point exciton states with energies about 5 ev studied in @xcite .",
    "the latter , in our opinion , correspond to the e - h scattering resonance , rather than bound states .",
    "the other investigations of exciton resonances is based on the electron spectrum reconstruction caused by large interaction constant @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility of gapless excitons in a system with small @xmath162 considered here had not been studied earlier .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated the existence of moving indirect excitons in monolayer graphene and found their energies .",
    "the excitons are conditioned by the presence of the warping of the electron spectrum .",
    "the excitons spectrum has no gap .",
    "the many - body interaction corrections to the single - particle spectrum , in concurrence with warping , lead to the destruction of excitons with small wave vectors .",
    "however , the excitons survive if the interaction constant is small .",
