    "a physical assessment of the bolometric emission of stars is a mandatory step for any attempt to self - consistently link observations and theoretical predictions of stellar evolution .",
    "the importance of this comparison actually reverberates into a wide range of primary astrophysical questions , ranging from the validation of the reference input physics for nuclear reactions in the stellar interiors to the study of integrated spectrophotometric properties of distant galaxies , through stellar population synthesis models .    by definition , the effective temperature ( t@xmath3 ) and physical size ( @xmath18 ) of a star",
    "provide the natural constraint to its emerging flux , as @xmath19 . if @xmath20 is a known property for a star , then we could physically `` rescale '' the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and infer , from the observed flux , the distance of the body , @xmath21 , or its absolute size ( @xmath18 ) , through a measure of the apparent angular extension , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "as well known , however , @xmath20 can not , in principle , be _ directly _ measured , requiring for this task an ideal detector equally sensitive to the whole spectral range . the lack of this crucial piece of information is often palliated by indirect observing methods , trying to pick up the bulk of stellar emission through broad - band photometry within the appropriate spectral range according to target temperature .. ] relying on this approach , @xcite derived the bolometric vs.  temperature scale for red giant stars , while @xcite explored the same relation for hot early - type stars , through satellite - borne uv observations .",
    "as an alternative way , many authors tried a fully theoretical assessment of the problem , by studying the @xmath23 vs.  @xmath24 relationship on the basis of model grids of stellar atmospheres and replacing observations with synthetic photometry directly computed on the theoretical sed @xcite .    rather than focussing on luminosity , @xcite originally proposed a further application of this method , just looking at the bolometric surface brightness , namely @xmath25 , to lead to a refined temperature scale of stars in force of the fundamental relationship @xmath26 ( @xmath27 being the stefan - boltzmann constant ) .",
    "the so - called surface - brightness technique , then better recognized as the ir - flux method ( irfm ) , has been extensively applied to the study of red giant and supergiant stars @xcite taking advantage of its distance - independent results , providing to match the angular measure of stellar radii with the estimate of the bolometric flux from infrared observations , i.e.  @xmath28 .",
    "although in different forms , all the previous methods used theoretical models of stellar atmospheres to derive the appropriate `` correcting factor '' @xmath29 and convert observed or synthetic monochromatic magnitudes , @xmath30 to the bolometric scale .",
    "dimensionally matches the definition of `` equivalent width '' , and it gives a measure of how `` broad '' is the whole sed compared to the monochromatic emission density at the reference @xmath31 . ]    taking the sun as a reference source for our calibration , we could write more explicitely : @xmath32- [ m_{\\rm bol } - m(\\lambda)]_\\odot   = -2.5\\,\\log ( { \\cal r / r}_\\odot ) \\label{eq : bc}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ eq : bc ] ) actually leads to the straight definition of _ bolometric correction _ , @xmath33 , namely @xmath34    aside from the historical definition , that originally considered bc only to photographic ( @xmath35 ) or visual ( @xmath36 ) magnitudes @xcite , one can nowadays easily extend the definition to any waveband . a careful analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc2 ] ) makes clear some important properties of @xmath37 : _ i ) _ the value of @xmath38 is a composite function of stellar fundamental parameters , namely @xmath39)$ ] so that , for fixed effective temperature , @xmath37 may display some dependence on stellar gravity ( @xmath40 ) and chemical composition ( @xmath41 $ ] ) ; _ ii ) _ the value of @xmath38 ( and , accordingly , of @xmath37 ) is minimum when our observations catch the bulk of stellar luminosity . for this reason , high values of @xmath16 must be expected when observing for instance cool giant stars in the @xmath42 band , or hot o - b stars in the infrared @xmath43 band .",
    "_ iii ) _ the definition of the @xmath37 scale strictly depends on the assumed reference value for the sun , that therefore must univocally fix the `` zero point '' of the scale @xcite .    in this framework , we want to tackle here the central question of the possible @xmath37 dependence on stellar metallicity .",
    "this effect could be of special importance , in fact , in order to more confidently set the bolometric vs.  temperature scale for cool red giants , where the intervening absorption of diatomic ( tio _ in primis _ ) and triatomic ( h@xmath44o ) molecules heavily modulate the stellar sed with sizeable effects on optical and nir magnitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a matter of fact , still nowadays the many efforts devoted to the definition of the @xmath37 vs.  @xmath45 relationship led to non univocal conclusions , with large discrepancies among the different sources in the literature as far as stars of k spectral type or later are concerned @xcite .",
    "this issue has actually an even more important impact on the study of the integrated spectrophotometric properties of resolved and unresolved stellar systems , as red giants and other post - main sequence ( pms ) stars provide a prevailing fraction ( 2/3 or more , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the total luminosity of the population .",
    "a fair definition of the @xmath37 scale becomes therefore of paramount importance to self - consistently convert theoretical h - r and observed c - m diagrams of a stellar population @xcite and more confidently assess the physical contribution of the different stellar classes .",
    "a study of the @xmath37 dependence on metal abundance has been previously attempted by many authors mainly relying on a fully theoretical point of view to exploit the obvious advantage of stellar models to account in a controlled way for a global or selective change of metal abundance . in this",
    "regard , @xcite and @xcite , among others , tried to explore the effect of @xmath46 elements enhancement ( namely o , mg , ca , ti etc . ) in stellar sed , while @xcite focussed on the possible impact of helium abundance on @xmath37 .",
    "as a major drawback of these efforts , however , one has to report the admitted limit of model atmospheres in accurately describe the spectrophotometric properties of k- and m - type stars , that are cooler than 4000  k ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* on this important point ) .",
    "on the other hand , a fully empirical approach has been devised by @xcite and @xcite , among others , trying to reconstruct stellar sed , and therefrom infer the bolometric flux , @xmath23 , through optical broad - band photometry of stars in the galactic field or in globular clusters .",
    "a recognized limit of these studies is , however , that they may suffer from the lack of coverage of the stellar parameter space offered by the observations . moreover , as far as the cool - star sequence is concerned , optical multicolor photometry , alone , partially misses the bulk of stellar emission ( more centered toward the nir spectral window ) ; in addition , by converting broad - band magnitudes into monochromatic flux densities , the stellar sed is reconstructed at very poor spectral resolution , thus possibly loosing important features that may bias the inferred bolometric energy budget .    on this line ,",
    "however , we want to further improve the analysis proposing here more complete spectroscopic observations for a large grid of red - giant stars in several galactic clusters along the entire metallicity scale from very metal - poor ( i.e.   @xmath47 \\simeq -2.2 $ ]  dex ) to super - solar ( @xmath47 \\simeq + 0.4 $ ]  dex ) stellar populations .",
    "our observations span the whole optical and nir wavelength range , thus allowing a quite accurate shaping of stellar sed . as we will demonstrate in the following of our discussion , our procedure allowed us to sample about 70 - 90 % of the total emission of our sample stars , thus leading to a virtually _ direct _ measure of @xmath23 , even for m - type stars as cool as 3500  k.    we will arrange our discussion by presenting , in sec .  2 , our stellar database together with further available information in the literature .",
    "the analysis of the observing material will be assessed in more detail in sec .  3 , while in sec .",
    "4 we will derive the sed for the whole sample leading to an estimate of the effective temperature and bolometric correction for each star . the discussion of the inferred bc - color - temperature scale will be the focus of sec .  5 , especially addressing the possible dependence of bc on stellar metallicity .",
    "the comparison of our results with other relevant bc calibration in the literature will also be carried out in this section , while in sec .",
    "6 we will summarize the main conclusions of our work .",
    "as we mainly aim at probing the impact of metallicity on the bc of stars at the low - temperature regime , a demanding constraint to set up our target sample was to explore a range as wide as possible in [ fe / h ] , and pick up red giant stars with accurate measurements of their metallicity .",
    "the cluster population in the galaxy naturally provided the ideal environment for our task . by combining globular and open clusters one can easily span the whole metallicity range pertinent to pop i and ii stars in our and in external galaxies .",
    "we therefore selected five template systems , namely the three metal - poor globular clusters m15 , m2 and m71 , and two metal - rich open clusters ngc  188 and ngc  6791 such as to let metallicity span almost three orders of magnitude , from [ fe / h ]  @xmath48 up to + 0.4 .    for each cluster , a subset of @xmath49 suitable targets",
    "have then been identified among the brightest and coolest red giants from the 2mass infrared c - m diagram @xcite . in assembling the dataset we also took care of picking up those objects out of more severely crowded regions of the clusters , and clearly recognizable in bright asterisms such as to reduce the chance of misidentification at the telescope .",
    "the final set of target stars is summarized , for each cluster , in the five panels of fig .",
    "[ f0 ] and in the series of tables [ t2 ] to [ t6 ] .",
    "we eventually considered 92 stars in total , of which 21 are in m15 , 18 in m2 , 17 in m71 , 16 in ngc  188 , and 20 in ngc  6791 , respectively . for each star",
    ", the tables always report the 2mass i d number ( col .  1 ) and the alternative cross - identification , according to other reference photometric catalogs , when available .",
    "the 2mass j2000 coordinates on the sky and the corresponding @xmath50 magnitudes are also always reported , together with a compilation of @xmath51 observed magnitudes according to the best reference catalogs for each cluster , as reported in the literature .",
    "when required , dereddened apparent magnitudes have been computed according to the color excess @xmath52 as labelled in the header of each table .",
    "spectroscopic observations of our stellar sample have been collected during several runs between june and october 2003 at the 3.5 m telecopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) of the roque de los muchachos observatory , at la palma ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "a summary of the logbook can be found in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "optical spectroscopy was carried out with the lrs fosc camera ; a composite spectrum was collected for each target by matching a blue ( grism lrb along the @xmath53  wavelength range ) and a red setup ( grism lrr , between @xmath54   ) . in both cases",
    "the grisms provided a dispersion of 2.8    px@xmath55 on a @xmath56 thinned and back - illuminated loral ccd , with a 13.5@xmath57 m pixel size . in order to collect the entire flux from target stars ,",
    "we observed through a 5wide slit ; this condition actually made spectral resolution to be eventually constrained by the seeing figure ( typically about 1 - 1.5along the different nights ) , thus ranging between 10 and 15    ( fwhm ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a value of @xmath58 between 600 - 1000 .",
    "whenever possible , and avoiding severe crowding conditions of the target fields , the longslit was located at the parallactic angle .",
    "wavelength calibration and data reductions were performed following standard procedures .",
    "[ t2 ]    the optical spectra have then been accompanied by the corresponding observations taken at infrared wavelength with the nics camera at the nasmyth focus of the tng .",
    "the camera was coupled with a rockwell 1024@xmath591024 hawaii-1 hgcdte detector .",
    "we took advantage of nics unique design using the amici grism coupled with two slits 0.5and 5wide , the latter being used for a complete flux sampling of the target stars .",
    "the spectra cover the entire wavelength range from 8000    to 2.5  @xmath57 m at a resolving power ( for a 0.5slit ) which varies between @xmath60 and 140 along the spectrum . in acquiring spectra , background subtraction and flat - fielding correction were eased by a standard dithering procedure on target images , while the wavelength calibration directly derived from the standard reference table providing the dispersion relation of the system .",
    "the midas eso package , and specifically its longslit routine set , has been used for the whole reduction procedure , both for optical and infrared spectra .",
    "[ t3 ]    [ t4 ]    [ t5 ]    [ t6 ]      given the nature of our investigation , special care has been devoted to suitably fluxing both optical and infrared spectra .",
    "this has been carried out by repeated observations , both with lrs and nics , of a grid of spectrophotometric standard stars from the list of @xcite and @xcite , as reported in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "note , however , that the lack of an appropriate sed calibration of standard stars along the entire wavelength range of our observations required a two - step procedure , relying on the direct observation of vega as a primary calibrator , according to @xcite results . given the outstanding luminosity of this star we had to observe through a 10 mag neutral filter to avoid ccd saturation , and create a secondary calibrator ( namely hd192281 ) observed both with and without the neutral density filter .",
    "concerning the applied correction for atmosphere absorption , we had to manage two delicate problems .",
    "from one hand , in fact , the intervening action of sahara dust ( the so - called `` calima effect '' ) may abruptly increase the atmosphere opacity at optical wavelength .",
    "this is a recurrent feature for summer nights at la palma , and it can severily affect the observing output , especially when dealing with absolute flux calibration .",
    "a careful check with repeated observations of the same standard stars along each night allowed us to assess the presence of dust in the air .",
    "this confirmed , for instance , that along our observing runs , the night of aug 07 , 2003 displayed an outstanding ( i.e.  a factor of four higher than the average ) dust extinction .",
    "on the other hand , atmosphere water vapour can also play a role by affecting in unpredictable ways the infrared observations .",
    "telluric h@xmath44o bands about 1.10 , 1.38 and 1.88  @xmath57 m @xcite , just restraining to the amici wavelength range , may in fact strongly contaminate the _ intrinsic _ h@xmath44o absorption bands of stellar sed , especially for stars cooler than 3500  k @xcite .",
    "this effect may act on short timescales along the night , so that it can not be reconducted to an average nightly extinction curve , as for optical observations .",
    "the h@xmath44o contamination in each spectrum was therefore corrected by re - scaling the average extinction curve to minimize the residual water vapour feature in the stellar spectra .",
    "[ t1 ]    allover , the full calibration procedure led us to consistently assemble the lrb - lrr - amici spectral branches and obtain a nominal sed of target stars along the 3450 - 25000    wavelength range .",
    "however , just an eye inspection of the full spectra made evident in some cases a residual systematic component causing a `` glitch '' at the boundary connection between lrs and nics observations . clearly , this effect urged us to further refine our analysis taking into account the supplementary photometric piece of information , as we will discuss in more detail in the next section .",
    "the relevant database of broad - band photometry available in the literature for all stars in our sample can be usefully accounted for our analysis as a supplementary tool to tackle the inherent difficulty in reproducing the overall shape of stellar sed at the required accuracy level over the entire range of our observations .    as summarized in tables [ t2 ] to [ t6 ] , a wide collection of photometric catalogs",
    "can be considered , providing multicolor photometry along the range spanned by lrs and nics spectra .",
    "facing the observed values , one can similarly derive a corresponding set of multicolor synthetic magnitudes relying on the assembled sed of each star .",
    "operationally , from our @xmath61 values we need to numerically assess the quantity    @xmath62    being @xmath63 the synthetic magnitude in the _",
    "`` j - th '' _ photometric band , identified by a filter response @xmath64 and a calibrating zero - point flux @xmath65 . for our calculations we relied on the @xcite reference data ( see table  1 therein ) .",
    "a comparison of our output with the available photometry is displayed in fig .",
    "the magnitude difference ( in the sense `` synthetic '' - `` observed '' ) , is plotted in the different panels of the figure vs.  _ observed _ color , according to the different photometric catalogs quoted in tables [ t2 ] to [ t6 ] .",
    "as typically two sources for @xmath42 magnitudes are available for most clusters , observed colors have been computed for each available @xmath42 dataset and are displayed with a different marker ( either dot or square ) in the plots .",
    "just a glance to fig .",
    "[ f1 ] makes evident that systematic offsets are present between observed photometry and synthetic magnitudes .",
    "this may partly be due to zero - point uncertainty in computing eq .",
    "( [ eq : mag ] ) , as well as to residual systematic drifts inherent to our spectral flux calibration .",
    "in addition , from the figure one has also to report a few outliers in every band , and a notably skewed distribution of @xmath66 residuals . to recover for this systematics we devised an iterative @xmath67 clipping procedure on the data of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] to reject deviant stars and lead synthetic magnitudes to match the standard photometric system of the observed catalogs .",
    "our results are displayed in graphical form in the plots of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .",
    "after just a few rejections , our procedure quickly converged to mean magnitude offsets ( @xmath68 , see table  [ t7 ] ) to correct eq .",
    "( [ eq : mag ] ) output .",
    "after correction for this systematics , our final synthetic photometry of cluster stars ( not accouting for galactic reddening ) is collected in tables  [ t8 ] and [ t9 ] . according to table  [ t7 ] ,",
    "note that a @xmath69  mag in total magnitude residuals evidently implies an _ internal _ accuracy in our spectral flux calibration of target stars better than 10% .",
    "[ t7 ]    [ t8 ]    [ t9 ]      it could be interesting to analyze in some detail the deviant stars in our @xmath70 clipping procedure in order to collect further clues about their nature . apart from the obvious impact of photometric errors , @xmath67 outliers may in fact more likely be displaying signs of an intrinsic physical variability in their luminosity .    as summarized in table  [ t10 ] , in total 10 stars have been found to significantly ( @xmath71 ) deviate from the literature compilations .",
    "a careful check of their identifications on the simbad database indicates that at least 3 of them are known variable ( typically semir - regulars or irregulars , as expected for their nature of late - type red giants ) .",
    "sbg  2240 @xcite and not a deviant in our spectroscopic observations .",
    "] no firm conclusions can be drawn , on the contrary , for the other seven cases , although it is evident even from a color check ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) that they have been picked up in an intrinsically different status with respect to previous data in the literature . and @xmath72 outliers .",
    "both photometric bands actually cover the `` bluer '' wavelength regions of both the lrs and nics spectra , respectively .",
    "this coincidence might perhaps indicate some hidden problem with the flux calibration procedure during the observation of this cluster .",
    "] we therefore commend the stars in the list of table  [ t10 ] as special candidates for further in - depth investigations for variability .",
    "the synthetic photometric catalogs obtained from the observed spectral database had a twofold aim : firstly , this procedure allowed us to self - consistently match broad - band magnitudes with the inferred measure of @xmath73 , in order to obtain the corresponding value of the bolometric correction ; secondly , the study of the magnitude residuals with respect to the literature data provided us with the appropriate offsets in flux rescaling such as to `` smoothly '' connect our optical and infrared spectra and lead therefore to a more accurate estimate of @xmath73 .",
    "[ t10 ]    operationally , for the latter task , we proceeded as follows .",
    "taking into account the individual set of @xmath74 magnitude residuals , for each star in our sample we computed a mean optical and infrared offset ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively ) by separately averaging the @xmath51 and @xmath50 mag residuals .",
    "the lrs spectra and the nics observations have then been matched by multiplying visual and ir fluxes by a factor @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "foreground reddening has been corrected relying on the standard relation @xmath79 @xcite , where the appropriate value of the color excess @xmath52 is from the headers of tables  [ t2 ] to [ t6 ] . in its final form ,",
    "the sed is reshaped such as @xmath80 .",
    "the lrs and nics spectra have been connected at 8800   , by smoothing the wavelength region between 7800 and 10000   ( in order to gain s / n , especially for lrs poor signal at the long wavelenegth edge ) . in fig .",
    "[ f35 ] , we summarize our results for an illustrative set of seds by picking up for each cluster the brightest ( i.e.  roughly the coolest ) and faintest ( i.e.  warmest ) stars in our sample.eps/home.html . ] note , from the figure , the stricking presence of the co bump about 1.6  @xmath57 m @xcite , as well as the broad h@xmath44o absorption bands to which the sharper ( and variable ) emission of telluric water vapor superposes ( see , in particular , the case of m15 stars in the figure ) .",
    "this made far more difficult any accurate cleaning procedure , as we discussed in sec .",
    "although sampled over a wide wavelength range , sed of our stars still lacks the contribution of ultraviolet and far - infrared luminosity . clearly ,",
    "a safe assessment of this contribution is mandatory to lead to a confident measure of the bolometric magnitude .",
    "as the amount of energy released outside the spectral window of our observations critically depends on stellar temperature , our task to compute @xmath37 requires in fact a parallel calibration of @xmath81 in the range of our red giant stars .    among the many outstanding efforts in this direction",
    ", we have to recall the works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in their exhaustive analysis , @xcite provided an accurate analytical set of fitting functions , that calibrate stellar effective temperature vs.  johnson / cousins broad - band colors .",
    "the @xcite calibration relies on the irfm estimate of stellar surface brightness , and considers stars of spectral type k5 or earlier , spanning a wide metallicity range ( @xmath82 \\la + 0.2 $ ] ) . within this range ,",
    "the authors claim an internal accuracy in the definition of @xmath81 better than 5% . as a further important result of their work ,",
    "some colors , like @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are found to be fair tracers of temperature , almost independently from stellar metallicity .",
    "the @xcite calibration , however , strictly applies only to stars warmer than @xmath87  k , while our stellar sample definitely spans a wider color range .",
    "this is certainly the case , for instance , of the brightest giant stars in ngc  6791 , too ( infra)red to match the alonso et al .",
    "fitting functions . for these cases",
    "one could rely on the wider validity range of the @xmath8 calibration , although the advantage may only be a nominal one as any optical color , like @xmath8 tends naturally to saturate when moving to @xmath88  k ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig .  2 in @xcite )",
    ".    considering the whole set of the alonso et al .",
    "fitting functions , we eventually chose four reference colors to assess the value of effective temperature for our stars .",
    "two colors , namely @xmath8 and @xmath85 are entirely comprised within the lrs and nics spectral branches , respectively , and they can therefore ostensibly probe the shape of sed in a more self - consistent way . to these two colors we also added @xmath89 and @xmath9 , as they provided a check of our flux calibration bridging the optical and infrared regions of the spectra .    [ t11 ]    [ t12 ]    dereddened colors for each stars in our sample provided eventually a set of nominal values of @xmath81 , by entering the appropriate fitting functions .",
    "the `` allowed '' values of @xmath81 ( i.e.  if comprised within the boundary limits of the adopted calibration functions ) were then averaged , deriving the mean fiducial value of the effective temperature , reported in table  [ t11 ] and [ t12 ] ( column  10 ) . in case of just one @xmath81 estimate ( typically from @xmath85 color )",
    "we also added the @xmath9 output ( reported in italics in the tables ) trusting on a fairly smooth trend of the @xcite calibration for this color , when extrapolated to cooler temperatures ( see fig .  8 and fig .",

    ", the bc vs.  color relationship can be regarded as an _ intrinsic _ ( i.e.  distance - independent ) feature characterizing the stellar sed . on the corresponding theoretical side ,",
    "we want also to study here the resulting dependence of bc on stellar effective temperature , a relation that allows us to more directly match the observations with the theoretical predictions of stellar model atmospheres .    in a first set of plots ( see fig .  [ f9 ] ) , we display the observed distribution of our stars in the different planes . in order to single out any possible dependence on chemical composition of stars",

    "for better convenience in our study , we also fitted the overall distribution analytically ; a useful set of fitting functions for the bc vs.  t@xmath3 relations along the @xmath112  k temperature range results : @xmath113    as for the color relations , the non - monotonic trend of bc@xmath11 vs.  @xmath8 ( see left upper panel in fig .",

    "note how difficult it is to firmly constrain the @xmath8 vs.  bc@xmath11 behaviour at very low temperature . from one hand , in fact ,",
    "the intervening effect of the tio absoprtion at visual wavelength @xcite makes the @xmath8 color of stars cooler than @xmath115  k to strongly saturate reaching a maximum of about @xmath116 and turning back to bluer values for later m - type stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the apparent trend of our sample in this range is evidently biased by the ngc  6791 stellar population with just a few super metal rich giants constraining the bc@xmath11 trend at the most extreme negative values .      as a part of our observing strategy ,",
    "the sampled stellar population of the five clusters would in principle allow to better single out any possible dependence of bc on stellar chemical composition . as far as helium content is concerned , for instance ,",
    "this problem has already been tackled by @xcite through a series of theoretical models based on the @xcite atlas9 model atmospheres . as a main result of their discussion , these authors did not find any relevant impact on stellar bc to optical photometric bands when helium changes up to @xmath117 , _ for fixed effective temperature_. to some extent , this is a not so surprising behaviour ; helium is in fact a substantial contributor to mean particle weight of stellar plasma but a negligible contributor to chemical opacity .",
    "accordingly , with varying @xmath118 in the chemical mix , one has to expect a much more explicit impact on stellar temperature _ for fixed mass of stars _ , rather than on colors or sed _ for fixed effective temperature _ ( as explored by @xcite models , indeed ) .",
    "the situation might in principle be different for the metals , mainly through their pervasive effect on stellar blanketing at short wavelength .",
    "in addition , metals are the basic ingredients required to produce molecules like tio , sih or ch , whose impact may be extremely relevant at blue and visual wavelength , when effective temperature lowers below 3500  k @xcite .    taking the results of tables [ t11 ] and [ t12 ] as a reference , in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] we plot the bc residual distribution computed as a difference between the inferred bc ( cols .",

    "just a glance to both panels of the figure makes evident the lack of any drift of bc with stellar metallicity . within the accuracy limits of our analysis",
    ", this means that two red giant stars of the same effective temperature but different [ fe / h ] have virtually indistiguishable values of bc to @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands .    on the other hand , to correctly understand our conclusion , one has to pay attention to the different temperature regimes that mark spectral properties of red - giant stars .",
    "in fact , stars warmer than @xmath87  k may have their sed depressed at short wavelength mostly in force of _ atomic _ transitions of fe and other metals ; on the contrary , for a cooler temperature , the metal opacity mainly acts in the form of _ molecular _ absorptions , making the broad band systems the prevailing features that modulate the stellar sed . as a consequence , while for stars of spectral type g or earlier any change of @xmath119 simply implies a change in the blanketing strength , this may not straightforwardly be the case for later spectral types , where molecules play a much more entangled role with changing @xmath81 .    in order to better quantify the terms of our analysis , in this respect , we display in fig .",

    "caveat _ in our discussion is therefore that we can only assess the impact of _ atomic _ blanketing on stellar bc , while no firm conclusions can be drawn for the bc dependence on molecular absorption , facing the evident bias of our star sample against cool ( @xmath121 ) objects .",
    "as far as the blanketing is the prevailing mechanism at work in g - k stars , basic physics of stellar atmospheres leads to conclude that the @xmath42-band ( and even more the @xmath43-band ) luminosity are nearly unaffected by metal absorption , so that bc can not vary much with [ fe / h ] .",
    "rather , @xmath66 ( and even more @xmath122 ) magnitudes must be more strongly modulated by metal abundance making bc@xmath123 ( and bc@xmath124 ) more directly sensitive to [ fe / h ] . on the other hand , as @xmath125 , one can straight `` translate '' this metallicity effect in terms of apparent @xmath8 color change .",

    "this figure is fully equivalent with , and can be compared to , fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , where we reported our own results .",
    "just a quick look to the different curves of fig .",
    "[ f12 ] gives an immediate picture of the inherent uncertainties in predicted bc according to the different calibration scales .",
    "the big issue , in this regard , much deals with the way models can reproduce cool stars and observations can account for the @xmath8 `` saturation '' vs.  temperature consequent to the shifted emission toward longer wavebands when stars become cooler than 3500  k. this effect makes the @xmath66-luminosity contribution to drop to nominal values among red giants , and the increasingly important role of molecular absorption strongly modulates optical colors of k- and m - type stars .",
    "the still inadequate theoretical performance in modelling such cool stars with convenient accuracy fatally frustrates also any empirical effort to derive a firm temperature scale and an accurate abundance analysis for stars at the extreme edge of the temperature distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , for useful considerations on this subject ) .",
    "as far as the bc@xmath11 vs.  @xmath8 behaviour is concerned , the reference calibrations display the largest spread , with m98 predicting increasingly redder stars with decreasing temperature . at the opposite ,",
    "nm predicts a sharp color `` turnback '' , with bc@xmath11 increasing in absolute value among cool stars getting bluer and bluer .",
    "definitely , the emipirical calibration by j66 still remains a reference one , fairly well tracking the observations .",
    "this trend is very closely replied also by the marcs models by h00 , that provide an even better match to the data and a substantial agreement with our fitting function as in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] .    by converting colors to the theoretical plane of effective temperature ( right upper panel of fig .",
    "[ f12 ] ) , the picture slightly changes , in particular with a stricking discrepancy of the j66 and the theoretical ng temperature scale for t@xmath132  k. both sources predict , in fact , much shallower corrections for cool stars than we observe .",
    "an overall agreement has to be reported , on the contrary , among the other calibrations , all replying our eq .",

    "the situation is much eased in the infrared domain , where a monotonic relationship between @xmath9 color and bc@xmath12 characterizes red giants stars . in this new framework both",
    "the theoretical and empirical planes are well reproduced by the different calibration scales , with the only remarkable exception of j66 that , to some extent `` allows '' stars to store a bigger fraction of their bolometric luminosity in the infrared .",
    "this leads to a tipping bc@xmath133 and a too `` red '' @xmath9 for a given value of t@xmath3 .    combining the different pieces of information coming from these comparisons",

    ", however , this conclusion may be even more puzzling from a physical point of view , as the h00 models have been _ a fortiori _ tuned up such as to reproduce the observed colors of m stars .",
    "as described by the authors , this required in particular to strongly enhance the assumed tio opacities well beyond the admitted physical range suggested by molecular theory and implemented in the `` standard '' marcs library @xcite .",
    "the firm knowledge of a fully reliable link between observations and stellar evolution models is a basic , crucial requirement for any safe use of stellar clocks and population synthesis templates in the study and interpretation of the integrated spectrophotometric properties of distant galaxies",
    ". actually , the `` stellar path '' to cosmology is strictly dependent , among others , on the accurate determination of the bolometric emission of stars , with varying effective temperatures and chemical abundance .    in this framework",
    ", we have tackled the central question of the possible bc dependence on stellar metallicity by securing spectroscopic observations for a wide sample of 92 red - giant stars in five ( 3 globular + 2 open ) galactic clusters along the full metallicity range from @xmath47 = -2.2 $ ] up to + 0.4 ( see sec .",

    "allover , we are confident that stellar sed along the entire sampled wavelength range has been set up within a @xmath135% internal accuracy ( see table  [ t7 ] and fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .    according to our previous arguments , however , one has also to carefully account for the lost contribution of ultraviolet and far - ir luminosity to the bolometric flux , depending on the effective temperature of stars .",
    "based on the @xcite t@xmath3-color fitting functions , we took the four colors @xmath8 , @xmath85 , @xmath89 , and @xmath9 as a reference for our calibration , leading to constrain t@xmath3 for each stars in our sample within an estimated error better than @xmath4  k ( see sec .",

    ".    the fiducial temperature allowed us to shape the unsampled portion of the sed at uv and far - ir wavelength by assuming a black - body emission independently rescaled such as to connect the short and long wavelength edge of the observed spectra .",
    "as shown in sec .",
    "4.2 ( see also fig .  [ f7 ] ) , under the black - body assumption , the internal uncertainty in our temperature scale only impact by a few 0.01  mag uncertainty in the inferred bolometric magnitude of our stars . in any case , by fully neglecting any unsampled spectral contribution , our data would be overestimating m@xmath6 by at most 0.3 mag .    making use of our new database ,",
    "we have been able to draw a convenient set of fitting functions for the bc vs.  t@xmath3 , valid over the interval @xmath137  k ( see sec .  5.1 , eq .",
    "[ eq : ddt ] ) .",
    "similar relationships for bc vs.  stellar colors can not be straightforwardly derived ( eq .

    "things may be different , however , for the @xmath66 ( and even more for @xmath122 ) magnitudes , where the blanketing effects are more and more severe .",
    "in fact , fig .  [ f11 ] clearly shows that metal - poor stars display a `` bluer '' @xmath8 compared to corresponding metal - rich objects with the same t@xmath3 .",
    "this leads us to conclude that a drift may be expected for @xmath140 such as @xmath141 $ ] among stars with fixed value of t@xmath3    to consistently verify our calibrations , we have shown in fig .",

    "as far as theoretical predictions are concerned , it seems that the h00 models are the best ones matching our data in every relationship .",
    "this feature is not a surprising one , however , given the recognized intention of the h00 calculations to match m stars via _ `` ad hoc '' _ tuning of molecular opacity .",

    "<S> a drift of @xmath13 vs. [ fe / h ] is in fact clearly evident from our data , with metal - poor stars displaying a `` bluer '' @xmath8 with respect to the metal - rich sample , for fixed t@xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> our empirical bolometric corrections are in good overall agreement with most of the existing theoretical and observational determinations , supporting the conclusion that ( a ) @xmath14 from the most recent studies are reliable within @xmath15 over the whole color / temperature range considered in this paper , and ( b ) the same conclusion apply to @xmath16 only for stars warmer than @xmath17  k. at cooler temperatures the agreement is less general , and marcs models are the only ones providing a satisfactory match to observations , in particular in the @xmath16 vs.  @xmath8 plane .    </S>",
