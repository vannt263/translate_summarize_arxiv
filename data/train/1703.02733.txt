    "the quest to construct a covariant renormalizable quantum gravity attracted more attention in recent years .",
    "different motivations to quantize gravity is classified by kiefer @xcite into three categories .",
    "first , the unification . after having a worthy quantum field theory for non  gravitational interactions , unifying quantum theory and general relativity , would be a logical wish .",
    "the next motivation comes from singularities of general theory of relativity .",
    "it seems that singularities break down the theory and it is expected to be solved with an appropriate quantum theory of gravity .",
    "finally the last motivation arises from the fact that there are different concepts of time in quantum theory and general relativity .",
    "time in the latter , is a dynamical object in contrast to quantum theory , in which it is introduced as an external parameter .",
    "quantum gravity may modify the concept of time in one or both of these theories .",
    "there are various approaches for building quantum theory of gravity . in @xcite ,",
    "these approaches are categorized in three sets .",
    "the first category is the _ covariant line _ , which is simply the quantum field theory of fluctuations over some background metric .",
    "this idea leads to higher derivative theories and string theory .",
    "the _ canonical line _ is the second approach , in which there is no need to introduce the background metric .",
    "the hilbert space can be considered as a representation of operators corresponding to the metric or functions of it .",
    "loop quantum gravity seems to be the latest one in this category . finally the name _ sum over histories line _ is assigned to the third set which contains versions of feynman s functional integral quantization for the suggested quantum gravity theory .",
    "discrete approaches and spinfoams formalism belong to this set .    in any perturbative approach , which is attractive to particle physicists , offering",
    "a finite quantity is an important point in a theory .",
    "one of the difficulties in perturbative quantization of gravity is the negative ( mass ) dimension of gravity coupling , i.e. newton constant , which leads to divergences at short distances or high energies .",
    "although renormalization of divergences necessarily does not result in a covariant formalism , but would be a vital issue in the suggested quantum gravity theory . in this context ,",
    "weinberg s _ asymptotic safety _ suggestion in 1979 @xcite based on the existence of non  gaussian fixed points , for which the renormalization group ( rg ) flow attracted by them at infinity , is notable .",
    "many successful research works have been done on the existence of these fixed points ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "the attraction of the rg  flow to this non ",
    "gaussian uv fixed points at short distances , protects the theory from divergences in that limit .    in 1998 , reuter suggested the truncated exact renormalization group ( erg ) method @xcite for probing non  gaussian fixed points , where the trajectories of running essential gauge couplings lie on the finite dimensional subspace of the theory space @xcite .",
    "it is known that the @xmath0-functions give us running couplings of the theory which are screened or anti  screened by loop corrections at short distance . treating couplings as fields",
    "can be seen in other theories such as scalar ",
    "tensor theories ( see references in @xcite ) , but here couplings run because of quantization in a systematic manner , i.e. rg equation .",
    "this evolved constant parameter , i.e. running coupling constant , can change the behavior of gravitational phenomena like black holes @xcite , galaxy rotation @xcite , cmb and etc .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of the improvement of gravitational and cosmological constants on the mukhanov ",
    "sassaki equation ( mse ) .",
    "this equation describes the growth of gauge invariant quantities constructed from quantum perturbations of metric and the inflation scalar field .",
    "these perturbations are usually considered as the primary seeds for inhomogeneities of cmb and the structure formation .",
    "therefore investigation of the effects of asymptotic safety method on the mse would be remarkable .",
    "the next section is dedicated to a brief introduction of erg and various improvement methods .",
    "then the improved mse ( imse ) would be derived in section [ improved perturbations and mse ] . in section",
    "[ solutions of imse ] , we obtain the solution of imse for two models , one with a scalar field responsible for the inflation , and one with a cosmological constant . finally in section [ improved power spectrum ] , effects of this improvement on the power spectrum are studied .",
    "truncated erg is one of the several methods for probing non  gaussian fixed points of gravity theory @xcite . in this approach , by truncating the scale  dependent effective action @xmath1 $ ] up to appropriate interaction terms , other non  effective interaction terms would be ignored .",
    "the evolution of these remaining gauge couplings , which can not be eliminated by fields redefinition , is obtained from the exact renormalization group equation ( erge ) .",
    "the trajectory of rg flow is @xmath2\\ ] ] where @xmath3 integrates out all the fluctuations at scale @xmath4 and connects the classical action at @xmath5 to the conventional effective action at @xmath6 .",
    "this average  like effective action , describes all gravitational phenomena at tree ",
    "level for each momentum scale @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , the ir  cutoff @xmath7 which appears in the definition of @xmath8 , eliminates the effects of fluctuations of @xmath9 on rg flow and is defined by an arbitrary smooth function @xmath10 where @xmath11 satisfies the conditions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the exponential form @xmath14 is a common chosen form in the literatures @xcite .",
    "since the multiplicity of couplings in the effective action makes the @xmath0-function intricate , truncation would project the rg flow into the finite dimensional subspace .",
    "this method gives a finite number of ordinary differential equations .",

    "using isotropy and homogeneity of frw metric , the cutoff energy @xmath4 could be considered explicitly and implicitly as a function of cosmological time , @xmath29 . here",
    "we will consider the simple form for the cutoff identification : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a positive constant of order unity ( for more identifications see @xcite ) .",
    "it has to be noted that since the big bang singularity is not eliminated in this model , @xmath32 stays as the age of the universe and the cutoff identification @xmath33 indicates elimination of the effects of the fluctuations with @xmath9 . with this identification",

    "the first and simplest way to do this can be called the _ solution improvement _ , in which the parameter @xmath42 is replaced by @xmath43 in any solution of the non  improved theory .",
    "the second approach is _",
    "equation improvement_. this is done at the level of the equations of motion , not the solutions .",
    "the difference between these two methods becomes bold for non  vacuum solutions and the latter seems to be more acceptable if the quantum corrections are negligible in the action .",
    "generally speaking the improvement of the equations of motion , may leads to solutions different from the former method .    by the third approach which we call the _ action parameters improvement",
    "_ , one means substitution of @xmath42 with @xmath43 in the action , without adding any kinetic term for it .",
    "the improved field equations are obtained from this new action and the externally prescribed field @xmath43 equation comes from the rge .",
    "if one adds some kinetic term for it , there would be no guarantee that the obtained @xmath43 coincides with the result of rge .",
    "finding a suitable kinetic term is very intricate .",
    "here we shall improve the equations of motion , which seems more suitable .",
    "metric perturbation during the inflation era and its relation to the matter inhomogeneity is an apt quantum mechanical mechanism generating initial seeds of structure formation ( for a complete review see ref .",
    "the perturbed metric has ten degrees of freedom , but only six of them are physical .",
    "the others , are unphysical because of gauge ( coordinate ) transformations . therefore",
    ", introducing gauge invariant quantities , helps us to have results that are independent of the chosen coordinate system . among different gauge invariant quantities , the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath44 would be an appropriate quantity to analyze the power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "symmetries of perturbation equations under translations make it easier to work with fourier modes , @xmath45 .",
    "these modes are not coupled because of the smallness of perturbations .    the evolution of @xmath46 in the non ",
    "improved theory follows the mse @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the conformal time and @xmath49 which is related to the time derivative of the scalar field as @xmath50 can be considered as the redshift . since the fourier transformation of 2-point function of the inflation field , i.e. the power spectrum , needs the solution of this differential equation , introducing the initial conditions is unavoidable .",
    "the wave number @xmath51 is proportional to the inverse of the comoving wavelength of the perturbations , and the conformal time is the comoving horizon , hence the quantity @xmath52 will be the ratio of causal horizon length to the comoving wavelength of the perturbations . for @xmath53 , the wavelength of the perturbations is larger than the length of causal horizon and the perturbations exit the horizon before the end of inflation . at the end of inflation , with growing the comoving hubble radius , @xmath54 , the wavelength of perturbations becomes smaller than the comoving hubble radius and thus the inhomogeneities and their effect on cmb gradually become observable .",
    "here we are interested in investigating the effects of quantum improvements of @xmath26 and @xmath27 on these observables .",
    "therefore , at the first step , we have to study briefly the effect of improvement on the perturbation equations .",
    "then imse in the @xmath55cdm universe will be obtained .",

    "the effect of asymptotic safety is more important at very early universe .",
    "here we have investigated the effect of running couplings on the curvature invariant as the seed for initial perturbations , by deriving the improved mukhanov  sassaki equation .",
    "we saw that this can be solved iteratively .",
    "the gravitational coupling is almost constant in the radiation and matter dominated era and thus the transfer function of perturbations to the power spectrum is not improved .",
    "we obtained the improved power spectrum and observed that it is slightly improved for large wave numbers .",
    "this means that the tail of the predicted power spectrum comes more closer to the observed data .    c. kiefer , _ quantum gravity _ , oxford university press ( 2007 ) .",
