    "extensive theoretical and experimental work has been devoted to the study of amorphous alloys of rare earths and transition metals , for instance tbfe@xmath7 and yfe@xmath7 .",
    "they are modeled @xcite by a heisenberg hamiltonian with random uniaxial single - site anisotropy defined on a simple cubic lattice , or , in short , by the random - anisotropy model ( ram ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a three - component spin variable , @xmath2 is a unit vector describing the local ( spatially uncorrelated ) random anisotropy , and @xmath10 the anisotropy strength . in amorphous alloys",
    "the distribution of @xmath2 is isotropic , since , in the absence of crystalline order , there is no preferred direction .",
    "random anisotropy is a relevant perturbation of the pure heisenberg model , the crossover exponent being @xcite @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , random - anisotropy systems show a behavior that is different from that observed in pure heisenberg systems .",
    "even though the critical behavior of the ram has been investigated at length in the last thirty years ( see @xcite for a review ) we do not have yet a satisfactory picture of its critical behaviour . the imry - ma argument @xcite forbids the presence of a low - temperature phase with nonvanishing magnetization for @xmath12 .",
    "however , this does not exclude the appearance of a glass transition with a low - temperature phase characterized by quasi - long - range order ( qlro ) , i.e. , a phase in which correlation functions decay algebraically @xcite .",
    "functional renormalization - group calculations @xcite indicate that qlro may set in for small values of @xmath10 , in agreement with a landau - ginzburg calculation @xcite of the equation of state for @xmath13 . in the opposite limit @xmath14",
    "the ram hamiltonian reduces to that of an ising spin glass with a correlated bond distribution . indeed , for @xmath15",
    "one can write @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an ising spin , and obtain the hamiltonian @xmath18 we call this model strong random - anisotropy model ( sram ) ( we set @xmath19 without loss of generality ) . model ( [ raminfd ] ) differs from the usual ising spin glass model ( isgm ) in the bond distribution : in hamiltonian ( [ raminfd ] ) the random variables @xmath20 on different lattice links are correlated .",
    "for instance , one has @xmath21 , where the product is over the links belonging to a given plaquette and the average is taken with respect to the distribution of the vectors @xmath2 .",
    "an interesting hypothesis , originally put forward in @xcite , is that the sram transition is in the same universality class as that of the isgm .",
    "this conjecture looks very plausible , since the sram is nothing but an ising model with local disorder and frustration . in some sense",
    "we can think of the sram and of the isgm as two different versions of the same model : in the sram disorder is associated with lattice sites , while in the isgm disorder is associated with lattice bonds .",
    "they are analogous to the site - diluted and bond - diluted ising model @xcite , whose hamiltonian is given by ( [ raminfd ] ) with @xmath22 ( site dilution ) and @xmath23 ( bond dilution ) , @xmath24 being a random variable such that @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) with probability @xmath27 ( resp .",
    "@xmath28 ) . note that the site - diluted model can also be interpreted as a bond - diluted model with a correlated bond distribution , exactly as is the case for the sram .",
    "nonetheless , there is little doubt  though a satisfactory numerical check is still missing  that the two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "note that the sram is less frustrated than the standard isgm , since in the sram @xmath21 .",
    "this fact does not rule out the conjecture since it is known that maximal frustration is not necessary to obtain glassy behaviour .",
    "for instance , the random - bond ising model with @xmath29 with probability @xmath27 and @xmath30 with probability @xmath28 has a glassy low - temperature phase for @xcite @xmath31 .",
    "the identity of the sram and isgm universality classes was confirmed in two dimensions by a renormalization - group calculation using the large - cell method @xcite , though in this case the critical point is at @xmath32 . in three dimensions instead",
    ", the critical behaviour of the sram has been controversial for a long time . while , for small @xmath10 , numerical simulations @xcite provided some evidence of the existence of a finite - temperature transition ( though qlro was never observed ) , in the sram even the existence of a finite - temperature transition was in doubt @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we study again the sram and find good evidence for the existence of a finite - temperature transition .",
    "the corresponding critical behaviour turns out to be compatible with the conjecture of @xcite .",
    "note that at the transition only the overlap variables , which are the usual order parameters at a spin - glass transition , become critical .",
    "magnetic quantities do not show any critical behaviour , though we expect nonanalyticities induced by the critical modes .",
    "thus , on both sides of the transition the system is paramagnetic .",
    "it is unknown whether this paramagnetic phase survives up to @xmath32 .",
    "note that our results predict an isgm transition also in a generalized sram in which the vectors @xmath33 are @xmath34 dimensional , for @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , as @xmath34 increases , the bond correlation decreases and , for @xmath36 , one reobtains the isgm although with a nonstandard bond distribution . for @xmath37 instead a _",
    "ferromagnetic _ phase transition would be possible since the system is less frustrated than the case we have considered .",
    "note that such a transition would only be observed in correlations of @xmath38 , where the ising variables @xmath39 should be chosen such as to have the couplings @xmath40 ferromagnetic on a maximal set of lattice links .",
    "this ferromagnetic transition would not violate the imry - ma argument , since order in the @xmath41 variables does not imply order in the continuous variables @xmath9 .",
    "most likely , as for @xmath42 , the low - temperature phase would still be paramagnetic even if some ising variables magnetize .",
    "a question that remains open is the behaviour of the ram for finite anisotropy @xmath10 .",
    "if there is indeed a low - temperature phase with qlro for small @xmath10 as predicted in @xcite , then there should be a critical value @xmath43 such that isgm behaviour is observed only for @xmath44 .",
    "nothing is known about @xmath43 and we can not even exclude that @xmath45 , so that isgm behaviour is observed only for model ( [ raminfd ] ) .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we study the critical behaviour of the sram by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . since the model is essentially a spin glass we focus on the so - called overlap variables @xmath46 , where @xmath41 and @xmath47 are associated with two different replicas of the model with the same bond variables . for",
    "the sram one can also consider the standard magnetic variables @xmath48 .",
    "we find , in agreement with the results of @xcite , that these quantities are not critical , i.e. on the low - temperature side of the transition the system is still paramagnetic .",
    "we study the behaviour of the sram in the high - temperature phase .",
    "this reduces the algorithmic problems  the mc algorithm becomes very slow as temperature is reduced  and allows us to consider lattices of size @xmath3 up to @xmath49 . for the mc dynamics , we combine the metropolis algorithm with the random - exchange ( parallel - tempering ) method @xcite .    in order to verify whether the system has a critical behaviour , we looked for the occurence of finite - size scaling ( fss ) . for this purpose",
    ", we considered the ratios @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( both quantities are associated with the two - point function of the overlap variables ) , fixing @xmath53 . if fss holds , as @xmath54 increases all points should eventually fall on a universal curve depending on @xmath55 . our results , reported in figures [ chi ] , [ xi ] , show that this happens : the data corresponding to the pairs @xmath56 , @xmath57 are only slightly different from those with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , the difference being much less than that observed by comparing data with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the data strongly suggest that fss holds , ( though , for @xmath62 , scaling corrections are significant ) and therefore , that the system becomes eventually critical . at the critical point @xmath63",
    ". looking at fig .",
    "[ xi ] we see that all mc data satisfy @xmath64 , which indicates that they all lie in the high - temperature phase .",
    "this allows us to set a lower bound on the position of the critical point , @xmath65 .    in order to determine the critical properties of the model , i.e. critical point and critical exponents",
    ", we used the iterative method which was introduced in @xcite and generalized in @xcite to include scaling corrections .",
    "it allowed us to obtain infinite - volume estimates of @xmath66 and @xmath52 up to @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the infinite - volume second - moment correlation length ) in the high - temperature phase .",
    "the starting point is the fss relation @xmath69 valid for any long - distance quantity . here",
    "@xmath70 is an arbitrary number ( in our calculations we fixed @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are universal scaling functions , and @xmath74 is a to - be - determined correction - to - scaling exponent . by iterating ( [ fss - corr ] )",
    "it is possible to extrapolate the finite - volume estimates @xmath75 , obtaining the infinite - volume value @xmath76 .     for @xmath71.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]     for @xmath71.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    our results show that @xmath77 increases quite rapidly in the range we have studied , @xmath78 , confirming that the system eventually becomes critical . fitting the infinite - volume results , we are able to determine the critical point and critical exponents associated with the critical behaviour of the overlap observables . we obtain : @xmath79",
    "the critical exponents are defined by @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the suffix @xmath82 is introduced to remind that they refer to the overlap variables and not to the magnetic ones . in the analysis it is crucial to include corrections to scaling in the fss ( corrections behave as @xmath83 ) and in fits of infinite - volume quantities ( corrections behave as @xmath84 as @xmath85 ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath74 was determined by studying the critical behaviour of two universal ratios that involve the four - point and the two - point correlation function of the overlap variables .",
    "we obtained @xmath86 .",
    "estimates ( [ results ] ) are close to those obtained for the isgm and thus support the conjecture that the sram transition is in the same universality class as that of the isgm .",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath87 , @xmath88 , while @xcite reports @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "other estimates are reported in table 1 of @xcite . with the quoted error bars",
    "there is a small discrepancy between our estimate of @xmath91 and those of @xcite .",
    "this difference should not be taken too seriously , since there are similar discrepancies among the estimates obtained by different groups for the bimodal isgm , see table 1 of @xcite .     for several lattice sizes.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]     for several lattice sizes.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in mc simulations the critical point is often determined by considering the crossing point @xmath92 of the binder cumulant @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , or of the ratio @xmath95 : indeed , @xmath96 as @xmath97 .",
    "our data for @xmath98 and @xmath95 , which are reported in figures [ biq ] and [ xil ] , are compatible with @xmath99 . indeed ,",
    "the estimates of both @xmath98 and @xmath95 at fixed @xmath54 get closer as @xmath100 increases towards 1.08 , although a crossing point is not clearly observed for those values of @xmath54 ( @xmath101 ) that extend up to @xmath102 .",
    "this is probably due to scaling corrections that are particularly large in the sram .",
    "we can perform a more quantitative check by using the results of @xcite for the critical - point values @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "they quote : @xmath105 ( bimodal distribution ) and @xmath106 ( gaussian distribution ) ; @xmath107 ( bimodal distribution ) and @xmath108 ( gaussian distribution ) .",
    "these results are compatible with ours for @xmath98 and @xmath95 close to @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath110 we have @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , @xmath113 ( @xmath56 ) , and @xmath114 ( @xmath112 ) , @xmath115 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "these results are very close to the isgm estimates and show the correct trend .",
    "they are therefore consistent with the existence of a critical point at @xmath116 and with the conjecture that the isgm and the sram belong to the same universality class .",
