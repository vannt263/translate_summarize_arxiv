    "the dynamics of dirac fermions in a 2 + 1 dimensional conical space - time @xcite or in the presence of a cosmic string @xcite exhibits a variety of rich nonperturbative quantum features . in spite of strong theoretical interest ,",
    "the quantum properties of such 2d fermionic systems are difficult to observe in the laboratory .",
    "the experimental fabrication of monolayer graphene in 2004 @xcite , whose low energy excitations behave like negatively charged fermions satisfying a two dimensional dirac equation @xcite , offers new possibilities to study the effect of topological defects in such lower dimensional fermionic systems @xcite .",
    "the dirac type excitations in pristine graphene are gapless",
    ". however , various impurities , electron - electron interactions , substrate structures and other short distance effects can violate the sublattice symmetry in graphene , leading to a mass gap which has attracted both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention .",
    "thus , the gapped graphene system provides a unique template to study the nonperturbative quantum features of massive dirac fermions in the presence of a topological defect .    in graphene the fermi velocity @xmath0 , which is approximately 300 times smaller than the velocity of light .",
    "consequently , a relatively small external coulomb charge impurity @xmath1 leads to strong nonperturbative electric field effects in graphene @xcite . in a gapped graphene system",
    ", the external coulomb charge is said to reach the critical value when the system dives into the negative energy continuum @xcite and quantum instability sets in .",
    "any given external charge in gapped graphene can therefore be classified as either sub or super critical .",
    "these two different regimes are characterized by markedly different behaviour of the observables such as the local density of states ( ldos ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall study the combined effect of a conical topological defect and an external coulomb charge impurity on the low energy quantum dynamics of quasiparticles in gapped graphene .",
    "when a cone is formed from a graphene sheet , the topological defect introduced in the system gives rise to some nontrivial holonomies @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions associated with the holonomies can be realized by introducing a suitable flux tube , analogous to a cosmic string , passing through the origin @xcite . in our analysis , such a flux tube shall be used to model the conical topological defect on the 2d graphene sheet .",
    "let us now consider the effect of an external coulomb charge impurity in such a system , whose strength could be either subcritical or supercritical .",
    "for a subcritical coulomb charge impurity in the presence of the flux tube , we shall show that the quantization of the gapped graphene system is not unique and an additional parameter is required to fully characterize the boundary conditions at the origin . in order to understand the physical meaning of such a boundary condition , recall that the dirac description in graphene is valid for low energy or long wavelength excitations .",
    "on the other hand , the topological defect as well as the coulomb charge can lead to additional short range interactions , which can not be incorporated as dynamical terms in the dirac equation .",
    "the combined effect of the short range interactions due to the topological defect and the coulomb charge impurity can however be encoded in the boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "if we further impose the natural requirement that the graphene system conserves probability and the time evolution is unitary , then all the allowed boundary conditions can be labelled by a single real parameter .",
    "this leads to a one parameter quantization of the gapped graphene system , analogous to what was obtained for dirac fermions in 2 + 1 dimensional gravity with a topological defect @xcite . for the gapped graphene system",
    ", we show that the experimental observables such as the ldos , phase shifts and the bound state energies depend explicitly on the new parameter that labels the allowed boundary conditions .    for a supercritical value of the charge impurity in the presence of the topological defect , we study the system with a regularized coulomb potential and also with a zigzag edge boundary condition .",
    "the regularization of the coulomb potential takes care of the finite size of the external charge impurity and allows the bound states of the system to dive into the negative energy continuum@xcite . the critical charge in gapped graphene cone is renormalized to a value higher than that of the gapless case and the value depends on the gap , the cut off parameter , the topology of the system and also on the boundary conditions used to obtain the quasibound state spectra in the supercritical region .",
    "it will be shown that with the increase in gap or cut off parameter the critical charge in presence of zigzag edge boundary condition increases more rapidly than in presence of a regularized coulomb potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we set up the dirac equation for gapped graphene cone with a point charge at the apex .",
    "this is followed by the analysis of the spectrum in the subcritical region , where we obtain the scattering phase shifts , bound state energies and local density of states ( ldos ) and show how these physical quantities depend explicitly on the sample topology .",
    "then we discuss the effect of generalized boundary conditions on the spectrum . in the next section",
    "the analysis of the corresponding spectrum is done in the supercritical region with a regularized coulomb potential and with zigzag edge boundary condition .",
    "we end this paper with some discussion and outlook .",
    "graphene has a hexagonal honeycomb lattice structure which is formed by two inter penetrating triangular sublattices @xcite @xmath2 and @xmath3 . assuming only nearest neighbour hopping in graphene and parameterizing the energy difference between the sublattices by @xmath4 we have the hamiltonian as @xcite @xmath5\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath6.\\ ] ] here @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are the creation and destruction operators for electrons localized on sites @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the vectors @xmath12 connect one @xmath2 sublattice point to its three neighbouring @xmath3 sublattice points .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath13 is related to the probability amplitude for electron transfer between neighbouring sites@xcite .",
    "though for an ideal single layer graphene @xmath14 , by breaking the sublattice symmetry a gap can be introduced in graphene@xcite and in our following work we shall consider the massive dirac excitations of a gapped graphene cone .    from the hamiltonian @xmath15",
    "we obtain that in gapped graphene the energy eigenvalues are minimum at the six vertices of the first brillouin zone of graphene and they are known as the dirac points . among these points ,",
    "two are inequivalent @xcite .",
    "we consider them to be situated at the opposite corners of the brillouin zone and we denote their wave vectors by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus we can construct the four linearly independent energy eigenstates @xcite of the hopping hamiltonian denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the pseudospin indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the eigenstates correspond to that sublattice on which the wavefunction has nonzero amplitude and the valley indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the eigenstates are distinguished by the manner in which the phase of the wavefunction evolves around a lattice site having zero amplitude wavefunction @xcite ( see fig.[fig : eigenstates ] ) .",
    "it can also be seen from fig.[fig : eigenstates ] that the states with valley index @xmath21 can be produced by rotating the corresponding states with valley index @xmath20 by @xmath22@xcite .",
    "the basis is chosen in such a manner that @xmath23 .",
    "the low energy eigenstates in graphene can be expressed as a linear combination of these energy eigenstates multiplied by envelope functions varying slowly on the lattice parameter scale .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from fig.([fig:4 ] )",
    "we can observe that the bound state energy spectra and the probability amplitude of the wavefunction gets affected by the boundary conditions though their nature remains same .",
    "like the critical charge obtained for regularized coulomb potential , here also with zigzag edge boundary condition we can see that the mass affects the critical charge of the system .",
    "proceeding as before in this case we have @xmath33}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here also from equation ( [ g12 ] ) we can see when @xmath34 which agrees with the result obtained for massless case @xcite .",
    "the dependence of critical charge on the nonzero mass and cutoff parameter has been shown for different opening angles of the gapped graphene cone .",
    "also we have compared the dependence for two different boundary conditions .        from fig.([fig:5 ] ) we can see that for a zigzag edge boundary condition the critical charge vary with @xmath35 more rapidly than it varies for a regularized coulomb potential .",
    "thus the two different boundary conditions affect the dependence of critical charge of a gapped graphene cone on @xmath35 .",
    "in this paper we have described the low energy dynamics of massive dirac fermions in a gapped graphene cone in the presence of an external coulomb charge impurity .",
    "the graphene cone can be equivalently described as a graphene plane together with a flux tube whose gauge potential is chosen to produce the required holonomies .",
    "the given system thus consists of a gapped graphene plane together with a combination of a coulomb charge impurity and a flux tube passing through it .",
    "the strength of the coulomb charge can be sub or supercritical .    the combination of this topological defect as well as the charge impurity results in short distance interactions , the effect of which can not be incorporated as dynamical terms in the dirac equation , valid in the low energy limit . for a sub critical charge impurity ,",
    "we show that the effect of these interactions can be modelled through appropriate choice of boundary conditions , which are determined by imposing the requirement of a unitary time evolution .",
    "while there is a very large class of allowed boundary conditions , it turns out that they can be labelled by a single real parameter .",
    "it is this parameter through which the effect of the short range interactions enter in the analysis presented here .",
    "this parameter can not be determined from theory alone .",
    "however , we have shown that the observables such as ldos , scattering phase shifts and bound state energies depend explicitly on this parameter .",
    "as mentioned before , a similar situation arose in the context of dirac fermions in a plane in the presence of a cosmic string .",
    "these two situations are not identical , but similar quantum subtleties arise in both contexts and the case of the gapped graphene considered here is more amenable to empirical analysis .",
    "the supercritical regime of the external coulomb charge is characterized by quantum instabilities .",
    "here we have analyzed the effect of topological defects in the supercritical dynamics of gapped graphene .",
    "this problem has been analyzed with a regularized coulomb potential as well as with a zigzag boundary condition .",
    "we have shown that the quasibound state spectra and the probability amplitude depend explicitly on the number of sectors removed from a planar graphene to form the cone .",
    "in addition , the running of the critical charge as a function of the product of the dirac mass @xmath36 and the cutoff parameter @xmath37 has been obtained .",
    "though the nature of the dependence is similar for both the regularized coulomb potential and the zigzag boundary condition but in the latter case the critical charge increases more rapidly with @xmath35 than the former case ."
