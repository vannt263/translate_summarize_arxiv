    "in condensed matter physics , one fundamental issue is to determine whether the low - energy behavior of some correlated electron system can be described by the conventional fermi liquid ( fl ) theory @xcite . in a normal fl ,",
    "the fermionic quasiparticles have a long lifetime and exhibit weak damping effect .",
    "to measure the strength of fermion damping , one needs to consider the fermion damping rate @xmath1 is the imaginary part of retarded fermion self - energy function .",
    "the fermions are expected to have a long lifetime if @xmath2 vanishes more rapidly than @xmath3 as the fermi surface is approached , namely @xmath4 in most cases , the fermion damping rate can be formally written as a power - law @xmath5 . to judge",
    "whether fl theory works , one needs to compute the quasiparticle residue @xmath6 where the real part of retarded fermion self - energy @xmath7 relates to @xmath8 via the kramers - kronig ( kk ) relationship .",
    "one can verify that @xmath9 takes certain finite value for @xmath10 , which implies that the fl theory is valid .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath11 , the residue @xmath12 , and we have a non - fl ( nfl ) . the case of @xmath13 represents a minimal violation of fl theory and thus defines a marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) @xcite , which is widely used to account for the observed unusual normal state of optimally doped high-@xmath14 cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) ordinary metal , the elementary fermionic excitations can be well described by the fl theory @xcite .",
    "the validity of the fl description relies crucially on the fact that the long - range coulomb interaction amongst fermions is screened by the collective particle - hole excitations and as such becomes short - ranged .",
    "specifically , the bare coulomb interaction behaves as @xmath15 in 3d metals , but is modified by static screening to @xmath16 , where the screening factor @xmath17 is determined by the zero - energy density of states ( dos ) @xmath18 .",
    "perturbative calculations @xcite show that the fermion damping rate depends on @xmath3 in the form @xmath19 , which vanishes rapidly as @xmath20 and renders the applicability of conventional fl description .",
    "semimetals @xcite are different from normal metals in that their fermi surface shrinks to zero - dimensional points , at which the valence and conduction bands touch each other .",
    "the fermion dos vanishes at the fermi point , namely @xmath21 , thus the coulomb interaction remains long - ranged and might invalidate the fl description .",
    "this issue has been extensively studied in graphene by means of various techniques @xcite .",
    "earlier perturbative calculations found that the damping rate of dirac fermions @xmath2 displays a linear dependence on @xmath3 , which suggests a mfl behavior @xcite .",

    "we notice that the physical effects of long - range coulomb interaction on double- and triple - weyl fermions have recently been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "it was found that coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant in double- and triple - weyl semimetals .",
    "these works are technically based on the instantaneous approximation for the coulomb interaction .",
    "we emphasize that , in order to precisely compute @xmath0 and fermion damping rate , the dynamical screening needs to be properly taken into account .",
    "moreover , the validity of fl theory can not be simply determined by the marginal irrelevance of coulomb interaction .",
    "even a marginally irrelevant coulomb interaction is able to induce nontrivial low - energy properties .",
    "for instance , the coulomb interaction is known to be marginally irrelevant in both 2d dirac semimetal @xcite and 2d semi - dirac semimetal @xcite .",
    "however , it has distinct physical effects in these two materials : @xmath9 flows to a finite value at low energies in the former material , but vanishes in the latter .",
    "apparently , the fermion dispersion plays a vital role , and a more careful theoretical investigation is necessary .",
    "concerning the methodology , ordinary perturbative expansion method is not a suitable tool to compute the fermion damping rate and residue .",
    "rg method is more appropriate since it naturally produces the energy dependence of all the model parameters . in this paper , we shall make use of the rg approach in combination with @xmath27 expansion , where @xmath28 is the fermion flavor . to get a quantitatively more precise fermion self - energy , we go beyond the instantaneous approximation and incorporate the energy dependence of coulomb interaction by including the dynamical polarization function .",
    "we shall derive the rg equations for all the model parameters , and then extract some useful physical quantities from the solutions of rg equations .",
    "our main conclusion is that the fl theory breaks down in both double- and triple - weyl semimetals as the residue @xmath29 in the lowest energy limit .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0 flows to zero more slowly than a logarithmic decay , signalling a smaller - than - mfl deviation of the conventional fl description .    on the experimental side ,",
    "our rg analysis would shed light on the exploration of anomalous violation of fl theory in some real materials .",

    "after solving the rg equations for all the model parameters , we have found a new type of state that invalidates fl theory in an anomalous way , in which the residue @xmath0 flows to zero very slowly in the lowest energy limit and the fermion damping is weaker than a rigorous mfl .",
    "such state provides a weaker deviation of conventional fl theory than mfl .    in a recent work ,",
    "we have investigated the strong coupling between the gapless nodal fermions and the critical quantum fluctuation of nematic order parameter inside the superconducting dome of cuprates @xcite . in that case",
    ", the residue @xmath0 also flows to zero at a very low speed , similar to the anomalous violation of fl theory predicted in this paper .",
    "since the cuprate samples are often not sufficiently clean , it would be practically difficult to probe such an anomalous nfl state in experiments .",
    "in contrast , it would be technically easier to prepare clean double- and triple - weyl semimetal samples .",
    "we therefore expect future arpes experiments @xcite could be performed to detect the non - standard nfl behaviors in these two types of material .",
    "another interesting possibility is that a finite gap might be dynamically generated at the band - touching point by a sufficiently strong coulomb interaction .",
    "this would lead to a semimetal - insulator quantum phase transition @xcite and a series of intriguing quantum critical phenomena @xcite . since the coulomb interaction plays a significant role over a wide range of energy scales",

    "<S> the influence of long - range coulomb interaction on three - dimensional double- and triple - weyl fermions is analyzed by means of renormalization group method after incorporating the dynamical screening effect caused by the collective particle - hole excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the quasiparticle residue @xmath0 of these two types of fermions vanishes in the lowest energy limit , indicating the violation of fermi liquid description . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , @xmath0 flows to zero at low energies more slowly than a marginal fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the interaction - induced fermion damping effect is weaker than a marginal fermi liquid </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the double- and triple - weyl semimetals exhibit anomalous violation of the conventional fermi liquid theory , which might be probed by such experimental apparatus as angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . </S>"
