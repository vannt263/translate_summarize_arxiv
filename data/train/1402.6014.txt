    "after all the angles in the lepton mixing matrix @xcite and the mass squared differences of neutrinos are determined by the atmospheric , the solar , the reactor , as well as the accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments , we have entered into a new phase of neutrino physics  @xcite",
    ". of course , we are still with the important unknowns in the lepton sector , cp violating phase of the kobayashi - maskawa type  @xcite and the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "yet , we do have relatively clearer view of how these questions are to be settled , either through the ongoing searches , or by new measurement to be carried out by the powerful apparatus described in various experimental proposals to date .",
    "it is quite possible that even after these unknown quantities are measured by experiments the questions of somewhat different category will still remain : what are the absolute masses of neutrinos ?",
    "are neutrinos dirac or majorana particles ? if majorana , which values of the majorana cp phases @xcite are chosen by nature ? the first one , knowing the absolute mass scale , is crucial to understand physics behind the origin of neutrino mass , and the latter two are likely the key to understand baryon number asymmetry in the universe @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on detectability of the majorana cp phase in the light of informations to be obtained by cosmological observation and neutrino experiments in the coming precision era .",
    "in particular , in the near future the double beta decay experiments aim to cover entire region of parameters allowed by the inverted mass ordering , ( @xmath4 ) . ]",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : m0nbb - m0 ] .",
    "we show that given the future perspective , when combined with precision measurement in cosmology , one can indeed expect some sensitivities , though limited ones , to one of the phases ( denoted as @xmath1 , see section  [ subsec : double - beta ] ) .",
    "we hope that this result can trigger renewed interests in the problem of detectability of the majorana phase despite the dominant pessimism which prevailed in the past decades .",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the foregoing efforts which examined the sensitivity to the majorana phase .",
    "we feel that the present moment is the particularly right time to revisit these issues because of the following reasons .",
    "firstly , cosmological observations entered into the precision era so that their data became sensitive to the absolute masses of neutrinos better than the current bounds from laboratory experiments , as seen most notably by the results obtained by the planck collaboration  @xcite . see also ref .",
    "@xcite for overview and many relevant references .",
    "it makes us possible to employ a new strategy that the absolute neutrino mass scale can be constrained mainly by cosmology and we can use data of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments , with supplementary use of single beta decay data , to constrain the majorana phases of neutrinos . even more interestingly a discrepancy between the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and lensing observations about cluster correlations would prefer massive neutrinos with mass of a few tenth of ev @xcite . if confirmed , it would make the basis of our analysis more robust .",
    "secondly , as mentioned above , several new neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are in line to measure or constrain , the `` ee '' element of neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis , so called the effective majorana mass , to a few tens of mev  @xcite . for reviews and description of the other projects ,",
    "see e.g. , refs .",
    "needless to say , they are the prime candidates among various experiments that can measure or constrain the majorana phases .",
    "we should also note that intensive efforts have been devoted in order to improve the calculations of the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) which is crucial to determine the value of effective majorana mass from the measured half life time in double beta decay experiments  @xcite .",
    "see , also ref .",
    "@xcite for review of the recent progress in the calculations of nme .",
    "thirdly , the uncertainties in the relevant lepton mixing angles get decreased dramatically recently .",
    "the error of @xmath5 is now only @xmath6@xcite , and moreover it will be decreased to a sub - percent level by the future medium - baseline reactor experiments  @xcite . the mixing angle @xmath7 whose value was unknown until recently before intriguing indication from t2k  @xcite by @xmath8 appearance events , is now precisely measured @xcite .",
    "the error of @xmath9 will soon reach to a even greater precision , @xmath10 level .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : m0nbb - m0 ] which shows how small is the effect of the current uncertainties of the mixing parameters onto the allowed regions by double beta decay experiments .",
    "these developments are important to tighten up the constraint on majorana cp phases and to place it on a firmer ground .",
    "in addition , the single beta decay experiment katrin @xcite ( see also @xcite ) will constrain neutrino masses to a level of 0.2 ev at 90 % cl , or observe the effects consistent with masses of this order , in a manner quite complementary to cosmological observations . while enjoying the above new inputs ,",
    "our analysis is nothing but a continuation of the numerous similar analyses attempted by the many authors , from which we are certainly benefited .    to display the sensitivities to the majorana cp phases in a global way",
    ", we use in this paper the cp exclusion fraction @xmath11 @xcite , which is defined as a fraction of the cp phase space that can be excluded at a certain cl for a given set of input parameters .",
    "we believe that it is a useful tool particularly in the initial era of search for effects of the majorana cp phase , in which even the partial exclusion of allowed range of the phase would be very valuable .",
    "has intimate connection to the error of cp phase , an appropriate measure in precision measurement era , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "it suggests that the cp exclusion fraction can be a universally usable measure for cp sensitivity . ] in @xcite @xmath11 was used to display sensitivity to the lepton kobayashi - maskawa phase achievable in the ongoing long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . for earlier discussion of a cp sensitivity measure closely related to @xmath11 see @xcite .    in the following two sections , [ sec : observables ] and [ sec : analytic - estimation ] , we briefly review the basic features of the observables used and describe simple analytic estimation of the effects of majorana phases .",
    "the expert readers must go directly to the analysis results given in sections  [ sec : why ] and [ sec : results - exclusion - fraction ] , starting from describing the analysis method in section  [ sec : analysis - method ] .",
    "in this work we assume that the neutrinos are majorana particles , and their majorana masses are the unique source of neutrinoless double beta decay . we also assume the standard three - flavor mixing scheme of neutrinos . in our analysis we consider the following three observables @xcite :    1 .   the effective neutrino mass measured by neutrinoless double beta ( hereafter denoted as @xmath12 ) decay experiment @xmath13 2 .   the sum of the three neutrino masses which can be determined by cosmological observation @xmath14 3 .   the effective neutrino mass measured by single beta decay experiment @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ,   \\label{eq : mass - beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are neutrino masses and @xmath18 @xmath19 are the element of electron - row of the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "we use its standard parameterization with notations @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite , whereas @xmath1 and @xmath22 denote the majorana cp phases , in which we have redefined @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( 14.82 ) in @xcite as @xmath22 for simplicity .",
    "all the three observables above are sensitive to masses of neutrinos , but they display different dependences on the mixing parameters , which makes them complementary to each other to detect the absolute mass scale . from the viewpoint of exploring the majorana phase , @xmath24 and",
    "the other two play different roles under the assumed errors taken in our analysis .",
    "of course , the information on majorana phase is contained only in @xmath24 , but the constraint on the absolute mass scale from the other two is indispensable to produce sensitivity to the phase , as we will see clearly in section  [ sec : why ] .",
    "the latter two are also complementary to each other .",
    "cosmological measurement of @xmath25 , though it may achieve greater accuracy in the future , relies on the assumption that we understand the rest of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "no such assumption is necessary for beta decay measurement in the laboratories as far as they can reach the neutrino mass scale given by nature .    in the rest of this section , after briefly mentioning their current status , we discuss some relevant issues on them in relationship to our analysis in this paper .      the rate of @xmath12 decay , or the inverse of the half life time @xmath26 of the @xmath12 decay , is related to the effective neutrino mass @xmath24 in ( [ eq:0nubb-1 ] ) as @xmath27^{-1 } = g_{0\\nu } \\left|{\\cal{m}}^{(0\\nu)}\\right|^2   \\left ( \\frac{m_{0\\nu\\beta\\beta}}{m_e}\\right)^2 ,   \\label{eq : decay - rate}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the electron mass , @xmath29 is the kinematic phase space factor , which can be calculated very accurately @xcite , while @xmath30 is the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) corresponding to the @xmath12 transition which is largely uncertain .",
    "the next generation @xmath31 decay search aims at reaching the region of @xmath24 to @xmath32 mev , which cover the entire inverted mass ordering branch .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m0nbb - m0 ] . ) toward approaching to the goal , the ongoing experiments are improving the lower bound of @xmath12 decay lifetime . using @xmath33ge nuclei",
    "gerda obtained the limit @xmath34 years at 90% cl , which is translated into the upper bound on @xmath24 of the range @xmath35 ev depending upon the nme used @xcite .",
    "kamland - zen @xcite and exo-200 @xcite , both using @xmath36xe , derived the bound on lifetime @xmath37",
    "( 90% cl ) and @xmath38 ( 90% cl ) years , respectively .",
    "the latter bound becomes less stringent than the previously reported one from exo-200 @xcite because they found 9.9 events consistent with the @xmath39 decay signal . a joint analysis of kamland - zen and the previous exo-200 results are carried out by the kamland - zen group who obtained a bound @xmath40 ( 90% cl ) @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the upper limit of the effective mass @xmath41 .",
    "the largest uncertainty in translating the bounds on @xmath26 to that of @xmath24 comes from the uncertainty of the nme , @xmath30 .",
    "currently , it produces differences of a factor of @xmath42 on @xmath24 for a given measured lifetime @xmath26 . despite",
    "that extensive efforts have been devoted to this issue , there are still considerable differences among nme values obtained by different authors and by different calculation methods . generally speaking",
    ", the difference between different authors is not very large if the same calculation technique is used .",
    "the best hope would be to normalize the coupling strength by using the @xmath43 decay by which the difference may go down to @xmath44 level , as proposed within the framework of quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) method @xcite .",
    "but , notable difference persists to among results calculated by different techniques .",
    "we expect that once the positive signal of @xmath12 will be observed by using different isotopes , by comparing the real data from these different isotopes , it would be possible to check the validity of various theoretical calculations based on different models or methods in a systematic way , which should allow to reduce significantly the nme uncertainty . for this reason we consider uncertainty on the nme a factor of less than or equal to 2 in this paper .    recently , it was pointed out that renormalization effect on the axial vector coupling constant in the nuclear medium can have a sizable impact on the relationship between @xmath24 and half life @xcite .",
    "it is likely that it affects the analysis which aims at detecting the effects of the majorana phase such as ours in an @xmath45-dependent manner , and it is important to discuss influence of the effect .",
    "unfortunately , we can not address this issue in this paper because of the simplicity of our @xmath46 construction .",
    "the recent high precision cosmological observation became sensitive to the sum of the neutrino masses @xmath25 defined in ( [ eq : sigma - def ] ) .",
    "with baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data the planck collaboration obtained their most stringent limit @xmath47 at 95% cl  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a stronger bound , @xmath48 at 95% cl , by adding the large - scale matter power spectrum data from the wigglez dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "more recently , some analyses started to favor non - zero best fit value of @xmath25  @xcite of active or sterile neutrinos .",
    "there exists some tension between strength of cluster correlations determined by cmb and the lensing observations within the planck data itself as well as including other data sets .",
    "one of the ways to reduce the tension is to introduce neutrino masses .",
    "the authors of @xcite , assuming the active neutrinos , obtained the best fit value @xmath49 ev , which implies that @xmath50 ev in the three flavour scheme .",
    "we expect that the issue is to be resolved in future cosmological observation ; the data either from galaxy surveys or weak lensing by the euclid satellite , with planck constraints , may lead to the sensitivity to @xmath51 ev  @xcite .    despite the progress in tightening up the neutrino mass bound by cosmological observation and the great precision expected in the future",
    ", we should keep in mind that the analysis has done and needs to be done within a particular cosmological model .",
    "since neutrinos plays relatively minor role in determining the cmb spectrum and affecting the structure formation , we suspect that precision measurement of @xmath25 requires a well established framework describing our universe and its time evolution .",
    "therefore , as a prerequisite of our analysis in this paper , we assume that the _ standard model ( sm ) of cosmology _ is established at the time one can execute precision measurement of half - life of @xmath12 decay",
    ". it would not be the too optimistic to assume it because now already precise cosmological data by the planck and the other observations are well described by the @xmath52cdm model ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : sum - mass ] ) .",
    "the absolute neutrino mass scale can be probed by laboratory experiment which measures in a high precision electron energy spectrum at the end point in single beta decay @xcite .",
    "the effective neutrino mass @xmath53 measured by this method can be written as in ( [ eq : mass - beta ] ) .",
    "currently , the best upper bound on @xmath53 comes from mainz  @xcite and troitsk  @xcite experiments which place the upper bound @xmath54 ev and @xmath55 ev , respectively , both at 95% cl .",
    "in the near future , we expect that the bound will be improved by an order of magnitude by the katrin experiment @xcite which is expected to reach the sensitivity of @xmath56 0.2 ev at 90% cl .",
    "if the neutrino mass pattern is indeed the almost degenerate type , as suggested by some analyses of recent cosmological data @xcite , katrin has a chance of executing first model - independent determination of the absolute neutrino mass , and at the same time also serves for cross checking the cosmological measurement .",

    "it would allow us a reliable measurement of the neutrino component in the universe and to determine the sum of their masses with a sufficient robustness .",
    "the discussion in this paper would serve as a prototype of the similar analysis that should be done after we have acquired the established standard cosmological model .",
    "let us estimate the expected precision on @xmath24 to be observed in the @xmath12 decay experiment .",

    "( [ eq : decay - rate ] ) we obtain the following expression for the effective mass , @xmath243 the expected number of @xmath12 decays ( signal ) to be observed in the experiment , @xmath244 , is given by @xmath245 \\simeq   \\frac { \\varepsilon_{\\text{det } } n_a m_x t_{\\text{exp}}\\ln2}{w_x t_{1/2}^{0\\nu } } \\label{eq : n_decay}\\ ] ] where @xmath246 is the detection efficiency , @xmath247 and @xmath248 are respectively , the total mass and the molecular weight of the isotope @xmath249 to be used in the double beta decay experiment , @xmath250 is the avgadro s number and @xmath251 is the exposure time , assumed to be much smaller than @xmath26 .    on the other hand , the expected number of the background events can be expressed as , @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the number of background counts usually measured in kev@xmath254 kg @xmath254 yr@xmath255 , @xmath256 is the energy window ( @xmath257 energy resolution ) given in kev around the @xmath12 peak , both of which depend on the experimental set up we consider .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the expected sensitivity of the double beta decay experiment for the half life time is obtained when @xmath258 , which implies that @xmath259    this can be translated in terms of the minimum possible observable value of @xmath260 as  @xcite , @xmath261 ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left [ \\frac{b \\delta e } { m_x t_{\\text{exp}}}\\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{4}}.\\ ] ] if we consider , for example , the isotopes of @xmath33ge and @xmath36xe , by using the typical values for @xmath29 and @xmath30 found , e.g. , in ref .",

    "next let us consider the case that the background rate @xmath253 is so low that @xmath269 in eq .",

    ", from the number of observed events , @xmath244 , the half life time can be estimated as @xmath270 and its uncertainty is estimated as @xmath271 then from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m0nunu - nme ] ) and ( [ eq : delta - lifetime ] ) we obtain @xmath272 we note that the result does not depend on the life time , and the uncertainty can be arbitrarily small as we increase the product of the source mass and exposure time of the experiment by considering only the statistical error , until the point that the background could no longer be neglected .    by using the same numbers for @xmath29 and @xmath30 we used to obtain @xmath260 in eqs .",

    ". therefore , as long as the background is neglected , by considering the @xmath257 1 ton size experiment , it seems possible to reach the level of @xmath276 ev . in this work , for definiteness and simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath24 can be determined with an accuracy of 0.01 ev for a given reference value of the nme .",
    "see the section [ sec : analysis - procedure ] how to take into account the nme uncertainty .",
    "we note , however , that in reality , the fate of the background would not be so simple to allow analytic treatment as ours .",
    "therefore , most probably , one needs to perform detailed numerical simulations to reliably estimate the experimental uncertainties in measurement of the double beta decay lifetime .",
    "the authors thank kunio inoue for informative correspondences on neutrinoless double beta decay experiment and shun saito on the cosmological determination of neutrino masses .",
    "is grateful to cnpq for support for his visit to the departamento de fsica , pontifcia universidade catlica do rio de janeiro .",

    "after the first version of this paper @xcite was submitted to arxiv , a preprint  @xcite appeared which addresses the constraint on the majorana phase with the same framework of combining cosmological observations with @xmath12 decay experiments .",
    "it appears that a better sensitivity to the phase reported by them comes from the optimistic choice of uncertainties in @xmath12 decay measurement and in the nme , @xmath120 ev and @xmath277 , if translated to our language .",

    "<S> we illustrate the sensitivity under varying assumptions , from modest to optimistic ones , on experimental errors and theoretical uncertainty of nuclear matrix elements . assuming that the latter can be reduced to a factor of @xmath0 we find that one of the two majorana phases ( denoted as @xmath1 ) can be constrained by excluding @xmath2 of the phase space at @xmath3 cl even with the modest choice of experimental error for the lowest neutrino mass of 0.1 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic features of the sensitivity to @xmath1 , such as dependences on the true values of @xmath1 , are addressed . </S>"
