    "successful realization and studies of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) which establish a long - range and anisotropic interaction among particles , inaccessible to a short - range bec , bring new possibilities to explore novel quantum phase transitions ( see for review @xcite ) .",
    "ultracold dipolar gases have specially attracted much attention , including experiments on magnetic atoms @xcite , polar molecules @xcite , rydbergdressed atoms @xcite .",
    "ground - state and excited - state properties of such systems have also been extensively explored ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , exquisite experiments of @xmath0dy atoms made in stuttgart group @xcite have shown that when the condensate is quenched into a strong ddi regime , the system instead of collapsing @xcite , gets into a stable droplet crystal due to the quntum rosensweig instability @xcite .",
    "this state of matter is characterized by : ( i ) a large peak density that is only destroyed in a long time scale by three - body losses ( ii ) a decrease in the compressibility of the system @xcite . in the theoretical side ,",
    "two scenarios were performed to explain the stability of such droplets .",
    "the first one requires the presence of a large repulsive three - body interaction @xcite while in second technique , the instability can be halted by quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms provide an additional nonlinear term in the standard non - local gross - piteavskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "the ground - state properties , phase diagram and elementary excitations of such quantum droplets are studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that dipolar bec can be also considered as an ideal platfrom for realizing quantum self - bound droplets @xcite .",
    "most recently , the formation of a macro - droplet state in an ultracold bosonic gas of erbium atoms with strong dipolar interactions has been reported by the innsbruck team @xcite .",
    "note that the droplet phase has also been observed in liquid helium @xcite and in a bose - bose mixture with a pure contact interaction @xcite .",
    "however , up to now , there is a little or no evidence for the finite - temperature impact on this novel state of matter .",
    "it is convenient to remind that experiments actually take place at finite temperatures where the condensate coexists with the thermal cloud .",
    "effects of this latter become non - negligible as the temperature approaches to the transition and hence , may influence the dynamics and the thermodynamic of the dipolar droplet .",
    "furthermore , interactions between condensed and noncondensed particles may induce strong thermal fluctuations causing to depopulate the droplet .",
    "these thermal fluctuations play also a crucial role in the droplet lifetime .",
    "our goal in this paper is then to study , for the first time to our knowledge , the temperature dependence of the droplet state in a dipolar bec by profiting of the wealth of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov - popov ( hfbp ) theory relies on numerical simulations .",
    "this theory was used in several early studies to calculate the collective modes and to analyze the thermodynamic properties of both short range and dipolar bose gases ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the hfbp approximation which is gapless , allows us to revolutionize our understanding of droplets at nonzero temperatures since it treats the thermal fluctuations ( emerge naturally ) on the same footing as the quantum fluctuations . within the realm of the hfbp",
    ", we rigorously derive a generalized lee - huang - yang ( glhy ) @xcite corrected equation of state ( eos ) that describes self - consistently finite - temperature effects .",
    "we show that the inclusion of such glhy term in the extended gp equation exhibits more robust droplets notably at very low temperature .",
    "the reason is that the repulsive glhy correction adds a new extra term to the gp equation that significantly arrestes the dipolar collapse at high condensed density @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "[ 3bt ] , we will introduce the finite - temperature hfbp model for dipolar bec with two- and three - body interactions and confined in a cylindrically symetric harmonic trap . in sec.[unif ] , we look at excitations of homogenous gas and derive useful analytical expressions for the quantum and thermal fluctuations that depends on the two - body contact interaction , the ddi and the coupling constant of the three - body interaction . we demonstrate that the peculiar interplay of these quantities provides a glhy eos , and enhances the sound velocity , ground state energy , the compressibility and the superfluid fraction . in sec.[drop ] , we extend the glhy result to the inhomogeneous trap using local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we then deal with the effects of thermal fluctuations on the nucleation and the stability of droplets in a dipolar bose gas with dominated ddi at finite temperature by numerically solving the popov equation in the presence of glhy stabilization . the temperature dependence of particles number of the droplet will be also highlighted .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sec.[conc ] .",

    "<S> we systematically study the properties of dipolar bose gases with two- and three - body contact interactions at finite temperature using the hartree - fock - bogoliubov - popov approximation . in uniform case </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an exciting new extension of the seminal lee - huang - yang corrected equation of state that depends explicitly on the thermal fluctuations and on the coupling constant of the three - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , on the other hand , effects of the thermal fluctuations on the occurrence and the stabilization of a droplet state in a bose - einstein condensate with strong dipole - dipole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at finite temperature , the droplet phase appears as a narrow peak surrounded by a broader thermal halo . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the number of particles inside the droplet decays with increasing temperature . </S>"
