    "six of our groups , hcg  7 , 16 , 25 , 35 , 55 , and 88 , fall within the sky and redshift coverage of these surveys and all of them have been identified as galaxy groups by @xcite the sdss and 2df surveys are deeper than that used by @xcite and hence the @xcite catalog includes additional fainter galaxies associated with these groups .",
    "they derived halo masses for these groups , which range between ( 2 - 115 )  @xmath0  10@xmath23  m@xmath24 .",
    "the independent identification of all 6 hcgs within the sdss and 2df sky coverage lends further support that our sample refinement described above successfully identified real physical groups .",
    "we conducted gbt observations of the 21  cm  and 18  cm oh transitions for 26 hcgs in may and october 2005 as part of the gbt05a-051 and gbt05c-005 programs .",
    "the data on hcg  67 and hcg  79 were severely corrupted by solar interference , and new observations were obtained in august 2006 as part of the gbt06b-053 program .",
    "we used the dual polarization l - band system that covers the frequency range between 1.15 and 1.73 gigahertz ( ghz ) . using 9-level sampling and two",
    "if settings , each with 12.5 mhz total bandwidth , the spectrometer gives 8192 channels at 1.5  khz ( 0.3  km s@xmath14 ) resolution , covering a total velocity range of 2500  km s@xmath14 .",
    "we employed the standard position - switching scheme by cycling through the on - off sequence , dwelling for 300 seconds at each position . a position offset of + 20  in right ascension",
    "was adopted for the off position so that the presence of any confusing sources in the off position could be tracked .",
    "we also performed local pointing corrections ( lpc ) using the observing procedure autopeak , which was then automatically applied to the data .",
    "hence , the error in pointing should be less than gbt s global pointing accuracy of 2.7  @xmath25 , which is less that 0.5% of gbt beam size at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the clean optics and active surface system of the gbt also results in a well - calibrated structure and a stable gain at the 21 cm wavelength .",
    "the primary flux calibrators 3c  48 ( 16.5 jy ) , 3c  147 ( 22.5 jy ) , and 3c  286 ( 15.0 jy ) were observed regularly to monitor the instrumental performance , and the antenna gain of 1.65@xmath260.05 k / jy is derived from these data .",
    "our regular observation of bright calibration sources has verified the stability of the telescope gain factor .",
    "the rms noise after 60 minutes of on - source integration was 1.4 mk when the spectra were smoothed to 50 khz ( @xmath1310 km s@xmath14 ) resolution .",
    "the corresponding 5@xmath27  mass detection limit at a distance of 100 mpc is 1.65@xmath28  m@xmath24 where @xmath29 is the line - width of the  emission .",
    "the gbt data also has very good stability within the bandwidth and the baselines could be fitted using first or second order polynomial for most of the hcgs .",
    "all the line - free channels with the exception of 200 channels at each end were used to fit baselines .",
    "since most of the groups were observed near transit , we estimate an attenuation due to opacity of the air to be around 1% and corrected the gbt spectra accordingly .",
    "the second if was tuned to search for the 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz oh maser transitions simultaneously with the  transition .",
    "dense molecular gas associated with nuclear starbursts or circum - nuclear disks has been detected in oh maser emission in nearby and distant galaxies ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "excited primarily through ir pumping , these transitions trace the presence of a substantial quantity of warm and dense molecular material ( t = 40 - 200 k , @xmath30 @xmath31 ) heated by an intense radiation field .",
    "no oh maser was detected in any of the groups .",
    "this result is consistent with the absence of infrared bright starburst systems in these groups @xcite .",
    "thus , we concentrate on the analysis of the  emission in the remainder of the paper .",
    "among the 26 hcgs observed using the gbt ,  emission was detected in all but one group .",
    "the  masses for the groups are calculated using the relationship m(hi ) = 2.36@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the luminosity distance to the group in megaparsec ( mpc ) and the @xmath34 is the velocity integrated  flux density in jy  km  s@xmath14  .",
    "the derived  masses within the gbt beam ( @xmath139.1@xmath35 ) range between @xmath36  m@xmath24 ( see table  [ tbl - gbt ] for individual values including  mass and linewidth ) . the velocity range over which the  line flux is integrated is also presented in table  [ tbl - gbt ] .",
    "the only undetected group , hcg  35 , is the highest redshift group and is not a member of our distance - limited complete sample .",
    "the sensitivity of the gbt makes the @xmath37 upper limit for this high redshift group ( @xmath38  km  s@xmath14 ) @xmath39 assuming a line width of @xmath40  km  s@xmath14(average line - width for our sample ) .",
    "we adopt a systematic uncertainty in calibration and baseline subtraction of 10% , which is substantially larger than the measured noise level ( around 1% ) in most cases . for hcg  40 , which was observed under the pilot program gbt05a-051 , the antenna gain was not measured .",
    "we adopt the same gain factor from our observation under the program gbt05c-005 .",
    "the reduced and calibrated spectra are shown in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "visual comparison of our gbt spectra with previous single dish measurements by @xcite and @xcite confirm our calibration accuracy .",
    "a detailed comparison is not discussed here .",
    "the large aperture , clean optics , and the low noise receiver of the gbt lead to superior calibration , sensitivity , and baseline stability compared with the earlier single dish measurements .",
    "this makes the gbt an excellent instrument for detecting the diffuse neutral component of the igm , which may be very faint , extended , or broad in velocity ( @xmath41 km  s@xmath14 ) . also , the noise level achieved in our observations after an hour of integration is about 5 times lower than that of @xcite .",
    "the extended nature of the  emission in these groups also makes a meaningful comparison with other single dish measurements with different beam sizes difficult .",
    "instead , we focus our comparative analysis on the  data obtained using the gbt and the vla .",
    "hi deficiency is a measure of the deviation of the observed  mass from the predicted  mass for a galaxy based on its optical luminosity and morphology ( see * ? ?",
    "* table 5 , page 791 ) .",
    "it is defined as @xmath42 log[m(hi)@xmath43 @xmath16 log[m(hi)@xmath44 .",
    "the predicted  mass for a galaxy group is estimated as the sum of the predicted  masses for individual galaxies ( vm2001 ) .",
    "the values of predicted  masses used in our analysis are taken from vm2001 , which used optical luminosities and morphologies from @xcite .",
    "hcg  90 was not included in the vm2001 sample and thus we estimate the predicted  mass for this group following the same procedure as vm2001 . in most cases the gbt beam covered all the galaxies in a group , with the exception of hcg 10 , 44 , 68 , & 93 where we correct the predicted  mass to account for the gbt beam coverage .",
    "we assume that the predicted  mass in individual galaxies is distributed uniformly inside the optical extent of the galaxy and hence the correction in the predicted mass translates to the fraction of the optical galaxy covered by the gbt beam .",
    "the observed  masses , the predicted  masses within the gbt beam and their corresponding  deficiencies are provided in table  [ tbl - gbt ] .",
    "a comparison of the predicted  mass and the observed  mass for our entire sample is shown in figure  [ mass_obs_pred ] .",
    "we find that most of the groups are  deficient . while the predicted  masses for most of the groups are similar , ranging from 9.34 to 10.57 dex ; the observed  masses vary over two orders of magnitudes due to the range in  deficiency .",
    "the highest redshift group hcg  35 ( part of our additional sources ) can be seen with an arrow indicating the observed mass as a 3  @xmath45 upper limit .",
    "was detected in the other three groups part of our additional sources and all of them lie in the  normal region of the plot .",
    "the  content and spatial distribution in the groups is dependent on the evolutionary history of individual galaxies .",
    "any transformation of neutral hydrogen as a result of tidal interaction within the group environment is expected to have some correlation with the group s  deficiency .",
    "therefore , we have divided the hcgs from our complete sample into three classes based on their predicted  mass and the gbt observed  mass :    * normal  content : observed mass more than 2/3 of the predicted value ( hcg 23 , 25 , 79 , & 68 ) ; * slightly  deficient : observed mass ranges between 2/3 to 1/3 of the predicted value ( hcg 10 , 15 , 16 , 31 , 37 , 40 , 58 , 88 , 91 , 92 , 97 , & 100 ) ; and * highly  deficient : observed mass less than 1/3 of the predicted value ( hcg  7 , 30 , 44 , 67 , 90 , & 93 ) .",
    "these distinctions are based on the observed scatter in the  content for each hubble type ( @xmath130.2 in dex ; see * ? ? ?",
    "this classification enables us to examine quantitatively the hypothesis that the  content of each group indicates their age or evolutionary stage .",
    "the  deficiencies estimated by vm2001 using previous single dish measurements are also presented in table  [ tbl - gbt ] for comparison . for 80% of the groups , the gbt detected more  than previous single dish observations using nrao s 91 m telescope even though the beam size for these observations was 10.8@xmath35 (",
    "* vm2001 ) . for three slightly deficient groups and two highly deficient groups the previous single dish values are larger than that measured using the gbt .",
    "the most likely source of this difference is the extended nature of the  distribution which was captured better by the 10.8@xmath35 beam as opposed to the 9.1@xmath35 gbt beam .",
    "the histogram of  deficiency evaluated from gbt data is shown in figure  [ plot_his ] .",
    "the peak of the distribution lies in the deficiency range of 0.2 to 0.4 .",
    "the dotted curve represents the expected distribution of  deficiency for a  normal sample .",
    "this shows that the uncertainty in deficiency estimation can not account for the observed distribution and therefore , confirms the existence of  deficiency in hcgs .    even though these highly sensitive measurements decrease the  deficiency of hcgs considerably , however , it does not elevate the total  content of these groups to the normal level .",
    "the addition of hot igm traced in x - ray may in some cases .",
    "@xcite analyzed new and archival x - ray data from chandra and xmm - newton telescopes for eight hcgs , and their x - ray results add a few times @xmath46 to 10@xmath47 of hot igm gas to the total gas content in some of the x - ray bright groups .",
    "this result suggests a direction for solving the  deficiency problem by accounting for colder tidally stripped material that might have been ionized in the igm .",
    "however , it is crucial to account for all sources of hot gas in galaxy groups like accretion of gas from large - scale structures by the group potential , feedback from constitute galaxies as well as the deposition of cold ism in the igm as a result of tidal activities .",
    "it is also clear that the tidal debris is not the major contributor to the hot igm gas mass as the missing  mass ( m ( ) @xmath48 - m ( ) @xmath49 ) for x - ray bright groups like hcg  15 , 37 , 40 , & 97 is on an average an order of magnitude smaller that the hot gas mass @xcite .",
    "it is a common practice to compare the flux recovered by an interferometer with a single dish measurement in order to characterize the limitations of the resulting aperture synthesis images .",
    "for instance , an interferometer such as the vla is a spatial filter and is thus insensitive to diffuse , extended structures @xmath50 in the d - array .",
    "however , since most of the observations are shorter than 12 hours and used natural weight the maximum angular scale should be smaller than 15@xmath35 ] .",
    "although the collecting area of the gbt and the vla are comparable , the vla has a much lower surface brightness sensitivity than the gbt .",
    "in addition , the gbt has a larger instantaneous bandwidth ( @xmath52  km  s@xmath14 ) that allows identification of emission features with a much broader ( @xmath53  km  s@xmath14 ) line - width . in comparison ,",
    "the bandwidth of the vla is less than half of the gbt , and broad spectral features can be easily missed by the vla due to limited spectral coverage .",
    "the vla data used for comparison come primarily from our own imaging survey of hcgs @xcite .",
    "additional comparison data for six groups are constructed by our own reduction of the archival data that were published previously @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl - vla ] summarizes the details of the vla data used for comparison .",
    "the flux density sensitivity of the comparison vla data is similar in most cases ( @xmath13 0.5  mjy / beam ) , but the angular and spectral resolutions vary slightly .",
    "comparisons of the new gbt spectra with the spectra derived from the vla observations for our complete sample as well as for two of the additional sources are shown in figure  [ comparisons ] .",
    "we define the difference between the vla and the gbt spectra as the excess  mass @xmath54 we make a quantitative characterization of the excess gas as a fraction of the total  in a group and define it as the excess gas mass fraction , @xmath55 @xmath56 in groups where the excess  mass dominates , the value of this ratio is greater than 50% .",
    "similarly , in groups where this ratio is smaller than 50% , the primarily  component is the high surface brightness  detected by the vla .",
    "figure  [ mass_his ] is a histogram of the total  mass and the excess  mass in our sample .",
    "the excess gas mass fraction,@xmath55 for our complete sample varies between 5% and 81% with an average value of @xmath57 ( table  [ tbl - filling_factor ] ) . in order to ensure that this comparison is fair",
    ", we multiply the original vla map with the gbt beam pattern and then summing the  flux in each channel to construct the corresponding vla spectra . therefore , the vla spectra used in the comparison are for regions identical to those observed by the gbt . furthermore",
    ", the quantitative comparison of the  mass is limited to the velocity range that is common to both spectra although the gbt detected much broader emission features in some cases .",
    "consequently , the values mentioned above are lower limits of the  missed by the vla .",
    "the gbt data is also much more sensitive than the vla data and this easily noticeable in hcgs with faint  emission such as hcg  15 , 37 , 90 , and 97 .",
    "extra steps were taken to ensure consistency in the calibration as reliable cross - calibration is critical for quantitative comparisons . to ensure excellent calibration with respect to the vla , we observed the same three vla primary flux calibrators 3c  48 , 3c  147 , and 3c  286 throughout the observing run . by taking these extra calibration steps",
    ", we estimate that the calibration between the gbt and the vla spectra should agree within 10% .",
    "the excellent agreement between the gbt and the vla spectra for groups dominated by high surface brightness ( hsb ) features , such as hcg  7 , 10 , 16 , and 67 , nicely demonstrates the success of our cross - calibration . even in groups where there is an overall difference in total flux such as hcg  26 and 79 , parts of the spectra match well within the statistical errors",
    "the fact that the total flux measured by the gbt _ always _ agrees or exceeds the vla measurement ( except in the case of hcg  40 where we have a large calibration uncertainty ) but is never smaller rules out the possibility of relative calibration accuracy varying wildly .",
    "therefore , calibration errors are not responsible for the dramatic differences seen in hcg  31 ,  44 , and 100 , and the excess emission in the gbt spectra is real . the excess emission is also correlated with the group properties ( see   [ sec : trends ] ) , and this is a strong indication that the measured excesses are real .",
    "one may plausibly suspect a continuum subtraction error for missing broad spectral features in the vla data .",
    "however , the absence of negative flux values in the vla images , which is expected from overdoing continuum subtraction , rules out significant errors in vla data reduction .",
    "three broad categories on the spectral distribution of the excess gas have emerged from our comparison of the gbt and the vla spectra : ( i ) identical line widths but with a large line flux difference ; ( ii ) broad emission wings ( 50 - 200 km  s@xmath14 ) associated with vla detected spectral features ; and ( iii ) broad ( @xmath58 km  s@xmath14 ) emission features outside the vla  line - width . the most commonly seen is the category i , and nearly all groups show this trait to a degree .",
    "the identical line widths is a strong indication that the additional emission detected by the gbt is associated with the structure traced by the vla .",
    "it is possible that additional , independent  systems sharing the same velocity range are present , and a few distinct features with a narrow line - width were seen in the gbt spectra .",
    "the second category with broad emission wings is also relatively common .",
    "hcg  92 ( `` stefan s quintet '' ) and hcg  100 represent two outstanding examples of this type , characterized by broad  emission wings in excess over the velocity range detected by the vla .",
    "the wing features in hcg  92 cover the velocity range 6300 to 6530 km  s@xmath14and 5750 to 5900  km  s@xmath14where as in hcg  100 the wing feature can be seen in the velocity range from 5450 to 5650 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the excess can be seen in the gbt data even when it is binned to match the resolution of the vla spectra ( see figure  [ h92_binned ] ) .",
    "a collision involving an intruder at a velocity in excess of 1000 km  s@xmath14  is currently occurring in hcg  92 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and the broad  wings are plausibly associated with high velocity shocks in this case .",
    "the vla imaging of hcg  100 shows a cloud of  surrounding most of the member galaxies and extending far beyond the group diameter in the vla image @xcite .",
    "the vla spectrum is clearly missing the broad wings on both sides of the main  peak .",
    "other groups showing similar broad emission wings are hcg   31 , 44 , and 79 .",
    "the third category is the broad , faint emission features unseen in the vla spectra . in hcg  15 ,",
    "we detected 56% of total  in this system as excess   emission spread over a velocity range of more than 1000  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the vla channel maps of hcg  15 show  emission associated with a single galaxy @xcite spread over no more than 250  km  s@xmath14  .",
    "the vla not only missed the broad  emission because of a smaller bandwidth , but also could not detect fainter emission due to the limitation in its surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "the vla observations of hcg  30 and 37 have failed to detect _ any _ high surface brightness  emission @xcite while their gbt spectra show faint , broad emission covering the entire redshift range of the member galaxies ( see figure  [ comparisons ] ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the _ entire _",
    "emission in these groups is in a diffuse component .",
    "in addition , hcg  44 , 58 , 79 , 90 , and 97 also show evidence of faint , broad emission not detected by the vla .",
    "hcg 31 is one of the most interesting cases where the comparison of  spectra shows an enormous difference between the gbt and the vla , confirming the presence of a substantial diffuse neutral igm with much larger  mass than was previously believed . the peak flux and the line profile of the gbt spectrum matches very well with spectra published by @xcite , thus confirming our calibration .",
    "another interesting fact that stands out in the comparison plot for hcg  31 in figure  [ comparisons ] is that discrete features seen in the vla spectrum are not seen in the gbt spectrum .",
    "in fact , the gbt spectrum is much smoother , and the velocity range between the discrete peaks at 4000  km s@xmath14 and 4120  km s@xmath14 is filled in .",
    "it is likely that the diffuse  emission spread over a velocity range @xmath59 km  s@xmath14  accounts for the majority of the gbt spectrum .",
    "the diffuse  is likely associated with features much larger in angular extent than group size , possibly in  filaments being accreted by the group , similar to those seen in the vla image reported previously by @xcite .",
    "additional observations are underway for an in - depth investigation of the nature of the excess  detected by gbt .",
    "content in hcgs varies enormously from one group to another .",
    "vm2001 found a broad range of   deficiency with a mean  content of 24% of the expected amount ( @xmath60 ) for the individual galaxies and about 40% ( @xmath61 ) for the groups .",
    "the  distribution in these groups is also quite diverse , ranging from groups dominated by normal galaxies with distinct individual  disks to groups with galaxies submerged in a single common  cloud .",
    "evidence for strong tidal interactions is frequently seen in the  distribution imaged by the vla .",
    "such interactions continuously shape the gas distribution and morphology .",
    "consequently , the  content and morphology reflects the evolutionary history of a group @xcite .",
    "a new result from our new gbt survey is that the excess  emission is quite common among hcgs .",
    "here we attempt to understand the distribution and nature of the excess gas through a quantitative analysis of the vla and the gbt spectra and group properties .",
    "the amount of  detected by the gbt exceeds the vla detected amount by a factor of two or more in hcg  15 , 31 , 37 , 44 , 68 , 92 , 97 , and 100 , suggesting that the _ majority _ of  in these groups is associated with extended diffuse structure , undetected by the vla .",
    "we experimented with the vla data to look for signs of a spatially extended  component using multi - scale clean in the imagr procedure of the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) which enhances flux associated with larger angular scales ( or shorter baselines ) @xcite .",
    "figure  [ h100_msclean ] shows an overlay of the multi - scale cleaned vla spectra of hcg  100 over its gbt and the vla spectra.the vla multi - scale clean spectrum was obtained by using three gaussian source model widths- 0 , 200 and 300 arcsecs , in deconvolving the images . even in this case ,",
    "not all of the gbt flux is recovered , and nearly all `` recovered '' features are faint extensions of features already seen in the standard reduction map ( details in * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the missing gas in the vla images may exist as either : ( 1 ) low column density diffuse medium which can only be detected by gbt due to its superb surface brightness sensitivity ; ( 2 ) spatially extended sheets , filaments or extended disks that are missed by the vla because of spatial filtering ; or ( 3 ) as a combination of both .",
    "a physical parameter that provides a quantitative way of distinguishing between these paradigms is the filling factor of the excess gas .",
    "we characterize the filling factor as the fraction of the gbt beam the excess gas would cover if it was distributed uniformly with column density corresponding to the noise level ( 3  @xmath62 ) in vla maps .",
    "thus , the filling factor a@xmath63 is computed as    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the area of the gbt beam in @xmath66 and m@xmath67 is the mass of an hydrogen atom .",
    "table  [ tbl - filling_factor ] summarizes the excess  masses , vla noise properties and the filling factors for each of the groups .",
    "the 3@xmath27 column density ( seventh column of table  [ tbl - filling_factor ] ) was derived assuming that the features are spread over 2 channels thus implying an intrinsic line - width of 42  km  s@xmath14  .",
    "the derived filling factor covers a wide range of values , from as little as 3% in hcg  79 to 566% in hcg  68 . for most of the hcgs",
    ", @xmath68 is much smaller than 100% , which supports the presence of a faint diffuse  medium that could have been missed by the vla due to its lower surface brightness sensitivity . for groups with @xmath68 @xmath69%",
    ", spatial filtering by the vla leading to a significant loss of flux is a highly plausible explanation .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that in all four cases where the filling factor is greater than 100% , ( hcg  44 , 68 , 91 , & 100 ) , vla maps show cloud - like structures or extended disks covering around 8 - 10 @xmath35 ( nearly the entire gbt beam ) .",
    "furthermore , striking similarities in the spectral profile between the vla and the gbt spectra in these five systems strongly advocate that the excess gas is dynamically similar to the  structures mapped by the vla .",
    "the excess gas is often associated with a broad ; smooth spectral feature rather than discrete peaks . the dominant spectral feature in spectra of  deficient groups like hcg  15 , 90 , and",
    "97 is a faint broad feature .",
    "the gbt also detected broad wing - like features in many other groups including hcg  92 , 79 , and 58 .",
    "a noteworthy characteristic is that these broad emission tends to fill the gaps between peaks in the spectrum , resulting in a much smoother spectrum such as in hcg  31 ( also see hcg  26 , 67 , & 100 ) .",
    "this suggests the presence of a diffuse fainter  component distributed over a large velocity range .",
    "the probable origin of this  component is the evolution of tidally stripped ism in the hot igm ( see   [ sec : lifetime_origin ] ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the fate of tidally stripped ism clouds in the hot igm is presented in the next section .    in summary , we conclude that the excess gas is spread over a large velocity range and is smoothly distributed as a diffuse , low surface brightness medium .",
    "the broad spectral signatures specifically rule out cold discrete filaments .",
    "the filling factor values suggest that the excess gas is extended and must occupy at - least a significant fraction ( median = 40% ) of the gbt beam .",
    "consequently , the excess gas exists as a faint diffuse neutral intragroup medium in most hcgs . in a few groups where @xmath70 , large hsb  structures that were spatially resolved out by the vla may also contributes to the excess .",
    "a combination of the diffuse igm and some hsb features is likely in groups exhibiting large line - flux differences along with broad wing - like spectral features ( e.g. , hcg  100 ) .",
    "these groups may also represent a transitional phase occurring between groups with clumps of tidally stripped  in their igm and groups with a faint diffuse extended  component distributed in their igm .",
    "compact groups are evolving structures . the dynamical time ( @xmath71 ) for a typical group with a diameter of 100  kpc and velocity dispersion of 250  km",
    "s@xmath14  is around 400  myr . during this time ,",
    "galaxies experience multiple tidal interactions with each other , and a considerable amount of ism may be removed from individual galaxies and deposited in the group environment .",
    "this is evident in groups like hcg  16 which show multiple tidal tails ( vm2001 ) and also in groups like hcg  92 where the  has been tidally removed from their parent galaxies and deposited as large  clouds in the igm @xcite .",
    "the nature and fate of neutral gas in such extreme environments are determined by the interplay of heating and cooling in these systems .",
    "the fate of tidally stripped debris can provide clues about possible causes of  deficiency commonly observed among galaxies in such dense environments .    in this section ,",
    "we attempt to check theoretically if the neutral tidal debris should survive for a considerable amount of time for us to be able to detect it in systems like the hcgs .",
    "in other words , should we expect to find a surviving component of the tidal debris deposited in the igm ? in order to do so , we investigate the timescales and conditions for the survival of neutral clouds in the hot igm .",
    "for a spiral dominated galaxy group , @xcite calculated the expected virial temperature of the igm to be around 2  @xmath0  10@xmath6  k. any cold  cloud / filament will be conductively heated by the hot igm .",
    "this can ionize the cloud and incorporate it into the hot igm .",
    "in addition , a neutral cloud will expand into the igm due to its intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "this will eventually lower its column density and make it more susceptible to ionization by the ultra - violet radiation background .",
    "based on the timescales of these processes , we can derive the expected lifetime of a typical tidally stripped cloud .",
    "since we have ample evidence of diffuse neutral igm in hcgs , we can explore the parameter space for physical conditions that will ensure the survival of the  clouds over the dynamical time - scale of the groups .",
    "this will help in constraining the properties of the  clouds as well as the igm , which in most galaxy groups escape detection by being too cold to emit in the x - ray .",
    "we begin by investigating the effects of conductive heating on a cold neutral cloud embedded in hot igm .",
    "this process is not instantaneous , and the evaporation timescale depends on the physical properties of both the  cloud as well as the igm .",

    "the evaporation timescale is strongly correlated with the size of the cloud .",
    "the lower limit of  cloud size that can survive the igm for more than @xmath71 is @xmath13200  pc .",

    "our gbt detections , combined with information from vla images , confirm that  in hcgs survives long enough to be seen frequently in their harsh environments .",
    "using this crucial piece of information , we can constraint the physical conditions of the  clouds as well as the hot igm by finding the region in the parameter space where the evaporation timescale is greater than the dynamical timescale of the groups . throughout our analysis we will assumed the  clouds to be stationary .",
    "if the proper motion of the  clouds could be estimated more stronger constraints could be achieved .",
    "unfortunately with the present state of observational data such estimation is not possible .",

    "figure  [ lifetimes ] shows the parameter for eight different combinations of igm temperature and cloud density .",
    "the plots have been arranged with increasing temperature from top to the bottom and increasing density from left to right .",
    "these plots clearly show that evaporation timescales decrease with increase in the igm temperature and with the decrease in the density of the cloud , as expected from eqs  [ eq - tc ] and [ eq - ts ] .",
    "given that we detected 21  cm emitting cold gas in most of the groups , we can conclude that the igm temperature is less than 4  @xmath0  10@xmath6  k unless the density of the hot igm is unusually low .",
    "also , the density of the  clouds , responsible for excess emission in the gbt spectra , is most likely higher than 0.01  @xmath31 unless the igm is substantially cooler than 2  @xmath0  10@xmath6  k. this follows from the fact that the clouds with density lower than 0.01  @xmath31 would not survive long enough to be detected in an igm corresponding to typical virial temperature of 2  @xmath0  10@xmath6  k. since the relevant parameter space is mostly in the classical regime , the variation of igm temperature has a much stronger effect on the timescale than the density of the cloud . on the other hand , the density of the igm effects the timescale only in the saturated evaporation regime and consequently , we can not draw a strong constraint on the n@xmath73 from our data .",
    "in addition to heating , the tidal  debris should also experience expansion as a result of their intrinsic velocity dispersion unless they are bound by their self - gravity .",
    "such an expansion of an  cloud would lower its column density , making it prone to ionization by the intergalactic uv radiation field . the 21  cm  studies by @xcite , and others have shown that a minimum column density of @xmath99  cm@xmath10 is required for an  cloud to shield itself from the background uv radiation field .",
    "therefore , the expansion timescale , which refers to the time an  cloud would take to reach the above mentioned column density , is important in estimating the lifetime of an expanding tidal structure . as a cloud expands its column density decreases which can be expressed in terms of the initial column density ( @xmath101 ) and initial radius @xmath102 as @xmath103    assuming that the tidally stripped cloud in question is a disk / cylinder with @xmath102  = 1  kpc and @xmath104  cm@xmath10 , expanding at @xmath105  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the expansion timescale for this cloud to reach the above mentioned threshold value is around 500  myrs . in this time",
    "the cloud expands more than 100 times its initial area ( or 1000 times its initial volume ) , thereby creating a faint diffuse neutral igm .",
    "based on the observed deficiencies as well as complex  tidal structures seen in vla imaging of the hcgs , the excess gas mass can be attributed to evolving tidal debris deposited by the individual galaxies .",
    "the fact that the excess gas does not render the hcgs superabundant in  supports the tidal debris origin of the excess gas .",
    "furthermore , the velocity distribution of the excess gas is extremely similar in line shape to that of the vla detected high surface brightness  associated with individual galaxies ( catagory i ) in more than 80% of the groups .",
    "the excess gas content also increases with the evolutionary phase ( vm2001 ) of the group ( discussed in detail in ",
    "[ sec : dep_evol ] ) , which supports the idea of evolution of tidal debris into this component .",
    "similar detections of tidal  structures by @xcite and @xcite in an even more extreme environment of the virgo intercluster medium also lends support the existence and preservation of tidally stripped neutral gas for @xmath106 years .    a potentially important process for the igm in some of the x - ray bright compact groups such as hcg  97 and hcg  15 is the precipitation of cold gas from the hot igm through the radiative cooling ( so - called  cooling flow  * ? ? ?",
    "unless a constant source of energy is present to reheat the gas back to the igm temperature , hot gas is expected to cool down in the centers of groups and clusters .",
    "calculations based on work by @xcite suggest that the transfer of heat from hot igm to the condensing cores would take about 0.5  gyr for a group of size 100  kpc .",
    "such a conduction time - scale for the igm suggests the possibility of a neutral igm resulting from cooling of the x - ray bright igm at the centers of these groups .",
    "however , most of the hcgs used in our study are not x - ray bright and therefore , cooling flow is not likely to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the existence of the neutral gas in our sample .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that the majority of the excess gas detected by the gbt is not a result of condensation of the hot igm .    in a handful of groups where the gbt beam covered a region much larger than the group size , accretion of cold gas from the large - scale structure @xcite",
    "is a possibility . for most of the hcgs",
    "we have surveyed the central region of the groups where the accreted cold gas , if any , is expect to get shock heated and ionized thus eliminating the possibility of its survival for ubiquitous detection in 21  cm emission .",
    "therefore , the most plausible origin of the excess gas found in the central regions of the hcgs is  tidal debris deposited in the igm as individual galaxies interacted with each other and the group potential . in this scenario ,",
    "no additional cold gas contribution from accretion or cooling flows ( for x - ray bright hcgs ) is required , although minor contributions from these processes can not be ruled out .",
    "m@xmath107 is substantial in most of our groups and has important implications on our understanding of the group medium and its evolution .",

    "the angular diameter of the groups varied between 1.3@xmath35 to 16.4@xmath35 , which translates to 0.14 to 1.80 times the gbt beam at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the excess gas mass fraction is shown as a function of the group diameter sampled by the gbt beam in figure  [ diff_beam_ratio ] . for groups where @xmath109",

    "for instance in hcg  44 , where the excess gas mass fraction is 60% , the gbt beam covers only the inner one - third of the group area ( group diameter is 16.4@xmath35 ) .",
    "in other words , the diffuse excess gas is the major contributor to the total  mass in the central region of this system .",
    "this indicates that the distribution of the diffuse component is within the central region of the groups along with the individual galaxies .",
    "the majority of groups are either lack any diffuse component or are dominated by it with few groups lying in between as seen in figure  [ diff_beam_ratio ] .",
    "in fact , this offers the first indication that the @xmath55 distribution is clustered , with one peak near @xmath110 and a second peak near @xmath111 , irrespective of the fraction of group diameter covered by the gbt .",
    "there are only two systems with 0.3  @xmath112  0.5 .",
    "this suggests that the transition from the low diffuse gas phase to high diffuse gas is not gradual . instead",
    ", the transition may be quite rapid and the change in the ratio indicates an evolution in the group property .    in terms of the physical dimension ,",

    "figure  [ diff_size ] shows the same data as figure  [ diff_beam_ratio ] but in physical units ( kilo parsec ) .",
    "the trends seen are essentially identical to those presented in figure  [ diff_beam_ratio ] , but a potentially important and new insight is offered : _ groups where the surveyed region is smaller than 100  kpc show a rather significant fraction of excess gas , @xmath113_. while the statistics are poor , such a trend is expected only in scenarios where the group radius actually reflects the physical proximity of the member galaxies .",
    "specifically , such a trend should not exist in apparent groups identified by chance projection only ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "our hcg sample can be divided into three categories on the basis of their  deficiencies , as normal  content , slightly  deficient , and highly  deficient ( see   [ sec : hidef ] ) .",
    "the original definition of  deficiency was based on the  content of individual galaxies . however , in hcgs the   distribution varies enormously from the distribution of the optical galaxies , and it is often not possible to associate  structures with individual galaxies .",
    "therefore , we extend the definition of  deficiency to groups by evaluating the ratio of the sum of the predicted  mass for individual members to the observed  mass associated with the entire group .    the excess  fraction for the three deficiency classes of hcgs is summarized in table  [ hi_def ] .",
    "the mean ( median ) excess gas mass fraction , @xmath55 , for the normal  content , slightly  deficient , and highly  deficient groups are 30  % ( 26% ) , 42  % ( 51% ) , and 28  % ( 20% ) respectively . the comparison of  deficiency for the groups is also shown graphically on the top panel of figure  [ 3histograms ] . most of the groups with a high fraction of excess gas are slightly  deficient groups whereas most of the normal and highly deficient groups have much smaller fraction of excess gas .",
    "the scatter within each class is large which makes the average distribution ineffective in deducing any statistically significant conclusion .    on the other hand , for groups with  deficiency  @xmath18  0.4 ( @xmath114  2  @xmath27 in predicted  mass )",
    ", one would expect the two tidally stripped  components - diffuse  detected only by the gbt and the high surface brightness ( hsb )  detected by the vla , to constitute the total  in these systems .",
    "figure  [ hsb_diff ] shows a comparison of the excess gas content and the hsb  content in terms of the predicted mass for a sub sample of 11 hcgs , where  deficiency  @xmath18  0.4 . in general , the fraction of diffuse excess gas increases with the increase in the  deficiency .",
    "the spearman s ( rho ) rank correlation coefficient for this subsample is @xmath160.523919 with significance of its deviation from zero of 0.098 .",
    "this provides an indication that hsb structures in the igm are evolving into the diffuse  component before being ionized and assimilated into the hot igm .    in terms of the evolution and fate of the neutral tidal debris",
    ", the diffuse gas can be understood as an intermediate stage between hsb  and ionized hydrogen . in this picture , the stripped  from the galaxies begin their life as tidal features ( vm2001 ) in the igm , which evolves into a diffuse faint cold gas component that was detected with the gbt . after a certain threshold , depending on the physical parameters of the igm and the diffuse  clouds ( see   [",
    "sec : lifetime ] ) , the hot igm ionizes and assimilates the diffuse component .",
    "thus , in the early stages of evolution , groups show an increasing fraction of diffuse gas component with increasing deviation from  normalcy . towards the later stages of evolution , groups continue to show strong  deficiency as the diffuse  component is transformed into the ionized igm and cold neutral gas is truly lost from these systems . since the tidal interactions do not continuously deposit constant amount of neutral debris in the igm , no correlation between the total hsb component and the total diffuse gas component is expected or observed for highly evolved systems .",
    "hcgs represent the full range of formative and evolutionary stages of galaxy groups .",
    "vm2001 proposed an evolutionary sequence in hcgs based on their  morphology and distribution . according to this model , during the first phase of evolution ( phase 1 ) , the  distribution and kinematics are relatively unperturbed , and more than 90% of the  mass",
    "is found in the disks of individual galaxies with the remaining gas found in incipient tidal tails . in the second stage of evolution (",
    "phase 2 ) , groups still retain a significant amount of  in the disks , but 30% to 60% of the total  mass forms tidal features . in the final phase ,",
    "most of the  is stripped from the disks and is found in tails produced by tidal interactions or not detected at all ( phase 3a ) .",
    "a slightly less common phase is the phase 3b where the  forms a single large cloud containing all galaxies with a continuous velocity gradient and a single peak line profile .",
    "a statistical comparison of the excess gas mass fraction , @xmath55 , for our sample based on their evolutionary stage is shown in table [ evolution ] .",
    "for this analysis we do not distinguish between phases 3a and 3b .",
    "the mean ( median ) excess gas mass fraction for groups in the evolutionary phases 1 , 2 , and 3 are 21  % ( 21  % ) , 30  % ( 17  % ) , and 48  % ( 54  % ) , respectively .",
    "dispersion in excess  fractionamong the members in a phase may be understood in terms of a continuous evolutionary sequence in hcgs where the three phases are broadly ( and somewhat arbitrarily ) divided to quantify the gradual change .",
    "it is apparent that in the initial phases of evolution there is much less diffuse neutral igm than in the last phase , where the neutral igm is well developed .",
    "for instance , all the groups in the phase  3 , with the exception of hcg  93 , have a considerably large fraction of diffuse  .",
    "hcg  93 may be a special case where the addition of a new  rich member ( 93b ) reduces the fractional significance of the diffuse neutral  in the igm .",
    "a graphical comparison of excess gas mass fraction shown in the middle panel of figure  [ 3histograms ] demonstrates the clustering of phases 1 and 2 towards lower values and phase 3 hcgs towards higher values of the excess gas mass fraction . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : groupdiameter ] , this clustering may indicate a rapid transition for groups dominated by  mostly in the ism of individual galaxies to a phase where most of the  is found in the igm .",
    "we emphasize that the group evolutionary phase is determined from the  _ morphology _ as mapped by the vla while the excess gas mass fraction comes from the _ integral total line flux _ in the gbt spectra .",

    "evolutionary scenario , this trend indicates that the evolutionary phases 1 & 2 are much closer in timescale and in terms of the neutral igm build - up process , and the evolutionary phase 3 is indeed more distinct .",
    "again , the small sample size and a large dispersion within each sub - sample is an important limitation .      in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "paradigm , dark matter halo properties such as mass and angular momentum determine the galaxy properties .",
    "specifically , for a given massive halo , the nature of the central galaxy is thought to be determined by the merger history of the halo . by examining the dependence of the cross - correlation between galaxies and galaxy groups on group properties",
    ", @xcite found that the dark matter halo bias of galaxy groups decreases as the star formation rate of the central galaxy increases .",
    "these authors interpret this finding in terms of the halo bias dependence on halo formation time @xcite , in the sense that halos that were assembled earlier are more strongly biased with a redder central galaxy .",
    "in other words , on an average galaxy groups with a red central dominant galaxy have formed much earlier than groups with a blue central dominant galaxy even if their present halo masses are the same .",
    "an excess of early type galaxies in hcgs have been reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and vm2001 suggested that some of the lenticulars and s0 galaxies were spirals that were stripped of their  disks as a result of galaxy interactions .",
    "we have examined whether the excess  content has any dependence on the hubble type of the group central dominant galaxy . if the earlier hubble type of the central dominant galaxy is an indicator of an earlier formation time or equivalently an advanced stage of evolution for the group , greater excess  content is expected , provided the diffuse intragroup gas can survive long enough compared to the mass assembly time .",
    "we find the mean and median for the excess gas mass fraction is 32  % and 23  % for the spiral dominated hcgs and the mean and the median for non - spiral dominated hcgs are 42  % and 49  % , respectively ( see table  [ hubbletype ] ) .",
    "the graphical comparison shown on the bottom panel in figure  [ 3histograms ] shows the distribution of the spiral and non - spiral dominated groups .",
    "most of the spiral dominated groups have lower excess gas mass fractions where as the non - spiral dominated groups cover the entire range .",
    "however , there is a some overlap between the two sub - samples .",
    "based on the analysis of variance test , one can conclude that these two sub - samples are drawn from different distributions with more than 75% confidence .",
    "the weakness of the distinction between the two classes may indicate that the igm evolution timescale is shorter than the mass assembly time ( @xmath13 4 gyrs see * ? ? ? * ) .    another interesting observation based on the vla imaging of the non - spiral dominated systems @xcite is that most of the  mass is contributed by a single  rich spiral galaxy , except for in the case of hcg  97 and hcg  37 , where no  was observed in the vla imaging .",
    "in all the cases , the  rich spiral galaxy is relatively undisturbed and shows no sign of tidal interaction .",
    "interactions in galaxies can be seen in terms of disturbed  morphology even when they are well away from the center of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the most plausible explanation for a galaxy with an undisturbed  distribution in a compact group is that it is new to the group and has not yet passed through the group center .",
    "so for all these systems , the vla detected  includes both the tidally stripped hsb gas as well as the  mass of the undisturbed galaxy , thus diluting the excess gas fraction s ability to trace evolution of tidal debris .",
    "this may have caused the excess gas mass fraction in the non - spirals to span a much wider range as seen in figure  [ 3histograms ] .",
    "a total of 26 hcgs have been observed in the 21  cm  emission with the 100-meter gbt .",
    "we detected  in almost all the compact groups with the exception of hcg  35 .",
    "the derived  masses ranged between @xmath117  m@xmath118 . in hcg  40 and hcg  48",
    ", we detected 3 to 5 times the previously detected  ( compiled by vm2001 ) reducing their  deficiencies significantly .",
    "for our distance limited complete sample of 22 hcgs , we compared our gbt spectra with the corresponding vla spectra for the region covered by the gbt beam .",
    "strong differences between the two spectra can be seen for some groups while others showed very little or no differences at all .",
    "the total flux recovered by the gbt was always equal to or larger than that by the vla ( with the exception of hcg  40 ) as expected from correct calibration .",
    "although the gbt had larger line flux , the shape of the two  profiles for most of the groups are quite similar .",
    "there are fine differences in the form of broad faint emission and wing - like emission features that were only detected by the gbt .",
    "we have taken extra steps to ensure that these differences are not a result of calibration errors .",
    "perfect match between the vla and the gbt spectra of hcg  16 , 93 , and others supports our claim of calibration accuracy . by comparing the instrumental properties and data analysis techniques for the two instruments , we infer that this excess  is in the form of a faint diffuse extended neutral igm . in a few groups , spatial filtration of extended  structures of angular size @xmath11912 - 15@xmath35 by the vla",
    "is also plausible .",
    "owing to their high spatial density and low velocity dispersion , tidal interactions are ubiquitous in hcgs .",
    "this results in a substantial deposition of cold gas from the ism of individual galaxies to the hot igm .",
    "the detection of neutral igm in hcgs confirms that the cold tidally stripped filaments and clouds survive the conductive heating and expansion for longer than a typical group dynamical timescale ( @xmath119  400  myrs ) . based on our calculations",
    ", we constrain the radius of an  cloud to be @xmath5 200  pc to survive over the dynamical time of the group .",
    "furthermore , the presence of neutral medium also constrains the temperature of the igm to be lower than 4  @xmath0  10@xmath6  k. we also conclude that the diffuse neutral gas content should increase with interactions between member galaxies and hence is related to the age of the group .",
    "we characterize the excess gas content in terms of the total  content in the galaxy - group .",
    "the excess gas mass fraction , @xmath55= m@xmath107/m@xmath3 , varies from almost none to 81% .",
    "we discovered a much larger fraction of excess gas ( median=51  % ) in slightly  deficient groups as compared to  normal groups ( median=26  % ) or highly  deficient groups ( median=20  % ) . for groups with  deficiency less than 0.4 ( @xmath120 of deficiency estimation ) ,",
    "the excess gas fraction increases with increasing deviation from  normalcy .",
    "the opposite trend is seen in the case of high - surface brightness  detected by the vla .",
    "we conclude that the diffuse neutral gas represents an intermediate stage in the evolution of tidal debris in the hot igm between hsb  and ionized hydrogen .",
    "we also examined the excess gas content in terms of group evolution based on the scenario proposed by vm2001 .",
    "according to this evolutionary scenario , the tidal interactions increasingly deposit ism from individual galaxies into the igm as a group evolves and hence based on the  morphology one can predict the stage of evolution . the tidal debris , which survives the hot igm ,",
    "will evolve into the diffuse neutral igm and is expected to be a substantial fraction of the total  content .",
    "thus the excess  content is expected to be correlated with the evolutionary phase . from our analysis",
    "we found that this is indeed the case .",
    "the groups in the final phase of evolution had a larger amount of excess  ( average of 48% ) as compared to groups in phase 1 ( 21% ) and phase 2 ( 30% ) .",
    "furthermore , we find a clustering in the distribution with only two systems showing the transition phase .",
    "this suggests that the transition is rapid and hints at the presence of a physical threshold like a characteristic age or an interaction threshold aiding the transition .",
    "we also examined the dependence of excess gas content on the hubble type of the central dominant galaxy in the group . while spiral dominated groups tend to be have a lower excess gas mass fraction , the non - spiral dominated groups have a wide range of values covering the entire range .",
    "the existence of cold neutral igm in hcgs offers a strong support for the survival of the tidally stripped ism from individual galaxies . a significant amount of  is tidally stripped from the galaxies as they interact with the group potential and other members and ultimately ends up in the diffuse igm .",
    "thus , the excess gas content gives valuable information on the evolutionary history of groups .",
    "in addition , the neutral gas distribution also holds the key to understanding current and future star formation in groups , which in - turn can considerably change the morphology and spectral properties of the galaxies .",
    "cooler regions of the igm might form clumps with sufficient densities to fall back into the galaxies , and providing them with fresh fuel for star - formation .",
    "the presence of neutral igm also raises the possibility of non - disk star formation .",
    "therefore , this discovery opens up a host of unanswered questions and we hope that a gbt - vla combined map will provide clues to some of these questions .",
    "sensitive x - ray masses and maps along with a uv absorption study of the igm would be the next crucial step in bringing out the full picture .",
