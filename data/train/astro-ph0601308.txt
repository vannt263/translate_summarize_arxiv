    "the milky way galaxy , once apparently satisfactorily described by population i and population ii , is clearly a very complex system ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "substructure in kinematics and in coordinate space indicates accretion of ( formerly ) satellite galaxies ( e.g.  the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal : ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ; ibata et al .  1997 ; majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) and disruption of star clusters ( e.g.  odenkirchen et al .",
    "merger and assimilation of satellite galaxies is an inherent part of the formation of large galaxies , like the milky way , in the now - canonical @xmath4-cold - dark - matter cosmological models .",
    "indeed thick disks of spiral galaxies are most probably relics from an early merger of the evolving thin disk and a smaller satellite galaxy ( see wyse 2005 for a recent discussion of the possibilities ) , and thus contain unique clues about the early stages of disk galaxy formation",
    ".    models of the formation of thick disks through heating of a thin disk by ( dissipationless ) mergers usually invoke a satellite of 10 - 20% of the mass of the ( pre - existing ) stellar disk ( e.g.  velaquez & white 1999 ; walker , mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "the outer parts of the satellites are removed by tidal forces , limited by the relative densities of the satellite and larger system ( essentially a roche - jacobi criterion ) .",
    "the fate of this debris has been largely ignored in the models , but it is clear that material stripped by tidal forces continues on orbits close to that of the center of mass of the satellite at the time of removal .",
    "thus , for typical satellite / subhalo initial orbital angular momentum that is close to half that of a circular orbit of the same energy ( e.g.  benson 2005 ; zentner et al .",
    "2005 ) one would expect an azimuthal streaming velocity of around 100km / s for satellite debris in a system like the milky way with a flat rotation ( circular velocity ) curve , with amplitude @xmath5  km / s .",
    "identification of this satellite debris would provide strong evidence for a merger history of the thick disk .",
    "first indications of a population that could be ascribed to debris from the satellite whose merger caused the thick disk was presented by gilmore , wyse & norris ( 2002 ; hereafter gwn ) .",
    "this population was identified in a survey of faint ( apparent v - band magnitude @xmath6 ) f / g stars in two lines of sight at intermediate latitude , at longitude @xmath7 .",
    "the primary signature was kinematics distinct from those of the canonical thick disk , and distinct from the stellar halo , with mean azimuthal streaming velocity @xmath0km / s .",
    "further analysis ( norris et al .  2006 ) has derived a characteristic metallicity about a factor of ten below the canonical thick disk , and more characteristic of stars in dwarf galaxies . but is this a pervasive population , reasonably well - mixed as expected if indeed it resulted from a merger that took place many gyr ago ?",
    "a side benefit of the recent effort to obtain detailed internal kinematics across the face of local dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies is reasonably large samples of ` contaminating ' stars in the milky way , along the line - of - sight to the target dwarf galaxy .",
    "the cardinal longitudes @xmath1 and @xmath8 , where the radial velocity is most sensitive to azimuthal velocity ( and hence orbital angular momentum , given a distance ) , are of particular importance .",
    "we here analyse the non - member stars from our large surveys of the draco dsph ( @xmath9 ) , the ursa minor dsph ( @xmath10 ) , and the carina dsph ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the data were taken , in order of sample size , from surveys with the vlt / flames , wht / wyffos and keck / hires , and have typical radial velocity errors of less than 3km / s .",
    "the stars that were observed were selected from color - magnitude diagrams of each dsph to be giants at the distance of that galaxy , with a bright magnitude limit of @xmath12 and faint limit of @xmath13 , with a mild trend , following the giant branch , that fainter stars are bluer .",
    "the surveys of the draco dsph and the umi dsph are described in wilkinson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , while that of the carina dsph is described in wilkinson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and in koch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in general dsph",
    "have low velocity dispersions , @xmath14  km / s , and our membership probabilities were based on iterative gaussian fitting to the radial velocity distributions .",
    "the member , and non - member , stars for each line - of - sight are shown in the color - radial velocity plane in fig .  1 .",
    "the non - members are expected to be predominantly dwarf stars within the milky way at typical distances of a few , to several , kiloparsec . as may be seen in the figure , in the draco dsph line - of - sight the member stars are well - separated from the field stars but for the carina and umi dsph lines - of - sight we may well have incorrectly assigned a small number of actual field stars as high - probability galaxy members . in the analysis below",
    ", this would result in a ( small ) deficit of stars in the carina line - of - sight with azimuthal streaming velocity @xmath15  km / s and in the umi line - of - sight a ( small ) deficit of stars with @xmath16  km / s .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ kinematic selection bias in the non - member stars .",
    "the lines - of - sight are ideal to probe the orbital angular momentum of the galactic stars . defining @xmath17 to be the heliocentric radial ( line - of - sight ) velocity of a given star , then with @xmath18 being the galactocentric radial velocity of a given star , i.e.  the component of the star s galactocentric velocity along the line - of sight from the sun to the star",
    ", we have @xmath19 the second term here is the component of the sun s peculiar motion in the line - of - sight to the star , and we have assumed that the lsr has a circular orbit of 220  km / s about the galactic center .",
    "we adopted a solar peculiar motion of 15.4  km / s in the direction of ( @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath18 may then be decomposed as @xmath21 , where the coefficients are functions of galactocentric distance plus angular coordinates , and are defined in equations 3 - 7 of morrison , freeman & flynn ( 1990 ; hereafter mff ) . with the assumption of zero means in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 motions ,",
    "@xmath24 for a given star is an unbiased estimate of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , for a solar distance of 3  kpc ( a typical derived value below ) , @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28    implementation of these formulae requires distances .",
    "we utilised two isochrones from bergbusch & vandenberg ( 2001 ) , with color - effective temperature relations from vandenberg & clem ( 2003 ) , and assumed that the stars are main sequence dwarfs ( we discuss possible subgiant contamination in section  4 below ) .",
    "we adopted the v@xmath29i , @xmath30 relation corresponding to 12  gyr old populations with @xmath31 = + 0.3}$ ] and firstly @xmath32 = -0.525}$ ] and secondly @xmath32 = -1.525}$ ] .",
    "the first was chosen since it corresponds to a large fraction of local thick disk stars ( bensby et al .",
    "2005 ) , while the second was chosen since this metallicity corresponds to the stars with intermediate kinematics from gwn , as well as to the ` metal - weak thick disk ' ( e.g.  mff ; chiba & beers 2000 ) and to the stellar halo .",
    "individual distances can not be taken as reliable , but the overall derived distributions should be representative .",
    "the reddenings in the lines - of - sight of interest are all small , @xmath33 ( schlegel et al .  1998 ) , and are ignored in the analysis .",
    "the derived distances for the vast majority of the stars are less than 5  kpc , with a typical distance being 23  kpc . at the faint magnitudes",
    "we analyse below , the redder stars are most likely to be in the thin disk  thick disk interface , with the bluer ones in the thick disk  halo interface .",
    "_ carina line - of - sight , @xmath11 : _    the line - of - sight to the carina dsph contains the largest sample of non - member stars , 619 stars with apparent magnitudes in the range @xmath34 and with color in the range @xmath35 .",
    "the vast majority are most probably normal disk stars .",
    "we here are most interested in the bluer , fainter stars .",
    "we are also interested in a comparison of the derived @xmath25 distributions in the three dwarf spheroidal lines - of - sight , and this is facilitated with a similar color range for all three .",
    "we therefore pruned the sample to the 89 stars with @xmath36 and with color in the range @xmath37 .",
    "the carina input sample was derived from the @xmath38 distribution , and the @xmath39 selection here was adopted to compare with the other two lines - of - sight , which utilised the @xmath40 distribution .",
    "the histogram of derived individual estimates of @xmath41 for this ` g star sample ' is shown in figure  2 , for each of the two isochrones , together with the distribution in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "note that the bin size , 20  km / s , is chosen to provide significant numbers of stars per bin , and is more than four times the line - of - sight velocity uncertainty .",
    "the narrow peak at @xmath42  km / s , with the shoulder at @xmath43  km / s is due to the thin disk plus canonical thick disk ( see table  1 ) .",
    "there is a rather high tail through @xmath3  km / s , towards @xmath15  km / s .",
    "these results are insensitive to the adopted metallicity ( compare the solid and dashed histograms in the figure ) .",
    "the thick disk / halo interface , of most interest to probe satellite debris , is best probed by the stars with @xmath44 .",
    "figure  3 shows the velocity histogram of these 49 stars ( all fainter than @xmath45 ) compared with the 1043 stars ( also @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) in the field at @xmath48 that formed part of the sample of gwn .",
    "given the difference in latitude , and the resultant difference in projection of @xmath25 into the line - of - sight , the agreement is good .",
    "_ draco line - of - sight , @xmath9 _ :    the 207 non - member stars in this line of sight cover the apparent magnitude range @xmath49 , and colors as shown in fig .  1 . we selected a ` g - star sample ' consisting of the 82 stars with @xmath50 and with color in the range @xmath51 .",
    "their derived @xmath25 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "2 , again with the @xmath40 color - magnitude diagram ( the effects of the selection of stars following the locus of a red giant branch have not been entirely removed by these cuts ) .",
    "the histograms are similar to those in the carina line - of - sight , except that the narrow peak is at the canonical thick disk mean @xmath52  km / s .",
    "again the results are insensitive to the metallicity of the adopted isochrones .",
    "this agreement with the carina line - of - sight and the earlier gwn data is all the more important since this draco line - of - sight is at opposite galactic longitude , @xmath53 as opposed to @xmath54 .",
    "_ umi line - of - sight , @xmath55 _ :    the 105 non - member stars in this line of sight cover the apparent magnitude range @xmath56 , with @xmath39 distribution shown in fig .  1 , we again selected a ` g - star sample ' , this time consisting of the 42 stars with @xmath57 and again with color in the range @xmath51 .",
    "their derived @xmath25 distribution and cmd are shown in fig .",
    "2 , ( again the effects of the initial selection of red giant stars in the dsph have not been entirely removed by these cuts ) .",
    "the effects of small number statistics limit the interpretation of the histograms but the distribution is clearly rather broad .",
    "once more the results are insensitive to the metallicity of the adopted isochrones .",
    "again , we note that this umi line - of - sight is at galactic longitude @xmath53 , as opposed to @xmath58 .",
    "a direct comparison of the velocities with predictions is not trivial due to the non - standard selection function of the samples , which were chosen for reasons having nothing to do with studying the galaxy .",
    "however , the narrower color range of the ` g - star ' samples alleviates this to some extent ( and was chosen with a model comparison in mind ) . assuming uniform sampling across the color - magnitude ranges selected , each of the ` g - star ' samples in the draco and umi lines - of - sight",
    "should , from the gilmore star - count model ( gilmore 1981 ) , be a mix of thin disk , thick disk and halo in the ratio @xmath59 .",
    "this is consistent with the derived distances , which correspond to mean @xmath60height above the galactic plane of @xmath61  kpc for the [ fe / h ] @xmath62 isochrone , and @xmath63  kpc for the [ fe / h ] @xmath64 isochrone .",
    "the stars in the carina line - of - sight should be a mix of @xmath65 , again consistent with our derived mean height above the galactic plane of 1.5  kpc for the [ fe / h ] @xmath66 isochrone and 1.1  kpc for the @xmath67 isochrone .",
    "the highest statistical significance comes from the sum of all three lines - of - sight , and the lower right panel of fig .",
    "2 shows a simple sum of the three individual histogram , together with a model curve that is the sum of three gaussians to represent the thin and thick disks and halo , with means and sigmas given in table  1 , in the ratios of 0.1:1:0.25 ( as a compromise fit to the main thin disk / thick disk peak at @xmath68  km / s ) . there is a clear excess , compared to the model , of stars with @xmath69  km / s .",
    "this excess is robust to rebinning ( the structure around the peak at @xmath42  km / s is more sensitive ) .",
    "the usual kolmogorov - smirnoff test for comparisons of data and models is most sensitive to regions with most stars , and thus application to the entire distribution is dominated by the peak at around @xmath42  km / s , where the agreement is reasonable .",
    "we have instead applied the ks test to a restricted range of @xmath25 , finding for @xmath70  km / s there is a 99% probability that the data are from a different distribution than the model .",
    "we obtain similar excesses at @xmath3  km / s ( but with lower significance due to small number statistics ) from the @xmath71 carina line - of - sight alone , and from a sum of the @xmath72 draco and umi lines - of - sight .",
    "the addition of a component with @xmath73  km / s and @xmath74  km / s , and with normalisation equal to that of the stellar halo , greatly improves the fit .",
    "one is required to adopt rather extreme kinematics for the canonical components of the galaxy to avoid the addition of this extra component ; for example , increasing both the thin disk and thick disk dispersions and adopting a mean rotational streaming of 30  km / s for the halo . even with this",
    ", one can not obtain a good fit to the distributions , but rather introduce a significant over - prediction in the model around @xmath75  km / s",
    ". vertical gradients in @xmath76 for the thick disk have been discussed ( e.g.  mff , chiba & beers 2000 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2006 ) but none predicts as low a value of @xmath77  km / s at @xmath78  kpc .",
    "there are several possible effects that could complicate the interpretation of the above analysis .",
    "first , imperfect subtraction of the several strong sky lines in the observed data could have produced spurious radial velocities at certain values set by the wavelength of the sky line .",
    "we found that the strongest spurious signal ( itself weak ) in the cross - correlation peak would be expected at @xmath79  km / s and @xmath80  km / s , far from our reported signal .",
    "we assumed that all stars were dwarfs when estimating distances . for the isochrones we adopted , subgiants with @xmath81 are some 23 magnitudes brighter in the v - band than are the main sequence stars of the same color . at the apparent magnitudes of interest",
    ", subgiants would lie at distances of 1015  kpc .",
    "the resultant deprojections of the line - of - sight velocity into @xmath25 would shift the peak at @xmath42  km / s ( see fig .  2 ) to @xmath82  km / s , incompatible with all other surveys of the thick disk  thin disk interface .",
    "the @xmath83  km / s peak contains stars of all colors , as does the velocity range around @xmath0  km / s , as may be inferred from fig .  1 ( remembering the typical @xmath84 ) .",
    "clearly subgiant contamination must be minor , in line with the expectations from stellar evolution that this phase is short - lived compared to the main sequence , and with observed luminosity functions .",
    "we have adopted isochrones based on our knowledge of chemical abundances in the thick - disk  halo interface , but clearly metallicity determinations for the non - member stars would be extremely useful , particularly to investigate any possible connection to the ` metal - weak thick disk ' ( e.g.  chiba & beers 2000 ; mff ) .",
    "this is being investigated .",
    "we have shown that faint f / g stars , @xmath6 , at intermediate latitudes , consistently show a population with mean azimuthal streaming that corresponds to a lag behind the sun of @xmath85  km / s .",
    "this is dissimilar to the value for the canonical thick disk and to the value for the canonical stellar halo .",
    "we selected stars in restricted ranges of color and magnitude , in both @xmath54 and @xmath86 , so that modulo metallicities , the stars are typically at a few kiloparsecs from the sun , and one can infer that we have found a population of intermediate angular momentum .",
    "this population is detected in a wide range of galactic latitude and longitude .",
    "indeed , the k - giant sample of mff also shows indications of this population , particularly for [ fe / h ] @xmath87 ( see their figure  7 ( d ) and ( g ) ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , this mean rotational velocity is what one would expect for debris from a typical shredded satellite .",
    "the thick disk may well have been caused by the most massive merger suffered by the milky way since the onset of star formation in the thin disk . in this case",
    ", the debris from the satellite implicated in this ` minor merger ' would dominate over other debris .",
    "we propose that this is indeed the case , and interpret our observations as tracing the remains of the satellite whose merger with the milky way created the thick disk .",
    "we intend to make detailed comparisons with simulations of the merger process to constrain further this last significant merger of the milky way .",
