    "gauss curvature @xmath0 of thermodynamical metrics ( in energy or entropy form ) was calculated for several td systems with two degrees of freedom ( i.e. 5-dim phase space @xmath19 ) - ideal gas ( @xmath78 ) , takahashi gas , multi - component ideal gas , paramagnetic ideal gas , van - der - waals gas , ideal quantum gases(see review @xcite ) .",

    "then @xmath88 notice that homogeneity condition for any constitutive relation in u - system ( @xcite ) leads to the relation @xmath89 that should be fulfilled for all integral surfaces of contact structure @xmath22 given by a constitutive equation .",
    "correspondingly , contact condition for thermodynamical processes has two forms , i.e. @xmath90 where the second one ( gibbs - duhem equation , see @xcite ) leads to the second form of constitutive relation provided the constitutive relation in the first ( fundamental ) form is chosen .    calculating the weinhold metric of u - system we will use some notations standard in the literature ( see @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath15 is the isothermal compressibility : @xmath96    these quantities are related by : @xmath97    calculating weinhold metric for u - system on the two - dimensional integral surface @xmath98 and using introduced notations we get    @xmath99    characteristic equation of tensor @xmath100 ( with respect to the canonical euclidian metric @xmath101 on the @xmath102-plane ) is    @xmath103    and @xmath104\\ ] ] for the discriminant @xmath105 we have the following inequality    @xmath106    which , in particular , implies that    @xmath107    notice that since @xmath108 , discriminant @xmath109 is always positive .",

    "considering just the contribution to the magnetic work due to the magnetic dipole moment @xmath149 , let s define the ( internal ) energy to be    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the component of the total magnetic moment parallel to the external field .",
    "then    @xmath152    @xmath153    where @xmath154 is the permittivity of free space .",
    "then the weinhold metric for the system with constitutive relation ( 3.26 ) in the space of variables @xmath155 is    @xmath156    similarly , for the work of a homogeneous external electrical field @xmath157 in homogeneous case we have ( @xcite )    @xmath158    where @xmath159 is the total electric dipole moment .",
    "similarly to the previous case , if we consider just the contribution to the electric work due to the electric dipole moment , we can define the internal energy as follows    @xmath160    then    @xmath161    where    @xmath162    @xmath163 is the component of the electric moment parallel to the external field .",
