    "to obtain information about unresolved stellar populations in galaxies , one can look at colours , ranging from the uv to the infrared . such a method is popular especially when studying faint objects .",
    "since colours are strongly affected by dust extinction , one prefers to use spectra when studying brighter objects .",
    "these have the additional advantage that abundances of various elements can be studied , from the strength of absorption lines ( e.g. rose 1985 ; snchez - blazquez et al . 2003 ; carretero et al .",
    "although the uv and the near ir are promising wavelength regions to study , the large majority of spectral studies is done in the optical , mainly because of our better understanding of the region . to obtain information ,",
    "one generally compares model predictions with measurements of strong absorption line strengths .",
    "this method , which is insensitive to the effects of dust extinction ( e.g. , macarthur 2005 ) very often uses the lick / ids system of indices , which comprises definitions of 25 absorption line strengths in the optical spectral range , originally defined on a low resolution stellar library ( fwhm@xmath18 - 11 ) ( gorgas et al . 1993 , worthey et al . 1994 , worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) .",
    "there is an extensive list of publications in which this method has been applied , mainly for early - type galaxies ( see for example the compilation provided in trager et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "predictions for the line - strength indices of the integrated light of stellar clusters and galaxies are obtained with stellar population synthesis models .",
    "these models calculate galaxy indices by adding the contributions of all possible stars , in proportions prescribed by stellar evolution models .",
    "the required indices of all such stars are obtained from observed stellar libraries , but since the spectra in these libraries were often noisy , and did not contain all types of stars present in galaxies , people used the so - called fitting functions , which relate measured line - strength indices to the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , ) of library stars .",
    "the most widely used fitting functions are those computed on the basis of the lick / ids stellar library ( burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; gorgas et al .",
    "1993 ; worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) there are , however , alternative fitting functions in the optical range ( e.g. , buzzoni 1995 ; gorgas et al . 1999 ; tantalo , chiosi & piovan 2007 ; schiavon 2007 ) and in other spectral ranges ( e.g. , cenarro et al .",
    "2002 ; mrmol - queralt et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the most important parameters that can be obtained using stellar population synthesis are age ( as a proxy for the star formation history ) and metallicity ( the average metal content ) .",
    "there are several methods to perform stellar population analysis based on these indices . by far",
    "the most popular method is to build key diagnostic model grids by plotting an age - sensitive indicator ( e.g. h@xmath4 ) versus a metallicity - sensitive indicator ( e.g. , mg@xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , to estimate the age and metallicity ( e.g. trager et al .",
    "2000 ; kuntschner et al .",
    "there are other methods that , e.g. , employ as many lick indices as possible and simultaneous fit them in a @xmath7 sense ( e.g. , vazdekis et al .",
    "1997 ; proctor et al . 2004 ) .",
    "an alternative method is the use of principal component analysis ( e.g. covino et al . 1995 ; wild et al . 2009 ) .    in the last decade",
    "the appearance of a generation of stellar population models that predict full spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at moderately high spectral resolution has provided new means for improving the stellar population analysis ( e.g. , vazdekis 1999 , hereafter v99 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ; le borgne et al .",
    "these models employ newly developed extensive empirical stellar spectral libraries with flux - calibrated spectral response and good atmospheric parameter coverage . among the most popular stellar libraries",
    "are those of jones ( 1999 ) , cat ( cenarro et al . 2001a ) , elodie ( prugniel & soubiran 2001 ) , stelib ( le borgne et al .",
    "2003 ) , indo - us ( valdes et al .",
    "2004 ) , and miles ( snchez - blzquez et al . 2006d , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "models that employ such libraries are , e.g. , vazdekis ( 1999 ) , vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( hereafter v03 ) , bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , le borgne et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . alternatively",
    ", theoretical stellar libraries at high spectral resolutions have also been developed for this purpose ( e.g. , murphy & meiksin 2004 ; zwitter et al .",
    "2004 ; rodrguez - merino et al . 2005 ; munari et al . 2005 ; coelho et al . 2005 ; martins & coelho 2007 ) .",

    "( 2000 ) , gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , coelho et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "there are important limitations inherent to the method that prevent us from easily disentangling relevant stellar population parameters .",
    "the most important one is the well known age / metallicity degeneracy , which not only affects colours but also absorption line - strength indices ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) .",
    "this degeneracy is partly due to the isochrones and partly due to the fact that line - strength indices change with both age and metallicity .",
    "the effects of this degeneracy are stronger when low resolution indices are used , as the metallicity lines appear blended .",
    "alternative indices that were thought to work at higher spectral resolutions , such as those of rose ( 1985 , 1994 ) , have been proposed to alleviate the problem .",
    "new indices with greater abilities to lift the age / metallicity degeneracy have been proposed with the aid of the new full - sed models ( e.g. , vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ; cervantes & vazdekis 2009 ) .",
    "these models allow us to analyze the whole information contained in the observed spectrum at once .",
    "in fact , there is a growing body of full spectrum fitting algorithms that are being developed for constraining and recovering in part the star formation history ( e.g. , panter et al . 2003 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2005 ; ocvirk et al . 2006ab ; koleva et al .",
    "furthermore the use of these ssp seds , which have sufficiently high spectral resolution , has been shown to significantly improve the analysis of galaxy kinematics both in the optical ( e.g. , sarzi et al . 2006 ) and in the near - ir ( e.g. , falcn - barroso et al .",
    "2003 ) , for both absorption and emission lines .    here",
    "we present single - age , single - metallicity stellar population ( ssp ) seds based on the empirical stellar spectral library miles that we presented in paper  i ) and cenarro et al .",

    "these models represent an extension of the v99 seds to the full optical spectral range .",
    "these miles - models are meant to provide better predictions in the optical range for intermediate- and old - stellar populations . in paper",
    "i we provided all relevant details for miles , which has been obtained at the 2.5  m issac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma .",
    "the library is composed of 985 stars covering the spectral range @xmath8 3540 - 7410  at 2.3  ( fwhm ) .",
    "miles stars were specifically selected for population synthesis modeling . in paper",
    "ii we present a homogenized compilation of the stellar parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , ) for the stars of this library .",
    "in fact the parameter coverage of miles constitutes a significant improvement over previous stellar libraries and allows the models to safely extend the predictions to intermediate - aged stellar populations and to lower and higher metallicities .",
    "the models that we present here are based on an empirical library , i.e. observed stellar spectra , and therefore the synthesized seds are imprinted with the chemical composition of the solar neighbourhood , which is the result of the star formation history experienced by our galaxy . as the stellar isochrones ( girardi et al .",
    "i.e. the other main ingredient feeding the population synthesis code  are solar - scaled , our models are self - consistent , and scaled - solar for solar metallicity . in the low metallicity regime , however , our models combine scaled - solar isochrones with stellar spectra that do not show this abundance ratio pattern ( e.g. , edvardsson et al . 1993 ; schiavon 2007 ) . in a second paper",
    "we will present self - consistent models , both scaled - solar and @xmath9-enhanced , for a range in metallicities .",
    "for this purpose we have used miles , together with theoretical model atmospheres , which are coupled to the appropriate stellar isochrones .",
    "we note , however , that the use of our ( base ) models , which are not truly scaled - solar for low metallicities , does not affect in a significant manner the metallicity and age estimates obtained from galaxy spectra in this metallicity regime ( e.g. , michielsen et al .",
    "2008 ) . for the high metallicity regime , where massive galaxies reside and show enhanced ratios , the observed line - strengths for various popular indices ( e.g. , mg@xmath5 , fe5270 ) are significantly different from the scaled - solar predictions .",
    "it has been shown that by changing the relative element - abundances , and making them @xmath9-enhanced , both the stellar models ( e.g. , salaris , groenewegen & weiss 2000 ) and the stellar atmospheres ( e.g. tripicco & bell 1995 ; korn , maraston & thomas 2005 ; cohelo et al .",
    "2007 ) are affected .",
    "however it has also been shown that base models , such as the ones we are presenting here , can be used to obtain a good proxy for the abundance ratio , if appropriate indices are employed for the analysis ( e.g. yamada et al .",

    "( 2000 ) adopt a simple synthetic prescription that , for example , does not take into account the third dredge - up .",
    "an improved treatment for this difficult stellar evolutionary phase has been recently included by marigo et al .",
    "the effects of such improvements become relevant for the near - ir spectral range ( see e.g. , marigo et al .",
    "2008 ; maraston 2005 ) .",
    "the theoretical parameters of the isochrones @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are transformed to the observational plane by means of empirical relations between colours and stellar parameters ( temperature , metallicity and gravity ) , instead of using theoretical stellar atmospheres .",

    "each of these libraries are composed of @xmath13  500 stars and the obtained temperature scales are based on the ir - flux method , i.e. only marginally dependent on model atmospheres .",
    "we use the empirical compilation of lejeune , cuisinier & buser ( 1997 , 1998 ) ( and references therein ) for the coolest dwarfs ( @xmath14 and giants ( @xmath15 ) for solar metallicity . for these low temperatures we use a semi - empirical approach to other metallicities on the basis of these relations and the model atmospheres of bessell et al .",

    "we adopt @xmath16 and a bolometric magnitude of 4.70 .",

    "further details of the imf definitions are given in appendix  a of v03 .",
    "we set the lower and upper mass - cutoff of the imf to 0.1 and 100m@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "to compute the ssp seds in the full optical spectral range we use the miles library , for which the main characteristics are given in paper  i. the stars of the library were selected to optimize the stellar parameter coverage required for population synthesis modelling .",
    "this is , in fact , one of the major advantages of this library . another important feature of the library is that the stellar spectra were carefully flux - calibrated . to reach this goal ,",
    "all the stars were observed through a wide ( 6@xmath20 ) slit to avoid selective flux losses due to the differential refraction effect , in addition to the higher resolution setups used to achieve the blue and red parts of the stellar spectra .",
    "telluric absorptions that were present in the redder part of the spectra were properly removed .",
    "we refer to paper  i for the technical details on how these aspects were tackled .    to prepare this library for its implementation in the models we identified those stars",
    "whose spectra might not be properly representative of a given set of atmospheric parameters .",
    "we used the simbad database for identifying the spectroscopic binaries in the miles sample .",
    "a number of these stars were removed from the original sample as they were found non essential as miles contains sufficient stars with similar atmospheric parameters .",
    "we also checked for those stars with high signal of variability ( @xmath21  mag ) , according to the combined general catalogue of variable stars of kholopov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( the electronically - readable version provided at cds ) . some stars with signs of variability",
    "were removed , when no such high variability was expected according to their spectral types and atmospheric parameters and , at the same time , we were able to identify alternative stars in the library with similar parameters and no such sign of variability .",
    "various stars were discarded because emission lines were detected in their spectra .",
    "for various technical reasons we also discarded from the original miles list an additional number of stars : those with very low signal - to - noise in the blue part of the spectrum or for which the atmospheric parameters were lacking or had problems in the continuum .",
    "each stellar spectrum of this selected subsample of stars was compared to a synthetic spectrum of similar atmospheric parameters computed with the algorithm described in v03 ( appendix b ) ( see also [ sec : synthesis ] ) employing the miles stellar library . to perform this test we first excluded from the list the target star for which we wished to synthesize a similar spectrum .",
    "we then compared the synthesized stellar spectrum with the observed one .",
    "this comparison was found to be very useful for identifying stellar spectra with possible problems and , eventually , discard them . in case of doubt , particularly for those regions of parameter space with poorer coverage , we compared the observed spectrum of our star with the spectra of those stars , with the closest atmospheric parameters , which were selected by the algorithm to synthesize our target star .",
    "as an example of this method , fig .",
    "[ fig : interpolator ] shows the results for stars of varying temperature , gravity and metallicity .",
    "according to these careful inspections and tests we marked 135 stars of the miles database . while 60 of these stars were removed from the original sample , we kept 75 stars , which were found to be useful for improving the coverage of certain regions of parameter space .",
    "for the latter , however , we decreased the weight with which they contribute when we synthesize a stellar spectrum for a given set of atmospheric parameters . in practise",
    "this is performed by artificially decreasing their signal - to - noise , according to the prescription adopted in [ sec : synthesis ] . for the interested reader we provide explanatory notes for these stars in an updated table of the miles sample that can be found in * http://miles.iac.es*.      figure[fig : miles - parameters ] shows the parameter coverage of the selected subsample of miles stars for dwarfs and giants ( separated at @xmath22 ) compared with the original miles sample .",
    "the 75 stars with decreased weights are also indicated .",
    "the parameters of miles plotted here are the result of an extensive compilation from the literature , homogenized by taking as a reference the stars in common with soubiran , katz & cayrel ( 1998 ) , which have very well determined atmospheric parameters .",
    "we refer the reader to paper  ii for an extensive description of the method and the adopted parameters . for comparison",
    "we show the parameter coverage of some popular stellar libraries ( stelib : leborgne et al .",

    "for elodie 3.1 we use the parameters determined with the tgmet software ( see prugniel & soubiran 2004 for details ) to maximize the number of plotted stars .",
    "we adopt the mean value for those stars with repeated observations .",
    "[ fig : miles - parameters ] shows that , at solar metallicity , all types of stars are well represented in all libraries . at lower metallicities , however , miles shows a much better coverage of the parameter space for both , dwarfs and giants , than other libraries . particularly relevant",
    "is the presence of dwarfs with temperatures above @xmath23 and metallicities .",
    "with these stars we are in position to overcome a major limitation of current population synthesis models based on empirical stellar libraries providing with predictions for metal - poor stellar populations in the age range 0.1  5gyr . furthermore , there are sufficient stars to compute models for metallicities as low as , particularly for very old stellar populations where the temperature of the turnoff is lower .",
    "another advantage with respect to the other libraries is the coverage of metal - rich dwarf and giant stars that allow us to safely compute ssp seds for .",
    "also for even higher metallicities miles shows a good stellar parameter coverage and , therefore , it is possible to compute seds for .",
    "these predictions will be presented and we will make them available in our website  in a future paper , where we feed the models with the teramo isochrones ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ) , that reach these high metallicity values .    these supersolar metallicity predictions are particularly relevant for studying massive galaxies and it is the first time they can be safely computed , without extrapolating the behaviour of the spectral characteristics of the stars at higher metallicities as it is done , e.g. , in models based on the lick / ids empirical fitting functions ( e.g. worthey 1994 ; thomas et al .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that these new model predictions also extend the range of ssp metallicities and ages of our previous model seds based on the jones ( 1999 ) ( v99 ) and cenarro et al .",

    "we obtain the spectrum for each requested star with a given atmospheric parameters interporlating the spectra of adjacent stars using the algorithm described in v03 .",
    "the code identifies the miles stars whose parameters are enclosed within a given box around the point in parameter space ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , [ m / h]@xmath35 ) . when needed , the box is enlarged in the appropriate directions until suitable stars are found ( for example , less and more metal - rich ) .",
    "this is done by dividing the original box in 8 cubes , all with one corner at that point .",
    "this reduces the errors in case of gaps and asymmetries in the distribution of stars around the point .",
    "the larger the density of stars around the requested point , the smaller the box is .",

    "finally , the combined spectra in the different boxes are used to obtain a spectra with the required atmospheric parameters by weighting for the appropiate quantity . for a full description of the algorithm",
    "we refer the reader to v03 ( appendix b ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , within this scheme , a stellar spectrum is computed according to the requested atmospheric parameters , irrespective of the evolutionary stage .",
    "we are aware that this approach is not fully appropriate for the tp - agb phase , where o - rich , c - rich and stars in the superwind phase are present .",
    "in fact , in mrmol - queralt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we have found non negligible differences in the co bandhead at 2.3@xmath36 between 19 agb stars , all from the miles library , and rgb stars of similar parameters .",
    "this , in principle , could introduce an error in our predictions as very few c - rich , o - rich or superwind phase tp - agb stars can be found in miles .",
    "however , the contribution of such stars to the total flux budget in the v - band is just a few percent , mainly for stellar populations of intermediate - ages ( 0.1  1.5gyr ; see e.g. , bruzual 2007 ) .",
    "percival & salaris ( 2009 ) have recently shown that systematic uncertainties associated with the three fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters might have a non negligible impact on the resulting ssp line - strength indices .",
    "the interested reader is refered to that paper for details and for a suite of tests showing the effects of varying these parameters .",
    "in particular , a relatively small offset in the effective temperature of 50 - 100  k , which is of the order of the systematic errors in the conversion from temperature to colours used here ( alonso et al . 1996 ) may change the age of a 14gyr stellar population by 2 - 3 gyr and alliviate the so - called zero - point problem for which the ages of the globular clusters ( gcs ) are older than the most recent estimations of the age of the universe .",
    "furthermore , they show that , in many cases , there is a mistmatch in scales between the underlying models ( the isochrones ) and the adopted stellar library in the stellar population models .",
    "we showed already in paper  ii that the alonso et al .",

    "a major application of the ssp seds is to produce key line - strength indices that can be compared to the observed values . in practise",

    "the lick / ids system has been very popular because the stellar library contains stars with a fair range of stellar parameters and , therefore , is appropriate to build stellar population models .",
    "the most popular application of this library has been the use of empirical fitting functions , which relate the index strengths , measured at the lick / ids resolution , to the stellar atmosphere parameters . because the value of the lick / ids indices depend on the broadening of the lines , authors with spectral data who wish to use the population models based on the lick / ids fitting functions ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 ; thomas et al .",
    "2003 ) , or compare them with previously published data , need to transform their measurements into the lick / ids system .",
    "as the resolution of the lick / ids library ( fwhm@xmath138 - 11 ) is much lower than what is available with modern spectrographs , the science spectra are usually broadened to the lower lick / ids resolution .",
    "this is performed by convolving with a gaussian function , whose width varies as a function of wavelength , as the resolution of the lick / ids system , apart from being low , also suffers from an ill - defined wavelength dependence ( see worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) .",
    "this effect is particularly significant for systems with small intrinsic velocity dispersions , such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies , for which part of the valuable information contained in the higher resolution galaxy spectra is lost .",
    "after that , it is still necessary to correct the measurements for the line broadening due to the velocity dispersion of the stars in the integrated spectra of galaxies .",
    "the correction should be calculated by finding a good stellar template of the galaxy by combining an appropriate set of stellar or synthetic spectra which matches the observed spectrum .",
    "this is because this correction is highly sensitive to the strength of the index . despite of this",
    ", many studies still use single polynomial obtained with a single star as a template , that may have very different index - values than those on the observed spectra ( see kelson et al .",
    "2006 for a discussion of the systematic effects associated to this procedure ) .    due to the fact that the shape of the continuum in the lick / ids stars is not properly calibrated , the use of the lick system requires a conversion of the observational data to the instrumental response curve of lick / ids dataset ( see the analysis by worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) that will affect , predominantly , the broad indices .",
    "this is usually done by observing a number of lick stars with the same instrumental configuration as for the science objects .",
    "then , by comparing with the tabulated lick index measurements , the authors find empirical correction factors for each index .",
    "this experiment shows that even for the narrow indices , differences exist between the lick / ids stars and other libraries ( see worthey & ottavianni 1997 ; paper  i ) . the origin of these differences is not clear , but they need to be corrected .",
    "furthermore , the spectra of this library have a low effective signal - to - noise ratio due to the significant flat - field noise ( dalle ore et al .",
    "1991 ; worthey et al . 1994 ; trager et al .",
    "this translates into larger random errors in the indices , much larger than in present - day galaxy data .",
    "it is worth noting that the accuracy of the measurements based on the lick system is often limited by these transformations , rather than by the quality of the galaxy data .      with the advent of new stellar libraries , such as miles , with better resolution , better signal - to - noise , larger number of stars and a very complete coverage of the atmospheric parameter space , it is about time to revisit the standard spectrophotometric system at which the indices are measured .",
    "it is not our objective to tell the authors at which resolution the indices need to be measured .",
    "in fact , we recommend to use the flexibility provided by the model ssp seds and compare the measurements performed on each object with models with the same total broadening .",
    "however , this might not be a valid option in many cases , e.g. , when a group of measurements is to be represented together in the same index - index diagram .",
    "it is also convenient to agree on a standard resolution at which to measure line - strengths , so that measurements can be compared easily with previous studies , with colleagues , and to avoid systematic errors that might affect the conclusions .",
    "one of the reasons why the lick / ids system is still popular nowadays is because most previous studies have calculated their indices in this system .",
    "although it is a good standard procedure to compare new measurements with previous works , the fact that those are transformed into the lick / ids systems perpetuates the problem . for this reason , we propose in this section a new line index system , hereafter lis , with three new spectral resolutions at which to measure the lick indices .",
    "note that this new system should not be restricted to the lick set of indices in a flux calibrated system .",
    "in fact , lis can be used for any index in the literature ( e.g. , for the rose ( 1994 ) indices ) , including newly defined indices ( e.g. , cervantes & vazdekis 2009 ) .",
    "we provide conversions to transform the data from the lick / ids system to lis as well as tables with index measurements in the new system for popular samples of milky way globular clusters , nearby elliptical galaxies and bulges . for this purpose",
    "we use index tables already published by other authors , and transform them into the new system . to calculate the conversion , we have broadened the miles stars in common with the lick / ids library ( 218 stars in total ) to the new standard resolutions defined for both , globular clusters and galaxies , and compare the indices measured in both datasets .",
    "third - order polynomials were fitted in all cases .",
    "these transformations are given in appendix  [ ap : transformations ] . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will present empirical fitting functions for the lick indices at these new standard resolutions proposed here .",
    "a preliminary version of these fitting functions can be found in martn - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which were computed at the resolution 2.3  ( fwhm ) .",
    "we concentrate here on the lick / ids suite of indices because it has been the most widely used in the literature .",
    "the definition of this new system using the miles stellar library has two main practical advantages :    * the resolution of the miles stars is constant as a function of wavelength . as a result",
    ", the user will not have to degrade the spectra with a wavelength dependent function .",
    "* additional offsets will not have to be applied to the data , as long as the measurements are flux calibrated ( in a relative sense ) .",
    "therefore the system is universal , and the index measurements straightforward to perform .",
    "it is very difficult to choose an appropriate resolution at which to define a new system , as it depends on the intrinsic broadening of the objects and the instrumental resolution .",
    "the lick / ids indices have been measured in a variety of objects , from globular clusters to giant elliptical galaxies , covering a very wide range in velocity dispersion , and in data with a variety of instrumental resolutions .",
    "the appropriate resolution also depends on which indices are going to be measured ; while some lick / ids indices do not change their sensitivity to age and metallicity with broadening , others ( e.g. ca4227 , fe4531 ) do . for these reasons",

    "the first one has been specifically chosen for stellar clusters and dwarf galaxy data , while the other two are more appropriate for working with massive galaxy spectra .      when choosing a standard resolution at which to compare indices of gcs , we were guided by the resolution of existing high - quality gc data .",

    "the reasons for this choice are twofold :    @xmath95 it matches , roughly , the resolution of the lick / ids system in the h@xmath4  mg triplet region . the indices in this regions ( e.g. , h@xmath4 , mg@xmath5 , fe5270 ) are the most widely used in the literature and , therefore , the measurements in the new system will not differ considerably from previous measurements .",
    "@xmath95 200@xmath96 is roughly the mean velocity dispersion for the early - type galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003a , b , c ) .",
    "this system is particularly appropriate for studies of dwarf and intermediate - mass galaxies , where the total broadening of the spectra ( @xmath97 ) is not higher than @xmath98 at 5000 . in this case , the author will only have to broad their spectra to the proposed total @xmath83 using a gaussian broadening function and measure the indices .",
    "if , on the contrary , the total broadening of the object is higher than this value , the author has the option of using the system lis-14.0 , or to correct his / her measurements to a total broadening of 8.4(fwhm ) using polynomials ( see , e.g. , kuntschner 2000 ; snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "2006a ) .",
    "in a similar way as for lis-5 , previous data in the lick system can be converted into this new system using the polynomials given in table  [ conversion.gal ] .",
    "the third system is defined at a resolution of fwhm=14   ( this corresponds to @xmath99357kms@xmath41 at 5000 ) .",
    "lis-14.0  has been designed especially for the study of massive galaxies . in the spectra obtained for these galaxies the broadening",
    "is dominated by the velocity dispersion of the stars .",
    "the total broadening is higher than the standard lick / ids resolution for which , in order to compare with the models , usually one had to perform a correction due to velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "as mentioned above , this correction is one of the largest sources of systematic errors in the measurement of the indices ( e.g. kelson et al .",
    "2006 ) .    for studies that only analyse the stronger lick indices in a sample of galaxies with velocity dispersions @xmath100 200 kms@xmath41 , we suggest to broaden all the spectra by an amount such that the total resolution ( @xmath101 ) matches fwhm=14 , before measuring the indices , where @xmath102 represents the instrumental resolution and @xmath103 the velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "this will help us to avoid to have to perform any further correction to the indices due to broadening .",
    "fig  [ fig : lis_resolutions ] shows the synthetic spectra of an ssp with 10gyr and solar metallicity broadened to the resolution of the different lis- systems .",
    "the polynomials required to transform the indices on the lick / ids system to this resolution are provided in table  [ conversion.gal3 ] .",
    "most spectrographs keep the resolution constant in units of wavelength , rather than velocity .",
    "therefore , the broadening of the spectra , if done in linear wavelength scale , should be always performed using gaussians of a fixed number of pixels . if the broadening of the data has to be made with a gaussian with a constant width in kms@xmath41 .",
    "then the broadening in the spectra should be performed on a spectrum with a logarithmic wavelength scale .",
    "it is common practise in studies of stellar populations to observe stars in common with the lick / ids library .",
    "this is done to derive offsets to transform the data onto the spectrophotometric system of the lick library .",
    "we stress here that this is necessary , _ only _ because the lick / ids spectra suffer from a number of calibration problems .",
    "however , these offsets will not correct properly any uncertainty in the calibration of the science spectra , as the position of the line - index on the detector changes for extragalactic objects due to their redshift .",

    "the residuals of the comparison for the low - velocity dispersion ( @xmath83 ) , old galaxy , ngc4387 , are very small . for the other galaxy with low @xmath83 but young age , ngc  4489 , the residuals in the blue part are as small as those obtained for ngc4387 .",
    "however , we see a pattern in the residuals at longer wavelengths . if the stars of this galaxy would have formed in two bursts then a characteristic residual pattern would be seen , namely a surplus of light in the blue and a deficit in the red , which is not the case .",
    "the good flux - calibration of the models presented here allows this type of analysis . unlike the other galaxies , the spectrum of ngc4489 was taken in one of the subaru observing runs , for which the correction of the continuum shape to a flux scale is less accurate than is achieved for the observing runs at the wht",
    "the same applies to the feature seen in the residuals at @xmath134225 .      for the most massive galaxies , ngc4473 and ngc4621 we see in fig .",

    "we show here how our base models can be safely used for studying galaxies with non - solar element mixtures .",
    "a good example of such use is shown in the line - strength analysis of yamada et al .",
    "a proxy for the abundance ratio is obtained with the aid of the base model grids and an age indicator that is almost insensitive to metallicity .",
    "if a galaxy spectrum is enhanced in mg / fe , we obtain a higher metallicity when this age indicator is plotted vs. a mg - dominated index than when the index is fe - dominated .",

    "irrespective of the metallicity indicator in use , such optimized age indicators provide orthogonal model grids , and the lines of constant age are essentially horizontal , which means that a given measurement for the age indicator corresponds to a unique age ( see cervantes & vazdekis 2009 ) .",

    "following fig .",
    "[ fig : heuristic ] this translates to @xmath277 on the abundance ratio scale of thomas et al .",
    "note that this [ mg / fe ] abundance scale is also a considerable approximation because _ i ) _ the use of scaled - solar isochrones , _ ii ) _ it is based on three synthetic spectra to model the ssps and _ iii ) _ a fixed element ratio pattern is adopted .",
    "note also that in fig .",
    "[ fig : heuristic ] we combine the results from two different model predictions , and that our method requires extrapolating to higher metallicities to obtain @xmath278 ( see the corresponding plots in yamada et al .",
    "this explains in part the larger dispersion obtained for the higher abundance ratios .",
    "it is worth noting that the newly defined h@xmath264 index of cervantes & vazdekis ( 2009 ) provides similar age disentangling power as the h@xmath260 index , but with the advantage that h@xmath264 requires spectra of similar qualities as usually employed for measuring the standard h@xmath4 index ( see cervantes & vazdekis 2009 ) .",
    "h@xmath4 can also be used for this purpose , but the resulting model grids are significantly less orthogonal , increasing the error bars of the [ z@xmath275/z@xmath276 determinations .",
    "finally , to obtain the total metallicity , these optimized age indicators can be plotted versus the combined indices [ mgfe ] ( gonzlez 1993 ) or [ mgfe] ( thomas et al .",
    "2003 ) , which have been shown to be virtually insensitive to the abundance ratio .    in the second paper of this series we will present an updated version of fig .",
    "[ fig : heuristic ] , where we use both the scaled - solar and the @xmath9-enhanced version of our miles models , in order to be fully consistent .",
    "in addition , these models reach higher metallicities , avoiding in this way the extrapolation that might be required to obtain [ z@xmath275/z@xmath276 .",

    "[ fig : hbeta_jones_miles ] shows that the v99 model grid is significantly more orthogonal than the grid obtained with the miles ssp seds , mainly due to the lower sensitivity of h@xmath4 index to metallicity variations . the miles ssp grid looks , in fact , more similar to the equivalent standard grid obtained on the basis of the empirical fitting functions of worthey et al .",

    "[ fig : galaxies ] the higher resolution spectrum obtained at the william herschel telescope for the central aperture r@xmath279 , i.e. , 1.6arcsec ( yamada et al .",
    "according to the v99 model grid , the observed gradient can be attributed to a decreasing metallicity with increasing galactocentric distance . using the miles ssp grid ,",
    "the gradient can be explained by a combination of increasing age and decreasing metallicity .",
    "we have investigated the possible cause for the differences between the two model grids .",
    "as we use here an updated version for the v99 models , which is now based on the same isochrones and transformations to the observational plane that we employ for the miles models , these two ingredients can not be the the ones we are looking for .",
    "we identified three other possible sources : _",
    "i ) _ intrinsic differences in the spectra of miles and jones ( 1999 ) stellar libraries , mostly around the h@xmath4 feature ( such differences have been quoted before by worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) ; _ ii ) _ differences in the stellar parameters adopted here ( i.e. paper  ii ) and in v99 and _ iii ) _ differences in the algorithms employed for computing / assigning a stellar spectrum to a given set of atmospheric parameters . in order to understand this issue , we synthetized seds using the 245 stars , both in the jones and miles libraries , with the following characteristics : ( a ) models using both stellar libraries . miles and jones.(b ) models using miles spectra assigning them the two set of stellar parameters , those used in v99 and in miles ( c ) models using miles stellar spectra and with both algorthims , the one used in v99 and the new algortihm described in v03 .    for the sake of brevity we do not show here this detailed study but we summarize the main results .",
    "we found that these model differences are mostly originated by the stellar spectrum assignation scheme employed in v99 , which works at a significantly more coarse stellar parameter resolution .",
    "the other aspects described above also have a significant impact , but to a lesser degree .",
    "furthermore the h@xmath4 index measurements on the ssp seds synthesized with the same algorithm but exchanging the stellar spectral libraries are consistent with the h@xmath4 index measurements obtained on a star by star basis .",
    "unfortunately , this problem might have some impact on certain studies that make use of the h@xmath4 index derived from v99 models .",
    "given the improvement on the stellar spectrum assignation scheme used for the miles ssps , we will provide an updated version of the v99 predictions in our website using the new algorithms .",

    "the exploitation of stellar population synthesis models has depended in part on the development of tools by users .",
    "some authors offer software to either help to interpret or aid the user to handle the provided predictions .",
    "a few examples include lector ( v99 ) , galaxev ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) , pgase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997,1999 ) , or ez ages ( graves & schiavon 2008 ) . in an effort to continue and extend these initiatives , we have created a new website ( http://miles.iac.es ) to provide support for using the spectra of both the miles stellar library and the model predictions described in this paper , but also in v99 at 1.8  resolution .",

    "the model / library spectra will be convolved with the observational psf ( typically gaussian ) to match the spectral resolution of the observed data . during this step ,",
    "particular attention will be paid as to whether the user requires the fwhm to be constant as a function of wavelength ( in which case convolution will be performed in linear space ) , or constant in velocity ( in which case convolution will be performed in logarithmic space ) . finally , the data will be rebinned ( i.e. spectrally sampled , and if desired , in log scale ) .",

    "here we present stellar population model seds based on the empirical stellar spectral library miles . in paper",
    "i we have presented and described this library , whereas in paper  ii we have published the stellar parameter determinations . here",
    "we present synthetic seds for single - age , single - metallicity stellar populations ( ssps ) covering the full optical spectral range , 3540.57409.6 , at moderately high resolution , fwhm@xmath02.3 , which is virtually constant as a function of wavelength ( see fig .  4 of paper  i ) .",
    "the ssp seds have a reliable , accurate flux calibration , which is one of the major advantages of the miles library .",
    "furthermore the redder part of the ssp spectra do not show telluric residuals , as these were carefully cleaned from the stellar spectra as shown in paper  i.    we consider the seds presented here as our base models , as they combine an empirical library , which is imprinted with the chemical composition of the solar neighbourhood , with scaled - solar stellar isochrones ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) . therefore , whereas our models are self - consistent , and scaled - solar for solar metallicity , this is not the case for the low metallicity regime , as the observed stars there do not show this abundance pattern ( see schiavon 2007 ) . in a second paper",
    "we will present self - consistent models , both scaled - solar and @xmath9-enhanced , for a range in metallicities . for this purpose",
    "we have used miles , together with theoretical model atmospheres , which are coupled to the appropriate stellar isochrones .",
    "an interesting feature of our base models is that they rely , as much as possible , on empirical ingredients .",
    "apart from using miles stellar spectra , we also use transformations of the theoretical parameters of the isochrones to observational , measurable , quantities that are based on extensive empirical , photometric libraries , with marginal dependence on model atmospheres .",
    "the implementation of miles in the population synthesis code has been done very carefully : each star of the library has been compared with other miles stars with similar atmospheric parameters , using the same interpolation algorithm used in the synthesis code . as a result of these tests and other considerations ,",
    "we have removed or decreased the weight with which a given star contributes to the synthesis of a stellar spectrum for 135 ( out of 985 ) stars of miles .    the unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of the miles library has allowed us to safely extend our optical ssp seds from intermediate to very old age regimes ( 0.0618gyr ) and the metallicity coverage of the ssps from supersolar ( ) to .",
    "the very low metallicity ssps should be of particular interest for globular cluster studies .",
    "in addition , we have computed ssp seds for a suite of imf shapes and slopes : unimodal and bimodal imf shapes as defined in vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with slopes varying in the range 0.3 - 3.3 ( salpeter : unimodal with slope 1.3 ) , and the segmented imfs of kroupa ( 2001 ) ( universal and revised cases ) .",
    "in addition to our reference models , which adopt the miles temperatures published in paper  ii , we provide an alternative set of models that adopt the recently published temperature scale of gonzlez - hernndez & bonifacio ( 2009 ) ( i.e. , about @xmath1351k hotter ) .",
    "the most relevant feature of these models is that the well known model zero - point problem affecting the age estimates obtained from the balmer lines , i.e. the obtained ages are larger than the cmd - derived ages , is partially alleviated .    to constrain the range of ages , metallicities and imfs where the use of these seds are safe",
    ", we provide a quantitative analysis .",
    "this analysis , which basically takes into account the parameter coverage of the stellar library feeding the models , clearly shows that our ssp seds can be safely used in the age range 0.0618gyr , and for all the metallicities , except for , for which only stellar populations with ages above @xmath1310gyr can be considered safe .",
    "this applies to the standard imf shapes .",
    "however our quantitative analysis has shown that the quality of the ssp seds decreases as we increase the imf slope , especially for the unimodal imf .",
    "for example , for slopes above 1.8 , the synthesized ssp seds for are no longer safe for a unimodal imf . according to this analysis",
    "our predictions are of significantly higher quality than any previous model predictions in the literature for all the ages and metallicities that have been computed in this work .",
    "for example , any predictions based on the standard fitting functions of the lick / ids system ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) , e.g. line - strength indices , with which most stellar population studies have been performed so far , should not be considered safe for ( for standard imf shapes ) .",
    "this limit is set at higher metallicity , , for predictions based on stelib ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the comparison of our new models , based on miles , with the ssp seds published in v99 , reveals systematic differences due to limitations in the flux calibration of the jones ( 1999 ) stellar library that feeds the latter models . as for the line - strengths the most important difference between these two models is found for the h@xmath4 index , which shows a lower metallicity sensitivity in the v99 models .",
    "we show an example where this effect has a non - negligible impact on our interpretation of galaxy age / metallicity gradients .",
    "the ssp seds increase our ability to perform the stellar populations analysis , which can be done in a very flexible manner .",
    "observed spectra can be studied by fitting the full spectrum or by focussing on selected line indices , either standard or newly defined .",
    "an example of the previous method can be found in koleva et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where various stellar populations models were compared following this approach .",
    "our favourite approach is to analyze the spectrum of a galaxy at the resolution imposed by its velocity dispersion ( and its instrumental resolution ) , which require us to smooth the ssp seds to match the observed total resolution .",
    "therefore , the line index analysis to obtain relevant stellar population parameters is performed in the system of the galaxy , either through full spectrum fitting or line index approaches .",
    "as many authors prefer to plot the line - strength measurements of their whole galaxy sample in a single index - index diagnostic diagram , or to compare their data to tabulated indices in the literature , we propose a new line index system ( lis ) , which makes this method straightforward to apply .",
    "with lis we avoid the well known uncertainties inherent to the widely employed lick / ids system . unlike the latter , lis has two main advantages , i.e. , a constant resolution as function of wavelength and a universal flux - calibrated spectral response .",
    "data can be analyzed in this system at three different resolutions : 5 , 8.4  and 14  ( fwhm ) , i.e. @xmath99127 , 214 and 357@xmath280 at 5000 , respectively .",
    "these resolutions are appropriate for studying globular cluster , low and intermediate - mass galaxies , and massive galaxies , respectively .",
    "line - strength measurements given at a higher lis resolution can be smoothed to match a lower lis resolution .",
    "furthermore we provide polynomials to transform current lick / ids line - index measurements in the literature to the new system .",
    "we provide lis line - index tables for various popular samples of galactic globular clusters and galaxies .",
    "we also show various popular index - index diagnostic diagrams for these samples in the lis system .    as an application",
    ", we have fitted a number of representative stellar clusters of varying ages and metallicities with our models , obtaining good agreement with cmd determinations . unlike for the open cluster m67 ,",
    "our sed fits for a sample of galactic globular clusters show non negligible residuals blueward of 4300 , which mostly reflect the characteristic cn - strong features of these clusters among other deviations from the scaled - solar pattern .",
    "we also applied our models to representative galaxies with high quality spectra , for which independent studies are available , obtaining good results .",
    "we show that our base models can be used for studying line - strength indices of galaxies with @xmath9-enhanced element partitions .",
    "examples of such a use can be found in , e.g. , vazdekis et al .",

    "( 2002 ) , carretero et al .",

    "the method consists in plotting a highly sensitive age indicator , such as those of vazdekis & arimoto ( 1999 ) , or the recently defined h@xmath281 index of cervantes & vazdekis ( 2009 ) versus mg ( e.g. , mg@xmath5 ) and versus fe ( e.g. , fe4383 , @xmath6 ) , obtaining a virtually orthogonal model grid where the estimated age does not depend on the metallicity indicator in use . unlike the age , for a enhanced galaxy",
    "the obtained metallicities differ when plotted against , for example , mg@xmath5 and @xmath6 indices .",

    "our fits to the stellar cluster and galaxy spectra of high quality have confirmed the high precision of the flux calibration of our ssp seds .",

    "<S> we present synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for single - age , single - metallicity stellar populations ( ssps ) covering the full optical spectral range at moderately high resolution ( fwhm@xmath02.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these seds constitute our base models , as they combine scaled - solar isochrones with a empirical stellar spectral library ( miles ) , which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood . </S>",
    "<S> the models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients , not just on the stellar spectra , but also on extensive photometric libraries , which are used to determine the transformations from the theoretical parameters of the isochrones to observational quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the unprecedent stellar parameter coverage of the miles stellar library allowed us to safely extend our optical ssp seds predictions from intermediate- to very - old age regimes , and the metallicity coverage of the ssps from super - solar to . </S>",
    "<S> ssps with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed ssp seds for a suite of imf shapes and slopes . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a quantitative analysis of the dependence of the synthesized ssp seds on the ( in)complete coverage of the stellar parameter space in the input library that not only shows that our models are of higher quality than other works , but also in which range of ssp parameters our models are reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the ssp seds are a useful tool to perform the stellar populations analysis in a very flexible manner . observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or by using line indices . for the latter </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new line index system ( named lis ) to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular lick / ids system and provide more appropriate , uniform , spectral resolution . </S>",
    "<S> apart from constant resolution as function of wavelength the system is also based on flux - calibrated spectra . </S>",
    "<S> data can be analyzed at three different resolutions : 5 , 8.4  and 14  ( fwhm ) , which are appropriate for studying globular cluster , low and intermediate - mass galaxies , and massive galaxies , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we provide polynomials to transform current lick / ids line index measurements to the new system . </S>",
    "<S> we provide line - index tables in the new system for various popular samples of galactic globular clusters and galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the models to various stellar clusters and galaxies with high - quality spectra , for which independent studies are available , obtaining excellent results . </S>",
    "<S> finally we designed a web page from which not only these models and stellar libraries can be downloaded but which also provides a suite of on - line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra .    </S>",
