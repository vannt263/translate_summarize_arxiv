    "since 1901 and the work of schur @xcite it has been known that the representation theories of the symmetric and general linear groups are intimately related . following later work of schur @xcite and carter and lusztig @xcite , green @xcite showed how this relationship could be explained via passage through the schur algebra using the schur functor .",
    "this algebra has been an object of intense study ever since , and with the rise of quantum groups was generalised by dipper and james @xcite to give the @xmath1-schur algebra .",
    "this plays a corresponding role in relating the representation theories of type @xmath2 hecke algebras and the quantum general linear group .    on the level of cohomology however , there are some striking differences between the symmetric groups and the schur algebras . for example , schur algebras are quasi - hereditary and hence have finite global dimension , while the global dimension of the symmetric group is usually infinite .",
    "thus we must expect some difficulties to arise in the passage of cohomological data from one category to the other .",
    "the majority of this paper is concerned with the @xmath3-groups corresponding to pairs of induced ( or weyl ) modules for the algebraic / quantum group , and to pairs of specht modules for the symmetric group / hecke algebra . in their respective categories",
    "these classes of modules play a key role , and correspond under the action of the schur functor , so we might hope that their cohomology theories are closely related",
    ". we will review what is known , and show how some of the results can be extended and refined .",
    "carter and lusztig @xcite showed that at the level of homomorphisms these two theories could essentially be identified under the standard correspondence .",
    "surprisingly however , consideration of the relationship between the higher @xmath3-groups has been a relatively recent phenomenon .",
    "the first real results in that direction are due to doty , erdmann and nakano @xcite , who used certain spectral sequences arising in the general setting of finite dimensional algebras with idempotent functors .",
    "these gave rise to various relationships between certain @xmath4 and @xmath5 spaces . using this framework , kleshchev and",
    "nakano @xcite and hemmer and nakano @xcite were able to refine these results further , and recently donkin @xcite and parshall and scott @xcite have generalised these results .",
    "donkin , and parshall and scott , show that there are equalities of @xmath3-groups in degrees greater than zero ( for certain classes of modules ) provided that the degree is small compared with the characteristic of the field ( or the degree of the root of unity in the quantum case ) .",
    "this will be our key tool in relating the two categories .",
    "there is an important reduction result due to donkin @xcite ( surprisingly little - known ) , which can be used to reduce to lower rank calculations in certain special cases , and a similar result due to cline , parshall , and scott @xcite where we allow one of the modules to be simple .",
    "unfortunately , relatively little is known about the actual cohomology for explicit modules in either category .",
    "we do have an upper bound on the degree of a non - zero @xmath3 group between two non - zero modules given by [ ryom ] and [ parker ] , but this is the best we can do in general . on the algebraic group side",
    "the only setting where complete information is known is @xmath6 ( and @xmath1-@xmath7 ) , where the second author @xcite has recently determined all @xmath3-groups between weyl modules .",
    "this extends work of erdmann and the first author @xcite where the groups up to degree @xmath8 where determined . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the authors have determined all homomorphisms between weyl modules in characteristic at least @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "( this has recently been generalised to @xmath1-@xmath11 in @xcite . )",
    "apart from these low - rank calculations , the other main general results are either for weights which are close together ( for example in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) or for weights which differ by a single reflection . in the latter case there is a theorem of carter and payne @xcite which has recently been generalised by fayers and martin @xcite .",
    "this generalisation gives a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of a homomorphism which can be difficult to verify in particular examples , and we will show how these conditions may be simplified .",
    "other results in this area consider extensions between simple modules .",
    "kleschev and sheth @xcite consider @xmath4 between simple modules for the symmetric group .",
    "they show in some cases that an extension between two simple modules @xmath12 and @xmath13 must appear in the specht module @xmath14 when @xmath15 and @xmath16 have at most @xmath17 parts and @xmath18 . we will give a generalisation of this result .",
    "wherever possible we have stated results using partition combinatorics rather than alcove geometry and the affine weyl group , in order to simplify the exposition .",
    "however , we believe that the alcove - geometric approach has been under - utilised in the hecke algebra setting and provides a natural context for many results in this area ( see for example section [ homsec ] and the references therein ) .",
    "let @xmath19 be an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath20 and @xmath21 a root of unity .",
    "we define @xmath22 to be @xmath23 if @xmath24 , or the smallest non - zero exponent for which @xmath25 if @xmath26 .",
    "we are interested in the relationship betwen the representation theories of two objects : @xmath27-@xmath28 , the quantum general linear group as defined by dipper and donkin @xcite , and @xmath29 , the hecke algebra of type @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath24 then @xmath30 is the classical general linear group @xmath28 , the group of @xmath31 by @xmath31 invertible matrices over @xmath19 , and @xmath32 is the group algebra of the symmetric group @xmath33 . in this case",
    "we will further assume that @xmath34 .",
    "for the rest of this section we will review the basic results which we require .",

    ".    our main tool for relating the two module categories will be the @xmath1-schur algebra @xmath35 , as defined in @xcite ( generalising the classical definition of green @xcite )",
    ". this will often be abbreviated to @xmath36 when the context is clear .",
    "the module category of @xmath35 can be identified with the category of polynomial modules for @xmath30 of degree @xmath37 . if @xmath38 there exists a certain idempotent @xmath39 . this give rise to the schur functor @xmath40 defined on modules by @xmath41 , together with a partial inverse @xmath42 given by @xmath43 . as @xmath44",
