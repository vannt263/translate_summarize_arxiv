    "solar wind is a stream of charged particles , mostly protons and electrons , that are ejected from the upper atmosphere of the sun .",
    "@xcite , who first coined the term ` solar wind ' , showed that the solar wind is in fact the outer coronal atmosphere escaping supersonically into the interstellar space .",
    "the solar wind is primarily divided into two components , a fast wind with velocities @xmath5900 km / s and a slow wind with velocities @xmath5300 km / s .",
    "these two components differ in their origin and characteristics which include flow speed , proton density , temperature , and helium content @xcite .",
    "the fast solar wind originates from coronal holes , where the magnetic field lines are open , while slow wind is associated with open magnetic field and is highly structured and highly variable @xcite .",
    "observations of solar wind velocity distributions made by different spacecrafts have been analyzed in considerable detail .",
    "helios spacecraft probed the heliosphere as close as @xmath6 au from the sun and these observations have been analyzed using linear and nonlinear time series analysis tools @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the inner heliosphere is a low dimensional chaotic attractor .",
    "@xcite studied a single time series using moving average , singular - value decomposition and surrogate data analysis to characterize the nonlinear behavior of the data . @xcite",
    "have shown that the kolmogorov entropy is positive and finite , as it holds for a chaotic system .",
    "@xcite extended the study by using a nonlinear filter to obtain the noise - reduced data and more reliable estimate of largest lyapunov exponent and kolmogorov entropy .",
    "@xcite analyzed several helios time series to understand the local dynamics of fluctuations in the slow solar wind velocity .",
    "they suggest the inherent changes in the dynamics over the solar cycle using the variance in largest lyapunov exponent for each time series .",
    "+    [ tab ]    in this work , we study how the dynamical system governing the slow solar wind velocity behaves at different phases of the solar activity cycle .",

    "we describe the rank order statistics of symbolic sequence technique . in section [ resu ]",
    "we apply symbolic analysis technique to time series obtained from known nonlinear dynamical systems like lorenz , rssler , and chua oscillators and extend the analysis to solar wind data . in the last section",
    "we give conclusions of our study .",
    "we analyze time series data of radial velocity ( @xmath7 ) measured by the helios spacecraft at @xmath1 au in the years @xmath8 to @xmath9 , corresponding to parts of the solar activity cycles @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( june , @xmath10 to september , @xmath11 ) .",
    "this data is obtained from http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/impact/data_ + browser_helios.html .",
    "although several more time series were available , only those were selected that satisfied the condition of sufficient ( @xmath12 ) data points .",
    "thus , @xmath0 time series were extracted from the helios database with the sampling time for each time series being @xmath13s .",
    "the details of the time series used in the analysis are given in table 1 .",
    "in addition , table 1 ( last column ) contains the corresponding sunspot numbers for each time series obtained from http://sidc.oma.be / sunspot - data/. + in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , we have shown a solar wind time series of @xmath14 data points recorded in the year @xmath9 .",
    "the sequence shows a general decreasing trend .",
    "therefore , before a detailed analysis is carried out , linear and quadratic trends ( @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being a fraction of the total sample ) were subtracted from the raw data @xcite . for the data shown in fig.[fig1]a , parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19",

    "this filter averages in the embedding space of a chosen dimension @xmath23 and a defined neighborhood of size @xmath24 , about @xmath25-@xmath26 times of the estimated initial noise level @xcite .",
    "+        let @xmath27 be the detrended signal .",
    "we construct vectors @xmath28 in this @xmath23 embedding space .",
    "we then replace the data point @xmath29 by its mean value in the neighborhood of size @xmath24 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 denote the clean value and @xmath32 is the number of neighbors within @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "this process is now iterated taking decreasing @xmath24 until no neighbors are found .",
    "we performed two iterations taking the parameters : @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the noise ( that is , the difference between the detrended data in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b and the filtered data in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) is shown in fig .",
    "time series that originate from dynamical systems having complex nonlinear interactions may look very much like noise @xcite . dynamical system behind such intrinsically noisy dataset can be simplified by mapping it to the binary sequences , where the increase and decrease of fluctuations are denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "+ let @xmath38 be the time series data .",
    "a part ( @xmath39 data points ) of the time series ( here @xmath40 component of lorenz oscillator @xcite ) is shown in fig .",

    "these two states are mapped to the symbols @xmath37 and @xmath36 , respectively : @xmath41 we take @xmath42 .",
    "this binary sequence represents a unique pattern of fluctuations in a given time series .",
    "[ fig2]b shows sequence of binary digits for the part of the data shown in fig .",
    "the resulting symbolic series is then partitioned into short sequences of given length l. every short sequence is then uniquely identified by a unique word ( integer ) , @xmath43 we find the probabilities of different words ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) in the complete time series , and then sort them according to decreasing frequency . the resulting rank - frequency distribution , therefore , represents the statistical hierarchy of symbolic words of the time series .",
    "we compare the rank number of each @xmath44 bit word for two different time series . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the rank number of two time series against each other .",
    "[ fig3]a shows the rank order comparison for time series of @xmath40 component of chaotic solution of lorenz oscillator at two different time regimes . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b rank order comparison for time series of @xmath40 component of lorenz oscillator and time series of @xmath40 component of rssler oscillator in the chaotic regime is shown .",
    "if the two time series are similar ( from same dynamical system ) , their rank order points will be located near the diagonal line ( fig . [ fig3]a ) . if the two time series are from different dynamical systems , their rank points will be more scattered ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "we define a parameter weighted distance for @xmath44 bit sequence ( @xmath45 ) between the two time series as :    @xmath46                 +   +                here x and y are two time series , @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent the probability and the rank of a specific word ( @xmath49 ) in the time series respectively . value of @xmath45 lies between @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "greater distance indicates less similarity between the two time series and vice - versa .",
    "the distance between same two time series is zero .",
    "we take three systems ( lorenz , rssler , and chua ) exhibiting chaotic motions . lorenz system is give by @xcite : @xmath50 we choose parameters @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . + rssler system is given by @xcite : @xmath53 parameters are fixed at @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "+ chua system is given by @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined as , @xmath58 .",
    "we take @xmath59 , @xmath60 and select the parameter @xmath61 such that the motion will be a single - scroll type .",
    "+ we take two time series from each system at different time intervals .",
    "hence we have @xmath62 time series in all .",
    "they are denoted as @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the lorenz oscillator , @xmath65 , @xmath66 for the rssler oscillator , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the chua oscillator .",
    "we use rank order statistics on these time series data by keeping @xmath69 .",
    "[ fig4]a shows distances ( @xmath70 for different combinations of these time series of length @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4]a that time series from the same system have less distance as compared to time series from different systems .",
    "[ fig4]a also indicates that @xmath71 data points are sufficient for this analysis .",
    "similar results are obtained when we add noise to the original time series .",
    "[ fig4]b shows the result when we add @xmath74% , @xmath75% , and @xmath3% noise to the original time series of @xmath71 data points .",
    "therefore , we can say that this rank order statistics is quite robust against the presence of high level external noise .      solar wind data have positive largest lyapunov exponent @xcite , positive kolmogorov entropy @xcite , and fractal dimension @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that wind dynamics are driven by the complex nonlinear interactions .",
    "we use rank order statistics with @xmath69 and time series of @xmath76 data points for the analysis .",

    "[ fig6 ] shows the inter - time series distance of solar wind velocity as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) .",
    "behavior of inter - time series distance remains same for all the time series , but the distance is maximum with time series @xmath77 ( for time series @xmath83 ) and with time series @xmath78 ( for time series @xmath84 ) , i.e. , only two time series @xmath77 and @xmath78 show least correlation with rest of the time series .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the most distant time series from a particular time series .",
    "positions of these time series are around the maximum of the solar activity cycle but towards the increasing phase only .",
    "time series @xmath79 is also near the solar maximum but it is in the decreasing phase .",
    "this could be a reason for its less distance to the other time series as compared to the time series @xmath78 .",
    "we used rank order statistics to analyze the time series obtained from known nonlinear systems .",
    "this method is an effective tool for analyzing short time series even in the presence of high level of external noise and is applied to @xmath0 solar wind time series obtained by the helios spacecraft for the years @xmath2 .",
    "nonlinear filter is used to reduce the noise present in the data .",
    "we found that all the time series have least correlation with data sets @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which are located near the maximum of the solar cycle .",
    "although data set @xmath79 is also located very close to the data set @xmath78 ( on the solar activity cycle ) , it shows significant correlation .",
    "one possible reason for this may be that data set @xmath79 is located in the decreasing phase of the solar activity cycle , while data sets @xmath77 and @xmath78 are located in the increasing phase of the solar activity cycle .",
    "this suggests the presence of larger fluctuations in the solar wind velocity data corresponding to the time just before the maximum of the activity cycle .",
