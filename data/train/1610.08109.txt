    "here we are taking advantage of the geometric description of the elliptic divisibility sequence .",
    "thus it is sufficient to show theorem  [ thm:1 ] for non - degenerate linear recurrence sequences of order  @xmath57 . by rescaling once again ( which will not affect the non - degeneracy )",

    "now that we have fixed some notation , we return to  , put the dominant terms on the left - hand side , the expression inside  @xmath134 on the right - hand side , and divide both sides by  @xmath135 obtaining ( in our notation ) @xmath136 where  @xmath137 and @xmath138 for  @xmath126 , with @xmath139 for all  @xmath140 .",

    ", for some positive integer  @xmath148 we have @xmath149 this leads to @xmath150 since  @xmath151 is equal to  @xmath152 , this gives @xmath153 so  @xmath154 and  @xmath155 for  @xmath156 and for all  @xmath157 since  @xmath158 are multiplicatively independent , and hence  @xmath159 for all  @xmath157 .",
    "it follows that  @xmath160 .",
    "in particular , we deduce that  @xmath161 is not a root of unity for large  @xmath157 if  @xmath162 .",
    "the method of proof consists now in completing the following three steps :    * for each  @xmath163 there is some  @xmath164 ,  @xmath165 , such that  @xmath166 .",

    "* the final contradiction .",
    "let us look at the left - hand side of  .",
    "assume first that it is not identically zero as a function of  @xmath157 .",
    "then the expression on the right - hand side of   is not identically zero either , so  @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , the vector @xmath171 satisfies @xmath172 for some appropriate positive constant  @xmath173 , where  @xmath174 denotes the nave height .",
    "indeed , this follows because @xmath175 for  @xmath87 , where  @xmath176 as given by   is non - zero because  @xmath177 is non - zero by lemma [ lemma : leadcoefficientanddegree ] . since from now on  @xmath111 is the only variable",
    ", we omit the dependence on  @xmath178 when we refer to the polynomials  @xmath179 .",
    "indeed , if the degree of  @xmath177 is  @xmath180 , then the degree of  @xmath179 is  @xmath181 , otherwise  @xmath177 is a non - zero constant  @xmath182 , and @xmath93 is the non - zero constant  @xmath182 . if  @xmath183 , then  @xmath184 is the only term in the left - hand side of  , so   is impossible .",
    "thus ,  @xmath185 , so one of  @xmath186 and  @xmath187 is not in  @xmath188 .",
    "thus , one of  @xmath189 or  @xmath190 is not a root of unity , which implies the inequality   by considering just the first two coordinates of  @xmath191 , namely  @xmath192 or  @xmath193 .",
    "we assume that  @xmath157 is large , in particular that it is outside the finite set of zeros of all the non - zero polynomials  @xmath194 .",
    "it is then an immediate consequence of schmidt s subspace theorem  @xcite that the solutions  @xmath195 of the form   to the inequality @xmath196 which is implied by   via  , live in finitely many subspaces of  @xmath197 .",
    "that is , there exist finitely many non - zero vectors  @xmath198 with the property that on writing  @xmath199 we must have that there exists some  @xmath200 such that @xmath201 all this was in the case when the left - hand side of   is non - zero .",
    "if it is zero , we get the equation   at once , with  @xmath202 for  @xmath126 .",
    "so it remains to look at equations of the form  .",
    "for each  @xmath157 satisfying   the left - hand side can be non - degenerate or degenerate . here ,",
    "non - degenerate means that the sum over any proper subset of  @xmath203 on the left - hand side of   does not sum to zero . in any case",
    "an equation of the form   may be thought of as a sum with a bounded number of terms of sums over disjoint subsets of  @xmath203 each of which comprises a non - degenerate equation .",
    "that is , if   is degenerate , then we may write @xmath204 where the right - hand side is a partition into  @xmath205 non - empty subsets  @xmath206 of the set on the left , and such that @xmath207 for  @xmath208 , where each such equation is non - degenerate , meaning that no proper subsum on the left is zero .",
    "so we may assume without loss of generality that equation   is non - degenerate .",
    "as in the proof of the finiteness of the number of non - degenerate solutions to  @xmath209-unit equation ( see schlickewei  @xcite for example ; technically ,   is not an  @xmath210-unit equation since in addition to the elements  @xmath211 which belong to the multiplicative subgroup of  @xmath212 generated by  @xmath213 , the elements  @xmath214 also involve the polynomials  @xmath215 in  @xmath157 , but their heights are of size  @xmath216 , an amount which is negligible , so the argument goes through ) , we are lead to the conclusion that for each @xmath200 there exist  @xmath217 and a finite set of complex numbers  @xmath218 such that for each such  @xmath157 , there is some  @xmath200 with @xmath219 we omit the dependence on  @xmath220 for the rest of this argument hence , @xmath221 we thus get that @xmath222 if  @xmath223 then , by previous arguments , for large  @xmath157 the number on the left - hand side of   above is not a root of unity so its height is at least  @xmath224 for some positive constant  @xmath225 , while the height of the number on the right - hand side of   is  @xmath226 .",
    "thus ,   can not hold for large  @xmath157 unless  @xmath227 .",
    "this almost proves step  ( a ) . to complete the argument ,",
    "fix some  @xmath228 and apply the argument above to derive an equation like  .",
    "if it is non - degenerate and involves  @xmath229 ( so   holds for infinitely many  @xmath157 with some  @xmath220 such that  @xmath230 ) , we are done .",
    "if not , we pick some  @xmath231 such that  @xmath232 , express  @xmath233 linearly from   as @xmath234 and insert this into the left - hand side of  .",
    "again we get a linear form in the variables  @xmath235 ( that is , in a smaller number of variables ) which involves  @xmath236 and which is `` smaller '' to which we may apply the same argument . eventually , after finitely many steps , we get to an equation like   involving our chosen  @xmath229 and some other indices with infinitely many non - degenerate solutions in  @xmath157 , showing that  @xmath227 for some  @xmath237 , which proves step  ( a ) .",
    "step  ( b ) is immediate .",
    "indeed , we have  @xmath238 for  @xmath129 and  @xmath239 for  @xmath240 in  @xmath241 so  @xmath242 is impossible with distinct indices  @xmath243 both in  @xmath241 .    for step  ( c ) , for each  @xmath167 ,",
    "let  @xmath244 be such that  @xmath245 .",
    "matching leading coefficients in  @xmath246 ( as polynomials in  @xmath94 ) and dividing across by  @xmath247 , we get @xmath248 here ,  @xmath249 is the leading coefficient of  @xmath124 . as noted above ,  @xmath250 and @xmath251",
    "so  @xmath252 is in the interior of the convex hull of the set  @xmath253 if  @xmath133 has only two elements , one of which is  @xmath254 itself , we deduce , from  @xmath255 , that  @xmath256 , which is impossible since  @xmath68 is not a root of unity .",
    "thus , either  @xmath133 does not contain  @xmath254 , or it does contain  @xmath254 and has at least  @xmath257 elements .",
    "so ,   each  @xmath252 is in the convex hull of the remaining ones ( and all these numbers are in the interval  @xmath258 $ ] ) .",
    "picking  @xmath254 to correspond to the smallest  @xmath252 , we get a contradiction .",
    "a different way of seeing this last step is to think of  @xmath259 as a solution  @xmath260 to the linear system of equations  @xmath261 , where  @xmath262 is the  @xmath263 matrix with entry  @xmath264 in position  @xmath265 if  @xmath167 and  @xmath127 , and  @xmath266 otherwise .",
    "then  @xmath262 is a matrix whose entries are non - negative , has row sums equal to  @xmath267 and each row contains at least two non - zero entries .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue  @xmath267 of such a matrix is one dimensional , and is spanned by  @xmath268 .",
    "hence ,  @xmath269 for  @xmath129 , which is a contradiction .",
    "this finishes the proof of step  ( c ) and the first proof of the main theorem .",
    "in this section we give a different proof of a slightly stronger statement than theorem  [ thm:1 ] , by reducing both the elliptic and the linear recurrence sequence modulo carefully chosen primes , and finding incompatible behaviours .",
    "two remarks are in order here .",
    "first , we will need to call on results elsewhere that guarantee a sufficient supply of primes with the required properties .",
    "second , the arithmetic argument here is one approach and there may be others .",
    "[ thm:2 ] let  @xmath37 be an elliptic curve defined over the rationals , let  @xmath38 be a point of infinite order , let  @xmath3 be an integer sequence satisfying  @xmath4 , and let  @xmath7 be a linear recurrence sequence .",
    "then there is an infinite set of primes  @xmath51 with the property that a period of  @xmath6 modulo  @xmath51 can not be a period of  @xmath3 modulo  @xmath51 . in particular , no linear recurrence sequence  @xmath7 has the property that  @xmath270    this approach permits some arithmetic perturbation of the sequences without affecting the conclusion .",
    "specifically , if  @xmath3 is replaced by any sequence  @xmath271 where the set of primes dividing any term of  @xmath272 is finite , then the same conclusion holds .",
    "this allows us , in particular , to assume that the sign of @xmath39 is arbitrarily chosen .",
    "this means once again that the proof gives the same result for elliptic divisibility sequences defined in terms of the bi - linear recurrences   and  .      for a prime  @xmath51 ,",
    "let  @xmath273 be the set of solutions modulo  @xmath51 of the equation   reduced modulo  @xmath51 , together with the point at infinity  @xmath134 .",
    "write , in the usual notation , @xmath274 for the number of  @xmath275-points on  @xmath0 . then  @xmath276 by hasse s theorem , and if  @xmath277 , then  @xmath273 forms a group with the group law inherited from the mordell  weil group law on  @xmath0 reduced modulo  @xmath51 .",
    "when  @xmath51 divides  @xmath278 , we have  @xmath279 ( we refer to silverman  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) for standard results on  @xmath280 ) .",
    "if  @xmath281 , then  @xmath1 can be thought of as a point on  @xmath273 which is not the identity , and from now on we make the assumption that  @xmath16 is a non - torsion point on  @xmath282 and that  @xmath281 .",
    "we also claim that  for our purposes  we may safely assume that  @xmath283 . to see this , notice first that  @xmath284 ( since if  @xmath285 then  @xmath16 is of order  @xmath286 in  @xmath282 ) .",
    "if  @xmath287 , then after replacing  @xmath16 by  @xmath288 ( which is still of infinite order ) we have  @xmath289 .",
    "furthermore , the order of  @xmath288 modulo  @xmath51 either equals the order of  @xmath16 modulo  @xmath51 , or equals half of it ( depending of whether the order of  @xmath16 modulo  @xmath51 is odd or even ) .",
    "thus for any odd prime  @xmath290 the order of  @xmath288 modulo  @xmath51 is a multiple of  @xmath290 if and only if the order of  @xmath16 modulo  @xmath51 is a multiple of  @xmath290 .",
    "hence , for the purpose of deciding whether the order of  @xmath16 modulo  @xmath51 is a multiple of  @xmath290 or not , we may replace , if we wish ,  @xmath16 by  @xmath288 and so assume that  @xmath291 below .    now let  @xmath290 be a fixed large prime .",
    "we will ask what can be said about the set of primes  @xmath51 with the property that the order of  @xmath292 is divisible by  @xmath290 . in order to do this , we will make use of recent work of meleleo and pappalardi ( which may be found in the thesis of meleleo  @xcite ; there is also a video presentation by pappalardi  @xcite of some of the results ; the density statement we need may also be found in a paper of david and wu  @xcite ) . before doing this , we need to recall some group - theoretic properties of  @xmath280 .",

    "serre s open image theorem  @xcite says that there exists a positive integer  @xmath299 depending on  @xmath0 with the property that if  @xmath300 , then this galois group is all of  @xmath298 ( we assume that  @xmath299 is already divisible by all the prime factors of  @xmath278 ) .",
