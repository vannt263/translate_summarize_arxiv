    "the speed needed by a star in the solar neighbourghood to escape the local gravitational field of the milky way  known as the local galactic escape speed  has long been known to be an essential indicator of the amount of mass beyond the galactocentric radius of the sun ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) . given the poor constraints on the shape of the galactic rotation curve beyond that radius ( e.g. binney & dehnen 1997 ; famaey & binney 2005 , herefater fb05 ) , it has become one of the most convincing arguments in favour of a halo of dark matter in our galaxy ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the observed tight correlation between the mass profiles of baryonic matter and dark matter at all radii in spiral galaxies ( e.g. mcgaugh et al . 2007 ; famaey et al .",
    "2007 ) rather lends support to modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) .",
    "this theory postulates that for accelerations below @xmath4 the effective gravitational attraction approaches @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the usual newtonian gravitational field . without resorting to galactic dark matter ,",
    "this simple prescription is amazingly successful at reproducing many aspects of the dynamics of galaxies that were unknown when milgrom ( 1983 ) introduced the theory ( e.g. sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ; tiret & combes 2007 ) .",
    "it is however worth noting that the theory might still welcome ( and might even need ) hot dark matter , which could condense in galaxy clusters and boost the ( modified ) gravitational potential on mpc scale ( sanders 2003 ; angus et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in mond ,",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath7 of an isolated point mass @xmath8 at a distance @xmath9 is of the form : [ eqn : potentielmondien](r ) ~(gma_0)^1/2 ln(r ) .",
    "this implies that the associated rotation curve is asymptotically flat , but in turn it implies that there is no escape from such an isolated point mass . in practice however , no objects are truly isolated in the universe and this has wider and more subtle implications in mond than in newton - einstein gravity , for the very reason that mond breaks the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) . in particular , this letter illustrates how the external field regularizes the above divergent potential , so that it _ is _ possible to escape from non - isolated point masses in mond .",
    "more generally , this breakdown of the sep remarkably allows to derive properties of the gravitational field in which a system is embedded from its internal dynamics ( and not only from tides ) .",
    "for this reason , we are able to compute hereafter the external gravitational field in which the milky way should be embedded in mond in order to account for the measured local galactic escape speed .",
    "the result is in good agreement with the gravitational field that large scale structures are expected to exert on the galaxy ( of the order of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the mond paradigm thus successfully explains the value of the local escape speed without referring to any halo of dark matter .",
    "the local galactic escape speed in the solar neighbourhood can be estimated by using local samples of high velocity stars ( fich & tremaine 1991 ) , but this task was until recently hampered by the very small number of such observed stars and by the fact that they were selected from proper - motion surveys .",
    "now , radial velocity data from the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) , a magnitude - limited survey avoiding kinematical biases ( steinmetz et al . 2006 ) , have been used to constrain the local escape speed ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) . a total of 33 stars ( 16 from the rave survey and 17 from beers et al .",
    "2000 ) with velocities higher than 300  @xmath1 have been selected , and , following the technique of leonard & tremaine ( 1990 ) , the local escape speed has been estimated to lie in the following 90% confidence interval : [ eqn : esc ] 498 km s^-1",
    "< v_esc < 608 km s^-1 , with a median likelihood of 544  @xmath1 .",
    "any unbound star in the sample could have biased the result but yu & tremaine ( 2003 ) have shown that hypervelocity stars ejected from the galactic center are actually very rare ( i.e. 1 every @xmath10 years ) and thus not likely to belong to such a survey .",
    "the local galactic escape speed essentially depends on the profile of the gravitational potential in the outskirts of the milky way .",
    "the latter may of course depend on the precise realization of the mond phenomenology . here",
    "we assume that the gravitational potential @xmath7 of the milky way satisfies the modified poisson equation ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) : [ eqn : poissoneffective ] .[(|-+ * g*_e|/a_0 ) ] 4 g , where @xmath7 is the non - external part of the potential , @xmath11 is the density of the ( baryonic ) matter , @xmath12 is the approximatively constant external field in which the milky way is embedded , and @xmath13 is a function which runs from @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and which can thus never be smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "note however that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : poissoneffective ] ) is only an approximate and effective way to take into account the effect of the external field on local physics , in order to avoid solving the modified poisson equation of bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) with an external source term @xmath19 on the right - hand side .",
    "this type of problem can be solved analytically only in some special configurations .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 everywhere in the system , a full perturbative analytical solution can be found ( milgrom 1986 ; zhao & tian 2006 ) , but this is physically relevant only for the internal potential of low - density dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting more massive galaxies such as the milky way .    in the milky way ,",
    "if @xmath21 ( e.g. near the galactic center ) , @xmath22 , and the whole dynamics is purely newtonian . if @xmath23 ( e.g. at 50  kpc from the galactic center ) , then the dynamics is in the mond regime , but the external field can be neglected , leading to a potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : potentielmondien ] ) up to a constant .",
    "finally , when @xmath24 in the outskirts of the system , @xmath25 tends to its asymptotic value @xmath26 , and the gravitational potential is thus newtonian with a renormalized gravitational constant . then , contrary to the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : potentielmondien ] ) , it is possible to escape from such a potential .",
    "this saturation of the @xmath25-function is the essential piece needed to get a _",
    "finite _ but nevertheless _ boosted _ escape speed ( compared to its newtonian value ) .",
    "this can be understood intuitively as follows . at the phenomenological level ,",
    "the mond force deriving from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : potentielmondien ] ) can equivalently be interpreted in newtonian gravity as providing an universal profile of dark halos .",
    "explicitly , the effective dark mass @xmath27 at radius @xmath9 reads @xmath28 $ ] and thus diverges with @xmath29 .",
    "interpreted in newtonian gravity , mond therefore predicts that any _ isolated _ baryonic mass @xmath8 creates an effective dark halo of infinite mass with density profile of the form @xmath30 .",
    "the external field effect however saturates the @xmath25-function at large distance , thereby leading to a potential which is logarithmic only on a finite range @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the transition radius at which the external field equals the local one : @xmath33 .",
    "the external field thus truncates the effective dark halo at @xmath34 , yielding a finite effective dark mass surrounding the galaxy , which may explain the oberved value of the local escape speed ( eq .  [ eqn : esc ] ) , depending on the actual value of @xmath12 .      to simplify the problem , we consider herafter the spherically symmetric case .",
    "the escape speed @xmath35 at radius @xmath29 is defined in a spherical potential as v_esc^2(r ) = ( ) - ( r ) .",
    "we assume that the spatial variation of the external field is so small compared to the size of the milky way that it is approximately constant over all space , so that @xmath36 is well - defined .",
    "we use the assumptions and values from the best analytic mond model of the milky way ( model iii of fb05 ) .",
    "this means that we assume that all the baryonic mass is confined to @xmath37 , where @xmath38  kpc is the galactocentric radius of the sun , and that the asymptotic circular velocity is @xmath39  @xmath1 .",
    "the total baryonic mass @xmath8 of the milky way is related to the latter by means of the tully - fisher relation @xmath40 .",
    "finally the interpolating @xmath25-function is chosen to be given by @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to providing the best analytic fit to the terminal velocity curve of the milky way ( fb05 ) , this function has been shown to yield excellent fits of rotation curves in external galaxies ( famaey et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we then consider as a toy - model a centripetal external field acting as a constant force directed towards the galactic center , in order to estimate the order of magnitude of the external field needed to produce the observed escape speed .",
    "we thus solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : poissoneffective ] ) for @xmath42 ( we also note @xmath43 ) . using spherical symmetry and hence gauss theorem , this means solving : [ eqn : g ] =",
    ".    then we compute the local escape speed v_esc(r_0 ) = ( 2_r_0^g(r ) dr ) ^1/2 , and find that in order to have a local escape speed in the range allowed by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : esc ] ) , with a median of 544  @xmath1 , the external field must be [ ext1 ] g_e=0.010_-0.008^+0.015 a_0 .",
    "note that , in addition to the intrinsic non - sphericity of the inner milky way itself , the real external field points in a definite direction , meaning that the escape speed contours are in reality non - spherical , depending on the angle between the internal and external force vectors . as a first order test of robustness ,",
    "note that replacing @xmath44 by , e.g. , @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g ] ) only leads to a 20  @xmath1 difference in the computed local escape speed for an external field @xmath46 of order @xmath2 .",
    "the milky way potential ( whose zero is fixed at @xmath47 ) obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g ] ) is plotted on figure 1 .",
    "overplotted are the corresponding mond potential without external field ( asymptoting to eq .",
    "[ eqn : potentielmondien ] ) , and the keplerian potential with renormalized gravitational constant @xmath48 .",
    "the actual potential interpolates smoothly between these two behaviours , the transition occurring when the internal and external acceleration are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "kpc and @xmath49  @xmath1 , and an external field directed towards the galactic center @xmath50 .",
    "the potential is such that @xmath51 , and it asymptotes to @xmath52 with @xmath53  @xmath1 .",
    "long - dashed line : the corresponding mond potential without the external field .",
    "short - dashed line : the keplerian potential with a renormalized gravitational constant to which the mond potential asymptotes.,width=321 ]",
    "in this section we focus on the various known sources that may produce the needed external field ( eq .  [ ext1 ] ) in a mond universe .",
    "one must however keep in mind that when there is more than one attractor the mond gravity is not simply the sum of the contributions .",
    "there are two obvious possible contributions : the andromeda galaxy m31 , and the large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "andromeda ( e.g. evans et al . 2000 ) is located at a distance @xmath54  kpc and has a baryonic mass @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the gravitational force per unit mass exerted by m31 on the milky way is of the order of a_0/100 , with some variations depending on the actual location considered in the milky way .",
    "however , since both galaxies have a roughly similar baryonic mass , the mond gravitational field created by m31 is always smaller than the one created by the milky way in the direction opposite to m31 , meaning that m31 can not be the only source of the approximately constant external field we are looking for .    on the other hand , estimating the total contribution from all the relevant distant sources in the lss combined with",
    "the one of m31 is an extremely arduous task ( the mond gravity not being the sum of the individual contributions ) , and would require a detailed knowledge of the precise geometry and mass content of the mond universe at large .",
    "however , one can estimate that a gravitational field of order @xmath2 is roughly the mond acceleration 30  mpc away from a galaxy cluster with an asymptotic , isotropic , line - of - sight velocity dispersion of 500  @xmath1 ( or 130  mpc away from a cluster with a 1000  @xmath1 dispersion ) .",
    "this means that the virgo and coma clusters could both individually contribute external fields of this magnitude ( milgrom 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , it has been known for twenty years ( lynden - bell et al .",
    "1988 ) that the local group belongs to a 600  @xmath56 outflow w.r.t .",
    "the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this is presumably due to the local gravitational attraction of lss , and mainly from the so - called great attractor region at @xmath57 ) ( see radburn - smith et al .",
    "2006 ) . once again , precisely calculating the value of this gravitational attraction at the location of the milky way in a mond universe is virtually impossible , but one can estimate its order of magnitude from the acceleration endured by the local group during a hubble time in order to attain a peculiar velocity of 600  @xmath1 : h_0 600 km s^-1 a_0/100 , for @xmath58 .",
    "this estimation is independent from the assumption that we are living ( or not ) in a mond universe . in conclusion ,",
    "m31 , the virgo and coma clusters , as well as the lss at large , _ all _ provide comparable gravitational fields that precisely lie in the allowed range ( eq .  [ ext1 ] ) in order to produce the right local galactic escape speed .",
    "using the best analytic mond fit for the terminal velocity curve of the milky way ( model iii of fb05 ) , and considering a toy external field acting as a constant force directed towards the galactic center , we have estimated the external field in which the milky way must be embedded in a mond universe in order to produce the observed local escape speed ( sect .  2 , eq .",
    "[ eqn : esc ] ) .",
    "we found that the needed external field is of the order of @xmath2 ( sect .  3 , eq .",
    "[ ext1 ] ) .",
    "one might question how this result depends on the specific choice for the interpolating function @xmath25 .",
    "as we explained at the end of sect .",
    "3.1 , the escape speed is mostly determined by the value of the transition radius @xmath32 where the internal and external accelerations are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the fact that the needed external field is well below @xmath3 means that the internal field at @xmath32 is in the deep - mond regime @xmath16 for any realistic @xmath25-function .",
    "however the @xmath25-function plays a non - trivial role in determining the stellar mass - to - light ratio needed to fit the terminal velocity curve of the milky way . for instance , using the  standard \" function @xmath59 requires a higher mass - to - light ratio , leading to an asymptotic velocity @xmath60  @xmath1 ( model i of fb05 ) .",
    "we calculate that it typically leads to a 30  @xmath1 increase in the local escape speed for an external field of order @xmath2 .",
    "such a variation is thus small compared to the error bars quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : esc ] ) , and this signals the robustness of our estimate w.r.t . the choice of @xmath25 . on the other hand , our eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g ] ) is only an approximation for a couple of reasons : it neglects the presence of the distant external source(s ) ( and hence the direction of the external field ) , as well as a term proportional to the gradient of @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : poissoneffective ] ) . however , both effects are proportional to @xmath46 , meaning that our result does hold qualitatively as a first order estimate .",
    "we argue that @xmath2 is a value roughly compatible with the gravitational attraction that large scale structures are expected to exert on the milky way ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the local galactic escape speed can be explained within a modified gravity framework  la mond without the need of huge quantities of dark mass on galactic scales . however , it is very plausible that taking into account the matter density from m31 , the virgo and coma clusters as well as all the structures within the great attractor in a mond potential solver ( ciotti , londrillo & nipoti 2006 ) could perhaps lead to a local gravitational field slightly above the range allowed by eq .",
    "( [ ext1 ] ) ( note that an important issue regarding this calculation might be the possibility of a scale - dependence of @xmath3 ; see e.g. the values used in nusser 2002 and skordis et al .",
    "such an increase of the external field would slightly decrease the corresponding galactic escape speed , and might signal the need for small quantities of dark mass ( in baryonic or non - baryonic form ) at large radii from the galactic center ( e.g. in the form of 2  ev neutrinos ; see sanders 2003 ; angus et al .",
    "2007 ) .    as a final note ,",
    "we stress that there are good theoretical reasons to impose the @xmath25-function to lie within the range @xmath61 for all @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a small dimensionless parameter . indeed , if the @xmath25-function asymptotes in the standard way at @xmath64 ( as @xmath65 ) then the energy of the gravitational field surrounding a massive body is infinite , as was already pointed out in bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) .",
    "moreover , the most successful relativistic theory of the mond paradigm to date ( bekenstein 2004 ) , may exhibit dynamical singularities if the free function is chosen in such a way that the mond phenomenology is recovered with an effective @xmath25-function asymptoting to zero at @xmath64 ( bruneton 2007 ) .",
    "these two singularities are manifestly avoided if one instead uses a slight deviation from milgrom s first proposal , namely @xmath66 ( sanders 1986 ; famaey et al .",
    "this @xmath63-term acts precisely as the toy external field that we have used in sect .  3",
    ". comparison with observed rotation curves , and especially from the last observed radius of ngc  3741 ( gentile et al .",
    "2007 ) were used in famaey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to constrain @xmath63 to be lower than @xmath67 .",
    "the present analysis of the local escape speed actually enables to put a stronger bound on this parameter .",
    "if @xmath63 were of the order of @xmath67 , it would saturate the @xmath25-function too early and the predicted escape speed would be significantly lower than the one observed . as a conclusion , the value of the local galactic escape speed constrains @xmath63 to be @xmath68 .",
