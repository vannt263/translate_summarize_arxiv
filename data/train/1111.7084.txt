    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most powerful explosion in the universe .",
    "the origin of prompt emission remains unresolved , owing to the fact that the prompt emission has a large explosion energy showing non - thermal spectrum with rapid time - variabilities .",
    "it is widely accepted that the prompt emission is coming from a highly - relativistic flow , because it can reduce the optical depth of the flow which makes the radiation spectrum non - thermal ( rees & mszros 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , in the internal shock scenario , which is one of the most promising scenarios , the relativistic shells collide with each other after the system becomes optically thin ( e.g. piran 1994 for a review ) .",
    "however , it was pointed out by mszros & rees ( 2000 ) that even such a relativistic flow should have a photosphere inevitably and thermal radiation should be coming from there . since then , there have been many theoretical ( daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ; pe@xmath1er et al .",
    "2006 ; pe@xmath1er 2008 ; pe@xmath1er & ryde 2011 ) and observational ( ghirlanda et al .",

    "nowadays , the internal shock model with a photosphere is frequently discussed ( e.g. toma et al .",
    "2011 ; wu & zhang 2011 ) . in this picture , the radius of the photosphere , @xmath2 , is usually smaller than the radius @xmath3 where internal shocks are happening .    the above scenario is based on the assumption that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet is as large as 100 - 1000 .",
    "but what happens if the bulk lorentz factor is not so high ? theoretically , it is natural to consider such a case , because it is very hard to realize such a clean , highly - relativistic flow .",
    "especially , in case of long grbs , some bursts are at least coming from the death of massive stars where a lot of baryons should be surrounding the central engine ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; proga et al .",
    "2003 ; nagataki et al . 2007 ; nagataki 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "thus we can expect there are a lot of `` failed grbs '' that have dirty , not so highly - relativistic flows in the universe ( e.g. dermer et al .",
    "1999 ; huang et al . 2002 ; paragi et al . 2010 ; xu et al .",
    "recently , bromberg et al .",
    "( 2011a , 2011b ) suggested the existence of a large population of failed grbs if the jets failed to break out of the progenitor stars in collapsar model .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath3 becomes smaller if the bulk lorentz factor of the flow is smaller , while @xmath2 increases with the decreasing of bulk lorentz factor .",
    "thus we can expect that the photosphere will become outside of the internal shock region for some lower lorentz factors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon]a ) .",
    "in such a case , @xmath4-rays from the internal shocks can not escape . instead , softer thermal radiation from the photosphere followed by an afterglow will be seen .",
    "we note that such a situation was considered in case of a `` successful grb '' ( rees & mszros 2005 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2009 ; mizuta et al .",
    "2011 ; nagakura et al . 2011 ; ryde & pe@xmath1er 2009 ; ryde et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) . in the photospheric model",
    ", it is considered that the photospheric emission itself is the origin of the prompt emission : its spectrum is modified to non - thermal due to the heating by relativistic electrons that are produced at the internal shocks inside the photosphere ( beloborodov 2010 ; vurm et al .",
    "thus the photospheric model can explain normal successful grbs .    here ,",
    "in this study , we consider the case of `` failed grbs '' .",
    "we show that the direct emission from the photosphere of a failed - grb will be a uv / soft x - ray burst , followed by an afterglow with a peculiar spectrum at early stage .",

    ", then it would be more likely to come from an ordinary grb afterglow or a beaming - induced orphan afterglow .",
    "in addition , at the early afterglow stage , a rebrightening phase will be present in the case of a beaming - induced orphan grb , while it is not expected for ordinary or failed grbs .",
    "therefore , the afterglows of failed grbs can be distinguished from both ordinary grb afterglows and beaming - induced orphan afterglows through observations at the early stages .",
