    "there has been a lot of excitement in recent times about the holographic principle : namely @xcite the idea that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * holographic principle 1 * : _ the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a boundary of the region , and particularly on a light - like boundary_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    now this is usually developed in the context of string theory and the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , where data for general relativity in the bulk is shown to be fully given by a conformal field theory on a null boundary .",
    "this then leads to limits on the data that is needed to construct the spacetime when one takes the state of the bulk on each slice to be fully described by data not exceeding a bits , where a is the area of the boundary of the slice @xcite .",

    "we show that on a null hypersurface the initial data indeed represents a lower dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "the riemann curvature tensor can be decomposed into its irreducible subtensors in the following way @xcite [ riemann ] r_abcd = g_abcd+e_abcd+c_abcd where we have [ g ] g_abcd = r(g_acg_bd - g_adg_bc ) , [ e ] e_abcd&=&12(g_acs_bd+g_bds_ac - g_ads_bc - g_bcs_ad ) , + s_ab&=&r_ab-14g_abr .",
    "the tensor @xmath7 is the weyl tensor which satisfies the same algebraic symmetries as the riemann tensor , namely [ c1 ] c_abcd = c_[ab][cd]=c_[cd][ab ] , c_[abcd]=0 .",
    "furthermore this tensor is traceless , as any contraction of this tensor vanishes : [ c2 ] c^a_bad=0 the properties ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) imply that the left dual of this tensor is equal to its right dual : [ c3 ] ^*c_abcd12_absmc^sm _  cd = c^*_abcd12_cdsmc_ab^  sm , where @xmath8 is the 4-dimensional volume element . + lanczos @xcite constructed a tensor @xmath9 of type ( 0,3 ) , known as the lanczos tensor , such that the weyl tensor can be uniquely determined by the covariant differentiation of this tensor field .",
    "it has been shown rigorously @xcite that this tensor always exists in 4-dimensions .",
    "the algebraic properties of this tensor can be summarised in the following way .",
    "the tensor is antisymmetric in the first two indices , and furthermore we impose an algebraic gauge choice : [ l1 ] l_abc&=&l_bac , + l_a  c^  c&=&0 .",
    "these conditions are very similar to the antisymmetry conditions of the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "however , even with these algebraic constraints , the tensor @xmath9 has 16 independent components , while the weyl tensor has only 10 .",
    "hence one has to impose 6 differential gauge conditions in the following way : [ l2 ] _",
    "cl_ab^  c=0 with the conditions ( [ l1]-[l2 ] ) , the tensor @xmath9 has exactly 10 independent components and one can construct a tensor of type ( 0,4 ) , with the exact symmetry properties of weyl tensor and equate that to the weyl tensor .",
    "hence we have the result @xcite [ wl ] c_abcd&= & 12 , + where the double dual is defined in the usual way ^*_a l^*_[bc]d=14_absm_cdpq^sl^[mp]q .",
    "the above set of 10 independent equations are known as the _ weyl - lanczos _ equations .",
    "we note that just like the electromagnetic potentials , the lanczos tensor also has a gauge invariance .",
    "any algebraic gauge transformation of the form [ gauge ] l_abcl_abc+_ag_bc-_bg_ac , where @xmath10 is an arbitrary four vector , will leave the weyl - lanczos equations unchanged .",
    "+ we can now introduce the einstein and schouten tensors in the usual way : [ ein ] g_ab = r_ab-12g_abr , [ schouten ] j_[ab]c=_[br_a]c-16g_c[a_b]r . using the above two tensors the bianchi identities [ bian ] _",
    "er_abcd+_dr_abec+_cr_abde=0 , can be reduced to the following divergence equations : [ eindiv ] _",
    "b=0 , and [ weyldiv ] _",
    "dc_abc^  d = j_abc .",
    "using equation ( [ wl ] ) in ( [ weyldiv ] ) , we get using the ricci identities and considerable simplifications , the following wave equation for the lanczos tensor [ lwave1 ] l_abc+2r_c^  dl_abd - r_a^  dl_bcd - r_b^  dl_cad & & + -g_acr^edl_ebd+g_bcr^edl_ead-12rl_abc&=&j_abc . for vacuum spacetimes , when the ricci tensor and ricci scalar vanish identically , we can easily see that each of the 10 independent components of the lanczos tensor satisfy a massless scalar field equation [ lwave2 ] l_abc=0 .",
    "hence the components of the lanczos tensor can be treated on the same footing as the potentials in the electromagnetic theory in vacuum , and henceforth we will denote these components as the lanczos potentials .",
    "we will use the newman - penrose formalism @xcite to investigate the field equations in petroc type d geometries .",
    "we assume that the spacetime is spanned by the newman penrose ( np ) null tetrad @xmath11 .",
    "the metric in terms of these tetrads is given by g_ab=-2l_(an_b)+2m_(a_b ) we can define the directional derivative along each of the tetrad vector fields in the following way : dl^a_a , n^a_a , m^a_a , ^a_a also the following are the np spin coefficients [ @xcite ] : \\{,,,,,,,,,,,}. we note here that in general the directional derivatives do not commute .",

    "_ 4=c_abcdn^a^bn^c^dc_2424 .",
    "similarly we can decompose the lanczos tensor into 8 complex scalars defined as follows @xcite : l_0=l_abcl^am^bl^c ; l_1=l_abcl^am^b^c , l_2=l_abc^an^bl^c ; l_3=l_abc^an^b^c , l_4=l_abcl^am^bm^c ; l_5=l_abcl^am^bn^c , l_6=l_abc^an^bm^c ; l_7=l_abc^an^bn^c .",
    "we note that these 8 complex scalars are not linearly independent , as we will see from the np version of the _ weyl - lanczos _ equations @xcite given below : [ wlnp1 ] -12_0&=&dl_4-l_0+(-3-)l_4 + & & + ( + 3-)l_0 + 3l_5 - 3l_1 [ wlnp2 ] -12_1&=&dl_5-l_1+(--)l_5-l_4+l_0 + & & + ( + -)l_1 + 2l_6 - 2l_2 [ wlnp3 ] -12_1&= & l_4-l_0+(-3-)l_4 + & & + ( -+3+)l_0 + 3l_5 - 3l_1 [ wlnp4 ] -12_2&=&dl_6-l_2+(+-)l_6 - 2l_5 + & & + ( --)l_2+l_3-l_3 + 2l_1 [ wlnp5 ] -12_2&= & l_5-l_1+(--)l_5-l_4+l_0 + & & + ( -++)l_1 + 2l_6 - 2l_2 [ wlnp6 ] -12_3&=&dl_7-l_3+(+3-)l_7 + & & + ( -3-)l_3 - 3l_6 + 2l_2 [ wlnp7 ] -12_3&= & l_6-l_2+(+-)l_6 - 2l_5 +",

    "the dalembertian is defined as @xcite 2_a(-l^(an^b)+m^(a^b))_b therefore the scalar wave equations for all the lanczos potentials @xmath12 for a vacuum spacetime can be written as [ wave2 ] \\{l_n}&=&0 for @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we develop the initial data required for a unique solution to the wave equation ( [ wave2 ] ) for the lanczos potentials in a vacuum petrov type d spacetime that posseses a non - trivial killing tensor .",
    "once the potentials are known , then we can use equations ( [ wlnp1]-[wlnp8 ] ) to derive the 5 complex weyl scalars .",
    "since for the vacuum spacetimes , the weyl tensor completely determines the dynamics of gravity , hence the solution of ( [ wave2 ] ) for all the linearly independent lanczos potentials will uniquely determine the 4 dimensional geometry of the spacetime . in particular this will be true on any null surface .",
    "since the hypersurface orthogonal to real null vectors @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) contains @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) as @xmath16 therefore the projection tensor onto a locally orthogonal space now has to be defined differently .",
    "let us now define the projection tensor @xmath17 , which projects tensors and vectors into the 2-d screen space orthogonal to @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) as _",
    "abg_ab+2l_(an_b ) , ^a_a=2,_ac^c_b=_ab , [ ht ] _ abl^b=_abn^b=0 .",
    "therefore we can write _",
    "ab=2m_(a_b ) this is the intrinsic metric on a null hypersurface and this tensor projects all the vectors and tensors onto the 2d plane spanned by @xmath18 .      consider two null 3-surfaces @xmath19 , @xmath20 spanned by @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , intersecting in a spacelike 2-surface @xmath23 spanned by @xmath24 ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "this is the standard geometry for considering the null initial value problem @xcite , as it fits well with the formalism just discussed .",
    "however we would also like to be able to set the null data on a past or future null cone , so as to connect to the way the holographic principle is sometimes stated in relation to observations .",
    "the null cone however represents a problem , because the tetrads become singular at the origin .",
    "+ the way to handle this is shown in figure 2 : add to the null cone @xmath19 with vertex point @xmath27 , here chosen as past directed , a small future directed null cone @xmath20 .",
    "then data on @xmath28 determines the geometry of the 4-dimensional spacetime on the full past @xmath26 of the vertex point @xmath27 of null cone @xmath19 by determining the 4-dimensional space time from the initial data on @xmath28 ( integrating to the past in the past of @xmath20 and to the future in the future of @xmath20 ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , we consider vacuum petrov type d spacetimes that admit a non- trivial killing tensor @xmath5 which solves the equation _ ( ak_bc)=0 . the kerr spacetime , and hence as a special case the schwarzschild spacetime , falls in this category .",
    "this is important as this includes all the astrophysical black hole spacetimes .",
    "both kerr and schwarzschild spacetimes are axisymmetric which imply that their exist a spacelike killing vector in the @xmath18 subspace . furthermore both metrics , being stationary , admit a timelike killing vector in the @xmath29 subspace too . in the case of the zero rotation",
    ", this directly relates to the birkhoff s theorem for vacuum lrs - ii spacetimes , namely that these spacetimes have an extra timelike killing vector in the @xmath29 subspace @xcite .",
    "then we can immediately see that the non - zero spin coefficients , weyl scalars and lanczos potentials are not a function of the curve parameters along the integral curves of these killing vectors",
    ". also being petrov type d , by the corollary of goldberg - sachs theorem @xcite , there exist a pair of principal null congruences in these spacetimes that are geodesic and shear free . hence in these spacetimes the following holds [ d1 ] _ 0=_1=_3=_4=0====0 . in these class of spacetimes",
    "it is natural to choose one of the real null vector of np tetrad ( @xmath30 say ) , as the tangent to one of the principal congruence .",
    "as these are geodesics , we can always make them affinely parametrised : [ d2 ] dl^a=0(+)=0 .",
    "furthermore , if we make the chosen tetrad to be parallely propagated along these congruences , then we have [ d3 ] = = 0 choice of such tetrad is very convenient for many calculations .",
    "now once we have fixed the vector @xmath30 , there is an unique and canonical way to choose the other real null direction @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the second null direction is defined geometrically as the unique other null direction in which the covariant derivative of the shear - free geodetic null vector field is proportional to the shear - free geodetic field itself .",
    "this implies [ d3 ] = 0l^a= ( + ) l^a choice of these two vectors ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) makes the lie derivative of one with respect to the other , to be parallel to the shear - free geodetic null vector : [ d4 ] ^a= ( + ) l^a we can always choose the coordinate in @xmath30 direction , as the affine parameter of the null congruence , ( @xmath32 say ) .",
    "then the solution of the ricci identity [ d5 ] d=^2 is given by = - , where @xmath33 is the constant of the integration along the congruence and the origin of the coordinate @xmath32 is fixed by the requirement that @xmath33 is real . without loss of generality we can always take it to be zero .",
    "this implies the spin coefficient @xmath34 is a real function and hence [ d6 ] -=0 . using equations ( [ d1]-[d6 ] )",
    ", we get the following [ d7 ] _ [ bl_a]=-(+)l_[am_b ] -(+)l_[a_b ] by tetrad rotation we can always make @xmath35 vanish @xcite , and therefore with this choice of tetrad we have @xmath36}=0 $ ] , which imply the vector @xmath30 is equal to a gradient of an complex function @xmath37 : [ d8 ] l_a=_a hence we can easily see that both the null vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 are orthogonal to the 2-surface described by the co - ordinates @xmath38 .",
    "because of the relation ( [ d4 ] ) , the other real coordinate @xmath39 ( along the integral curves of @xmath31 ) can always be constrained as follows @xcite [ d8 ] u=1",
    ". however , there remains a freedom of adding any real function of ( @xmath40 ) to this definition of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore the coordinate system thus defined , @xmath41 , covers the stationary vacuum spacetime and the null vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 are tangent to the surfaces of constant ( @xmath40 ) ) .    due to these symmetry properties of petrov type d spacetimes , we also have a reduced set of lanczos potentials in this case @xcite : l_0=l_4 , l_1=l_5 , l_2=l_6 , l_3=l_7 .",
    "now , due to the extra symmetry of the non - trivial killing tensor in these spacetimes , for the potentials @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , we can always perform a separation of variables @xcite between those of the @xmath44 subspace and those of the @xmath18 subspace in equation ( [ wave2 ] ) .",
    "thus we can write @xmath45      on the 2d screen space of a null - hypersurface , the wave equation for @xmath46 reduces to [ 2dwave ] [ ( + 2)+(+2)]\\{l_n_2(,)}=0 where @xmath20 runs from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "this is a 2 d laplace equation and the solutions of these are harmonic functions . in the case of a kerr geometry , these are the spheroidal harmonics which reduce to spherical harmonics in the case of vanishing rotation . here we state an important theorem for the n - dimensional laplace equation @xcite :    the symmetries of the n - dimensional laplace equation are exactly the conformal symmetries of n - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "therefore any solution of equation ( [ 2dwave ] ) ( for example the spherical or spheroidal harmonics ) are conformally symmetric and these can describe a 2 dimensional conformal euclidean scalar field on the 2d screen space .",
    "+ now from equation ( [ wave2 ] ) , we can easily see that the equation for @xmath49 on the @xmath44 subspace reduces to [ hyperbolic ] l_n_1=0 which is a two dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equation , and the solution on the whole subspace can be uniquely found by specifying the initial data @xmath50 ( or conversely @xmath51 ) .",
    "+ therefore , the complete set of initial data @xmath52 on a null hypersurface @xmath53 , required to solve equation ( [ wave2 ] ) is given as [ initial1 ] ( _ 1)=\\{l_n_1(u_0,v ) l_n_2 ( , ) , l_n_1(u_0,v)l_n_2 ( , ) } + similarly for the null hypersurface @xmath54 , the required initial data will be [ initial1 ] ( _ 2)=\\{l_n_1(u , v_0 ) l_n_2 ( , ) , dl_n_1(u , v_0)l_n_2 ( , ) } +    we can easily see that each element of the above sets , satisfies the two dimensional laplace equation ( [ 2dwave ] ) and hence represent a two dimensional conformal euclidean field .",
    "it is interesting that the conformal euclidean scalar field lies on a two dimensional surface rather than a three dimensional one .",
    "this relates firstly to the fact that the intrinsic metric on any null surface is two dimensional and since we are specifying the initial data on a null surface , that must reside on the 2d screen space ; and secondly to the fact that there are symmetries on the 3-dimensional space ( killing tensors and vectors ) that we have exploited in the above derivation .",
    "in fact , from our knowledge of thermodynamics of a schwarzschild or kerr black holes , this seems quite natural .",
    "if we conjecture a one to one correspondence between the statistical properties of this conformal euclidean field and thermodynamics of gravity , then this clearly shows why the black hole entropy depends on the two dimensional surface area of a null event horizon rather than three dimensional volume .",
    "+ we can now state the _ holographic _ principle for general relativity , in this case :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * general relativity holography*:_on a null hypersurface @xmath0 in a vacuum petrov type d spacetime with a non trivial killing tensor ( which describes all the astrophysical black hole spacetimes ) , the gravitational dynamics of four dimensional general relativity reduces to an euclidean conformal field theory in two dimensions for four scalar variables .",
