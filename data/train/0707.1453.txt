    "small - x qcd evolution , historically based on dglap  @xcite and bfkl  @xcite dynamics , has been widely investigated in the past years  @xcite , leading to a better understanding of the two approaches just mentioned and to robust resummed predictions for the gluon density and splitting function  @xcite .",
    "there is now a remarkable consensus  @xcite among various resummation approaches on the resulting gluon evolution kernel , and a satisfactory comparison of some of them to experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea underlying the progress of the resummation approaches just mentioned , lies in the observation  @xcite that the bfkl kernel embodies an infinite number of subleading contributions which are collinear singular .",
    "these terms are parametrically large and need to be taken into account in order to achieve consistency with the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "the techniques for incorporating such terms differ in detail according to the various authors , but lead eventually to similar results .",
    "however , all approaches developed so far limit themselves to a consistent resummation scheme only for the evolution of the gluon density .",
    "the quark - sea contribution is obtained on the basis of @xmath1-factorization of the @xmath16 dipole  @xcite in the dis factorization scheme and/or by adding the @xmath17 contribution to the next - to - leading-@xmath18 ( nl@xmath3 ) bfkl kernel .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to devise a resummed small-@xmath3 evolution scheme in a coupled matrix form , so as to treat gluons and quarks on the same footing and in a collinear factorization scheme which is as close as possible to a predetermined one , e.g.  the @xmath2 scheme .",
    "our matrix approach , in the collinear limit , has the advantage that it complies automatically with the matrix factorization of the integrated partonic densities in the singlet evolution , and thus is able to incorporate the known low - order anomalous dimensions for any value of @xmath19 , the moment index . on the other hand , in the high - energy limit , the ( gauge - invariant ) unintegrated partonic densities",
    "are well defined by @xmath1-factorization around different values of @xmath20 . to be precise ,",
    "the gluon unintegrated density is defined around @xmath21 and the quark around @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , in the leading high energy region  that is around @xmath21  we are able to include the known ll@xmath3+nl@xmath3 bfkl kernel in the gluon channel _ only _ , thus leaving the quark entries somewhat unconstrained from the @xmath1-factorization standpoint .",
    "note however that assuming a bfkl framework in matrix form is a demanding requirement , because @xmath1-factorization implies resummation formulae for the anomalous dimension matrix up to nl@xmath3 level .",
    "therefore , incorporating both exact low - order anomalous dimensions ( say , in the @xmath2 scheme ) and nl@xmath3 expressions ( from the exact bfkl kernel ) imposes on our matrix kernel some nontrivial consistency relations expressing the requirement that collinear and high - energy schemes do not conflict with each other .",
    "they are discussed in detail in the following , and we find that they are satisfied in the @xmath2 scheme up to nlo level , while they are marginally violated at nnlo , by small terms in the @xmath23 entry of relative order @xmath10 .",
    "for this reason we restrict ourselves , in this paper , to the nlo - nl@xmath3 level .",
    "this means that , starting at nnlo , our splitting functions will be in some matrix scheme which is not the @xmath2 scheme .",
    "higher order effects on the scheme change have been studied in  @xcite and have been found to be comparable to renormalization scale uncertainties .",
    "besides the nlo - nl@xmath3 information mentioned above , we impose the general requirement of consistency with the renormalization group in both ordered and antiordered configurations of exchanged partonic momenta @xmath1 s .",
    "this is best expressed in the @xmath24 symmetry of the kernel , where @xmath25 is conjugated to @xmath26 .",
    "we enforce this symmetry by the so - called consistency constraint  @xcite which introduces an @xmath20-dependence in the ( leading ) kernel , so as to resum those parts  @xcite of the higher order bfkl kernels which are required by the rg .",
    "this procedure follows previous papers  @xcite and is used in particular for the @xmath9 matrix element of the kernel .    despite all such requirements",
    ", there is a considerable ambiguity in our approach which is tied up to the matrix structure , because the @xmath25 and @xmath20 dependences of the various matrix elements of the kernel are constrained only to a limited extent by the collinear and high - energy limits .",
    "we therefore introduce in sec .",
    "[ sec : bmf ] some further requirements , mostly related to the pole structure of the kernel in the @xmath25 and @xmath20 variables , by requiring it to have at most simple poles .",
    "this assumption is quite natural in the case of @xmath27 because of the bfkl limit , and follows by the @xmath20-expansion method  @xcite in the @xmath28 case .",
    "the leading twist pole structure of the kernel at lowest order in @xmath29 is basically @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 denotes the lo dglap anomalous dimension matrix . the full kernel to second order in @xmath29",
    "is constructed in secs .",
    "[ sec : bmf ] and [ sec : knla ] according to the requirements stated above .",
    "it also contains running coupling effects at the scales suggested by the nl@xmath3 bkl kernel and by the rg .    in the frozen @xmath29 case we calculate in sec .",
    "[ s : fcad ] the resulting anomalous dimension matrix , and its eigenvalues @xmath32 .",
    "the leading eigenvalue at high energies , @xmath33 , contains important resummation effects in the @xmath34 variable .",
    "we also obtain resummation formulae for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the latter being specific to our matrix approach and not directly obtained on the basis of the nl@xmath3 bfkl kernel only . in sec .",
    "[ s : cfrgf ] we present results for the effective eigenvalue ( or characteristic ) functions @xmath37 as inverse functions of the anomalous dimensions , and for the hard pomeron exponent @xmath38 . in the case with running coupling described in sec .",
    "[ s : nrrc ] , we provide the resummed dglap splitting function matrix in @xmath3 space , obtained by the numerical deconvolution method proposed in  @xcite and generalized to the matrix case .",
    "details of the matrix kernel and of the anomalous dimension expressions are left to appendices a - c .",
    "the general purpose of this paper is to provide integro - differential matrix equations for unintegrated parton distributions , which interpolate between dglap evolution equations  @xcite in the hard scale variable @xmath39 and the high - energy bfkl evolution equation  @xcite in the rapidity - like variable @xmath40 . despite the high - energy and collinear factorization constraints ,",
    "the above interpolation is subject to considerable ambiguities , due to the following facts :    * off - shell , unintegrated densities are defined in a gauge - invariant way by @xmath1-factorization of gluon and quark exchanges around different values of the moment index @xmath41 , namely @xmath42 for the gluon and @xmath43 for the quark . of the quark exchange , which leads to an energy dependence of the cross - section of type @xmath44 at high energies . for alternative approaches to the definition of unintegrated densities",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "therefore , in the high - energy region  that is around the leading value @xmath42  only some effective gluon equation ( which incorporates the high - energy quark contributions ) is constrained by the bfkl limit , whose kernel has been calculated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "this makes the interpolation of the kernel to generic @xmath20 values more ambiguous for the quark entries . *",
    "the collinear limit constrains the matrix kernel for both quarks and gluons , but in a factorization - scheme dependent way , and only in the strongly ordered region of transverse momenta @xmath45 and in the anti - ordered one .",
    "this limit only restricts the singularities of the kernel in the variable @xmath25 ( conjugated to @xmath39 ) so as to reproduce the low order anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "in addition , the collinear @xmath46 anti - collinear relationship implies the existence of a @xmath24 symmetry , whose form is however quite general , depending again on the factorization - scheme .      in order to tame the ambiguities of the off - shell continuation mentioned above",
    ", we shall use a few basic criteria which  we shall argue  can be consistently imposed and correspond to a factorization - scheme choice for both high - energy and collinear limits .",
    "let us refer to a matrix kernel @xmath47 , acting on @xmath1-space , such that the parton green s function is given by @xmath48^{-1}_{ab}({\\boldsymbol{k}},{\\boldsymbol{k}}_0 ) \\ ; ,    \\quad ( a , b = q , g ) \\;.\\ ] ] in the frozen @xmath29 limit , the kernel matrix elements are diagonalised in @xmath25-space and given by the eigenvalue function @xmath49 .",
    "our first basic assumption is that in the collinear limit @xmath50 and @xmath20 fixed , the matrix kernel @xmath51 shows simple poles only , in the form of a @xmath25-expansion @xmath52 here , the @xmath53 singularity is natural because of the dglap limit , and would be the only term present in a pure evolution equation in @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , it implies ( sec .",
    "[ ss : fklla ] ) that the one - loop anomalous dimension matrix @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 , the coefficient of the @xmath53 pole of lowest order in @xmath29 ( while the higher order terms @xmath56 involve @xmath57 as well ) .",
    "note however that higher powers of @xmath58 could have been present also , anomalous dimension relation @xmath59 could be replaced in the subleading @xmath20-dependence , thus producing higher powers of @xmath58 . ] and do actually occur in the normal formulation of the nl@xmath3 bfkl kernel  @xcite . by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammastruct ] ) we explicitly exclude such possibility in our matrix kernel , while the bfkl kernel will be recovered by proper algebraic manipulations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : knla ] ) .",
    "our second assumption is analogous to  ( [ eq : gammastruct ] ) with @xmath20 and @xmath25 interchanged . in the high - energy limit of @xmath60 with @xmath25",
    "kept fixed we require simple pole singularities in the @xmath20-expansion @xmath61 where , in addition , @xmath62 the @xmath63 singularity is natural because of the bfkl limit and would be the only term present in a pure evolution equation in @xmath40 .",
    "it implies that the eigenvalue function of the ll@xmath3 bfkl kernel is given by @xmath64 , the coefficient of the @xmath63 singularity of lowest order in @xmath29 ( while the nl@xmath3 bfkl kernel , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : knla ] , involves @xmath65 also )",
    ".    therefore , higher order singularities in @xmath20  which are present in the anomalous dimension at higher order  will be obtained ( sec .",
    "[ s : fcad ] ) by using the rough anomalous dimension relation @xmath66 in the subleading @xmath25-dependence .",
    "the fact that only @xmath67 and @xmath68 possess the @xmath63 singularity is related to the fact that in usual factorization schemes  @xcite , only @xmath36 and @xmath69 show a ll@xmath3 dependence on the @xmath34 variable .",
    "there is a third important assumption , which deals with the relationship between collinear and anti - collinear orderings of exchanged transverse momenta .",
    "both orderings are to be incorporated in our off - shell formulation and simple kinematical considerations show that the variable conjugated to @xmath39 in the reverse ordering is @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath25 and @xmath70 must be related by some symmetry , and we shall assume , out of simplicity , @xmath71    it is perhaps useful to recall the formal basis for the symmetry  ( [ eq : symmetry ] )",
    ". let us write the @xmath1-factorization formula for the @xmath72 differential cross - section in the form  @xcite @xmath73 where we have lumped in the @xmath74 superscripts the dependence on the hard scales @xmath75 of the process .",
    "then the change of energy - scale from @xmath76 to , say , @xmath77 can be incorporated by the change of kernel @xmath78}({\\boldsymbol{k}},{\\boldsymbol{k}}';{\\omega } )    = \\left(\\frac{k}{k'}\\right)^{\\omega}{\\mathsf{k}}^{[k k_0]}({\\boldsymbol{k}},{\\boldsymbol{k}}';{\\omega } ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] or , at frozen @xmath29 , by the @xmath20-dependent shift  @xcite of the corresponding eigenvalue functions to denote eigenvalue functions of kernels considered in or related to previous works on small-@xmath3 resummations in the gluon - channel .",

    "the situation is pretty clear for collinearly ordered particles .",

    "[ fig : abcd ] , with @xmath3 decreasing from right to left we have a sequence of splitting functions such as @xmath150 describing @xmath151 going to @xmath152 , @xmath152 to @xmath153 and so on , as predicted from @xmath51 also .",
    "on the other hand , in the anti - collinear limit the dglap splitting functions need to account for the opposite splittings , @xmath152 to @xmath151 , etc . @xmath154",
    "then , one would naively expect that the anti - collinear pole in the kernel be associated with @xmath155 .",
    "this seems to work fine as long as we consider a complete chain of anti - collinear splittings .",
    "problems arise however when trying to join collinear and anti - collinear chains .",
    "firstly there is an issue of colour factors : the anomalous dimension @xmath156 implicitly includes a factor @xmath157 for the number of varieties of parton @xmath158 that can be produced ( @xmath159 if @xmath158 is a gluon , @xmath160 for an ( anti)quark ) . for each exchanged particle in fig .",
    "[ fig : abcd ] that factor should be included exactly once . in the collinear limit",
    "it is included in the branching to the right of a given exchange ( e.g.  for @xmath152 it is included in @xmath161 ) , while in the anti - collinear limit , as written in ( [ eq : naive_anticollinear ] ) , it is included to the left ( in @xmath162 ) . if we are to consider a single evolution from right to left containing both collinear and anti - collinear splittings we should ensure that the @xmath157 factors are consistently included to one side , for example in the branching to the right of the exchange .",
    "one then needs to correct the splitting function @xmath163 for an anti - collinear @xmath164 splitting by a factor @xmath165 .    the second issue that arises relates to high - energy factorization .",
    "for each exchanged gluon we have a factor @xmath63 . in a sequence of collinear branchings that @xmath63 factor",
    "is associated with the splitting function to the right of the gluon exchange ( e.g.  if @xmath152 is a gluon then it is included in @xmath161 ) , while for anti - collinear branchings it comes from the splitting function to the left ( i.e.from @xmath162 ) .",
    "this causes problems if we have an anti - collinear splitting to the left of a gluon exchange and a collinear one to the right , since _ both _ will include a @xmath63 factor for the intermediate exchanged gluon .",

    "therefore in the case of an anti - collinear branching we should multiply @xmath163 by a factor @xmath166 where @xmath167 , so as to ensure that @xmath168 is never associated with a @xmath63 factor , while @xmath158 has it when @xmath158 is a gluon .",
