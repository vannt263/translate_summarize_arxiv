    "in its simple form , a defaultable claim pays a certain pre - defined amount at the maturity of the contract , if there has not been a prior default , and pays zero otherwise . in this work ,",
    "an hedging analysis is carried out for these derivatives when the underlying risky asset is modeled by a finite variation lvy process .",
    "it is of mathematical and practical interest to study the hedging of defaultable claims when the asset prices are affected by jumps .",
    "the extension to more complicated derivatives and underlying processes will be interesting for future work .",
    "first , we review the literature and related previous works .",
    "we start by a definition of credit risk .",
    "credit risk is the risk associated with the possible financial losses of a derivative caused by unexpected changes in the credit quality of the counterparty s issuer to meet its obligations .",
    "the first paper that introduced credit risk for a path independent claim goes back to the work of merton ( 1974 ) .",
    "when analyzing a credit derivative , normally there are two prominent issues , pricing and hedging of the derivative .",
    "the latter is a more challenging question , especially when the market is incomplete . in most financial models ,",
    "even when working with simple stochastic processes , a complete hedge still may not be feasible for credit derivatives .",
    "there are different approaches to manage the risk in an incomplete market .",
    "quadratic hedging is a well developed and applicable method to manage the risk .",
    "schweizer ( 2001 ) or pham ( 1999 ) provide a good survey of quadratic hedging methods in incomplete markets . in schweizer ( 2001 )",
    "two quadratic hedging approaches are discussed for the case where the firm s value process is a semimartingale .",
    "these are local risk - minimization and mean - variance hedging .    if we prefer a self - financing portfolio in order to hedge a contingent claim , we speak of mean - variance hedging .",
    "if we rather select a portfolio with the same terminal value as the contingent claim ( but not necessarily self - financing ) , we are in the context of a ( locally ) risk - minimizing approach .",
    "schweizer , heath and platen ( 2001 ) provide a comprehensive study and comparison of both approaches . in our paper a local risk - minimization approach is used to manage the risk associated with the defaultable claims .",
    "local risk - minimization hedging emerged in the development of the concept of risk minimization .",
    "fllmer and sondermann ( 1986 ) were among the first to deal with this problem .",
    "they solved the problem identifying the risk - minimization strategy when the underlying process is a martingale .",
    "the generalization to the local martingale case is done in schweizer ( 2001 ) .",
    "the solution of the risk - minimization problem is linked to the so called galtchouk - kunita - watanabe ( gkw ) decomposition assuming that the underlying process is a local martingale .    for a non - martingale process , schweizer ( 1988 )",
    "provides an example of an attainable claim that does not admit a risk - minimization strategy .",
    "the extension is possible by putting more restrictive conditions on the underlying process as well as on the hedging strategies .    literally saying , one has to pay more attention to the local properties of the problem .",
    "as for the role of the underlying process , it has to satisfy the structure condition is a square integrable special semimartingale with the canonical decomposition @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath1 satisfies the structure condition , if there exists a predictable process @xmath2 such that @xmath3 for all @xmath4 , and the mean - variance tradeoff process , defined by @xmath5 , is @xmath6-almost surely finite for all @xmath4 . ] ( sc ) , see schweizer ( 1991 ) or schweizer ( 2001 ) . under certain conditions like sc , a locally risk - minimizing strategy is equivalent to a more tractable one , called pseudo - locally risk - minimizing strategy .",
    "fllmer and schweizer ( 1991 ) gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a pseudo - locally risk - minimizing strategy .",
    "it turns out that finding these strategies is equivalent to the existence of a generalized version of the gkw decomposition , known as the fllmer - schweizer ( fs ) decomposition . a sufficient condition for the existence of an fs decomposition",
    "is provided by monat and stricker ( 1995 ) .",
    "although the existence of locally risk - minimizing strategies is proved under some conditions , it completely depends on the fs decomposition . in some special cases",
    "there are constructive ways of finding this decomposition explicitly .",
    "the case of continuous processes is more flexible , and the well known method of minimal equivalent local martingale measure ( melmm ) is applicable .",
    "biagini and cretarola ( 2009 ) study general defaultable markets under a locally risk - minimizing approach",
    ". however the continuity of the underlying process is a crucial assumption in their work .",
    "most recently , choulli , vandaele and vanmaele ( 2010 ) find an explicit form of the fs decomposition based on a representation theorem .",
    "they aimed to provide a general framework under which the fs decomposition is obtained .",
    "while this work could fit into theirs , our approach leads to a more explicit form of the fs decomposition . by using a slightly different method ,",
    "we specifically focus on the hedging of the defaultable claims , based on the theory of local risk - minimization , assuming that the underlying process is a bounded variation lvy process with positive drift .",
    "our paper studies a structural model , in the sense that a default event is defined , and we use the whole market information represented by the filtration generated by the underlying process .",
    "however , while the default event is structural ( and so economically intuitive ) , we use an analysis like that of reduced form models and especially intensity based models .",
    "these models were pioneered by the works of artzner and delbaen ( 1995 ) or jarrow and turnbull ( 1995 ) , and they do not use or determine a default model of the firm .",
    "they use an intensity process or hazard process instead .",
    "martingale techniques and the idea of intensity in reduced form models are applied to analyze the structure of the defaultable claims . in section [ sec : mp ] , under some conditions , a compensation formula is used to find a canonical decomposition of the defaultable process @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a hitting time ( defining the default time ) and @xmath9 is a real valued function .",
    "this enables us to use compensator techniques for these types of processes .",
    "the predictable finite variation part of this decomposition is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "hence , when @xmath10 is a constant function , this precisely determines the intensity of @xmath8 .",
    "this intensity is already obtained by theorem 1.3 of guo and zeng ( 2008 ) for a hunt process that has finitely many jumps on every bounded interval . however , a finite variation lvy process could have infinitely many jumps on bounded intervals and so some modifications of their ideas would be essential .",
    "note that in our analysis the underlying process allows for jumps , the payoff is linked to a structural default event , and the probability measure is not necessarily a martingale measure .",
    "in addition we do not use any type of girsanov s theorem , but the results are based on solutions of partial integro - differential equations ( pide ) .",
    "we also study the structure of the default indicator process @xmath11 and finite horizon ruin time . apart from the theoretical concerns in this paper , the main effort is devoted to obtain answers to two interesting questions .",
    "the first question is , given a defaultable claim , how a locally risk - minimizing hedging strategy can be carried out . as it is not possible to eliminate the credit risk completely ,",
    "the second question is whether it is possible to design a customized defaultable security , to make the product completely hedgeable i.e. , the claim can be written as the sum of a constant and a stochastic integral with respect to the underlying process .",
    "this will result in a risk - free defaultable claim .",
    "in our setup we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a product .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the model , some preliminary assumptions , and results are provided in section [ sec : mp ] . a canonical decomposition of the stochastic process @xmath12",
    "is discussed in section [ sec : drg ] .",
    "this is an essential tool in our analysis .",
    "locally risk - minimizing hedging strategies for defaultable claims are obtained in section [ sec : hsdc ] . in section [ sec :",
    "edtpt ] , we take a look at the structure of the default time .",
    "we study a process @xmath1 , modeling a firm s assets value , constructed on a probability space @xmath13 and we denote by @xmath14 its natural filtration , completed and regularized so that it satisfies the usual conditions .",
    "we study defaultable claims with actual payoffs of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a real valued function , and @xmath18 is the maturity or expiration time of the security , and @xmath19 note that the firm s assets value is assumed to be observable .",
    "therefore from a financial point of view , the definition in for default makes sense if either the modeler is the firm s management , the accounting data are publicly available or they can be well estimated in the market .",
    "the security in pays @xmath20 if there is no default in @xmath21 $ ] and zero otherwise , hence the recovery rate is considered to be zero .",
    "a defaultable zero - coupon bond is a special case of this security by letting @xmath22 , on @xmath23 for a constant @xmath24 .",
