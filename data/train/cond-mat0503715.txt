    "one may distinguish between three types of approximation strategies :    in a _ type - i approximation _",
    "one derives the euler equation @xmath19 / \\delta { { \\boldsymbol x } } = 0 $ ] first and then chooses ( a physically motivated ) simplification of the equation afterwards to render the determination of @xmath11 possible .",
    "this is the most general but worst type , as normally the approximated euler equation no longer derives from some approximate functional",
    ". this may result in thermodynamical inconsistencies .",
    "a _ type - ii approximation _ modifies the form of the functional dependence , @xmath20 \\to \\widetilde{\\omega}_{{{\\boldsymbol t } } , { { \\boldsymbol u}}}[\\cdots]$ ] , to get a simpler one that allows for a solution of the resulting euler equation @xmath21 / \\delta { { \\boldsymbol x } } = 0 $ ] .",
    "this type is more particular but yields a thermodynamical potential consistent with @xmath11 .",
    "generally , however , it is not easy to find a sensible approximation of a functional form .    finally , in a _ type - iii approximation _",
    "one restricts the domain of the functional .",
    "the restriction comes in addition to those conditions that are physically necessary anyway ( e.g.  normalizations ) and requires a precise definition of the domain .",
    "this type is most specific and , from a conceptual point of view , should be preferred as compared to type - i or type - ii approximations as the exact functional form is retained .",
    "in addition to conceptual clarity and thermodynamical consistency , type - iii approximations are truely systematic since improvements can be obtained by an according extension of the domain .",

    "the dmft is obtained for @xmath136 and @xmath137 since a continuous bath ( @xmath137 ) is necessary to represent an arbitrary local free green s function .",
    "the choice @xmath136 but @xmath138 yields new approximations ( `` dynamical impurity approximations '' , dia ) which are inferior as compared to the full dmft but allow for much simpler and faster calculations when @xmath139 is small .",
    "the most simple but non - trivial approximation ( @xmath140-dia ) has been shown @xcite to already cover the essence of the dmft scenario @xcite for the mott metal - insulator transition in the hubbard model . at the critical point for @xmath42",
    "the calculations can be done even analytically @xcite , and with increasing @xmath139 the grand potential , static quantities and the entire phase diagram rapidly converge to the full dmft results @xcite .",
    "the dia is similar but superior as compared to the exact - diagonalization approach @xcite . even for small @xmath139",
    "the approach is thermodynamically consistent and , off half - filling , respects the luttinger sum rule , for example .",
    "the dia has also been employed successfully to study the influence of phonons on metal - insulator transitions in the holstein - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "nothing new is obtained for @xmath137 and @xmath141 : here the sfa recovers the cellular dmft @xcite .",
    "( note that the dynamical cluster approximation @xcite is a type - ii approximation ) .",
    "more interesting is the case @xmath142 and @xmath141 which turns out @xcite to represent a variational generalization of the cluster - perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this v - cpt is well suited to describe phases with spontaneously broken symmetry and has been employed to study one - particle excitations and antiferromagnetic order in the @xmath143 and @xmath144 hubbard model at half - filling @xcite and charge ordering in the extended hubbard model @xcite . a further application concerns antiferromagnetism in quarter - filled ladder systems @xcite",
    ". an impressing example of the power of the v - cpt approach has been given recently in a study of the competition between antiferromagnetism and d - wave superconductivity in the hole- and electron - doped hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the question of phase separation is addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    summing up",
    ", the sfa is able to unify different cluster theories and local approximations within a single and consistent framework which offers a large flexibility in the use of bath sites , ficticious fields , boundary conditions and particle reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the formalism provides a controlled compromise between the demands for a non - perturbative and systematic theory working in the thermodynamic limit on the one hand , and the limited computational capabilities to diagonalize finite - size systems on the other .",
    "the self - energy - functional approach allows to construct a series of consistent approximations which improve systematically as @xmath145 .",
    "it is by no means clear , however , whether bath sites @xmath146 help to speed up the convergence with respect to @xmath135 and whether a cluster extension of dmft or the v - cpt is more efficient .",
    "this can be clarified only empirically by considering different lattice models in different dimensions .",
    "as a few bath sites have turned out to be sufficient for reproducing the essential mean - field ( @xmath136 ) physics in a number of studies of the single - band hubbard model , further applications of the dia are worthwhile to explore e.g.  the mean - field phase diagrams of more complex ( multi - orbital ) models .",
    "furthermore , one may also envisage the application of a simplified dmft where a single ( but continuous , @xmath137 ) bath is optimized for a multi - orbital model",
    ". this might be well justified for not too low temperatures .    on the technical side",
    ", there are two main future tasks : the full diagonalization and the lanczos method which have been used so far , should be supplemented by a `` reference system solver '' based on stochastic techniques to improve the scaling of the numerical effort with the system size .",
    "secondly , it would be advantageous to have an iterative technique at hand that directly yields a solution of the sfa euler equation without the need for numerical differentiation .",
    "first results using full diagonalization @xcite are encouraging .    on the conceptual side ,",
    "the question for the possibility to give strict upper bounds to the grand potential is still open .",
    "probably , a positive answer requires to establish a link to the ritz variational principle . on the other hand ,",
    "no example is known yet where the sfa grand potential at a stationary point is _ lower _ than the exact one .",
    "there are different directions into which the formalism may be extended . as the coherent - potential approximation for the disorder anderson model has the same ( mean - field ) status as the dmft for the hubbard model , it suggests itself that a self - energy - functional approach can also be constructed for systems with disorder ( and interaction ) .",
    "first applications @xcite demonstrate that such a theory @xcite is feasible .",
    "a challenge consists in the extension of the theory to include two - particle green s functions in a generalized variational principle . here",
    "the recently proposed functional - integral formulation of the sfa @xcite can be helpful .",
    "two - particle correlation functions are interesting by themselves and may furthermore facilitate an even greater flexibility in the choice of reference systems . at the same time",
    "such an approach could provide a conceptual clear way to treat models with non - local interactions .",
    "currently , this problem is circumvented by a more pragmatic decoupling procedure @xcite .",
