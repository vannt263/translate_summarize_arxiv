    "left - right symmetric models ( lrsm ) @xcite provide a framework within which spontaneous parity breaking as well as tiny neutrino masses @xcite can be successfully implemented without reference to very high scale physics such as grand unification .",
    "incorporating supersymmetry ( susy ) into it comes with other advantages like providing a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , and providing a cold dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the stability of lsp is guaranteed by r - parity , defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin of the particle .",
    "this is a discrete symmetry put by hand in mssm to keep the baryon number ( b ) and lepton number ( l ) violating terms away from the superpotential . in generic implementations of left - right symmetry ,",
    "r - parity is a part of the gauge symmetry and hence not ad - hoc like in the mssm . in one class of models  @xcite",
    ", spontaneous parity breaking is achieved without breaking r - parity .",
    "this was not possible in minimal supersymmetric left right(susylr ) models where the only way to break parity is to consider spontaneous r - parity violation @xcite .",
    "in minimal susylr model parity , @xmath6 gauge symmetry as well as r - parity break simultaneously by the vacuum expectation value of right handed sneutrino .",
    "spontaneous breaking of exact discrete symmetries like parity ( which we shall denote as d - parity hereafter ) , as well as r - parity have got cosmological implications since they lead to frustrated phase transitions leaving behind a network of domain walls ( dw ) .",
    "these domain walls , if not removed will be in conflict with the observed universe @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that planck scale suppressed non - renormalizable operators can be a source of domain wall instability .",
    "supersymmetry dictates the structure of these non - renormalizable terms but also gives rise to the gravitino overabundance problem . incorporating all these restrictions , the constraint on the d - parity breaking scale in r - parity conserving",
    "susylr models  @xcite has been discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we extend the analysis to a more general class of models where both r - parity and d - parity break spontaneously .",
    "it should be mentioned that the formation of domain walls is not generic in all left - right models .",
    "models where d - parity and @xmath6 gauge symmetry are broken at two different stages do not suffer from this problem @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a parity odd singlet field breaks the d - parity first and @xmath6 gauge symmetry gets broken at a later stage by either higgs triplets and higgs doublets .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dw - section ] we briefly review the domain wall dynamics . in section [ sec : susylr1 ]",
    "we discuss minimal susylr model with higgs triplets , constraints on the symmetry breaking scale from successful removal of domain wall as well as gauge coupling unification and in section [ sec : susylr2 ] we do this same analysis for minimal susylr model with higgs doublets .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "discrete symmetries and their spontaneous breaking are both common instances and desirable in model building .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of such discrete symmetries gives rise to a network of domain walls leaving the accompanying phase transition frustrated @xcite .",
    "the danger of a frustrated phase transition can therefore be evaded if a small explicit breaking of discrete symmetry can be introduced .    due to the smallness of such discrete symmetry breaking",
    ", the resulting domain walls may be relatively long lived and can dominate the universe for a long time . since this will be in conflict with the observed universe , these domain walls need to disappear at a very high energy scale ( at least before big bang nucleosynthesis ) . keeping this in mind , we summarize the three cases of domain wall dynamics discussed in @xcite , one of which originates in radiation dominated ( rd ) universe and destabilized also within the radiation dominated universe .",
    "this scenario was originally proposed by kibble @xcite and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "the second scenario was essentially proposed in @xcite , which consists of the walls originating in a radiation dominated phase , subsequent to which the universe enters a matter dominated ( md ) phase , either due to substantial production of heavy unwanted relics such as moduli , or simply due to a coherent oscillating scalar field .",
    "the third one is a variant of the md model in which the domain walls dominate the universe for a considerable epoch giving rise to a mild inflationary behavior or weak inflation ( wi ) @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the domain walls disappear before they come to dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "when a scalar field @xmath7 acquires a vev at a scale @xmath8 at some critical temperature @xmath9 , a phase transition occurs leading to the formation of domain walls .",
    "the energy density trapped per unit area of such a wall is @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics of the walls are determined by two quantitites , force due to tension @xmath11 and force due to friction @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average scale of radius of curvature prevailing in the wall complex , @xmath14 is the speed at which the domain wall is navigating through the medium and @xmath15 is the temperature .",
    "the epoch at which these two forces balance each other sets the time scale @xmath16 .",
    "putting all these together leads to the scaling law for the growth of the scale @xmath17 : @xmath18 the energy density of the domain walls goes as @xmath19 . in a radiation dominated era",
    "this @xmath20 is comparable to the energy density of the universe @xmath21 $ ] around time @xmath22 .",
    "the pressure difference arising from small asymmetry on the two sides of the wall competes with the two forces @xmath23 and @xmath24 discussed above . for @xmath25 to exceed either of these two quantities before @xmath26 @xmath27    similar analysis in the matter dominated era , originally considered in @xcite begins with the assumption that the initially formed wall complex in a phase transition is expected to rapidly relax to a few walls per horizon volume at an epoch characterized by hubble parameter value @xmath28 .",
    "thus the initial energy density of the wall complex is @xmath29 .",
    "this epoch onward the energy density of the universe is assumed to be dominated by heavy relics or an oscillating modulus field and in both the cases the scale factor grows as @xmath30 .",
    "the energy density scales as @xmath31 .",
    "if the domain wall ( dw ) complex remains frustrated , i.e. its energy density contribution @xmath32 , the hubble parameter at the epoch of equality of dw contribution with that of the rest of the matter is given by @xcite @xmath33 assuming that the domain walls start decaying as soon as they dominate the energy density of the universe , which corresponds to a temperature @xmath34 such that @xmath35 , the above equation gives @xmath36 under the assumption that the domain walls are formed at @xmath37 @xmath38 now from eq .",
    "( [ td ] ) @xmath39 demanding @xmath40 leads to @xmath41    the third possibility is the walls dominating the energy density of the universe for a limited epoch which leads to a mild inflation .",
    "this possibility was considered in @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the evolution of energy density of such walls can be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the scale factor at which domain walls start dominating ( decaying ) and @xmath44 is the corresponding time .",
    "if the epoch of domain wall decay is characterized by temperature @xmath34 , then @xmath45 and the above equation gives @xmath46 in the matter dominated era the energy densit of the moduli fields scale as @xmath47 using this in equation ( [ td1 ] ) gives @xmath48 domain walls start dominating the universe after the time of equality , @xmath49 .",
    "so the pressure difference across the walls when they start decaying is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 . replacing the value of @xmath52 from equation ( [ heq ] ) ,",
    "the pressure difference becomes @xmath53 unlike the previous two cases rd and md , here it will not be possible to estimate @xmath34 in terms of other mass scales and we will keep it as undetermined .",
    "we consider the minimal susylr model of kuchimanchi et al @xcite in this section .",
    "although the minimality of the higgs content is an attractive feature of this model , the authours concluded that d - parity can be spontaneously broken only at the expense of breaking r - parity spontaneously at the same energy scale by the vev of right handed sneutrino .",
    "since the r - parity violation(rpv ) is in the leptonic sector only , the dangerous proton decay problem can be evaded in this model .",
    "the models where left handed sneutrino vev gives rise to rpv are strongly disfavored by electroweak precision measurements @xcite .",
    "however there is no such strict constraints on models where right handed sneutrino vev gives rise to rpv provided the extra gauge boson masses lie above the allowed lower bounds @xcite .",
    "here we find another constraint on this rpv scale from domain wall removal as well as gauge coupling unification .",
    "the matter content of this model is @xmath54 @xmath55 the higgs sector of this minimal consists of the higgs bidoublets and higgs triplets @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 the renormalizable superpotential is @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are symmetric matrices .",
    "it has been shown that with this minimal field content it is not possible to break the d - parity spontaneously . adding a parity odd singlet",
    "also does not improve the situation .",
    "the authors showed that the d - parity breaking vacua in this case also give rise to the breaking of electromagnetic charge .",
    "the authors @xcite proposed an alternative scenario where it was shown that by allowing a non - zero vev for right handed sneutrino , @xmath62 it is possible to get d - parity breaking minima which preserve electromagnetic charge .",
    "however , the vev of sneutrino which has odd @xmath63 charge also gives rise to spontaneous r - parity violation .",
    "here we follow the approximations adopted by the authors to find a region in parameter space of the coupling constants giving rise to the desired minima .",
    "the first approximation is the one where they choose the parameter space , such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are smaller than the constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 . with this approximation",
    "the @xmath68-terms become weaker than the trilinear terms that contain the triplet scalars and the sleptons .",
    "the second approximation is made in order to maintain the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the parity breaking scale , i.e. @xmath69 . with these approximations the scalar potential can now be written as , @xmath70 + 4 \\lvert f   \\rvert^2(\\lvert \\tilde{l}^t_c\\tau_2 \\delta_c \\rvert^2+\\lvert   \\tilde{l}^t\\tau_2 \\delta \\rvert^2)+m'^2 \\text{tr } ( \\delta \\bar{\\delta}+\\delta_c \\bar{\\delta}_c + h.c . ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + [ \\tilde{l}^t\\tau_2 ( iv\\delta+im^*f\\bar{\\delta}^{\\dagger } ) \\tilde{l}+\\tilde{l}^t_c\\tau_2 ( iv\\delta_c+im^*f\\bar{\\delta}^{\\dagger}_c ) \\tilde{l}_c + h.c . ]",
    "\\label{eq : scalar - potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consider the case where the right handed fields getting a non - zero vev , at the same time the vev for the left handed fields is zero .",
    "so , @xmath71 @xmath72 now putting these vev s in the scalar potential eq.([eq : scalar - potential ] ) gives rise to @xmath73 minimising the above potential the authors get the solution for the parity breaking minima as @xmath74 since the original theory is left - right symmetric there exists an equivalent minima corresponding to @xmath75 .",
    "the degeneracy of these two equivalent vacua leads to the unavoidable consequences of formation of domain walls .",
    "for a successful phase transition accompanying the symmetry breaking , these domain walls should be unstable .",
    "we follow the idea@xcite where it is argued that planck sale suppressed non - renormalizable operators can potentially solve the domain wall problem .",
    "we adopt the technique developed in@xcite to find the operators suppressed by planck scale .",
    "and we find the constrains on the symmetry breaking scale from cosmological considerations .",
    "we now find the @xmath76 terms in the effective potential by expanding the k@xmath77hler potential and superpotential in powers of @xmath76 .",
    "we include the terms containing @xmath78 in the expansion .",
    "the k@xmath77hler potential in this model upto @xmath76 is @xmath79+\\text{tr}[\\delta_c \\delta^{\\dagger}_c   + \\bar{\\delta}_c \\bar{\\delta}^{\\dagger}_c]+\\frac{c_l}{m_{pl}}(l^t\\tau_2   \\delta l + l^t\\tau_2 \\bar{\\delta}^{\\dagger } l + h.c . )",

    "so the effective energy difference arising from the operators is given by , @xmath86 now we shall compare this @xmath25 with the case in a matter dominated era where we have calculated the energy density for the domain wall to decay . before going",
    "further we make some approximations .",
    "the constants @xmath87 and @xmath88 in eq.([eq : eff - delta - rho ] ) are the coefficients appearing in the trilinear terms in eq.([eq : scalar - potential ] ) .",
    "these trilinear terms are the soft terms .",
    "so the coefficients are of electroweak scale , @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 appear in the mass terms for @xmath92 and @xmath93 . since these triplet fields get their vev s at a scale @xmath8 , the scales @xmath90 and @xmath91 should be of order @xmath8 .",
    "but the scale of @xmath8 is higher than the electrowek scale , hence we find @xmath94 .",
    "so @xmath95 so the dominant term in eq.([eq : eff - delta - rho ] ) is , @xmath96 now by comparing , @xmath97 putting the electroweak scale as @xmath98gev and taking @xmath99 as @xmath100 we get the constraint on @xmath101 as @xmath102 comparing the obtained @xmath25 with the case in a radiation dominated era we get , @xmath103 proceeding as above we get the constraint on @xmath101 as @xmath104 taking the dimensionless parameters @xmath105 to be of order one , the equation [ eq : m_r - constrnt - md ] gives an upper bound on the scale @xmath8 in a matter dominated era @xmath106 similarly during the radiation dominated era , the equation [ eq : m_r - constrnt - rd ] gives an upper bound on @xmath8 @xmath107 allowing further fine tuning between @xmath108 and @xmath109 will make this bound even more strict .",
    "however as we will see below , such a low intermediate d - parity breaking scale is not favored from successful gauge coupling unification point of view which makes this model less attractive .    comparing the obtained @xmath25 with the weak inflation case we have @xmath110 taking the dimensionless coefficients to be of order one",
    ", we arrive at the following bound on @xmath8 @xmath111 thus for @xmath34 of the order of electroweak scale , @xmath8 remains just below the gravitino bound .",
    "however , if @xmath112 , then the @xmath8 is forced to be higher that @xmath113 which , as noted in @xcite can be problematic if the reheating temperature after the domain wall disappearance is comparable to the temperature scale of original phase transition . in that case , the universe would reheat to a temperature higher than @xmath113 giving rise to gravitino overabundance .",
    "successful gauge coupling unification at scale @xmath114 gev puts tight constraints on the intermediate symmetry breaking scales .",
    "assuming the higgs triplets to be as heavy as the the scale @xmath8 , we get a lower bound on the scale @xmath8 to be of the order of @xmath115 gev . a lower value of @xmath8 will make the couplings of @xmath63 and @xmath116 meet before the allowed unification scale from proton decay constraints .",
    "although for the minimal particle content , the @xmath117 couplings do not meet the other two at one point , we can always take into account of some additional fields in a grand unified theory ( gut ) like @xmath2 which survive the gut symmetry breaking and can be as light as the scale @xmath8 . here",
    "we consider three pairs of extra heavy colored superfields @xmath118 which can be naturally fitted within @xmath2 gut theory inside the representations @xmath119 .",
    "the resulting unification is shown in fig .",

    "spontaneous r - parity breaking can be achieved even without giving vev to the sneutrino fields .",
