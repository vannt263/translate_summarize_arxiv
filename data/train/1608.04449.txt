    "the past two decades have witnessed a rising interest in topologically ordered states , mainly due to the realization that their properties could be useful for fault tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the quantum double models introduced by kitaev demonstrated the existence quantum spin models with short - range interactions that have ground states exhibiting topological order and anyonic excitation spectrum .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the ground space degeneracy depends on the genus of the surface on which the model is defined .",
    "a characteristic of topologically ordered states in two dimensions is the appearance of elementary excitations with braid statistics , called anyons  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most well known model for anyons are the quasi - particle excitations of the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "braid statistics have also been studied in the context of local quantum physics  @xcite and gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "the fusion rules and braiding of anyons is encoded algebraically as a unitary modular tensor category  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the case of the representation theory of the quantum double for a finite group has been well studied  @xcite .",
    "kitaev s models are very special in the sense that they have frustration - free ground states and that the interactions terms in the hamiltonian are all mutually commuting .",
    "trivially , these models have a non - vanishing spectral gap above the ground state .",
    "the spectral gap is an important feature in the classification of topologically ordered ground states into a so - called topological phases  @xcite , and has important implications such as exponential decay of correlations  @xcite and entanglement area laws  @xcite .",
    "it was therefore important to show that this gap does not close for sufficiently small uniform perturbations of these models  @xcite .",
    "ground states of quantum lattice models is a well - studied subject .",
    "knowing the set of ground states is essential for understanding the properties of quantum many - body system at sufficiently low temperatures . in the mathematical analysis of certain statistical mechanics phenomena , such as equlibrium states , phases transitions , superselection sectors and phase classification ,",
    "it is often necessary or convenient to take the infinite volume limit ( or thermodynamic limit )  @xcite .",
    "general existence and decomposition properties have been mastered for some time  @xcite .",
    "the problem of proving that one has found the complete set of ground states for a given model , however , has been solved only in a few cases .    in this work ,",
    "we study quantum double models for abelian groups , in their implementation as quantum spin hamiltonians with short - range interactions as defined by kitaev  @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is the toric code model , which corresponds to the choice @xmath4 .",
    "the abelian quantum double model is particularly interesting because it has all of the characteristic features of topologically ordered systems , while at the same time being simple enough to be tackled directly .",
    "the main features of the model are : it is exactly solvable in the sense that the hamiltonian can be explicitly diagonalized ; the dimension of the space of ground states of the models defined on a compact orientable surface is a topological invariant and corresponds to the number of flat @xmath1-connections on the lattice ( up to conjugation ) ; there is a spectral gap above the ground state ; the elementary excitations correspond to quasi - particles with braid statistics .",
    "the focus of this paper is the set of infinite volume ground states of the model for finite abelian groups .",
    "although the quantum double models are exactly solvable in finite volume , much less is known about the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the first results in this direction are due to alicki , fannes and hordecki  @xcite .",
    "they showed that in the case @xmath5 , also known as the toric code , there is a unique frustration - free ground state , which coincides with the translation invariant ground state .",
    "this uniqueness property is not general @xcite , but is related to topological order in the ground state .",
    "the difficulty of solving the full ground state problem can be understood as follows .",
    "if @xmath6 is the derivation generating the dynamics , one has to find _ all _ states @xmath7 on the quasi - local algebra @xmath8 of observables that satisfy @xmath9 for all @xmath10 in the domain of @xmath6 .",
    "it is possible to construct ground states as weak@xmath3 limits of finite volume ground states , but even though the boundary goes to infinity in a sense , the resulting state strongly depends on the boundary conditions chosen for the finite volume ground states .",
    "the main result of this paper is a complete classification of the set of infinite volume ground states for kitaev s quantum double model for finite abelian groups .",
    "we find that the set of ground states can be decomposed into @xmath11 sectors .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the ground state sectors and the superselection sectors defined in @xcite . in particular",
    ", each sector corresponds to a different anyon type .",
    "the strategy of the proof is to reduce the infinite volume calculation to a finite volume calculation .",
    "in particular , we find a boundary term for every finite box such that the restriction of any infinite volume ground state to the box is a ground state of the finite volume hamiltonian plus the boundary term .",
    "this strategy is motivated by the fact that infinite volume ground states minimize energy in a local region among all states that are equivalent in the complement of that region @xcite , and resembles the classical dobrushin - lanford - ruelle theory of boundary conditions for the restriction of infinite volume equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "our analysis is deeply connected to the notions of topological order , superselection sectors and the fact that the anyon quasi - particles of the quantum double models are time invariant . in analogy with the analysis of doplicher , haag and roberts  @xcite in local quantum physics  @xcite , it is possibly to analyze the different types of anyons in the system , to obtain the modular tensor category @xmath12 describing all their properties .",
    "this was done in  @xcite for the abelian quantum double models , and we will use some of these results here .",
    "it is often surprisingly difficult to classify the full set of ground states in the thermodynamic limit . to our knowledge",
    ", the complete ground state problem has only been solved for the one - dimensional @xmath13-model by araki and matsui @xcite , for the one - dimensional @xmath14-models by matsui @xcite and koma and nachtergaele @xcite , and for the finite - range spin chains with a unique frustration free matrix product ground state by ogata  @xcite . to make progress ,",
    "one typically has to pair the ground state problem with model specific notions ; in the @xmath13-model it was the jordan - wigner transformation to fermions and in the @xmath14-model and the frustration - free spin chains it was a connection to zero - energy states @xcite .",
    "as far as we are aware , our result is the first solution to the ground state problem for a quantum model in two dimensions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : mainresults ] we introduce the model and state the main results .",
    "we describe the superselection sectors in section  [ sec : supersel ] and present a new result that equates a boundary projector to a sum of products of local projectors .",
    "a detailed presentation of the main results and the proofs are in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the lack of stability for the infinite volume ground state condition , and some difficulties that appear in the analysis for the non - abelian case in section [ sec : con ] .",

    "the ribbon operators create a pair of excitations , one at each end of the ribbon .",
    "in addition , the different types of excitations are labeled by pairs @xmath85 and the charges at each end are _ conjugate _ to each other . in other words ,",
    "the _ global _ charge does not change after applying a ribbon operator .",
    "moreover , when acting with a ribbon operator on the ground state , the resulting state only depends on the endpoints of the ribbon , i.e.  the location of the excitations .",
    "a similar thing is true for configurations of multiple charges , up to a phase .",
    "this phase can be explained by the anyonic nature of the charges : exchanging two of them gives an overall phase , much like interchanging two fermions yield a minus sign .",
    "the local hilbert spaces can be obtained completely by such operations , so that we can define a basis by specifying the charge at each site ( with an additional constraint on the total charge ) .",
    "this observation will play an important role in our proof .",
    "let @xmath221 be a sequence of finite volume ground states for the regions @xmath68 .",
    "a frustration - free ground state of the quantum double model @xmath222 , can be constructed by taking a converging subsequence of the family of states @xmath223 as @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is an arbitrary extension of the state @xmath226 to the quasi - local algebra @xmath8 ( in particular , we could choose a product state ) . for any @xmath36 and @xmath37 choose @xmath227 large enough such that @xmath228 . since @xmath229 is a ground state for the finite model it follows that @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "this is the frustration - freeness property .",
    "ground states of the quantum double model are locally indistinguishable , so weak@xmath3 limits of sequences of such states will always converge to the same state .",
    "it turns out that this is the only frustration - free ground state ( that is , satisfying equation  ) of the model .",
    "we list some properties of this state in the following proposition :    ( @xcite ) let @xmath222 be the frustration - free ground state of the quantum double model obtained as a weak@xmath3 limit of finite volume ground states .",
    "then ,    a.   if @xmath7 is a frustration - free ground state then @xmath232 , b.   @xmath222 is a pure state , c.   let @xmath233 be a gns - representation for @xmath222 and @xmath234 be the hamiltonian in this gns representation .",
    "then , @xmath235 with a simple ground state eigenvector @xmath236 .",
    "the first property is in fact a general property for frustration - free models satisfying a local indistinguishability condition , ( for the definition see @xcite ) .",
    "the frustration - free ground state of the quantum double model satisfies the local indistinguishability condition @xcite .",
    "the last property follows from an application of strong resolvent convergence ( see for example theorem viii.24 of @xcite ) and shows that the quantum double model has a spectral gap in its frustration - free ground state . as a consequence of local indistinguishablity ,",
    "the gap is stable under local perturbations @xcite .      in the finite volume ,",
    "elementary excitations are constructed by violating one of the frustration - freeness ground state conditions .",
    "these excitations must come in pairs since they are generated by open ribbon operators . by introducing a boundary condition to the hamiltonian",
    ", we generate ground states which have one excitation in the bulk and one on the boundary . in the infinite volume , this is equivalent to moving one of the excitations off to infinity , thereby isolating a single excitation in the bulk . by construction ,",
    "these states will be ground states in the infinite volume .",
    "one way to understand this intuitively is that even though there is an excitation , we can not lower the energy of the system with local operations .",
    "it is possible to move the excitation around ( thereby locally decreasing the energy ) , but we can not get rid of it completely with local operations , and the moved excitation will increase the local energy density at its new location .",
    "the idea is to use the projections that were introduced in the previous section to define boundary conditions which can compensate for the existence of an excitation in the bulk . recall that these projections are supported on the boundary of @xmath68 .",

    "this result allows us to decompose the ground state space into different sectors corresponding to the different charges :    the ground state space has a natural decomposition @xmath274    this follows from lemma [ lem : gsspan ] and the relation .",
    "we now come to states in the thermodynamic limit that describe a single excitation .",
    "such states may be constructed on the quasi - local algebra by moving one of the excitations in a pair off to infinity .",
    "let @xmath99 be a ribbon extending to infinity such that @xmath275 and @xmath276 , where @xmath276 means that the ribbon goes to infinity in any direction .",
    "we assume that it does not `` loop back '' , in the sense that if @xmath277 is the ribbon consists of the first @xmath278 parts of @xmath99 , then for any fixed point in the lattice , the distance to the endpoint of @xmath277 that is not fixed goes to infinity as @xmath278 goes to infinity .",

    "indeed , @xmath282 is an infinite volume ground state since for all @xmath283 we have that @xmath284   = \\lim_{l{\\rightarrow}\\infty } [ h_l^{\\epsilon,\\mu } , a]$ ] , and from lemma  [ lem : gsspan ] , @xmath285 .",
    "since @xmath286 is a positive operator , the result follows .",
    "the states @xmath280 were first introduced in @xmath287 .",
    "they showed the states can be constructed from the frustration - free ground state via an automorphism , @xmath288 , where @xmath289 the limit converges in norm for each @xmath290 and defines an outer automorphism .",
    "superselection sectors arise because the quasi - local algebra has many inequivalent representations .",
    "most representations do not have any physical relevance ( for example , because the energy is unbounded ) , so it is important to restrict the class of representations of interest .",

    "another example would be electric charge . here",
    "we will use the term `` charge '' in a generalized sense , as a label of the different particle types . once we can identify different classes of representations with charges ,",
    "it is reasonable to impose additional constraints .",
    "in particular , we can impose certain locality conditions , and demand that we are able to move the localization regions around .",
    "a superselection criterion is a rule that tells us precisely which representations we select in the end .",
    "the doplicher - haag - roberts ( dhr ) analysis in algebraic quantum field theory showed that starting from a vacuum state and a physically motivated superselection criterion , one could recover a family of superselection sectors corresponding to the global gauge group @xcite .",
    "this allows one to recover all physically relevant properties of the charges , such as their particle statistics .",
    "a similar analysis can been done for the quantum double models , producing the single excitations ground states as the irreducible objects in each superselection sector @xcite .",
    "the role of the vacuum is played by the translation invariant frustration - free ground state .    for the quantum double models the relevant criterion is as follows .",

    "physically , to detect the charge of a state in the representation @xmath292 one needs to measure the value of a `` wilson loop '' .",
    "if such loops around the charge are not allowed ( as in the selection criterion , due to the absence of the cone ) , the charge can not be detected .",
    "the superselection structure of the quantum double model can be analyzed in the same spirit as the dhr program .",
    "the sector structure is summarized in the following proposition    [ prop : singleexc]@xcite let @xmath298 be the gns triple for @xmath282 .",

    "the classification of infinite volume ground states then simplifies to a classification of infinite volume limits of finite volume ground states .",
    "these finite volume ground states are well understood by the results in the previous section , and this allows us to obtain our classification .",

    "we have proved that the set of known ground states for kitaev s quantum double model is complete in the case of finite abelian groups .",
    "a natural question is if the results can be extended to non - abelian groups .",
    "the main technical challenge is that the quantum double @xmath115 has higher dimensional irreducible representations . in physical terms , this manifests itself in the presence of _ non - abelian _ anyons . as a result ,",
    "the structure of the ribbon operators and quasi - particles is much richer than that of the abelian case . in particular",
    ", the quasi - particle excitations no longer decompose into simply electric and magnetic type , since they have to account for the more complicated structure of @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , the boundary operators we use in lemmas  [ lem : globprojboundaryop ] and  [ lem : gshambound ] would need to be generalized to account for this structure .",
    "since the fusion rules are non - abelian , the fusion of two excitations does not always have a definite outcome .",
    "this makes it more difficult to sum over all admissible configurations that lead to a given charge in the region .",
    "in addition , the charged sectors are generated by endomorphism that are not automorphisms in general , and that are less straightforward to construct  @xcite .",
    "a current challenge in mathematical physics is the classification of gapped ground state phases @xcite .",
    "one approach to classifying a phase is to construct a complete set of invariants . by definition ,",
    "an invariant is a quantity that is constant within a phase .",
    "consequently , if an invariant is computed for two systems and is found to take different values , the systems must be in different phases . in the literature a topological phase is often defined as an open region in a space of hamiltonians where there is a non - vanishing gap above the ground state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the construction of invariants can be expected to rely on the existence of a spectral gap . in the quantum double models , while it is known that the gap above the vacuum state is stable under small uniform perturbations , we do not expect that the charged ground states will survive a generic perturbation of this model since the anyon quasi - particles will in general not appear as time - invariant states  @xcite .",
    "our classification of the complete ground state space of the quantum double model for abelian groups gives an example that shows that the set of infinite volume ground states is generally not an invariant of a phase . from the physical point of view , however , the invariance of the structure of anyon quasi - particles is usually taken as fact .",
    "there are few mathematically rigorous results in this direction @xcite .",
    "we hope that our results are a first step in rigorously studying the stability properties of the superselection structure of quantum double models .",
