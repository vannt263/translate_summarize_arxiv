    "the response of a fermi gas to an external , time - dependent perturbation is a well - known hard problem .",

    "we then show that the finite temperature problem is equivalent to a different zero temperature rh problem through the bijective mapping of the time variable @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . in simple ( i.e. abelian ) cases ,",
    "this allows us to construct the explicit solution , but generally the resulting rh problem remains highly nontrivial .",
    "we show , however , on the concrete example of the nonequilibrium problem of refs .   how the equivalence between finite and zero temperature solutions can be explored to construct approximate solutions to the corresponding rh problem in the high and low temperature limits .",

    "an explicit calculation of the integral is possible and leads to a beta function , yet the following estimates are physically more instructive :    at zero temperature both , the singularity at @xmath147 as well as the power - law tails for @xmath280 contribute equally to the integral . in the equilibrium situation , we obtain the well - known fermi - edge singularity , a power - law dependence on energy , @xmath281 . for @xmath183 , @xmath163 and the exponent , acquire an imaginary correction .",

    "the nonequilibrium effects are completely washed out . for small energies , @xmath286 ,",
    "the exponential decay then dominates the integral , and the singularity is broadened to a lorentzian with a width proportional to @xmath287 . on the other hand , for high energies @xmath288 , the exponential decay is slow compared to the quickly oscillating phase factor .",

    "away from the resonance , but still for @xmath286 , the transition rate has a power - law dependence on energy , which eventually turns into an activated behavior for @xmath290 .",

    "the generalization to nonzero temperatures is immediate : every excited state of @xmath325 particles yields a similar determinant of @xmath29 for a different selection of @xmath325 particles @xmath330 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath310 weights these states with the boltzmann factors @xmath331 .",
    "since these are exponentials of single - particle operators , they just provide the weights @xmath332 for the occupied single - particle states that sum up to the fermi function when summing over all excited states .",
