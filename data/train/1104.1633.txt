    "understanding the observed pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixing  @xcite constitutes one of the deepest challenges in particle physics .",
    "flavor symmetries provide a very useful approach towards reducing the number of free parameters describing the fermion sector  @xcite .",
    "it has long been advocated that grand unification offers a suitable framework to describe flavor . in what follows",
    "we will adopt the alternative approach , assuming that flavor is implemented directly at the 21 level .",
    "typically this requires several @xmath2 doublet scalars in order to break spontaneously the flavor symmetry so as to obtain an acceptable structure for the masses and mixing matrices .",
    "( one may alternatively introduce `` flavons '' instead of additional higgs doublets , but in this case one would have to give up renormalizability ) .    in order to construct a `` realistic '' extension of the standard model ( sm ) with flavor symmetry",
    "one needs a suitable alignment of the scalar vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in the theory  @xcite .",
    "there are several multi - doublet extensions of the sm with flavor in the market , but renormalizable supersymmetric extensions of the sm with a flavor symmetry are only a few  @xcite , usually because the existence of additional higgs doublets spoils the unification of the coupling constants .    here",
    "we choose to renounce to this theoretical argument , noting that gauge coupling unification may happen in multi - doublet schemes due to other effects .",
    "what we now present is a supersymmetric extension of the sm based on the @xmath0 group where all the matter fields as well as the higgs doublets belong to the same @xmath0 representation , namely , the triplet .",
    "this leads us to two theoretical predictions .",
    "the first a mass relation @xmath3 involving down - type quarks and charged lepton mass ratios .",
    "such relation can be obtained by a suitable combination of the three georgi - jarlskog ( gj ) mass relations  @xcite , @xmath4 which arise within a particular ansatz for the su(5 ) model and hold at the unification scale .",
    "in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ gj ] ) , our relation requires no unification group and holds at the electroweak scale .",
    "it would , in any case , be rather robust against renormalization effects as it involves only mass ratios .",
    "the second prediction obtained in our flavor model is a correlation between the cabibbo angle for the quarks and the so - called `` reactor angle '' @xmath1 characterizing the strength of cp violation in neutrino oscillations  @xcite . within a reasonable approximation",
    "we find @xmath5 which arises mainly from the down - type quark sector  @xcite with a correction coming from the up isospin diagonalization matrix .",
    "this is a very interesting relation , discussed below in more detail .",
    "here we propose a supersymmetric model based on an @xmath0 flavor symmetry realized in an 21 gauge framework .",
    "the field representation content is given in table  [ tab : multiplet1 ] .",
    "note that all quarks and leptons transform as @xmath0 triplets .",
    "similarly the higgs superfields with opposite hypercharge characteristic of the mssm are now upgraded into two sets , also transforming as @xmath0 triplets .",
    "note that since all matter fields transform in the same way under the flavor symmetry one may in principle embed the model into a grand - unified scheme .",
    "however , given the large number of scalar doublets , gauge coupling unification must proceed differently , see , for example , ref .",

    "only the first is viable and we verify that minimization leads to this solution within a wide region of parameters . by adding @xmath0 soft breaking terms to the @xmath0-invariant scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) @xmath13 one finds that @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 +      by using @xmath0 product rules it is straightforward to show that the charged fermion mass matrix takes the following universal structure  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes any charged lepton , up- or down - type quarks .",
    "note that , in addition to the `` texture '' zeros in the diagonal , one has additional relations among the parameters .",
    "this may be seen explicitly by rewriting eq .",

    "( [ y ] ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thanks to the fact that the same higgs doublet @xmath25 couples to the lepton and to the down - type quarks one has , in addition , the following relations @xmath26 involving down - type quarks and charged leptons .",

    "( [ eq : rel2 ] ) it follows that @xmath32 a formula relating quark and lepton mass ratios ( to a very good approximation this formula also holds for complex yukawa couplings ) .",
    "this relation is a strict prediction of our model , and appears in a way similar to the celebrated su(5 ) mass relation , despite the fact that we have not assumed any unified group , but just the 21 gauge structure .",
    "it allows us to compute the down quark mass in terms of the charged fermion masses and the @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks , as @xmath35 this mass formula predicts the down quark mass at the scale of the @xmath36 boson mass , to lie in the region @xmath37 at 1@xmath38  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "+      to the renormalizable model we have so far we now add an effective dimension - five @xmath0-preserving lepton - number violating operator @xmath39 where the @xmath0-tensor @xmath40 takes into account all the possible contractions of the product of four @xmath0 triplets   within various seesaw schemes  @xcite can , of course , be envisaged . ] .",
    "neutrino masses are induced after electroweak symmetry breaking from the operator in eq.([nudim5 ] ) . in order to determine the flavor structure of the resulting mass matrix we take the limit where the vev hierarchy @xmath41 holds , leading to  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are coupling constants , while @xmath45 and @xmath46 already been introduced above in the up quark sector .",
    "the best fit of neutrino oscillation data  @xcite yields maximally mixed @xmath47 and @xmath48 neutrinos .",
    "this is possible , in the basis where charged lepton is diagonal , if and only if the light - neutrino mass matrix is approximately @xmath49 invariant . in turn",
    "this holds true if @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath52 the `` atmospheric angle '' deviates from the maximality .",
    "we have verified that for @xmath53 the atmospheric angle is within its 3  @xmath38 allowed range .",
    "in the cp conserving limit we have taken so far we have in total 14 free parameters to describe the fermion sector : six @xmath27 and @xmath28 parameters ( three for each charged fermion - type ) , plus four @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( here only down - type are counted , in view of eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) ) , plus four parameters describing the neutrino mass induced by the dimension-5 operator : @xmath54 .",
    "these parameters describe 18 observables , which may be taken as the 9 charged fermion masses , the two neutrino squared mass differences describing neutrino oscillations , the three neutrino mixing angles , the neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass parameter , the cabbibo angle , in addition to @xmath55 and @xmath56 . hence we have four relations .",
    "the first of these we have already seen , namely the mass relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ours ] ) and fig",
    ".  [ figmass ] .",
    "the second is a quark - lepton mixing angle relation concerning the cabibbo angle @xmath57 and the `` reactor angle '' @xmath1 describing neutrino oscillations . to derive it",
    "note first that the matrix in eq.([mf ] ) is diagonalized on the left by a rotation in the 12 plane , namely @xmath58    in order to give an analytical expression for the relation between cabbibo and reactor angles , we neglect mixing of the third family of quarks and go in the limit where our neutrino mass matrix , eq .",
    "( 15 ) is @xmath49 invariant , that is @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this approximation ,",
    "the reactor mixing angle is given by @xmath61 using our mass relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ours ] ) one finds that the cabbibo angle may be written as @xmath62 comparing eq .",
    "( [ t13 - 1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ tc-1 ] ) leads immediately to equation ( [ eq:12q-13l ] ) . in order to display this prediction",
    "graphically we take the quark masses at 1  @xmath38 , obtaining the curved band shown in fig .",
    "the narrow horizontal band indicates current determination of the cabbibo angle , while the two vertical dashed lines represent the expected sensitivities of the double - chooz  @xcite and daya - bay  @xcite experiments on the `` reactor mixing angle '' @xmath1 .",
    "the curved line corresponds to the analytical approximation for the best fit value of the quark masses in eq .",
    "( [ eq:12q-13l ] ) .",
    "clearly the width of the curved band characterizing our prediction is dominated by quark mass determination uncertainties . +    -1",

    "the predicted values obtained for these are too small so that in its simplest presentation described above our model can not describe the cp violation found in the decays of neutral kaons .",
    "however there is a simple solution which maintains the good predictions described above , namely , adding colored vector - like @xmath66 singlet states . in this case",
    "acceptable values for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , leading to adequate cp violation can arise solely from non - unitarity effects of the quark mixing matrix . +",
    "we proposed a supersymmetric extension of the standard model with an @xmath0 flavor symmetry , where all matter fields in the model transform as triplets of the flavor group .",
    "charged fermion masses arise from renormalizable yukawa couplings while neutrino masses are treated in an effective way .",
    "the scheme illustrates how , in combination with supersymmetry , flavor symmetry may relate quarks with leptons , even in the absence of a grand - unification group .",
    "two good predictions emerge : ( i ) a relation between down - type quarks and charged lepton masses , and ( ii ) a correlation between the cabibbo angle in the quark sector , and the reactor angle @xmath1 characterizing cp violation in neutrino oscillations , which lies within the sensitivities of upcoming experiments .",
    "although the predicted values for the other mixing parameters @xmath67 and @xmath56 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix are too small , we mentioned a simple way to circumvent this , making the scheme fully realistic .    finally note that , with few exceptions such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite , grand - unified flavor models are not more predictive than the novel idea proposed here and illustrate through this simple scheme .",
    "as it stands the model fits well with the idea that gauge coupling unification may be an effect of the presence of extra dimensions rather than of grand - unified interactions  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , we wish to stress that our model is manifestfly embeddable into a standard grand - unified scenario , which would result in further predictive power .",
