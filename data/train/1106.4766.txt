    "the leavitt path algebras were introduced in @xcite and @xcite as algebraic analogs of the @xmath3-algebras  ( [ 19 ] ) and the study of their algebraic structure has been the subject of a series of papers in recent years ( see , for e.g. , @xcite - @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we develop the theory of the prime ideals of the leavitt path algebras @xmath2 for an arbitrary sized graph @xmath0 . here",
    "the graph @xmath0 is arbitrary in the sense that no restriction is placed either on the number of vertices in @xmath0 or on the number of edges emitted by a single vertex in @xmath0  ( such as row - finite or countable ) .",
    "we first give complete characterizations ,  in terms of the generators , of the prime ideals as well as the primitive ideals of the leavitt path algebra @xmath2 .",

    "our investigation shows that the non - graded prime ideals of a leavitt path algebra @xmath2 are always primitive and , as also noted in @xcite , there are graded prime ideals of @xmath2 which are not primitive .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation for the graph c*-algebras in which there is no distinction between the prime and the primitive ideals ( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) . using our characterization of right (= left ) primitive ideals of a leavitt path algebra , we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph @xmath0 under which every prime ideal of @xmath2 is primitive .",
    "examples are constructed to illustrate the different possibilities for the prime and the primitive spectrum of @xmath2 . in the case",
    "when @xmath0 is a row - finite graph , it was shown in @xcite  that a bijection exists between the set of prime ideals of the leavitt path algebra @xmath2  and a certain set which involves subsets of vertices ( called maximal tails ) and the prime spectrum of @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this was analogous to the work done in @xcite for graph @xmath3- algebras . in this paper , we extend and sharpen the bijective correspondence of @xcite to the case when @xmath0 is an arbitrary - sized graph .",
    "there are a number of applications of our main result ( theorem [ main theorem ] ) .",
    "first we describe those graphs @xmath0 for which every non - zero prime ideal of @xmath2 is maximal and this leads to the characterization the leavitt path algebras whose krull dimension is zero .",
    "examples are constructed of leavitt path algebras @xmath2 with various prescribed finite or infinite krull dimension . as another application , we show that a graph @xmath0 satisfies the condition ( k ) if and only if every prime ideal of @xmath2 is graded .",
    "next we describe the minimal prime ideals of a leavitt path algebra .",
    "the height @xmath7 prime ideals play an impotant part in the study of commutative rings and algebraic geometry . as a first step to examine their role in the study of leavitt path algebras ,",
    "we characterize not only the height @xmath7 prime ideals but also the co - height @xmath7 prime ideals of @xmath2 in terms of the graphical properties of @xmath0 .",
