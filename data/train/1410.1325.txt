    "this paper can be treated as an addition to our recent work @xcite devoted to a reanalysis of the radial velocity ( rv ) data for a unique multi - planet host star hd  82943 .",
    "here we only briefly summarize the most important of our previous results ( sect .  [ sec_oldres ] ) , and present new ones , related to seeking the optimal observation dates for this star ( sect .",
    "[ sec_plan ] ) .",
    "in our work we used the entire set of the rv data currently available for hd  82943 in the public literature .",
    "these include the old coralie @xcite and the recent keck @xcite data .",
    "the keck data were separated in two independent subsets that were acquired before and after a hardware upgrade .",
    "the primary results concerning our re - analysis of these data are described in @xcite .",
    "thus we do not duplicate this discussion here , except for a brief summary of the conclusions :    1 .",
    "the keck and coralie data are not in a good agreement with each other : fitting the entire data set plainly leads to a severely unstable orbital configuration of the two major planets _ b _ and _ c_. 2 .",
    "one of the reasons for this mutual inconsistency is the likely presence of an additional systematic variation in the coralie ( but not keck ) data with a period close to a year .",
    "likely , this variation appeared due to some imperfections of the spectrum processing algorithm used for coralie .",
    "3 .   after removal of the coralie annual variation",
    ", the rv data still contain a significant periodicity with a period of @xmath0  d. we interpret this periodicity as a hint of the third planet that was previously suspected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an rv fit implying a stable planetary configuration can be obtained only by including both the third planet and the coralie annual term in the rv model . without these terms , the nominal ( best fitting ) solution appears unstable due to an antialigned initial apsidal state of the two major planets , and forcing this configuration to be stable would infer an unsuitably large shift of the fit from its nominal position .",
    "5 .   the planets in the best fitting configuration lie near the three - planet resonance with the periods ratio @xmath1 .",
    "the motion of the first two planets is truly resonant ( a libration ) in the vicinity of an aligned apsidal corotation resonance ( acr ) , while the orbit of the third planet is rather uncertain and its orbital evolution can represent a libration ( i.e. a true resonance ) as well as a circulation ( not a genuine resonance ) .",
    "the structure of the dynamical space in the vicinity of the third planet s orbit is pretty complicated and involves resonant domains intervening with the non - resonant ones .",
    "clearly , the orbital and dynamical structure of the hd  82943 system is still rather uncertain . in view of this , it may be useful to apply some optimal planning routines , in order to predict the time segments in future in which the new rv observations would improve or knowledge about the system , as well as to identify the time ranges where the new observations would be almost useless .",
    "we solve this task by means of the optimal planning approaches described in @xcite . in this method we should select the entire set of the fitted parameters , or any their subset , or even a set of some other quantities expressed by smooth functions of the original parameters .",
    "our goal is to find an optimal time for a new observation in the future , in order to achieve a maximum reduction of the uncertainties in the targeted quantities .",
    "here we adopt the so - called d - optimality criterion , in which the `` reduction '' of a multi - dimensional uncertainty is treated in terms of the volumes ratio for the relevant uncertainty ellipsoids ( or determinants of the relevant covariance matrices ) .",
    ".prescribed observations scheduling goals for hd  82943 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_goals ]    in this work we consider the three - planet fit with the eccentricity of the third planet always fixed at zero .",
    "otherwise this eccentricity is ill determined and generates dramatic non - linearity effects , which are not desirable .",
    "four sets of target quantities to refine were considered in this work , defining four scheduling `` goals '' .",
    "these goals are described in table  [ tab_goals ] .",
    "the goal  3 from this table is defined in a rather complicated manner .",
    "its purpose is to refine our knowledge about the position of the dynamical system relatively to the acr of the two major planets .",
    "this information is important for the long - term dynamics and the stability of the system @xcite . in this case",
    "the set of target quantities includes @xmath2 partial derivatives of the averaged hamiltonian of the two major planets .",
    "when all these derivatives vanish , we deal with an exact acr , so by reducing their uncertainties we can improve our knowledge about whether the system is close to or far from the acr .",
    "the derivatives are computed using the method from @xcite .",
    ".,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    the results of the computation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sched ] , where we plot the graphs of a function that indicates how much the uncertainty of the target quantities would reduce , provided that we make a single observation at the time given in the abscissa .",
    "this relative reduction is normalized so that it corresponds to a single degree of freedom in the set of target quantities .",

    "the peaks of the efficiency functions are rather narrow , meaning that allocating observation time randomly is not the best course of actions for hd  82943 . 2 .",
    "the task of refining the orbital inclination looks antagonistic to refining the most other parameters .",
    "but nonetheless the relevant optimal time ranges tend to stick together side - by - side .",
    "we have good chances to refine the accuracy of the usual planetary parameters by up to @xmath64 in the forthcoming observing seasons .",
    "but the orbital inclination , which is only constrained thanks to the gravitational planet - planet perturbations , is an exception .",
    "it looks unrealistic to drastically improve the accuracy of this inclination before 2020s , when the orbital apsidal lines make a larger fraction of a secular revolution .",
    "the refining of the parameters of the third planet seems rather difficult both in the near and distant future .",
    "it seems that to reach this goal we should just patiently accumulate more and more observations ."
