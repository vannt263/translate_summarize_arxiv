    "specifically , the spin rate accelerates ( decelerates ) if the sail is inclined so as to spiral the orbit outwards ( inwards ) in the solar system .",
    "the angular acceleration of the rotating sail is approximately given by @xmath3 where the sail inclination angle @xmath0 is taken to be positive if the sail accelerates away from the sun ( i.e.  if the e - sail thrust component along the orbital velocity vector is positive )",
    ". equation [ eq : angacc ] leads to exponential change of @xmath4 unless compensated by spin rate control .",
    "the e - sail also needs spin rate control to generate angular momentum during deployment of the tethers .",
    "cold gas thrusters and ionic liquid field effect electric propulsion ( feep ) thrusters have been prototyped for spin rate control yielding remoteunit mass of 0.56 kg @xcite , and solar photonic blades have been considered at lower technical readiness level ( trl ) @xcite . here",
    "we propose a new intrinsic method of controlling the spin rate by the e - sail force itself .",
    "consider an e - sail as in fig .  [ fig:3d ]",
    "where now the auxiliary tethers ( auxtethers ) can at least partly be put under voltage .",
    "a segment of auxtether generates e - sail thrust which is perpendicular to it if one neglects end effects .",
    "we now want to show that if the auxtether voltage can be controlled independently from the adjacent maintether voltage , pure e - sail spin rate control becomes possible .     plane and viewed along @xmath5 .",

    "spinplane e - sail force component @xmath7 is smaller than in ( b).,width=529 ]    figure [ fig : principle]a shows an e - sail inclined at angle @xmath0 to the sw flow and one of its charged maintethers which at the moment happens to lie in the @xmath1 plane i.e.  in the plane of the figure . at this moment",
    "the maintether in question generates thrust vector @xmath6 which is perpendicular to the tether spinplane ( dashed line ) , i.e.  inclined by angle @xmath0 with respect to the sw .",
    "figure [ fig : principle]b shows the same maintether a quarter cycle later when it is aligned along @xmath5 axis .",
    "now the maintether is already perpendicular to the sw so that the thrust @xmath6 is simply aligned with the sw .",
    "@xmath6 can be decomposed into spinplane component @xmath7 and spinplane normal component @xmath9 .",
    "the spinplane component of the e - sail thrust tends to decrease the tether s @xmath4 when it climbs upstream .",
    "the reverse happens half a cycle later when the tether moves downstream so that overall no change in spin rate is generated .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : principle]c there is a short charged auxtether segment attached to the tip of the maintether at the same moment as in [ fig : principle]b .",
    "the e - sail thrust vector @xmath6 is now a vector sum of the maintether thrust and the auxtether thrust .",
    "the maintether thrust is along the sw flow as in [ fig : principle]b , but the auxtether thrust is perpendicular to the auxtether , i.e.  perpendicular to the spin plane . as a result , @xmath6 is not fully aligned with the sw and its spinplane component @xmath10 is smaller . to prevent the sail from turning ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath11 has the same value when the tether is moving upstream and downstream .",
    "however , the spinplane component @xmath10 can be different because the same @xmath11 can be obtained by different combinations of the maintether and auxtether voltages .",
    "effectively , we have two control parameters ( maintether voltage and auxtether voltage ) which allows us to control the two thrust parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 freely . by having the same @xmath11 but different @xmath10 in the upstream and downstream portions of the maintether s cycle",
    ", one can modify the sail s spin rate while keeping its orientation fixed .",
    "consider an e - sail consisting of @xmath12 maintethers of length @xmath13 , approximating each by a point mass @xmath14 located at the tip so that @xmath14 contains the masses of the maintether , the remote unit and the associated auxtether segment .",
    "assume that the e - sail thrust per unit length @xmath15 at solar distance @xmath16 ( select @xmath17 au for definiteness ) is @xmath18 .",
    "at other distances @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "assume also that at each solar distance @xmath19 the spin rate @xmath4 is chosen such that the centrifugal tension of the maintether is @xmath21 times the e - sail force acting on it where one typically requires @xmath22 for stability .",
    "this implies @xmath23 so that @xmath24 equation ( [ eq : angacc ] ) gives the secular angular acceleration due to the orbital coriolis effect .",
    "the corresponding coriolis torque is @xmath25 thus , eq .  ( [ eq : tauc ] )",
    "gives the torque that must be compensated by the electrified auxtether e - sail effect .",
    "consider the tether when it s pointed along @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : principle]b , c ) where the length of its associated auxtether segment is @xmath26 .",
    "if the maintether has voltage and the auxtether has not , the e - sail thrust acting on the maintether is @xmath27 whose components are @xmath28 and @xmath29 . if both tethers have voltage , then @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a dimensionless factor by which the maintether voltage is modulated ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "requiring that @xmath11 causes the same torque in both cases implies @xmath34 and the difference in spin axis aligned torques becomes @xmath35    let us assume that the auxtether voltage is used only when the tether is close to vertical , in phase angle interval of length @xmath36 , so that the average e - sail torque due to auxtether electrification is @xmath37 . requiring @xmath38",
    "we can solve for @xmath36 .",
    "using above definitions , the result can be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the orbital angular frequency at @xmath41 : @xmath42 .",
    "for example for the baseline 1 n e - sail orbiting at 1 au @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath41 , @xmath45 s@xmath46 , @xmath47 kg , and @xmath48 nn / m so that @xmath49 .",
    "this is a conveniently small fraction of the full circle , hence there is typically an abundant performance margin that can be used e.g.  for running the auxtethers at reduced voltage or for having only part of the auxtether being conductive .",
    "in many missions the orbital coriolis effect causes a secular variation of the e - sail spin rate which must be compensated by technical means .",
    "we showed conceptually that this can be effected by making the auxtethers partly or completely from conducting material and having a way to control their voltages .",
    "the resulting pure e - sail concept does not need any auxiliary propulsion systems such as cold gas thrusters , feep thrusters or photonic blades for its long - term spin rate management .    in the future , more refined engineering studies should be carried out concerning conducting auxtether designs and the voltage regulation mechanisms of the auxtethers .",
    "one should also study the details of how the proposed scheme can be used for angular momentum generation during tether deployment .",
