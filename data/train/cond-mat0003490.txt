    "recently , much attention has been paid to the investigations of systems consisting of two weakly interacting bose - einstein condensates [ 1 - 17 ] due to the appearance of quantum interference [ 18 - 34 ] and new macroscopic quantum phenomena [ 35 - 37 ] . in principle , such condensate systems can be produced in a double trap with two condensates coupled by quantum tunneling and ground collisions , or in a system with two different magnetic sublevels of an atom , in which case the two species condensates correspond two electronic states involved .",
    "the coupling between two condensates could be realized by the near - resonant dipole - dipole interaction .    the first experiment [ 6 ] involving interactions between two condensates was performed with atoms evaporatively cooled in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin states of @xmath2 .",
    "one of the latest experimental advances [ 3,7 ] in this direction is the realization of measurements of relative phase in two - component bose - einstein condensates . in experiments at jila [ 3 ] , two condensates in two different internal atomic states",
    "are produced by using a single two - photon coupling pulse .",
    "the two condensates have a well defined relative phase . after a time during which the condensates evolve in the trapping potentials , the two condensates interfere through mixing coherently the two internal atomic states .",
    "then , the relative phase of the two condensates is obtained from the spatial interference pattern .",
    "the realization of measurements of the relative phase between two condensates opened the fascinating possibility of experimentally examing the phase - related phenomena in bose condensates , such as atomic josephson effect and macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) [ 37 ] .",
    "theoretical studies of such systems began in ho and shenoy s work [ 9 ] which shown that binary mixtures of condensates of alkali atoms have a great variety of ground state and vortex structures .",
    "then , the stability and collective excitations of two - species condensate systems [ 1,2,4,5 ] have been extensively studied .",
    "more recently , smerzi and coworkers [ 37 ] have shown that the in a system of two bose condensates the quantum coherent atomic tunneling between two condensates induces two types of interesting effects .",
    "one is an atomic josephson effect in bose condensates , which [ 43 ] is a generalization of the sinusoidal josephson effects familiar in superconductors .",
    "the other is macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) , which is a kind of a self - locked population imbalance between two bose condensates .",
    "it arises because of the interatomic nonlinear self - interaction .",
    "the mqst has a quantum nature , involving the coherence of a macroscopic number of atoms in the two condensates .",
    "it has been known that the mqst depends upon the trap parameters , the total atoms and initial states of the system and is self - maintained in a closed conserved system without external drives . as pointed out in ref.[37 ] , it is easier to observe the mqst in bose condensates than self - trapping phenomena in other systems , such as the single - electron coulomb blockade effect [ 38 ] arising from the coulomb interaction between electrons , single polaron trapping in a medium [ 39 ] which arises from single electrons , interacting with a polarizable lattice , and external gravitational effects on he ii baths [ 40,41 ] .    in ref.[37 ] , smerzi and coworkers only considered the mqst induced by interatomic nonlinear self - interaction in each condensate . however , in a system consisting of two bose condensates , there are not only nonlinear self - interaction but also interspecies nonlinear interaction .",
    "questions that naturally arise are , what is the effect of the interspecies nonlinear interaction on the mqst and quantum coherent atomic tunneling ? does interspecies nonlinear interaction strengthen or weaken the mqst and the atomic tunneling current between them ?    in this paper , we present a theoretical treatment of the mqst and the quantum coherent atomic tunneling in a more general two - species bose condensate system in terms of a two - mode approximate model and the rotating wave approximation .",
    "our treatment involves not only the interatomic nonlinear self - interaction in each species but also the interspecies nonlinear interaction .",
    "we find that the presence of the interspecies nonlinear interaction gives rise to new insight to the mqst and the atomic tunneling between the two condensates . this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii , we establish our model and present an approximate analytic solution . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the collapse and revival ( cr ) phenomenon on population imbalance between two condensates . in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the mqst in the two - condensate system , and discuss the dependence of the mqst upon the initial states and the tunneling interaction and the nonlinear interactions . in sec .",
    "v , we study quantum dynamics of the atomic tunneling current and its @xmath3 characteristics . we shall conclude our paper with discussions and remarks in the last section .",
    "we consider a zero - temperature two - species bose condensate system in which the atoms interact via @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 elastic collisions , and there is a josephson - like coupling term denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the formalism of the second quantization , hamiltonian of such a system",

    "the mode expansion of the condensate function over single - particle states ( 6 ) makes the condensate shape not to be changed , this limits migration of condensed atoms from one condensate to the other .",
    "the constraint on the shapes of condensates implies that the two - mode approximation can be applied only for weak nonlinearity .",
    "the valid conditions of the two - mode approximation were demonstrated in refs.[30 , 32,35 ] , which indicate that this approximation provides a reasonably accurate picture for weak many - body interactions , i.e. , for small number of condensed atoms . for large condensates , the mode functions of condensates are altered due to the collisional interactions , and the two - mode approximation breaks down . as shown in ref.[30,32 ] , a simple estimate shows that this happens when the number of atoms @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a typical scattering length and @xmath38 is a measure of the trap size .",
    "if we consider a large trap with the size @xmath39 m and the typical scattering length @xmath40 nm , the two - mode approximation is applicable for @xmath41 .",
    "this is the case which we consider here .",
    "we shall show that the mqst and atomic tunneling between the two condensates are strongly affected by the nonlinear many - body interactions .",
    "we note that the two - mode approximate hamiltonian has the same form with that of a two - mode nonlinear optical directional coupler [ 42 ] .",
    "the two - mode hamiltonian ( 7 ) can not be exactly solved , but for weak nonlinear interactions a closed analytical solution can be obtained under the rotating wave approximation suggested by alodjanc _",
    "[ 43 ] .    in order to obtain an approximate analytic solution of the hamiltonian ( 7 )",
    ", we introduce a new pair of bosonic operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 by the following expressions : : @xmath44 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are slowly varying operators , they satisfy the usual bosonic commutation relations : @xmath45=0 $ ] , and @xmath46=\\delta_{ij}$ ] with @xmath47 being the hermitain conjugation of @xmath48",

    "the account of the fast oscillating term results only in some addtional oscillations which play no essential role in the evolution of the measurable quantities specifying the macroscopic quantum phenomena of the two - condensate system , so that it is fully negligible .",
    "this means the rotating wave approximation [ 43 ] . after neglecting the nonresonant term @xmath56",

    "obviously , @xmath63 is diagonal in the fock space of @xmath58 , and we find that @xmath64    consider two coherent states defined in fock spaces of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are displacement operators defined by @xmath67    note the fact that @xmath68 , we can find a useful relation to connect @xmath69 and @xmath70 with each other @xmath71    following the arguments of bose broken symmetry , we assume that the two condensates are initially in the coherent states @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are eigenstates of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "then the wave function of the two species condensate system at time @xmath76 can be explicitly expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 where we have used eqs.(25 ) , ( 26 ) in the derivation of eq.(27 ) .",
    "in this section we show that the two condensate system under our consideration exhibits a collapse and revival phenomenon of population imbalance between two condensates . denote the number difference of atoms between the two condensates by @xmath79 then from eq.(27 ) we can find that at time @xmath76 , the number of atoms in each condensate @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times e^{-2n\\sin^2\\frac{1}{2}(q-\\chi)t}\\ } ,   ( i=1,2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the following symbols : @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 being defined by @xmath85 then , the population difference is given by @xmath86 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times e^{-2n\\sin^2(\\frac{1}{2}(q-\\chi)t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the total number of the atoms in the two condensates .",
    "eq.(35 ) indicates that the population imbalance periodically oscillates with the time evolution . from eq.(35 ) we can see that @xmath88 exhibits collapse and revival phenomenon which is a kind of nonclassical effect well known in the jaynes - cummings model [ 44 ] to describe interaction between a single - mode radiation field and a two - level atom .",
    "the cr is also found in a bose condensate system [ 35,36 ] . from eq.(35 ) we see that the cr of the population imbalance in the two - condensate system depends on the tunneling interaction ( @xmath89 ) and interatomic nonlinear interactions ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) . when @xmath92 , since the function @xmath93 $ ] is the rapidly varying part in ( 35 ) , so that the shape of the cr is determined by the envelope function @xmath94 $ ] .",

    "1 clearly indicates the cr phenomenon of the population difference .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that when @xmath101 , the population difference ( 35 ) becomes @xmath102,\\ ] ] which is a simple sinusoidal oscillation , no cr occurs .",
    "the suppression of the cr can be explained by looking at the expression ( 35 ) which indicates that both the self - interaction ( @xmath90 ) and the interspecies interaction ( @xmath91 ) can induce the cr , but the cr produced by one can weaken that by another .",
    "it is the cr produced by the self - interaction completely counteracts the cr by the interspecies interaction that leads to the suppression of the cr .    when there is no nonlinear interactions , i.e. , @xmath103 , from eq.(35 ) it is easy to find that the population imbalance has the same form with that of the case @xmath104 .",
    "this means that the cr vanishes when the nonlinearity vanishes .",

    "when there exists the tunneling coupling , i.e. , @xmath115 , from eq.(40 ) we can find the critical value of the tunneling coupling at which the mqst happens @xmath116 .",
    "this critical value @xmath117 depends upon only the difference between the nonlinear self - interaction and interspecies nonlinear interaction , not the nonlinear self - interaction and interspecies nonlinear interaction themselves .",
    "therefore , it becomes possible that the mqst occurs only when the tunneling coupling equals or exceeds the critical value @xmath117 .    in fig.2",

    "if we consider only the influence of the tunneling coupling while the interatomic nonlinear interactions are not involved , i.e. , @xmath115 , @xmath103 , we find that @xmath178.\\ ] ] this atomic tunneling current is a pure sinusoidally alternating atomic current with the period @xmath179 . without @xmath3 component .",
    "hence no shapiro - like steps appears .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the interatomic nonlinear interactions are involved , but @xmath104 , we get the same results with those of the case of @xmath103 for the atomic tunneling current and the shapiro - like steps .",
    "this indicates that the contributions of the nonlinear self - interaction ( @xmath90 ) in each condensate to the atomic tunneling can counteract that of the interspecies nonlinear interactions ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is the competition between the nonlinear self - interaction and the interspecies nonlinear interaction that leads to a simple form of the atomic tunneling current and the suppression of the shapiro - like steps .",
    "in particular , we note that when @xmath113 , i.e. , there is no tunneling coupling , and @xmath146 , we find that @xmath180,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 is given by eq.(32 ) . in fig .",
    "4 , we display the time evolution of the atomic tunneling current ( 64 ) when the tunneling coupling vanishes .",
    "results are shown for the case of @xmath173 when the two condensates are in the initial state with @xmath182 and @xmath183 . from fig.4",
    "we see that the evolution of the atomic tunneling current exhibits the cr phenomenon .",
    "eq.(64 ) implies that the atomic tunneling current is nonzero , but no the shapiro - like steps appears . from eq.(64 ) we can see that even though there is no the tunneling coupling between the two condensates @xmath184 , the atomic tunneling between the two condensates may happen .",
    "this atomic tunneling is completely induced by the nonlinearity of interatomic interactions which are characterized by interatomic collisions ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the nonlinearity of interatomic interactions in the two condensates can lead to the atomic tunneling between the two condensates .",
    "we have studied the mqst and the quantum coherent atomic tunneling in a two species bose condensate system in the presence of nonlinear self - interaction of each species , the interspecies nonlinear interaction , and the josephson - like tunneling interaction , and have given new insight to the mqst and the atomic tunneling .",
    "we have shown that the interatomic nonlinear interactions in the two condensates induce not only the mqst but also the cr of the population difference between two condensates , the cr phenomenon can be considered as a novel macroscopic quantum effect .",
    "we have indicated that the nonlinear interactions significantly affect the atomic tunneling , and the shapiro - like steps of the atomic tunneling current . comparing with smerzi and coworkers work [ 37 ] ,",
    "the present work involves the interspecies nonlinear interaction .",
    "the involvement of the interspecies nonlinear interaction gives rise to new characteristics on the mqst and the atomic tunneling .",
    "we have shown that when both the nonlinear self - interaction @xmath185 and the interspecies nonlinear interaction @xmath186 present at the same time , the atomic tunneling dynamics and the mqst and the shapiro - like steps depends upon the difference @xmath187 , not @xmath90 and @xmath91 themselves .",
    "we have also found that the interspecies nonlinear interaction generates the mqst at the same level with nonlinear self - interaction",
    ". however , contribution from the interspecies interaction to the mqst and that from the self - interaction weaken themselves with each other .",
    "it is the competing effects between the nonlinear self - interaction in each species and the interspecies nonlinear interaction that leads to the quenching of the mqst and the suppression of the cr and the shapiro - like steps of the atomic tunneling current .",
    "especially , we have revealed that the nonlinearity of interatomic interactions in the two condensates can induce the coherent atomic tunneling between two condensates occurs , even though there does not exist the josephson - like tunneling coupling .",
    "it should be mentioned that these results are obtained under the two - mode approximation and the rotating wave approximation , so they are valid for weak nonlinear interactions between atoms .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in order to observe macroscopic quantum phenomena such as mqst and shapiro - like steps in bose condensates , one has to control various interactions between atoms .",
    "this controlling can be carried out through manipulating interatomic scattering lengthes .",
    "several theoretical and experimental approaches [ 46 - 51 ] to alter the scattering length have been proposed . in particular , recent experiments on feshbach resonances in a bose condensate [ 46,47 ]",
    "have indicated that the scattering length of ultracold atoms can be altered through feshbach resonance .",
    "these experimental progresses provide the possibility to observe the mqst and shapiro - like steps in bose condensates .",
