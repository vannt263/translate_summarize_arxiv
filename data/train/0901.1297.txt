    "massive early type stars ( o- , early b- , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ) are hot ( @xmath0  k ) , and possess some of the strongest sustained winds among galactic objects . among the massive early - type stars , wr - stars have the highest mass loss rate @xmath1yr . winds of massive stars are generally supersonic , reaching terminal velocities of typically @xmath2  km / s @xcite .",
    "their kinetic energy , @xmath3 , however , rarely exceed 1% of the bolometric radiative energy output of typically @xmath4  erg / s .",
    "when two such stars form a system , their winds collide , creating an interaction region of high temperature ( @xmath5k ) shocked gas .",
    "the position of this collision region is determined by ram pressure balance , and two ( reverse ) shocks follow where fermi acceleration has been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "convincing observational evidence for particle acceleration to relativistic energies mediated by their supersonic winds comes from the detection of non - thermal radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this component has been interpreted as synchrotron emission on the basis of the measured spectra ( softer than the canonical value @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and high brightness temperatures of @xmath8k , and serves also as a proof for the existence of magnetic fields in the shock environment .",
    "these findings triggered the development of theoretical models of non - thermal photon production in the shock region which is exposed to a strong radiation field in the uv range and high wind particle densities from the participating hot stars , and their magnetic fields .",
    "in these scenarios non - thermal high - energy emission from the shock region , extending well into the @xmath9-ray domain , has been predicted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "generally , @xmath9-rays are produced either by inelastic nucleon - nucleon interactions if the cosmic ray nucleons reach sufficient high energies to overcome the threshold of this process , or are produced through leptonic processes like inverse compton scattering and non - thermal bremsstrahlung . typically , inverse compton produced fluxes are found to dominate over bremsstrahlung produced ones here .",
    "for close binary systems it has also been proposed that nucleons are accelerated in the shock up to eev energies , with subsequent photodissociation reactions and/or photomeson production ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , x - ray imaging with chandra revealed an extended region at the location of ram pressure balance , and was interpreted as the wind - wind collision zone @xcite .",
    "however , despite a multitude of observations dedicated towards this object , as well as its relatively short distance to earth , the geometry of this system is not well known .",
    "the unknowns start with wr  147 s period , being at least 1350 years @xcite , the lack of clues about its argument of periastron , and the yet pending observational hints towards a determination of its orbital eccentricity . proposed inclination angles , mainly deduced from modeling of the extended radio and x - ray images , cover a wide range : from `` low '' ( @xmath16 : * ? ? ?",

    "we will use 650  pc as wr  147 s distance in the following . although the binary nature of this system was already proposed in 1990 @xcite ,",
    "it was not generally accepted until high - resolution images undoubtedly established the existence of a weak wolf - rayet companion of type wn8(h ) to the main sequence star b0.5 v. in particular , wr  147 is meanwhile resolved into its components in the radio band by merlin ( 1.6  ghz , 5  ghz ) @xcite , vla @xcite , ukirt k - band and hst - wfpc2 @xcite optical imaging .",
    "notable is the dominance of the non - thermal component , interpreted as synchrotron radiation , between the thermal components of the stars , which points towards a colliding wind scenario operating in this system .",
    "high - resolution x - ray observations @xcite revealed an extended emission region with its centroid located in agreement with the location of the bow shock between the stars .",

    "setia gunawan ( 2001 ) then used a wind - momentum ratio ( of @xmath36 ) to conclude on the mass - loss of the main sequence companian : @xmath37yr@xmath13 for @xmath38  km / s .",
    "on the basis of the binary separation wr  147 has to be classified as an extremely long period binary @xcite , yet it s precise period is still unmeasured .",
    "a lower limit of 1350  yrs was derived by setia gunawan ( 2001 ) .",
    "no values for the eccentricity of wr  147 are documented in the literature so far .    although attempts have been undertaken to estimate the inclination of this system , the implied range of values for this quantity is broad : fitting the extended image of the non - thermal radio component to a bow shock model gave values of @xmath39 ( vla : * ? ? ?",

    "practically , this means that the inclination of wr  147 is at least highly uncertain .",
    "modeling the extended chandra image required an inclination angle of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we will use this quantity in this work as a free parameter , in an attempt to constrain its value from observational limits on the non - thermal high energy component of wr  147 .    at present , only the radio band observations provided signatures of a non - thermal particle population in massive star systems , and data have been obtained in a number of measurements .",
    "we use the summary table from setia gunawan ( 2001 ) for the purpose of this work . after extracting the thermal component from the total measured one ,",

    "this corresponds to an @xmath46 power law particle spectrum extending beyond a few @xmath47  mev for mgauss magnetic field strengths .",
    "flux variations in the light curve of wr  147 have been reported occasionally @xcite , however , could not be confirmed @xcite .",
    "instead , any flux variability has rather been found to occur on long time scales with variability amplitudes not in excess of @xmath48 @xcite , possibly indicating wind clumping .",
    "the present work utilizes the colliding wind model of reimer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    "the supersonic winds of a massive main sequence star and its companion flow radially from each star until they collide to form a region of shocked , hot gas where their ram pressure balances , separated by a contact discontinuity with a forward and reverse shock .",
    "it is this shock region where particles may be accelerated out of the pool of thermal wind particles with acceleration rate @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 the corresponding diffusion coefficient , @xmath51 the shock velocity and @xmath52 the shock compression ) by the fermi mechanism @xcite . behind the shock the gas expands sideways from the wind collision region along the contact surface with a convection velocity @xmath53 being a fraction ( set to 0.5 here ;",

    "* ) of the wind velocity at the stagnation point .",
    "both , diffusion and convection by the stellar winds operate in the collision region with diffusion being dominant close to the stagnation point ( named `` acceleration region '' in the following ) , and convection determining the particles transport further away from the downstream region ( called the `` convection region '' ) . for simplicity the geometry of the collision region , being the site of the non - thermal radiation component , is adopted as cylinder - like .",
    "this is a sensible approximation specifically for high energy particles , the focus of this work , since most relativistic particles will have lost already a significant amount of their original energy when entering the convection region .",
    "the location of the shock front with respect to the main sequence ob star , @xmath54 , is determined by the balance of the ram pressure of both winds that have generally reached their terminal velocities ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) in long - period binary systems : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 the separation of the binaries , @xmath60 , @xmath61 the mass loss rates of the wn- and ob - star , respectively .    for a given stellar surface magnetic field",

    "( 2006 ) we used @xmath66  g for wr  147 which leads to approximative equipartition field values at the shock location .",

    "is described by the angles @xmath72 with @xmath73 , and @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "the emitting electron spectra are calculated self - consistently by solving the steady state diffusion - loss equation and including wind expansion and all relevant radiative losses ( synchrotron , ic and losses due to coulomb scattering and relativistic bremsstrahlung ) which balance the acceleration gains .",
    "ic losses often extend into the klein - nishina regime , which requires a rigorous treatment of this dominating loss process . in consequence ,",
    "klein - nishina loss dominated electron spectra cutoff at higher energies as compared to electron spectra that are treated with the thomson approximation throughout the whole particle energy range . in the convection region the particles loose energy radiatively as well as through expansion losses while in the post - shock flow .",
    "this leads to a dilution of the particle density and to a deficit of high energy particles in this region . because the stellar target photons for ic scattering arrive at the collision region from a prefered direction , the full angular dependence of the cross section has to be taken into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radiation yield of ic scattering depends on the scattering angle @xmath76 ( angle between the directions of the incoming ( from the ob - star ) and outgoing photons ) , which obviously depends on the location of the scattering electron as well as the orbital phase .",
    "it is @xmath77 this leads to anisotropy effects : the cutoff energy and flux variations of the ic luminosity are dependent on the line of sight into the wind as large scattering angles tend to produce more energetic photons than small scattering angles .",
    "a detailed description can be found in reimer et al .",
    "the emission model of reimer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for modeling a binary system of known geometry ( orbital phase , eccentricity @xmath78 , and period - or binary separation , the argument of periastron , and the inclination angle @xmath23 with respect to the plane of the sky ) possess five free parameters : main sequence star surface magnetic field , diffusion coefficient @xmath50 , shock compression factor @xmath52 , convection velocity @xmath53 and normalization of the injected particle population . these are contrasted by various physical and observational constraints : in order to accelerate particles to the observed relativistic energies the diffusion coefficient must be low enough to allow acceleration to overcome the coulomb losses . at the same time , the bohm - limit for the diffusion coefficient shall not be violated . a further observational limit",
    "may be imposed by the observed maximum photon energy of any non - thermal component . from the highest observed frequency data point of the synchrotron component of wr  147 , 43  ghz",
    ", we deduce the maximum electron lorentz factor @xmath79 to be at least or greater than several @xmath80 for mgauss magnetic field strengths assuming roughly equipartition . to reach those energies diffusion must be at least as efficient as @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86@xmath87 s@xmath13 for system inclinations @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath66 g ) , respectively , and serve therefore as upper limits for @xmath90 .",
    "these limits take into account the shift of the shock location away from the ob - star with growing binary separation for increasing inclination angles ( @xmath91 ) , and the corresponding dilution of the photon density there .",
    "the electron spectra would then cut off due to radiative losses .",
    "the highest electron energy is attained by decreasing the diffusion time scale up to the bohm limit .",
    "this limit depends again on the system inclination @xmath23 for an increasing binary separation and shock distance to the ob - star , and hence a decreasing field strength at the shock location , with rising @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding cutoff energies lie , within a factor 2 - 3 , around several @xmath92  mev ( @xmath66  g@xmath93  g ) .",
    "the narrowness of this range justifies the use of a fixed diffusion coefficient for all inclination angles without much loss of constraining power . in the following we therefore use @xmath94@xmath87 s@xmath13 ( @xmath66 g ) or @xmath95@xmath87 s@xmath13 ( @xmath96 g ) , independent of the system inclination .",
    "we note that any value @xmath97  g , together with the here assumed rotator theory , is in agreement with the lower limits for the field strength derived from the razin - tsytovich effect .",
    "the particle spectra normalization is limited by energy conservation and particle number conservation : the total energy in form of relativistic particles shall not be larger than the available total kinetic wind energy of the system , and the number of relativistic particles injected into the system must not exceed the number of wind particles entering the acceleration zone . the final normalization is then fixed within these limits by the requirement to reproduce the observed synchrotron spectrum , and is therefore dependent on the chosen magnetic field strength .    with these constraints and limits at hands we will in the following explore the effects of varying the system geometry upon the expected ic radiation at high energies .",
    "this will then allow us to compare our studied geometries with the observational data , and set constraints on the orbital parameters in the wr  147 system .",
    "the excellent radio images gave a projected binary separation of @xmath98  au for a distance of 650  pc .",

    "since the corresponding cross section is dependent on the interaction angle , the expected attenuation therefore relies on the system geometry , most important , on the distance of the shock location with respect to the main sequence star . for wr  147 , being an extremely long - period binary with a presumably small eccentricity , the photospheric uv radiation field at the location of the collision region is found low enough ( @xmath146 @xmath147 ) to allow here the neglect of @xmath9-ray absorption due to photon - photon collisions . the value of @xmath148 is not exceeded in any of the considered cases , corresponding to a flux throughput of at least 98% for wr  147 .",
    "despite its close proximity the system geometry ( including inclination , period , eccentricity ) of the very - long period binary wr  147 is yet not well known .",
    "it belongs to a group of massive binary systems whose radio emission shows a non - thermal component . from radio",
    "imaging the location of this component has been associated with the wind collision region , and the projected binary separation is well constrained .",
    "wr  147 is one of the prime candidates for gamma ray production in this collision zone @xcite .",
    "vhe observations with the magic telescope have been made in 2007 for 30.3 hours of good data , which resulted in upper limits at @xmath11  @xmath12 s@xmath13 , @xmath14  @xmath12 s@xmath13 and @xmath15  @xmath12 s@xmath13@xcite .",
    "further observational constraints of wr  147 s non - thermal component are coming from integral upper limits at hard x - rays and the ghz frequency radio synchrotron measurements . in this work we explored the potential of gamma ray measurements to constrain the system geometry by means of an inverse compton model for high energy photon production . for this purpose",
    "we assume a high efficiency of particle acceleration that generally allows the production of gev photons . within this scenario",
    "we find :    * for the chosen rapidness of electron acceleration the particle spectra are cut off due to the size constraint of the acceleration region rather than due to radiative losses . in this case the cutoff energy scales with the magnetic field strength in the acceleration region , and we find the highest cutoff energy for low inclination systems . * the magic upper limits at energies above 80 gev therefore lacks constraining power for large inclinations @xmath149 for wr  147 . *",
    "provided particle acceleration acts sufficiently effective to allow the production of gev photons through inverse compton scattering , then our analysis indicates a preference for wr  147 to possess a large inclination angle .",
    "however , if @xmath23 is small in wr  147 , electron acceleration can not be as efficient as anticipated here .",
    "* increasing the magnetic field strength in the collision region widens the range of parameter values for the wr  147 system geometry . * the synchrotron data from wr  147 imply the existence of @xmath150 mev electrons , and therefore the existence of at least hard x - ray photons produced by those particles .",
    "sensitive hard x - ray / soft gamma ray measurements have therefore the potential to constrain the wr  147 system geometry , independent of the assumed acceleration efficiency . *",
    "gamma ray attenuation for this very - long period binary system is not anticipated to cause distinctive observational signatures in the high energy spectrum .",
    "any phase - locked flux variations at @xmath9-ray energies are therefore likely to be attributed to the anisotropic nature of the ic process .    with a set of eight free parameters ( system inclination and eccentricity , orbital phase and period , ob - star surface magnetic field , diffusion coefficient , shock compression factor and convection velocity ) within the framework of the ic model for high energy photon production ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to be confronted with the observationally constrained quantities ( normalization and spectral index of synchrotron spectrum , projected binary separation , magic and integral upper limits ) it is clear that an in - depth determination of the so far barely known geometry of the wr  147 system must await further information of from measurements of the non - thermal high - energy emission component .",
