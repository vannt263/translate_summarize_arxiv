    "since the late 1960s , clusters of galaxies have been known to be strong x - ray sources where the thermal emission from the intracluster medium ( icm ) produces a diffuse x - ray halo .",
    "the icm is diffuse ( central electron density of @xmath3@xmath4 ) with typical temperature @xmath5 to @xmath6k . in the 1970s ,",
    "similarly diffuse radio emission was found in the coma cluster .",
    "this radio emission was found to have a steep power law index ( @xmath7 for @xmath8 ) which indicates a non - thermal origin . despite efforts to detect similar radio haloes in other clusters , until recently few",
    "were found with diffuse radio emission ( see review by feretti & giovannini 1996 ) .",
    "this led to the belief that radio haloes are rare .",
    "however , the number of clusters found to have diffuse radio emission has more than doubled over the last couple of years , mainly because of the availability of moderate brightness sensitivity surveys at 1.4ghz , e.g. the nvss @xcite , as well as high brightness sensitivity observations of hot clusters to detect the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( e.g. herbig & birkinshaw 1994 ; liang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "diffuse cluster radio emission is now divided into two distinct classes : haloes and relics .",
    "haloes permeate the entire cluster and resemble the thermal x - ray emission , but relics are on the cluster periphery .",
    "both haloes and relics exhibit steep spectral indices ( @xmath7 ) and are extended over @xmath9mpc with the haloes having lower surface brightness . emission from radio relics is strongly polarised ( up to @xmath10% ) but no polarised emission has been detected in radio haloes .",
    "radio haloes and relics are believed to emit by the synchrotron process .",
    "the non - detection of polarised emission from radio haloes is attributed to low surface brightness and to faraday depolarisation effects due to the mixing of thermal and relativistic plasma , especially towards the cluster centres .",
    "however , synchrotron emission from haloes requires a population of relativistic ( gev energy range ) electrons and a cluster - wide magnetic field .",
    "the origins of both particles and field have been a subject of much debate since the late 1970s ( e.g. jaffe 1977 ; dennison 1980 ; roland 1981 ) .",
    "recent evidence on this question has come through the observation that radio haloes are preferentially found in high x - ray luminosity clusters ( giovannini et al .",
    "1999 ) , and that there may be a steep correlation between the radio power of haloes and the icm temperature ( e.g. liang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "no upper limits so far contradict this correlation in the temperature range 515kev ( liang 2000 ) .",
    "the relativistic particles can not simply leak out of radio sources in the cluster , because the diffusion path length ( @xmath11kpc assuming alfvn speed propagation ) is short compared to the size of clusters ( @xmath12mpc ) .",
    "giovannini & feretti ( 2000 ) found that while diffuse radio sources were found in bright x - ray clusters , none of the 11 clusters selected for the presence of a tailed radio source within the central 300kpc showed any diffuse radio emission .",
    "the presence of diffuse radio emission is therefore more closely connected with the properties of the thermal plasma in the icm than the presence of tailed radio sources which were thought to provide relativistic particles .",
    "this gives observational evidence that particles escaping from radio sources in the cluster are unlikely to be accelerated to the relativistic energies required for the radio halo emission .",
    "instead , we interpret the correlation between halo radio power and icm temperature , and the similarity in appearance of the x - ray and radio haloes , as showing that the relativistic electrons may be accelerated from the thermal pool . the direct cause of this acceleration may be the merging of subclusters and turbulence in the icm ( e.g. tribble 1993 , brunetti et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the idea that the same relativistic electrons generate radio emission through their synchrotron losses and x - ray or gamma - ray emission by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering was first used by felten and morrison ( 1966 ) for the interpretation of the galactic diffuse emission . later ,",
    "cooke et al . ( 1978 ) used it for the interpretation of the x - ray emission from the lobes of the radio galaxy centaurus a , assuming that the electrons are scattered by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "a similar model was used by rephaeli ( 1979 ) for the interpretation of the hard x - ray emission from the coma cluster : the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio halo emission can scatter the cmb photons up to x - ray energies through ic scattering .",
    "efforts have been made to detect this excess of non - thermal emission above the thermal emission from the hot icm .",
    "it is easiest to detect at hard x - ray energies ( above @xmath13kev ) where the thermal spectrum is expected to cut off exponentially .",
    "recent observations from _ beppo - sax _ have shown that such a hard x - ray excess does exist in some clusters , e.g. coma and a2256 ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "however , alternative theories of the origin of a hard excess have been proposed by various authors .",
    "enlin et al . ( 1999 ) first suggested that the hard x - ray excess observed in the coma cluster may be the result of bremsstrahlung of supra - thermal electrons in the icm accelerated by turbulence .",
    "both enlin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sarazin & kempner ( 2000 ) have assumed the acceleration process works on particles with energies of a few times @xmath14 ( i.e. a few tens of kev ) , and that the electron energy distribution has a sharp transition from a maxwellian to a power law at a few times @xmath14 .",
    "dogiel ( 2000 ) pointed out that the acceleration of particles is only efficient above @xmath15kev ( i.e. the power law distribution starts at @xmath15kev ) , but the distortion of the maxwellian is already significant at much lower energies ( as low as @xmath16kev ) due to the flux of thermal particles running away into the region of acceleration ( for details see gurevich 1960 ) .",
    "it is the ` quasi - thermal ' particles just above @xmath16kev that produce the observed hard x - ray excess through bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "however , our analysis of the _ in situ _ acceleration model given below ( sec .",
    "6 ) shows that the spectrum of mhd turbulence needed to produce the radio emitting electrons is very steep which may make this model problematic .    on the other hand , a model where the x - ray and radio emitting particles are generated by electrons from an ` external ' injected population",
    "can not be ruled out . a possible model could be that particles in the intracluster medium are accelerated only in regions with high level of turbulence , for example near collisionless bow shocks generated by motions of hypothetical dark matter haloes ( e.g. , bykov et al . 2000b ) .",
    "radio observations have not shown significant spatial fluctuations of intensity in radio haloes ( e.g. giovannini et al .",
    "1993 , liang et al .",
    "2000 ) which means that we must have either _ in situ _ acceleration of these electrons everywhere in the intracluster medium or injection by numerous sources whose separation is smaller than the path length of the electrons ( @xmath17kpc ) or the length corresponding to the resolution of the radio maps . in the case of the coma cluster which is relatively bright and close by",
    ", the highest resolution vla map of the radio halo corresponds to a length scale similar to the diffusion path length of the elecrons .",
    "therefore , the injection model requires a high density of localised ` external ' sources .    below we investigate both the local and global acceleration models and determine formally the model parameters required to fit the whole observed spectrum from radio to x - rays for the coma cluster , since this is the best - studied cluster in all wave - bands .",
    "our analysis is performed in the framework of a model where spatial variations of the model parameters are neglected .",
    "there are several reasons for this : a ) observations show more or less uniform distribution of non - thermal emission in the halo ; and b ) we do not have enough information about spatial variations of the hard x - ray flux from the coma halo , therefore we derive averaged parameters of particle acceleration based on the total flux of hard x - rays .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted are @xmath18kms@xmath19mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 , so that for the coma cluster 1 arcmin is 40kpc .",
    "extensive data from radio to x - ray bands exist for the coma cluster ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "coma - c was the first radio halo detected , and its emission has been measured between 30mhz and 4850mhz ( deiss et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the spectrum is consistent with a power law of index @xmath37 between 30 and 1400mhz .",
    "the measurement at 4850mhz is an upper limit and the apparent steepening at 2700mhz has been contested ( deiss et al .",
    "radio spectral index measurements for such diffuse sources are difficult and a mismatch of the beam size or difference in the brightness sensitivity of the observations can often lead to an apparent steepening of the spectral index . accordingly , we will disregard the measurements above 1400mhz .",
    "the largest extent of the radio halo was found to be @xmath38 on an effelsberg map at 1.4ghz ( deiss et al .",
    "1997 ) ; by contrast , the 1.4ghz vla image which is not as sensitive to the large scale emission showed a maximum extent of only @xmath39 ( kim et al .",
    "in most circumstances , the main source of charged particle acceleration in a cosmic plasma is collisions of electrons and ions with magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "this leads to a slow , stochastic , energy gain . here",
    "we consider magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence in the strong and weak limits .",
    "we can determine which regime is most appropriate in clusters from the spectral indices of radio haloes , since the spectral signatures of the two cases differ .",
    "if the magnetic turbulence is ` weak ' , i.e. the amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations , @xmath40 , is much less than the strength of the large scale magnetic field @xmath41 , @xmath42 , then the interaction between the particles and the fluctuations has a resonance character , which has been discussed in the context of the interstellar medium ( berezinskii et al .",
    "the resonance condition is @xmath43 where the different signs correspond to the different wave polarisations , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the wave - number and the wave frequency respectively , @xmath46 is the component of the particle velocity along the magnetic field , and @xmath47 is the gyro - frequency of a particle with the total energy @xmath48 and the charge @xmath49",
    "@xmath50    the resonance condition ( eq .  [ reson ] ) can be written in the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the particle velocity , and @xmath53 is the cosine of the particle pitch angle ( i.e. the angle between the particle momentum , @xmath54 , and the large scale magnetic field , @xmath41 ) .",

    "we see that in general electrons and protons of the same energy ( especially for non - relativistic energies ) are scattered by waves with different wavelength and polarisation .",
    "therefore , in some conditions electrons may be preferentially accelerated .",
    "this may be the case in the coma halo ; and in this respect models of hard x - ray emission from coma which take into account of only the electron acceleration are not implausible ( e.g. schlickeiser et al .",
    "1987 ) .    the process of acceleration may be described as momentum diffusion with a diffusion coefficient determined by the spectrum of magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "if the spectrum of waves is a power - law @xmath60 the momentum diffusion coefficient depends on the particle momentum as ( berezinskii et al . 1990 ) @xmath61    it can be shown that in the simple thick target model the momentum distribution of accelerated particles is given by ( see gurevich 1960 ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the electron number density distribution per momentum volume interval , so that the total number of particles above a momentum @xmath54 is given by @xmath64 and the value of the index @xmath65 can be deduced from the spectrum of non - thermal emission produced by the accelerated electrons .    below ( sec .",
    "6 ) we perform the necessary analysis in an attempt to estimate @xmath66 and @xmath65 and hence to define the mechanism of particle acceleration in the intracluster medium of the coma cluster .      in the case of strong magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence , where the field fluctuations are of the same order as the mean field , both plasma components , positive and negative , are accelerated .",
    "this is seen , for example , in the acceleration of particles in molecular clouds ( dogiel et al .",
    "1987 ) or acceleration by supersonic turbulence , which effectively acts as an ensemble of shock waves ( bykov and toptygin 1993 ) .",
    "stochastic acceleration by strong turbulence is described as momentum diffusion with diffusion coefficient @xmath67 of the form ( e.g. toptygin 1985 ) @xmath68 which creates a relatively flat spectrum of accelerated particles @xmath69 the interpretation of the hard x - ray emission in coma in terms of this kind of acceleration was discussed by dogiel ( 2000 ) .",
    "a similar acceleration process takes place near shock fronts , where the magnetic field strength jumps by an amount of the order of the mean field .",

    "it is interesting to note that , for @xmath169 , ic starts to dominate over bremsstrahlung in the hard x - ray regime , but for @xmath170 bremsstrahlung dominates again because synchrotron and ic losses exceed the gains from acceleration and causes the electron spectrum to cut off at @xmath9gev . to produce x - ray emission above 20kev through ic scattering of the cmb , we need electrons with energies above @xmath171gev .",
    "for example , if the radiating particles are accelerated by strong turbulence , that is @xmath172 ( hence @xmath173 to fit the hard x - ray data assuming a bremsstrahlung origin ) , then ionisation losses dominate over acceleration below 1mev ( see fig .  [ loss ] ) . the gain from acceleration overwhelms particle energy losses in the energy range of 1mev - 1gev .",
    "hence , the maximum energy of accelerated particles is @xmath9gev . at higher energies , the combined synchrotron and ic losses dominates over acceleration ( see fig .",
    "[ loss ] ) , hence strong turbulence is unable to produce radio emitting gev electrons .",
    "acceleration by strong turbulence can produce only relatively low energy electrons emitting in the energy range of hard x - rays to soft gamma - rays through bremsstrahlung .",
    "another mechanism for the production of radio - emitting electrons is then necessary to explain the radio halo in coma .",
    "this conclusion is somewhat in contradiction with the results of dogiel ( 2000 ) who showed that in this case strong turbulence can accelerate particles up to energies of @xmath17 gev , albeit with a much flatter spectrum than needed to produce the observed radio spectrum .",
    "the reason for this disagreement is that dogiel ( 2000 ) used the density for central regions of the cluster , where the frequency of thermal particle collisions is high .",
    "this led to a higher acceleration efficiency than in our present treatment which uses average cluster parameters .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ loss ] that for @xmath174 , the synchrotron and ic losses win over the acceleration term at energies even lower than 1gev .",
    "this explains why blasi ( 2000 ) , in his study of stochastic acceleration in the icm assuming a kolmogorov spectrum ( @xmath175 ) concluded that _ in situ _ acceleration could not explain the radio emission because of the synchrotron and ic loss cutoff .",
    "however , we have shown that the value @xmath176 , corresponding to weak turbulence ( sec . 3.2 ) , is consistent with the radio data ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] ) .    in the case of @xmath177 , however , the acceleration term always wins over the loss terms at high energies ( fig .",
    "[ loss ] ) , which means a rapid decrease of the characteristic acceleration time , @xmath178 , with particle momentum @xmath179 and a larger @xmath65 results in a smaller value of the injection energy at which processes of acceleration dominate .",
    "the best fit parameters , @xmath180 and @xmath165 , imply a cluster average @xmath181yrs at the injection energy ( @xmath182kev ) , which means that for @xmath183kev , @xmath178 is much less than the cluster lifetime .",
    "hence , the model is self - consistent in the sense that a ` quasi - stationary ' state can easily be reached within a cluster lifetime .",
    "we note , however , the steep spectrum of turbulence ( @xmath165 ) required for the radio data may pose a problem for the model , since it is known that turbulence with @xmath184 can not effectively scatter particles at pitch angles near @xmath185 in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "nonlinear processes have to be involved to cause effective acceleration(e.g .",
    ", berezinskii et al . 1990 ) . further consideration of this point is beyond the scope of our model .",
    "cluster thermal x - ray and radio structures are similar in morphology ( deiss et al . 1997 , feretti 1999 , liang et al . 2000 , govoni et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this would be expected from the _ in situ _ model .",
    "we can calculate the expected relationship between the radio halo and x - ray profile , if the synchrotron - emitting relativistic particles are drawn from the thermal pool through _ in - situ _ acceleration . if the magnetic field is produced by a dynamo process ( e.g. turbulence ) , then magnetic energy is in equipartition with the energy of turbulent motions ( kraichnan & nagarajan 1967 , de young 1980 ) .",
    "assuming that the energy of turbulence is proportional to the thermal energy , then we have the magnetic energy density in a cluster medium proportional to the thermal energy density @xmath186 , so that @xmath187    as pointed out by enlin et al . ( 1998 ) , this implies that the radio halo surface brightness profile should be slightly steeper than the x - ray profile .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is given by the projection of @xmath188 , which for a @xmath189model with @xmath190 given by eq .",

    "since relativistic particles are accelerated from the thermal pool , we can assume that their density is proportional to the thermal particle density @xmath190 .",
    "then the radio halo brightness profile is given by @xmath192 when using eq .",

    "for the clusters studied by govoni et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the radio and x - ray surface brightness profiles are very similar in shape , implying @xmath7 .",
    "in this section , for clarity we need to distinguish particles from the 3 different energy ranges : thermal , quasi - thermal and non - thermal .",
    "the maxwellian thermal particle spectrum is shaped by coulomb collisions , where each thermal particle collides with other background particles , exchanging energies without changing the shape of the energy spectrum .",
    "the lifetime of the thermal particle distribution is infinite if we neglect thermal bremsstrahlung emission . on the other hand ,",
    "a non - thermal particle spectrum is formed by acceleration processes .",
    "if these particles are injected into a region with no further acceleration , the particles would lose their energy to the background particles through coulomb collisions , thus heating the background plasma and become thermal particles themselves .",
    "the lifetime of non - thermal particles is equal to that of the individual particles . unlike the thermal and non - thermal particles , the quasi - thermal particles exist only in regions of active particle acceleration . like the thermal particles ,",
    "the quasi - thermal ( or suprathermal ) particle distribution is formed by coulomb collisions , but unlike the thermal particle distribution it is not in strict equilibrium ( but in quasi - equilibrium ) and the quasi - thermal particle distribution would dissipate like the non - thermal particles once the acceleration process is switched off .",
    "coulomb collisions cause a net run - away of thermal particles into regions of acceleration in the spectrum , resulting in a spectral distortion with an excess above the thermal equilibrium distribution in the quasi - thermal energy range .",
    "hence the life - time of quasi - thermal particles is shorter than the thermal particles , but longer than the non - thermal particles .",
    "the energy output of emitting particles is determined by their energy losses : ionisation losses ( coulomb collisions with background particles ) for quasi - thermal particles , and inverse compton scattering and synchrotron radiation losses for non - thermal electrons .",
    "the necessary energy output , @xmath195 , can roughly be estimated from the observed value of x - ray luminosity @xmath196 as @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the characteristic time of x - ray emission by parent particles and @xmath199 is the life - time of these particles .    if coma cluster emits x - rays by inverse compton process , then from eq .",
    "[ output ] it follows that @xmath200 where @xmath201erg s@xmath19 is the luminosity of hard ( @xmath202kev ) x - rays from the coma halo .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimate @xmath203 is determined by the unknown rate of synchrotron losses , since the magnetic field strength is only known within fairly wide bounds ( a range that spans nearly 2 orders of magnitude ) .    in the case of a bremsstrahlung origin of the coma luminosity produced by non - thermal particles , as in models of enlin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sarazin & kempner ( 2000 ) , the necessary energy output @xmath203 is much larger than @xmath204 .",
    "the reason is that these non - thermal particles lose their energy by collisions with background electrons and protons ( ionisation losses ) and the probability of their generating a bremsstrahlung photon is very low ( @xmath205 for photons with @xmath206 kev ; valinia and marshall 1998 ) .",
    "therefore the necessary energy output in this case is huge @xmath207 and as pointed out by petrosian ( 2001 ) , this makes the model problematic .",
    "similar problems arise in the interpretation of the hard x - ray flux from the galactic ridge .",
    "the spectrum of hard x - ray emission from the galactic ridge also shows an excess above the thermal flux .",
    "however , in this case its origin can not be interpreted as due to inverse compton of relativistic electrons ( skibo et al .",
    "1996 ) , thermal emission of hot plasma or the integrated contribution of discrete unresolved source ( tanaka 2002 ) .",
    "the only possibility to explain the origin of hard x - ray flux from the galactic disk is just bremsstrahlung radiation of sub - relativistic galactic electrons . if these electrons are non - thermal the necessary energy output should be of the order of @xmath208 erg s@xmath19 , i.e. more than can be supplied by supernovae , the most probable sources of energy in the galaxy ( see e.g. valinia et al . 2000 , and dogiel et al .",
    "it was shown , however by dogiel et al . ( 2002b ) that this energy problem can be resolved if the emission is produced by quasi - thermal electrons .",
    "the life - time of quasi - thermal electrons is longer than that of non - thermal electrons .",
    "therefore , as follows from eq .  [ output ] , the necessary energy output of quasi - thermal electrons is smaller than the energy output of non - thermal electrons .",
    "we showed above that in the case of _ in - situ _ acceleration , unlike the models of enlin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sarazin & kempner ( 2000 ) where non - thermal electrons with power - law spectrum were responsible for the excess hard x - ray in the coma cluster , it is the quasi - thermal electrons with exponential distribution that give rise to the excess hard x - ray emission . if our model is correct , the energy output in quasi - thermal electrons needed to explain the coma x - ray flux is of the order of @xmath209 erg s@xmath19 as follows from numerical calculations for the parameters @xmath210 and @xmath176 , i.e. much less than the estimate in eq .",
    "[ en_nth ] .",
    "the bremsstrahlung x - ray flux can also be generated by sub - relativistic protons ( see dogiel 2001 ) .",
    "though we do not know which specific process is responsible for particle acceleration in coma , we note that in the case of fermi acceleration the characteristic acceleration frequency is proportional to @xmath211 ( see toptigyn ( 1985 ) ) where @xmath52 is the particle velocity and @xmath88 is the particle mean free path ( an average distance between scattering centres ) .",
    "since velocities of thermal electrons are @xmath212 times larger than velocities of thermal protons , we expect that the rate of acceleration for electrons @xmath213 , hence background electrons may be accelerated to sub - relativistic energies more effectively than protons .",
    "as follows from fig .  [ loss ]",
    "the particle spectrum is controlled by ionisation losses at low energies and synchrotron@xmath214ic losses at high energies , which balance the source injection spectrum and acceleration .",
    "if we assume no _ in situ _ acceleration , i.e. @xmath215 in eq .",
    "[ eq_insitu ] , then the kinetic equation for the distribution function @xmath79 can be written as : @xmath216 the stationary solution of this equation is given by @xmath217 i.e. @xmath218 where we assume a power law injection spectrum @xmath219 , or @xmath220 ( where @xmath221 as follows from eq .",
    "[ en ] ) .",
    "the best fit to the radio spectrum gives @xmath222 , or @xmath223 ( figure  [ external ] ) , just as is expected for the model of particle acceleration by strong shocks ( biermann et al .",
    "1993 ) . in this model ,",
    "the origin of the hard x - ray emission is definitely ic with no significant bremsstrahlung ( fig .",
    "[ bric ] ) .",
    "the model reproduces the emission spectrum from hard x - rays to radio if the strength of the magnetic field is less than @xmath224 g .",
    "thus the finding from faraday rotation measurements ( e.g. feretti et al .",
    "1995 ; clarke et al .",
    "2001 ) of cluster fields of a few @xmath53 g argues against the ic model for the hard x - ray ( e.g. enlin et al .",
    "1999 and dogiel 2000 ) .",
    "however , this is not necessarily a problem .",
    "first , since there are only a handful of radio sources behind the cluster with sufficient polarised flux to be detected , the regions of a cluster probed by these sources may not be representative of the average field of the entire cluster .",
    "second , since as many as half of the polarised radio sources used to deduce the cluster magnetic field are cluster members rather than background sources , we expect that such measurements would be biased , as a higher @xmath148-field is likely near a radio source because of its perturbing effect on the icm .",
    "third , feretti et al . (",
    "1995 ) in their study of the tangling scale of the magnetic field in the coma cluster , using an extended polarised radio source in the centre of the cluster , suggested that the cluster magnetic field in coma has a small scale ( @xmath163kpc ) component of strength @xmath225 g as well as a uniform large scale ( @xmath182kpc ) component of strength @xmath226 g which is consistent with the magnetic field of @xmath227 g deduced from the ic model .",
    "figure  [ bric ] shows that for this model ic emission dominates bremsstrahlung at 70kev for the required steep spectral index , @xmath222 .",
    "the presence of strong shocks in galaxy clusters shown by spatial and temperature images from _ rosat _ , _ asca _ and now _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ ( see donnelly et al . 1999 , markevitch et al .",
    "1999 , arnaud et al .",
    "2001 , sun et al .",
    "2001 and boute 2001 ) lends observational support to this model .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to explain both the excess hard x - ray data and the radio halo spectrum with a model where the relativistic electrons are weakly accelerated from the thermal pool by turbulence in the icm . by using a quasi - stationary solution of the kinetic equation , we arrive at an electron energy distribution that deviates from a maxwellian at @xmath16kev and reaches a power law at @xmath154mev . in the process of reaching an equilibrium ,",
    "the collisions between thermal particles produce the supra - thermal electrons at @xmath131kev required to give the excess hard x - ray emission through bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the accelerated gev electrons are then sufficient to produce the observed radio halo spectrum with a magnetic field close to the equipartition value .",
    "the model produces a self - consistent electron energy distribution and has only two free parameters , the acceleration parameter @xmath66 and the momentum spectral index @xmath65 , which are well constrained by the observed excess hard x - ray spectrum and the radio halo spectral index ( fig .",
    "[ aq ] ) . in the hard x - ray energy range ,",
    "the contribution from the inverse compton scattering of the gev electrons is negligible compared with the non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission for steep radio spectral indices @xmath228 .",
    "it is also possible to explain the hard x - ray and radio spectrum by a model where accelerated particles are externally injected in numerous localised regions distributed throughout the cluster . in this case , the contribution from ic scattering dominates that of non - thermal bremsstrahlung in the hard x - ray energy range for steep radio spectral indices .    for both the above models",
    "a strong assumption was made , that the non - thermal x - ray and radio emission from coma is generated from a single electron acceleration mechanism .",
    "an advantage of this assumption is that it limits significantly the number of free parameters in the model .",
    "of course it is possible to have both _ in situ _ acceleration and external injection of accelerated particles ( or global and local acceleration ) at work in the coma cluster .",
    "we have , however , examined the two extremes rather than such a hybrid model .",
    "this study has shown that if it is purely _ in situ _ acceleration that produces the particles necessary for the non - thermal emission in the hard x - ray and radio spectral bands , then the only explanation for the origin of the hard x - ray is bremsstrahlung of supra - thermal electrons ; and consequently , to fit both x - ray and radio emission a cluster - wide magnetic field of order @xmath53 g ( i.e. close to the equipartition value ) is implied . on the other hand ,",
    "if the accelerated particles are purely provided by numerous , localised external sources of injection , then the only possible origin for the hard x - rays is inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by relativistic electrons , which implies a cluster - wide magnetic field of 0.10.2@xmath53 g .",
    "any independent means of measuring the global cluster magnetic fields would distinguish between the two models .    at present",
    "it is not easy to choose between the models of particle acceleration for coma .",
    "both models : _ in situ _ acceleration ( global ) and shock wave acceleration ( local ) have their advantages and problems . in favour of the _ in situ _",
    "model is the similar morphology between the thermal x - ray and the radio emission .",
    "the radio data have not shown significant structure in the radio intensity in the coma halo which would indicate regions of electron acceleration .",
    "analysis of the thermal x - ray emission from the coma cluster also did not show the strong temperature variations expected from shocks ( arnaud et al . 2001 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "several features indicating recent and ongoing mergers are found in the coma cluster ( e.g. donnelly et al . 1999 ,",
    "arnaud et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these mergers often produce multiple large scale shocks and turbulence capable of both magnetic field amplification and _ in situ _ electron acceleration ( see a recent paper by ohno et al .",
    "2002 on the subject ) .",
    "whether or not these regions extend far enough to allow electrons to fill the whole volume of the halo , remains to be discovered .",
    "if the origins of the radio and x - ray emitting electrons are different , then a much wider range of possible models can be accommodated . for example",
    ", there has been revived interest in the class of secondary electron models where relativistic and thermal protons in the icm collide to produce relativistic ( secondary ) electrons ( dennison 1980 ; blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ; dolag & enlin 2000 ; and miniati et al .",
