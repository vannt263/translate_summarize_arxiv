    "nevertheless it is an empirical fact that , as @xmath9 or for @xmath10 @xmath11 and a few terms of the expansion describe physics correctly .",
    "the lack of convergence of the expansion eq(2 ) reflects the instability of fock vacuum .",
    "quarks and gluons are confined and therefore free quarks and gluons are not a good zeroth order approximation to physics .",

    "the limit of infinite volume is then performed .",
    "if @xmath12 is finite and well defined after these limiting procedures one says that the theory exsists as a field theory .",
    "the procedure also ensures the existence of the analytic continuation to minkowskian space time .    for qcd",

    "a fully rigorous mathematical proof of these statements still does not exist , but it is physically reasonable to say that qcd exists as a field theory .",
    "lattice formulation of qcd is nothing but an approximant of feynman integral in the sequence which defines it : at sufficiently low value of the unrenormalized coupling and at sufficiently large volume it will provide the physical amplitudes with any required precision from first principles ( modulo technical computational difficulties ) .",

    "the result is a good phenomenology and a determination of the condensates @xmath38 however the perturbative expansion of @xmath39 which provides the coefficient @xmath40 , when resummed at higher orders , is ambiguous by terms @xmath41 @xcite,@xcite which mimic the terms with @xmath18 and @xmath42 .",
    "the definition of the condensates is then intrinsically ambiguous .",
    "they could be defined as the coefficients of the terms @xmath43 in the expansion eq(7 ) , but a priori , due to the ambiguity , they could be process dependent , i.e. dependent on the currents under consideration .    an ope of the levels of bound @xmath44 energy levels @xcite@xcite can be also performed .",

    "qcd solves the puzzle .",
    "the singlet axial current is anomalous in qcd and @xmath0 is not a symmetry , being broken at the quantum level .",

    "computing @xmath70 from first principles can provide a cross check of qcd and of the 1/@xmath77 expansion at the same time .",
    "this problem has a long story : tha main difficulty has been for a long time to understand how topology , which is based on continuity , can exist on the lattice which has a discrete structure .",
    "the way out is basic field theory@xcite : any lattice version of the operator @xmath71 , @xmath80 , is related to the continuum counterpart , say in the @xmath81 scheme , by a multiplicative renormalization @xmath82 the product q(x)q(0 ) is singular as @xmath83.the ope gives @xmath84 in computing @xmath70 an additive renormalization is also required.@xcite in conclusion@xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the lattice topological susceptibility of the @xmath87 sector of the vacuum .",
    "a technique developed to compute @xmath88 and @xmath86 is known as `` heating''@xcite : it is based on the fact that topology has a much longer autocorrelation time @xmath89 in montecarlo upgrading than the autocorrelation time @xmath90 of the local quantum fluctuations which dominate the renormalization constants .",
    "therefore @xmath91 can be measured on the configurations obtained at times t such that @xmath92 from a zero field configuration , which has topological charge zero .",

    "the lhs of eq ( 17 ) .",
    "the advantage is in the use of a formulation of the fermions on the lattice which preserves chiral symmetry , and hence has multiplicative renormalization @xmath95 the result is@xcite @xmath96 in complete agreement with the field theoretical determination .",
    "also determinations based on cooling techniques @xcite give consistent estimates . in conclusion",
    "the @xmath0 problem is solved in qcd , and additional legitimation is added to the ideas of @xmath73 . an important issue , as we shall see in the next section , is the behaviour of @xmath70 at the deconfining phase transition .",
    "quarks and gluons are visible at short distances , but have never been observed as free particles .",
    "this fact has lead to the conjecture that colored particles never appear in asymptotic states , a property known as confinement of color .",
    "confinement should be derivable from the qcd lagrangean .",
    "quarks have been searched in nature since they were introduced by gellman as fundamental constituents of hadrons@xcite , with negative results : only upper limits to their abundance and to their production rate have been established@xcite .    the ratio of quark abundance in nature , @xmath97 to that of protons @xmath98 has been given the upper limit @xmath99 to be compared to the expectation based on the standard cosmological model @xmath100 .",
    "as for production in particle reactions the best limit is provided by the inclusive cross section @xmath101 namely @xmath102 to be compared with the expectation , in the absence of confinement , @xmath103 in both cases the ratio is depressed by a factor @xmath104 .",
    "the only natural explanation is that these ratios are exactly zero , i.e. that confinement is an absolute property , and as such based on some symmetry .",
    "experiments have been and are being performed to detect a deconfining transition at high energy density from hadronic matter to a state of free quarks and gluons ( quark gluon plasma ) , in high energy collisions of heavy ions@xcite .",
    "the major difficulty with them is to identify an observable quantity by which deconfinement could be detected .",
    "the partition function of a field theory at temperature t is the euclidean feynman path integral extending in euclidean time from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , with periodic boundary conditions for boson fields , antiperiodic for fermions .    for qcd this",
    "is computed on a lattice of spatial extension @xmath107 and temporal extension @xmath108 with @xmath109 , and the temperature is @xmath110 with @xmath111the lattice spacing in physical units , which can be tuned by varying the unrenormalized coupling constant @xmath112 .      in quenched formulation ( pure gauge , no dynamical quarks )",
    "the criterion consists in looking at the large distance behaviour of the static @xmath113 potential , @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath115 is related to the correlator of polyakov lines @xmath116",
    "@xmath117    by the relation @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the extension of the lattice in the time direction . by definition",
    "the polyakov line is the trace of the parallel transport across the lattice in the time direction . @xmath120\\ ] ] by cluster property @xmath121 if @xmath122 it follows @xmath123 if @xmath124 @xmath125 a transition is observed on the lattice at @xmath126 from a region @xmath127 where @xmath128=0 to a region @xmath129 where @xmath124 .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis allows to determine the order of the transition , which for su(3 ) is first@xcite@xcite .",
    "@xmath128 can be then assumed as an order parameter for confinement , and the corresponding symmetry is @xmath130      in the presence of dynamical quarks ( full qcd ) @xmath130 is not a symmetry anymore and @xmath128 is not an order parameter .",
    "string breaking is expected to take place : when pulling the static @xmath113 pair apart from each other energy is converted into light @xmath132 pairs , and the potential is not linear any more , even if there is confinement .    at @xmath133 another symmetry is present , chiral symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at @xmath134 , and , as lattice data show , is restored at some @xmath135 .",
    "chiral symmetry , however , is explicitely broken by quark masses , and can not be the symmetry responsible for confinement .",
    "a phase dyagram is usually drawn for this system as in fig(4 ) . the line which joins the first order phase transition at @xmath138 ( quenched ) to the chiral transition at @xmath139 corresponds to the values @xmath140 at which the susceptibilities @xmath141 ( specific heat ) and @xmath142 are maximum@xcite@xcite .",
    "an analysis can be made of the chiral phase transition at @xmath139 , assuming that the pions and sigmas are the relevant degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "chiral symmetry fixes then the form of the free energy and renormalization group arguments allow to predict the order of the transition and the corresponding universality class .",
    "for @xmath143 the transition is first order .",
    "for @xmath144 the order depends on the relative weight of the chiral o(4 ) part of the action and the term describing the @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "if the anomaly disappears below @xmath135 the transition is first order , and such is the transition along the line at @xmath145 .",
    "if instead the anomaly persists up to @xmath135 the transition is second order the universality class is @xmath146 and the line at @xmath145 is a crossover . a reliable numerical analysis of this issue is not yet available , but for some reason the second option is more popular",
    ".    the order and the universality class can be investigated by studying the behaviour of the critical specific heat as the volume goes to infinity by a finite size scaling analysis .",
    "a good order parameter should have a behaviour in that limit consistent with that of @xmath141 .the order of the transition and the universality class should be identified by the symmetry responsible for confinement .",
    "a valid candidate symmetry is dual superconductivity of the vacuum@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the chromoelectric field acting between colored particles is channeled into dual abrikosov flux tubes , whose energy is proportional to the length .",
    "here dual means interchange of electric with magnetic with respect to ordinary superconductors .",
    "a disorder parameter @xmath147 has been defined which detects dual superconductivity : it is the vev of an operator @xmath19 carrying magnetic charge which has zero vev in a phase in which vacuum has a definite magnetic charge , and can have a non zero vev if monopoles condense i.e. the vacuum is a superposition of states with different magnetic charge .      in principle @xmath148 or@xmath149 i.e. superconductivity or not depends on the procedure used to identify magnetic charges ( abelian projection ) .",
    "however it can be shown that monopole condensation ( or non condensation ) is an abelian projection independent statement@xcite@xcite .    for quenched theory the result of numericall simulatios",
    "is that this disorder parameter is consistent with @xmath150@xcite@xcite : it is non zero for @xmath127 and strictly zero for @xmath129 . by finite size",
    "scaling analysis of the corresponding susceptibility @xmath151 the same critical indices are obtained as with @xmath152 .",
    "the operator @xmath19 is perfectly well defined also in the presence of dynamical quarks , and can be used to investigate the phase diagram of fig(4 ) .",
    "the result is that the region below the line is really confined , the one above it is deconfined@xcite .    @xmath153 as a function of @xmath154 at fixed @xmath155 has a peak at the same value as the other susceptibilities , i.e. on the line of fig(4 ) . @xmath147",
    "thus provides a good criterion for confinement .    the finite size scaling analysis works as follows . a priori @xmath156 depends on the coupling constant @xmath157 i.e. on the lattice spacing @xmath158 , on the mass @xmath155 and on the lattice size @xmath159",
    ".the dependence on @xmath157 can be traded with the dependence on the correlation length @xmath160 so that , for dimensional reasons @xmath161 as @xmath154 approaches @xmath135 from below , or @xmath162 , @xmath160 diverges as @xmath163 @xmath164 and @xmath165 are critical indices .",
    "if the transition is second order or weak first order @xmath160 goes large as @xmath135 is approached and @xmath166 can be put equal to zero .",
    "because of eq(37 ) @xmath167 can be traded with @xmath168 .",
    "the scaling law follows @xmath169 in the quenched case the second dependence does not exist.the scaling can be tested on the lattice data and the critical index @xmath164 can be extracted@xcite@xcite .",
    "in particular for the peak one finds @xmath170    for the case of full qcd the problem has two scales and the analysis is more complicated .",
    "preliminary results@xcite exclude the critical indices of @xmath146 and seem consistent with a first order phase transition . if this will be confirmed by the additional data in preparation either the anomaly disappears below @xmath135 , or the relevant degrees of freedom which dominate are not the pion and the sigma@xcite .",
    "the first possibility can be checked on the lattice .",
    "the dependence of the topological susceptibility at the deconfining transition has been studied@xcite.fig(5 ) shows the existing data .",
    "a more precise analysis is needed to settle the problem .      in conclusion",
    "there is strong evidence that dual superconductivity is the mechanism of confinement . a candidate disorder parameter exists , which is well defined and seems to work .",
    "the corresponding symmetry is dual superconductivity , which is however not clearly understood formally , being a common feature of all the abelian projections : consequently the effective action is not known .",
