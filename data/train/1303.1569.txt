    "a fundamental reason for such difficulty is that heat transport in graphene is very sensitive to defects and experimental conditions .",
    "for example , when graphene is supported on a substrate @xmath0 is reduced to @xmath8 wm@xmath2k@xmath2at room temperature due to phonon scattering from the substrate  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 can vary by as much as 50@xmath9 at room temperature as a function of the isotopic composition of graphene  @xcite , and was found to be sensitive also to the lateral dimension of measured patches  @xcite and to the presence of wrinkles , which may lower @xmath0 by @xmath10  @xcite .",

    "flexural phonons ( out - of - plane vibrational modes ) play a decisive role both as heat carriers and as scatterers .",

    "theoretical studies suggest that it is possible to control @xmath0 in graphene by applying mechanical ( tensile ) strain , however simulations have given contradictory results .",
