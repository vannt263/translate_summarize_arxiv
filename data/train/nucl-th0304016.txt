    "in a previous paper  @xcite the convergence of a new approach to the description of the nuclear many - body system , based on principles of effective field theory ( eft ) and density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , was studied by applying it to selected nuclei far from stability .",
    "the results of the calculations showed an overall agreement with experiment below 1% for the total binding energy of the doubly magic nuclei @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as for the entire range of known even - even sn isotopes .",
    "in addition , calculations for the chemical potential of nuclei differing by one particle or one hole from these doubly - magic ones , produced results with an overall agreement with experimental values below the 10% level , and also correctly predicted the spin and parity of these nuclei .",
    "it was also shown in  @xcite that the calculations converged to the experimental values as the level of approximation of the effective lagrangian was increased . from the various levels of approximation used , it was found that the ones with the highest levels reproduced better the properties of nuclei far from stability .",
    "in addition to this , it was also observed that when this approach was tested to the whole range of even - even sn isotopes the results obtained agreed equally well with the experimental values .",
    "based on the agreement of these results , a calculation of @xmath4-transition rates was performed for nuclei close to @xmath0  @xcite . here",
    "the objective was to test , through a semi - leptonic process , the accuracy of the single - particle dirac wave functions obtained in  @xcite describing a particle or a hole outside the filled core .",
    "the calculations where done using a current - current interaction hamiltonian in which the lepton current is treated in first - order perturbation theory while the nuclear currents are expanded in multipoles and treated to all orders .",
    "the nuclear electroweak currents used in these calculations are those derived directly from the same effective lagrangian describing the nuclear many - body system . in this way the calculations are done based on a self - consistent approach .",
    "two different cases where explored in  @xcite : particle - particle transitions @xmath5sn@xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8sb@xmath9 and hole - hole transitions @xmath10in@xmath11@xmath7@xmath12sn@xmath13 . the results obtained indicated that the particle - particle transitions proceeding between ground states were well reproduced ( within the 5% level ) while transitions to or from excited states deviate systematically from the experimental values .",
    "this behavior was expected based on the fact that ground - state observables ( in this case the ground - state density and therefore presumably the wave functions ) are best reproduced on the basis of dft .",
    "results obtained in the hole - hole case , in which all transitions start or end on an excited state , are less reliable in reproducing the @xmath4-transition rates . in any case , more studies are underway to understand this behavior .",
    "both papers showed that this eft / dft approach can be used successfully to describe _ some _ ground - state properties of the selected nuclei far from stability ; this extends the applicability of the approach beyond the valley of stability . to further explore the range of validity of this approach ,",
    "the calculations done in  @xcite are extended here to all isotones with magic numbers n= 28 , 50 , 82 , 126 and isotopes with z= 28 , 82 , 126 . extensions of the calculations made in  @xcite are considered in another paper .    the calculations done in  @xcite , which are extended here , are based on an energy functional of the ground - state density @xmath14 $ ] . by minimization of this",
    "energy functional with respect to the density one obtains the ground - state energy and density of the nuclear system .",
    "the existence of a unique functional of the density is guaranteed by the hohenberg - kohn theorem  @xcite .",
    "this minimization process can be computed using a procedure developed by kohn and sham in which the ground - state density of a interacting fermion system is computed using the single - particle wave functions obtained from an equivalent systems of non - interacting fermions subject to an _ appropriate _ external potential , known as the kohn - sham potential  @xcite .",
    "the basis for this procedure is contained in the hohenberg - kohn theorem which can be stated by saying that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the ground - state density of a system of interacting fermions subject to an external potential and the external potential  , vector densities @xmath15 , etc . ] .    although the formulation based on dft is straightforward , the exact energy functional is unknown , particularly in the nuclear system where the exact form of the nuclear interaction is still a subject of intense research . to overcome this ,",
    "an energy functional is constructed based on the principles of effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is an effective lagrangian density that satisfies the symmetries imposed by qcd , which is considered the underlying theory of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "this lagrangian is built using the lowest lying hadronic degrees of freedom ( as well as the electromagnetic field ) .",
    "the result is the most general lagrangian containing ( in principle an infinite number of ) interaction terms constructed using these fields and subject to the imposed symmetries .",
    "the various interaction terms in this lagrangian are ordered in powers of the fields and their derivatives .",
    "this expansion is equivalent to an expansion in the ratios of the fields to the nucleon mass and the fermi momentum to the nucleon mass .",
    "these expansion parameters are small : @xmath161/3 and @xmath161/4 respectively .",
    "naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) , which is a prescription by which the various interaction terms are suppressed by powers of a relevant mass scale @xmath17 ( the nucleon mass m in this case ) , indicates that the remaining coupling constants should be of order unity , a characteristic called  naturalness .",
    " this natural size of the constants can only be verified after fitting the theory to experimental data .",
    "this procedure was done in  @xcite where it is shown that the remaining constants are indeed  natural .",
    " there the constants were fit to ground - state properties of selected spherical nuclei along the valley of stability .",
    "the effective lagrangian , as well as the corresponding equations of motion obtained from it , are shown in the next section .",
    "as has been mentioned before , this paper explores the extent of applicability of this eft / dft approach . to understand the objectives of this work",
    ", one has to keep in mind that the coupling constants of the effective lagrangian have been fit to properties of selected _ stable _ nuclei lying in the @xmath4-stability region .",
    "therefore the results of  @xcite , and the ones presented here , test how well this theory reproduces ground - state properties _ outside _ the stability region . as indicated in  @xcite the relevant observables which can be reproduced , based on dft , are the _ ground - state binding energy _ and _ chemical potential _ of the nuclear system ,",
    "so this paper concentrates on these quantities .",
    "the calculations focus on nuclei with semi - magic number of neutrons , i.e. n = 28 , 50 , 82 and 126 or protons , i.e. z = 28 , 50 and 82 .",
    "in general it is seen that the predictions of the total ground - state binding energy , for both isotones and isotopes , lie below the 1% level as was found in  @xcite , and that as the size of the nucleus increases , the error is reduced .",
    "the agreement between the results of the chemical potential with experimental data is also consistent with the conclusions reached in  @xcite . in the case of the prediction of the ground - state j@xmath18 values of odd nuclei neighboring even - even ones , the agreement with experimental values varies between isotones and isotopes .",
    "when the number of neutrons gets very large in the regime n@xmath19z , the level density gets very high and the detailed ordering of the levels between mayor shells depends sensitively on the details of the various densities .",
    "this small energy shifts ( @xmath16 tens kev ) make the predictions of the ground - state quantum numbers less accurate , though the chemical potentials are still relatively well - described .",
    "all nuclei selected for this study are essentially spherical  @xcite , therefore the approximation of spherically symmetric nuclei , made here , is assumed to be an accurate one .",
    "the calculations are done using the most convergent parameter set obtained in  @xcite , called g1 , which corresponds to the most sophisticated effective lagrangian .",
    "to summarize , this paper extends the calculations made in  @xcite to known semi - magic isotones and isotopes using the g1 parameter set . in the following section the formulation of the kohn - sham equations and potentials",
    "is described , and this is followed by a section on results .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions and proposes new directions of investigation to further test this approach .",
    "in this section an overview of the formalism of eft / dft is presented .",
    "a more thorough presentation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the energy functional that describes the dynamics of the nuclear system is obtained from an effective lagrangian .",
    "this is constructed using the relevant lowest lying hadronic degrees of freedom  @xcite , which are the pion and the rho fields ( isovectors ) and the nucleon field ( isospinor ) .",
    "in addition to these , a scalar field is included to reproduced the known short - range attraction of the nuclear force , and a vector field ( associated to the @xmath20 meson ) that reproduces the mid - range repulsion of the nuclear interaction is also included .    the pion field is introduced as the phase of a chiral rotation of the identity matrix in isospin space .",

    "@xmath26    the @xmath27-field has been added to the lagrangian to include contributions coming from the asymmetry between the number of protons and neutrons .",
    "in addition to the above fields , an electromagnetic field @xmath28 is included and the electromagnetic structure of the nucleons is also taken into account .",
    "their anomalous magnetic moments , labeled as @xmath29 and @xmath30 for proton and neutron respectively , then enter .",
    "the effective lagrangian contains , in principle , an infinite number of terms . in order to make the theory predictive",
    ", these terms have to be arranged according to some ordering scheme that takes into account all equally contributing terms . here",
    "the various interaction terms in the effective lagrangian are arranged following the prescriptions of nda  @xcite . as mentioned before",

    "the disagreement in the location of the ground - state shows the sensitivity of the actual ordering of states to the form of the central potential .",
    "one can understand this by looking at the effects of putting additional neutrons into the system .",
    "there is a major shell closure at n=28 . if one more neutron is added to the system it will go into the next j - shell which is @xmath97 corresponding to a 2p3/2 level , as expected from the naive shell model",
    "this level becomes completely filled at n=32 , since @xmath98 , which is correctly predicted as can be seen in the plot .",
    "adding one more particle to this nucleus , should start filling the next j - shell , the 1f5/2 level , giving the ground state the quantum numbers 5/2- as predicted .",
    "instead , it seems that it is energetically more favorable to promote one particle from the 2p3/2 level to the 1f5/2 leaving a hole .",
    "the two particles in the 1f5/2 level do not contribute to the angular momentum , which is solely determined by this hole in the 2p3/2 .",
    "adding more neutrons fills the 1f5/2 until it is completely full at n=38 , since @xmath99 , which again is correctly predicted .",
    "after this , more neutrons just start filling the next level , 2p1/2 , following the ordering given by the naive shell model",
    ". therefore the predictions follow very closely the way the neutron levels are being filled and the fact that the disagreement at n=33 is small only shows how sensitive the ordering is to the form of the central potential .",
    "the exact ordering of energy levels has a larger effect when the level density is high and the levels are very close together .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the case of isotopes with large values of z. for any given z the density level of neutrons close to the fermi surface is larger since in general n@xmath100z making the energy levels very close to each other .",
    "this can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ ph - z50 ] where , if there is a disagreement between the calculated and experimental ground - state value of j@xmath18 , the lowest - lying excited state with the calculated quantum numbers has also been plotted  @xcite . note in particular the small ( @xmath16 tens of kev )",
    "energy differences between these states and each case and the fact that there is always a partner with quantum numbers that agree with the ones predicted for the ground - state . as for similar cases before , the energy difference has been exaggerated to be appreciated at this scale .    a similar effect occurs in the case of the isotopes of pb ( z=82 ) . figure  [ ph - z82 ] shows the filled j - shell states closest to @xmath101 which is a mayor shell closure . adding an extra neutron to this nucleus will start filling the next j - shell , which according to the naive shell model is a 2g9/2 state .",
    "this is precisely what is predicted here as can be seen in this figure for the particle state at n=126 ( i.e. n=127 ) .",
    "removing a neutron from @xmath101 corresponds to depleting the 3p1/2 state , as can be seen in the figure , and again it is also correctly predicted .",
    "since @xmath101 formed part of the nuclei used to fit the parameters of the theory , it is expected that there will be an accurate description of the neighboring nuclei , and in fact there is .",
    "removing one additional neutron completely depletes the @xmath102 shell bringing the total number of neutrons to n=124 , which is also observed occurring in this plot . according to  @xcite ( see footnote above ) the next hole level",
    "would be a 1i13/2 level , i.e. 13/2 + , but the experimental evidence indicates that this level is in fact a 5/2- .",
    "the reordering of the levels , with respect to the naive shell model , can be understood as either a large splitting between the 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 levels , which brings the 3p1/2 level above the 1i13/2 , or a considerable lowering of the 1i13/2 which brings the 1i13/2 below the 3p1/2 . in either case",
    "removing one more neutron from this nucleus will start depleting the next j - shell which could be a 3p3/2 or a 2f5/2 . in fig .",
    "[ ph - z82 ] it is shown that this level is a 5/2- in disagreement with the calculated one , 3/2- .",
    "the closest excited state having this predicted quantum numbers lies only 262 kev above the ground - state .",
    "this state is also plotted  @xcite .",
    "the energy difference has been exaggerated in the figure , as in the previous plots .",
    "the reordering between the 2f5/2 and 3p3/2 , shift the position of the real j - shell closures with respect to the calculated ones , as happened for the z=50 isotopes shown in fig .",
    "[ ph - z50 ] ; therefore they have not been included in this plot . despite this disagreement ,",
    "the magnitude of the chemical potentials of these nuclei are relatively well described .    in summary",
    ", these results show that the binding energy of all even - even nuclei with semi - magic numbers of neutrons and protons , n = 28 , 50 , 82 , 126 and z = 28 , 50 , 82 are reproduced to 1% or better in this eft / dft approach with parameters g1 fit along the valley of stability . with all the isotones , the chemical potential of nuclei with a single proton particle or hole outside of filled j - shells is well reproduced and the predicted value of j@xmath18 for the ground - state of these nuclei agrees with experiment .",
    "when the number of neutrons gets very large in the regime where",
    "n @xmath19 z , the level density is very high and the detailed ordering of the levels between major shells depends sensitively on the details of the various densities .",
    "thus , while the chemical potential ( binding energies ) are still relatively well - described , the theory begins to lose its predictive power for the spin and parity of the ground states of single neutron particle and hole nuclei neighboring those with filled j - shells .",
    "this work investigates the applicability of the eft / dft approach to reproduce _ total binding energies _ and _ chemical potentials _ of semi - magic nuclei ( n = 28 , 50 , 82 , 126 and z= 28 , 50 , 82 ) far from the valley of stability .",
    "it extends the work done in  @xcite , where the convergence of this eft / dft approach was studied for doubly - magic nuclei .",
    "all calculations were performed using an independently developed program to solve the kohn - sham equations derived from the most sophisticated effective lagrangian given in  @xcite with parameter set g1 .    from the figures given in the previous section ,",
    "several conclusions are drawn :    1 .",
    "the eft / dft approach can reproduce the total binding energies of even - even isotones and isotopes with semi - magic numbers of neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "the agreement is in general better than 1 % where the best results are obtained for larger nuclei .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the previous results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the magnitude of the chemical potentials for odd nuclei corresponding to particle or holes neighboring filled j - shells agree overall with the experimental evidence .",
    "this agreement varies for different nuclei and on average lies between 10% and 20% .",
    "3 .   regarding the predictions of the ground - state quantum numbers of odd nuclei neighboring even - even nuclei with filled j - shells ,",
    "the results indicate that in the case of isotones these are accurately reproduced ; for heavy isotopes with n @xmath19 z , although the predictions of chemical potentials are in essential agreement with experiment , the eft / dft approach begins to lose its predictive power .",
    "overall , the use of this effective field theory approach for qcd and the interpretation of the resulting relativistic hartree equations through kohn - sham potentials and density functional theory  @xcite provides an excellent description of the ground - state properties of semi - magic nuclei when extrapolated away from the valley of stability .",
