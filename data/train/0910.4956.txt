    "this article is concerned with liquid xenon as radiation detector medium , and the experiments which use it in search of answers to some of the most intriguing questions in physics today .",
    "it is a tribute to the vision of those investigators who recognized early on the opportunity that this material would offer for particle detectors , and who have continued their effort in the field for more than 30 years , inspiring new generations .",
    "their vision and persistent work has significantly contributed to the successful realization of today s experiments using large scale liquid xenon detectors .    historically , the advantages of liquid xenon for radiation detection were first recognized by alvarez in 1968 @xcite . simultaneously with the development of the first liquid xenon ionization detector by the berkeley group , independent groups in russia and japan have also carried out experiments to study the fundamental properties of liquid xenon for radiation detection . from the seminal work of dolgoshein @xcite , doke , kubota @xcite and co - workers , to the first development of a large volume liquid xenon time projection chamber as a compton telescope @xcite , we have seen an evolution in liquid detectors and their application in different fields . exploiting the original idea by dolgoshein of electron emission from the liquid to the gas",
    ", two - phase time projection chambers with single electron detection capability have been developed to search for dark matter particles . from space - based detectors for astrophysical gamma - rays , to detectors located at accelerators or deep underground in search of rare decays expected from physics beyond the standard model , liquid xenon remains the preferred medium for many reasons . among liquid rare gases ,",
    "liquid xenon has the highest stopping power for penetrating radiation , thanks to its high atomic number and density .",
    "it also has the highest ionization and scintillation yield , the latter comparable to that of nai(tl ) and with a faster time response .",
    "compared to all other detector media , liquid rare gases have the unique feature of responding to radiation with both ionization electrons and scintillation photons .",
    "detectors which use both signals with high detection efficiency have a significant advantage in the measurement of the properties of the radiation . in recent years",
    ", much progress has been made in the development of photodetectors with high quantum efficiency at the 178 nm wavelength of the liquid xenon scintillation .",
    "simultaneously , progress in the development of cryo - coolers with sufficient power to liquefy and maintain the liquid temperature has enabled reliable detector s operation .",
    "the relatively warm temperature of liquid xenon , compared to other liquid rare gases , makes the removal of electronegative contaminants more difficult to achieve , since at colder temperatures , many impurities freeze out . on the other hand , purification systems with continuous cleaning through commercial purifiers , have shown the required level of purity in large volume liquid xenon detectors .",
    "the current challenge for several experiments is in the stringent radio - purity requirement for all materials in contact with the liquid , from containment vessels and cryo - coolers to photon and charge read - out sensors . through materials",
    "selection and screening , the background level and the sensitivity of liquid xenon experiments for rare event searches continues to improve .",
    "twenty years ago the standard size of a liquid xenon detector was limited to a few hundred grams of mass .",
    "ten year ago the lxegrit and the rapid time projection chambers had a mass of 30 kg and 60 kg , respectively . today the xenon100 and the exo time projection chambers have a mass of about 200 kg .",
    "the meg experiment is currently operating the largest liquid xenon scintillating calorimeter with a mass of 2.7 tons .",
    "several other detectors from 300 kg to 3 tons are under construction or are planned for the next few years .",
    "most of the success of liquid xenon detectors can be attributed to the richness of the information contained in its charge and light signals .",
    "looking back at the development over the last twenty years , it seems appropriate to summarize our current understanding and the status of the field .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in [ sec : fundamental ] we summarize the properties of liquid xenon as detector medium , based on well established experimental knowledge , some dating back more than fifty years , but accounting for the most recent works . in [ sec : det_type ] , we review the basic operating principle of different type of detectors while the last chapter covers the applications of liquid xenon detectors in physics , astrophysics and medical imaging experiments .",
    "some selection was necessary , largely to comply with the length limit for this review , but we have tried to include the majority of current and planned experiments .",
    "we have included our own research work on many of the topics and experiments discussed in this review , but have attempted also to cover all important contributions from other groups and authors and apologize for any omission .",
    "we review here the most important physical and operational properties of liquid xenon ( lxe ) as a detector medium for different types of particles .",
    "a unique and important feature of lxe , shared only by liquid argon ( lar ) among liquid rare gases , and specific to this class of materials , is the production of both charge carriers and scintillation photons in response to radiation .",
    "the charge and light signals are highly complementary and anti - correlated .",
    "when detected simultaneously and with high efficiency , the two signals enable a precise measurement of the particle s properties from its energy and interactions history in space and time , to its type .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes the physical properties of lxe critical to its function as a detector medium @xcite .",
    "the high atomic number ( 54 ) and high density ( @xmath2 3 g/@xmath3 ) of lxe make it very efficient to stop penetrating radiation .",
    "compared to a crystal scintillator such as nai ( tl ) or to a semiconductor such as ge , lxe offers the high stopping power benefit in a single large and homogeneous volume , which is not easily possible with the other media .",
    "the presence of many isotopes in natural xe , with different spin and at a non negligible isotopic abundance , is of interest for different physics applications , as we will discuss in [ sec : applications ] .",
    "figure [ fig : phases ] shows a phase diagram of crystalline , liquid , and gaseous xenon @xcite . at atmospheric pressure ,",
    "the liquid phase of xe extends over a narrow temperature range , from about 162 k to 165 k. the relatively high boiling point temperature of lxe , compared to other liquid rare gases , requires a modest cryogenics system for gas liquefaction .",
    "the electronic band structure picture is useful for understanding the ionization and the scintillation processes in lxe .",
    "solid rare gases are excellent insulators .",
    "they are crystals , with a face - centered cubic structure . with the exception of solid helium",
    ", they have electronic band structures , despite the very weak atomic interactions due to van der waals forces .",
    "absorption spectroscopy provides the most direct method to measure the band gap energy , @xmath4 , which is the energy difference between the bottom of the conduction band and the top the valence band , as in a semiconductor or an insulator .",
    "figure [ fig : abs_spectra ] shows the high resolution absorption spectra for solid ar , kr , and xe from which the band gaps have been determined ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "exciton peaks were clearly observed in these spectra , providing direct evidence of the band structure of the solid rare gases .",
    "the observation of the exciton level @xcite and the direct measurement of the band gap energy of lxe , lar and lkr @xcite , determined that the liquids also have a band structure ( see table [ w - value ] ) .",

    "the @xmath41-value is defined as the average energy required to produce one electron - ion pair , and is given as : @xmath42 in solid or liquid rare gases , the established existence of an electronic band structure , allows us to rewrite the platzman equation with the band gap energy , @xmath4 , replacing the ionization potential of the gas : @xmath43 to calculate @xmath44 for lxe , the ratios @xmath45 and @xmath46 were estimated by using the oscillator strength spectrum of solid xe obtained from photo - absorption data , in the optical approximation @xcite . for e@xmath47 ,",
    "the data of rossler @xcite are used , assuming the width of the valence band to be negligibly small . for an estimate of @xmath40 ,",
    "the shockley model @xcite was used .",
    "the calculated ratio @xmath44 are about 1.65 for lxe , lar and lkr , in good agreement with the measured values of about 1.6 for all three liquids , reported in table [ w - value ] .",
    "this supports the electronic band structure assumption for the liquid rare gases heavier than ne .",
    "the ionization yield is defined as the number of electron - ion pairs produced per unit absorbed energy . in radiation chemistry , the @xmath48-value",
    "is usually used as such unit , defined to be the average number of electron - ion pairs produced per 100 ev of absorbed energy . in physics , however , we prefer to use the @xmath41-value , which is inversely proportional to @xmath48 . since the @xmath41-value depends weakly on the type and the energy of the radiation , except for very low energies , we consider it to be almost constant .",
    "therefore the ionization signal produced in a lxe detector can be used to measure the deposited energy . to correctly measure the number of electron - ion pairs produced by radiation in lxe",
    ", one needs ( a ) to minimize the loss of charge carriers by attachment to impurities , i.e. the liquid has to be ultra pure ; ( b ) to minimize the recombination of electron - ion pairs and thus collect all the original charge carriers produced , i.e. by applying a very high electric field and ( c ) to estimate the deposited energy correctly .",
    "measurements of the ionization yield in lxe have been carried out with small gridded ionization chambers that met these requirements , irradiated with electrons and gamma - rays from internal radioactive sources . from these measurements , the @xmath41-value is inferred by extrapolation to infinite field .",

    "the design @xcite , included a long barrel homogeneous calorimeter and two end - cap sampling calorimeters .        a full length ( 66 cm ) lxe prototype cell with a volume of 4 liters was built to investigate the light collection uniformity in the homogeneous section of the calorimeter ( see figure [ fig : fig40b ] ) .",
    "the cell walls , made of mgf@xmath49-coated al , were used as uv reflectors with 85 - 90% reflectivity .",
    "three large area , uv - sensitive , silicon photodiodes with mesh type surface electrode , detected the lxe scintillation @xcite .            to achieve sufficient longitudinal uniformity , the cell had a tapered shape for a focusing effect , in addition to using tiny light collimators in the form of grids coated with al , placed in front of the photodiodes .",
    "the relative light collection uniformity was measured with such lxe cell , using cosmic ray muons and alpha particles .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : fig41 ] @xcite .",
    "good uniformity was obtained , at the expense , however of a drastic reduction in number of photons collected . as a result ,",
    "the energy resolution , estimated from monte carlo simulations @xcite , was about 0.5% ( @xmath50 ) for energies above 50 gev , almost the same as that of a lar calorimeter @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the mit - itep - dubna collaboration , constructed a full - scale prototype of a lxe / lkr scintillation calorimeter , consisting of 45 unit cells , schematically shown in figure [ fig : fig40_mod ] @xcite .",
    "the walls of each unit cell were partly coated with strips of wavelength shifter ( p - therphenyl ) to convert the vuv light to visible light @xcite and the silicon photodiodes were replaced with pmts . figure [ fig : fig42 ] shows a schematic of the unit cell and of the full calorimeter reflector structure @xcite .",

    "this energy resolution was not as good as that typical of the liquid xenon ionization calorimeter discussed above . in subsequent years",
    ", much improvement was achieved as a result of new developments in photodetectors for the xe vuv light , which could be operated directly in the liquid . in the following we discuss two experiments dedicated to two rare processes expected from new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",

    "the gamma - rays can be emitted either from the charged pion and muon ( this term is called internal bremsstrahlung ib ) or directly from the decay vertex due to the composite nature of the pion ( structure dependent term sd ) .",
    "when squaring the decay matrix to get the decay probability , an interference term ( int ) appears , which is proportional to sd@xmath53ib .",
    "the ib term is a pure qed term , well described and calculable within the frame of this theory .",
    "the sd term takes into account the fact that the pion is not an elementary particle but is constituted by quarks . in the pion to muon radiative decay , however , both the sd term and the int term are heavily suppressed compared to the ib term . with a very good approximation",
    ", the gamma - rays emitted from this decay can be thought of as a pure qed process .",
    "qed calculations show that for a pion decay at rest the gamma spectrum is strongly peaked at zero , falling approximately as 1/__e__@xmath54 up to the maximum energy of 30 mev .",
    "the goal of the rapid experiment was to measure the energy of both the muon and the gamma produced in the decay , in order to obtain not only the branching ratio but also the full two - dimensional distribution .",
    "for the detection of the gamma - ray , lxe was recognized as an optimum medium and an ionization tpc with a 38 liter sensitive volume , self - triggered by the scintillation light was adopted to achieve low energy threshold , high detection efficiency and good energy resolution .",
    "the tpc , shown in figure [ fig : rapid ] , is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a 64 liter cylindrical vessel , with a gamma - ray entrance window made of one 1 mm - thick titanium and 12 quartz windows for the detection of the scintillation light with vuv - sensitive pmts . the electrode structure , for the detection of the ionization signal , consists of 6 drift regions , each 6.3 cm long with a shielding grid at 3 mm from the anode . with an applied electric field of 0.5 kv / cm ,",
    "the energy threshold achieved was 230 kev .",
    "this was the first large volume tpc successfully implemented for a physics experiment , and the first to address the demanding requirement of high purity of the liquid for charge drift and a long - term stability of the charge yield .",

    "the rare @xmath0 e@xmath1 decay is the most promising lepton flavor violating process , with a predicted branching ratio above 10@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the first ( and present ) experimental upper limit to this branching ratio was reported in 1999 at a level of 1.2@xmath5310@xmath60 @xcite . in the same year ,",
    "an experiment capable to improve on this limit by at least two orders of magnitude was proposed @xcite , based on the original suggestion by doke to use a position sensitive lxe scintillating calorimeter , with excellent energy and position resolution , later to be known as the meg detector @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0 e@xmath1 decay event is characterized by the clear 2-body final state where the decay positron and the gamma ray are emitted in opposite directions with energies equal to half the muon mass ( _ e _ = 52.8 mev ) . while positrons of this energy are abundant from the standard michel decays of muons , gamma rays with such high energies are very rare .",
    "therefore the key requirement for the meg detector is high energy resolution for gamma rays , since the accidental background rate decreases , at least , with the square of the energy resolution @xcite .",
    "the excellent properties of lxe as scintillator and the developments of new pmts with high quantum efficiency , fast timing and their possible operation in lxe , motivated the choice of the detector for the meg experiment . with the xe scintillation light detected by a large number of pmts immersed in the liquid volume ,",
    "the detector s energy resolution is proportional to 1/@xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the number of photoelectrons , and was estimated to be better than 1% ( @xmath50 ) for 52.8 mev gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gamma - ray interaction points can also be determined from the light distribution on individual pmts @xcite . following the r&d with a small prototype @xcite and with further improvement of the metal channel type pmt ,",
    "a large lxe prototype ( 68.6 l ) with 228@xmath532  pmts was constructed and tested with gamma rays of 10 to 83 mev @xcite .",
    "the prototype and associated cooling and purification apparatus , shown schematically in figure [ fig : fig47 ] , were tested at the paul scherrer institute in switzerland , where the final meg experiment is located . in this prototype ,",
    "a pulse tube refrigerator ( ptr ) was used for the first time to condense xe gas and maintain the liquid temperature stable over long periods of time .",
    "the ptr , optimized for liquid xenon , had a cooling power of 189 w at 165 k @xcite .",
    "this prototype was large enough to test both the reliability and stability of the cryogenics system based on the ptr and the efficiency of the purification system required for the calorimeter s performance .",
    "the study of the impact of impurities on xe scintillation light transmission was particularly important and valuable to later lxe detectors , such as those developed for dark matter searches discussed earlier .",
    "while the transmission of the scintillation light is also affected by rayleigh scattering , this process does not cause any loss of light and hence does not affect the energy resolution .",
    "two types of purification systems were developed for studies with this prototype .",
    "one is a gaseous purification system where liquid xenon is evaporated , purified by a heated metal getter , and then liquefied back in the cryostat @xcite .",
    "this method is effective in removing all types of impurities but not efficient , since the purification speed is limited by the cooling power .",
    "the other method was developed specifically to remove water , which was identified as the major contributor to light absorption , at a much higher rate ( 100 @xmath63/hr ) by circulating the lxe with a cryogenic centrifugal pump .",
    "water is efficiently removed by a filter containing molecular sieves . using this method ,",
    "the total impurity concentration was reduced in 5 hours from 250 ppb to 40 ppb in the total 100 liters lxe volume of the meg prototype @xcite .",
    "novel calibration and monitoring techniques have also been developed with this prototype study .",
    "in particular , a lattice of radioactive point - sources was developed by permanently suspending in the active volume ( 100 micron diameter ) gold - plated tungsten wires carrying a small amount of @xmath64am @xcite .",
    "this method was successfully implemented and used to determine the relative quantum efficiencies of all the pmts and monitor the stability of the detector during the experiment . in the final meg detector ,",
    "the pmt configuration is similar to that tested in the prototype , hence the methods of reconstructing the gamma - ray energy and interaction points were proven with the prototype . the reconstructed energy distribution for 55 mev gamma rays from @xmath65 decay is shown in figure [ fig : fig48 ] @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is asymmetric with a low - energy tail , caused mainly by gamma - ray interactions with materials in front of the sensitive region and by the leakage of shower components .",
    "the estimated energy resolution at the upper edge is 1.2 @xmath58 0.1% ( @xmath50 ) @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : fig48 ] , which is roughly equal to the value obtained by extrapolation of the small prototype data .",
    "the events remaining above 55 mev are known to be due to mis - tagging of @xmath65 events .",
    "the position and time resolutions are evaluated to be 5 mm and @xmath2120 ps ( fwhm ) respectively @xcite .",
    "the meg cryostat , consisting of cold and warm vessels , is designed to reduce passive materials at the gamma - ray entrance .",
    "the same ptr tested on the prototype will be used for cooling , with an emergency cooling system based on liquid nitrogen flowing through pipes installed both inside the cold vessel and on its outer warm vessel .",

    "as majorana particles , they can also decay into two electrons without emitting neutrinos , giving a signal at a single well - defined energy .",

    ", the lifetime would be in the region of 10@xmath70 - 10@xmath71 years , which in the case of @xmath69xe requires 1 - 10 tons of that isotope for observation of a few events in 1 - 2 years .",

    "however , production of enriched xenon requires about an order of magnitude more xenon to start with .",
    "given that the world production is only about 30 tons of xenon per year , it is clear that the procurement of such large amounts of xenon enriched in xe-136 poses a major challenge for the realization of these experiments .",
    "a more positive signal identification can be obtained by the detection of the ba@xmath76 ion to which the @xmath69xe decays , in coincidence with the electron ionization signal .",
    "this was first suggested in @xcite .",
    "individual atoms of @xmath69ba may be detected using fluorescent spectrometry with laser excitation .",
    "different methods for extraction of ions from liquid xenon have been considered by the exo collaboration , including the use of a cryo - tip or an optical fiber tip , both of which have stringent technical requirements @xcite .",
    "exo-200 will not test the ba tagging method .",
    "an alternative approach has been recently proposed by arisaka @xcite with the xax ( @xmath69xe - ar-@xmath77xe ) detector concept , which combines dark matter detection with 0@xmath78 decay , and includes a concentric arrangement of @xmath79 tons enriched @xmath69xe surrounded by 5 tons depleted xe ( @xmath77xe ) which provides simultaneously a dark matter target and shielding for the 0@xmath68 decay target .",
    "the @xmath77xe also provides a pp solar neutrino detector , free from the @xmath72 decay background in natural xe .",
    "a separate ar detector is proposed as a comparison target for dark matter signals .",
    "background studies for this scheme indicate that the 0@xmath68 decay sensitivity would be competitive with the exo scheme without the need for the complex ba tagging .",
    "the excellent properties of liquid xenon for gamma - ray detection make it also very attractive for single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) and positron emission tomography ( pet ) , the two primary modalities in use for functional medical imaging .",
    "the large majority of spect and pet systems in use today are based on crystal scintillators as detection media .",
    "the first application of liquid xenon for spect @xcite , used a multi - wire proportional counter with a position resolution of 4 mm fwhm .",
    "however , the counter suffered significant instabilities precluding its use as a practical gamma camera . in 1983 , egorov et al . constructed a gamma - camera using electroluminescence emission in high pressure xenon gas",
    "an intrinsic spatial resolution of 3.5 mm ( fwhm ) and an energy resolution of 15% ( fwhm ) for 122 kev gamma - rays were obtained @xcite .",
    "most of the subsequent r&d on liquid xenon detectors for medical imaging has focused on pet systems , with two approaches : 1 ) detectors which measure the energy and location of gamma - rays from the ionization signal , with the scintillation signal used only as an event trigger , and 2 ) detectors which use only the scintillation signal to measure the energy and location of gamma - rays .",
    "we discuss recent developments in both approaches .",
    "while it will be clear that using all the features of lxe ( good energy resolution from combined ionization and light , high spatial resolution and compton reconstruction ) in a high rate , high sensitivity pet system is potentially very important for medical imaging , there are several practical issues such as cost , safety , complexity compared to conventional systems , plus the added requirement to produce fast images , complicated by the compton reconstruction , which will require additional studies before this technology is accepted for such applications .      the principle of a pet system as diagnostic tool in medicine is to infer the location of a tumor from the measurement of the 3-d location of a radiotracer previously injected into the patient and labeled with positron emitting nuclides , such as @xmath80c , @xmath81n , @xmath82o or @xmath83f .",
    "the emitted positrons slow down in the surrounding patient s tissue annihilating with atomic electrons to give two back - to - back 511 kev annihilation photons .",
    "the annihilation occurs within a few millimeters from the positron source . by detecting the two photons in coincidence and the coordinates of their interaction points in a detector , it is possible to define a line along which the positron emitting source is located in the patient .",
    "a set of such intersecting lines allows 3-d reconstruction of the source .",
    "thus the main requirements for a pet detector are : ( a ) high photon detection efficiency ( @xmath280% for each 511 kev gamma ) , ( b ) position resolution of a few millimeters , ( c ) time resolution to reduce the rate of false coincidences , ( d ) good energy resolution ( @xmath84 kev fwhm ) to discriminate photons scattered in the patient and , ( e ) a high count rate capability ( @xmath210@xmath85 -10@xmath86 s@xmath29 per @xmath87 of detecting surface ) .    a lxe based pet detector should be able to improve on the energy and position resolution currently achieved with commercial whole - body pet scanners based on crystal scintillators .",
    "the scintillation of lxe is also faster than that from most crystal scintillators , allowing time of flight measurement , as will be discussed later . in a typical high z , high density detector medium ,",
    "the 511 kev gamma rays interact predominantly via compton scattering , i.e. the energy is deposited in one or more interaction points before the gamma ray is photo - absorbed .",
    "the interaction points are too close to be resolved and the average location is taken approximately as the first interaction point , which is then the only point on the original gamma ray trajectory .",
    "if the detector is a lxetpc such as the one discussed in [ sec : compton_tele ] , the combined measurement of spatial coordinates and energy loss in each interaction point , allows one to use compton kinematics to determine the sequence of interactions ( compare figure [ fig : compton ] ) . with the first interaction point known ,",
    "the lower z and density of lxe compared to typical crystal scintillators used in pet , is no longer a disadvantage .",
    "the first idea of using a lxetpc for pet was proposed in 1993 by chepel with subsequent r&d documented in @xcite .",
    "the setup used for the tests of this first compton pet is schematically shown in figure [ fig : pet_coimbra ] . the detector was a lxe multi - wire detector consisting of six ionization cells , each formed by two parallel cathode plates with a multi - wire anode in the middle .",
    "negative voltage is applied to the cathode , with the anode wires ( 50 @xmath88 m diameter , 2.5 mm spacing ) at ground .",
    "the 20 anode wires were connected in pairs to reduce the number of readout channels .",
    "the signal from each charge channel was fed to a low - noise charge - sensitive preamplifier followed by a linear amplifier , connected to a leading edge discriminator and a peak - sensing adc .",
    "a typical noise level of 800 electrons fwhm was achieved for the charge readout .",
    "the scintillation light produced in the active lxe filling the cell was detected by two hamamastu r1668 pmts , coupled to the cell through quartz windows . for each pmt ,",
    "the fast signal from the last dynode was fed into a constant fraction discriminator ( cfd ) for triggering and the anode signal was amplified and shaped for measuring the light amplitude .",
    "the x - coordinate of the interaction point is determined with a precision better than 1 mm ( @xmath50 ) by measuring the electron drift time , triggered by the light signal .",
    "the identification of the pair of wires on which the charge is collected gives the depth of the interaction ( z - coordinate ) , with a resolution estimated at 2 - 5 mm ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "for measurement of the y - coordinate , at first , the ratio of the amplitudes of the two pmts was used but the position resolution was only @xmath210 mm ( @xmath50 ) . to improve this resolution by about a factor of ten",
    ", the use of a mini - strip plate ( figure [ fig : strip_plate ] ) was considered @xcite , and several tests for this electrode system were conducted . however , to our knowledge this position resolution has not yet been achieved for 511 kev gamma rays , although a multi - strip ionization chamber was tested with 122 kev gamma rays , obtaining a position resolution of @xmath89 mm ( @xmath50 ) @xcite .",
    "recently two new groups have undertaken further r&d towards this challenge , the nantes - subatech group in france @xcite and the columbia group @xcite . while single point position resolution is an important parameter of a lxe detector for pet , the double point resolution , i.e. the minimum distance required between two sources to be still separated in the image . as discussed by giboni et al .",
    "@xcite , this double point resolution depends not only on position resolution , but also on statistics of events from the sources , as well as on the background from unrelated events . in an image ,",
    "these factors determine the contrast besides the background from wrong compton sequencing .",
    "there is a very strong background from genuine positron annihilation events with at least one gamma ray compton scattering even before leaving the patient .",
    "most of these scatters are very forward , with a small angle to the original direction , and with only a small change in gamma ray energy .",
    "to identify and reject this background as far as possible , energy resolution is by far the most important factor . in @xcite , the lxe tpc proposed as compton pet",
    "( see figure [ fig : pet_1 ] and figure [ fig : pet_2 ] ) relies on the improved energy resolution that results from the sum of the anti - correlated ionization and scintillation signals demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the estimated fwhm energy resolution of 4% must be compared with 15% and 25% for present gso and bgo crystal scintillators .",
    "efficient light detection with pmts immersed in the lxe helps not only the energy resolution but also provides very good coincidence timing .",
    "giboni et al .",
    "@xcite measured a timing resolution of about 270 ps for 511 kev gamma rays in lxe .",
    "this might not yet be sufficient for a pure tof - pet , but is sufficient for tof - assisted pet .",
    "compton kinematics not only determines the sequence of interaction points , but also constrains the direction of the incoming photon to the surface of a cone .",
    "the opening angle of the cone is the compton scattering angle in the first interaction point . if the incoming directions are thus determined for both annihilation gamma rays , even if one of the gamma rays scatters within the body , one can still determine the original line on which the annihilation gamma rays were emitted .",
    "the number of events with one of the gamma rays scattering once in the body amounts to about twice the number of non - scattered events .",
    "therefore , with compton reconstruction , the number of acceptable events is nearly a factor 3 larger than the number of good events in a standard pet detector @xcite .",
    "this increased detection efficiency results in a reduction of the radiation dose for the patient .",
    "the approach used by a nantes - subatech group uses a micro - structure pattern readout for the charge and a gaseous photomultiplier ( gpm ) @xcite for the light signal .",
    "the aim is to achieve an energy resolution similar to that of aprile et al .",
    "@xcite , and a @xmath90 0.1 mm position resolution , in order to reconstruct the incident angle of the 511 kev gamma - rays with an angular resolution less than 2@xmath91 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "moreover , another medical imaging technique has been proposed by the same group @xcite , aimed at reducing the examination time and the radiation dose for the patient .",
    "this technique is based on precise location in organs of a 3-photon emitter ( scandium-44 ) .",
    "the method would provide high resolution imaging by combining the information from a pet with the direction cone defined by a third gamma ray .",
    "the first lxe compton telescope prototype has been built and is under testing .",
    "it features a 3@xmath533@xmath5312 @xmath3 active volume ( figure [ fig : fig1dom ] ) .",
    "the lxe cryogenics are controlled by a dedicated pulse tube cryocooler @xcite , the same machine used on the xenon100 and meg experiments .",
    "first results are very promising , demonstrating for the first time the complete collection of the ionization electrons by using a so - called micromegas detector , fully immersed in lxe @xcite .",
    "the scintillation signal has been so far detected by a standard pmt , to be replaced by a gpm @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a tof pet , based on the excellent properties of lxe as scintillator , was first suggested by lavoie in 1976 @xcite , and the study of this type of pet was carried out in 1997 by the waseda group .",
    "a prototype , consisting of two lxe chambers , was constructed in 2000 . in its initial implementation",
    ", each chamber has a lxe sensitive volume of 120@xmath5360@xmath5360 mm@xmath67 viewed by only 32@xmath531  pmts , with one side left uncovered as an entrance window for gamma rays ( figure [ fig : fig53 ] ) .",
    "a schematic of the whole assembly is shown in figure [ fig : fig54 ] .",
    "the distance between the entrance planes is 70 cm .",
    "testing began in 2001 @xcite , and soon thereafter , improved pmts became available and were used in the prototype @xcite .",
    "testing of the prototype with the new pmts was carried out with a @xmath92na source placed in the center of the setup .",
    "the output signals from the 32 pmts of each chamber were recorded by charge - sensitive analog - to - digital converters ( qadcs ) , and the tof information was recorded with time - to - digital converters ( tdcs ) .",
    "the position of a gamma ray interaction was determined by the time of flight of the gamma ray to the pmts .",
    "the position distributions of interaction points in x - y , x - z and y - z planes inside the sensitive volume , reconstructed with this method , are shown in figure [ fig : fig56 ] .    the energy resolution obtained from the sum of 32 pmts was 26.0% ( fwhm ) @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the time difference spectrum between the two detectors was 514 ps ( fwhm ) for annihilation gamma rays . for a central volume of 5@xmath535@xmath535 mm@xmath67 an even better time resolution of 253",
    "ps was obtained .",
    "it is expected that the time resolution improves inversely proportional to @xmath61 , i.e. an increase in the quantum efficiency or the light collection efficiency will improve the timing .",
    "this is within reach , based on available pmts with significantly better quantum efficiency , compared to the pmts used in the waseda prototype . with a time resolution of 300 ps",
    ", one will be able to reduce the number of background events .",
    "a full scale tof pet , with an axial sensitive length of 24 cm , has been proposed by the waseda group ( see figure [ fig : fig59 ] ) @xcite .",
    "another proposal for a lxe tof pet was recently made by the grenoble group @xcite , applying a light division method to measure the position in the axial direction .",
    "however , the reported position resolution was only about 10 mm ( fwhm ) in the central region , not competitive with what is achieved in commercially available crystal pet .",
    "simulation results show much better performance , but unfortunately the large discrepancy is not understood or explained yet .",
    "clearly , more studies are required to establish lxe compton / tof detectors as an alternative to classical crystal pet systems .",
    "lxe based detectors require associated systems ( from cryogenics to gas handling and purification ) which are typically perceived as complex and costly , contributing to some reluctance in their use , especially as diagnostic tools in medicine . in the last few years ,",
    "however , many significant technological advances have resulted in large lxe detector systems operating for many months with excellent and stable performance . in particular , the lxe detectors deployed underground for dark matter searches ( see [ sec : dm ] ) have proven that long term stability , reliability , and also safety issues can be confidently solved .",
    "we have reviewed the current state - of - the - art in liquid xenon detectors and associated principles of operation and performance characteristics .",
    "we could not expand on many topics to the extent we would have liked , yet we have attempted to gather the most relevant information from past and recent experimental work on liquid xenon detectors developed for a variety of applications .",
    "it is our wish that this article may be a useful resource especially for the new generation of investigators who are turning with enthusiasm to this material for the detection and measurement of different particles in different fields .",
    "recent years have seen an increased interest in liquid xenon detectors and an aggressive development of related technologies , driven by rare event searches from dark matter to neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the rate at which the performance of liquid xenon detectors has improved in the last ten years is very encouraging . yet",
    ", much work remains to be done in many areas , including a better understanding of the response of lxe to low energy particles and of the factors affecting the energy resolution .",
    "as the scale of some of these experiments grows , so does the challenge to push the performance limit in order to improve the detection sensitivity .",
    "additional challenges for multi - ton scale lxe detectors will be associated with the availability of xenon , its cost and purification .",
    "the next ten years will bring to fruition many of the ongoing experiments and others now in the planning phase .",
    "we are confident that these will make far - reaching contributions to some of the most important questions in physics today .",
    "it is also encouraging to see a rapid development of liquid xenon detectors for improved imaging in medicine , a practical application benefiting society as a whole .",
    "we would like to thank the many colleagues who share our passion for this topic and who have contributed to the advancement of liquid xenon detectors .",

    "<S> this article reviews the progress made over the last 20 years in the development and applications of liquid xenon detectors in particle physics , astrophysics and medical imaging experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with a summary of the fundamental properties of liquid xenon as radiation detection medium , in light of the most current theoretical and experimental information . after a brief introduction of the different type of liquid xenon detectors , we continue with a review of past , current and future experiments using liquid xenon to search for rare processes and to image radiation in space and in medicine . </S>",
    "<S> we will introduce each application with a brief survey of the underlying scientific motivation and experimental requirements , before reviewing the basic characteristics and expected performance of each experiment . within this decade </S>",
    "<S> it appears likely that large volume liquid xenon detectors operated in different modes will contribute to answering some of the most fundamental questions in particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology , fulfilling the most demanding detection challenges . from experiments like meg , currently the largest liquid xenon scintillation detector in operation , dedicated to the rare `` @xmath0 e@xmath1 '' decay , to the future xmass which also exploits only liquid xenon scintillation to address an ambitious program of rare event searches , to the class of time projection chambers like xenon and exo which exploit both scintillation and ionization of liquid xenon for dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay , respectively , we anticipate unrivaled performance and important contributions to physics in the next few years . </S>"
