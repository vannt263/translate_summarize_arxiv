    "ultrafast switching of polarization in ferroelectrics is of great interest for potential application in non - volatile memory devices .",
    "flash memories , which at present are the most commonly used non - volatile memory devices , have an operating speed of milliseconds .",
    "because of their slow speed , they are not considered as candidates for future memory applications @xcite .",
    "other emerging non - volatile memory technologies that utilize phase or resistance change have write and erase times of nanoseconds . therefore , development of a switching mechanism at sub - picosecond timescales has the potential to revolutionize the field .",
    "non - destructive readout of the electric polarization at sub - picosecond timescales has recently been demonstrated by analyzing the thz pulse waveforms radiated after illumination of a ferroelectric sample by femtosecond laser pulses at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this makes ferroelectric materials an exciting prospect for memory applications if switching can be achieved at similarly ultrashort timescales .",
    "ferroelectric materials exhibit remnant polarization even at zero external electric field because the cations and anions in these materials are asymmetrically displaced in the equilibrium structure . to switch the polarization ,",
    "the relative displacement between the cations and anions need to be reversed .",
    "this can be achieved by applying a ( quasi-)static electric field because such an electric field imparts a unidirectional force to the cations and anions . an arbitrary light pulse",
    ", whose oscillating electric field integrates to zero by definition , imparts a zero total force to the electric dipole present in the material .",
    "therefore , an ultrashort light pulse can not in general be used to switch the polarization of a ferroelectric material .",
    "nevertheless , there have been several proposals for switching the polarization of ferroelectric materials using ultrashort light pulses by controlling their soft phonon modes@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i propose a method for using mid - infrared pulses that are resonant with the highest frequency infrared - active phonon mode of a perovskite transition - metal oxide ferroelectric to switch its polarization .",
    "this involves controlling the dynamical degrees of freedom of the lattice and requires four main ingredients .",
    "first , i notice that there always exists a low frequency fully symmetric @xmath0 phonon mode in the ferroelectric phase that involves the motion of the cations and anions of the material in a way that changes the electric polarization .",
    "second , i find that this phonon mode couples to the highest frequency infrared - active @xmath0 phonon mode of the material with a large @xmath3 coupling , where @xmath4 is the coupling constant and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the normal mode coordinates of the lowest frequency and highest frequency @xmath0 normal mode coordinates , respectively .",
    "third , i find from first principles calculations that the sign of the coupling is such that the excitation of the highest frequency @xmath0 mode provides a displacive force along the @xmath5 normal mode coordinate in the direction that switches the polarization .",
    "fourth , i find that the @xmath5 mode has a strong @xmath2 order anharmonicity , which facilitates an abrupt switch of electric polarization as the @xmath6 amplitude is continuously increased .",
    "coherent displacement along raman mode coordinates utilizing nonlinear phonon couplings by resonantly exiting the highest frequency infrared mode of various centrosymmetric oxides has previously been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "therefore , the method proposed here to switch ferroelectric polarization at ultrafast timescales using mid - infrared pulses is experimentally feasible .",
    "i illustrate the proposed mechanism for the case of pbtio@xmath7 .",
    "the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors and the nonlinear couplings between two phonon modes were obtained using density functional theory calculations with plane - wave basis sets and projector augmented wave pseudopotentials @xcite as implemented in the vasp software package @xcite .",
    "the interatomic force constants were calculated using the frozen - phonon method @xcite , and the phonopy software package was used to calculate the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "total energy calculations were then performed as a function of the lowest frequency @xmath5 and high - frequency @xmath6 coordinates to obtain energy surfaces .",
    "the nonlinear couplings between the two modes were obtained by fitting the calculated energy surface to the polynomial shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : energy ] .",
    "i used the experimental values of @xmath8 = 3.9039 and @xmath9 = 4.1348   for the tetragonal lattice parameters but relaxed the atomic positions .",
    "the calculations were performed within the local density approximation .",
    "a cut - off of 600 ev was used for the plane - wave basis set expansion , and an @xmath10 @xmath11-point grid was used in the brillouin zone integration .",
    ".[tab : freq ] the zone - center phonon frequencies and their irreducible representation and optical activity of ferroelectric pbtio@xmath7 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the energy surface is also asymmetric in the @xmath6 coordinate because of the presence of odd order terms .",
    "the presence of both even and odd order terms is consistent with the fact that this high frequency mode also has the @xmath0 representation that does not break any crystal symmetry and is both infrared and raman active .",
    "although the energy surface is asymmetric in the @xmath6 coordinate , both positive and negative @xmath6 displacements move the minimum of the @xmath5 coordinate towards the negative direction .",
    "a negative value of @xmath6 displaces the lattice towards the negative @xmath5 direction by a modest amount .",
    "however , a positive value of @xmath6 does not continuously shift the energy minimum along the negative @xmath5 direction .",
    "it raises the energy curve near @xmath12 and creates an energy minimum at a large negative value of the @xmath5 coordinate such that a state with reversed polarization is energetically favored .",
    "this abrupt shift of the minimum of the @xmath5 mode is due to the presence of a large @xmath13 term .",
    "if the oscillations along the @xmath6 coordinate are integrated out , the average potential experienced by the lattice has a minimum at a negative value of the @xmath5 coordinate with the magnitude of the displacement along @xmath5 coordinate depending on the integration cut - off ( i.e. , the amplitude of the @xmath6 oscillations ) .",
    "this is because the coupling constant @xmath4 of the term @xmath14 has the largest magnitude , and it implies that the lattice will experience a large unidirectional force @xmath15 along the @xmath5 coordinate when the @xmath6 mode is being driven .",
    "furthermore , a large @xmath13 term ensures that the displacement of the lattice along the @xmath5 coordinate abruptly increases as the @xmath6 amplitude is continuously increased , which causes the electric polarization to switch discontinuously .    we can achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of the lattice when the @xmath6 mode is pumped externally by a mid - infrared pulse by treating the @xmath5 and @xmath6 modes as classical oscillators and studying their coupled equations of motion . in this picture , the two oscillators experience a force deriving from the calculated energy surface , and the @xmath6 mode is additionally driven by a term @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the amplitude , width , and frequency of the mid - infrared pulse , respectively . by treating the expression in eq .",

    "the results from numerical integration of the coupled equation of motions for different pump amplitudes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] . in these calculations ,",
    "i have used a pump pulse with a symmetric gaussian profile and a width of @xmath21 fs , which correspond to typical pump pulses used in mid - infrared excitations @xcite",
    ". a pump frequency of @xmath22 was used in the simulations , which is chosen to be slightly off - resonance with the frequency of the @xmath6 mode to demonstrate that this method is efficacious even if the pump pulse is not precisely resonant with the @xmath6 mode .    even for small",
    "pump amplitudes that cause a change in the ti  apical o distances of a few percent along the @xmath6 coordinate , the @xmath5 mode oscillates at a displaced position in the negative @xmath5 direction ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn](a ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of the @xmath1 coupling presented in refs .   and .",
    "in ref .  , it was shown that the @xmath5 mode experiences an effective force @xmath23 when the @xmath6 mode is pumped by an external driving term @xmath24 , and the time average of this forcing field has a rectified non - zero value .",
    "the oscillation of the @xmath5 mode at a rectified position is also seen in the fourier transform of the time evolution of the @xmath5 mode at positive time delays as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn](a ) .",
    "the fourier transform shows a peak at zero frequency that is due to the displacement of the lattice along the @xmath5 coordinate .",
    "in addition , there is a peak at @xmath25 and a negligible presence of higher - harmonics , which shows that the dynamics of the coupled oscillators are determined by the @xmath1 term , and other nonlinearities only play a marginal role at small pump amplitudes . at small pump amplitudes ,",
    "the displacement along the negative direction in the @xmath5 coordinate is small .",
    "therefore , although the electric polarization is reduced , the reversal of the polarization has not occurred .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the cubic terms in the energy potential @xmath13 and @xmath26 are large .",
    "these also impart unidirectional forces @xmath27 and @xmath28 to their respective coordinates when the amplitude of the oscillations are large , and the lattice will be rectified along these coordinates for the reasons described in the previous paragraph . from my first principles calculations of the energy surface , i find that the coefficients of these terms are such that the lattice is rectified along the direction that reverses the electric polarization .    as the pump amplitude",
    "is increased , the effects of the abovementioned nonlinearities start to become noticeable .",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath5 mode start to show higher frequency components due to the presence of various nonlinear terms .",
    "further increase of the pump amplitude takes the dynamics to a highly nonlinear regime . in this regime",
    ", the frequency at which the @xmath5 mode oscillates also changes .",
    "interestingly , there are two different mechanisms that change the effective frequency of the @xmath5 mode .",
    "first , a large amplitude oscillation of the @xmath5 mode causes a change in the effective spring constant due to the @xmath29 nonlinearity in the energy potential . in the equation of motion",
    ", this nonlinearity acts to modify the frequency of the @xmath5 mode with a term @xmath30 .",
    "the effective frequency @xmath31 changes because the time - averaged @xmath32 has a value different from @xmath25 when the @xmath5 amplitude is large .",
    "the rectification of the lattice along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 coordinates provides the second cause for the modification of the effective frequency .",
    "for example , the rectification along the @xmath5 coordinate changes the effective frequency to @xmath33 due to the @xmath13 term in the energy potential .",
    "the @xmath34 term in the energy potential similarly changes the effective frequency as @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig : dyn](b ) shows the results of the numerical integration of the equations of motion for a pump amplitude that rectifies the lattice close to a point where the polarization switches . near the polarization reversal , the slope of the potential for the @xmath5 mode is less steep , and the @xmath5 mode oscillates at a smaller frequency . in this regime ,",
    "the pumped @xmath6 mode is oscillating at a displaced position with an amplitude that changes the two ti - apical o bond lengths by 0.4 and 0.7  .",
    "these are large amplitude oscillations , but they are comparable to the change in the ti - apical o distance of 0.6   when a polarization switch occurs .",
    "[ fig : dyn](c ) illustrates the case where the lattice moves to a far distance in the negative direction along the @xmath5 coordinate , and this signals that the polarization has been switched .",
    "the pump strength used in this instance causes the @xmath6 mode to oscillate at a displaced position with an amplitude that changes the two ti - apical o bond lengths by 0.5 and 0.8  . in this regime ,",
    "the oscillations about the displaced position exhibit a strong nonlinear behavior with the presence of a wide range of frequency components . nevertheless , the frequency component that has the largest spectral weight stiffens once the displacement along @xmath5 coordinate advances through the point of polarization reversal , although the frequency is still smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "i find that the displacement along the @xmath5 coordinate shows a sudden jump when the externally pumped @xmath6 amplitude is continuously increased .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of the energy potential discussed above where a large @xmath13 term causes an abrupt change in the position of the minimum of the @xmath5 mode as @xmath6 is continuously increased . as a function of the pump amplitude ,",
    "the displacement along the @xmath5 coordinate continuously increases from a value of zero to @xmath36@xmath371.5 @xmath38 .",
    "however , a further increase of the pump amplitude causes the @xmath5 mode to oscillate about a displaced position of @xmath36@xmath379.0 @xmath38 .",
    "this indicates that the electric polarization switches in an abrupt , discontinuous manner when the @xmath6 mode is externally pumped .",
    "such a behavior can also be gleaned from the change in the frequency of the @xmath5 mode as the polarization reversal happens .",
    "i find that the frequency of the @xmath5 mode decreases by up to 60% as it is displaced along this coordinate .",
    "but it does not soften completely to zero as the polarization switch occurs and the frequency starts to increase again .",
    "in the study presented here , nonlinear couplings between two phonon modes and their dynamics when the higher frequency mode is externally pumped has been used to predict that ferroelectric materials can be switched using mid - infrared pulses . however , in real materials there are additional dynamical degrees of freedom , and this has two main implications .",
    "first , scattering with other degrees of freedom will cause the phonon modes to be damped .",
    "therefore , the rectifying force along the @xmath5 coordinate exists only as long as the @xmath6 mode is being externally pumped .",
    "second , other degrees of freedom also respond to the displacement of the lattice along the @xmath5 coordinate .",
    "if the pump pulse is long enough , other degrees of freedom relax relative to the switched state , and this forms an energy barrier that prevents the lattice to move back to the initial state even in the absence of the pump . a more detailed theoretical study based on molecular dynamics simulations",
    "would be required to ascertain the time it would take to form the energy barrier .    as mentioned above , i performed a full relaxation of the lattice starting from a structure that corresponds to a @xmath5 displacement of @xmath378.0 @xmath38 and found that the lattice indeed relaxes to the symmetrically equivalent switched state .",
    "the relaxation of the whole lattice to the symmetrically equivalent state with reversed polarization provides a mechanism for repeated switching because the lattice again experiences a unidirectional force in the switching direction along the @xmath5 coordinate when the lattice is excited anew by mid - infrared pulse .",
    "in addition to pbtio@xmath7 , i investigated the nonlinear couplings between the lowest and highest frequency @xmath0 modes of batio@xmath7 and linbo@xmath7 .",
    "i find a large @xmath1 coupling between the lowest frequency @xmath0 mode ( @xmath5 ) and the highest frequency @xmath0 mode ( @xmath6 ) in these materials as well .",
    "the sign of the coupling is such that the electric polarization of these materials could also be switched by pumping the @xmath6 mode with a mid - infrared pulse .",
    "therefore , the method illustrated here seems applicable in general to all perovskite transition - metal oxide ferroelectrics .",
    "in summary , i have illustrated that the polarization of pbtio@xmath7 can be switched by exciting the highest frequency infrared active @xmath0 phonon mode of this material with a mid - infrared pulse .",
    "a large amplitude oscillation of this mode provides a unidirectional force along the lowest frequency @xmath0 phonon mode coordinate due to a nonlinear coupling of the type @xmath1 .",
    "a displacement of the lattice along the @xmath5 coordinate changes the electric polarization and can bring the system near the symmetrically equivalent switched state . from my first principles calculations ,",
    "i find that sign of the coupling is such that the oscillations of the @xmath6 mode displaces the lattice along the @xmath5 coordinate in the switching direction .",
    "i also find that the switching occurs discontinuously because of the presence of a large @xmath13 term in the energy potential , which abruptly moves the minimum of the @xmath5 mode as the @xmath1 term gets continuously larger .",
    "in addition to pbtio@xmath7 , i find the presence of a similar @xmath1 coupling and a large @xmath13 anharmonicity in batio@xmath7 and linbo@xmath7 , and this type of nonlinear coupling seems to be universally present in perovskite transition - metal oxide ferroelectrics .",
    "therefore , a selective excitation of the @xmath6 mode using a mid - infrared pulse can be a general method to switch the polarization of perovskite transition - metal oxide ferroelectrics .",
    "i am indebted to yannis laplace for valuable discussions .",
    "i also acknowledge antoine georges , roman mankowsky , srivats rajasekaran , and andrea cavalleri for helpful comments and discussions ."
