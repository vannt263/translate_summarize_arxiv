    "a voyage inside the black hole ( bh ) event horizon may be not finished in the central singularity after a finite proper time of the traveler , but once again outside the event horizon . however , due to the complicated internal bh geometry @xcite , it would be an emergence in the _ other _ universe rather than a return to the traveler s native one .",
    "is it possible to live long inside the bh avoiding both the downfall to the central singularity and escaping to another universe ? to clarify this possibility we suppose that bh interiors are described by the kerr - newman metric with a maximally extended global geometry @xcite . these bhs are named the eternal ones .",
    "the corresponding carter - penrose conformal diagram of the eternal black is an infinite stairway of asymptotically flat space - times , connected by the one - way einstein - rosen bridges .",
    "the entries and outlets of these einstein - rosen bridges are , respectively , the event horizons of the black and white holes .",
    "we demonstrate below that living inside the eternal bhs is possible in principle , if these bhs are rotating or charged and massive enough for weakening the tidal forces and radiation of gravitational waves to acceptable level .",
    "a tidal acceleration experienced by the object ( e.g. , some creature ) with a linear size @xmath0 at a distance @xmath1 from a black hole with mass @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath3 ( see e.g. chapter 32.6 in @xcite ) .",

    ", a traveler will appear in the @xmath15-region @xcite , where his radial coordinate @xmath1 would become a temporal one and inevitably diminishing towards the central singularity .",
    "the irresistible infall in the @xmath15-region will finish soon after traversing the inner cauchy horizon at @xmath16 , which is nonzero for the rotating or charged bh .",
    "the internal space - time domain @xmath17 between the central singularity and the inner bh horizon is the @xmath18-region , where stationary observers may exist just as anywhere on the planet earth .",
    "this internal bh domain , hidden by the two horizons from the whole external universe , is indeed a suitable place for safe inhabitation .",
    "the only thing needed is to put your vehicle or your planet to a stable periodic orbit inside bh .",
    "we discuss some specific properties of stable periodic orbits of planets and photons inside the rotating charged bh , described by the kerr - newman metric .",
    "it is supposed that generic properties of the kerr - newman metric are survived inside black holes in spite of a threat from the perturbative instabilities @xcite .",
    "the most generic description for the motion of particles in the gravitational field of the black holes is a test particle approximation .",
    "this approximation is self - consistent , if particles are small and light enough with respect to , respectively , the characteristic size and mass of the black hole , so that the back reaction can be neglected .",
    "the term `` test planets '' is used throughout the paper as a synonym of the `` test particles '' .",
    "subramanyan chandrasekhar @xcite designated two general types of test particle orbits in the bh gravitational field : orbits of the _ first kind _ , which are completely confined outside the bh event horizon , and orbits of the _ second kind _ , which penetrate inside the bh . here we also propose to distinguish orbits of a _ third kind _ , which are completely bound inside the bh , not escaping outside , nor infalling into the central singularity .",
    "the bound orbits of the third kind inside the inner bh horizon were found by ji   bik , zdenk stuchlk and vladimr balek @xcite for charged particles around the rotating charged bhs ( see also @xcite ) and by eva hackmann , claus lmmerzahl , valeria kagramanova and jutta kunz @xcite for neutral particles around rotating bhs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the bound orbits of the third kind are periodic and stable if gravitational and electromagnetic radiation is neglected .",
    "geodesics equations for neutral test particles and photons and equations of motion for charged particles in the kerr - newman metric were derived by b. carter @xcite . according to these equations the motion of test particle with a mass @xmath19 and electric charge @xmath20 in the background gravitational field of a bh with a mass @xmath2 , angular momentum @xmath21 and electric charge @xmath22",
