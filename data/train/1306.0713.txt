    "recent technical advances in the atomic - scale growth of transition metal oxide ( tmo ) heterostructures have created considerable research interest @xcite . in tmo heterostructures , multiple degrees of freedom ( _ i.e. _ , charge , spin , orbital , lattice ) are coupled to each other , often creating novel material characteristics such as high - temperature superconductivity and colossal magneto resistence @xcite .",
    "using atomic - scale techniques to fabricate artificial tmo heterostructures makes it possible to control those degrees of freedom and band structures , and therefore to create or design new ` correlated electron ' properties .",
    "previous tmo superlattice studies @xcite have shown that many unexpected material phenomena can be realized at the tmo heterointerface , such as magnetism and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "when combined with other degrees of freedom , charge doping can play a significant role in determining material properties of tmo heterostructures .",
    "sometimes extra charges are introduced in an unexpected and uncontrolled way .",
    "for example , oxygen vacancies often drives a tmo system to exhibit fairly different material characteristics ( _ e.g. , _ driving an insulating material to be metallic ) @xcite .",
    "cation inter - mixing can also be important , as it introduces a different local ionic potential to the nearby atoms ( _ e.g. , _ the inter - mixing of sr@xmath3 and la@xmath4 ) .",
    "it is also possible to control the amount of extra charges by chemical doping or electric field , for example .",
    "considering all these possibilities , it is important to understand the effect of charge doping in tmo heterostructures . in particular , the relation between the rotation of metal - oxygen octahedra and charge doping has never been investigated in a systematic way .    among the various tmos ,",
    "rare - earth nickelate compounds @xmath5nio@xmath0 , where @xmath5 denotes rare - earth elements , show interesting properties .",
    "the @xmath5nio@xmath0 series exhibit a range of transitions , from the `` correlated metal '' phase of lanio@xmath0 to charge - ordered insulating states as the ionic @xmath5 becomes smaller and more octahedral distortion is introduced@xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the systematic dependence of the transition temperature @xmath6 with respect to the ionic size of @xmath5 implies strong coupling between the structural and electronic degrees of freedom . in this regard , introducing reduced dimensionality through the synthesis of nickelate compound heterostructures can be another promising way to control the material properties and realize emergent physics in this system@xcite .",
    "indeed , it has recently been reported that lanio@xmath0 , which is a paramagnetic metal in the bulk phase , shows insulating behavior with magnetic order in a superlattice@xcite .",
    "there have been a number of subsequent studies about nickelate heterostructures@xcite , which show a potential for rich physics , but there has not been systematic studies about the effect of doping in these systems yet .    in this paper , we examine the effect of doping on the nickelate superlattice by taking ( lanio@xmath0)@xmath7/(srtio@xmath0)@xmath7 as a prototype example @xcite .",
    "we employed first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations augmented with mean - field treatment of on - site coulomb interaction , the so - called dft+@xmath8 methodology , to consider the role of electron correlations inherent in the ni @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "the behavior of the electronic structure , orbital polarization , magnetism , and structural distortion with respect to the amount of charge doping is examined , and the effect of coulomb interaction is also discussed .",
    "we pay our special attention to the orbital order within the ni @xmath9 states and the structural responses to it .",
    "two different structural settings have been considered : ( i ) the calculations in which only tetragonal distortions of nio@xmath2 octahedra ( elongation or contration of ni  o bond length along the normal direction to the superlattice plane ) are allowed and ( ii ) the full nio@xmath2 octahedral distorion including rotation and jahn - teller distortion . in the first set ,",
    "we investigate how the doping - induced change of orbital polarization affects the nio@xmath2 octahedra .",
    "the relation between the octahedral rotation pattern and the local distortion is examined with the second sets .",
    "hereafter we call the first and the second sets as the ` tetragonally - distorted ' and ` fully - distorted ' cells , respectively .",
    "systematic changes are found : as electrons are introduced , the orbital polarization ( _ i.e. , _ the relative occupation of @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) is reduced , and the ni to apical oxygen distance is enhanced .",
    "the evolution of the octahedral rotation angles also exhibits a systematic tendency on charge doping .",
    "our results suggest a possibility to control the structural property as well as the electronic structure by doping , and provides useful information to understand the experiments under the various types of doping situations .    after presenting the computational details in sec .",

    "[ fig : mag](a ) ) for @xmath75 0 and 3 ev .",
    "however in this case , the half - metallic phase is obtained in the calculation of + 0.50@xmath24-cell with @xmath43 3 ev .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase disappears as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd](b ) due to the reduction of @xmath31 in the fully distorted cells .",
    "the reduction of @xmath31 also enlarges the area of the half - metallic phase in @xmath76 4 ev . in the electron - doped regime of the half - metallic phase ,",
    "the magnetic moments on the two inequivalent ni atoms reflect the charge disproportionation on the ni sites .",
    "the doping simulated by the rigid band shift can not be the same as what happens in real experimental situations , such an oxygen vacancies .",
    "for example , oxygen vacancies not only introduces effective electron doping , but also distorts the local structure by disconnecting the metal  oxygen  metal network .",
    "however , we note that the two different approaches , which incorporate the charge doping in our calculations , produce consistent results regarding the change of the electronic structure , orbital polarization and structural property . also , the orbital polarization is insensitive to some degrees of structural difference .",
    "these findings strongly suggest that the overall conclusions presented in this study are quite relevant to various doping situations in experiments , in spite of the limitation of the simulation methods .",
    "we emphasize that our results can provide useful information for understanding texperiments .",
    "for example , the further distortion of rotated oxygen octahedra caused by doping implies that additional oxygen vacancies do not necessarily lead the system to be more metallic , because further rotation can simultaneously make the system be less metallic due to the enlarged effective @xmath77 parameter .",
    "also , our prediction of polarization dependence as a function of electron doping can be tested in experiments , for example by changing the oxygen partial pressure in the pulsed laser deposition process .",
    "similar doping - induced structural changes may happen in other oxide superlattices with @xmath13-orbital degrees of freedom , such as the latio@xmath0/laalo@xmath0 system .",
    "one may also speculate the possibility of rich phases from the lanio@xmath0/latio@xmath0 superlattices , where the two independent orbital degrees of freedom from the ti-@xmath42 and ni-@xmath9 can interact through corner - sharing coupling of the nio@xmath2 and tio@xmath2 octahedra .",
    "such materials as well as other relevant systems may have substantial importance and deserve further theoretical investigation .",
    "the effect of charge doping on the electronic , orbital and structural properties in lanio@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 has been investigated using first - principles density functional theory calculation , in which doping was simulated with two different methods , namely , rigid band shift and the cation - substituted calculation .",
    "the results clearly show the systematic dependence of these physical properties on doping . as more electrons",
    "are introduced , the orbital polarization is reduced and the ni to apical oxygen distance significantly increases .",
    "these features are found in both tetragonally distorted and the fully distorted results .",
    "remarkably , the rotation angles of the nio@xmath2/tio@xmath2 octahedra are also found to strongly depend on doping .",
    "our results suggest a possible way to control orbital and structural property by means of charge doping , and provide useful information to understand the experimental results under various doping situations , such as oxygen vacancies .",
