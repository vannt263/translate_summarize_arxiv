    "there are several `` universal '' equations that are widely physical applicable and have remarkable mathematical properties ( see e.g. , refs .",

    "such `` universal '' equations are very often obtained with the help of some asymptotic approach , for example , with the help of the reductive perturbation method ( see e.g. , refs .",
