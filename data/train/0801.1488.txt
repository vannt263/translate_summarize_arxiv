    "the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centres of all galaxies which have stellar bulges is nowadays widely accepted by the astronomy comunity @xcite . according to this scenario",
    "the energy emitted by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is due to the accretion of material onto the smbh and implies the presence of a gas reservoir close to the agn .",
    "@xcite using archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) optical images for a large sample of early - type galaxies with and without agns , found that all agn hosts have circumnuclear gas and dust , while this is observed in only 26% of a pair - matched sample of inactive galaxies .",
    "a gas reservoir close to the agn is also supported by the presence of recent star formation in the circumnuclear region of active galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the strongest signatures that feeding to the smbh is occurring include the observation of streaming motions in ionized gas along nuclear spirals towards the nucleus of nearby active galaxies using two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical spectroscopy @xcite .    streaming motions as feeding signatures to the nuclear region",
    "have been previously observed in radio wavelengths .",
    "@xcite , for example , have found streaming motions towards the center along the spiral arms of m81 in hi , while @xcite have found similar streaming motions towards the nucleus along the weak bar of ngc4151 .",
    "closer to the center , most of the gas is in the molecular phase , and co observations have been used to map the gas kinematics and inflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "molecular hydrogen emission lines are also relatively strong in the near - ir @xmath3-band spectra of active galaxies , and previous studies suggest that its distribution and kinematics is distinct from that observed in the other emission lines , which are usually dominated by outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the seyfert galaxies",
    "ngc2110 and circinus , for example , @xcite have found broader emission - line profiles for [ feii ] and pa@xmath14 than for the h@xmath152.1218@xmath4 m emission - line in a study using near - ir long - slit observations , suggesting a stronger influence of nuclear outflows on the former emission lines and a different origin for the h@xmath9 emitting gas , consistent with the colder kinematics of the galaxy disk .",
    "more recently , using two - dimensional ( hereafter 2d ) near - ir spectroscopy of the seyfert galaxy eso428-g14 , we @xcite have found that the h@xmath9 emission distribution was mostly restricted to the plane of the galaxy and was less affected by the agn outflow than the [ feii ] and pa@xmath14 emission lines .    in this paper",
    "we use adaptive optics ifu spectroscopic data obtained with the gemini s near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs - * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the near - ir @xmath3-band at a sampling of 0@xmath161@xmath10@xmath161 , to investigate the stellar and gaseous kinematics of the inner @xmath17arcsec@xmath2 of the nearby active galaxy ngc4051 .",
    "the stellar kinematics will be used to constrain the galaxy potential and mass of the smbh , but our main goal is to look for signatures of feeding mechanisms at parsec scales through the h@xmath9 kinematics .",
    "ngc4051 is a sabbc galaxy at a distance of only @xmath09.3mpc@xcite , such that 1@xmath160 corresponds to 45pc at the galaxy .",
    "it harbors one of the closest agn , classified as a narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) .",
    "we have selected ngc4051 for this study partially on the basis of the recent work of @xcite , who obtained 2d stellar kinematics using the ifu of the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) to observe the stellar absorption lines of the calcium triplet around 8500 .",
    "these authors have shown that the turnover of the stellar rotation curve occurs at only @xmath1850pc from the nucleus , indicating that the stellar motions are dominated by a highly concentrated gravitational potential .",
    "as nifs with the altair adaptive optics module provides a much better image sampling and resolution than the gmos - ifu , we decided to further investigate the kinematics of the nuclear region of ngc4051 in order to better constrain the gravitational potential and the mass of the smbh . in adition , this galaxy shows strong h@xmath9 emission @xcite , making it a good candidate for a study of its kinematics .",
    "previous studies of ngc4051 include hst narrow - band [ oiii ] images which show an unresolved nuclear source and faint extended emission ( by 12 ) along the position angle pa=100@xmath19 @xcite , the approximate direction of the alignment of two radio components at 6 cm separated by 0@xmath164 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the profiles of optical forbidden emission lines present blue wings reaching velocities of up to 800kms@xmath6 , and proposed a model for the narrow - line region ( hereafter nlr ) with outflows and obscuring dust .",
    "evidence for outflows have also been observed by @xcite for the [ oiii ] emission to 15 ne of the nucleus .",
    "@xcite using the [ fex]@xmath206374 emission line report a high ionization region extending to 3@xmath160  se of the nucleus .",
    "@xcite found a x - ray variability on time scales of the order of 1 hour and @xcite reported flux changes by a factor of 2 in 6 months observed at 2.2@xmath4 m and suggest that emission by dust reprocessing of the uv radiation from the nucleus is an acceptable explanation .",

    "the ifu spectroscopic data were obtained with nifs operating with the altair adaptive optics module on the 8-m gemini north telescope in january 2006 under the instrument science verification program gn-2006a - sv-123 .",
    "the ifu has a square field of view of @xmath21 , divided into 29 slices with an angular sampling of 0@xmath161@xmath10@xmath1604 .",
    "the observing procedures followed the standard object - sky - sky - object dither sequence , with off - source sky positions since the target is extended , and individual exposure times of 750s centered at @xmath22 m .",
    "two set of observations , each with three individual exposures , were obtained at different spatial positions ; the first one centered at the position 0@xmath164 from the nucleus along the pa@xmath23 and the second at a position offset 0@xmath165 along pa@xmath24 .",
    "the longest extent covered by the ifu observations was oriented along the position angle pa@xmath24 , which corresponds to the orientation of the line of nodes derived by modelling of the stellar velocity field with a rotating disk @xcite .",
    "we have used the @xmath25 grating and the filter @xmath26 , which resulted in an arc lamp line full width at half maximuum ( fwhm ) of 3.2 .",
    "the data reduction was accomplished using tasks contained in the nifs package which is part of gemini iraf package as well as generic iraf tasks .",
    "the reduction procedure included trimming of the images , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength and s - distortion calibrations .",
    "we have also removed the telluric bands and flux calibrated the frames by interpolating a black body function to the spectrum of the telluric standard star .",
    "the final ifu data cube contains 1160 spectra , each spectrum corresponding to an angular coverage of 0@xmath161@xmath10@xmath161 , which translates into 4.5@xmath14.5pc@xmath2 at the galaxy and covering the spectral region from 1.991@xmath27 m to 2.425@xmath27 m .",
    "the total observed field of view 2@xmath169@xmath14@xmath160 ( obtained by mosaicing the two set of observations ) thus corresponds to a region of projected dimensions 130pc@xmath1180pc at the galaxy .    in the top - left panel of fig.[espectro ]",
    "we present a large scale @xmath3-band image from @xcite obtained at the william hershel telescope ( wht ) , the central rectangle shows the ifu field of view .",
    "the large scale image was rotated to the same orientation of the ifu observations . in the top - right panel",
    "we present an image obtained from the nifs data cube for the 2.12@xmath27 m continuum emission , obtained by interpolation of the continuum under the h@xmath13 m emission line . in the bottom panels we present three charateristic ifu spectra : the nuclear spectrum ( position n in the continuum map ) , a spectrum from a location at 12 e of the nucleus ( position a ) and another from 075 w of the nucleus ( position b ) .",
    "both spectra correspond to an aperture of 0@xmath163@xmath10@xmath163 .",
    "the emission lines are identified in the nuclear spectrum : the h@xmath9 lines at @xmath282.0338 , 2.1218 and 2.2235@xmath4 m , the hi br@xmath10 at 2.1661@xmath4 m and the [ caviii ] coronal emission line at 2.3211@xmath4 m .",
    "the @xmath29co and @xmath30co absorption bandheads used to obtain the stellar kinematics are identified in the spectrum from position a.",
    "in order to obtain the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) we have used the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite to fit the stellar absorptions present in the @xmath3-band spectra . the algorithm finds the best fit to a galaxy spectrum by convolving a template stellar spectrum with the corresponding losvd .",
    "this procedure gives as output the radial velocity , velocity dispersion and higher - order gauss - hermite moments .",
    "the ppxf method allows the use of several template stellar spectra and to vary the weights of the contribution of the different templates to obtain the best fit , minimizing the template mismatch problem .",
    "however , the use of ppxf requires templates which match closely the galaxy spectrum . @xcite",
    "present a extensive discussion about the use of the ppxf method and the templates mismatch problem and @xcite present a discussion about template mismatch for kinematic fitting using the co absorption bandheads in the near - ir .",
    "a high signal - to - noise ratio is required for reliable stellar kinematic measurements using the ppxf method . in previous works",
    "the data are usually binned to give s / n ratio between 40 and 60 over the whole field - of - view . in our data ,",
    "ratios smaller than these are observed only very close to the borders of the field ( s / n @xmath5 35 measured blueward of the first co band - head ) .",
    "our typical s / n ratios are 80 with maximuum values reaching 120 close to the nucleus , thus allowing reliable kinematic measurements without spatial binning of the data .      in this study we have selected as template spectra , those of the spectroscopic library of late spectral type stars observed with the gemini near infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) ifu using the grating 111 l / mm in the _ k_-band @xcite .",
    "this library is composed of spectra of 29 objects , which include dwarf , giant and sub - giant stars with spectral types from f7iii to m3iii , observed in the spectral range from 2.24 to 2.42@xmath4 m .",
    "of these , 23 stars were also observed on a second setting extending the wavelength coverage down to 2.15@xmath4 m .",
    "the spectra of the templates have signal - to - noise ratios larger than 50 blueward of the co2 - 0 first - overtone bandhead .",
    "detailed discussion about this library is presented by @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution of the stellar spectra is 3.3    very close to the spectral resolution of the nifs data , thus the library can be used to fit the stellar kinematics without any resolution correction .",
    "we have verified this in some tests using available nifs spectra of a few stars .",
    "we opted to use the gnirs library because there are too few available template spectra with nifs .",
    "we have chosen 16 stars from the library which better match the stellar features of ngc4051 . in order to investigate the influence of the stellar templates on the velocity dispersions",
    "obtained we have fitted the stellar kinematics using individual stars as templates .",
    "we observed that the large scale structures in @xmath31 maps are similar for all stars , but the mean @xmath31 values vary significantly  higher ews in the templates result in lower @xmath31 values for the galaxy .",
    "this result evidences the importance of using a large library of stellar templates in order to obtain reliable velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "the nuclear spectrum of ngc4051 ( fig.[espectro ] ) shows the coronal emission line of [ caviii ] at 2.3211@xmath27 m . @xcite",
    "have shown that this line affects the kinematic measurements obtained from the co bandheads . in order to investigate the influence of this line in our measurements , we have chosen two spectral regions to fit the stellar kinematics :",
    "the first one ( 2.258 - 2.372@xmath4 m ) includes the [ caviii ] line and the second ( 2.258 - 2.314@xmath4 m and 2.346 - 2.372@xmath4 m ) excludes this line ( together with the `` contaminated '' co bandhead ) .",
    "we observed that the radial velocities and velocity dispersions derived using the first spectral range are higher in the nuclear region , where the [ caviii ] emission line is present , than those obtained by using the second spectral region .",
    "we thus decided to exclude the contaminated @xmath29co3 - 1 bandhead from the stellar kinematics fitting in the region where the [ caviii ] emission line is present ( the central 08 radius ) . in regions away from the nucleus we used the first spectral range which includes the @xmath29co3 - 1 bandhead .              in fig.[fit",
    "] we show the fits of the stellar templates to the galaxy spectra with the program ppxf for four different positions : the nucleus ; 1@xmath162 se and 1@xmath162nw of the nucleus , where we observe the turnovers of the rotation curve and a location at 1@xmath165 e of the nucleus , almost at the border of the nifs field .",
    "we observe that the stellar templates fit very well the galaxy spectra at most positions , including regions near the border of the ifu field , where the signal - to - noise ratio is smaller .",
    "the results for the nucleus should nevertheless be considered with caution , as the fitting may have been affected by dust emission and emission lines present in the galaxy spectrum but absent in the stellar templates .        in fig.[stel ] we present the resulting stellar kinematics .",
    "the black regions in this figure are masker regions where the signal to noise ratio in the spectra was too low to provide a reliable fit . in the top - left panel",
    "we show the stellar velocity field , which shows a velocity range from @xmath32 to @xmath33kms@xmath6 with the turnover occurring at @xmath555pc from the nucleus in good agreement with the velocity field obtained by @xcite from optical ifu data .",
    "the mean uncertainties in the velocities are @xmath34 .",
    "the turnover and amplitude of the rotation curve can be more easily observed in the one dimensional cut of the stellar velocity field shown in fig.[corte ] .",

    "the highest values of @xmath36 are observed to se of the nucleus and the lowest values to nw of the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath37 values are nearly zero over most of the ifu field .      since the stellar velocity field",
    "is dominated by rotation , it was fitted with a velocity model produced by a plummer potential in order to obtain the systemic velocity , orientation of the line of nodes , bulge mass and the position of the kinematical center .",
    "the plummer potential is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a scale length , @xmath40 is the radial distance in the plane of the galaxy , @xmath41 is the mass inside @xmath40 and @xmath42 is the newton s gravitational constant . defining the coordinates of the kinematical center of the system as ( @xmath43 ) , the observed radial velocity at position ( @xmath44 ) , where @xmath45 is the projected radial distance from the nucleus in the plane of the sky and @xmath46 is the corresponding position angle ,",

    "we opted not to show slices in the br@xmath10 emission - line profile due to the fact that its narrow component is indeed narrow and quite symmetric , and close to the nucleus it is hard to deblend it from the broad line profile , which introduces too much uncertainty in the derived kinematics .",
    "as observed in the top - left panel of fig.[stel ] * and in fig.[corte ] * the turnover of the rotation curve occurs at only @xmath555pc from the nucleus , suggesting that the stellar motions are dominated by a highly concentrated gravitational potential .",
    "this is also supported by the small value obtained for the scale length ( @xmath87pc ) from the modelling of the velocity field .",
    "the derived parameters are in approximate agreement with the ones derived by @xcite from a similar modelling using optical ifu data for a field - of - view of @xmath885@xmath75 ( 315@xmath1225pc@xmath2 ) .",
    "the exception is our value of @xmath89 , which is @xmath90 larger than theirs . on the other hand ,",

    "we atribute these differences to the differences in field - of - view , considering also that our field - of - view , which corresponds to 130@xmath1180pc@xmath2 at the galaxy , is only sampling the stellar kinematics very close to the nucleus .    for an orientation of the line of nodes of @xmath89 , and assuming that the spiral arms of ngc4051 are trailing ( orientation of the arms is shown in fig.[espectro ] )",

    "a possible interpretation is that these patches are colder regions with more recent star formation than the underlying bulge .",
    "this is supported by optical spectra of the nuclear region which show clear signatures of intermediate age stars @xcite .",
    "a very small @xmath31 drop is observed right at the nucleus , but we take this result with caution because of the obvious contamination of the spectra of the nuclear region by emission from dust and broad emission lines .    we can estimate the mass of the smbh ( @xmath92 ) from the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath93 ) as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97kms@xmath6 @xcite . adopting @xmath98kms@xmath6 as representative of the bulge ( top right panel of fig.[stel ] ) , we obtain @xmath99m@xmath8 .",

    "the simultaneous observation of the stellar and gaseous kinematics allowed us to construct residual maps for the gaseous kinematics relative to the stellar kinematics model described in section[secplum ] .",
    "the residual map for the h@xmath9 emitting gas is presented in fig.[res ] .",
    "the most conspicous feature in this map is the elongated structure to the ne , which shows blueshifts of up to @xmath101100kms@xmath6 , also seen in the corresponding velocity slices in fig.[slices ]",
    ". these blueshifts could be either due to an inflow , if the gas is located in the plane , as the ne is the far side of the galaxy ; or to an outflow , if the gas is extended to high latitudes ( above the plane ) , e.g. in a conical structure oriented towards us .",
    "we discuss below these two possibilities .",
    "the outflow interpretation is supported by the following facts : ( 1 ) that the elongated ne structure is _ approximately _ oriented along the radio jet ; ( 2 ) a _ similar _ structure and blueshifts have been observed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* -hereafter b08 ) in ifu observations of [ siii]@xmath102 emitting gas , who found , in addition , redshifts to the sw , which appear to be due to a counterpart conical outflow related to the sw part of the radio - jet , probably located behind the galactic plane and being directed away from us ; ( 3 ) the velocity dispersion and line ratio maps which show increased values in regions close to the tips of the radio jet .",
    "the inflow interpretation is , on the other hand , supported by : ( 1 ) the fact that the orientation of the ne blueshifted region is not well aligned with the direction of the radio jet , but is shifted by @xmath005 to the s  se ( see fig.[slices ] ) ; ( 2 ) the fact that the blueshifted region is elongated and curved as if it belonged to a spiral arm ending at the nucleus , while the blueshifted structure observed in the [ siii]@xmath102 emitting gas by b08 shows a more conical shape whose axis is better aligned with the direction of the radio jet ; ( 3 ) the fact that there is no redshifted counterpart in h@xmath9 as observed for the [ siii ] emitting gas .",
    "there is instead a redshifted structure observed in the velocity slices ( see fig.[slices ] ) also curved as belonging to a spiral arm in the near side ( sw ) of the galaxy .",
    "considering the arguments above we favour the inflow interpretation .",
    "the blueshifts to the ne and redshifts to the sw observed in the h@xmath9 emitting gas would then be due to inflow of molecular gas in the galaxy plane along nuclear spiral arms .",
    "the presence of such arms is supported by the structure map of the nuclear region of ngc4051 presented by @xcite , which shows similar spiral structure with the same curvature and orientation of the arms in an hst optical image of the nuclear region of ngc4051 .",
    "the structure map also shows a lot of obscuration against the near side of the galaxy , which would explain why the flux of the redshifted gas emission is fainter than that of the blueshifted gas on the far side of the galaxy .",
    "the enhancements in the gas velocity dispersions and increase in line emission ratios observed in h@xmath9 and br@xmath10 emitting gas can be understood if the radio jet is launched at a relatively small angle to the galaxy plane compressing the circumnuclear ism close to the nucleus .    in a recent study aimed at investigating the interaction between the radio jet and line emission in the nlr of the seyfert galaxy eso428-g14 using gnirs ifu data we found a close association of the [ feii ] and hi emission line distributions and kinematics with the radio emission distribution @xcite",

    "was also found in a near - ir study of the gas emission around the nuclei of the seyfert galaxies ngc2110 and circicus @xcite .",
    "these studies thus also support our favored interpretation in the present study : most of the h@xmath9 emission is located in the plane and is not related to the outflow .",
    "it is instead , flowing towards the nucleus along spiral arms .    the br@xmath10 emitting gas is almost all at the systemic velocity as observed in the bottom - left panel of fig.[gas ] and seems to show no rotation , which leads us to conclude that most of the br@xmath10 emitting gas is not restricted to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "coronal lines are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species which extend from the unresolved nucleus up to distances between a few tens to a few hundreds of parsecs , and usually present blue wings and are broader than low ionization lines ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "thus , it is possible to resolve the coronal line region for the closest active galaxies . in ngc4051 , the [ caviii ] coronal emission line at 2.3211@xmath4 m is indeed resolved , presenting extended emission in a circular region around the nucleus with diameter of @xmath575pc .",
