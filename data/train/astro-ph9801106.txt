    "in this paper we examine the physics of neutrino emission in the collapse of supermassive stars",
    ". we also comment on the prospects for future terrestrial neutrino detectors to obtain a signal from these objects , and we discuss the possible consequences of such a signal for cosmology . by supermassive stars   we mean stars so massive that they collapse on the general relativistic feynman - chandrasekhar instability .",
    "this will imply masses for these objects @xmath1 ( see for example fuller , woosley , & weaver 1986 ; thereafter fww ) .    though there is no direct evidence for the existence of these objects",
    ", we note that there is overwhelming evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes both associated with quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at high redshift and almost every galaxy - sized structure examined appropriately by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( van der marel et al .",
    "in turn , begelman and rees ( 1978 ) have shown that a supermassive star could result as an intermediate stage in the collapse of a relativistic star cluster to a black hole .    alternatively , supermassive stars could have formed out of primordial clouds at high redshifts in which cooling was not as efficient as in clouds contaminated with metals ( hoyle & fowler 1963 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; fww ; mclaughlin & fuller 1996 ) .",
    "the typical baryonic jean s mass at high redshift can be @xmath2 ( peebles & dicke 1968 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ) , but we do not know whether a cloud of this size would fragment into many pieces and form stars of smaller masses or collapse directly to form a large object .",
    "given the relatively crude understanding we currently possess on star formation , it is interesting to explore the observational signatures of supermassive stars , one of which could be their neutrino emission during core collapse .",
    "( the other telltale signs of the existence and evolution history of supermassive stars could be nucleosynthesis products of hot hydrogen burning ( the @xmath3-process , wallace & woosley 1981 ) ; greatly enhanced local helium and/or deuterium abundances ( woosley 1977 ; fuller & shi 1997 ) ; or effects of large black holes . )",
    "it would be very significant for our understanding of galaxy formation and cosmology if there were to be a new neutrino or nucleosynthesis probe of the epoch of galaxy / quasar formation at redshifts @xmath41 to 5",
    ".    there are significant differences between neutrino emission in supermassive stars and in core collapse supernovae .",
    "neutrinos are trapped and thermalized in ordinary supernovae . because of the different depths inside the supernova core where the various neutrino species thermally decouple , the average neutrino energies satisfy the hierarchy @xmath5 . by contrast , in supermassive stars neutrinos are produced principally by annihilation of thermal @xmath6-pairs .",
    "they can escape freely from the core and so their energy spectra are not thermal and different neutrino species therefore will have similar energy spectra .",
    "the only known limit so far on the neutrino background from supermassive stars comes from the consideration that probably no more than @xmath7 of all baryons could ever have been in these objects , otherwise there would probably be too many @xmath8 to @xmath9 relic black holes .",
    "this limit is much less stringent than the limit on the supernova neutrino background .",
    "this supernova background limit can be obtained because the past and present supernova rates are subject to a very tight metallicity production constraint ( totani , sato & yoshii 1996 ; hartmann & woosley 1997 ; malaney 1997 ) .",
    "the abundance of supermassive stars may not be subject to similar metallicity concerns because these objects do not necessarily expel significant amounts of metals into the interstellar medium .",
    "however , while the supernova neutrino background has contributions from _ recent _ supernovae , the neutrino background from supermassive stars ( if any ) probably took its form at a higher redshift , and therefore suffers a fair amount of redshift in energy . consequently , although the relic neutrino flux of supermassive stars could be higher than the flux of relic supernova neutrinos , it has fewer neutrinos with energies in the range @xmath10 mev",
    ".    numerical calculation of neutrino emissivity from @xmath6 annihilation have been carried out previously ( schinder et al .",
    "1987 ; itoh et al .",
    "1989 ) . in this paper",
    "we apply these results to the calculation of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectra in the collapse of supermassive stars .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the flux and energy spectrum of the neutrino background from a putative population of supermassive stars as a function of their abundance and redshift , and their efficiency in converting gravitational energy into neutrino energy .",
    "we estimate the event rate of this neutrino background in several new - generation neutrino detectors , including super kamiokande ( super k ) .",
    "we will also consider the expected event rate of a single neutrino burst from the collapse of a single supermassive star .",
    "fuller , woosley , and weaver ( 1986 ) have discussed the evolution and general relativistic instability of supermassive stars . in that work",
    "it was shown that these objects will most likely collapse into black holes unless the centrifugal force resulting from rapid rotation is strong enough to compensate the build - up of infall kinetic energy . during the collapse , only part of the star will plunge through the event horizon and become a prompt   black hole . this is because the prodigious thermal neutrino pair emission will render the collapse of a nonrotating supermassive star non - homologous ( fww ; see also goldreich & weber 1980 ) .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath11 where superscript init   always refers to quantities in the initial pre - collapse configuration , and superscript hc   refers to quantities of the homologous core during the collapse . here",
    "@xmath12 is the stellar mass in units of 10@xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the statistical weight of relativistic particles , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; and @xmath17 is the entropy per baryon . in the initial nearly isentropic configuration ( assuming an index @xmath18 polytropic structure )",
    ", we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mean molecular weight ( @xmath21 for primordial composition   of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass ) . in equation  ( [ sinit ] ) we have assumed that @xmath22 and that all of the entropy is contributed by photons .",
    "this is an excellent approximation for a supermassive star near its general relativistic instability point .    as an example , if the entropy per baryon is reduced by a factor of 2.5 as a result of neutrino emission during the collapse , i.e. , @xmath23 , then the final homologous core mass will be about 10@xmath24 of the initial stellar mass , @xmath25 .",
    "the total newtonian gravitational binding energy of a homologous core with a mass @xmath26 is crudely @xmath27 .",
    "if there is no strong magnetic field present , most of this energy will be trapped inside the black hole , radiated through gravitational waves , or released by the neutrino emission prior to trapped surface formation .",
    "the characteristic core radius near the black hole formation point is the schwarzschild radius @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristic duration of the collapse is the dynamic time @xmath29 , or longer if rotation or magnetic fields hold up the collapse .",
    "it has been shown that the neutrino energy loss rate per unit volume , @xmath30 , as a result of electron - positron annihilation , has the simple form ( schinder et al .",
    "1987 ; itoh et al .",
    "1989 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 k. this equation is valid so long as the temperature @xmath33 ( the electron rest mass ) and as long as the density @xmath34 is low enough to ensure non - degeneracy ( @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the proton rest mass ) .",
    "both conditions are satisfied during the collapse of a supermassive star .",
    "the neutrino luminosity from a supermassive star is then @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius of the homologous core , @xmath40 is a factor accounting for the travel time difference for neutrinos coming out from different depths inside the core , and @xmath41 represents the effect of gravitational redshift .    during a homologous collapse ,",
    "the density @xmath34 has a self - similar profile of polytropic form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the central density of the star , and @xmath44 is the index @xmath18 lane - emden function and @xmath45 is a dimensionless length measure .",
    "the total pressure at any point in the star can be cast in the index @xmath18 polytropic form @xmath46 . here",
    "the pressure constant can be expressed as @xmath47\\ ,                     n_a^{4/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is avogadro s number and where @xmath49 is the relativistic particle statistical weight entering into the entropy per baryon @xmath50 .",
    "for all our considerations in this paper we can safely take @xmath51 .",
    "if we denote the density in units of @xmath52 as @xmath53 , then the pressure in units of mev@xmath54 will be @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the entropy per baryon @xmath17 in units of 100 boltzman s constant .",
    "we can estimate similarly the dimensionless length conversion factor , @xmath59 where , in terms of newton s constant @xmath60 , the planck mass is @xmath61 .",
    "because the entropy per baryon @xmath58 is roughly constant through out the radiation - dominated core at any time , we can estimate that @xmath62 ( fww ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 and the quantity @xmath64 we take @xmath65 in this form for simplicity in calculating the average core density @xmath66 .",
    "the neutrino luminosity can then be expressed through integrating the lane - emden function , @xmath67    apparently most of the neutrinos are emitted near the black hole formation point , where @xmath65 is the highest .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation we can take the radius of the core @xmath39 to be @xmath68 where @xmath69 , with a characteristic dynamic time of @xmath70 sec .",
    "the volume averaged core density is @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "the entropy per baryon in the homologous core ( fww ) is @xmath72 where @xmath73 , the factor by which the initial entropy is reduced by neutrino emission in the course of core collapse .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath74 from eq .",
    "( [ sloss ] ) we find @xmath75 .",
    "therefore @xmath76 . as a result ,",
    "( [ eloss1 ] ) becomes @xmath77    an accurate estimate of @xmath40 and @xmath41 requires a 3-d numerical treatment with full general relativity .",
    "given all the other uncertainties inherent in the problem of supermassive star formation and collapse , it suffices in this paper to give a ball - park   estimate of these factors using the newtonian picture . by assuming that all neutrinos are emitted in the positive radial direction ( not a bad one because most neutrinos are emitted from the central part of the core , as seen from figure 1 ) , and that the neutrino emission from the core is cut off when @xmath78 , we estimate that @xmath79 .    estimating @xmath41 is trickier . because most neutrinos are from the central region of the core , neutrinos emerging from the core when the core radius is @xmath39",
    "are mostly emitted @xmath80 earlier when the core still has a radius of @xmath81 and is less relativistic .",
    "we therefore apply the core surface redshift factor @xmath82 ( a factor of @xmath83 from energy redshift and an additional @xmath83 from time dilation to observers ) to all neutrinos .",
    "although the newtonian picture simply does nt apply to the strong field and time - dependent situation , we believe that by applying the above @xmath40 and @xmath41 to eq .",
    "( [ eloss1 ] ) we can get a ball - park   estimate for the neutrino luminosity @xmath84    the time evolution of the neutrino luminosity to an observer at infinity is shown in figure 2 , with @xmath85 being crudely the observer time axis if the core radius is collapsing at the speed of light .",
    "the peak luminosity is reached at @xmath86 . integrating over time",
    "yields the total neutrino energy loss up to the formation of the black hole @xmath87    the energy loss through neutrinos can not be greater than the gravitational binding energy itself .",
    "therefore , for @xmath88 the neutrino loss will saturate the limit of the gravitational binding energy and the above scaling with @xmath89 will break down .",
    "in fact when @xmath88 we do not expect our calculations to apply in the first place because neutrinos become trapped in the core instead of freely streaming out .",
    "so far we have assumed that the radius of the core collapses at the speed of light at the black hole formation point . the neutrino energy loss and luminosity can be significant larger than we have calculated if rapid rotation or strong magnetic fields slow down the collapse significantly .",
    "in these cases not only will the time available for neutrino release be longer , but the time delay factor @xmath40 will be less damaging .",
    "the energy spectra associated with neutrino emission from the annihilation of @xmath6-plasma with a temperature @xmath90 is best estimated using a monte carlo method : we pick an electron - positron pair from a thermal distribution at temperature @xmath90 , and randomly distribute the momentum of one neutrino in all directions in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the energies and momenta of the two neutrinos produced are then fixed by momentum and energy conservation .",
    "we then convert the neutrino energies back into the rest frame , and count each annihilation as @xmath91 events , where the amplitude of the annilihation matrix element is ( dicus 1972 ) @xmath92+(a^2-b^2)m_e^2(q_{\\nu}\\cdot q_{\\bar\\nu})\\}.\\ ] ] in this equation the @xmath93 s and @xmath94 s are four - momenta of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the electron rest mass .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and the @xmath102 sign is for @xmath103 , the @xmath104 sign is for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    after repeating the same process many times ( several billion times in our case ) , and tallying the total number of events that correspond to various energy bins",
    ", we have an un - normalized neutrino energy spectrum resulting from @xmath6 annihilation in a steady state equilibrium plasma .",
    "all three neutrino species share a common normalization so that the calculation gives a relative flux between @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 ) , which is around 4.7:1 as long as @xmath110 mev .",
    "the simulation also yields the temperature dependence of the neutrino fluxes , which is proportional to @xmath111 if @xmath33 , consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "we _ fit _ the neutrino spectrum ( normalized energy distribution function ) to the form @xmath112 where the relativistic fermi integrals are @xmath113 we find that for @xmath114 mev , @xmath115 and @xmath116 for all neutrino species .",
    "the average neutrino energy is @xmath117 , higher than that of the ambient @xmath6 plasma .",
    "this is because ( 1 ) electrons and positrons with higher energies have larger cross sections for annihilation into neutrinos , and ( 2 ) the mass of the electron and positron add into the energy of the neutrinos .",
    "figure 3 shows the arbitrarily - normalized neutrino energy spectrum calculated from our monte carlo method , and the analytical fit , at @xmath118 mev .",
    "the analytical fit is remarkably good .",
    "similar goodness of fit is also obtained for a variety of temperatures @xmath90 , ranging from @xmath119 mev to @xmath120 mev , fully covering the typical temperatures inside a collapsing supermassive star .",
    "the neutrino spectrum from the collapse of a supermassive star can be estimated from the single - temperature spectrum eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) averaged over the entire core and over its time evolution .",
    "a precise account is not warranted at this stage . as an estimate",
    ", we simply take the @xmath6 temperature to be that at the peak neutrino emission point in both space and time .",
    "that is , we estimate it at a position @xmath121 ( from figure 1 ) where neutrinos emitted at this position emerge from the core when @xmath122 ( from figure 2 ) .",
    "this turns out to be @xmath123 mev .",
    "therefore the neutrino spectrum from a supermassive star with a core mass of @xmath89 is to a fair approximation @xmath124 with an average energy @xmath125 the average energy can be a factor of 2 higher if the collapse is slowed down significantly by rotation / magnetic fields such that the travel time difference is much less important .",
    "if supermassive stars were ever ubiquitous in the universe , they would have left a significant neutrino background . assuming that a fraction @xmath126 of all baryons once resided in supermassive stars , and a fraction @xmath127 of the associated gravitational binding energy",
    "was released by neutrino emission , then the total background flux from this neutrino background is now @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the baryon density today , and @xmath130 is the average energy of the neutrinos from the collapse of supermassive stars .",
    "about 70@xmath24 of the flux is @xmath107 , and 15@xmath24 of the flux is @xmath108 or @xmath109 . since , from eq .",
    "( [ eloss ] ) and ( [ aver ] ) , @xmath131 is usually of order 1 , and @xmath132 mev , we have @xmath133 where @xmath134",
    "is @xmath129 divided by the critical density today , and @xmath135 is the present day hubble parameter in units of 100 km / sec / mpc .    if @xmath126 is 10@xmath24 , a fraction that is certainly allowed by known constraints , then the flux of background neutrinos from supermassive stars can be 100 times higher than the neutrino background from supernovae ( totani , sato & yoshii 1996 ; hartmann & woosley 1997 ; malaney 1997 )",
    "this is because metallicity considerations tightly constrain the fraction of baryons once in supernova progenitors to be @xmath136 , while the number and energy of neutrinos released per baryon may not differ much in the two kinds of collapse event ( supernovae vs. supermassive stars ) .",
    "the fraction of higher energy neutrinos ( @xmath10 mev ) in the neutrino background from supermassive stars is , however , very likely to be much smaller than that of the supernova neutrino background .",
    "this is because neutrinos coming from supermassive stars suffer a redshift factor @xmath137 if supermassive stars formed and collapsed at a redshift of @xmath138 , making the detection of these neutrinos very difficult .",
    "for example , if @xmath139 , the average energy of the neutrino background from supermassive stars will be only @xmath140 mev , far below the threshold of the currently - running super kamiokande experiment ( about 7 mev ) . further complicating the detection of supermassive star relic neutrinos",
    "is the fact that @xmath103 in the background will be hopelessly buried in the solar neutrino flux , which is @xmath141 @xmath142s@xmath143 at @xmath144 mev and @xmath145 @xmath142s@xmath143 at @xmath146 mev ; and the @xmath147 flux in the background under the optimal condition @xmath148 will be comparable to or less than the terrestrial @xmath147 background from nuclear power stations , which ranges from 10@xmath149 to @xmath150 @xmath151 s@xmath143 at the various sites of neutrino detectors ( lagage 1985 ) .",
    "clearly , an earth - bound detection of the neutrino background from supermassive stars will be extremely difficult , if not impossible .    as worked examples",
    ", we calculate the expected event rate from the supermassive star neutrino background in several new - generation neutrino detectors , including the currently - running super kamiokande .",
    "the fiducial masses , thresholds and detection channels of these experiments are listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 4 shows the expected event rates as a function of @xmath152 , the redshift at which all supermassive stars existed .",
    "we adopt a neutrino spectrum of the form in eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) assuming @xmath153 , and we assume 100@xmath24 detector efficiencies above the published thresholds .",
    "these assumptions are not entirely realistic , but they give good order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "the event rates scale linearly with the abundance of supermassive stars ( represented by @xmath126 , the fraction of baryons in these stars ) , and @xmath154 . from figure 4 it can be seen that super kamiokande ( totsuka 1997 ) may potentially be able to preclude more than @xmath155 of baryons ever having been in the form of supermassive stars at a redshift of @xmath156 ( although such a conjecture may have already been ruled out by not seeing them directly ! ) .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the neutrino flux from the collapse of a single supermassive star , and see what the requirement would be on detectors to observe such an event .",
    "if the collapse occured at redshift @xmath152 , its neutrino fluence now is @xmath157 where @xmath158 the luminosity distance to the star .",
    "the average neutrino energy now would be @xmath159 mev .",

    "this burst can be converted roughly into numbers of events in detectors by scaling from eq .",
    "( [ nubkgd ] ) and figure 4 .",
    "the number of events in the detectors are the yearly event rates in figure 4 ( with @xmath163 ) multiplied by @xmath164 .",
    "for example , a neutrino burst from a non - rotating non - magnetized collapsing supermassive star with @xmath165 at @xmath166 induces @xmath167 event in super kamiokande .",
    "this obviously is impossible to detect . the @xmath103 flux in the burst from the collapse of one supermassive star when the @xmath103 has a flux and energy comparable to that of the @xmath168b solar neutrinos will be completely swamped by the solar neutrino flux unless @xmath156 .",

    "the supermassive star @xmath147 component can only stand out from the nuclear reactor neutrinos when @xmath156 , when their average energy will be higher than the 3 mev peak energy of neutrinos from reactors .",
    "therefore , it seems that the best chance to detect such a neutrino burst from a distant supermassive star is in space , in reactions induced by @xmath147 , and with extremely large detectors . as a simplistic example , to establish a burst signal requires a minimum of about 10 @xmath169 events to be detected within a duration of @xmath170 seconds . on earth",

    "but in space , there may be a significantly lower @xmath147 background so that the mass of the detector needed will be substantially smaller .",
