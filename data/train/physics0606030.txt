    "the much used differential schrdinger equation  is normally solved by means of a finite difference method , such as numerov or runge - kutta , while the equivalent integral lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation is rarely solved .",
    "the reason , of course , is that the former is easier  to implement than the latter .",
    "however , a good method for solving the ls equation has recently been developed @xcite , and applications to various atomic systems have been presented @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this method , denoted as s - iem ( for spectral integral equation method ) , expands the unknown solution into chebyshev polynomials , and obtains equations for the respective coefficients .",
    "the expansion is called `` spectral '' , because it converges very rapidly , and hence is economical in the number of meshpoints required in order to attain a prescribed accuracy .",
    "a basic and simple description of the method has now been published @xcite , and a matlab implementation is also included .",
    "however , the applications described so far refer to positive energies , i.e. , to scattering situations , while an example for negative energies , i.e. , bound states , has up to now not been provided .",
    "since  the solution of many quantum - mechanical problems requires the availability of a basis of discrete negative energy eigenfunctions ( or bound states ) , or of positive energy sturm - liouville eigenfunctions , the s - iem has now been adapted to also obtain eigenfunctions and eigenvalues . since there are situations where the commonly known eigenvalue - finding methods do not work well , we present here a short description of our method , in the hope that it will be useful for the physics student / teacher community .",
    "an illustration of the method for the case of the bound state of the he - he atomic dimer is presented .",
    "this is an interesting case since the binding energy is very small , @xmath0 or @xmath1  , and the corresponding wave function extends out to large distances , between @xmath2 to @xmath3 atomic units , depending on the accuracy required .",
    "hence a method is desirable that maintains accuracy out to large distances , and that can find small eigenvalues .",
    "a commonly used method to obtain eigenvalues consists in discretizing the schrdinger differential operator into a matrix form , and then numerically obtaining the eigenvalues of this matrix .",
    "this procedure gives good accuracy for the low - lying ( most bound ) eigenvalues , while the least bound eigenvalues become inaccurate .",
    "the method described here does not suffer from this difficulty since it finds each eigenvalue of the integral equation iteratively  it also provides a good search procedure for finding initial values of the eigenvalue , required to start the iteration .",
    "for negative energy eigenvalues the differential equation to be solved is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radial distance in units of length , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the potential energy and the ( negative ) energy in units of energy , respectively .",
    "this is the radial equation for the partial wave of angular momentum @xmath8 for atomic physics applications this equation can be written in the dimensionless form@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the relative distance in units of bohr , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given in atomic energy units .",
    "the ls eigenvalue equation that is the equivalent to eq .",
    "( @xmath13 ) , is@xmath14 where , as is well known , the green s function @xmath15 for negative energies @xmath16 is given by@xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the lesser and larger values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , and @xmath22    the eq .",

    "unless the wave number @xmath23 has a correct value , the solution does not satisfy the boundary condition that @xmath24 decay exponentially at large distances . as shown by hartree many years ago ,",
    "a method of finding a correct value of @xmath23 is to start with an initial guess @xmath25 for @xmath23 , divide the corresponding ( wrong ) wave function into an `` out '' and and `` in '' part , and match the two at an intermediary point @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 part @xmath28 is obtained by integrating ( @xmath29 ) from the origin to an intermediate radial distance @xmath26 , and @xmath30 is the result of integrating ( @xmath29 ) from the upper limit of the radial range @xmath31 inward to @xmath26 . for the present application the integration method",
    "is based on the s - iem , described in appendix 1 .",
    "the function @xmath32 is renormalized so as to be equal to @xmath30 at @xmath33 and its value at @xmath33 is denoted as @xmath34 .",
    "the derivatives with respect to @xmath20 at @xmath33 are calculated , as described in appendix 1 , and are denoted as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the new value of the wave number @xmath37 is given in terms of these quantities as@xmath38 where @xmath39 equations ( [ delt1 ] ) and ( [ iter ] ) can be derived by first writing ( @xmath13 ) for the exact wave function @xmath40 ( using @xmath41 for @xmath25 and ( @xmath13 ) for the approximate wave function @xmath42 or @xmath43 , multiplying each equation by the other wave function , integrating over @xmath20 , and subtracting one from another .",
    "when @xmath44 is replaced by @xmath37 and @xmath40 is replaced by @xmath45 then equations ( @xmath46 ) and ( @xmath47 ) result .",
    "the s - iem procedure to evaluate @xmath32 and @xmath30 is as follows .",

    "two independent functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are obtained by solving the integral equations@xmath55 and @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are scaled forms of the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined above on the interval @xmath50 , @xmath61 and the scaling factor @xmath62 in each partition @xmath50 is given by @xmath63 such scaling factors are needed in order to prevent the unscaled functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the corresponding functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 to become too disparate at large distances , which in turn would result in a loss of accuracy . apart from these scaling operations , the calculation of functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 by means of expansions into chebychev polynomials , as well as the determination of the size of the partition @xmath50 in terms of the tolerance parameter @xmath70 is very similar to the calculation of the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 described in ref .",

    ". the important question of how to find an initial value @xmath103 of @xmath23 is described in the next section .",
    "since the present method does not obtain  all the values of the energy as the eigenvalues of one big matrix , but rather obtains iteratively one selected eigenvalue at a time , it is necessary to have a reliable algorithm for finding the appropriate starting values @xmath103 for the iteration procedure .",
    "the present search method is based on eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) , according to which the solution @xmath72 in a given partition @xmath50 is made up of two parts , @xmath53 and @xmath104 in the radial regions where the potential is small compared to the energy , i.e. , in the `` far '' region beyond the outer turning point , the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54  are nearly equal to the driving terms @xmath105 and @xmath106 of the respective integral equations ( [ y ] ) and ( [ z ] ) .",
