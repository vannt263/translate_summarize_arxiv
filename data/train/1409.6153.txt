    "two dimensional ising model should be the best understood statistical model .",
    "exact results of the model on finite sizes with various boundary conditions ( bcs ) have been studied @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge has been obtained for the torus case @xcite , for helical bcs @xcite , for brascamp - kunz bcs @xcite and for infinitely long cylinder@xcite .",
    "the ising model on the finite lattice plays an important role on the finite size scaling @xcite , which finds extensive applications in the analysis of experimental , monte carlo , and transfer - matrix data , as well as in recent theoretical developments related to conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "however for the complete open bcs , i.e. with open edges and sharp corners , some interesting results begin to appear in recent years @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the free bcs are studied . in this paper , we consider the fixed bcs .",
    "one of the methods to solve the two dimensional ising model with free boundary is the bond propagation ( bp ) algorithm .",
    "it was developed for computing the partition function of the ising model in two dimensions first @xcite .",
    "later on , the bp algorithm for the internal energy and specific heat are also developed @xcite .",
    "it is so powerful that very large system sizes and very accurate numerical results can be reached . with this algorithm ,",
    "the calculations have been carried out on square and triangular lattices with free boundaries @xcite .",
    "the results of free energy , internal energy and specific heat are surprisingly accurate to @xmath0 .",
    "the exact edge and corner terms on the square lattice and triangle lattice with various shapes are conjectured .",
    "recently one of the authors develops the bp algorithm with a surface field @xcite , which is called sfbp algorithm .",
    "we use the sfbp algorithm to study the two dimensional ising model with fixed boundary .",
    "we have studied three types of fixed bcs :  @xmath1 \" ,  @xmath2 \" and  @xmath3 \" , which are defined in section ii . the free bc is denoted by  @xmath4 \" .",
    "we have carried out numerical calculations of the free energy , internal energy and specific heat on the square lattice with a square shape .",
    "for each edge , we assign a type of bc .",
    "we present the results of ten bcs including @xmath5 ( where the four edges are assigned  @xmath6 \" type bc ) , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "through fitting the data , we get very accurate expansions of the free energy , internal energy and specific heat .",
    "the corner logarithmic corrections in the free energy verify the conformal field theory ( cft ) predictions @xcite .",
    "the exact edge and corner logarithmic terms in the internal energy and specific heat are conjectured .",
    "the accurate finite size expansions at the critical point are helpful to the cft and renormalization group ( rg ) study on the boundary effects @xcite . an interesting way to see the effect of the irrelevant operators is to compute the asymptotic expansion ( in powers of @xmath16 ) of the free energy and its derivatives with respect to the temperature at the critical point . in the corner terms of the free energy and in the edge and corner terms of the internal energy and specific heat , there are logarithmic corrections .",
    "the logarithmic terms are usually related to the singular part of free energy @xcite . therefore studying these logarithmic corrections",
    "is specially important .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . since",
    "this paper is very long , we first summarize our results in section ii . in section iii , iv and",
    "v , we present the fittings of the free energy density , the internal energy and the specific heat respectively .",
    "section vi is a discussion and acknowledgement .",
    "the fig . 1 shows some lattices with typical bcs . we have studied three types of fixed bcs .",
    "the first one is  @xmath6 \" (  @xmath17 \" ) type , where all the spins at the boundary are fixed to be positive ( negative ) .",
    "the second one is antiferromagnetic  a `` type , where the spins at the boundary are fixed positive , negative alternatively .",
    "the third one is double antiferromagnetic ' ' b \" , where the spins at the boundary are fixed positive , positive , negative , negative successively . together with the free boundary ( denoted by  0 \" )",
    ", we have four types bcs . for a square , there are four edges , we denote the boundaries by ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "( 1a ) the bcs on the four edges are fixed ",
    "+ \" , fixed  a \" , fixed  b \" , fixed  - \" in proper order respectively , then we denote the bcs by  @xmath20 \" .",
    "we study the ising model with these bcs using sfbp algorithms @xcite .",
    "the fixed bcs is realized in sfbp in the following way .",
    "consider a @xmath21 lattice with coupling constant between spins being @xmath22 . if the bottom ( the zeroth row of spins ) is assigned to be ",
    "@xmath6 \" type boundary , it is equivalent to applying a field with intensity of @xmath22 to the first row of spins without the zeroth row of spins . if the boundary is the type ",
    "@xmath4 \" , the surface field on the first row are zero .",
    "if the boundary is type  @xmath2 \" , the surface field on the first row of spins are @xmath23 and @xmath24 alternatively .",
    "if the boundary is type  @xmath3 \" , the surface field on the first row of spins are @xmath23 , @xmath23 @xmath24 , and @xmath24 successively .",
    "the other edges can be dealt similarly .",
    "then the @xmath21 lattice with fixed bcs becomes a @xmath25 lattice with a surface field .",
    "in other words we can solve the ising model with a surface filed to study the fixed boundary .",
    "consider the ising model with a surface field @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the boundary , and the surface field is assigned according to the bcs , which is discussed above .",
    "we calculate the partition function @xmath28 then get the free energy density @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of spins .",
    "the internal energy density is defined by @xmath31 and specific heat per spin by @xmath32     lattice with bcs @xmath20 .",
    "( b ) the @xmath33 lattice with bcs @xmath10 .",
    "( c ) the @xmath33 lattice with bcs @xmath9 .",
    "( d ) the @xmath33 lattice with bcs @xmath34 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we have calculated the free energy , internal energy and specific heat at the critical point @xmath35 with various bcs . we only present the results with ten bcs including @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . in the first three cases",
    "the bcs of the four edges are the same , so we can get the edge term easily . in all these cases ,",
    "the bcs for the four corners are the same , so we can get the corner term easily .",
    "we find that the critical free energy density can be expanded into @xmath39 where the surface term @xmath40 is the sum of the four edges contribution , @xmath41 denote the bcs of the @xmath42th edge ; the corner term @xmath43 is the sum of the four corners contribution , @xmath44 denotes the bcs of the @xmath42th corner . for example , the contribution from a corner with two edges under bcs  + \" and0 \" is denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "we expand the the free energy ( the internal energy and specific heat in the next two sections ) to as high order as possible to make the deviation as small as possible . in all fittings of the free energy , we take @xmath46 .    in our fittings",
    "we confirm the exact result given by onsager@xcite , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 .    for the free bcs ,",
    "the edge term @xmath49 has been obtained in our previous work @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "this is obtained by comparing our numerical result on the rectangle with the exact result on the cylinder by helen and fisher @xcite .    in the fittings for the free energy data ,",
    "the other surface terms are given by @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , it is satisfied that @xmath55 this is obtained by comparing the result on brascamp - kunz bcs @xcite , where the cylinder with upper edge under ",
    "@xmath6 \" bcs and bottom edge under ",
    "@xmath2 \" bcs .",
    "the corner terms @xmath56 are very interesting because they are universal and logarithmic .",
    "cardy and peschel studied the free energy with in cft @xcite .",
    "they predicted that a corner with angle @xmath57 and two edges under free bcs , gives rise to the term @xmath58 in the free energy expansion , where @xmath59 is the central charge . that is to say @xmath60 .",
    "this is verified in our previous work on the square lattice and triangle lattice with free bcs @xcite .",
    "late on , imamura et al .",
    "study the corner terms with different bcs within cft @xcite . according to their results ,",
    "the contribution to the free energy from a corner with two edges under @xmath61 and @xmath62 bcs , @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the conformal weight of the boundary operator inserting at the corner and @xmath59 is the central charge for the ising model .",
    "there are three different conformal weights in the ising model , namely , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "there are also three different conformally invariant boundary conditions , generally denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath17 and @xmath68 @xcite , where first two described fixed boundary conditions on the spin @xmath69 or @xmath70 respectively , and @xmath68 corresponds to free boundary conditions .",
    "when boundary conditions on both sides of the corner are the same ( @xmath71 ) , the boundary operator is just identity operator with @xmath72 . in the case when boundary conditions on one side of the corner is @xmath73 and on another side is @xmath74 , the boundary operator has conformal weight @xmath75 and in the case when boundary condition on one side of the corner is @xmath73 or @xmath17 and on another side is @xmath76 or @xmath3 the boundary operator has conformal weight @xmath77 .",
    "we also get the following result , when boundary conditions on both sides of the corner are @xmath78 or @xmath3 , the boundary operator has conformal weight @xmath72 .",
    "thus we have obtained that the boundary conditions @xmath78 and @xmath3 are all belong to the free conformally invariant boundary condition .",
    "then we have the table for @xmath79 @xmath80 where the first column is @xmath61 and the first row is @xmath62 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath81 .",
    "our numerical results verified these predictions in very high accuracies .",
    "the detailed fittings of the numerical data are presented in section iii .",
    "as one can see , the bcs ",
    "@xmath82 \" play the same role in the corner terms . in cft , these bcs belong to the same type indeed . however they play different roles in the internal energy and specific heat , which are show in the following .",
    "this is the reason why we study these three types of bcs",
    " @xmath82 \" .",
    "we find that the critical internal energy can be expanded into @xmath83 where the surface term @xmath84 is the sum of the four edges contribution and the corner term @xmath85 is the sum of the four corners contribution .    in the expansions , we confirm the exact result of the bulk value @xcite @xmath86    from the results with various bcs , the surface terms are given by @xmath87    the corner terms @xmath88",
    "are summarized in the following expression @xmath89 where @xmath61 is shown in the left column and @xmath62 is shown in the first row .",
    "the corner term @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 it should be noted that @xmath92 as compared with @xmath93 .",

    "the detailed fittings of the numerical data extracting these coefficients are presented in section v.    we also studied the more complicated bcs such as @xmath104 , etc .",
    "all the results satisfy the expansion form in eqs .",

    "however these results are not presented in this paper .",
    "let us to summarize the results and give some remarks :    \\1 .",
    "the edge and corner logarithmic terms are additive , for example for the surface free energy , @xmath105 .",
    "there is only one logarithmic correction , the corner term , in the free energy .",
    "there are only two logarithmic corrections , the edge and corner terms , in the internal energy .",
    "there are only three logarithmic corrections , the leading term , the edge and corner terms in the specific heat .",
    "the logarithmic terms are usually related to the singular part of free energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results are helpful to determine the singular part of the free energy , which plays a key role in the rg and scaling theory .",

    "@xcite , using conformal - field theory , the authors classify the possible irrelevant operators for the ising model with periodic bcs .",
    "now we can ask a similar question : for the bcs @xmath106 , what boundary states exist ?",
