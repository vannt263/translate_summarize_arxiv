    "the nms implemented by phoebe optionally enables semi - constrained or fully constrained minimization by imposing limits to several or all adjusted parameter values .",
    "additionally , heuristic scan , parameter kicking and conditional constraining enable nms to efficiently escape from local minima .      eb minimization algorithms , including even nms with its property of guarranteed convergence , can be stuck in a local minimum , particularly since parameter hyperspace in vicinity of the global minimum is typically very flat , with lots of local minima .",
    "in addition , global minimum may be shadowed by data noise and degeneracy .",
    "heuristic scan is an enhancement method to any minimization algorithm ( dc , nms ,  ) that selects a set of starting points in parameter hyperspace and starts the minimization from each such point .",
    "the user defines how starting points are selected  they may be gridded , stochastically dispersed , distributed according to some probability distribution function ( pdf ) etc .",
    "the algorithm then sorts all solutions by the cost function ( the @xmath36 , for example ) and weights the obtained parameter values accordingly : heuristic runs with smallest values of the cost function correspond to the deepest minima and should thus be most weighted  they are most suitable candidates for the global minimum .",
    "the weighted values of adjusted parameters are then put into histograms , from which the mean and standard deviation of parameter values are calculated .",

    "the correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath31 is evidently very flat at @xmath61 , which may be easily understood : the model is able to compensate smaller inclinations by enlarging the radius of the star and vice versa",
    ". therefore we should not trust light curve analysis to disentangle these parameters by itself ",
    "additional constraints are needed .",
    "this issue will be further discussed in section [ physics ] .",
    "another possible approach to detect and escape from local minima is to use a stochastic method such as simulated annealing ( sa ) .",
    "however , such methods are notoriously slow .",
    "thus , instead of full - featured sa scan , a simple new procedure has been developed that achieves the same effect as stochastic methods , but in significantly shorter time .",
    "the idea is as follows : whenever a minimum is reached within a given fractional accuracy , the algorithm runs a globality assessment on that minimum . if we presume that standard deviations @xmath62 of observations are estimated properly and that they apply to all data points , we may use them for @xmath36 weighting : @xmath63 where index @xmath27 runs over @xmath64 measurements within a single data - set and index @xmath65 runs over @xmath66 data - sets ( photometric and rv curves ) ; @xmath67 are observed data points , @xmath68 are calculated data points and @xmath69 s are individual weights . since the weighted variance is given by : @xmath70 we may readily express @xmath71 as : @xmath72 and the overall @xmath36 value as : @xmath73    if @xmath62 are realistic , the ratio @xmath74 is of the order unity and @xmath36 of the order @xmath75 .",
    "this we use for parameterizing @xmath36 values : @xmath76    parameter kicking is a way of knocking the obtained parameter - set out of the minimum : using the gaussian pdf , the method randomly picks an offset for each parameter .",
    "the strength of the kick is determined by the gaussian dispersion @xmath77 , which depends on the minimum globality assessment parameter @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath78 is high , then the kick should be strong , but if it is low , i.e.  around @xmath79 , then only subtle perturbations should be allowed .",
    "experience shows that a simple expression such as : @xmath80 works very efficiently in case of partial eclipses .",
    "this causes @xmath77 to assume a value of @xmath81 for @xmath82 offsets and @xmath83 for @xmath84 offsets , being linear in between . note that this @xmath77 is _ relative _ , i.e.  given by : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the value of the given parameter .",
    "when convergence within the given fractional accuracy is reached , parameters are kicked with respect to the depth of the minimum and the minimization is restarted from displaced points .",
    "the influence of consecutive parameter kicking with nms is depicted in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] ; it is shown that out of all heuristic scans only @xmath4830% initially converge to within 1% of optimal value of @xmath78 , whereas this percentage steadily grows to @xmath4860% after three kicks .",
    "[ tracer](b)(d ) show significant improvement to the solution introduced by these consecutive kicks .",
    "parameter kicking is able to quickly escape from local minima and thus rapidly increase convergence efficiency of the whole nms method .",

    "complement _ it .",
    "dc is created for interactive usage and converges in discrete steps that need monitoring .",
    "nms on the other hand aims to automate this process so that intermediate monitoring is no longer necessary .",

    "nms is one of the most robust algorithms for solving non - linear minimization problems and never diverges . finally ,",
    "both dc and nms suffer from degeneracy and may become stuck in local minima . to overcome this ,",
    "both methods are complemented by heuristic scan and parameter kicking .",
    "these differences in intent make a combination of the two methods a powerful engine for solving the inverse problem .",
    "wd s extensive list of more than 30 adjustable parameters is an overwhelming indicator of how sophisticated the model has become in 35 years of development . nevertheless , accuracy is crucial for a model to describe such a wide diversity of intrinsically different binaries .",
    "an accurate model should contain all relevant physical contributions for which the governing laws are well - known .",
    "we start the discussion by introducing new physical ties and constraints to parameter extracting schemes that are implemented in phoebe .",
    "it should be stressed that all these constraints are _ optional _ and it is up to the user to select the ones that are of interest .",
    "one of the main difficulties of modeling ebs is accurate determination of individual temperatures of both components .",
    "frequent practice in literature is to _ assume _ the temperature of one star ( e.g.  from spectra or color indices ) and fit the temperature of the other star .",
    "this approach is often inadequate , particularly for binaries with similar component temperatures and luminosities : in such cases , the contribution of both components to the system luminosity is significant and it is difficult to accurately estimate the contribution of only one star in advance .",
    "before we propose a method capable of providing individual temperatures from standard photometry observations without any  priori assumptions , it proves useful to introduce a concept of effective temperature _ of the binary_. a binary may be regarded as a point - source , the effective temperature of which varies in time . to this effective temperature",
    "contribute both components according to their sizes and individual temperatures , and the inclination .",
    "effective temperature of the binary is directly revealed by the color index , so its observational behavior is well known .",
    "if a model is to accurately reproduce observations , the composite of contributions of both components must match this behavior .    the observational light curve quantity ( dependent variable ) wd works with",
    "is _ flux _ , scaled to an arbitrary level ( which could also be in absolute physical units , i.e.  w / m@xmath90 per wavelength interval ) .",
    "the model adapts to this level by determining the corresponding passband luminosity @xmath26 , one for each passband .",
    "however , these passband luminosities are completely decoupled from one another , so any color information that might have been present in the data is discarded . since the effective temperature of a binary is observationally revealed by its @xmath91 ( or any other suitable ) color index , some of the relevant temperature information is lost .",
    "transformation to fluxes in absolute units would not suffice for properly determining the corresponding passband luminosities ",
    "one needs a _ physical relation _ between those luminosities . neglecting",
    "this additional relation may result in discordant colors between the temperatures obtained by the fit ( assuming that @xmath34 is  priori known ) and the ones determined by the binary s effective temperature .",
    "this relation is nothing else than the color index and may thus be accurately determined from observations .    in the last decade",
    "substantial effort was made to scan the sky for standard stars to be used for photometric calibration : @xcite covering celestial equator , @xcite and @xcite covering fields around cataclysmic variables , @xcite covering fields around symbiotic binaries , to name just a few .",
    "these efforts help overcome the problem of small ccd fields with respect to all - sky photometry , since in many fields there are now cataloged standard stars that may be used to extract color indices for ebs . in context of phoebe",
    ", this means that using measured color indices as additional information is plausible even if the data were not obtained under photometric conditions .",
    "phoebe initially regards @xmath26 s as simple level - setting quantities  physical context comes in only after the color index constraint is set . for the sake of simplicity , consider that input observational data are supplied in magnitudes ( such that the color indices are meaningful ) rather than fluxes .",
    "phoebe input data in individual passbands should not be scaled arbitrarily ; that is phoebe s job .",
    "the native type that phoebe works with is inherited from wd , which is flux .",
    "phoebe uses a single , passband - independent parameter @xmath92 to transform _ all _ light curves from magnitudes to fluxes .",
    "the value of @xmath92 is chosen so that the fluxes of the dimmest light curve are of the order of unity .",
    "it is _ a single quantity _ for all light curves , which immediately implies that the magnitude difference , now the flux ratio , is preserved ; hence , the color index is preserved .",
    "if the distance to the binary is known ( e.g.  from astrometry ) , @xmath92 immediately yields _ observed _ luminosities of the binary ; intrinsic luminosities are obtained if the color excess @xmath93 is also known .",
    "this is where physics comes in : from such set of observations , the calculated @xmath26 s are indeed passband luminosities , the ratios of which are the constraints we need : passband luminosities of light curves are now connected by the corresponding color indices .",
    "once the color constraint is set , phoebe makes sure that the ratio between @xmath26 s is kept constant .",
    "now that the color indices are preserved , effective temperature of the binary may be obtained from a color  temperature calibration .",
