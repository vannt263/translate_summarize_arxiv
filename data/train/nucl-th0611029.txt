    "a small admixture of @xmath14 states is also present . in",
    "@xmath15 scattering the coulomb interaction is paramount not only to treat @xmath16 but also to separate the @xmath11 threshold from @xmath12 and at the same time avoid a second excited state of the @xmath17 particle a few kev bellow the lowest scattering threshold .",
    "all these complex features make the @xmath15 scattering problem not only a natural theoretical laboratory to test different force models of the nuclear interaction , but also the next step in the pursuit of very accurate _ ab initio _ calculations of the @xmath18-body scattering problem after the extensive work on the three - nucleon @xmath19 system that has taken place in the past twenty years by several groups @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite all the reactions mentioned above were studied in the framework of alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite using the rank one representation of realistic two - nucleon @xmath20 force models together with a high rank representation of all @xmath21 subsystem amplitudes ; the coulomb interaction was neglected .",
    "this led to one - variable integral equations whose predictive power was limited to the quality of the involved approximations .",
    "the calculations showed large discrepancies with data , namely nucleon analyzing power @xmath1 in @xmath11 scattering , tensor observables in @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the differential cross section for @xmath24 , but one surprising success in describing the total cross section @xmath25 for @xmath0 scattering in the resonance region where at neutron lab energy @xmath26 mev @xmath25 rises to about 2.45 b @xcite .",
    "calculations by the grenoble group @xcite using coordinate - space solutions of the faddeev - yakubovsky equations @xcite showed , on the contrary , that realistic interactions missed the total cross section peak by at least 0.2 b. although these calculations carried out no approximation on the treatment of the @xmath27 interaction , they were limited vis -  - vis ref .",
    "@xcite on the number of @xmath21 and @xmath15 partial waves .",
    "although the issue was recently clarified @xcite by comparing to an independent calculation by the pisa group that uses the kohn variational method , together with hyperspherical harmonics , further studies based on the ags equations are needed to settle this important problem because some of the results by the grenoble and pisa groups may be still of limited accuracy given the number of included @xmath27 , @xmath21 , and @xmath15 partial waves .",
    "further investigations are also needed for the understanding of other @xmath15 reactions such as @xmath16 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 where large discrepancies with data were previously found .",
    "one fundamental issue underlying four - nucleon physics is the existence of correlations between @xmath21 and @xmath15 observables .",
    "one of the best known is the tjon line @xcite which correlates the binding energies of @xmath4 with @xmath28 ; another one involves the triton binding energy and the singlet ( triplet ) @xmath0 scattering length @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , other correlations may exist : one could ask if the persistent @xmath1 problem in @xmath2 scattering is in any way related to the failure to reproduce @xmath25 in @xmath0 scattering in the resonance region , or to the @xmath1 problem in @xmath16 @xcite ; does resolving the former also solves the latter ?    therefore we present here a new numerical approach to the solution of the ags equations that is both numerically exact and extremely fast in terms of cpu - time demand . since the @xmath27 transition matrix ( t - matrix ) is treated exactly , the equations we solve are , after partial wave decomposition , three - variable integral equations .",
    "the three jacobi momentum variables in @xmath29 and @xmath30 configurations are discretized on a finite mesh and the number of @xmath27 , @xmath21 and @xmath15 partial waves increased up to what is needed for the full convergence of the observables .",
    "the present approach also allows for the inclusion of charge - dependent interactions as well as @xmath31 degrees of freedom that lead to an effective @xmath21 force .",
    "furthermore , using the method recently proposed to treat the coulomb force in @xmath32 elastic scattering and breakup @xcite , we have already obtained preliminary results for @xmath16 elastic scattering observables @xcite with the coulomb potential between the three protons included .    in sec .",

    "therefore , in close analogy with three - nucleon scattering , we calculate the neumann series for the on - shell matrix elements of the transition operators and sum by the pad method @xcite .",
    "the pad summation algorithm we use is described in ref .",
    "we work with the half - shell transition operators in the form @xmath95 with the auxiliary states @xmath96 . defining @xmath97 and using eq .   for the inhomogeneous terms in order to eliminate @xmath98 , eqs .",
    "become    [ eq : ags - x ] @xmath99    in practical calculations , in order to accelerate the convergence of the pad summation , it is advantageous to substitute eq .   into eq .   yielding the neumann series    [ eq : neumannx ] @xmath100    which requires @xmath29 and @xmath30 subsystem transition operators @xmath101 , contained in @xmath102 , fully off - shell at different energies .",
    "explicit calculation of @xmath101 is not only very time consuming but also requires large storage devices .",
    "therefore , except at the bound state poles , we do not calculate the full off - shell transition matrices @xmath101 explicitly .",

    "thus , compared to the calculation of full off - shell @xmath101 , the method we are using avoids storage problems and also significantly reduces the number of required floating point operations , since it is essentially a calculation of _ half - shell _ matrix elements for a number of driving terms that are considerably fewer than the linear dimension of the discretized @xmath101 .",
    "a further advantage is that the matrices corresponding to the operators @xmath108 , @xmath44 and @xmath63 in eq .",
    "have block - diagonal structure whereas @xmath101 is a full matrix .",
    "the calculation of the neumann series for @xmath109 is what we are doing in three - nucleon scattering and is described in great detail in refs .",
    "the specific representation of the permutation operator @xmath110 where the initial and final state momenta @xmath111 are chosen as independent variables requires the interpolation in the momentum @xmath112 for the quantities on both sides of @xmath113 , i.e. , for @xmath63 or @xmath114 .",

    "@xcite ; in the context of four - nucleon equations where one has to work with @xmath29 and @xmath30 basis states the spline interpolation is more convenient .    the calculation of the neumann series for @xmath58 is straightforward because of the very simple form of the permutation operator @xmath115 .    finally , the application of the permutation operator @xmath116 as well as the transformation of @xmath117 from @xmath29 basis to @xmath30 or vice versa has a structure similar to that of @xmath110 , resulting in a similar treatment",

    "furthermore , we check the numerical stability of our calculations . these results are presented in the appendix and show that the present algorithm is numerically highly reliable and capable of reproducing previous published results .",

    "[ fig : nttot ] is compatible with the discrepancies we observe relative to the differential cross section data .",
    "therefore it would be recommended that some of the experiments be repeated at specific energies and @xmath1 measured in order to further understand the implications of the @xmath27 force models .    one important observation that comes out of these calculations is the increased sensitivity of @xmath15 observables to changes in the @xmath27 interaction . the variations due to the @xmath27 potential at the maximum of @xmath0 @xmath1 lead to about 16% fluctuations which are larger than the 10% fluctuations observed at the peak of @xmath1 in low energy @xmath2 scattering .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath15 system is more sensitive to off - shell differences of the @xmath27 force than the @xmath21 system .",
    "finally , in table [ tab : pmod ] we investigate the possible correlations between the @xmath1-puzzle in low energy @xmath2 scattering and the underestimation of @xmath25 in @xmath0 scattering in the resonance region .",
    "the experimental data for @xmath1 in @xmath2 scattering can be accounted for by a calculation with modified interactions in @xmath27 @xmath187 waves @xcite .",

    "the second one , inoy04 , is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and differs from inoy04 by @xmath187 wave parameters .",
    "although both modified potentials provide quite satisfactory description of vector analyzing powers in low energy @xmath2 scattering , they are incompatible with present day @xmath27 data basis .",
    "e.g. , the @xmath189 values with respect to the @xmath190 data , estimated using the nijmegen error matrix @xcite , i.e. , by comparing to the nijmegen phase shifts rather than to data directly , are 3.5 for inoy04 and 4.4 for av18 potentials . however , those modifications of the potentials are unable to resolve the @xmath25 discrepancy in @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the @xmath25 is slightly increased for av18 but it gets even lower for inoy04 , indicating that @xmath25 depends on the @xmath27 @xmath187 wave interaction in a different way than the @xmath1 in the @xmath2 scattering .",
