    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) and a variety of quantum nanostructures based on dms materials have recently attracted much interest due to the novel physics and the potential application to the emergent field of spintronics.@xcite the discovery of the ferromagnetism in the iii - v based dms materials ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as and in@xmath0mn@xmath1as has made it possible to combine the magnetic and semiconducting properties in one material .",

    "the self - organized ( in , mn)as quantum dots were successfully fabricated by growing ( in , mn)as on the ( 100 ) , ( 211)b , ( 311)b gaas substrates using low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy , which were subsequently capped by the gaas layer.@xcite the electron diffraction pattern and the atomic force microscopy measurement confirmed the formation of the ( in , mn)as quantum dots .",

    ", we theoretically study the ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dot arrays embedded in semiconductors .",
    "in contrast to the bulk ferromagnetic semiconductors , the following two processes lead to the ferromagnetism in the present systems : ( 1 ) the localized spins of mn@xmath6 interact with the quantum - confined holes in the dots through exchange coupling , and ( 2 ) the localized orbital of the quantum - confined holes in the dots hybridizes with the itinerant holes in the semiconductor valence band . the hybridization allows hole transfer between the dms quantum dots , which may induce the long range ferromagnetic order of the localized spins . in turn , the carrier spins both in the dms quantum dots and in the semiconductors are polarized , which is crucial to realize spintronics . in order to describe the basic physics , we propose an anderson - like model hamiltonian , where the onsite coulomb interaction is replaced by the exchange interaction .",
