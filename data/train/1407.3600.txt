    "in recent years the interest in high density plasmas has increased steadily .",
    "examples are dense plasmas in the interior of the giant planets @xcite and compact stars as well as highly compressed laboratory plasmas , such as laser plasmas or inertial confinement fusion plasmas @xcite , for a recent experimental study see @xcite . in these systems",
    "often the electrons are quantum degenerate and weakly or moderately coupled whereas the ions are classical and moderately and sometimes strongly coupled . for both components it is crucial to include finite temperature effects which poses particular challenges for theory @xcite and computer simulations , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the properties of the electron gas are a crucial ingredient to correctly describe dense plasmas as well as the electron gas in metals .",
    "accurate data for the electron gas at zero temperature have been provided long ago by quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite and have been massively used in density functional calculations . in",
    "the mean time new and improved ground state data have appeared , the most accurate ones , apparantly , being the configuration interaction monte carlo data of refs .",
    "however , these are all restricted to zero temperature and not applicable to highly excited systems such as warm dense matter .",
    "the extension of ab initio simulations to finite temperature is possible using the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique , e , g , @xcite , and many results have been obtained for fermions in the recent two decades , including correlated electrons in quantum dots , e.g. @xcite or dense plasmas , e.g. @xcite .",
    "only recently pimc simulations were applied to the electron gas at finite temperature .",
    "_ presented restricted path integral monte carl ( rpimc ) results that used the fixed node approximation @xcite that cover a broad parameter range of the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "subsequently , semi - analytical fits were presented that intended to combine the pimc results with the known analytical limits @xcite .",
    "a key problem of these data is that the accuracy of the results at high degeneracy is unknown since the fixed nodes used in the rpimc simulations carry a systematic error that is difficult to quantify . as a test , brown et al .",
    "also performed fermionic simulations and observed increasing discrepancies at high degeneracy ( @xmath2 ) . at the same time they encountered large errors of the fermionic simulations since the average sign was very small , which is a direct manifestation of the fermion sign problem .",
    "thus , the question of reliable high - temperature data for the uniform electron gas at high densities remains .",
    "therefore , the motivation of the present work is to perform new independent first - principle direct fermionic pimc simulations and compare them to the earlier results . to this end",
    "we make use of a pimc approach that was developed several years ago and successfully applied to dense hydrogen @xcite , hydrogen - helium mixtures @xcite , to the electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors @xcite and to the nonideal quark gluon plasma @xcite . to simulate the uniform electron gas the code",
    "is modified such that the positive charge component is treated as an ideal gas neglecting correlations .",
    "furthermore , to be able to simulate situations of high degeneracy , the treatment of exchange effects is substantially improved .",

    "the neutral uniform electron gas ( ueg ) or jellium is a quantum mechanical model of interacting electrons where the positive charges ( e.g. atomic nuclei of a solid ) are assumed to form a uniform in space charge background that assures overall charge neutrality but is not treated microscopically .",
    "the model allows one to focus on the effects that occur due to the quantum nature of electrons and their repulsive interactions and to treat the electron ",
    "electron interaction rigorously .",
    "the artificial and structureless background charge interacts electrostaticaly with itself and the electrons .",
    "the jellium hamiltonian ( for a text book disussion , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for @xmath3 electrons confined within a volume of the space @xmath4 and with electronic density @xmath5 and background charge density @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron hamiltonian consisting of kinetic and electron  electron repulsion terms : @xmath9 @xmath10 is the hamiltonian of the positive background charge describing its electrostatic self  interaction .",
    "its expectation value is @xmath11 where we introduced the fourier component of the coulomb potential , @xmath12 .",
    "the contribution of the electrostatic electron  background interaction is given by @xmath13 in a finite system , the results ( [ bck ] ) and ( [ e - bck ] ) are finite because @xmath14 approaches a finite minimal value determined by the system volume . if , however , the thermodynamic limit is taken , this limit for @xmath14 becomes zero , as indicated in the formulas and the two results diverge .",
    "this divergence is exactly canceled by the @xmath15 contribution of the electron ",
    "electron interaction which has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath16 this cancellation is due to the assumption of charge neutrality and allows to neglect the background contribution entirely and just study the electron component , omitting the @xmath15 contribution ( i.e. the spatially homogenous part ) to the thermodynamic quantities .    in our simulations",
    "we employ a finite simulation cell . for this case , again , the background related energies can be calculated .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , a spherical simulation cell of radius @xmath17 with a particle number chosen such that a given density @xmath18 is realized , i.e. @xmath19 , one readily obtains from standard electrostatics for the background energy ( electrostatic selfenergy ) @xmath20 similarly , the interaction energy of @xmath3 electrons homogeneously distributed in this sphere with the homogeneous charge background is found to be @xmath21 and equals exactly minus two times the background energy , independently of the system size .",
    "both terms diverge with increasing system size .",
    "but one readily sees that the sum of both energies , again , is exactly cancelled by the analogous contribution of the electrons which equals @xmath22 .",
    "this underlines that all electrostatic mean field contributions compensate each other , and the non - vanishing reminder of the interaction energy is just due to electronic correlations i.e. density fluctuations around the uniform density .",
    "we can now estimate the scaling of the background energy contribution with system size and density . to this end",
    "we switch to atomic units introducing the density ( brueckner ) parameter , @xmath23 , where the mean interparticle distance is given by @xmath24^{1/3}$ ] , @xmath25 denotes the bohr radius , and energies are given in hartree with @xmath26",
    ". then we obtain for the background energy per particle : @xmath27      particle simulations of coulomb systems face the problem of an unlimited increase of the interation energy at small distances .",
    "quantum simulations such as path integral monte carlo avoid the coulomb divergences in a natural way .",
    "this has been demonstrated before for pimc simulations of two - component electron - ion plasmas e.g. @xcite and electron - hole plasmas @xcite .",
    "here we adapt these simulations to jellium by treating it as the limiting case of the neutral two - component plasma ( @xmath28 ) where , at the end , the background component ( the ions ) will be treated as non - interacting .",

    "the above formulas have been applied successfullly to multi - component dense quantum plasma simulations @xcite , to the electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors @xcite as well as to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to retain the same program also for the simulation of jellium where the positive component ( protons ) is treated as a homogeneous static background .",
    "this has the advantage that both components are treated consistently , in particular , the background contribution will be automatically adjusted to the chosen particle number ( which would not be the case if we would use the known corrections for the case of an infinite system ) .    to perform the transition to the case of jellium with minimal changes we put the potential energy contributions of the protons  the p - p and p - e interactions in the exponent of the high - temperature density matrices  to zero .",
    "thus expression ( [ uenr ] ) is reduced to @xmath109 at the same time , the interaction terms @xmath110 and @xmath111 are retained as they produce the energy contribution of the `` background '' . with this , the proton component is treated as an ideal gas of given density and temperature with the proton number always matching that of the electrons , guaranteeing charge neutrality . with these trivial changes , expressions  ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ rho_s ] ) and ( [ ju ] )",
    "are well suited for efficient fermionic pimc simulations of jellium using standard metropolos monte carlo techniques ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in our monte carlo scheme",
    "we use three different types of moves , where either electronic @xmath112 or positive charge coordinates @xmath113 or the individual electronic beads , @xmath114 , are moved until convergence of the calculated values is reached .",
    "computer simulations of disordered systems , such as plasmas , require an accurate account of long - range coulomb forces which strongly affect the thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "accurate computer simulations require sometimes up to a million particles in the main monte carlo computation cell . moreover , the larger the number of charged particles in the main cell , the more acute is the problem of an efficient evaluation of the coulomb contribution . to reduce the effects of finite number of particles usually periodic boundary conditions ( pbc )",
    "are imposed on the main monte carlo cell .",
    "an essential problem in computer simulations of such systems is to properly combine the accurate account of long - range coulomb forces with pbc .",
