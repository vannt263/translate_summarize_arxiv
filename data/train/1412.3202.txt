    "it has long been known@xcite that carriers in a clean one - dimensional tight - binding band become localized @xcite if a uniform electric field @xmath0 is applied , since this breaks the free - particle continuum into a sequence of equally spaced discrete levels separated by the electric potential energy between consecutive sites @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the carrier s charge and @xmath3 the lattice constant .",
    "this discrete spectrum is the wannier - stark ( ws ) ladder.@xcite    while the ladder has been observed in semiconductor superlattices and in cold - atom systems,@xcite it is not seen in the spectra of regular crystalline solids .",
    "the absence of localization is easily understood in metals , because the fermi sea electrons screen out the electric field and carriers move ballistically as described by the buttiker - landauer theory@xcite ( if correlations can be neglected ) . in insulators , however , the electric field is not screened out and therefore the band is `` tilted '' . here , the absence of localization is attributed to coupling to the lattice : a carrier can emit phonons@xcite and thus lower its energy to slide along the chain , as sketched in fig .",
    "most previous work on this problem assumes incoherent tunneling between sites.@xcite for example , this is routinely done when modeling carrier transport in organic solar cells , based on the belief that those organic semiconductors are so disordered as to destroy coherence.@xcite while this assumption awaits validation , an understanding of the full quantum dynamics , which should be relevant in clean(er ) systems,@xcite is still needed .",

    ", we use scba to describe this string of phonons left behind as the carrier moves to lower energies , and combine it with the momentum average ( ma ) approximation to describe the phonon cloud that accompanies the carrier , turning it into a polaron .",
    "ma has been shown to provide a rather accurate description of the polaron properties for any e - ph coupling strength in an unbiased system , so long as the energy of the optical phonons , @xmath7 , is not too small.@xcite    we argue that taken together , these approximations allow us to understand the local density of states ( ldos ) in such a system if the bias @xmath8 is not large compared to @xmath7 .",
    "our results uncover the evolution of the ldos as the e - ph coupling is turned on , confirming that delocalization occurs as soon as such coupling is present .",

    "it should remain a reasonable assumption for the biased case as well if @xmath61 , since , as already discussed , we do not expect multiple phonons to be located at the same site with high probability .",

    "to check the validity of this approximation , we can use the same framework to implement other variational schemes and compare the results .",
    "for example , the solution of ref . can be trivially implemented by setting in the eom @xmath88 if @xmath89 , i.e. the carrier can not be to the left of the last emitted phonon ( this automatically implies @xmath90 ) . as a result",

    "( [ 10 ] ) . a priori",
    ", we do not expect this approximation to be that good for very small biases where the effective probabilities for the carrier to hop uphill vs. downhill are not that different .",
    "a wider variational space can be achieved by allowing the electron to go anywhere but keeping the additional restriction @xmath90 , i.e. the electron can move to the left of existing phonons but it can not emit additional phonons while there .",
    "since this is one of the ways to obtain multiple phonons at the same site , this approximation allows us to gauge the importance of contributions from configurations with multiple phonons at the same site .",
    "mathematically , the corresponding eom for this variational approximation ( which we label `` var '' in the following ) are obtained by removing the last term in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) when @xmath92 .",
    "its solution is like eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) but with @xmath93 in the denominator ( since no new phonons are emitted when the carrier moves to the left of existing phonons , the contribution from such paths is not renormalized by the self - energy @xmath94 ) .",
    "various other possibilities can be implemented similarly , by only keeping terms in the eom consistent with those assumptions , but we stop here .      for stronger electron - phonon coupling ,",
    "the probability to have multiple phonons at the same site must increase .",
    "this is known to be the case even for the un - biased system , because the electron creates a robust phonon cloud that accompanies it as it moves through the system .",
    "the resulting dressed quasiparticle is , of course , the polaron . in the biased system",
    ", one would expect the polaron to move down the ladder with its robust cloud .",
    "in such conditions , we expect that the approximation made above , of treating multiple phonons that happen to be at the same site as if they belong to different modes , to become quantitatively inaccurate because of normalization factors . to see why , consider a state with @xmath17 bosons at the same site .",
    "if they belong to the same mode , it is described by @xmath95 , and we have @xmath96 , etc . however , if we treat the @xmath17 bosons as belonging to @xmath17 distinct modes with one boson each , then there are no normalization factors .",
    "for small @xmath97 this makes little difference , but this is no longer the case if many bosons are likely to occur at the same site .",
    "thus , at moderate and large @xmath64 , the e - ph coupling has two consequences : one is to lead to the formation of the polaron with its robust cloud , and the other is to allow it to move to lower energies by leaving phonons behind . the number and typical locations of the phonons left behind is controlled by the ratio @xmath98 and therefore is not very sensitive to the strength of the coupling . as a result , we expect these processes to continue to be well described by the scba scheme , i.e. by assuming that these phonons are only involved in non - crossed diagrams .",
    "however , at any point the electron can start building a larger cloud in its vicinity ( the polaron cloud ) .",
    "since this cloud typically contains many phonons , it is unlikely that the electron will abandon it and move away to start building another robust cloud , at least not in the case @xmath99 that we consider here . instead , the electron will reabsorb these cloud phonons and then move to another location ( maybe leaving one phonon behind ) and start creating another robust polaron cloud , similarly to how it moves in an unbiased system .    in the unbiased system and for moderate and large e - ph coupling",
    ", it has been shown that the momentum average ( ma ) approximation@xcite provides an accurate description of the polaron properties so long as @xmath7 is not very small .",
    "for the holstein model , ma has been shown to correspond to the variational approximation of assuming that the polaron cloud has all its phonons at one site.@xcite this variational space can be enlarged systematically to check its validity . while for the holstein model this approximation is already very reasonable , for more complicated models of e - ph coupling one needs to allow the polaron cloud to spread over multiple adjacent sites.@xcite    here we implement an ma+scba approximation which assumes that a one - site polaron cloud can only be built at the location of the last emitted phonon , and that while a cloud with two or more phonons is present the electron will not emit / absorb phonons in other locations , consistent with ma . at the same time , phonons not in the cloud can only be absorbed in the inverse order to that in which they were emitted , as described by scba .",
    "mathematically , we implement this as follows .",
    "the eom remain unchanged as long as @xmath100 , i.e. no cloud is being built .",
    "equations ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) are supplemented with additional equations for the propagators with multiple phonons at site @xmath66 . specifically , for any @xmath101 , and using the shorthand notation @xmath102 where the first @xmath103 sites are all @xmath66 , we have:@xcite    @xmath104 \\\\ + ( p+1 ) g f_{k+p-1}(n_k ;   \\{n\\}_{p } ; z ) + g f_{k+p+1}(n_k ;   \\{n\\}_{p+2 } ; z)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    for @xmath70 , while for @xmath71 : @xmath105\\ ] ] these additional equations can be solved trivially and give : @xmath106 where @xmath107 the ansatz of eq . ( [ 9 ] ) remains unchanged if the last two phonons are not at the same site , and is supplemented by eq .",
    "( [ 9n ] ) if the last two phonons are at the same site .",
    "the rest of the solution proceeds as before and we find @xmath108    again , we will check this approximation against the variational predictions that do not allow the electron to move to the left of the rightmost phonon ( labeled as `` ref . [ 9 ] '' ) , respectively allow it to do so but not to emit additional phonons to the left of the rightmost one ( labeled as `` var '' ) .",
    "these are implemented just as before .",
    "another approximation we implement , which will be labeled as `` ma+scba dressed '' , is obtained by replacing @xmath109 everywhere in eq . ( [ ma ] ) . as its name suggests , this approximation allows the electron to start building additional non - crossed strings of phonons , which may include one - site larger clouds , while the original cloud is present , because it is obtained by replacing bare propagators by full propagators in eq .",
    "( [ ma ] ) . comparing it to the ma+scba results will allow us to gauge whether the assumption that such processes can be ignored is correct .",
    "we begin by analyzing a system with a small bias and small e - ph coupling , using the scba approximation .",
    "typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which plots the @xmath110 ldos for various values of @xmath111 , with ( thin black line ) and without ( thick red line ) an electric field @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",

    "figure [ fig2](a ) shows the @xmath116 results .",
    "as expected , the biased system s ldos shows discrete peaks at @xmath117 marking the ws ladder .",
    "some of these peaks are hard to see because their wave - function is very small at site @xmath110 .",
    "this is progressively the case for peaks with energies @xmath118 because of their localized nature .",
    "the ldos of the unbiased system is the usual 1d result , with a continuum of states for @xmath119 .",
    "as we turn the e - ph coupling on in panels ( b)-(d ) , the former ws states acquire a finite lifetime ( their width is no longer controlled by @xmath120 , instead being significantly larger even for @xmath121 , see change in the vertical scale ) , showing that these states are no longer localized .",
    "this proves that coupling to the lattice indeed results in delocalization . as @xmath64 increases",
    ", the peaks continue to broaden and start to merge into a smooth continuum .",
    "this occurs in an asymmetric way , with higher energy states converging faster towards a smooth ldos , while the lower energy states still show considerable ldos variation .",

    "arrows mark the top of the polaron band , also see inset .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    this may seem surprising at first , but the reason becomes clear when we compare with the ldos for @xmath6 ( thick red line ) , which has two features : a polaron band at low energies @xmath126 $ ] ( @xmath127 is the polaron ground - state energy ) and the polaron+one - phonon continuum for @xmath128.@xcite arrows mark the transition between the two features , which is barely visible on this scale for @xmath129 ( for the later case , it is shown more clearly in the inset ) .",
    "states in the polaron band describe the coherent , infinite - lifetime quasiparticle ( the polaron ) consisting of the carrier and its phonon cloud .",
    "in contrast , the polaron+one - phonon continuum contains incoherent states with finite lifetime , describing the scattering of the polaron on one or more phonons that do not belong to its cloud .    at first",
    ", one may expect that turning on an electric field should have a very different effect on the two types of states : the incoherent states at high energy should remain delocalized since the polaron already has enough energy to leave phonons behind and can continue to do so when the bias is applied .",
    "however , at low energies one may expect to see a ws ladder describing the localization of the polaron . indeed ,",
    "if here the polaron carries all the phonons in its cloud then it can not leave any of them behind , therefore the electric field should localize it just like it does with a bare particle .",
    "however , because the ldos at site @xmath17 is shifted downward by @xmath130 , it follows that such localized ws states could tunnel into the continuum that appears at the same energies for sufficiently large @xmath131 .",
    "in other words , such states can not be localized , instead they are at most resonances with a width controlled by the tunneling rate .",
    "if this is large compared to @xmath8 then the resonances merge into a smoother ldos , as we see for these parameters .",
    "indeed , as shown below , individual resonances spaced by @xmath8 can be recovered either by increasing @xmath8 , and/or by increasing the e - ph coupling , which makes the polaron very heavy and therefore greatly decreases its tunneling rate .    before looking at other parameters ,",

    "indeed , for the larger @xmath64 values these tunneling rates are so small that the spectrum ( at energies corresponding to the polaron band ) looks like a ws ladder with the proper spacing @xmath8 between resonances , as seen more clearly in the insets . at higher energies",

    "the two curves are very similar apart from a tiny shift due to the further renormalization of the polaron cloud allowed by the dressed approximation , which lowers its energy .",

    "[ fig7 ] we show results for cases with large bias @xmath133 and strong coupling of up to @xmath142 . individual resonances associated with different ws - like states again become visible at larger @xmath64 ( in particular , see feature appearing at @xmath7 below the polaron band ) but are much broader than for the small bias .",
    "this agrees with the trends observed at weak couplings , and is expected since a larger bias must lead to increased tunneling rates even for these heavy polarons .",
    "comparison between the different approximations , displayed in panel ( d ) , again shows good agreement .",
    "this suggests that the assumption implemented in scba to describe the phonons left behind , as the polaron moves further downhill , is still reasonable for a bias @xmath143 . in other words ,",
    "a phonon is left behind every few sites , with low probability for multiple phonons left at the same site or for phonons emitted later to be to the left of phonons emitted earlier . for significantly larger bias @xmath8",
    "one expects this assumption to start to fail , since in this case the carrier will need to emit many phonons at each site in order to lower its energy enough to be able to delocalize effectively . as a result , such cases can not be described accurately by the approximations we presented here .",
    "to summarize , we have implemented the scba approximation to describe the string of phonons left behind by a carrier in a biased system , in order to lower its energy to become delocalized .",
    "we argued that scba should be provide a reasonable description for these processes if the bias is not too large . increased coupling , however , also results in the dressing of the carrier by a phonon cloud that accompanies it as it moves through the system .",
    "here we used the simplest variational ma flavor to describe this cloud , combining it with scba to describe the phonons left behind .",
    "we also showed how this formalism can be modified to implement various other variational guesses that one might want to test , and used two possible versions to validate our hypotheses for certain parameter ranges .",
    "our results allow us to study the evolution of the spectrum as the bias and/or the e - ph couplings are turned on . in",
    "is worth noting that this hamiltonian is rather unusual in that it has an unbounded spectrum if the chain is infinite : moving further along the chain will lower the energy arbitrarily much .",
    "however , we can calculate the ldos and use it to understand the states available in the vicinity of one site .",
    "this can then be combined with the knowledge that at other sites the ldos looks similar , apart from the appropriate energy shift , to gain a global understanding of its evolution .",
    "we find that e - ph coupling always delocalizes the carrier , although for large coupling and small biases one can observe sharp peaks in the spectrum , that may be mistaken for localized states .",
    "as we argue , they are in fact resonances because of tunneling into delocalized states available further downhill .",
    "while this method has been used here to study a clean 1d chain , both scba and ma can be straightforwardly generalized to higher dimensions , allowing this formalism to be used to investigate problems that become progressively more difficult to study by numerical means.@xcite other types of e - ph coupling can also be studied by similar means,@xcite so that one could also investigate the relevance of the detailed modeling of the coupling to the lattice , on the behaviour of the carrier .",
    "finally , addition of anderson disorder is also straightforward to implement in this approach , and would open a way to investigate the competition between the localization promoted by disorder and the delocalizing effects of the e - ph coupling , away from perturbational regimes . indeed , we believe that the method we have proposed and developed here can be used to study efficiently yet quite accurately a varied range of interesting problems .          for eg ,",

    "note that the number of phonons at site @xmath66 is not necessarily @xmath103 , since in principle it is possible that the electron has been at site @xmath66 before and created a phonon , after which it moved to create phonons at other sites and only then returned to @xmath66 to create a cloud .",
