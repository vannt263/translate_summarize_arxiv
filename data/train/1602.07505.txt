    "<S> these entangled states are capable of improving a large variety of operations , e.g. , computational tasks @xcite , communication and measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlocking their full potential for quantum technologies requires both the generation and detection at the fundamental quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of such highly entangled states with many particles has witnessed tremendous advances @xcite . however , to fully exploit this quantum resource , the complete correlations on the single particle level need to be accessed , which still limits current experiments .    to address this challenge , </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear readout schemes have been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these employ a time inversion sequence . for this </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear evolution that is used to produce the entangled state is inverted and reapplied for readout . </S>",

    "<S> this nonlinear mechanism is the atomic analogue of parametric amplification , which is the textbook example of entangled state generation in quantum optics . at the same time , both the sign and the strength of the nonlinear coupling are experimentally adjustable , which makes this system ideally suited for realizing time reversal readout schemes .    </S>",

    "<S> is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) denotes the creation operator for the signal ( idler ) mode , @xmath11 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath12 is the effective nonlinear coupling strength .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling @xmath13 is related to the microscopic nonlinearity @xmath14 , arising from coherent collisional interactions and is enhanced by the number of atoms @xmath15 in the pump mode . in this undepleted pump approximation , the pump mode is treated classically and serves as an unlimited particle resource for parametric amplification of the side modes which bears no dynamics of its own . </S>",
    "<S> we work within the physical @xmath2 manifold because its associated nonlinearity @xmath14 is one order of magnitude larger than for @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> spurious processes out of the effective three level system are energetically suppressed by the quadratic zeeman shift at a magnetic field of @xmath17 g .    </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of this three - mode implementation is that the nonlinear hamiltonian can be tailored by controlling the phase and amplitude of this highly populated pump mode @xcite : the effective nonlinear coupling strength @xmath12 is inverted by imprinting a phase shift of @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 , while its magnitude can be adjusted by the number of pump atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore experimentally realize a scheme that is divided into three building blocks : entangled state preparation , interrogation , and nonlinear time reversal for readout [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . a characteristic quantity of the emerging entangled state is the fluctuation of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) denotes the amplified atom number in the respective mode . </S>",

    "<S> during which we inhibit spurious spin mixing . for this the pump atoms </S>",
    "<S> are transferred to @xmath25 using a microwave @xmath26-pulse that is much faster than the spin exchange . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the spin - mixing dynamics is halted and the pump is energetically shifted effectively by @xmath27hz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this energy shift to imprint a dynamical phase of @xmath18 onto the pump mode that changes the sign of the spin - changing collisions hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phase accumulation takes @xmath28ms . </S>",
    "<S> we then rapidly transfer the pump atoms back to @xmath4 and continue spin - changing collisions with identical coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> we find a pronounced minimum of the variance close to matched times of spin exchange , @xmath29 as expected for this nonlinear time reversal sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the observed remaining variance in the minimum corresponds to @xmath30 atom per side mode on average .    </S>",
    "<S> we now detail our first building block , which is the generation of the probe state . from a fundamental point of view </S>",
    "<S> , quantum - enhanced sensing relies on having entanglement at the probe stage - introducing entanglement solely after interrogation can not yield increased sensitivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we start spin - changing collisions with initially empty side modes , the process is analogous to optical parametric down - conversion , where amplifying vacuum fluctuations @xcite produces the paradigmatic two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this entangled state is described by @xmath31 , i.e. a coherent superposition of twin - fock states . within the undepleted pump approximation </S>",
    "<S> the weights @xmath32 are thermal - like , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mean atom number in either side mode after evolution time @xmath35 . because of the pairwise scattering during spin exchange , </S>",
    "<S> ideally both side modes are perfectly correlated , @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the side mode sum @xmath37 , however , features distinctive excess number fluctuations with corresponding variances of @xmath38 which are much larger than the poissonian noise level @xmath39 .    to experimentally characterize this generated state and its broad distribution , we repeat the experiment typically a few thousand times . </S>",
    "<S> this is facilitated by simultaneously preparing up to @xmath40 independent condensates in a one - dimensional optical lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> atom numbers are detected via state and lattice site resolved absorption imaging with an uncertainty of @xmath41 atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a typical raw image is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) . for quantitative analysis </S>",
    "<S> we postselect on total atom numbers in the range of @xmath42 atoms , corresponding to the initial pump population @xmath15 , in order to restrict the nonlinear coupling strength @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally confirm in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) that the variance of @xmath37 approaches the extreme value ( solid black line ) specific to the two - mode squeezed vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> we find perfect agreement for evolution times up to @xmath43ms . for larger evolution times pump depletion limits the variance growth , such that the analogy to optical parametric amplification eventually does not hold any more . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is well captured by a numerical simulation based on the truncated wigner method ( dashed ) .    </S>",
    "<S> optimal reversibility of the spin - mixing process is achieved for short evolution times or small total atom numbers such that pump depletion is negligible . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(e ) , we systematically vary the spin - mixing nonlinearity by shifting the postselection window ( @xmath44atoms ) on total atom number and adjusting the evolution time @xmath35 of the spin exchange , which gives rise to an effective evolution time of @xmath45 . after the nonlinear time reversal sequence ( blue ) we find good reversion to the initial vacuum state for a wide range of parameters </S>",
    "<S> the red diamonds show the sum variance immediately before time reversal .    </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic phase dependence of the entangling hamiltonian makes the entire scheme predestined for quantum - enhanced interferometry , where entangled states are employed to measure a phase shift more efficiently than classically allowed @xcite . in linear interferometry with classical probe states , the precision in measuring a phase difference @xmath46 between two modes @xmath47 and @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> is bound by the standard quantum limit ( sql ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase sensitivity is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the mean total atom number in both modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this limit can be overcome by exploiting the highly entangled two - mode squeezed vacuum as the input state , allowing phase estimation at the fundamental heisenberg limit , @xmath51^{-1}$ ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this precision can be reached by measuring the parity @xcite that necessitates single particle resolution . </S>",
    "<S> when having access to the global mean value only , a phase - dependent signal can not be retrieved at all .    in this work , we demonstrate that by using a nonlinear readout , the quantum resource can be harnessed by analyzing merely mean values . </S>",
    "<S> while number fluctuations of @xmath52 are necessary for a probe state to be sensitive to a phase difference @xmath46 @xcite , sensitivity to @xmath53 requires fluctuations of @xmath37 , as inherent to the two - mode squeezed vacuum state .    </S>",
    "<S> phase accumulation during interrogation changes the probe state according to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be captured by modified mode operators for the consecutive spin - changing collisions period : @xmath55 ( and similarly for @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the second hamiltonian evolution is characterized by a nonlinear coupling strength @xmath57 where @xmath58 is called the spinor phase . </S>",
    "<S> the initial evolution is reversed , @xmath59 if the well - controlled phase shift @xmath60 of the pump mode satisfies @xmath61 . therefore , by determining @xmath60 for which full time reversibility is reached , the unknown phase @xmath53 can be determined .    </S>",
    "<S> the general phase dependence of @xmath39 is the basis of the so - called su(1,1 ) interferometer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been proposed in the framework of nonlinear optics where it was realized recently @xcite with a bright seed in one side mode . here </S>",
    "<S> , using an atomic system @xcite [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ] we explore the regime of unseeded side modes leading to maximally entangled probe states @xcite .    to characterize the phase dependence we continuously change the pump phase in between two equal periods of spin - changing collisions ( @xmath62ms each ) . </S>",
    "<S> the probe state inside the interferometer is accessed by omitting the final spin mixing . </S>",
    "<S> its atom number distribution is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ( red ) featuring a mean atom number of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> all stated errors are statistical and are one s.d . without accumulated phase ( @xmath63 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the interferometer s output corresponds to an overall spin mixing for twice the initial period , with the population of the probe state inside the interferometer being further amplified by a factor of @xmath64 . compared to the ideal amplification factor of @xmath65 , this </S>",
    "<S> is reduced due to pump depletion . for phases close to @xmath66 , </S>",
    "<S> time reversal yields a state with strongly reduced mean atom number . </S>",
    "<S> each phase setting features the expected broad , non - gaussian number distribution representative of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the corresponding mean values ( dark colored bins ) give rise to an interferometry fringe ( lower panel ) .    the nonlinear time reversal maps the phase information onto the collective quantity @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the phase sensitivity of the entire device can be accessed by gaussian error propagation given by @xmath67 where only readily obtainable quantities enter .    . </S>",
    "<S> the standard quantum limit ( gray horizontal bar ) is surpassed in close vicinity of phase @xmath66 . at phase </S>",

    "<S> the undepleted - pump theory ( dashed ) additionally taking into account the nonperfect reversibility is shown as a solid line . </S>",

    "<S> ideally , for reaching larger absolute phase sensitivities at the fringe minimum the side mode population inside the interferometer can be increased as long as the nonlinear hamiltonian remains reversible which is strictly true only within the undepleted pump limit .    </S>",
    "<S> our findings point towards a new direction of accessing nonclassical resources for quantum metrology , employing highly controlled nonlinear dynamics for readout . </S>",
    "<S> specifically the aspect that entanglement generated by nonlinear dynamics is best readout by time reversal @xcite opens up a new class of entangled states to be experimentally accessible even in the many - particle limit of strongly correlated quantum systems . we envision the time reversal as a modular and powerful tool for entangled state characterization and exploitation in the continuous variable regime , where efficient linear detection schemes remain challenging .    </S>",
