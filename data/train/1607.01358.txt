    "studies of internal waves , such as sharp temperature gradients called thermoclines which separate oceanic bodies of water which are at different temperatures , are of significant interest to climatologists , marine biologists , coastal engineers , etc .",
    "the study of internal waves draws from previous single medium irrotational @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and rotational @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite studies and from appropriate studies of 2-media systems such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , these studies need to be extended to include the interaction between waves and currents .",
    "recent studies include the interaction between waves that propagate across the pacific ocean and the equatorial undercurrent ( euc ) @xcite , a hamiltonian formulation describing the 2-dimensional nonlinear interaction between coupled surface waves , internal waves , and an underlying current with piecewise constant vorticity , in a two - layered fluid overlying a flat bed @xcite and using shifted variables to transform a non - canonical wave - current system into a canonical system which has zero vorticity in the layers adjacent to the internal wave @xcite .",
    "this study aims to provide a hamiltonian formulation of a two - media bounded system which is rotational in the layers adjacent to the internal wave and hence show that wave - current interaction is influenced only by the current profile in this strip.",
    "the system under study consists of a 2-dimensional internal wave under the restorative action of gravity , which acts as a free common interface separating two fluid media , and a depth dependent current as per figure 1 .",
    "is assumed in layers i and iv.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the medium underneath the internal wave is defined by the domain @xmath1 .",
    "this medium is bounded at the bottom by an impermeable flatbed at a depth @xmath2 .",
    "the medium above the internal wave is defined by the domain @xmath3 .",
    "this medium is regarded as being bounded on top by an impermeable lid at a height @xmath4 , but in reality is a free surface with negligible wave amplitude . throughout the article",
    "the subscript @xmath5 will be used to mean evaluation for the lower medium @xmath6 , subscript @xmath7 means evaluation for the upper medium @xmath8 , subscript @xmath9 means evaluation for both media and subscript @xmath10 will be used to denote evaluation at the common interface .",
    "non - lateral velocity flow is described by @xmath11 .",
    "the arbitrary periodic function @xmath12 describes the elevation of the internal wave , i.e. @xmath13 is the equation of the internal wave .",
    "we define the mean of @xmath14 to be the shear surface at @xmath15 with the centre of gravity in the negative @xmath16-direction .",
    "a depth dependent current @xmath17 flows in @xmath6 and , correspondingly , @xmath18 flows in @xmath8 .",
    "currents are described for the system under study via the continuous function @xmath19 as @xmath20 for the positive constants @xmath21",
    ", @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is the velocity of the time - independent current at @xmath15 and @xmath27 is the non - zero constant vorticity for layers ii and iii , noting that the current is arbitrary in layers i and iv ( however represented by a continuous function everywhere ) .",
    "we consider a velocity field which is defined by : @xmath28 we have separated the wave and current contributions to the velocity and so we define @xmath29 as the wave velocity potential for @xmath30 and in particular the velocity components in layers ii and iii are [ 22 ] @xmath31 additionally , the stream function @xmath32 is introduced , defined by : @xmath33    @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the respective constant densities of the lower and upper media and stability is given by the immiscibility condition @xmath36    the rotationality of the layers ii and iii is given by the condition @xmath37 ensuring non - zero vorticity in this region . alternatively @xmath38 could also be considered for @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that for large @xmath40 the amplitude of @xmath14 attenuates and hence make the following assumptions @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43    i.e. the wave is localised in the _ strip_.",
    "we have the following equation ( euler s equation ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dynamic pressure , @xmath46 is the acceleration due to gravity ( where @xmath16 points in the opposite direction to the center of gravity ) and @xmath47 . the following bernoulli condition ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) at the interface follows from euler s equation and assumptions ( [ assump1 ] ) and ( [ assump1a ] ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the stream function evaluated at the interface . since the two media do not mix , @xmath50",
    ". moreover , @xmath51 is an arbitrary function of time and depends on how the potentials are defined at @xmath52 .",
    "clearly such a function can be absorbed in the definition of the wave potentials , but we will keep it separate for further convenience . we know by comparing ( [ phitilda_def ] ) and ( [ psi_def ] ) that @xmath53 and hence we can express the bernoulli condition in terms of wave and current components only as @xmath54    the terms with @xmath27 and @xmath24 are due to the wave - current interaction .",
    "for example , the second term is due to overall translation leading to a shift @xmath55 .",
    "the equation suggests the introduction of the variable @xmath56    where @xmath57 we also have the following kinematic boundary conditions at the interface , using the velocity representations @xmath58 noting that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where the subscripts @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote evaluation at the bottom ( lower boundary ) and lid ( upper boundary ) respectively .",
    "if we consider the system under study as an irrotational system the hamiltonian , @xmath63 , is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies as : @xmath64 the kinetic energy term for @xmath6 is @xmath65 which we can split into layers iv and iii , respectively , as @xmath66 for layer iv the kinetic energy is @xmath67 however , terms 3 - 7 combine to produce a constant which is irrelevant in terms of dynamic considerations ( does not contribute to the variations with respect to the field variables ) .",
    "moreover @xmath68 ( the mean deviation is by definition zero ) and the fields vanish at @xmath69 so that integration of total @xmath70 derivatives produces zero , thus @xmath71 for layer iii the kinetic energy is @xmath72 we write @xmath73 noting that @xmath74 can be properly re - normalised as @xmath75 as the variation in @xmath76 is zero .",
    "we introduce the dirichlet - neumann operator @xmath77 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the normal derivative of the velocity potential @xmath80 , at the interface , for an outward normal @xmath81 , and also define @xcite @xmath82 thus we can determine that @xmath83 the integral with @xmath84 term , using the leibniz integral rule with varying limits ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , can be written as @xmath85 and the @xmath86 term as @xmath87 and hence we write the hamiltonian for @xmath6 as @xmath88 we follow the same procedure for @xmath8 to obtain the corresponding energy as @xmath89 the total energy is therefore @xmath90 or in terms of ( @xmath14 , @xmath91 ) @xmath92 defining the hamiltonian which has no current or vorticity components , @xmath93 , as @xmath94 we can write @xmath95 the equations of motion can be written in hamiltonian form as follows . from ( [ kbc ] ) the dynamic boundary condition @xmath96    we note that the quantities in the bernoulli condition ( [ bernoullinew ] ) are @xmath97 and",
    "we can write it as    @xmath98    or due to as    @xmath99    noting the usual , not related to the current terms , @xmath100    and finally , from @xmath101    the equation for @xmath102 is given up to an arbitrary function of time because the hamiltonian can always be renormalised by a term @xmath103 which has a variation of @xmath104 with respect to @xmath14 but is otherwise zero by definition . thus , for the renormalised hamiltonian @xmath105    since @xmath106 after a change of variables @xcite via the transformation @xmath107 @xmath108    the system acquires a canonical hamiltonian form :    @xmath109    in conclusion we have shown that the wave - current is influenced only by the current profile in the strip ( layers ii and iii ) , i.e. outside this region the continuous current is arbitrary .",
    "the governing equations of a system of two - media , bounded on top by a lid and on the bottom by a flatbed , with an internal wave providing a free common interface and with a depth dependent current were written in a canonical hamiltonian form in terms of the wave-related variables @xmath110    it was then shown that the wave - current interactions are influenced only by the current profile in the strip , and do not depend on the current profile in the other layers .",
