    "we discuss measurements of the nuclear parton distributions via dijet ( jet@xmath0jet ) and @xmath2jet photoproduction in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in these collisions ,",

    "the virtuality , less than @xmath5 for nuclei with @xmath6 , can be neglected .",
    "since photon interactions are long range , they can interact with partons in the opposite nucleus even when the nuclei themselves do not interpenetrate . because the photon energies are less than those of the nucleons , these photonuclear interactions have a smaller average center of mass energy than hadronic parton - parton collisions .",
    "however , even though the energy is smaller , the coherent photon beams have a flux proportional to the square of the nuclear charge , @xmath7 , enhancing the rates relative to those of photoproduction in @xmath8 collisions at the same energy .",
    "thus photoproduction rates in heavy ion collisions can be high .",
    "photoproduction occurs two ways in heavy ion collisions : `` direct '' and `` resolved '' production . `` direct '' photoproduction occurs when a photon emitted from one nucleus interacts with a parton from the other nucleus .",

    "the photon components are described by parton densities similar to those used for protons except that no useful momentum sum rule applies to the photon @xcite .",
    "the quark and gluon constituents of the photon open up more channels for jet photoproduction and could , in principle , lead to larger rates for resolved production in certain regions of phase space .    in central collisions at rhic ,",
    "leading particles in jets are easier to detect above the high charged particle multiplicity background than the jets themselves since these high transverse momentum , @xmath11 , particles can be tracked through the detector @xcite . in peripheral collisions , especially at lhc energies , jets should be easier to isolate and may be observed directly using standard high energy jet detection techniques .",

    "the difference between the shadowing ratios for pions produced by quarks and antiquarks is rather large and reflects both gluon antishadowing at low @xmath11 as well as the relative valence to sea contributions for quark and antiquark production through @xmath299 . in the fgs calculations ,",
    "the antiquark ratio reflects the flattening of the antiquark and gluon ratios at @xmath105 .",
    "since pions produced by gluons come from the @xmath300 channel alone , only a small effect is seen , primarily in the emc region .",
    "now the total pion rates follow those for quark and antiquark production of final - state pions instead of those of the gluon .",
    "although our @xmath11-dependent calculations have focused on the midrapidity region of @xmath119 , we have shown that extending the rapidity coverage could lead to greater sensitivity to the small @xmath19 region and larger contributions from direct photoproduction , especially at low @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath263jet production is a good way to measure the nuclear quark distribution functions .",
    "direct photoproduction is dominant at central rapidities for moderate values of @xmath11 .",
    "final - state hadron production is somewhat larger for direct production so that , even if the rates are low , the results will be relatively clean .",
    "there are a number of uncertainties in our results .",
    "all our calculations are at leading order so that there is some uncertainty in the total rate , see refs .",
    "some uncertainty also arises from the scale dependence , both in the parton densities and in the fragmentation functions .",
    "the fragmentation functions at large @xmath182 also introduce uncontrollable uncertainties in the rates .",
    "hopefully more data will bring the parton densities in the photon , proton and nucleus under better control before the lhc begins operation .",
    "the data from rhic also promises to bring the fragmentation functions under better control in the near future .",
    "while the photon flux is also an uncertainty , it can be determined experimentally .",
    "the hadronic interaction probability near the minimum radius depends on the matter distribution in the nucleus .",
    "our calculations use woods - saxon distributions with parameters fit to electron scattering data .",
    "this data is quite accurate .",
    "however , electron scattering is only sensitive to the charge distribution in the nucleus .",
    "recent measurements indicate that the neutron and proton distributions differ in nuclei @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty in the matter distribution is likely to limit the photon flux determination .",
    "the uncertainty in the photon flux can be reduced by calibrating it with other measurements such as vector meson production , @xmath301 .",
    "studies of well known two - photon processes , like lepton production , can also help refine the determination of the photon flux .",
    "with such checks , it should be possible to understand the photon flux in @xmath302 relative to @xmath21 to better than 10% , good enough for a useful shadowing measurement .",
