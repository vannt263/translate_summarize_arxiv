    "constructions and computations of quantum field theory amplitudes have experienced tremendous progress , leading to powerful methods for evaluating loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these methods made computable many unknown amplitudes and provide an increasing knowledge of gauge theory and gravity amplitudes in various dimensions .",
    "these methods are based on the unitarity properties of the scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory .",
    "a quantum field theory amplitude is a multivalued function presenting branch cuts associated to particle production .    for local and lorentz invariant quantum field theories ,",
    "the matrix of diffusion @xmath0 is unitary @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the scattering matrix @xmath2 , defined as @xmath3 satisfies the relation @xmath4 .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the scattering matrix @xmath5 leads to unitarity relation on the perturbative amplitudes @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the imaginary ( absorptive ) part of the amplitudes @xmath6 is expressible as some phase integral of product of lowest order amplitudes through cutkosky rules  @xcite , and dispersion relation are used to reconstruct the full amplitude . in general the evaluation of the dispersion relations",
    "is difficult .",
    "fortunately , at one - loop order , in four dimensions , we know a basis of scalar integral functions @xmath7 specified by boxes , triangles , bubbles , tadpoles and rational terms  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are rational functions of the kinematics invariants .",
    "an interesting aspect of this construction is that the scalar integral functions have distinctive analytic properties across their branch cuts .",
    "for instance the massless four - point amplitude can get a contribution from the massless box @xmath10 , the one - mass triangles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the massive massive bubbles @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the finite part of these functions contain contributions with distinctive discontinuities that can be isolated by cuts @xmath15 higher - point one - loop amplitudes have dilogarithm functions entering the expression of the finite part , e.g. @xmath16 . picking a particular kinematic region",
    "@xmath17 , this function reduces to its branch cut behaviour @xmath18 which can be isolated by the cut .",
    "it is now enough to look at the discontinuities across the various branch cuts to extract the coefficients @xmath9 in  .",
    "the ambiguity has to be a rational function of the kinematic invariants .",
    "there are various methods to fix this ambiguity that are discussed for instance in  @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of having a basis of integral functions is that it permits us to state properties of the amplitudes without having to explicitly compute them , like the no - triangle property in @xmath19 supergravity  @xcite , or in multi - photon qed amplitudes at one - loop  @xcite .",
    "we hope that this approach can help to get a between control of the higher - loop amplitudes contributions in field theory . at higher loop order no basis",
    "is known for the amplitudes although it known that a basis must exist at each loop order  @xcite .",
    "feynman integrals from multi - loop amplitudes in quantum field theory are multivalued functions .",
    "they have monodromy properties around the branch cuts in the complex energy plane , and satisfy differential equations .",
    "this is a strong motivation for looking at the relation between integrals from amplitudes and _ periods _ of multivalued functions .",
    "the relation between feynman integrals and periods is described in  [ sec : periods ] .",
    "before considering higher loop integrals we start discussing tree - level amplitudes .",
    "tree - level amplitudes are not periods but they satisfy relations inherited from to the branch cuts of the integral definition of their string theory ancestor .",
    "this will serve as an illustration of how the monodromy properties can constraint the structure of quantum field theory amplitudes in yang - mills and gravity .",
    "an @xmath20-point tree - level amplitude in ( non - abelian ) gauge theory can be decomposed into color ordered gluon amplitudes    @xmath21    the color stripped amplitudes @xmath22 are gauge invariant quantities .",
    "we are making use of the short hand notation where the entry @xmath23 is for the polarization @xmath24 and the momenta @xmath25 , and @xmath26 denotes the group of permutations @xmath27 of @xmath20 letters modulo cyclic permutations .",
    "we will make use of the notation @xmath28 for the action of the permutation @xmath29 on the @xmath30 .",
    "the color ordered amplitudes satisfy the following properties    * flip symmetry @xmath31 * the photon decoupling identity .",
    "there is no coupling between the abelian field ( photon ) and the non - abelian field ( the gluon ) , therefore for @xmath32 , the identity we have @xmath33    these relations show that the color ordered amplitudes are not independent .",
    "the number of independent integrals is easily determined by representing the field theory tree amplitudes as the infinite tension limit , @xmath34 , limit of the string amplitudes @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ordered string theory integral @xmath37 in this integral we have made the following choice for three points along the real axis @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the domain of integration is defined by @xmath41 the function @xmath42 depends only on the differences @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "this function has poles in some of the @xmath43 but does not have any branch cut .",
    "since for generic values of the external momenta the scalar products @xmath45 are real numbers , the factors @xmath46 in the integrand require a determination of the power @xmath47 for @xmath48 @xmath49 therefore the different orderings of the external legs , corresponding to different choices of the permutation @xmath29 in  , are affected by choice of the branch cut .",
    "the different orderings are obtained by contour deformation of integrals  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a monodromy matrix that can simply expressed in terms of the _ momentum kernel _ in string theory  @xcite    @xmath50_{p } : =   \\prod_{t=1}^{k}\\ , { 1\\over\\pi\\alpha'}\\sin\\alpha'\\pi\\big(p\\cdot    k_{i_t}+ \\sum_{q > t}^{k } \\",

    "as a consequence of the proprieties of the string theory integral around the branch points one obtains that the color - ordered amplitudes satisfy the annihilation relations both in string theory and in the field theory limit @xmath57_1\\ ,    a_n(n,\\sigma(2,\\dots , n-1),1)=0\\,,\\ ] ] for all permutations @xmath58 .",
    "these relations are equivalent to the bcj relations between tree - level amplitudes  @xcite , and they imply that the all color - ordered amplitude can be expressed in a basis of @xmath59 amplitudes  @xcite .      in the same way one can express the gravity amplitude by considering string theory amplitudes on the sphere with @xmath20 marked points .    after fixing the three points @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "the @xmath20-point closed string amplitude takes the general form @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 arise from the operator product expansion of the vertex operators .",
    "they are functions without branch cuts of the differences @xmath66 and @xmath67 with possible poles in these variables .",
    "the precise form of these functions depends on the external states .",
    "changing variables to @xmath68 , one can factorize the integral ( we refer to  @xcite for details ) @xmath69 we now consider the deformations of the contours of integration for the @xmath70 variables given in figure  [ fig : contournested ] . because the contours can not cross each other we need to close them either to the right , turning around the branch cut at @xmath71 by starting with the rightmost , or close the contours to the left , turning around the branch cut at @xmath72 , starting with the leftmost .",

    "the independence of the amplitude under this choice is a consequence of the monodromy relations in eq .  .",
    "to get the full closed string amplitude  ( [ eq : defmn ] ) we need to multiply the left - moving amplitude of the @xmath79 integrations with the right - moving contribution from the integration over @xmath80 and then sum over all orderings to get @xmath81_{k_1 } \\mathcal{s}_{\\alpha'}[\\beta\\circ\\sigma(j,\\dots , n\\!-\\ !",

    "this provides a general form of the closed / open string relation between external gauge bosons and gravitons at tree - level .",
    "when restricted to the case of graviton external states the field theory limit of this expression reduces to the form derived in  @xcite .",
