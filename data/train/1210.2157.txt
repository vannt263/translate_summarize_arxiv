    "after the seminal works of a. zorich  @xcite and m. kontsevich  @xcite , it is known that the qualitative and quantitative features of the lyapunov exponents of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle over the teichmller flow on the moduli space of unit area abelian and quadratic differentials inspire several applications to different subjects such as :    * the description of the deviation of ergodic averages of interval exchange transformations ( @xcite , @xcite ) , * the computation of the diffusion rates of trajectories in the so - called ehrenfest wind - tree model for lorenz gases @xcite , * the distinction between commensurability classes of all presently known non - arithmetic ball quotients @xcite , etc .",
    "concerning the qualitative properties of the lyapunov spectrum of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle with respect to teichmller flow invariant probabilities , the so - called _ simplicity _ property , that is , lyapunov exponents have multiplicity @xmath1 , is one of the most prominent because , from the theoretical point of view , it gives the most complete picture of the fiber - dynamics of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle .",
    "indeed , by oseledets theorem , the simplicity property implies that the action of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle on almost every fiber can be completely diagonalized , and , for example , this is a important information in the applications to deviations of ergodic averages of interval exchange transformations .",
    "to the best of the authors knowledge , currently there exist two results for the simplicity of the lyapunov spectrum of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle .",
    "the first one is the celebrated theorem of a. avila and m. viana  @xcite ( proving the former kontsevich - zorich conjecture ) showing that the simplicity of lyapunov exponents of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle with respect to the so - called _ masur - veech _ probability measures .",
    "the second one is a recent result by the second author , m. mller and j .- c .",
    "yoccoz  @xcite giving a criterion ( inspired by the techniques of  @xcite ) for the simplicity of lyapunov exponents of invariant probability measures associated to the so - called _ arithmetic teichmller curves_.    a common technical feature of the proofs of simplicity in the papers  @xcite and  @xcite is the fact that they somehow depend on particular _ codings _ ( countable markov partitions ) for the teichmller geodesic flow that are well - adapted to the invariant probability measures at hand . in particular ,",
    "a. avila and m. viana  @xcite use the so - called rauzy - veech algorithm for their coding , and the second author , m. mller and j .- c .",
    "yoccoz  @xcite use certain finite extensions of the continued fraction algorithm for their coding .",
    "of course , the usage of a coding normally makes life technically easier , but it has a drawback coming from the fact that codings adapted to _ arbitrary _ invariant measures are not easy to produce in general .",
    "the goal of this note is the description of a `` coding - free '' simplicity criterion for invariant probabilities associated to teichmller curves ( i.e. , closed @xmath2-orbits ) .",
    "roughly speaking , given a teichmller curve @xmath3 , we show that the knowledge of the action on homology of affine diffeomorphisms of the translation surfaces in @xmath3 suffices to show the simplicity of the lyapunov spectrum _ without _ using any coding for the geodesic flow on @xmath3 . here",
    ", the basic idea allowing us to forget about codings is a theorem of h. furstenberg  @xcite ensuring that , given a lattice @xmath4 in @xmath2 , it is possible to find a probability @xmath5 on @xmath4 with @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath5 gives non - zero weights to all elements of @xmath4 ) such that @xmath7 is the poisson boundary of @xmath8 .",
    "this strategy was suggested to the first author by a.  furman many years ago .",
    "we organize this note as follows .",
    "in the next section , we quickly review some relevant definitions ( moduli spaces of abelian differentials , teichmller flow and @xmath2-action on these moduli spaces , kontsevich - zorich cocycle , teichmller curves , etc . ) , we state our main `` coding - free '' simplicity criterion ( see theorem  [ t.lyapunov ] ) , and we give the ( short ) proof of our simplicity criterion essentially by combining the results of h. furstenberg  @xcite on one hand , and y. guivarch and a. raugi  @xcite , i. goldsheid and g. margulis  @xcite , and a. avila and m. viana  @xcite .",
    "then , we make an application of the main criterion to a class of prym teichmller curves ( see theorem  [ t.prym ] ) where coding - based approaches are hard to perform ( because the veech groups of these teichmller curves are essentially unknown ) .",
    "finally , in the last section we show that our main criterion ( in theorem  [ t.lyapunov ] ) also applies to variations of hodge structures ( of weight two ) associated to mirror quintic calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "[ r.quadratic-diffs ] the natural analog of theorem  [ t.lyapunov ] below for teichmller curves in the moduli spaces of non - orientable quadratic differentials is also true .",
    "indeed , our proof of theorem  [ t.lyapunov ] can be easily adapted to the case of non - orientable quadratic differentials because these objects are naturally related to abelian differentials via the usual canonical double - cover construction .",
    "however , we prefer to leave the detailed verification of this fact to the reader since we will not need it for our current applications of the `` coding - free '' simplicity criterion .",
    "the basic references for the facts stated without proofs in this subsection are the surveys @xcite of g. forni and @xcite of a. zorich , and the references therein .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the moduli space of abelian differentials on riemann surfaces of genus @xmath10 , that is , @xmath9 is the set of equivalence classes of pairs @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath10 and @xmath13 is a non - trivial abelian differential ( non - vanishing holomorphic @xmath1-form ) on @xmath12 _ modulo _ the action of the group @xmath14 of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath12 .    in the literature ,",
    "the pairs @xmath11 are called _ translation surface structures _ because , by local integration of @xmath13 outside the set @xmath15 of its zeroes , one gets an atlas on @xmath16 such that the change of coordinates is given by translations .",
    "we refer to this atlas as a translation atlas .",
    "the translation atlases are useful structures because they make clear that the group @xmath17 acts on @xmath9 by post - composition with charts of translation atlases . as it turns out , from the point of view of ergodic theory , it is more efficient to study the @xmath17-action on @xmath9 by focusing on the `` unit hyperboloid '' @xmath18 of _ unit area _ translation surfaces in @xmath9 , that is , the translation surfaces @xmath19 such that the area function @xmath20 equals @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , despite the fact that this `` unit hyperboloid '' is not very far from @xmath9 ( one has to rescale the area of @xmath11 by multiplying @xmath13 by a constant to get in @xmath18 ) , it is preserved by the action of the subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath17 , and , furthermore , it is possible to show that @xmath18 supports plenty of @xmath2-invariant _ probability _ measures . in other words",
    ", @xmath18 is the correct object of study as far as ergodic - theoretical methods are concerned .    in what follows",
    ", we ll need the following two basic facts about @xmath18 and the corresponding @xmath2-action .",
    "firstly , @xmath18 is stratified into complex orbifolds @xmath21 of dimension @xmath22 obtained by collecting abelian differentials @xmath23 such that the list of orders of its zeroes is @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "secondly , the @xmath2-action on @xmath18 preserves each stratum @xmath26 .    in this language ,",
    "the _ teichmller flow _",
    "@xmath27 on a stratum @xmath28 of the moduli space @xmath18 is simply the action of the diagonal subgroup @xmath29 of @xmath2 . in their seminal works ,",
    "m. kontsevich  @xcite and a. zorich  @xcite introduced the so - called _ kontsevich - zorich cocyle _ over the teichmller flow , a fundamental object with applications to the dynamics of interval exchange transformations , translation flows and billiards .",
    "the definition of this cocycle is the following .",
    "firstly , one considers the _ teichmller space _",
    "@xmath30 of abelian differentials , that is , the set of equivalence classes of abelian differentials @xmath11 modulo the action of the group @xmath31 of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath12 isotopic to the identity .",
    "note that the moduli space @xmath9 is the quotient @xmath32 of the teichmller space by the action of the _ mapping - class group _ @xmath33 .",
    "the _ hodge bundle _",
    "@xmath34 over the moduli space @xmath9 is the quotient of the trivial bundle @xmath35 over the teichmller space by the diagonal action of the mapping - class group @xmath36 on both factors of @xmath37 . in this language",
    ", the kontsevich - zorich cocycle @xmath38 is the quotient @xmath39 of the trivial cocycle @xmath40)=(g_t(\\omega),[c])\\ ] ] on @xmath37 by @xmath36 .",
    "concerning the general features of the lyapunov spectrum , we observe that the kontsevich - zorich cocycle @xmath38 preserves the natural ( symplectic ) intersection form on the fibers @xmath41 of the hodge bundle @xmath42 . since @xmath41 is a real vector space of dimension @xmath43 , we have that @xmath38 is a symplectic cocycle and , thus , its lyapunov spectrum with respect to any teichmller flow invariant probability @xmath5 has the form @xmath44    also , it is not hard to check that the hodge bundle has a decomposition @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the `` tautological '' subbundle generated by the cohomology classes coming from the real and imaginary parts of @xmath13 and @xmath47 is the symplectic orthogonal of @xmath46 . furthermore , this decomposition is invariant under the @xmath48 action and the kontsevich - zorich cocycle .",
    "a simple geometrical argument allows one to show that the @xmath49-dimensional ( symplectic ) tautological subbundle @xmath46 contributes with the `` tautological '' lyapunov exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "also , g. forni @xcite proved the `` spectral gap '' estimate @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , one has that the lyapunov spectrum of @xmath38 with respect to any @xmath27-invariant probability @xmath5 has the form @xmath53 where the lyapunov exponents @xmath54 , @xmath55 come from the restriction of @xmath38 to the subbundle @xmath56 .    in the sequel , we ll be interested in the qualitative features of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , when @xmath5 is a @xmath2-invariant probability measure whose support is the smallest possible , namely , a single closed @xmath2-orbit , i.e. , a _",
    "teichmller curve_.      the basic reference for this subsection is the survey  @xcite of p. hubert and t. schmidt .",
    "let @xmath23 be a translation surface .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the stabilizer of @xmath11 with respect to the @xmath2-action on @xmath18 . in the literature , @xmath57 is called _ veech group _ of @xmath11 .    by a result of j. smillie ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it is known that the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath11 is _ closed _ in the moduli space if and only if the veech group @xmath57 is a _ lattice _ in @xmath2 . in this case , @xmath11 is called a _ veech surface _ and its @xmath2-orbit in the moduli space is isomorphic to the unit cotangent bundle @xmath58 of the ( finite - area ) hyperbolic surface @xmath59 . for this reason ,",
    "the closed @xmath2-orbits are called _ teichmller curves_.    by definition , the @xmath2-orbit of a veech surface ( i.e. , a teichmller curve ) supports an unique ( ergodic ) @xmath2-invariant probability measure .",
    "so , in the sequel , this measure will be always understood when we talk about the invariant measure associated to a given teichmller curve .    in general ,",
    "the veech group @xmath57 is part of an short exact sequence @xmath60 where @xmath61 , resp .",
    "@xmath62 , is the _ automorphism _ , resp .",
    "_ affine _ , group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath11 , that is , the set of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath11 preserving the set of zeroes of @xmath13 whose expression in the translation atlas of @xmath11 is a _ translation _ , resp .",

    "_ @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath11 has no ( non - trivial ) automorphisms , we have that @xmath57 is _ isomorphic _ to @xmath62 .",
    "this elementary fact has the following interesting consequence for the study of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle over teichmller curves .",
    "firstly , by using the duality between of the homology and cohomology , we can think of @xmath38 as the quotient of the trivial cocycle @xmath64 on @xmath65 by the action of the mapping - class group @xmath36 .",
    "secondly , it is possible to show that , in genus @xmath66 , the affine group @xmath62 injects into the mapping - class group @xmath36 . finally , one has that the stabilizer of the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath11 in @xmath36 is exactly @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath63 , the kontsevich - zorich cocycle @xmath38 over a closed @xmath2-orbit can be thought as the quotient of the trivial cocycle @xmath67 by the natural action of @xmath57 ( on the first factor it is the usual action and in the second factor the veech group acts via the injections @xmath68 ) .    in summary , the kontsevich - zorich cocycle over a teichmller curve is closely related to the action on homology of the affine group @xmath62 . in our subsequent discussion",
    ", we will systematically adopt this point of view on the kontsevich - zorich cocycle .",
    "note that , by poincar duality , @xmath38 leaves invariant a decomposition of the ( dual of the ) hodge bundle @xmath69 where the tautological @xmath49-dimensional symplectic subbundle @xmath70 carries the tautological lyapunov exponents @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the symplectic orthogonal of @xmath70 .    in the case of teichmller curves ,",

    "<S> in this note we show that the results of h. furstenberg on the poisson boundary of lattices of semisimple lie groups allow to deduce simplicity properties of the lyapunov spectrum of the kontsevich - zorich cocycle of teichmller curves in moduli spaces of abelian differentials without the usage of codings of the teichmller flow . as an application </S>",
    "<S> , we show the simplicity of some lyapunov exponents in the setting of ( some ) prym teichmller curves of genus @xmath0 where a coding - based approach seems hard to implement because of the poor knowledge of the veech group of these teichmller curves . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we extend the discussion in this note to show the simplicity of lyapunov exponents coming from ( high weight ) variations of hodge structures associated to mirror quintic calabi - yau threefolds . </S>"
