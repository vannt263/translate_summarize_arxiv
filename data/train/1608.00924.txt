    "a problem of central interest in current physics research is the study of quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium @xcite which recent experimental progress has made accessible in the laboratory @xcite . of particular interest is the problem of _ quantum quenches _",
    "@xcite , in which some parameter of the hamiltonian of an isolated quantum system is abruptly changed bringing the system in an out - of - equilibrium state . in this protocol",
    "the system is initialized typically in the ground state of the pre - quench hamiltonian and let to evolve following the post - quench hamiltonian . even though the evolution of a closed quantum system is unitary ( non - dissipative ) , in the thermodynamic limit the expectation values of local observables exhibit relaxation to a steady state .",
    "in a general system , relaxation is expected to lead to a thermal ensemble @xcite , but in the special class of _ quantum integrable models _",
    "@xcite this is not true . even though the expectation value of local observables exhibits relaxation @xcite , the steady state is not described by a thermal ensemble , but rather by a _ generalized gibbs ensemble _ ( gge ) @xcite that retains much more information about the initial state than the conventional gibbs ensemble which keeps only memory of the total energy .",
    "the fact that a large amount of information about the initial conditions is conserved through the time evolution is due to the defining property of integrable models , that possess an infinite number of independent _ local conserved charges _ @xmath0 .",
    "the relaxation of local observables to a suitable gge density matrix @xmath1 has been confirmed by many different studies @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the statement is that @xmath2\\ ] ] where on the left hand side , the expectation value @xmath3 is taken on the initial state and the local observables @xmath4 are evolved in the heisenberg representation up to time @xmath5 .    in the original proposal and in early studies of the gge",
    ", its density matrix was defined to include as constraints all _ local _ conserved charges @xmath0 : @xmath6 we will call this version _ local gge _ ( lgge ) to distinguish it from other versions introduced below .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath7 are fixed in such a way that the expectation values of the charges predicted by the gge is the same as the values at the initial time @xmath8 .",
    "early verifications of the gge in essentially non - interacting systems focused on the _ momentum - space _ version of the gge ( mgge ) @xmath9 which was typically expected to be equivalent to ( [ localgge ] ) . in fact this is true for non - interacting systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom since the conserved momentum - space occupation number operators @xmath10 are linear combinations of the local conserved charges @xmath0 and in one - to - one correspondence with them .",
    "more recently however , it was discovered that in genuinely interacting systems and in the presence of bound states , the gge as defined by ( [ localgge ] ) i.e. including only local conserved charges , gives incorrect results for general initial states @xcite and a larger class of conserved charges , the set of _ quasi - local charges _",
    ", must also be included in order for this _ complete or quasilocal gge _",
    "( qlgge ) to give the correct description of the steady state @xcite .",
    "@xmath11    local charges ( sometimes called _ ultra - local _ ) are defined as spatial sums ( integrals , in the continuum ) of local charge - densities , i.e. operators with spatial support within a finite number of neighbouring lattice sites ( operators involving only a finite order of spatial derivatives at a single point , in the continuum ) . in lattice systems",
    "milder forms of locality have been considered arriving at the definitions of _ pseudolocal _ and _ quasilocal _ charges @xcite .",
    "pseudolocal charges are defined through extensivity of their operatorial norm and include as special cases the quasilocal and the local charges .",
    "locality properties of the quasilocal charges lay in between the weakest definition of pseudolocality and the strongest concept of locality : like local charges , they can be written as a sum on the lattice of a quasilocal density .",
    "quasilocal densities , in contrast with the local ones , can couple lattice sites infinitely far apart , but the strength of this coupling is exponentially damped with the distance .    while a _ complete gge _ @xcite that includes quasi - local charges has by now been established as the correct description of the steady state in lattice and spin chain systems , the situation is less clear in continuous integrable systems .",
    "quasi - local charges for continuous quantum field theories were first introduced in @xcite and it was argued that not all physically meaningful initial states would relax to a gge that can be expressed in terms of local charges . instead quasi - local charges may be needed in general .",
    "moreover it had been already shown earlier that local charges may be ill - defined ( ultraviolet divergent ) for some very natural choices of initial states @xcite .    in order to check",
    "if a lgge gives a correct description of the steady state , here we will focus on interacting - to - free quantum quenches .",
    "in particular we will assume that the evolution follows the simplest relativistic massive bosonic field theory , the klein - gordon theory . despite the absence of interactions during the evolution , in fact",
    "the presence of arbitrary interactions in the initial state makes the problem non - trivial . in the present work",
    "we show that independently of the uv issues of the local charges there is no relativistic interacting - to - free quench whose steady state can be fully described by a lgge , since the latter fails to describe correctly the steady state correlation functions ; instead the inclusion of quasilocal charges is a necessity and the qlgge gives indeed the correct description for this broad class of quenches .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that for any quench of the above type whose initial state satisfies the cluster decomposition principle , the corresponding steady state is always given by the momentum - space form ( [ momentumgge ] ) ( see also @xcite for extensions ) .",
    "clustering of correlations is a general feature of ground states of local quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "its crucial role for the validity of gaussian relaxation had been already pointed out in analogous studies of interacting - to - free quenches in bosonic lattice models @xcite and more recently in fermionic ones @xcite .",
    "the first question we wish to address here is if the exact steady state of the form ( [ momentumgge ] ) can be recast into the ultra - local form ( [ localgge ] ) as frequently assumed .",
    "already by studying the simplest possible example , a mass quench , we will demonstrate that the two forms are not equivalent . by comparing the klein - gordon model with its lattice version , i.e. a system of harmonic oscillators with short - range couplings",
    ", we realize that the above described discrepancy disappears : the lattice version of ( [ localgge ] ) is indeed equivalent to the corresponding lattice version of ( [ momentumgge ] ) .",
    "we will then show in full generality that the failure of ( [ localgge ] ) in the continuum is not an accidental peculiarity of this special type of quench , but it is always present for any choice of the pre - quench interaction .",
    "our proof uses the kllen - lehmann spectral decomposition of the initial state and relies on the observation that the ultra - local gge ( [ localgge ] ) written in momentum space imposes analyticity requirements on @xmath12 that are inconsistent with the correct form .",
    "more importantly we will show that their difference is essential and physically relevant in the sense that ( [ localgge ] ) gives incorrect predictions for the two point correlation function in the steady state , not only at finite but even at large distances .",
    "we emphasize that a basic qualitative characteristic like the long distance correlation function is precisely what a field theoretic approach is supposed to capture .",
    "having shown these negative statements , we next adopt a constructive approach : we show that the steady state ( [ momentumgge ] ) can be expressed in terms of quasi - local charges and we address the question `` how much non - local the correct gge is '' . in this perspective , we describe the spatial spread of the quasilocal charges that mostly contribute to the gge and find a natural exponential cut - off , whose typical length is given by the minimum between the pre - quench and post - quench masses .",
    "to demonstrate our argument in the simplest possible example , in this section we consider a quantum quench of the mass parameter in the klein - gordon field theory .",
    "this quench has been studied in @xcite and the steady state is known in the momentum - space form ( [ momentumgge ] ) so that we can directly check if it is possible to express it in the ultra - local form ( [ localgge ] ) .",
    "we find that this is impossible and in particular we show that any ultra - local gge would always give incorrect predictions for the large distance asymptotics of the two - point correlation function .",
    "we study in parallel the equivalent quench in the lattice version of the model , which is nothing but a system of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "as we will see , the discrepancy between the ultra - local gge and the exact steady state is absent in the lattice version , meaning that the problem arises only in the continuum limit .",
    "we consider the klein - gordon model in one spatial dimension which is described by the lagrangian @xmath13 in this simple model , the local charges are quadratic in the fields @xcite : @xmath14\\phi=\\int \\frac{dk}{2\\pi}\\;k^{2n } e(k)a^\\dagger_k a_k\\label{lch}\\ ] ] @xmath15    the system is initialized in the ground state of the model with mass @xmath16 and then the mass parameter is changed to @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is readily written as : @xmath18 in standard notation : @xmath19 is the field conjugate to @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the creation and annihilation operators with standard bosonic commutation rules @xmath22=2\\pi\\delta(k - q)$ ] .",
    "the above hamiltonian admits an obvious lattice discretisation in terms of coupled harmonic oscillators : @xmath23 in the lattice model the integral is constrained in the first brillouin zone @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the dispersion relation in the two cases is : @xmath26 as shown in @xcite the relation between the pre - quench creation and annihilation operators @xmath27 and the post - quench ones @xmath28 is a bogoliubov transformation @xmath29 where the index  0 \" denotes the pre - quench dispersion relation that corresponds to mass @xmath16 .",
    "the initial state expectation values of the conserved momentum - mode occupation number operators @xmath30 is therefore @xmath31 the formally divergent @xmath32 term comes from the commutator @xmath33=2\\pi\\delta(0)$ ] and , as standard in quantum field theory , it can be cured by a simple finite volume regularization @xmath34 @xcite , with @xmath35 the ( infinite ) volume of the system . clearly this regularization results in an extensive expectation value of the hamiltonian , as it should be . for convenience",
    "we dispose of the volume factor embedding it in the definition of the density of excitations @xmath36 , in this way : @xmath37    using ( [ new31 ] ) we can immediately understand that a straightforward application of the lgge recipe is problematic . as a matter of fact the computation of the lagrange multipliers associated with the local charges passes through the expectation values of the latter , but the defining integrals ( [ lch]-[lchbis ] ) are uv divergent , since @xmath38 for large @xmath39 .",
    "a possible strategy could be to regularize the state with a sharp or smooth uv cut - off , that could arise naturally if the field theory is thought of as a continuous approximation of a discrete system : in this case the uv cut - off is of the order of the inverse lattice spacing . in this a way the charges have finite expectation values and we may be able to fix the lagrange multipliers , which now would be cut - off dependent .",
    "the determination of the lagrange multipliers is a rather difficult task , which however is completely unnecessary for our goal .",
    "it must be stressed that the actual question regarding the validity of the lgge is not if the excitation density can be fixed by the knowledge of @xmath40 , but if @xmath41 is compatible with a lgge in the form ( [ localgge ] ) .",
    "in fact we will show that , without explicitly deriving the lagrange multipliers , the lgge form imposes strong analytic constraints that are sufficient in order to compare it with the exact one as given by the mgge and to obtain information about the large distance behaviour of correlators .",
    "from this comparison we can easily see that the lgge is not equivalent with the exact steady state which is given by the mgge ( [ momentumgge ] ) .",
    "the excitations densities in the mgge are : @xmath42 imposing @xmath43 we compute the lagrange multipliers or  effective temperatures \" @xmath12 @xmath44 we note that @xmath12 is an even function of @xmath39 as it should be , since the initial state is parity invariant .",
    "a lgge ( [ localgge ] ) in the continuum is constructed using an infinite sum of the local charges .",
    "due to parity invariance only the even charges @xmath45 defined in ( [ lch ] ) enter in this construction . writing this sum in momentum space we have @xmath46",
    "so that , comparing the lgge ( [ localgge ] ) with the mgge ( [ momentumgge ] ) , we identify the lgge prediction for @xmath12 as @xmath47    we conclude that the momentum - dependent effective temperature @xmath12 for a lgge is necessarily defined through a power series , regardless the actual values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath48 and of the uv regularization used to compute them .",
    "conversely , in order for the exact steady state , which is given by the mgge , to be equivalent to a lgge , @xmath12 must be a power series in terms of @xmath49 . while it is true that @xmath12 of ( [ new32 ] ) can be taylor expanded around zero , the radius of convergence @xmath50 of this series is @xmath51 , because this is the distance from the origin of the closest of the branch - cut singularities of ( [ new32 ] ) , which are located at @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the correct effective temperature ( [ new32 ] ) can not be described through an unique power series valid for any momentum and therefore it is not compatible with a lgge .",
    "this may not seem to be a serious problem , since the gge is supposed to describe correctly only local observables , not global ones like momentum - space quantities .",
    "however @xmath54 is directly linked through fourier transform to the steady state two - point correlation function @xmath55 which _ is _ a local observable .",
    "in particular , the non analyticity point of the excitation density closer to the real axis determines the long - distance decay of the two - point correlator , as it will be explained in section [ mainsec ] in the more general situation of an arbitrary pre quench theory . as a result",
    "the above discrepancy becomes evident in the long - distance asymptotic behavior , which is what any continuous qft is expected to capture .",
    "we now study the lattice system : the local charges are a simple discretization of the continuum case and as before only the even charges are needed .",
    "@xmath56 therefore , a lgge on the lattice can be written in the momentum space as : @xmath57    in marked contrast to the continuum case , in the lattice we reach the conclusion that in order for the lgge to be equivalent to the mgge the effective temperature @xmath12 must be a _",
    "fourier series _ of @xmath39 instead of a power series . the correct effective temperature is still given by ( [ new32 ] ) with @xmath58 and @xmath59 replaced by the lattice dispersion relation .",
    "we notice that this is a smooth function in @xmath39 in the brillouin zone for any @xmath60 , therefore it possesses a _",
    "uniformly convergent _ fourier series @xcite .",
    "this means that , unlike the continuum case , in the lattice the lgge is equivalent to the correct mgge .",
    "comparing these two models we can have a better understanding of the continuum limit .",
    "heuristically to pass from the lattice to the continuum we would make the correspondence @xmath61 , then taylor expand the field when its position is shifted by a finite number of sites @xmath62 and find the continuum local charges as linear combinations of those on the lattice . as already pointed out in @xcite , this is not the only way to take the continuum limit : we can consider a combined limit for @xmath63 , letting @xmath64 but keeping @xmath65 constant , thus naturally finding the bosonic analogue of the set of quasilocal charges introduced in @xcite .",
    "@xmath66 we write only the even charges , but of course a similar operation can be performed on the odd ones .",
    "it is straightforward to verify from scratch that the quasilocal charges @xmath67 are indeed integrals of motion of the continuum model .",
    "moreover they are complete in the sense that they are sufficient in order to describe the mgge @xmath68 and the fourier transform of @xmath12 given by ( [ new32 ] ) is well defined . of course , for a quench protocol that breaks parity invariance we must use also the odd charges .    apart from demonstrating that local charges are insufficient to describe the steady state of the mass quench and that quasilocal charges are instead complete , it is useful to quantify how much nonlocal the gge is i.e. how far from local the kernel @xmath69 must be in order to describe the correct steady state as given by the mgge for the mass quench .",
    "obviously considering an arbitrary kernel @xmath69 in ( [ newsp20 ] ) allows for quite nonlocal features , e.g. in the extreme case of a constant kernel points that are infinitely far away would be coupled .",
    "understanding how fast @xmath70 decays is important from the viewpoint of a truncation of the gge @xcite , when we are interested only on observables within a finite subsystem : in practice , we can not measure experimentally @xmath71 for any @xmath72 , therefore knowing in advance whether or not the contribution of @xmath67 is negligible would be very helpful .    using the parity invariance of the effective temperature",
    ", @xmath69 can be computed as : @xmath73 so that the large distance behavior of @xmath69 can be readily estimated from the non - analyticity points of @xmath12 in the complex plane .",
    "since @xmath69 is symmetric in its argument we can suppose @xmath74 , then we can move the integration path in the upper complex plane , integrating around the non - analyticity points and branch - cuts .",
    "the non - analyticity point closest to the real axis determines the leading behavior of @xmath70 at large distances .",
    "in particular , if this point has imaginary part @xmath75 , then @xmath70 is exponentially damped @xmath76 , in general with extra non - exponential corrections . from the expression of the effective temperature ( [ new32 ] ) with the relativistic dispersion relation",
    ", we see that the first non - analyticity point is a branch - cut singularity at @xmath39 equal to the smallest mass among @xmath17 and @xmath16 , therefore : @xmath77    therefore even though all quasilocal charges @xmath67 should in principle enter in the construction of the gge , we have a very natural cutoff in terms of the smallest mass involved . in particular , the larger the masses are , the closer the mgge or the equivalent qlgge is to a lgge , since only quasilocal charges with a smaller spread are needed .    apart from the long distance behavior , we can also easily characterize @xmath69 at short distances , showing that it is logarithmically divergent . at large momenta @xmath12",

    "we show that the lgge is never sufficient to correctly describe the steady state in continuous field theories , we explain how we can see the discrepancy in correlations of local fields and finally we quantify the non - locality properties of the quasilocal charges that are required for the correct description .",
    "in the previous section we showed how local charges are insufficient to correctly describe the steady state of a mass ( free - to - free ) quench , but actually we can reach the same conclusion in the more general case of any interacting - to - free quench .",
    "we will consider a single bosonic field in one dimension with an arbitrary pre - quench interacting theory : @xmath82\\hspace{1pc}\\xrightarrow{t=0}\\hspace{1pc}\\mathcal{l}_{t>0}=\\int dx\\hspace{3pt } \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi - m^{2}\\phi^{2}\\right)\\label{new3}\\ ] ]    interacting to free quenches in field theory have already been studied @xcite and it has been shown that , whenever the post - quench lagrangian is massive ( @xmath83 ) and the initial state satisfies the cluster property , we have equilibration of local observables to the gaussian mgge ( [ momentumgge ] )",
    ". if the post - quench theory is instead massless ( @xmath84 ) the situation is more complicated and the system relaxes to a non gaussian ensemble @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will focus only on the massive post - quench case .",
    "this quench protocol is parity invariant , therefore we can consider only even charges in the construction of the lgge : in the previous section we showed how lgge implies analyticity constraints on the effective temperature @xmath12 . our strategy is to check whether or not these constraints are consistent with @xmath85 . in the mass",
    "quench @xmath86 was known explicitly thanks to the fact that the pre - quench theory was free . in this more general case",
    "we can not perform this task explicitly , nevertheless the knowledge of the analytic properties of @xmath86 will be sufficient for our purposes and we can obtain such information using the _ kllen - lehmann spectral representation _ for the correlators of @xmath20 and @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "this representation is exact ( not perturbative ) and relies only on relativistic invariance , providing an integral representation for the two point correlators of the fields @xmath20 and @xmath87 in terms of a _ spectral density _",
    "@xmath88 : @xmath89 above @xmath90 , @xmath91 are the fourier transforms of the fields and the @xmath35 factor comes from the usual finite volume regularization of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the spectral density is real and positive .",
    "it exhibits @xmath92like singularities in correspondence with the masses of the particles of the pre - quench theory and it has thresholds in correspondence with multiparticle states ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath93     is nonzero , in the simplest case of only one particle of mass @xmath16 .",
    "the spectral function presents a @xmath92like singularity in correspondence with the one particle state @xmath94 , then multiple thresholds in correspondence with multiparticle states , therefore starting at @xmath95 with @xmath96 . ]    above , @xmath97 are the unknown masses of the particles of the pre - quench theory and they are supposed to be ordered @xmath98 , @xmath99 are the field renormalization parameters and they are positive quantities . the continuous threshold starts from the minimal energy of a two particle state , that is @xmath100 . above",
    ", @xmath101 is a heaviside step - function and other thresholds are hidden in the function @xmath102 in correspondence with multiparticle states of higher mass particles .",
    "it is useful to mention @xcite that the spectral density is normalized to @xmath103 : @xmath104 using the parity invariance of @xmath86 and ( [ new21 ] ) we get : @xmath105    it must be stressed that the use of the kllen - lehmann spectral decomposition allows us to go beyond perturbation theory and in particular to compare the lgge and mgge _ directly in the renormalized theory _ , that is after the uv divergent constants ( masses , field strengths etc . ) have been correctly regularized in the limit of infinite uv cut - off .",
    "nevertheless notice that the expectation values of the local charges still remain uv divergent , as it happens also in the free case of section [ massquench ] , meaning that local charges are not renormalisable by means of standard renormalization group theory .",
    "therefore the same problems in the computation of the lgge s lagrange multipliers are still present .    instead of considering the excitation density , it is more convenient to study the analytic behavior of a slightly different quantity : @xmath106,\\ ] ] besides allowing a more straightforward comparison between the mgge and lgge analyticity predictions , we will see that this quantity is related to the fourier transform of the two - point field correlator and different analytic behaviors of lgge and mgge will be translated into differences in the large distance behavior of the two point correlator .    of course , @xmath85 is equivalent to @xmath107 : in the following we will show that this equality is in fact impossible .",

    "moreover poles determined by the solutions of ( [ new36 ] ) may be present symmetrically located with respect to the origin , since ( [ new36 ] ) is even in @xmath39 . ]    ) for a lgge expectation value : two branch - cuts are present starting from @xmath52 .",
    "the integrand diverges at the branch - cut points due to the presence of the extra factor of @xmath142 in ( [ new33 ] ) .",
    "moreover poles determined by the solutions of ( [ new36 ] ) may be present symmetrically located with respect to the origin , since ( [ new36 ] ) is even in @xmath39 . ]",
    "* pre - quench mass smaller than post - quench mass , * @xmath143 : + in this case , the correct long distance behavior which is given by the mgge ( figure [ ldfig2 ] ) is determined by the branch - cut singularity at @xmath144 . thanks to ( [ new34 ] ) , we know that this is a square root singularity and the long distance behavior can be readily derived : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the positive field - strength renormalization constant associated with the @xmath147-singularity of @xmath88 at @xmath148 ( [ kl30 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the prediction of a lgge ( figure [ ldfig1 ] ) can not be matched with this asymptotic behavior : the branch - cut at @xmath149 results in an exponentially decaying factor @xmath150 that is incorrect compared to ( [ new39 ] ) .",
    "the only way in which we could capture the correct exponential behavior of ( [ new39 ] ) would be to choose the effective temperature in such a way that a first order pole appears at @xmath144 , but even then such a pole would give a plain exponential decay and it would never capture the algebraically decaying factor @xmath151 of ( [ new39 ] ) .",
    "pre - quench mass larger than post - quench mass * , @xmath152 : + in this case the leading behavior of the exact two point correlator ( figure [ ldfig2 ] ) is not given by the branch - cut , but by the pole at @xmath149 .",
    "instead , the branch - cut at @xmath144 gives subleading corrections : @xmath153 where the constant @xmath154 is : @xmath155 consider now the long distance behavior predicted by a lgge ( figure [ ldfig1 ] ) : this time the branch - cut is in the right position to give the exponentially decaying factor @xmath150 , but it would not be a pure exponential decay , since we are dealing with a branch - cut and not with a pole . even if we adjusted the effective temperature to obtain the correct leading behavior , the subleading term will not be exponentially damped @xmath156 as predicted by the correct computation ( [ new40 ] ) . in this case",
    "the lgge fails to catch the correct subleading behavior of the two point correlator at large distances .",
    "now we consider what happens in the presence of a finite radius of convergence @xmath50 .",
    "as explained earlier , for real @xmath39 outside of the convergence disk i.e. @xmath157 the only meaningful possibilities are @xmath158 . in this case",
    "the two point correlator is : @xmath159    the second term , in the large distance limit is exponentially damped @xmath160 .",
    "consider instead the first term : @xmath123 is well defined and analytic in the whole interval , therefore we can consider the analytic continuation of the integrand to the whole complex plane .",
    "in particular , @xmath111 is analytic in the whole disk of radius @xmath50 : the large distance behavior of the first term can be computed deforming the integration path in the complex plane , enclosing the non - analyticity points , but in contrast to the previous analysis the integration path is constrained inside the disk ( figure [ analyticr ] ) .",
    "the leading behavior of the two point correlator is no more exponentially damped : differently from before , we can not lift the integration path from the real axis and we are forced to touch it at the edges of the disk , therefore the end points of the integration contour give a contribution that decays slower than exponentially .",
    "actually , if the radius of convergence is taken very large , it could happen that the magnitude of the contributions given by the edges of the integration path is very small , in particular vanishing in the limit @xmath161 . in this perspective , to compute the asymptotic decay of the two point correlator we should rather look at the non analyticity points inside the disk and therefore we come back to the previous discussion .",
    "overall we conclude that the lgge fails not only quantitatively , but also qualitatively , to predict the correct asymptotic behavior for the long distance correlator .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that a local gge always fails to describe correctly interacting - to - free quenches in continuous relativistic field theories .",
    "then , studying the long distance behavior of the two point correlator , we realised that such a failure is not only quantitative , but even qualitative .",
    "in this perspective , we are forced to reject the use of a lgge and we always have to take into account the quasilocal charges ( [ newsp20 ] ) . as we did for the mass quench ,",
    "we want to verify that the mgge can indeed be expressed as a qlgge and study the decay of @xmath69 ( [ newsp20 ] ) . to verify that quasilocal charges correctly describe the exact steady state i.e. the mgge , we should verify that it is possible to compute the fourier transform of the effective temperature . using the kllen- lehman spectral decomposition ( [ new26 ] )",
    "we see that @xmath12 has no singularities for real @xmath39 and moreover it is easy to see that @xmath86 decays algebraically for large momenta .",
    "we therefore have that for large momenta @xmath162^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\ ] ]    this guarantees that the effective temperature has a proper fourier transform and therefore @xmath163 is well defined ( [ newsp37 ] ) for any @xmath164 , but it has the same logarithmic divergence in @xmath165 as in the free mass quench , once we substitute in ( [ newsp24 ] ) the new definition of @xmath166 .",
    "we can now study the decaying properties of @xmath70 : exactly as we did for the mass quench in section [ massquench ] , the non - analyticity point of @xmath12 closest to the real axis rules the large distance behavior of @xmath70 . from ( [ momentumgge ] )",
    "we can express @xmath12 in terms of @xmath86 : @xmath167    using ( [ new26 ] ) and ( [ new19 ] ) , we can readily see that @xmath12 acquires the non - analyticities of the spectral density , but additional logarithmic branch - cuts may appear too . however , it is possible to show that in the strip @xmath168 ( where @xmath16 is the minimum among the pre quench masses ) there are no logarithmic branch cuts .",
    "since there is surely a branch cut at @xmath169 due to the presence of the square roots , this information is enough to extract the long distance behavior of @xmath163 : @xmath170 where we neglect non exponential corrections .",
    "the inverse masses of the pre - quench and post - quench theory provide the minimum length scale required for an effective truncation of the quasilocal charges that should be included in the qlgge . retaining quasi - local charges up to the minimum mass scale",
    "is expected to give a good description of the two point correlator , nevertheless any truncation would fail to exactly capture its asymptotic behavior .    in order to show the absence of logarithmic branch cuts in the strip @xmath168 we can argue as follows : we choose the logarithmic branch cut of @xmath171 to start from @xmath172 and to reach @xmath173 along the real axis , therefore the branch cut",
    "is crossed every time the @xmath174 and @xmath175 changes its sign . as a first step we can find regions in the complex plane such that the imaginary part of the analytical continuation of the excitation density is different from zero :",
    "in these regions there is no logarithmic branch cut .",
    "looking at ( [ new19 ] ) , this is possible if and only if @xmath176 .",
    "thanks to ( [ new26 ] ) we have : @xmath177=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mu^{2}\\ ; \\rho(\\mu^{2})\\;\\im\\left[f\\left(\\frac{2}{|m^2-\\mu^2|}\\left[k^2+\\frac{m^2+\\mu^2}{2}\\right]\\right)\\right]\\label{log1}\\ ] ] where the complex function @xmath178 is defined to be : @xmath179    since the spectral density is real and strictly positive , a non vanishing imaginary part of the excitation density is guaranteed as soon as the imaginary part of the integrand has a constant sign for all values of @xmath180 in the support of @xmath88 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath178 has a constant sign in each quadrant of the complex plane and this allows us to identify regions where the imaginary part of the excitation density is not zero .",
    "for example the first quadrant @xmath181 in terms of the complex momentum @xmath39 is identified as : @xmath182    solving the first inequality with respect to the imaginary part and requiring the inequality to be satisfied for any @xmath180 in the support of the spectral density we find a region in the complex plane of the momentum such that the imaginary part of the excitation density is never zero .",
    "considering also the inequalities coming from the other quadrants we have : @xmath183\\ne 0\\;\\;\\forall\\ ; k\\in a , \\hspace{2pc } a=\\left\\ { |\\im(k)|<\\sqrt{\\re(k)^2+\\frac{m^2+m^2}{2}}\\ ; \\text{and}\\;\\im(k)\\re(k)\\ne 0\\right\\}\\label{log2}\\ ] ]    because of this condition , if logarithmic branch cuts are present in the strip @xmath168 they must be located along the imaginary axis .",
    "looking at the expression for the effective temperature ( [ new26 ] ) it is evident that the integrand along this axis and within the strip @xmath168 is always real and strictly positive .",
    "since logarithmic branch cuts occur only when the real part of the excitation density @xmath54 is negative , we conclude that there is no logarithmic branch cut in the strip .",
    "in this paper we analysed in detail the locality properties of the gge for interacting - to - free quenches , in the framework of relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "the main results and conclusions are summarised below :    1 .",
    "the gge constructed with only local charges always fails to describe the steady state for such quantum quenches , both on a quantitative and on a qualitative level .",
    "this can be seen on the two - point correlation function and most importantly in its long distance behavior , which is precisely the local observable that quantum field theories are expected to describe .",
    "while the momentum space version of the gge is always correct , if we insist to express the steady state in terms of charges defined in coordinate space , we necessarily have to use quasilocal charges . despite their nonlocal nature",
    ", their weight in the gge decays exponentially with the distance over a scale of the order of the minimum inverse mass involved .",
    "this means that a gge that describes correctly all local observables in a finite subsystem is only mildly nonlocal : the contribution of quasilocal charges outside the subsystem is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the pathological behaviour of the local gge naturally appears in continuous models .",
    "in fact the problem originates in a naive application of the continuum limit , as already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "a consistent generalisation of the lattice version of the local charges in the continuum limit is the quasilocal charges , instead of the standard local charges of quantum field theory . in other words ,",
    "the continuous limit of an infinite series of local charges in the lattice ( as the gge free energy ) does not converge to an infinite series of local charges in the continuum , since the order of limits is important .",
    "4 .   our arguments do not rely on the explicit construction of the local gge and in particular the determination of the lagrange multipliers .",
    "even though , as we mentioned , the local charges exhibit uv divergences in typical quench initial states , these can be easily cured by a suitable uv regulator .",
    "this might or might not allow the determination of the lagrange multipliers , which in any case remains a difficult task .",
    "however the observed failure of the local gge is completely independent from these issues : no matter how we determine the lagrange multipliers , the so - constructed gge always suffers from the same problem and does not reproduce correctly the two point correlator , in particular it qualitatively fails at large distances .",
