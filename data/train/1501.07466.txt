    "the association of the still recently - discovered @xmath2 scalar particle @xcite with the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) places the stability of the electroweak vacuum under question  @xcite .",
    "this instability , arising at an energy scale around @xmath3  @xcite , results from the renormalization - group ( rg ) running of the higgs self - coupling , whose value is driven negative by contributions dominated by top - quark loops .",
    "state - of - the - art calculations suggest that the electroweak vacuum is metastable , having a lifetime longer than the present age of the universe and lying at the edge of the stable region  @xcite , where seemingly - small corrections may have a material impact upon predictions .",
    "the uncertainty in such predictions remains , at present , dominated by that of the top - quark pole mass  @xcite .",
    "even so , it has been suggested  @xcite that , regardless of any improved precision in the experimental determination of the latter , the presence of planck - scale operators may weaken the claim of metastability .",
    "nevertheless , having , as yet , no experimental evidence of additional stabilizing physics between the electroweak and planck scales , it is provident to consider approaches to the calculation of tunneling rates that can consistently account for radiative corrections .",
    "the degree of vacuum metastability provides a strong criterion for the phenomenological viability of extensions to the sm .",
    "for example , supersymmetric scenarios can be ruled out if the electroweak symmetry - breaking vacuum decays into a color - breaking one in a timescale shorter than the age of the universe  @xcite .",
    "in addition , transitions between vacua can also occur at finite temperature  @xcite . in the context of early - universe cosmology , this is of interest because the corresponding first - order phase transitions may leave behind relic gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "moreover , such phase transitions may turn out to be pivotal for generating the cosmic matter - antimatter asymmetry  @xcite . as a consequence of these applications and the wide range of phenomenological models , there are now routine methods for computing transition rates at both vanishing and finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "vacuum transitions in scalar theories can be described in the following way  @xcite . in the event that there are two non - degenerate vacua , an initially homogeneous system lying in the false vacuum will spontaneously nucleate bubbles of true vacuum , leading to the production of domain walls or `` kinks . ''",
    "the latter are the topological solitons that interpolate between regions of true and false vacuum .",
    "the study of these `` solitary wave '' solutions to non - linear equations of motion ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) has a long history  @xcite , and archetypal examples of such field configurations arise in the sine - gordon model  @xcite and the @xmath4 theory with tachyonic mass @xmath5 . the semi - classical  @xcite and quantum  @xcite descriptions of false vacuum decay in the latter theory were presented in the seminal works by coleman and callan ( see also ref .",
    "early expansion on these works included induced vacuum decay  @xcite and the incorporation of gravity  @xcite .    in order to decide whether a vacuum configuration is unstable , i.e.  whether there exists a lowest - lying true vacuum , it is often necessary to account for the impact of radiative corrections .",
    "this is of particular relevance when the appearance or disappearance of minima is entirely a radiative effect  @xcite , such as occurs for the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite or in symmetry restoration at finite temperature  @xcite . in phenomenological studies ,",
    "this is commonly done by calculating the tunneling rate from the effective potential  @xcite of a _ homogeneous _ field configuration  @xcite , which is subsequently promoted to a space - time - dependent configuration .",
    "this practice is problematic for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of the solitonic background is not fully taken into account  @xcite . secondly , in the presence of tachyonic instabilities , e.g.",
    "when there are non - convex regions in the tree - level potential , the perturbatively - calculated effective potential receives a seemingly - pathological imaginary part .",
    "the latter has been shown  @xcite to have a physical interpretation as a decay rate for an initially homogeneous field configuration ( see also ref .",
    "however , this subtlety can be circumvented by using constructions such as the coarse - grained effective action  @xcite or , as is often employed in lattice simulations , the constraint effective potential  @xcite ( cf .",
    "in addition , within the context of the sm , the standard rg improvement of the effective potential has recently been questioned  @xcite . for the above reasons , it is reasonable to conclude that the use of the effective potential to calculate transition rates is neither satisfactory nor justifiable and it is desirable to consider alternative methods for determining quantum corrections , which can be applied to a wide range of models that feature vacuum decay .",
    "the first quantum corrections  @xcite to the tunneling rate are those arising from the functional determinant over the quadratic fluctuations about the classical soliton configuration . in the case",
    "of one - dimensional operators , these determinants may be calculated using the gelfand - yaglom theorem  @xcite , which may be generalized to higher dimensions in the case of radially - symmetric operators  @xcite .",
    "general numerical techniques may then be obtained  @xcite for calculating tunneling rates beyond the so - called thin - wall approximation , in which the width of the bubble wall is much smaller than its radius .",
    "these approaches have also been applied to radially - separable yang - mills backgrounds  @xcite and scenarios in curved spacetime  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "as we will employ , the functional determinant may be calculated by means of the so - called heat kernel method ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , based upon the schwinger proper - time representation and zeta function regularization  @xcite .",
    "previously , this approach has been used to derive approximate analytic results for the one - loop fluctuation determinant beyond the thin - wall approximation  @xcite , as well as one - loop corrections to sphaleron rates  @xcite .",
    "the latter have also been calculated by direct integration of the green s function  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that properties of topological solitons may be studied non - perturbatively using monte carlo and lattice simulations by considering correlation functions directly  @xcite .",
    "other authors have proposed methods for calculating quantum corrections based upon functional renormalization techniques  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we derive an _",
    "result for the green s function of the @xmath6 theory in the background of the classical kink solution . within the thin- and planar - wall approximations ,",
    "we illustrate that this green s function may be used to determine _ analytically _ the leading quantum corrections to both the semi - classical bounce action and the kink solution itself , thereby allowing us to compute the tunneling rate at the two - loop level , while isolating its diagrammatic interpretation .",
    "the latter calculation is performed within the context of a toy model extended with an additional @xmath1 heavier scalars , where the parametric dependence on @xmath1 allows the identification of a concrete example in which the calculated two - loop corrections dominate over the neglected higher - loop corrections .",
    "we illustrate that the problem of calculating these radiative corrections may be reduced to one of solving one - dimensional ordinary differential equations and integrals .",
    "thus , we anticipate that this methodical development may have numerical applications in the study of the decay rates of radiatively - generated metastable vacua , such as occur in the massless cw model  @xcite or the higgs potential of the sm .",
    "similar methods based upon green s function techniques have been used previously to determine self - consistent bounce solutions _ numerically _ in the hartree approximation of the pure @xmath0 theory in both two and four dimensions  @xcite .",
