    "the generalizations@xcite of the degree of polarization and coherence matrix may be appreciated .",
    "the theory of polarization optics was developed in the aforetime centuries : poincare s sphere,@xcite stokes parameters , @xcite wolf s coherence matrix,@xcite @xmath0 jones matrix , @xcite @xmath1 mueller matrix , @xcite etc .",
    "the coherence matrix serves for the description of a partially polarized beam , when it propagates in a certain direction . in refs .",
    "@xcite the coherence matrix was generalized to the so called _ light beam tensor _ , which keeps invariant with respect to the rotations in the three - dimensional space .",
    "the coherence matrix is the special representation of this tensorial quantity .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the light beam tensor for the three - dimensional electromagnetic beams . in the previous studies ,",
    "the three - dimensional coherence matrix , 9 stokes parameters , and three - dimensional degree of polarization were introduced.@xcite however , the proposed degree of polarization is just the mathematical generalization of the two - dimensional coherence matrix .",
    "physically justified 3d degree of polarization @xcite as the ratio of the intensity of the fully polarized field to the total intensity turns out to be different quantity .    in section",
    "ii of the paper we discuss the definition of the unpolarized field and find out that the 3d coherence matrix is not able to describe the general beam structure . in section iii",
    "we derive that the mathematically generalized degree of polarization @xcite coincides with physically defined one @xcite when the beam consists of completely polarized and completely unpolarized components @xcite . in this case",
    "we study the light beam tensor in details .",
    "this beam tensor involves only 6 independent parameters , therefore , requires 6 stokes parameters . in section iv ,",
    "the choice of the 6 stokes parameters is discussed .",
    "the problem of the reconstruction of the three - dimensional light beam s tensor using the in - plane measurements is considered in section v. section vi concludes the paper .",
    "when one characterizes 2d partially polarized light , it is intuitively clear that the polarized light is the coherent superposition of partial waves , while unpolarized light is non - coherent superposition of partial waves which polarizations are equiprobable . for the 3d light",
    "one naturally keeps the definition of polarized wave @xcite .",
    "unpolarized light is not well defined and treated as something complicated . in this section",

    "is it really clear that the partially polarized beam consists of completely polarized beam and completely unpolarized beam and , therefore , can be described by the 2d coherence matrix ?",

    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "then the incident naturally polarized beam becomes unpolarized light which polarizations are equiprobable in this angle sector .",
    "when several such beams are mixed ( fig . [ fig1](b ) ) , the 2d state of polarization can not be fully described by the regular coherence matrix .",
    "should we say that the coherence matrix of the 2d field is limited ?",
    "we think it is just needed to consider usual definition of the unpolarized light as superposition of equiprobable polarizations .",
    "the similar story is usually narrated for 3d electromagnetic fields .",
    "it is accepted that a 3d partially polarized field can be presented as superposition of completely polarized light , completely unpolarized light ( mix of equiprobably polarized waves ) , and something else which is related to unpolarized light ( 2d unpolarized light according to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in general , electric field of the 3d unpolarized light can be treated as the sum of electric fields of different unpolarized electromagnetic beams , such as in - plane completely unpolarized , completely unpolarized waves with wavevectors lying on the cone ( bessel beams ) , etc .",
    "some examples are demonstrated in fig .",
    "it is evident that if the 3d unpolarized field is formed by many such partial beams , we need much more than 9 parameters which are introduced to describe the @xmath2 coherence matrix . thus we fundamentally can not retrieve the realistic structure of the 3d field , if we know nothing of the field .",

    "quantity @xmath14 defined by eq .",

    "if @xmath40 , we can not reconstruct the structure of the beam using 9 parameters of the general 3d coherence matrix eq .",
    "( [ spectralphi ] ) . nevertheless , the beam parameters can be found , if we make more measurements than 9 . but this can be done only if we know the form of the coherence matrix , e.g. eq . ( [ bt_example1 ] ) .",
    "if the directions of propagation of the 2d unpolarized beams are unknown , it is necessary to introduce two additional parameters for each real unit vector @xmath32 , i.e. the number of unknown parameters is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath42 , the coherence matrix indeed can be presented as the sum of coherent part , completely 3d unpolarized part , and completely 2d unpolarized part , respectively : @xmath43 if the directions of propagation of 2d unpolarized beams are known , it is feasible to specify 3d field using the coherence matrix eq .",
    "( [ bt_example1 ] ) for @xmath44 .    concluding this section , it is not possible to determine the actual structure of either 3d or 2d field , if we know nothing about the field itself , because the coherence matrix does not carry sufficient information .",
    "in 2d case , it is accepted that the fully unpolarized light possesses equiprobable in - plane polarizations .",
    "we are convinced that the similar definition of the completely unpolarized light should be used for the 3d light .",
    "if the beam is arbitrary , it is not sufficient to set even 9 components of the coherence matrix ( [ spectralphi ] ) to _ unambiguously _ determine the structure of the beam .",
    "according to the results of the previous section we consider the 3d field as composed of completely 3d polarized light and completely 3d unpolarized light .",
    "this means that there are no specific directions and two forms of light beam tensor @xmath45 and @xmath46 should be equivalent .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath47 and the beam tensor of the three - dimensional light equals @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 describe completely polarized and unpolarized light , respectively .",

    "completely unpolarized light is characterized by @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "it should be noted that the generalized degree of polarization obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite coincides with eq .",
    "( [ dopinvar ] ) .",

    "( [ phifinal ] ) . when the coherence matrix is the general @xmath2 hermitian matrix , the degree of polarization is expressed as @xmath76 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the three eigenvalues can be found using three invariants of the coherence matrix @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , and closed - form expression for @xmath80 is expected to be more complicated . for the derived beam tensor ( [ phifinal ] ) the generalized and physically justified degrees of polarization",
    "are agreed as it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite      transition from the three - dimensional light to the two - dimensional one can be performed by excluding one eigenvector ( assuming , e.g. , @xmath81 ) . in the previously derived formulae we have considered vector @xmath82 normalized by unity , what should be violated in the 2d case .",
    "so , we will explicitly write the vector @xmath82 in equations",
    ". then @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and @xmath85    in terms of the invariants of the coherence matrix , the degree of polarization of the beam takes the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 ) and ( [ dopinvar1 ] ) are valid both for three - dimensional and two - dimensional fields . for 3d and 2d",
    "fields one needs to apply @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "three - dimensional beam s tensor ( [ 3d_bt ] ) is the sum of the dyads @xmath90 .",
    "when we want to study the light on a plane , we need to consider projected fields @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the projector onto the plane with normal vector @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the beam tensor composed of such projected electric fields equals @xmath95 when the elementary waves of the beam propagate in the same direction @xmath56 , we obtain the ordinary two - dimensional coherence matrix @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the electric field vector in the plane of constant phase .",
    "it should be noted that in general we can write the beam tensor projection on _ any _ plane according to eq .",
    "( [ phi2im ] ) .",
    "if @xmath28 was the general matrix ( [ spectralphi ] ) , it would contain 9 independent parameters , which could be written as stokes parameters for the three - dimensional fields .",
    "however , the coherence matrix has reduced form ( [ phifinal ] ) , which decreases the number of independent parameters .",
    "let us calculate the number of independent parameters of beam s tensor ( [ phifinal ] ) .",
    "normalized complex vector @xmath54 can be expressed in terms of 4 real quantities , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , as @xmath102 ( coefficient in front of @xmath103 can be regarded as real , because @xmath54 enters beam s tensor as @xmath104 . ) adding two more real eigenvalues @xmath105 and @xmath106 , we claim 6 independent parameters for the light beam tensor .",
    "definition of the three - dimensional beam tensor in the form ( [ phifinal ] ) does not take into account the transversality condition @xmath107 .",
    "completely polarized electric field @xmath108 can be found from the definition @xmath109 .",
    "then the electric field equals @xmath110 , while the transversality condition reads @xmath111 in general , the phase @xmath112 distribution can not be supposed and eq .",
    "( [ transverse ] ) is the differential equation for the phase @xmath113 : @xmath114 the number of independent parameters for @xmath28 is still 6 .",
    "when we know the phase , e.g. , @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is the propagation constant of the beam ) , the transversality condition @xmath117 becomes the pair of restrictions on @xmath118 and @xmath54 of the form @xmath119 and @xmath120 , so that the beam is fully described by the 4 independent parameters ( stokes parameters ) .",
    "when the beam consists of the plane waves propagating in the direction of vector @xmath56 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 is constant .",
    "( [ transverse1 ] ) reads @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "this is equivalent to the conditions @xmath125 on the coherence matrix used in the definition ( [ 2d_bt ] ) .",
    "thus , if there are no preferred directions , the transversality condition just exhibits the differential equation for the phase @xmath113 and does not decrease the number of the independent parameters @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . if the phase @xmath113 is somehow defined , there are two additional equations for the parameters , and we can use only @xmath98 , @xmath100 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "so , we should have 6 stokes parameters for truly three - dimensional fields and 4 stokes parameters for 2d fields , when we can introduce the preferred direction ( say , the direction of the beam propagation ) .    the stokes parameters can be introduced as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite but then we need to choose only 6 parameters of 9 , which are independent .",
    "the rest 3 parameters can be expressed using the independent 6 parameters .",
    "one of such links between the stokes parameters is shown below : @xmath126 ^ 2 = 4 \\frac{\\lambda_4 ^ 2 + \\lambda_5 ^ 2}{\\lambda_6 ^ 2 + \\lambda_7 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) are the stokes parameters introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the three - dimensional fields .",
    "two more links can be derived .",
    "however , since most of the stokes parameters @xmath127 have no physical sense and can be found from the coherence matrix , we propose another set of the stokes parameters .",
    "for example , it is more convenient to use 4 conventional stokes parameters in some plane ( e.g. , in ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) plane ) and two more parameters in another plane ( e.g. , in ( @xmath129 , @xmath131 ) plane ) : @xmath132 then @xmath133 is proportional to the field intensity in the plane of detector and @xmath134 is proportional to the spin angular momentum in the @xmath131-direction .",
    "from the point of view of physics the field intensities and spin angular momenta are beneficial as independent parameters .",
    "therefore , we also propose the _ physical stokes parameters _ for the three - dimensional beams : @xmath135 parameters @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 stand for the intensities in the planes ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) , ( @xmath129 , @xmath131 ) , and ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) , respectively , while @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 describe the spin angular momenta in directions @xmath131 , @xmath130 , and @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath136 and @xmath139 coincide with analogous quantities of the usual set of stokes parameters @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) . with the eigenvalues @xmath118 and 4 parameters of the vector @xmath54",
    "( [ u1 ] ) ) , the physical stokes parameters take the form @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the two - dimensional stokes parameters require @xmath147 or @xmath148 . in this case",
    "we have only 4 independent parameters @xmath118 , @xmath98 , and @xmath100 , and the physical stokes parameters @xmath149 are reduced to the four quantities , which can be connected with the ordinary stokes parameters as @xmath150",
    "measurement of nine components of the coherence matrix for 3d fields were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we deal with the measurement of the components of the coherence matrix eq .",
    "( [ phifinal ] ) using the measurement of the fields in the detector plane .",
    "let us denote the normal vector to the detector plane as @xmath93 and reveal how the position of this plane influences the beam s tensor and degree of polarization .",
    "we will determine characteristics of the 2d beam tensor as projection of the 3d beam tensor .",
    "the absolute value of the three - dimensional vector @xmath54 projected on a plane is less than unity and we lose the information about vector component orthogonal to the detector @xmath151 .",
    "then projected beam s tensor @xmath152 can be rewritten in the form @xmath153 where @xmath154 is situated in the plane with the normal vector @xmath93 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 is the projection operator .",
    "the detector - measured intensities of the completely polarized and unpolarized parts of the beam are @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "degree of polarization is defined as the part of the intensity of completely polarized beam divided by the total intensity : @xmath159 @xmath118 are defined by eq .",
    "( [ labmda12 ] ) via invariants of the 3d coherence matrix . in terms of invariants of @xmath160",
    "we will get to the usual formula for the degree of polarization at the plane : @xmath161 .",
    "we aim to retrieve the 3d beam s tensor using detectors ( measurements in plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . at first",
    "one can measure the ordinary 2d coherence matrix in some plane ( name it ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) plane ) @xmath162    as a result , we determine @xmath163 by means of the known matrix @xmath164 . from these equations we unambiguously find @xmath165 and direction of the vector @xmath166 .",
    "complete retrieval of the 3d coherence matrix requires knowing the vector in 3d space , i.e. measurements out of the plane ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) .",
    "if we put a detector in the plane ( @xmath129 , @xmath131 ) , using the coherence matrix @xmath167 we can write another projection of the vector @xmath54 @xmath168 then the vector under search is @xmath169 or in the explicit form @xmath170 @xmath106 has been found from the in - plane measurement , while @xmath105 ( and the final form of @xmath54 ) follows from the normalization condition @xmath171 as @xmath172 thus we reconstruct the three - dimensional beam tensor ( coherence matrix ) described by eq .",

    "the degree of polarization for the three - dimensional light follows from eq .",
    "( [ dopinvar ] ) .",
    "we have derived the light beam tensor ( coherence matrix ) for three - dimensional fields grounding on the expected symmetry properties : beam s tensor should not change for rotations with respect to the direction of the fully polarized light .",
    "such a restricted form of the coherence matrix is justified by the definition of the fully polarized light as sum of equiprobably polarized elementary waves .",
    "general form of coherence matrix deals with the limited number of unpolarized beams and does not allow determining the actual structure of the field in principle .",
    "that is why it is not a great simplification to treat partially polarized light as superposition of coherent field and 3d random field .",
    "all the more so considered beam tensor ( [ phifinal ] ) has clear meaning and can be described by 6 independent parameters  stokes parameters .",
    "for the three dimensional light it is natural to choose 6 physical parameters : 3 intensities in different planes and 3 spin angular momenta .",
    "we call these values `` physical stokes parameters . ''",
    "finally , we have developed the procedure of reconstruction of the 3d light beam tensor using the measurements of the 2d coherence matrices of projected fields .    in some situations",
    "it may be not really necessary to introduce the 3d coherence matrix at all .",
    "indeed , if we define the plane of detector as distinguished interface ( like the plane of constant phase in 2d case ) , then we can calibrate the degree of polarization for the 3d beams with respect to this interface .",
    "some different beams may have the same degree of polarizations , though the beams should be different . only if it is crucial for the results , the full reconstruction of the 3d coherence matrix and calculation of the 3d degree of polarization is needed ."
