    "the most commonly studied mott problem @xcite involves the single band hubbard model on a bipartite lattice @xcite . in such a model , typically , nesting features drive a transition @xcite to an antiferromagnetic insulating state at arbitrarily weak interaction - masking the ` mott ' effect .",
    "one can certainly study frustrated lattices @xcite , which suppress magnetic order , and there is much work @xcite on the triangular lattice hubbard model .",
    "this is both an important model problem @xcite and also a starting point for the layered organics @xcite .",
    "other frustrated lattices include the kagome @xcite in two dimensions ( 2d ) and the fcc and pyrochlore lattices @xcite in 3d .",
    "these are all harder problems than the square ( or cubic ) lattice since there is no longer any obvious magnetic order to simplify the correlated problem .",
    "these lattices , overall , provide interesting variation from the bipartite case because ( i )  the metal - insulator transition could occur in the background of short - range magnetic correlation , and ( ii )  the deep mott insulating state itself could be a spin liquid @xcite",
    ".    it would be vital to have experimental realisations to test out the predictions of the frustrated mott studies . while there is significant effort in analysing the quasi 2d @xmath0-bedt organics @xcite in terms of the triangular lattice , 3d realisations of ` hubbard physics ' on a frustrated structure are rare .",
    "materials like the manganites @xcite do involve strong correlation effects ( and much else ) but are on a bipartite structure - with relatively simple magnetic order .",
    "in this situation the discovery of the rare - earth ( r ) based pyrochlores , the molybdates @xcite , r@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , and the iridates @xcite , r@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , provided a breakthrough .",
    "both these families show a metal - insulator transition as the rare - earth radius @xmath3 is reduced @xcite .",
    "there are , however , key differences ( i )  in terms of degrees of freedom and couplings , with respect to the hubbard model , and ( ii )  the magnetic state that emerges in these two families .",
    "being 4d and 5d systems , respectively , both molybdates and iridates involve multiple bands . in the molybdate case",
    "this can be reduced to one itinerant electron in two degenerate orbitals .",
    "these electrons have an inter - orbital hubbard repulsion and are also hund s coupled to a @xmath4 local moment at each mo site @xcite . for the iridates one can motivate the use of an effective single band model which involve strong spin - orbit coupling in addition to the hubbard interaction @xcite . while both families show a ` mott ' transition , for the molybdates this happens in a somewhat spin disordered background , with no long range order in the insulating state @xcite , while the iridates generally show a transition from a paramagnetic metal to an ` all - in - all - out ' magnetic insulator @xcite .",
    "the frustration in the pyrochlore lattice plays a role in both these materials , but one clearly requires more than the simple hubbard model to approach the phenomena .    this paper is focused on a detailed study of the model appropriate to the molybdates r@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "these exhibit ground states vary from a ferromagnetic metal ( fm - m ) to a spin glass metal ( sg - m ) and then a spin glass insulator ( sg - i ) as the rare earth radius is reduced @xcite . materials with r = nd and sm are metallic , r = tb , dy , ho , er , and y are insulating , and r = gd is on the verge of the insulator - metal transition @xcite ( imt ) . the highest ferromagnetic @xmath5 is @xmath6k , in nd , while the spin glass transition temperature , @xmath7 is typically @xcite @xmath8k .",
    "the unusual features in transport include very large residual resistivity , @xmath9 10 @xmath10 cm close to the metal - insulator transition @xcite , prominent anomalous hall effect in metallic samples @xcite , _ e.g _ , nd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , and magnetic field driven metallisation in the weakly insulating samples @xcite _ e.g _ , gd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "we will discuss the model for the molybdates in detail later , to motivate our study it suffices to mention that the active degrees of freedom include one electron per mo in a twofold degenerate orbital , hund s coupled to a @xmath4 moment on the same ion .",
    "the electrons have onsite hubbard repulsion @xmath11 between them while the local moments have a nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath12 .",
    "the hund s coupling drives double exchange ( de ) ferromagnetism , opposed by af superexchange , while hubbard repulsion promotes a mott insulating state .",
    "reducing @xmath3 reduces the hopping - weakening de and also enhancing the effect of hubbard repulsion , while increasing pressure is supposed to ( mainly ) affect @xcite the antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "there are several major questions left unresolved by existing work : ( 1 )  at ambient pressure the metal - insulator and magnetic ` transition ' are simultaneous , is that true with increasing pressure ( changing @xmath12 ) as well ?",
    "( 2 )  is there an ` universal ' quantity that dictates the mit trajectory over a large pressure window ? ( 3 )",
    "what is the fate of the coupled spin - orbital state for changing pressure and rare earth radius ?",
    "( 4 )  what is the low energy spectral behaviour in the vicinity of the mit as the pressure is varied ? ( 5 )  what is the quasiparticle character close to the mott transition ? ( 6 )  can we obtain realistic thermal scales for the magnetic transitions ?",
    "we employ a real space approach , equivalent to unrestricted hartree - fock at zero temperature , that uses a static auxiliary orbital field to handle the hubbard interaction .",
    "we solve the resulting ` electron  -  local moment  -  orbital moment ' problem via monte carlo based simulated annealing on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "within the limits of our method we address ( 1)-(4 ) of the questions posed above , and ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) elsewhere .",
    "our main results are the following :    ( i )  _ phase boundaries : _ the proximity of the magnetic transition and mit in the ambient pressure molybdates is a coincidence - at weak af coupling the metal and insulator are both ferromagnetic , while at strong af coupling they are both spin disordered .",
    "( ii )  _ physics behind the mit : _ the shift in the critical interaction for the mit , with applied pressure , can be understood in terms of the kinetic energy suppression driven by growing spin and orbital disorder .",
    "( iii )  _ coupled spin - orbital state : _ the magnetic state is a spin ferromagnet ( s - f ) or a spin liquid ( s - l ) , the orbital state is similarly o - f or o - l .",
    "we find that the low @xmath12 state is mainly s - f  -  o - f while the large @xmath12 state is s - l  -o - l .",
    "the exception is the large @xmath13 state at small @xmath12 which is s - f but o - l .",
    "( iv )  _ spectral behaviour near the mit : _ the @xmath14 changes with changing @xmath12 , so we use a normalised frequency scale , @xmath15 , to compare spectral features . at the mit the larger @xmath12 systems have more low energy spectral weight than the weak @xmath12 case .",
    "surprisingly , the gap edge states at large @xmath12 are strongly localised , leading to an optical gap that is larger than the density of states gap , revealing the growing anderson character of the transition with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is one of a two part study of the two orbital magnetic phase competing model appropriate to the molybdates .",
    "this paper , paper  i , focuses on the ground state , paper  ii will discuss thermal phase transitions .",
    "although focused on the ground state , most of the introductory and methodological issues are discussed in this paper , and not repeated in paper  ii . in the next section",
    "we discuss the auxiliary field based monte carlo method , indicating its relation to full fledged quantum monte carlo and the unrestricted hartree - fock methods .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the results , including the ground state phase diagram , the detailed magnetic and orbital structure factors in the different phases , and the density of states and transport properties across the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the r@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 structure consists of two interpenetrating pyrochlore lattices , one formed by mo cations and the other by r. model hamiltonian studies ignore the orbitals on r and oxygen , focusing instead on the orbitals on mo .",
    "the mo atom has octahedral oxygen coordination , the resulting crystal field splits the fivefold degenerate mo 4d states into doubly degenerate @xmath16 and triply degenerate @xmath17 manifolds , and a trigonal distortion splits the @xmath17 further into a nondegenerate @xmath18 and and a doubly degenerate @xmath19 .",
    "the hopping matrix elements between mo orbitals at different sites is dictated by the intervening oxygen .",
    "the mo cation is nominally tetravalent and has two electrons on average .",
    "the deeper @xmath18 state behaves like a local moment , and the single electron in the two @xmath19 orbitals is the ` itinerant ' degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 state remains unoccupied .",
    "there are additional small scales , related to bond distortions , _ etc _ , that are responsible for the spin freezing phenomena @xcite .",
    "we ignore them for the time being .",
    "also , the moments on r can be relevant when studying effects like spin chirality induced anomalous hall effect @xcite .",
    "we do not include these moments in our model .",
    "we study the following model @xcite , in parameter regimes described below : @xmath20 the first term is the kinetic energy , involving nearest neighbour intra and inter - orbital @xmath19 hopping .",
    "the second term is the hund s coupling between the @xmath18 local moment @xmath21 and the @xmath19 electrons , @xmath12 is the af superexchange coupling between local moments at neighbouring sites on the pyrochlore lattice , and the @xmath13 represent onsite @xmath19 coulomb matrix elements .    to simplify the computational problem",
    "we treat the localized spins @xmath21 as classical unit vectors , absorbing the size @xmath22 in the magnetic couplings .",
    "we will comment on the limitations of this approximation later . also , to reduce the size of the hilbert space we assume that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the typical hopping scale , so that only the locally ` spin aligned ' fermion state is retained . in this local basis",
    "the hopping matrix elements are dictated by the orientation of the @xmath21 on neighbouring sites .",
    "this leads to the simpler model : @xmath25 where the fermions are now ` spinless ' .",
    "@xmath26 is the inter - orbital hubbard repulsion .",
    "the effective hopping is determined by the orientation of the localized spins @xmath27 , as @xmath28 t^{\\alpha\\beta } $ ] , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we set @xmath31 as is appropriate for these kinds of orbitals @xcite .",
    "the first two terms represent fermions in a classical spin background and the resulting magnetic phase competition has been studied on a pyrochlore @xcite .",
    "while these results are interesting they miss out on the large correlation scale , @xmath13 , that drives the mott transition .",
    "one option is to treat the model within dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , but then the spatial character crucial to the pyrochlore lattice is lost .",
    "the current paper is focused on the ground state but we discuss our general strategy for solving the finite temperature problem below .",
    "this will set the stage for the finite @xmath32 results in paper  ii , and also describe the simulated annealing scheme for arriving at the ground state .",
    "we handle the problem in real space as follows :",
    "( i )  we use a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) @xcite transformation that decouples @xmath33 in terms of an auxiliary orbital variable @xmath34 , coupling to the electronic orbital moment @xmath35 , and a scalar field @xmath36 coupling to the electronic density @xmath37 at each site .",
    "the matsubara frequency versions of these fields are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a bosonic frequency .",
    "( ii )  an exact treatment of the resulting functional integral , see below , requires quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) - computing a fermion determinant @xmath41 iteratively as the ` weight factor ' for auxiliary field configurations .",
    "fermion green s functions would be computed on the equilibrium @xmath42 backgrounds .",
    "the qmc implementation , which we will approximate , takes the following route .",
    "the partition function is written as a functional integral over grassmann fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath45    the quartic term is ` decoupled ' exactly via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath34 are two auxiliary fields : @xmath47 coupling to charge density @xmath48 , and @xmath34 coupling to the orbital variable @xmath49 .",
    "this leads to : @xmath50 since the fermions are now quadratic the @xmath51 integrals can be formally performed to generate the effective action for the background fields : @xmath52 + \\int_0^\\beta d \\tau { \\cal l}_{cl}(\\tau )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the expression above @xmath53 is the electron green s function in a @xmath54 background .",
    "now the options .",
    "( 1 )  quantum monte carlo would proceed by using @xmath55 as the ` weight ' for the background configurations , and compute electron properties on these after equilibriation .",
    "( 2 )  mean field theory would assume the fields to be time independent , replace them by their mean values , and minimise the free energy .",
    "( 3 )  a _ static path approximation _ to @xmath56 again assumes the fields to be time independent , but samples over spatial fluctuations .",
    "we adopt method ( 3 ) , which is computationally simpler than qmc but much more sophisticated than mft at finite temperature .",
    "so we ( i )  neglect the imaginary time dependence of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , _ i.e _",
    ", retain only the zero matsubara frequency modes of these fields , and ( ii )  replace @xmath57 by its saddle point value @xmath59 , since the important low energy fluctuations arise from the @xmath60 .",
    "the electron is now subject to _",
    "static _ background fields so the partition function can be written as a trace over an effective ` hamiltonian ' , rather than require an effective ` action ' . specifically : @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 the heisenberg term .",
    "for convenience we redefine @xmath64 , so that the @xmath60 is dimensionless .",
    "this leads to the effective electronic hamiltonian used in the text : @xmath65 the localized spin and orbital moment configurations follow the distribution @xmath66 this overall approach has been used in the nuclear many body problem @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , _ etc _ , and by us in other studies of the mott problem before @xcite .",
    "there are regimes where some analytic progress can be made , as we discuss later , but our results are based on a monte carlo solution of the model above - generating the equilibrium configuration for the @xmath67 through iterative diagonalisation of @xmath68 .",
    "we start with high temperature , @xmath69 , higher than any transition temperature in the problem , and reduce it to @xmath70 to access ground state properties . to access large sizes within reasonable time we use a cluster algorithm @xcite for estimating the update cost .",
    "results in this paper are for a @xmath71 pyrochlore lattice of @xmath72 atoms .    a couple of comments on the @xmath73 limit of our method which reduces to unrestricted hartree - fock in the magnetic channel .",
    "traditionally , hartree - fock calculations impose a certain pattern on the order parameter and minimise with respect to the amplitude . on a frustrated geometry",
    "it is not clear what pattern to impose so we vary with respect to the full set @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting state turns out to be disordered but correlated , and leads to a non trivial electronic spectrum .      from the equilibrium configurations obtained at the end of annealing we calculate the following averaged quantities (",
    "angular brackets represent thermal average over mc configurations ) : ( i )  magnetic and orbital structure factors are : @xmath75 ( ii )  the size distribution of the orbital field is computed as @xmath76 ( iii )  the electronic density of states is , @xmath77 where @xmath78 are single particle eigenvalues in an equilibrium configuration .",
