    "in the recent years an increasing interest has been devoted to the accurate estimation of electron screening effects both for the solar plasma fusion rates and low energy earth experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    as a rule ,",
    "one considers electrostatic screening in the solar plasma .",
    "this approach being classical or quantum correctly reflects the major properties of a process only for high relative velocity of the colliding nuclei , when electron density is supposed to be unchanged during the collision .",
    "in the case , when relative velocity of the nuclei is too small in comparison with the electron one , the electron density is changed accordingly to any relative configuration of the nuclei .",
    "thus the electrons have an impact on a kinetic energy shift of the nuclei .",
    "such a process is considered in the adiabatic approach , which comes from the well known born - oppenheimer method .",
    "an accurate treatment in the adiabatic approach of electrons from the continuum spectrum requires an additional research , while screening effects by bound electrons could be easily considered in the framework of the adiabatic approach ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for not very dense stars like the sun",
    ", the commonly accepted debye - hckel approximation on the calculation of screening effect is not quite adequate .",
    "recently this question was discussed by a.  dar and g.  shaviv @xcite .",
    "this fact is usually of no importance considering that the screening due to the plasma electrons is by itself rather small ( see ref .",
    "on the other hand , the low - lying bound electrons on a nucleus do screen the electric charge of the colliding nuclei much effectively .",
    "not only the stellar plasma but earth experiments have such a feature .",
    "indeed , laboratory experiments are performed with atomic or molecular targets , and the ionic beam interacts with the target nuclei while the nuclei are surrounded by a number of bound electrons .",
    "it leads to that the fusion cross section is increased . at low and moderate energies , the fusion cross section of `` bare '' charged nuclei colliding with the relative momenta @xmath1 and reduced mass @xmath2 ( in electron mass unit ) is expressed as ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the so - called astrophysical factor which incorporates all nuclear aspects of the process , @xmath5 is the collision energy of nuclei and @xmath6 ( the latter factor comes from @xmath7- the coulomb wave function of the internuclear motion at the origin ) and @xmath8 is the hydrogen bohr radius .",
    "the screened cross section differs by a factor @xmath9 defined as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are fusion cross sections both of the screened and `` bare '' nuclei , and @xmath13 is the wave function of the internuclear motion at the origin , taking into account the bound electron around .",
    "in this letter we present the first quantum mechanical calculation of screening effect by bound electron in @xmath14 nuclear fusion .",
    "this reaction is of no importance for the sun luminosity but it is of great interest in solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "an analysis of solar neutrino experiment data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows that there is no room for @xmath15 neutrinos . at the same time",
    "@xmath16 neutrinos are presented . since @xmath16 nuclei result from the reaction : @xmath17 it looks impossible to explain the existence of @xmath16 neutrinos and the absence of @xmath15 neutrinos in the frame of the standard solar model .    as one of the main consequences of electron screening effect applied to all solar fusions",
    "could be decrease in the sun core temperature . increased values of fusion cross sections could lead to the sun cooling with the same observable solar luminosity .",
    "however , just cool sun models do not solve the solar neutrino problem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we show that bound electron essentially enhances the fusion rate in comparison with the reaction ( [ creation ] ) rate .",
    "physics of this phenomena could be easily understood in the framework of united nucleus approach ( see below ) .",
    "`` exact '' solution of our problem is obtained in adiabatic approach for three particle problem .",
    "we compare our solution with the two relevant approaches ( united nucleus and static approaches , described below ) which give upper and lower estimate for the screening effect , in the considered here three - particle picture .",
    "a finite @xmath18 interaction radius also is of great importance . a larger radius results in higher tunneling probability into the internal region and thus to a higher @xmath19 cross section .",
    "theoretical model ref .",
    "@xcite also predicts increased astrophysical @xmath20-factor .",
    "all above mentioned effects result in the increased @xmath21 production rate and the latter could be a really alternative to @xmath22 reaction .",
    "we treat the coulomb problem for three particles in the framework of the adiabatic representation .",
    "the basic two - center eigenfunctions are derived from the schrdinger equation for two nuclei with electric charges @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( in electron charge unit ) ( @xmath25 ) fixed on a distance @xmath26 and for an electron around them . the schrdinger equation is transformed into a infinite system of equations with separated variables .",
    "our approximation consists in that we use only one two - center eigenfunction corresponding to the ground state of the system .",
    "there are some arguments for this approach .    at first , the high energy states corrections ( at fixed @xmath26 ) are of order of magnitude about the ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass .    then , excited energy levels correspond to the less energy of the united nucleus .",
    "it leads to their exponentially small contribution into the nuclear fusion rate in comparison with the ground state of the system .    at least , only the ground state energy of the electron in the field of @xmath27 and @xmath1 nuclei , called @xmath28 therm ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) has the correct asymptotic behaviour ( see below ) .",
    "the three particle wave function is presented as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the wave function of two colliding nuclei and @xmath31 is the electron wave function , which depends on the internuclear distance @xmath32 .",
    "the electron energy eigenvalue @xmath33 also depends on the internuclear distance .",
    "we use the tabulated values of @xmath34 from ref .",
    "@xcite for our purposes .    in fig .",
    "[ beterm ] the values for the ground state are plotted . at @xmath35",
    "the electron energy approaches to the energy of the united ion : @xmath36 ( energy unit here is 27.21 ev ) and for @xmath37 the electron energy approaches to the energy of the isolated ion @xmath38 : @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the adiabatic approach the electron energy @xmath33 in the field of two nuclei serves as an effective attraction potential for the nuclei .",
    "evidently the main effect of the electron screening comes from the collisions with zero orbital moment of nuclei .",
    "the latter and the correct behaviour of @xmath33 ( at @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) for the ground state allow us to consider the case @xmath44 .",
    "let us denote @xmath45 as @xmath46 . with the electron energy @xmath46 in hand one can solve the scattering problem for two nuclei @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "the total effective potential reads : @xmath47 we calculate values of the wave function of relative motion of the two nuclei at kinetic energies @xmath48 kev @xmath49 kev and compare the calculated @xmath50 with @xmath51 - value of the scattering wave function of two particles in the origin .    for simple estimations one can use well known united nucleus approach that consists in following .",
    "consider a fusion of two nuclei from initial states with bound electrons .",
    "let the total negative energy of these bound electrons be @xmath52 . in the final state",
    "there is an united nucleus with bounded electrons around and let the total energy of the electrons in this new ion be @xmath53 .",
    "thus the difference @xmath54 adds to the kinetic energy of the two nuclei accelerating them .",
    "so , the united nucleus approach changes @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "this is a rather good approach since the main contribution to the value @xmath55 comes from internuclear distances less then classical return point in the potential .    since united nucleus approach replaces decreasing @xmath57 ( see in fig .",
    "[ beterm ] ) by the constant @xmath58 this approach serves as an upper estimate .",
    "another approach uses static wave function of the bound electron .",
    "it means that this wave function does not depend on the internuclear distance .",
    "total three particle wave function is presented as a product : @xmath59 where the wave function for the electron bounded on the nucleus with electric charge @xmath23 reads : @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the wave function of two nuclei . averaging the electron coordinates , @xmath61 can be derived from the schrdinger equation with the potential : @xmath62 kinetic energy of the colliding nuclei is counted from the electron eigenvalue energy in the field of @xmath23 nucleus .",
    "this approach works well for nuclei with relative velocity @xmath63 much greater then electron velocity @xmath64 : @xmath65 .",
    "attractive part of the potential @xmath66 approaches to the value : @xmath67 ( in 27.21 ev unit ) at @xmath68 . since @xmath69-the value of the electron energy in united ion , the static approach gives a lower estimate for an enhancement factor .",
    "we use all three approximations in order to compare their validity .",
    "the numerical solution of the scattering problem of the two nuclei in the potential ( [ poten ] ) was obtained on the mesh on @xmath26 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 in numerov s scheme .",
    "we varied step @xmath72 and @xmath73 in order to ensure that final result is not changed substantially . also for checking purposes we reproduced the value of @xmath74 substituting @xmath75 .      at kinetic energies above @xmath76",
    "kev a very good agreement between all three approaches is obtained , though at lower energies the united nucleus approach overestimates and the static approach underestimates an electron screening effect .",
    "it is easy to see that simple united nucleus prescription gives much closer values for electron screening effect then the static approach .",
    "thus the united nucleus approach being compared with `` exact '' numerical solution could be easily used in stellar evolution code .",
    "as one can see , electron screening could essentially increase nuclear fusion rate and must be taken into account both for earth experiments at low energies and for an understanding of stellar phenomena .",
    "deficit of @xmath15 neutrinos in comparison with @xmath16 neutrinos ( called `` second solar neutrino problem '' , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) could be a good example of this effect . at the same solar model input data the flux of @xmath16 neutrinos increases due to the increased rate of @xmath16 nuclei production and the flux of @xmath15 neutrinos decreases due to the alternative reaction ( [ creation ] ) . at mean kinetic energy in the sun core at temperature @xmath77 ( @xmath78k )",
    "this effect is @xmath79 times of magnitude .",
    "however due to the gamov s `` window '' around @xmath80 kev the screening effect of the bound electron is reduced to @xmath81 .",
    "but if some nuclear fusion reaction go faster in the sun core ( due to the electron screening ) then the temperature in the sun core could be lower . under this assumption",
    "it might be possible to explain the solar neutrino problem .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have performed quantum mechanical calculation of the screening effect taking place in @xmath0 reaction at finite kinetic energy of the nuclei .",
    "we compared our results with two approaches giving upper and lower limits for the screening effect and studied the validity of the approaches .",
    "possible application to the solar neutrinos is briefly discussed ."
