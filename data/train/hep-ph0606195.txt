    "in a recent series of papers@xcite detailed montecarlo studies have been produced for drell - yan @xmath1 experiments at moderate center of mass energies and dilepton masses ( @xmath2 @xmath3 30 - 400 gev@xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 12 gev / c@xmath4 ) .",
    "these experiments would measure unpolarized , single and double spin asymmetries and include proposals and plans at gsi@xcite , at rhic@xcite , and at compass@xcite .    for the following discussion the relevant variables are the squared center of mass energy @xmath2 , the parton longitudinal fractions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the dilepton mass @xmath5 , and @xmath0 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "at magnitude level    @xmath13    for the cases considered here @xmath14 can be 1 nbarn or smaller .",
    "the product @xmath15 is a symbolic way to represent a bilinear combination of partonic distribution functions , that decreases fastly towards zero for @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath0 @xmath16 0.1 .    according to the above equation we have small overall event rates , fastly decreasing at increasing @xmath0 ; however , all transverse spin related measurements require one or both of the longitudinal momentum fractions in the valence region , corresponding to average @xmath0 values that can not be too small .    in a recent publication@xcite the cross sections for drell - yan @xmath1 production in",
    "the kinematical ranges relevant for the quoted experiments has been reconsidered , with resummation of soft gluon emissions near the partonic threshold @xmath0 @xmath11 1 , rising the cross sections in a @xmath17dependent way .",
    "the effect is predicted to be huge for @xmath0 @xmath3 1 , but present anyway , and sometimes strong , also for @xmath0 @xmath18 1 .",
    "if compared to the numbers by @xcite , the enhancement factors can range from 2 to over 10 in regions that are relevant for the quoted experimental proposals at @xmath2 @xmath6 300 gev@xmath4 ( for @xmath2 @xmath11 300 - 500 gev@xmath4 the cross sections are fixed by experimental data , see e.g.@xcite ) .    if the predictions of ref.@xcite are respected , several plans for quantities to be measured at gsi could be reconsidered .",
    "this makes an experimental confirmation of the prediction , if possible , an urgent matter .",
    "apart for competing predictions , it would be useful to establish the @xmath0-dependence of the cross sections as precisely as possible .    in our opinion",
    "this confirmation is possible within a few years with the compass hadronic beam facility@xcite , using a pion beam at 50 gev / c .",
    "the measurement is rather tricky .",
    "the predicted cross section enhancements can arrive to a factor 2 , but at relatively large @xmath0 , where events are few .",
    "when the cross sections are integrated over a large mass range ( equivalently , @xmath0 range ) these enhancements are much less evident .    here a montecarlo simulation is organized to study the proposed measurement at compass , and also the case of the panda experiment@xcite at gsi , where the effect is expected to be especially strong .",
    "the montecarlo apparatus is the same as described in ref.@xcite , so all the related details can be found in that group of references .",
    "k - factors ( i.e. overall @xmath17dependent factors renormalizing the cross sections ) have been rewritten so that cross section values follow alternatively the behavior predicted in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "for compass e consider ( negative ) pion - nucleon drell - yan with @xmath2 @xmath11 100 gev@xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the measurement is performed on a fixed target with @xmath19 @xmath11 0.5 .",
    "we produce 50,000 simulated events for 4 @xmath6 m @xmath6 9 gev / c@xmath4 , @xmath20 @xmath21 0 and 1 @xmath6 @xmath22 @xmath6 3 gev / c .",
    "this means about 35,000 events in the lower mass bin 4 - 5 gev / c@xmath4 .",
    "the cut @xmath20 @xmath21 0 is related with the strong possibility that fixed target experiments have reduced acceptance for negative @xmath20 ( see e.g. the event scatter plot in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath22 cutoffs are related with the selection of drell - yan events in strict sense ( see the discussions in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we perform the simulation both for the case of `` normal '' cross sections , and with the enhancement factors shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "so we will speak of `` enhanced '' and `` non enhanced '' data sets .    defining @xmath23 as the overall mass range ,",
    "we divide it into 5 equal subranges , and compare the simulated event population of the larger mass bins with the population of the lowest mass one . since the populations of the lower mass bins are practically equal in the enhanced and non enhanced cases ( about 35,000 events ) , we may limit ourselves to studying the populations of the upper mass bins .",
    "the underying necessary assumption is that these populations are extracted from well normalized samples of 50,000 events .    for each case",
    "( enhanced and non - enhanced cross sections ) the simulation is repeated ten times , so that for each mass bin we may calculate the average number of events and its fluctuation .",
    "the results are shown in fig.1 . in figs . 2 and 3 we show the laboratory angle and energy distributions , useful for the discussion on the feasibility of the measurement .",
    "the statistical fluctuation is small enough to separate clearly the two possible outcomes in each mass bin .",
    "the very last mass bin contains a too small event number , so we forget about it and focus the rest of our analysis on the mass bin 7 - 8 gev / c@xmath4 .",
    "the conclusions are valid for the mass bin 6 - 7 gev / c@xmath4 as well .",
    "\\1 ) the background of random coincidence events with large mass , that in the case of a pion beam is due to coincidence between a beam halo muon with large energy and a collision - originated muon with small energy .",
    "the estimation of the fraction of `` wrong '' pairs in real experiments is normally based on the examination of like - charge pairs .",
    "according to the analysis in ref.@xcite(@xmath2 @xmath25 470 gev@xmath4 ) , and ref.@xcite(@xmath2 @xmath25 250 gev@xmath4 ) , this noise is not a problem since ( i ) the background falls as steeply as the true data frequency at increasing masses , ( i ) it remains at least one order of magnitude below data .",
    "\\2 ) the precision by which the relative acceptances for large and small mass events is estimated .",
    "this is potentially a problem if muons associated with large and small mass events distribute very differently in the laboratory frame phase space .",
    "section 4 of ref.@xcite is devoted to a detailed study of the acceptance , for a @xmath26-nucleus drell - yan experiment that presents some analogies with the compass case .",
    "they show a flat efficiency in dilepton - track reconstruction for mass up to 6.8 gev / c@xmath4 . the case of larger masses",
    "is not shown .    in fig.2",
    "we show the distribution of single muon polar angles in the ( fixed target ) laboratory reference frame .",
    "these muons belong to simulated drell - yan events in the above compass conditions ( without distinguishing between positive and negative muons ) .",
    "the upper panel reports the distribution of 10,000 events belonging to the dilepton mass region 4 - 5 gev / c@xmath4 , the lower panel an equal number of events belonging to the mass region 7 - 8 gev / c@xmath4 .",
    "despite there are differences , the two distributions are similar enough to exclude problems related with differential angular acceptance .    in fig.3",
    "we show the corresponding distributions for the muon laboratory energy . in this case",
    "there are important differences , but the major point is that both distributions assume non - negligible values in a large fraction of all the available energy phase space .",
    "an examination of the @xmath1 correlations shows that for each event @xmath27 @xmath25 constant ( 34 @xmath24 7 gev in the lower mass range , 45 @xmath24 4 gev in the higher mass range ) with a strong level of energy asymmetry @xmath28 @xmath9 @xmath29 . in both cases @xmath28 follows an approximate distribution @xmath30 meaning that most events concentrate towards larger energy asymmetry .",
    "the above analysis means that identifying a dilepton pair requires , at small as at large masses , a good and well understood acceptance level throughout all the energy range , since the typical pair includes both a low - energy and a high - energy muon .",
    "a lack in this sense can decrease seriously the acceptance , but does not necesarily discriminate pairs with different masses .",
    "to better estimates the potential errors introduced by ignorance about energy acceptance , we simulate a really extreme situation : we suppose that the acceptance for single muons with energy @xmath6 20 gev is reduced by 50 % and one is not aware of this . in other words ,",
    "one is convinced that the apparatus acceptance is @xmath25 1 at all energies , but this is true for @xmath31 @xmath21 20 gev only . in this case",
    "the fraction of silently lost pairs is          so , the lack of knowledge about true acceptance would lead to an error 20 % in the estimation of the relative population of the two mass bins .",
    "the proposed examples are really pessimistic ones , since normally acceptance is reconstructed with far larger precision than this . despite this ,",
    "also in these situations the event ratio reconstruction is precise enough to estimate the searched enhancement factor .    for panda ( gsi )",
    "we consider @xmath32 drell - yan with @xmath2 @xmath11 30 gev@xmath4 , in the mass range 2 - 4.5 gev@xmath4 .",
    "the other cuts are the same as for the compass case . to avoid influence by the @xmath33 region on the event normalization , we normalize the collected data set with the requirement : 40,000 events in the mass range 2 - 2.5 gev / c@xmath4 . for masses between 2.5 and 3.5",
    "gev / c@xmath4 we base the simulation on drell - yan data by ref.@xcite at large @xmath20 , where gluon - gluon @xmath33 production is partially suppressed as it would happen at panda .",
    "this still leaves room for a large uncertainty factor in the @xmath33 production rates ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "we assume the threshold enhancement to be the same for the @xmath33 peak and for the background . as evident from fig.4 , for masses over 3.5 gev",
    "/ c@xmath4 event numbers increase by one order and there is no doubt on the benefit panda would receive from the enhancement .    to summarize ,",
    "the threshold enhancement can be verified with satisfactory precision in the compass apparatus for pion beams .",
    "the enhancement would be much more striking at panda ( gsi ) , with large increases in the counting rates at masses @xmath21 3.5 gev / c@xmath4 .",
