    "future wireless networks are expected to support a variety of services with diverse quality of service ( qos ) requirements . because of the hostile characteristics of wireless channels and scarcity of radio resources such as energy and bandwidth , efficient resource allocation schemes are necessary for design of high - performance wireless networks .",
    "the objective is to use the radio resources as efficiently as possible and at the same time satisfy the qos requirements of the users which can be expressed in terms of constraints on rate , delay or fidelity .    since in most practical scenarios , the users terminals are battery - powered , energy efficient resource allocation is crucial to prolonging the battery life of the terminals . in this work ,",
    "we study the cross - layer problem of qos - constrained joint power and rate control in wireless networks using a game - theoretic framework .",
    "we consider a multiple - access network and propose a non - cooperative game in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power and rate in such a way as to maximize its energy - efficiency ( measured in bits per joule ) and at the same time satisfy its qos requirements .",
    "the qos constraints are in terms of the average source rate and average total delay ( transmission plus queueing delay ) .",
    "we derive the nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game and use this framework to study tradeoffs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency .",
    "network capacity here refers to the maximum number of users that can be accommodated by the network .",
    "joint power and rate control with qos constraints have been studied extensively for multiple - access networks ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study joint power and rate control under bit - error rate ( ber ) and average delay constraints .",
    "@xcite considers the problem of globally optimizing the transmit power and rate to maximize throughput of non - real - time users and protect the qos of real - time users .",
    "neither work takes into account energy - efficiency .",
    "recently tradeoffs between energy efficiency and delay have gained more attention .",
    "the tradeoffs in the single - user case are studied in @xcite@xcite . the multiuser problem in turn",
    "is considered in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present a centralized scheduling scheme to transmit the arriving packets within a specific time interval such that the total energy consumed is minimized whereas in @xcite , a distributed aloha - type scheme is proposed for achieving energy - delay tradeoffs .",
    "joint power and rate control for maximizing goodput in delay - constrained networks is studied in @xcite .",
    "this work is the first study of qos - constrained power and rate control in multiple - access networks using a game - theoretic framework . in our proposed game - theoretic model ,",
    "users choose their transmit powers and rates in a _ competitive _ and _ distributed _ manner in order to maximize their energy efficiency and at the same time satisfy their qos requirements . using this framework",
    ", we also analyze the tradeoffs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency . even though a centralized approach is possible due to presence of an access point ( ap )",
    ", a distributed mechanism is more attractive due to its scalability and low complexity .",
    "it should be noted that game - theoretic approaches to power control have previously been studied in various work ( see for example @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite@xcite do not take into account the effect of delay , and @xcite only considers transmission delay and does not perform any rate control .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ system model ] , we describe the system model . the proposed joint power and rate control game",
    "is discussed in section  [ prcg ] and its nash equilibrium solution is derived in section  [ ne ] .",
    "we then describe an admission control scheme in section  [ admission control ] .",
    "tradeoffs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency are studied in section  [ numerical results ] using numerical results .",
    "finally , we give conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a direct - sequence code - division multiple - access ( ds - cdma ) network and propose a non - cooperative ( distributed ) game in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power and rate to maximize its energy efficiency ( measured in bits per joule ) while satisfying its qos requirements .",
    "we specify the qos constraints of user @xmath0 by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the average source rate and @xmath3 is the upper bound on average delay .",
    "the delay includes both queueing and transmission delays . the incoming traffic is assumed to have a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath4 which represents the average packet arrival rate with each packet consisting of @xmath5 bits . the source rate ( in bit per second ) is hence given by @xmath6 .",
    "the user transmits the arriving packets at a rate @xmath7 ( bps ) and with a transmit power equal to @xmath8 watts .",
    "we consider an automatic - repeat - request ( arq ) mechanism in which the user keeps retransmitting a packet until the packet is received at the access point without any errors .",
    "the incoming packets are assumed to be stored in a queue and transmitted in a first - in - first - out ( fifo ) fashion .",
    "the packet transmission time for user @xmath0 is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the time taken for the user to receive an ack / nack from the access point .",
    "we assume @xmath10 is negligible compared to @xmath11 . the packet success probability ( per transmission ) is represented by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sir ) for user  @xmath0 .",
    "the retransmissions are assumed to be independent .",
    "the packet success rate , @xmath14 , is assumed to be increasing and s - shaped ( sigmoidal ) with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this is a valid assumption for many practical scenarios as long as the packet size is reasonably large ( e.g. , @xmath17 bits )",
    ".    we can represent the combination of user @xmath0 s queue and wireless link as an m / g/1 queue , as shown in figure  [ fig1-sys ] , where the traffic is poisson with parameter @xmath4 ( in packets per second ) and the service time , @xmath18 , has the following probability mass function ( pmf ) : @xmath19 as a result , the service rate , @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 and the load factor @xmath22 .        to keep the queue of user @xmath0 stable",
    ", we must have @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "now , let @xmath25 be a random variable representing the total packet delay for user @xmath0 .",
    "this delay includes the time the packet spends in the queue as well as the service time .",
    "it is known that for an m / g/1 queue the average wait time ( including the queueing and service time ) is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the variance of the service time @xcite .",
    "therefore , the average packet delay for user @xmath0 is given by @xmath29 we require the average delay for user @xmath0 s packets to be less than or equal to @xmath3 .",
    "this translates to @xmath30 or @xmath31 however , since @xmath32 , is possible only if requires an infinite sir which is not practical . ]",
    "@xmath33 this means that @xmath4 and @xmath3 are feasible only if they satisfy . note that the upper bound on the average delay ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) can not be smaller than transmission time @xmath34 .",
    "this automatically implies that @xmath35 .",
    "let us define @xmath36 .",
    "then , is equivalent to the condition @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the delay constraint in translates into a lower bound on the output sir .",
    "it should be noted that the delay qos constraint considered here is in terms of average delay .",
    "an average - delay constraint may not be sufficient for applications with hard delay requirements ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion on the delay distribution ) .",
    "consider the non - cooperative joint power and rate control game ( prcg ) @xmath41 $ ] where @xmath42 is the set of users , @xmath43\\times[0,b]$ ] is the strategy set for user @xmath0 with a strategy corresponding to a choice of transmit power and transmit rate , and @xmath44 is the utility function for user @xmath0 .",
    "here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the maximum transmit power and the system bandwidth , respectively . for the sake of simplicity , throughout this paper , we assume @xmath45 is large .",
    "each user chooses its transmit power and rate in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its qos requirements .",
    "the utility function for a user is defined as the ratio of the user s goodput to its transmit power , i.e. , @xmath47 where the goodput @xmath48 is the number of bits that are transmitted successfully per second and is given by @xmath49 therefore , the utility function for user @xmath0 is given by @xmath50 this utility function has units of bits per joule and is particularly suitable for wireless networks where energy efficiency is important .    fixing other users transmit powers and rates , the utility - maximizing strategy for user @xmath0",
    "is given by the solution of the following constrained maximization : @xmath51 or equivalently @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 note that for a matched filter receiver and with random spreading sequences , the received sir is approximately given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the channel gain for user @xmath0 and @xmath57 is the noise power in the bandwidth @xmath46 .",
    "let us first look at the maximization in without any constraints , i.e. , @xmath58    the unconstrained utility maximization in has an infinite number of solutions . more specifically ,",
    "any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath7 that achieves an output sir equal to @xmath59 , the solution to @xmath60 , maximizes @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be any power - rate combination such that @xmath63 then , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 this means that when other users powers and rates are fixed ( i.e. , fixed @xmath66 ) , user @xmath0 s utility depends only on @xmath67 and is independent of the specific values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 . in addition , by taking the derivative of @xmath68 with respect to @xmath69 and equating it to zero , it can be shown that @xmath68 is maximized when @xmath70 , the ( unique ) positive solution of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 is maximized for any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath7 for which @xmath71 .",
    "this means that there are infinitely many solutions for the unconstrained maximization in .",
    "the second constraint in can equivalently be expressed as @xmath72 therefore , the maximization in is equivalent to @xmath73    let us define @xmath74 note that for @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 and hence @xmath77 . also , define @xmath78 as the rate for which @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 .",
    "this means that based on , user @xmath0 has no incentive to transmit at a rate smaller than @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , based on theorem  1 , any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath84 that results in an output sir equal to @xmath59 is a solution to the constrained maximization in .",
    "note that when @xmath85 and @xmath71 , we have @xmath86 .",
    "for a non - cooperative game , a nash equilibrium is defined as a set of strategies for which no user can unilaterally improve its own utility @xcite .",
    "we saw in section  [ prcg ] that for our proposed non - cooperative game , each user has infinitely many strategies that maximize the user s utility . in particular ,",
    "any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath7 for which @xmath71 and @xmath87 is a best - response strategy .    if @xmath88 , then the prcg has at least one nash equilibrium given by @xmath89 , for @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath78 is given by .",
    "furthermore , when there are more than one nash equilibrium , @xmath92 is the pareto - dominant equilibrium .    if @xmath93 then @xmath94 is positive and finite .",
    "now , if we let @xmath95 and @xmath96 , then the output sir for all the users will be equal to @xmath59 which means every user is using its best - response strategy .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 for @xmath97 is a nash equilibrium .    more generally , if we let @xmath98 and provided that @xmath99 , then @xmath100 is a nash equilibrium where @xmath101 .",
    "hence , based on , at nash equilibrium , the utility of user @xmath0 is given by @xmath102 therefore , the nash equilibrium with the smallest @xmath62 achieves the largest utility .",
    "a higher transmission rate for a user requires a larger transmit power by that user to achieve @xmath59 .",
    "this not only reduces the user s utility but also causes more interference for other users in the network and forces them to raise their transmit powers as well which will result in a reduction in their utilities .",
    "this means that the nash equilibrium with @xmath96 and @xmath94 for @xmath97 is the pareto - dominant equilibrium .",
    "based on the feasibility condition given by theorem  2 , let us define the  size \" of user @xmath0 as @xmath103 therefore , the feasibility condition of theorem  2 can be written as @xmath104 note that the qos requirements of user @xmath0 ( i.e. , its source rate @xmath2 and delay constraint @xmath3 ) uniquely determine @xmath78 through and , in turn , determine the size of the user ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) through .",
    "the size of a user is basically an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by that user . a larger source rate or a tighter delay constraint for a user increases the size of the user .",
    "the network can accommodate a set of users if and only if their total size is less than 1 . in section  [ numerical results ] , we use this framework to study the tradeoffs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency .",
    "in section  [ ne ] , we defined the  size \" of a user based on its qos requirements . before joining the network ,",
    "each user calculates its size using and announces it to the access point .",
    "according to , the access point admits those users whose total size is less than 1 .",
    "while the goal of each user is to maximize its own energy efficiency , a more sophisticated admission control can be performed to maximize the total network utility . in other words , out of the @xmath106 users ,",
    "the access point can choose those users for which the total network utility is the largest , i.e. , @xmath107 under the constraint that @xmath108 .",
    "based on , the utility of user @xmath109 at the pareto - dominant nash equilibrium is given by @xmath110 as a result , becomes @xmath111 under the constraint that @xmath108 .    in general ,",
    "obtaining a closed - form solution for is difficult since it depends on the channel gains and sizes of the users . instead , in order to gain some insight ,",
    "let us consider the special case in which all users are at the same distance from the access point .",
    "we first consider the scenario in which the users have identical qos requirements ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) .",
    "if we replace @xmath113 by @xmath114 , then becomes @xmath115 therefore , the optimal number of users for maximizing the total utility in the network is @xmath116 $ ] where @xmath117 $ ] represents the integer nearest to @xmath118 .",
    "now consider another scenario in which there are @xmath119 classes of users .",
    "the users in class @xmath120 are assumed to all have the same qos requirements and hence the same size , @xmath121 .",
    "since we are assuming that all the users are at the same distance from the access point , they all have the same average channel gain .",
    "now , if the access point admits @xmath122 users from class @xmath120 then the total utility is given by @xmath123 provided that @xmath124 .",
    "without loss of generality , let us assume that @xmath125 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath126 is maximized when @xmath127 $ ] with @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "this is because adding a user from class  1 is always more beneficial in terms of increasing the total utility than adding a user from any other class .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the total utility in the network , the access point must admit only users from the class with the smallest size . while this solution maximizes the total network utility , it is not fair .",
    "a more sophisticated admission control mechanism can be used to improve the fairness . in the next section ,",
    "we demonstrate the loss in network energy efficiency if a suboptimal admission control strategy is used .",
    "let us consider the uplink of a ds - cdma system with a total bandwidth of 5mhz ( i.e. , @xmath130mhz ) .",
    "each user in the network has a set of qos requirements expressed as @xmath131 where @xmath2 is the source rate and @xmath3 is the delay requirement ( upper bound on the average total delay ) for user  @xmath0 . as explained in section  [ ne ] , the qos parameters of a user",
    "define a  size \" for that user , denoted by @xmath105 given by . before a user starts transmitting",
    ", it must announce its size to the access point .",
    "based on the particular admission policy , the access point decides whether or not to admit the user . for the cases where there are multiple equilibria , we assume that the admitted users agree to choose the transmit powers and rates that correspond to the pareto - dominant nash equilibrium .",
    "this is an important assumption that requires its own study .",
    "figure  [ utilvsdelay ] shows the user s utility as a function of delay for different source rates .",
    "the total size of the other users in the network is assumed to be 0.2 .",
    "the user s utility is normalized by @xmath132 , and the delay is normalized by the inverse of the system bandwidth .",
    "as expected , a tighter delay requirement and/or a higher source rate results in a lower utility for the user .",
    "figure  [ delayqos ] shows the user size , network capacity , transmission rate , and total goodput as a function of normalized delay for different source rates .",
    "the network capacity refers to the maximum number of users that can be admitted into the network assuming that all the users have the same qos requirements ( i.e. , the same size ) .",
    "the transmission rate and goodput are normalized by the system bandwidth .",
    "the total goodput is obtained by multiplying the source rate by the total number of users . as the qos requirements become more stringent ( i.e. , a higher source rate and/or a smaller delay ) , the size of the user increases which means more network resources are required to accommodate the user .",
    "this results in a reduction in the network capacity .",
    "it is also observed from the figure that when the delay constraint is loose , the total goodput is almost independent of the source rate .",
    "this is because a lower source rate is compensated by the fact that more users can be admitted into the network . on the other hand , when the delay constraint in tight , the total goodput is higher for larger source rates .    now to study admission control ,",
    "let us consider a network with three different classes of users / sources :    1 .",
    "class @xmath133 users for which @xmath134kbps and @xmath135ms , and hence , @xmath136 .",
    "class @xmath46 users for which @xmath137kbps and @xmath138ms , and hence , @xmath139 .",
    "class @xmath119 users for which @xmath140kbps and @xmath141ms , and hence , @xmath142 .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , let us assume that there are a large number of users in each class and that they all are at the same distance from the access point ( i.e. , they all have the same average channel gain ) .",
    "the access point receives requests from the users and has to decide which ones to admit in order to maximize the total utility in the network ( see ) .",
    "we know from section  [ admission control ] that since users in class @xmath133 have the smallest size , the total utility is maximized if the access point picks users from class @xmath133 only with @xmath143=25 $ ] .",
    "however , this solution does not take into account fairness issues .",
    "instead , we may be more interested in solutions in which more than one class of users are admitted .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the percentage loss in the total utility for several choices of @xmath144 and @xmath145 .    .",
