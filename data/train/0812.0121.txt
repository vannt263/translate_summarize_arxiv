    "a number of extensions of the standard model suggest that lorentz invariance ( li ) is only a low - energy approximation and it may be deformed at very high energies , e.g. , approaching the planck scale @xmath3 ev @xcite . in a simple form shown by coleman and glashow , lorentz invariance violation ( liv )",
    "can be expressed as a modified energy - momentum relation @xmath4 , under the assumption that li is violated perturbatively in the context of conventional quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it can also be interpreted in terms of different maximal attainable velocities for different particles .",
    "modified energy - momentum relation with liv terms proportional to the cube of the momentum , or a higher power , are also considered @xcite . although li has been confirmed at accelerators up to @xmath5 tev for protons@xcite , 104.5 gev for electrons and 300 gev for photons@xcite , it is still possible to see liv in astrophysical processes with much higher energy , especially in the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energies above @xmath6 ev @xcite .",
    "since the gyration radius of uhecrs is larger than the height of our galaxy in the galactic magnetic field , uhecrs are generally thought to be of extragalactic origin .",
    "propagating through intergalactic space , the uhecrs will interact with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , which results in energy and flux depletion .",
    "in particular , the photomeson process will induce a suppression in the spectrum above @xmath7 ev and lead to the well - known greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of uhecrs can be calculated theoretically by assuming the source distribution and injection energy spectrum .",
    "the energy loss processes for uhecrs propagating in the intergalactic space include photopion production and @xmath0 pair production when interacting with cmb , as well as the adiabatic energy loss due to the expansion of the universe @xcite . because of the short mean - free path of photopion production , the spectrum of uhecrs above @xmath8 ev falls sharply and results in the gzk cutoff .",
    "however , measurements of the uhecr spectrum have led to great confusion in the last decade .",
    "the result of the akeno - agasa experiment clearly shows an extension of the spectrum beyond the gzk cutoff @xcite . to account for the agasa data beyond the gzk cutoff",

    "even a liv parameter as small as @xmath9 may lead to the removal of gzk cutoff@xcite .",

    "we then solve the propagation equation of uhe protons in an expanding universe after incorporating the liv effect in the energy loss rate of protons .",

    "the pair production occurs at lower energy and the liv effect might be less significant . to incorporate the liv effect into the @xmath0 production process , the analysis will be more complicated .",
    "in addition , we need to restrict the treatment to the case @xmath116 . this has been shown to be due to the weakness of the presentation of the theory .",
    "we are unable to determine whether the perturbation term comes from the initial proton or the final state proton , which have different energy in the ls @xcite .    in this work",
    "the composition of uhecrs is assumed to be pure proton .",
    "however , the composition of uhecrs is poorly known from the experimental point of view .",
    "the observations of hires show that the uhecrs are proton dominant @xcite , while the results from the auger experiment indicate a mediate mass composition @xcite .",
    "the determination of the uhecr composition depends on the interaction model and has a relatively large uncertainty at present . if the uhecrs are heavy nuclei dominant , the main process during the propagation in the cmb photon field is photo - disintegration , which will lead to the change of the composition and energy of primary cosmic rays and , accordingly , form a gzk - like spectrum @xcite .",
    "we can make a rough estimate of the liv effect in such a case , by assuming the primary composition of uhecrs to be iron and considering the process @xmath117 .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified by assuming @xmath118 , while the physics is not changed as only the difference of the @xmath94 s in the initial and final states is relevant for the kinematics@xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the interaction of photo - disintegration is possible only if @xmath119 , resulting in @xmath120 \\approx-2\\times10^{-25}[\\epsilon/\\epsilon_0]^2 $ ] for cmb energy @xmath121ev . on the other hand ,",
    "the spontaneous fragmentation @xmath122 should be forbidden for iron with energy lower than @xmath123ev since cosmic rays with such energies have been detected .",
    "this condition requires @xmath124 , which gives @xmath125 for @xmath126ev .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath127 . it should be noted that the above estimates are quite rough .",
    "it will be more complicated to use the uhecr spectrum to study the liv effects for heavy nuclei because there will be a chain of nuclei species taking effect in the interactions .",
    "further detailed analysis is needed to probe the liv if the uhecrs are proved to be heavy nuclei in future experiments .",
