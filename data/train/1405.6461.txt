    "there are many approaches to quantum theory of gravity where bekenstein - hawking entropy ( @xmath0 ) of black holes @xcite can be derived @xcite . in many cases they lead to power - law and logarithmic corrections .",
    "ever since bombelli et al @xcite and srednicki @xcite showed that entanglement entropy ( ee ) of a massless free scalar field , in it s ground state in flat spacetime , is proportional to the area of the horizon , ee is considered as one of the most promising candidates as a source of @xmath0 or a quantum correction to the same .",
    "ee is defined as the entropy due to entanglement between degrees of freedom ( dof ) on the two sides of an entangling surface ( or the so - called horizon ) .",
    "one can argue that the computation of ee in @xcite did not involve black hole geometry as such .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite certain modes of gravitational perturbations in black - hole space - times behave as minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "further , the hamiltonian for a scalar field in schwarzschild background can be shown ( using general linear transformations in lamaitre coordinates ) to be equivalent to that in a flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "ee in fact takes into account the most important physical effect of an event horizon , that is to block information to an outside observer . using this so - called real time approach or non - geometric approach",
    ", it has also been shown that ee in presence of excited and mixed states @xcite lead to power - law corrections @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a logarithmic correction is found by numerically fitting the non - geometric ee and the resulting coefficient was in agreement with that predicted by geometric approaches @xcite .    in recent years",
    "ee is found to be playing crucial roles in understanding many quantum phenomena and their applications @xcite .",
    "deriving ee , in non - geometric approach , analytically in 3d ( 3 space and 1 time dimension ) field theory is difficult and exact results has only been found numerically .",
    "however , ee has been derived analytically ( for rindler horizons ) using path integral methods @xcite and in the context of 2d and 4d conformal field theories ( as the so - called geometric entropy ) using the replica method @xcite .",
    "this method is also applied to compute ee for horizons with conical singularities @xcite a logarithmic correction term is found in even spacetime dimensions .",
    "the holographic definition of ee @xcite is an exciting proposal and further attempts are being made to understand its implications @xcite . from an information theoretic perspective , plenio et al @xcite have found the bounds on ee analytically in case of a 3d cartesian lattice and planar entangling surfaces .",
    "it is widely accepted that ee obeys the so - called area law ( in case of @xmath1 in flat spacetime ) . from dimensional arguments @xcite",
    ", one can write down the subleading terms too . the computational algorithm in the non - geometric approach as presented in @xcite , is straightforward and unambiguous though , is impossible to be carried out completely analytically .",
    "remarkably , the output of all the complicated numerical evaluation is a simple area law .",
    "this observation indicates that it might be possible to derive the dominant term which is proportional to the area _ analytically _ using some reasonable approximations .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the dof near the entangling surface contributes the most to the total entropy .",
    "thus to be able to find the leading term , it is appropriate to consider entanglement among the near horizon dof only while neglecting the rest . with this reasonable approximation ,",
    "we show that , the resulting ee , derived analytically , follows an area law .",
    "let us define , @xmath2 to be the ee due to all the entangled dof inside and outside the horizon and @xmath3 is defined as the ee due to correlation among the near horizon dof that are residing just across the horizon .",
    "arguably , the dof responsible for entropy of a black hole also resides near the black hole horizon @xcite . in this sense",
    ", @xmath3 is the dominant quantity in the context of @xmath0 and here we compute the same analytically .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the standard algorithm @xcite to compute ee for a real free massless scalar field propagating in @xmath4-dimensional flat space - time ( for spherical horizon ) . in section iii",
    ", we analytically derive @xmath3 which is proportional to area .",
    "we also cross - check our result through numerical computations that further reveals a positive logarithmic correction .",
    "we compare these results regarding @xmath3 with @xmath2 in the lights of @xcite to determine the role of the dof away from the horizon .",
    "we generalise our calculations for spherical entangling surfaces in any dimension",
    ". then the ratio of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , computed numerically , is shown to be tending to unity with increasing dimension of space .",
    "finally , we summarise with a discussion on the implications of our results and related open issues in section v.",
    "the hamiltonian is given by h & = & d^3x .",

    "the operators defined above are hermitian and obey the appropriate commutation relations . integrating over",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 directions yield : h = _ m _ 0^dr to regularize , one discretizes the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) along the radial direction with lattice spacing @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that contributions of the modes with linear momentum above @xmath10 are exponentially suppressed .",
    "the lattice is terminated at a large but finite @xmath11 ( we have chosen @xmath12 for numerical computations ) .",
    "an intermediate point @xmath13 is chosen , such that @xmath14 represents a point on the ( imaginary ) spherically symmetric entangling surface or the _ horizon _ with radius @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , that separates the lattice points between the _ inside _ and _",

    "the resulting @xmath22 is a mixed state of a bipartite system .",

    "can be written as_red ~ where : = (    ll a & b + b^t & c +    )  ,  = b^ta^-1b  ,  = c-   .",
    "the gaussian nature of the above density matrix lends itself to a series of diagonalizations vv^t = _ d ,  _ d^- v v^t _ d^- , w ",
    "w^t = _d , v_j v w^t ( v v^t)^ vt such that it reduces to a product of @xmath29 , @xmath30-oscillator density matrices , in each of which one oscillator is traced over : _ _ red ~_j=1^n - n  .",
    "the corresponding entropy is given by : s _",
    "j=1^n - n ( - - _ j ) where _ j = .",
    "thus , for the full hamiltonian @xmath31 , the entropy is : ee = _ = 0^ ( 2 + 1 ) s _ , where the degeneracy factor @xmath32 follows from spherical symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "note that the above sum will not converge in dimensions larger than four .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , @xmath3 can be regarded as the most dominant contribution to the @xmath2 . here",
    "we compute @xmath3 analytically using the same algorithm presented in the previous section . to take into account only the near horizon dof",
