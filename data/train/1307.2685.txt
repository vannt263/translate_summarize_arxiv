    "our traditional understanding of brownian motion is that of a solute getting kicked randomly by surrounding solvent molecules .",
    "einstein s seminal contribution had been to derive the diffusion equation  and in particular an explicit expression for the diffusion coefficient  based on this insight  @xcite .",
    "one route to derive brownian motion from more fundamental equations is fluctuating hydrodynamics  @xcite , which augments the linearized navier - stokes equations with a random stress tensor obeying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . integrating out the fluid velocity field , the stochastic equation of motion for a solvated particle",
    "can then be derived , which takes on the form of a generalized langevin equation  @xcite .",
    "this approach is not without problems since the correlations of the random stress tensor near the solute are assumed to be the same as those in the isotropic bulk fluid .",
    "there is , however , evidence that the presence of rigid bodies influences the local stress fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this brief report is to give a somewhat alternative view on the dynamics of solvated particles , a view in which brownian motion arises from suppressing solvent fluctuations . instead of the stress ,",
    "we consider directly the ( memoryless ) fluctuations of the solvent velocity .",
    "we employ gaussian field theory  @xcite to study how a solute modifies these velocity fluctuations in its vicinity .",
    "gaussian field theory has been applied successfully to , e.g. , dielectric relaxation dynamics  @xcite and the hydrophobic effect  @xcite . in analogy to the modification of density fluctuations due to the excluded volume of the solute , we show that imposing a solvent velocity on the solute - solvent interface leads to a flow and diminishes solvent velocity fluctuations in the vicinity of the solute .",
    "loosely speaking , the solvent loses entropy , which is compensated by the random motion of the solute .",
    "we consider an incompressible quiescent fluid with bulk viscosity @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that in the absence of any solvated object the probability @xmath1=\\exp\\{-{\\mathcal s}_0[{{\\mathbf u}}]\\}$ ] to observe a given history of velocity fluctuations @xmath2 away from zero is gaussian with action @xmath3 = \\frac{1}{2 } { \\int{\\mathrm{d}}t}{\\int{\\mathrm{d}}^3{{\\mathbf r}}{\\mathrm{d}}^3{{\\mathbf r}}'\\ ; }    { { \\mathbf u}}({{\\mathbf r}},t)\\cdot{\\boldsymbol\\chi}_0^{-1}({{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}')\\cdot{{\\mathbf u}}({{\\mathbf r}}',t).\\ ] ] the functional inverse of @xmath4 is defined through @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the identity matrix . normalization of @xmath7 is achieved through choosing the appropiate functional measure @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "clearly , the matrix @xmath4 is related to the velocity correlations , @xmath9 the brackets denote averages over different realizations of the velocity field , whereas the subscript indicates the pure solvent .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) implies temporally uncorrelated velocity fluctuations .",
    "we know that this is not strictly correct as hydrodynamics predicts a power law tail for the particle velocity autocorrelation function  @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , here we aim for a simple markovian description which is appropriate for sufficiently coarse - grained time .",
    "brownian motion in confined geometries such as nanopores  @xcite might require to take into account memory .",
    "now image that an external force density @xmath10 acts on the solvent .",
    "up to linear order , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite relates this force to an instantaneous mean velocity profile @xmath11 through the correlations eq .  .",
    "the factor @xmath12 originates from the time integration over the @xmath13-function .",
    "of course , eq .   is nothing else than faxen s theorem , from which we can deduce the correlations @xmath14 using the oseen tensor  @xcite .",
    "however , we will not need an explicit expression for @xmath4 in the following .",
    "we solvate a particle expelling the fluid from the volume @xmath15 the particle occupies . for the clarity of presentation",
    ", we consider a spherical particle . then rotational and translational diffusion decouple and in the following we focus on the translational diffusion .",
    "the particle is described by its instantaneous velocity @xmath16 . by choosing the velocity correlations eq .",
    "we assume a time scale separation between the relaxation time of the fluid and the time scale on which the solvated particle diffuses . from the perspective of the solute it thus appears as if the solvent responds _ instantaneously _ with a mean flow profile @xmath17 to a change of @xmath16 .    to calculate this flow profile ,",
    "we exploit the time scale separation through fixing @xmath16 and consider the generating function @xmath18 \\equiv { \\int[{\\mathrm{d}}{{\\mathbf u}}]}{\\int[{\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol\\psi}]\\ ; } e^{-{\\mathcal s}_0+{\\text i}c+{\\int{\\mathrm{d}}t}{\\int{\\mathrm{d}}^3{{\\mathbf r}}\\;}{\\boldsymbol\\phi}({{\\mathbf r}},t)\\cdot{{\\mathbf u}}({{\\mathbf r}},t)}\\ ] ] with conjugate field @xmath19 .",
    "we implement the `` no - slip '' or `` stick '' boundary condition such that the fluid layer on the particle surface has the same velocity as the moving particle .",

    "we evaluate the path integrals in eq .   in two steps .",

    "couples to the vector @xmath27 where @xmath28 . performing the integration over the auxiliary vector field @xmath29",

    "it is straightforward to calculate the mean flow profile as the functional derivative @xmath37 with respect to the conjugate field . using @xmath38_{ij}\\delta(t - t')\\ ] ] together with the symmetry property @xmath39",
    "we obtain @xmath40 for @xmath28 , we can use eq .   to show that @xmath41 as required .",
    "[ fig : solv](a ) shows schematically how the imposed surface velocity generates the flow at @xmath33 in the solvent through a concatenation of the tensors @xmath34 and @xmath4 .",
    "the presence of the solute not only causes a flow but also alters the solvent velocity fluctuations .",
    "the correlations are calculated as @xmath42_{ij }    = \\left.{\\frac{\\delta ^2\\ln q}{\\delta \\phi_i({{\\mathbf r}},t)\\delta\\phi_j({{\\mathbf r}}',t)}}\\right|_{{\\boldsymbol\\phi}=0}\\ ] ] and read @xmath43 for @xmath44 . for either @xmath45 or @xmath46 ,",
    "i.e. , directly on the particle surface , the correlations vanish . far away from the particle in the bulk",
    "they become those of the pure solvent , @xmath47 .",
    "comparing the result eq .   with the linear response relation eq .",
    ", we see that it corresponds to a force density that is confined to the solute - solvent interface and given by @xmath48 the total force exerted by the particle follows from integrating this force density over the particle surface , @xmath49 this is a linear relation between force and velocity , allowing us to identify @xmath50 as the friction tensor . in appendix",
    "[ sec : trans ] , @xmath50 is calculated explicitly from eq .   for a spherical particle .",
    "so far , we have treated the particle velocity @xmath16 as given . inspecting eq .",
    ", we see that for @xmath51 the generating function reduces to the path probability to observe spontaneous solvent velocity fluctuations that are compatible with the boundary condition of a uniform velocity on the solute surface .",
    "hence , @xmath52\\sim q[{\\boldsymbol\\phi}=0]$ ] is the path weight of a history of particle velocities with @xmath53 \\equiv    \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{4}{\\int{\\mathrm{d}}t\\;}{\\mathbf v}(t)\\cdot{\\mathbf d}^{-1}\\cdot{\\mathbf v}(t )    \\right\\},\\ ] ] which corresponds to the path weight of a free , overdamped brownian particle .",
    "the diffusion tensor @xmath54 is given by the well - known einstein relation connecting diffusion to friction through the fluid temperature .",
    "the formalism introduced here is not restricted to spherical particles but can be used to obtain the friction tensors for arbitrarily shaped objects , e.g. , colloidal clusters with complex shapes  @xcite .",
    "its practical use is somewhat hampered by the difficulties to determine @xmath34 explicitly , which amounts to the inversion of @xmath4 on the two dimensional sub - manifold of the solute surface . except for simple shapes ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ sec : trans ] ) this has to be done numerically , possibly through an expansion of @xmath26 into a suitable matrix basis .",
    "rotational diffusion , and its coupling to translational diffusion , can be treated straightforwardly as demonstrated in appendix  [ sec : rot ] .",
    "another advantage of the presented formalism is that we are not restricted to use the correlations eq .",
    "holding for an unbounded solvent .",
    "for example , one might calculate the _ pure _ solvent correlations @xmath55 in some geometry numerically ( e.g. , using fluctuating lattice boltzmann simulations  @xcite ) and use these correlations to obtain the diffusion coefficients of differently shaped objects moving in this geometry .",
    "i thank david chandler for introducing me to gaussian field theory .",

    "to demonstrate the validity of the present formalism , we explicitly calculate the friction tensor for a spherical particle with radius @xmath56 via eq .  .",
