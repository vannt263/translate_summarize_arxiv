    "sometimes , the robustness of a product is as important as or even more important than its performance .",
    "so , to focus on the trade - off between robustness and performance of a product is meaningful . for such problems , namely multi - objective robust optimization problems ( morop ) ,",
    "it is important to obtain design solutions that are both optimal and robust .",
    "there exist some robustness indices  ( ri ) for morop in the literature .",
    "in fact , how to account for the variations in design parameters and how to measure robustness is a widely discussed problem  @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", the design parameters can be divided into two types , design variables  ( dvs ) , which can be controlled by the designer , and design environment parameters  ( deps ) , which are uncontrollable parameters .",
    "existing works mainly focus on the small variations in dvs and deps  @xcite . moreover , some previous work focused on the variations in the performance function model  @xcite . toward moop ,",
    "the designer s preference is also a type of variation in morop  @xcite .    besides the small variations in dvs and deps , there may be large variations in deps in some engineering problems .",
    "for instance , the actual wind speed may vary greatly in a short time for a wind turbine rotor . in some areas ,",
    "the environment temperature can fluctuate greatly between daytime and night . as a matter of fact",
    ", the problem with regard to large variations in deps can be considered as a special dynamic optimization problem , where the performance function and/or the constraints change with time  @xcite .    one way to distinguish between small variations and large variations in design parameters",
    "is whether they are uncertain or not  @xcite .",
    "another way to distinguish between small and large variations is whether a linearization is reasonable over the range of variations .",
    "the distinction between small and large variations is commonly presented as local versus global sensitivity analysis in the literature on sensitivity analysis  @xcite .",
    "the concept of large variations has been discussed in  @xcite for comparing the difference between the linear and nonlinear performance functions .",
    "nevertheless , in those discussions with regard to large variations , most of the existing criteria for morop aim at finding a design solution that gives desirable means , variances , quantiles or probabilities of violating constraints based on the distributions of the performance and constraint values with respect to the variations in the design parameters .",

    "the small variations in design parameters refer to the ones that have small effect on the performance functions .",
    "the large variations in design parameters refer to the ones that have large effect on the performance functions .",
    "accordingly , a post - optimality sensitivity analysis technique for multi - objective robust optimization problems is discussed while considering both small and large variations in design parameters .",

    "the optimization problem  ( [ moop1 ] ) generally has more than one optimal solutions .",
    "those solutions are defined as pareto optimal solutions , which can not be dominated by any other feasible solution  @xcite .",
    "the set of all pareto optimal solutions is called pareto optimal set and named @xmath12 .",
    "the pareto optimal solutions lie on a boundary in the performance function space ( pf - space ) , called pareto front .",

    "the robustness of a product is defined as follows :    [ def : robustness0 ] robustness is a product s ability to maintain its performances under conditions of varying parameters .",
    "robust design , a term originally introduced by genichi taguchi  @xcite , is a way of improving the quality of a product by minimizing the effect of variations , without eliminating the causes themselves .",
    "many researchers refer to robustness  @xcite .",

    ", we define the robust design as follows :    [ def : robust design ] the design of a product is robust if and only if the performances of the good under design is as little sensitive as possible to variations and uncertainties .",
    "a morop aims to find out a solution that is feasible , optimal and robust . to come up with an feasible , optimal and robust design ,",
    "the three following scenarios have been identified .    1 .   * optimal design and robust design are equally important : * it means that performance functions and robustness functions are optimized simultaneously .",
    "the designer can use the new performance functions by adding the effects of robustness , instead of original performance functions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the robustness functions can be considered as new constraints  @xcite or additional optimization objectives  @xcite .",

    "* robust design is primary and optimal design is secondary : * the final solution is selected from the most robust solutions based on the values of the performance functions  @xcite .    in this paper , the optimal design is supposed to be of primary importance and the robust design of secondary importance .",
    "although there exist some papers dealing with this method  @xcite , which is also called as post - optimality sensitivity analysis , the final solution is selected from the pareto optimal set based on its robustness . moreover , in this paper we consider both small variations in design parameters and large variations in deps simultaneously .",
    "two robustness indices  ( ri ) are introduced in this section .",
    "then , the concept of rf - space is presented and the solution robustness is defined as a vector in the rf - space .",
    "finally , a discussion on this new method is presented .",
    "figure  [ ir_s_moop ] illustrates the solutions of a simple multi - objective optimization problem .",
    "it has two performance functions ( @xmath13,@xmath14 , ) , some dvs ( @xmath15 ) and deps ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "let us select solution  a , solution  b and solution  c , which are located on the pareto front .",
    "when there are small variations in dvs and deps , then their performances varies in the grey area around their nominal values in the pf - space , as shown in  fig .",
    "[ ir_s_moop ] .",
    "obviously , in the pf - space , solution  b has smaller variations around its nominal values than solutions  a and  c. it means than solution  b is more robust than solutions  a and  c. however , the size of the grey areas associated with solution a and solution c are the same , but their shapes are different .",
    "so the comparison between the robustness of solution a and solution c is not an easy task . toward the different types of uncertainties ,",
    "there are different methods to define ri for moop , such as using the worst case scenario  @xcite , the expectancy measure  @xcite , and the probabilistic threshold method  @xcite .",

    "the actual performances are distributed around the nominal values . in the pf - space ,",
    "the actual performances follow a multivariate distribution . here , in order to simplify the index associated with each performance function , the standard deviation  @xmath18 of the actual performances is used as a measure for the robustness : the smaller the standard deviation , the more robust the design .",
    "the absolute value of the difference between the expected value  ( @xmath19 ) and the nominal value  ( @xmath20 ) is also a robustness measure : the smaller the absolute difference , the more robust the design .",

    ", we assume that the standard deviation ( @xmath18 ) and the absolute value of the difference between  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 have the same importance for the designer .",
    "moreover , we assume that the robustness of all performance functions has the same importance .",
    "the robustness index @xmath17 of a moop with respect to small variations in dvs and deps is defined as a scalar .",
    "the robustness of each performance function is also normalized . to normalize the sum of the standard deviation ( @xmath21 ) and the absolute difference ( @xmath27 )",
    ", we divide it by the difference between the two extreme values of the @xmath23th performance function , namely , @xmath28 . as a result",
    ", @xmath17 is defined as follows : @xmath29 the smaller  @xmath17 , the more robust the design .",
    "note that even if the variations are small , the constraints may not be satisfied due to variations .",
    "this refers to the robustness of constraints ( reliability ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the index  @xmath17 is not discussed deeply in this paper .",
    "it is just based on the distributions of the performance function values with respect to these small variations . to simplify the index , the reliability with regard to small variations is not considered in this paper .",
    "since the dvs are controllable and the deps are uncontrollable , we assume that there are only large variations in deps .",
    "the mapping functions between the dvs and performance functions can change a lot due to large variations in deps . for a moop while considering large variations in deps , we assume that the initial deps are @xmath30 , the set of feasible solutions is named @xmath31 and the set of pareto optimal solutions is denoted @xmath32 .",
    "it is noteworthy that those pareto optimal solutions are alternative solutions for the designer .",
    "since large variations in deps exist , the deps may change from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "the design environment parameters  @xmath16 are supposed to take @xmath35  discrete values : @xmath36 .",
    "the probability density functions ( pdf ) of @xmath16 are @xmath37 .",
    "the initial deps @xmath33 are equal to the ones having the maximum pdf amongst the @xmath35 discrete values .",
    "the corresponding feasible sets are @xmath38",
    ". a feasible and pareto optimal solution in @xmath39 may not be pareto optimal , and not feasible in the new environments .",
    "to compare the solution s robustness against large variations in deps , the traditional methods are not applicable . toward a moop",
    ", a definition of the solution s robustness against large variations in deps is proposed thereafter :    [ def : robustness ] toward a multi - objective optimization problem against large variations in deps , solution s robustness against large variations in deps is a measure of its ability to be optimal in different design environments .",
    "figure  [ rl - dep - change-1 ] illustrates the solutions of a simple moop .",
    "similarly to fig .",
    "[ ir_s_moop ] , the problem has two objective functions ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) , some dvs ( @xmath15 ) and deps ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the nominal values of deps .",
    "let us consider pareto - optimal solutions  @xmath40 and  @xmath41 as examples .",
    "the grey area shows the variations in performances of solution @xmath40 and solution @xmath41 in the pf - space , under small variations in dvs and deps . as seen before",
    ", we can conclude that solution @xmath41 is more robust than solution @xmath40 with regard to small variations in dvs and deps .    on the contrary",
    ", it may not be the case if there are large variations in deps . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rl - dep - change-1 ] , in a new environment , we assume that when the deps @xmath42 change from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , there are large variations in the pf - space for all the solutions .",
    "for instance , in the pf - space , solution a moves from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , solution b moves from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "both solutions have quite large variations in @xmath47 .",
    "then , the following question remains : _",
    " how can we compare the robustness of solutions  @xmath40 and  @xmath41\"?_.    as shown in fig .",
    "[ rl - dep - change-1 ] , toward solution @xmath40 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the largest distance of the actual performance function values and nominal performance function values in @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , with regard to the small variations in dvs and deps .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the largest distance of the actual performance function values ( assuming only two samples : @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) and nominal performance function values in @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , with regard to large variations in deps . if @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , we can see that the caused actual performance function values of both solution @xmath40 and solution @xmath41 are sufficiently far from their nominal ones , with regard to large variations in deps . as a consequence , we can conclude that the traditional methods , which provide some results based on the difference between actual performance function values and nominal ones , make little sense .",
    "therefore , the method proposed in this paper aims to compare their relative positions in the pf - space associated with the new environment . from figure",
    "[ rl - dep - change-1 ] , we can see that , in the new environment , @xmath56 , solution @xmath40 is still on the new pareto front , which means that it is still one of the best solutions for the designer .",
    "meanwhile , solution @xmath41 is far away from the new pareto front , which means that it is no longer a good choice for the designer . as a result",
    ", we can conclude that solution @xmath40 is more robust than solution @xmath41 with regard to the large variations in deps .    as a result",
    ", a ri with regard to large variations in deps is defined thereafter . toward the discrete probability distribution of deps , mathematically , the ri @xmath57 of a solution  @xmath58",
    "is defined as follows :    [ robustness_index ] @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the feasibility index of the solution ; @xmath61 is the pareto optimality index of the solution ; @xmath62 is the pdf of @xmath16 ; @xmath63 is the individual s ranking in the new environment where @xmath64 and amounts to the number of individuals by which it is dominated amongst the alternative solutions , plus one  @xcite . for a better understanding",
    ", a simple example is shown in fig .",
    "[ rl - rank ] . in a new environment , if a solution is still non dominated by any other solution , then the @xmath61 value will be equal to one for that solution .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath61 value will be lower than one , but greater than zero .",

    "however , since the domain of the deps can be partitioned into many small parts , we can simplify such a problem by using a discrete probability distribution of the deps .    finally , the smaller @xmath57 , the more robust the design with regard to large variations in deps .      in this paper , we consider not only the ri against small variations , @xmath17 , but also the ri against large variations , @xmath57 .",

    "the results show that @xmath97 and @xmath98 , so with regard to large variations in deps , the traditional methods ( results based on the difference of actual performance function values and nominal ones ) make little sense . on the contrary ,",

    "indeed , here is the order of the six solutions from the most robust one to the least robust one based on the @xmath57 index : ( 1 )  c ; ( 1 )  b ; ( 3 )  e ; ( 4 )  d ; ( 5 )  f ; ( 6 )  a.        in summary , the designer can select the final solution from the new pareto front in the rf - space , according to his / her requirement . for example , if the designer prefers the @xmath17 , solution  a should be selected . if the designer prefers the @xmath57 , solution  c should be selected .",
    "in this paper , a new method for solving multi - objective robust optimization problems  ( morop ) has been introduced and two illustrative examples have been given to highlight the main contributions of the paper .",
    "two robustness indices  ( ri ) have been introduced to deal with morop where not only small variations in design variables ( dvs ) and design environment parameters  ( deps ) are considered , but also large variations in deps .",
    "the first robustness index , named  @xmath17 , characterizes the robustness of moop against small variations in dvs and deps .",
    "the second robustness index , named @xmath57 , characterizes the robustness of multi - objective optimization problems  ( moop ) against large variations in deps .",
    "the robustness index  @xmath17 is calculated based on the standard deviations and the differences between the expected values and nominal values of the performances .",
    "the smaller @xmath17 , the more robust the design .",
    "the robustness index  @xmath57 is calculated based on the solution s ability to be optimal in different design environments .",
    "the smaller @xmath57 , the more robust the design . to make a trade - off between the two proposed robustness indices , a concept of robust function space ( rf - space ) has been introduced .",
    "then each pareto optimal solution has a position in the rf - space .",
    "the designer can select the final solution from the pareto optimal set based on its new position in the rf - space .",
    "however , some problems are still not solved .",
    "for instance , it is not always an easy task to claim whether a variation is small or large .",
    "moreover , new formulations for @xmath17 and @xmath57 should be discussed in the future .",
