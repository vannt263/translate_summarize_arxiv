    "recently , products of random matrices have experienced a revival due to new mathematical insights about the statistics of the eigen- and singular values for finite as well as infinite matrix dimensions .",
    "recent progress in the field has made it possible to study a product of an arbitrary number of random matrices of arbitrary size for certain matrix ensembles .",
    "the fact that the number of matrices and their size can be chosen freely , allows discussions of various limits .",
    "this includes macroscopic as well as microscopic structures for infinite matrix dimension , but also the limit where the number of matrices goes to infinite is available .",
    "analogous to the study of individual random matrices , products of random matrices show a rich mathematical structure and various limits have revealed new universality classes , which are important in the physical sciences as well as in mathematics and beyond .",
    "products of random matrices have been applied to a broad spectrum of the physical sciences . to name only a few of them : transport in disordered and chaotic systems  @xcite , matrix - valued diffusions  @xcite , quantum chromodynamics at finite chemical potential  @xcite , yang ",
    "mills theory  @xcite , and percolation theory ( introduction of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , results about products of random matrices have been applied to fields beyond physics , such as the study of wireless telecommunication  @xcite and finance  @xcite as well as directions within mathematics , e.g. free probability  @xcite . in this work",
    "an example of chaotic transport ( cf .",
    "[ sec1 ] ) will be our main motivation , but we discuss the mathematical structure in a completely general setting . hence the results presented in this paper can be directly applied to other situations as well .",
    "note that , even though certain symmetries of random matrices might be conserved under matrix multiplication ( such as unitarity ) , in general a product matrix possesses less symmetry than the individual matrices . in particular , a product of hermitian matrices will not generally be hermitian itself , and the eigenvalues will spread into the complex plane .",
    "this loss of symmetry has let to a particular interest in products of non - hermitian matrices , especially drawn from gaussian ensembles  @xcite .",
    "these random matrix ensembles are also known as ginibre ensembles or wishart ensembles .",
    "the discussion of products of ginibre matrices at finite matrix dimension can be considered as an extension of previous results related to the product of two matrices motivated by applications to quantum chromodynamics at finite chemical potential  @xcite . in our work",
    "we will go beyond the restriction to ginibre ensembles and study a set of general weights only restricted by the invariance under left- and right - multiplication of unitary matrices .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss all three dyson classes in a unified way .",
    "we illustrate the underlying structure with the two particular ensembles of ginibre and jacobi ( truncated unitary ) matrices .",
    "these matrices are directly related to a transport on a closed one - dimensional chaotic chain in an environment as it is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we will show that products of random matrices invariant under left- and right - multiplication of unitary matrices satisfy a weak commutation relation .",
    "this commutation relation holds even for finite matrix dimension and not only for infinite dimension as discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover it has important physical consequences . in the specific example of a closed one - dimensional chaotic chain in an environment it reflects the invariance under reordering of potential wells as long as we do not consider cross correlations .",
    "note that the weak commutation relation presented here is completely general and represents a general physical property of reordering invariance .",
    "for instance the same mechanism implies that communication channels with progressive scattering in wireless telecommunication are invariant under reordering of the clusters of scatterers  @xcite .",
    "a similar commutation relation has previously been discussed in the context of disordered wires with obstacles  citebm:1994 .    in secs .",
    "[ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] we explicitly discuss two explicit realizations of matrix ensembles , namely products of ginibre and jacobi matrices , as well as an intermix of these and apply this result to derive an expression of the lyapunov exponent for the disordered chain proposed in sec .  [ sec1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] is devoted to conclusions and outlook , while some technical details are presented in the appendix .",
    "in this section we consider a model of a unitary evolution .",
    "it differs from a similar quantum evolution discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite by the idea that there is a coupling to an environment .",
    "thus it is more in the spirit of one - dimensional quantum transport in a disordered system  @xcite .",
    "the unitary evolution matrix is taken to be time independent , hence we do not model a diffusive system but a chaotic quantum system , which scatters the particles into an environment . here the environment is also modelled as a chaotic quantum system . due to the coupling to the environment the evolution operator acts non - unitarily on the studied subsystem .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath0 hilbert - spaces of dimension @xmath1 arranged along a ring .",
    "the hilbert - spaces can be constructed by isolated potential wells .",
    "the particles in these wells can jump from one well to a consecutive one only in one direction and can not stay in a well .",
    "thus we have a totally asymmetric quantum transport .",
    "the system is constructed such that each well is coupled to a joint particle bath ( environment ) which can absorb the particles while the total amount of particles ( on the chain and in the bath ) is fixed . moreover",
    "the hamiltonian shall be time independent such that the transfer matrix is given by the unitary matrix @xmath2 the translation matrix , @xmath3 , is defined as @xmath4,\\ ] ] such that particles can jump between consecutive wells in one direction only .",
    "the transport along the chain is determined by the block diagonal matrix @xmath5 where the block matrices , @xmath6 , are rectangular matrices with real ( @xmath7 ) , complex ( @xmath8 ) or quaternion ( @xmath9 ) entries chosen according to dyson s three - fold way @xcite , @xmath10 we set @xmath11 , since we consider a closed chain .",
    "the other three block matrices , @xmath12 , in eq .",
    "are chosen such that @xmath13 is orthogonal ( @xmath7 ) , unitary ( @xmath8 ) , or unitary symplectic ( @xmath9 ) , respectively .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use the standard @xmath14 matrix representation for the quaternion number field , @xmath15 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be the dimension of the hilbert space of the bath and @xmath17 be the one of the chain .",
    "we assume that the jumping as well as the coupling to the bath is a stochastic process .",
    "since we do not assume any additional symmetry breaking condition apart from the dyson classification  @xcite and the totally asymmetric process , the measure for @xmath13 is given by the haar - measure of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "for this purpose we briefly rederive the measure for a rectangular , truncated unitary matrix @xmath22 resulting from @xmath23\\in\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl } \\operatorname{o}(l ) , & \\beta=1,\\\\ \\operatorname{u}(l ) , & \\beta=2,\\\\ { \\rm usp}(2 l ) , & \\beta=4,\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath24 . in order to deal with all three dyson classes in a unified way",
    ", we introduce the variable @xmath25 the measure for the truncated matrix @xmath26 is given by  @xcite @xmath27\\int d[v_1]d[v_2]d[v_3]\\ , \\delta(uu^\\dagger-{{\\mathbbm{1}}}_{\\gamma l}),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] denote the product of all independent differentials ( there are @xmath30 real independent degrees of freedom per matrix entry ) .",
    "the dirac @xmath31-function for matrices is defined by the product of all dirac @xmath31-functions of all independent real entries .",
    "the dirac @xmath31-function ensures that @xmath13 is orthogonal , unitary or unitary symplectic , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to integrate out the irrelevant degrees of of freedom , @xmath12 , which yields  @xcite @xmath32\\theta({{\\mathbbm{1}}}_{\\gamma n_1}-xx^{\\dagger})\\ , { { \\olddet\\nolimits}}^{\\kappa}({{\\mathbbm{1}}}_{\\gamma n_1}-xx^{\\dagger}),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is known as the jacobi ensemble  @xcite and is labelled by a superscript @xmath33 .",
    "the heaviside @xmath34-function for matrices is equal to unity for positive definite matrices and zero otherwise ; and the power of the determinant , @xmath35 , is a constant given by @xmath36 .",
    "the measure   plays an important role in rest of this paper .",
    "the discussion of the truncated unitary matrix , discussed in precious paragraph , can immediately be applied to the case described by eq .  .",
    "integrating over @xmath12 in eq .  , we find @xmath37\\theta({{\\mathbbm{1}}}_{\\gamma n_{\\rm chain}}-xx^{\\dagger})\\ , { { \\olddet\\nolimits}}^{\\kappa}({{\\mathbbm{1}}}_{\\gamma n_{\\rm chain}}-xx^{\\dagger})\\ ] ] with @xmath38 .",
    "the size of the bath , @xmath39 , and the size of the chain , @xmath40 , are independent quantities and one might be interested in the limit where the size of the bath goes to infinite while the size of the chain is kept fixed .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 will be of order @xmath41 , hence we rescale @xmath42 .",
    "thus for @xmath43 the measure of @xmath26 equals a gaussian distribution , @xmath44,\\ ] ] which follows from taking the limit in eq .   without further restrictions .",
    "in particular , we do not need the central limit theorem , since the degrees of freedom are independent of @xmath39 . as a consequence the sub - matrices , see eq .",
    ", are also gaussian distributed , @xmath45.\\ ] ] this is also known as the ginibre ensemble @xcite and is denoted by a superscript @xmath46 .",
    "depending on how large each well is , compared to the environment , one can also consider a mixed product of ginibre and jacobi matrices .",
    "the distributions   and enable us to calculate the spectral statistics of @xmath13 in the sector of the hilbert - space representing the chain . in particular , we can consider the spectral statistics of @xmath47 . note that the eigenvalues of @xmath47 are intimately related to @xmath48 or , equivalently , to the product matrix @xmath49 .",
    "also the lyapunov exponents defined as the logarithm of either the eigenvalues of @xmath50 or of the singular values ( eigenvalues of @xmath51 ) are widely used , see for example refs .",
    "they measure the difference of a vector transported once around the chain by the non - unitary evolution",
    "an important property of products of rectangular random matrices is their relation to products of identically sized square matrices with deformed weights .",
    "the deformations are essentially prefactors of determinants of the random matrices and induce a repulsion from the origin , see refs .",
    "@xcite for particular examples of gaussian weights . in this section",
    "we study this relation for all three dyson classes in a unified way .",
    "we emphasize that we do not specify a particular probability density for the random matrices in this section .",
    "the only assumption we enforce on the independent weights is invariance under one of the three groups @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "we consider the product of @xmath0 rectangular matrices , @xmath55 where the individual matrices @xmath56 have real , complex or quaternion entries according to the dyson index , @xmath30 .",
    "the rank of the product matrix is equal to @xmath57 .",

    "the only assumptions about the weights , @xmath60 , is the invariance under left and right rotations , @xmath61 for all transformations @xmath62 in @xmath63 these probability densities were referred to as isotropic weights in ref .",

    "there seems to be an ambiguity of the resulting measure on the level of the individual random matrix measures .",

    "moreover we can conclude that the @xmath370-point correlation functions as well as the averages over an arbitrary number of ratios of characteristic polynomials follow determinantal ( @xmath8 ) and pfaffian ( @xmath336 ) point processes .",

    "we will only state the quaternion case ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath385 which have a structure closely related to the complex case  .    in the ensuing two subsections",
    "we derive the eigenvalue densities of the complex and quaternion case .",
    "the discussion of the real case ( @xmath7 ) will be postponed to forthcoming publications .",
    "moreover we will consider the more general case   and of a mixed product of ginibre and jacobi matrices .",
    "looking at the joint probability density   it is immediately clear that the corresponding orthogonal polynomials are the monomials @xmath386 and @xmath387 , since the one - point weight is invariant under rotation in the complex phase .",

    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the kernel is given by @xmath391 it follows immediately that the level density is given by @xmath392 where the density inherits the isotropic structure from the one - point weight .",
    "the normalization is chosen such that the integration over the density yields the generic number of non - zero eigenvalues , i.e. @xmath393 . if @xmath394 then there are @xmath395 generic zero modes .",
    "they will be reflected as additional dirac @xmath31-functions in the density",
    ".    the macroscopic limit , @xmath396 and @xmath397 and @xmath398 fixed , of the level density   can be obtained by the scaling @xmath399 .",
    "notice that we do not scale with @xmath400 since the spectrum of those matrices drawn from a truncation of unitary matrices is of order one while the spectrum of the ginibre matrices is of order @xmath401 .",
    "then the macroscopic level density is @xmath402 the easiest way to derive this level density is via the moments of this density @xmath403 employing the stirling formula and approximating the sum by an integral we obtain @xmath404 the macroscopic level density can be read off and it is @xmath405 with the rational function @xmath406.\\ ] ]        usually the domain of the level density @xmath407 is a centred annulus in the complex plane  @xcite . to determine the inner and outer radius of the annulus it is quite convenient that @xmath408 is strictly monotonous increasing on the interval @xmath4090,1]$ ] , i.e. @xmath410 notice that @xmath411 for all @xmath412 ; compare @xmath413 with the exponent of the determinant in eq .  .",

    "note that if we are looking at a square product matrix @xmath202 , i.e. @xmath11 , then it immediately follows that at least one @xmath419 is equal to zero , and therefore that the inner radius vanishes such that the eigenvalues are located within a disk rather than an annulus .",
    "when starting from the induced product matrix , @xmath420 , the level density can be still located within an annulus , see fig .",
    "this mechanism is equivalent to that of induced ginibre matrices  @xcite .        for the ginibre ensemble ( @xmath421 and @xmath422 )",
    "the density , @xmath407 , is the well - known complex unit disc with constant density  @xcite . for general @xmath383 and @xmath422 the macroscopic level density",

    "this integral simplifies in the large @xmath217 limit and we find @xmath432 interestingly the leading term , @xmath433 , vanishes if the size of all potential wells is comparable to the bath , meaning that we have no random matrices drawn from the ginibre ensemble .",
    "any coupling of a ginibre matrix with the bath implies that all particles will be sucked away after one round on the closed chain .",
    "we start from the joint probability density   with the one - point weight  . pursuing the calculation of the corresponding skew - orthogonal polynomials @xmath434 in ref .",

    "one can easily read off the level density which is @xmath443 we have normalized the density to @xmath217 again .",

    "the reason is that the eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs , which results in a repulsion from the real axis .    the radial projection of the level density",
    ", @xmath444 is an interesting quantity in many situations .",
    "for instance , hole probabilities and overcrowding at the origin only depend on the radial distribution . moreover , the radial distribution is often useful for comparisons with numerical simulations because of the drastically improved statistics .",
    "the integral   yields @xmath445 and looks quite similar to the level density of @xmath8 , cf .",
    "eq .  . actually , it yields the same macroscopic limit , @xmath446 cf .",
    ". thus the real part of the lyapunov exponent of the transport model discussed in sec .",

    "we studied some general properties of a product of @xmath0 independent rectangular random matrices for all three dyson classes in a unifying way .",
    "the only assumption on the weights of the individual matrices are their invariance under left- and right - multiplication of orthogonal , unitary and unitary symplectic matrices , respectively .",
    "these weights are also known as isotropic weights  @xcite . in this general context",
    ", we showed that a product of rectangular random matrices is equivalent to a product of square matrices with modified weights .",
    "more strikingly we proved that the individual matrices in the product matrix satisfy a weak commutation relation .",
    "this weak commutation relation tells us that a product of independently distributed square random matrices ( they can also result from rectangular matrices ) is independent of the order of the product when averaging over them .",
    "note that this weak commutation relation has immediate consequences in physical systems .",
    "for the considered example of a closed one- dimensional chaotic chain in an environment , the ordering of the potential wells is irrelevant as long as we do not consider cross correlations .",
    "the same applies to telecommunications where the permutation of consecutive scatterers does not change the spectrum of the channel matrix , see @xcite .",
    "we underline that the weak commutation relation holds at finite matrix dimension and , thus , generalizes a known result for the macroscopic limit of the product of isotropic distributed matrices  @xcite . a weak commutation relation for products of random matrices",
    "has previously been discussed in the context of disordered wires with obstacles  @xcite .",
    "the weak commutation relation holds on the level of matrices and affects therefore many quantities of physical interest , such as eigen- and singular values , but also the eigenvectors .",
    "we focused on the spectral properties ; especially the eigenvalue correlations .",
    "we derived the joint probability density functions for all three dyson classes and for general weights .",
    "in particular , we showed that a product of ginibre matrices , a product of jacobi matrices or an intermix of both kinds of matrices yields a determinantal ( for @xmath8 ) or pfaffian ( for @xmath336 ) point process as it is well - known for many other ensembles , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we derived a representation of the one- and two - point weights in terms of a product of random variables for @xmath222 and in terms of a product of @xmath262 random matrices for @xmath7 .",

    "the numerical simulations performed for the product matrices are in complete agreement with the analytical results .",
    "we also considered the macroscopic limit of such an intermixing product of ginibre and jacobi matrices and derived an explicit representation of the level density in terms of a one - fold integral .",
    "this result agrees with the implicit polynomial equation derived for the corresponding green function in @xcite .",
    "we saw that the macroscopic level density either lives on an annulus or a complex disc centered around the origin , which is in agreement with the single ring theorem  @xcite .",
    "after proper unfolding , universality should hold on a local scale as have been partially discussed in  @xcite .    finally , we briefly discussed the relation between matrix products and a closed one - dimensional chaotic chain in an environment .",
    "in particular , we calculate the lyapunov exponents .",
    "we concluded that the ordering of the potential wells is irrelevant as long as we do not consider cross correlations , which directly follows from the weak commutation relation .",
