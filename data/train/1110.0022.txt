    "<S> the usual description of self - induced flavor conversions for neutrinos ( @xmath0 s ) in supernovae is based on the simplified assumption that all the @xmath0 s of the different species are emitted `` half - isotropically '' by a common neutrinosphere , in analogy to a blackbody emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , realistic supernova simulations show that @xmath0 angular distributions at decoupling are far from being half - isotropic and , above all , are flavor - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we show that flavor - dependent angular distributions may lead to crossing points in the angular spectra of different @xmath0 species ( where @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) around which a new multi - angle instability can develop . to characterize this effect , </S>",

    "<S> introduction. _ the neutrino flux emitted from a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) represents a powerful tool to get valuable information about the mixing parameters and the dynamics of the exploding stellar core . in this context , renewed attention is being paid to collective features of flavor transformations  @xcite induced by @xmath0-@xmath0 self - interactions  @xcite in the deepest sn regions , near the neutrino - sphere ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . in particular , it has been claimed that the self - induced `` spectral splits '' would be observable in the @xmath0 burst from the next galactic sn , allowing to get crucial information about the unknown @xmath0 mass ordering ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of these self - induced effects crucially depends on the inner boundary conditions fixed for the flavor evolution , e.g. on the @xmath0 initial energy and angular distributions . in this context , all the recent numerical simulations have been based on the so - called `` bulb model '' ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) . assuming that the @xmath0 trapping region at high matter density can be decoupled from the region at lower density where flavor conversions would start , @xmath0 s of different species </S>",
    "<S> are considered as emitted `` half - isotropically '' ( i.e. with all outward - moving angular modes equally occupied and all the backward - moving modes empty ) by a common spherical `` neutrinosphere , '' in analogy with a blackbody emission . however </S>",
    "<S> , this simplified toy - model may not capture important features of the sn @xmath0 emission . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the transition between the isotropic @xmath0 emission in trapping regime ( at a higher matter density ) to the forward - peaked free streaming ( at a lower matter density ) does not necessarily imply a radius where the @xmath0 angular distributions are half - isotropic ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the different @xmath0 species decouple at different radii . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the physical last - scattering neutrinospheres for the different species would not coincide . then , fixing a common neutrinosphere as inner boundary for the flavor evolution , one would realistically find there different angular distributions for the different @xmath0 species . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , since the @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s decouple at smaller radii with respect to @xmath5 s their distributions are more forward - peaked .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of non - trivial angular distributions was claimed in  @xcite to produce a multi - angle instability in the self - induced flavor evolution of a toy model of @xmath0 gas . </S>",
    "<S> however , in that seminal paper the author warned readers not to draw firm conclusions for the realistic sn @xmath0 case from his analysis performed with a small number of angular modes , before having explored this case with large - scale numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> stimulated also by his intriguing hint , we decided to begin a systematic study of this issue . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as long as flavor universality is not broken in the @xmath0 angular distributions , only minor quantitative effects appear in the evolution with respect to the half - isotropic case . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , flavor - dependent angular distributions can dramatically affect the conversions of the dense sn @xmath0 gas . </S>",
    "<S> we relate this behavior to the presence of crossing points in the angular spectra of different @xmath0 species ( i.e. , at emission angles for which @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that @xmath0 energy spectra presenting crossing points in the energy variable can develop instabilities around them  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been analytically understood performing a linearized stability analysis of the @xmath0 equations of motion  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , applying the same analysis , we find that an analogous effect occurs when the angular spectra of different flavors present crossing points . as a consequence , </S>",

    "<S> energy spectra initially for @xmath5 ( black continuous curves ) and @xmath4 ( light continuous curves ) and after collective oscillations for @xmath5 with half - isotropic angular distribution ( dashed curves ) and for an angular distribution with @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( thick dotted curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> lower panels : difference of the energy - integrated angular spectra @xmath9 for @xmath0 s ( left panel ) and @xmath6 s ( right panel ) at the neutrinosphere for the half - isotropic case @xmath10 ( dashed curves ) and for the cases with @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( dotted curves ) , @xmath7 , @xmath11 ( continuous curves ) and @xmath12 ( dash - dotted curves ) . [ fig1 ] ]    _ energy and angular distributions. _ in order to perform our study of the multi - angle instability we have to fix our @xmath0 emission models . </S>",
    "<S> our main goal would be to remove the bulb - model approximation of a half - isotropic neutrino angular distribution at the neutrinosphere , equal for all the species . in order to introduce @xmath0 angular distributions </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to parameterize every angular mode in terms of its emission angle @xmath13 relative to the radial direction of the neutrinosphere , that here we schematically fix at @xmath14  km . </S>",
    "<S> a further simplification is obtained if one labels the different angular modes in terms of the variable @xmath15 , as in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that for an half - isotropic emission at the neutrinosphere the @xmath0 angular distribution of the radial fluxes is a box spectrum in @xmath16  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that energy and angular distributions of sn @xmath0 s entering the @xmath0 number fluxes @xmath17 , integrated over a sphere of radius @xmath18 , are not independent of each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , here we schematically assume that the angular distributions are energy independent . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can factorize the @xmath0 flux of each flavor as @xmath19 the function @xmath20 is the normalized @xmath0 energy spectrum ( @xmath21 ) , which we will parametrize for the different flavors with deformed maxwell - boltzmann distributions , as suggested by sn simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath22 is the normalized angular distribution ( @xmath23=1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the neutrino average energies at @xmath24 . concerning the possible @xmath0 flux ordering we </S>",
    "<S> consider a case representative of the cooling phase  @xcite , i.e. @xmath25 . according to this choice , in the upper panels of figure  1 are represented the initial fluxes for @xmath5 ( continuous black curves ) and @xmath4 ( continuous light curves ) for @xmath0 s ( left panels ) and @xmath26 s ( right panels ) respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> a systematic characterization of the @xmath0 angular distributions at different radii in sne is lacking in literature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , inspired by an inspection of some real angular distributions  @xcite , we use a simple toy model to capture the main deviations with respect to the half - isotropic bulb model , where @xmath27 for all the @xmath0 species . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we choose forward - peaked distributions @xmath28 . for simplicity in the following </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> in the lower panels of figure  1 we plot the energy - integrated spectral difference @xmath30 for @xmath0 s ( left panels ) and the analogous one for @xmath6 s ( right panels ) for four representative @xmath31 cases . </S>",
    "<S> namely we compare the half - isotropic case ( @xmath32 , dashed curves ) with three non - trivial angular distributions : @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( dotted curves ) , @xmath7 , @xmath11 ( continuous curves ) , and @xmath12 ( dash - dotted curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> one realizes that in the half - isotropic case @xmath10 and in the flavor universal case @xmath12 , the differences of angular spectra do not present any crossing point in the angular variable , while in the other two cases , the spectra present a crossing point at finite @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that crossing points in the energy - integrated angular spectra will produce a significant speed - up of the multi - angle instability in the @xmath0 flavor conversions .    </S>",
    "<S> _ setup of the flavor evolution. _ our description of the non - linear @xmath0 flavor conversions is based on a two - flavor oscillation scenario . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we refer to the cases studied in  @xcite in which three - flavor effects associated with the solar sector are sub - leading . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , self - induced oscillations are driven by the atmospheric mass - square difference @xmath35  ev@xmath36 and by a small ( matter suppressed ) in - medium mixing @xmath37  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to late - time cooling phase ( @xmath38  s ) where the electron density @xmath39 is smaller than the @xmath0 one @xmath40 and then has a subleading role on the development of the collective oscillations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the mixing suppression , we neglect the sub - leading matter effects in the flavor evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to the inverted mass hierarchy ( @xmath41 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> following  @xcite , we write the equations of motion for the flux matrices @xmath42 as function of the radial coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal @xmath42 elements are the ordinary number fluxes @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we normalize the flux matrices to the total @xmath3 number flux @xmath44 at the neutrinosphere . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally , we use negative @xmath45 and negative number fluxes for @xmath26 s . </S>",
    "<S> the off - diagonal elements , which are initially zero , carry a phase information due to flavor mixing . </S>",

    "<S> one needs to follow a large number @xmath49 $ ] of interacting @xmath0 modes .    _ </S>",
    "<S> stability condition. _ in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the multi - angle instability , triggered by non - trivial angular distributions , we find particularly useful to apply to our problem the linearized stability analysis recently worked out in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows us to determine the onset of the flavor conversions , seeking an exponentially growing solution in the eigenvalue equations , associated with the linearized equations of motion for the @xmath0 ensemble . in order to perform the stability analysis </S>",
    "<S> we closely follow the prescriptions presented in  @xcite and summarized in the following . at </S>",
    "<S> first we switch to the frequency variable @xmath50 and we introduce the neutrino flux difference distributions latexmath:[$g_{\\omega , u}\\equiv g(\\omega , u ) =    normalized to the total @xmath3 flux at the neutrinosphere . note that @xmath52 is defined also for negative @xmath53 , where it represents the difference of fluxes in the antineutrino sector in the opposite ordering . </S>",
    "<S> then , we write the flux matrices as  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is conserved and then irrelevant for the flavor conversions , and the initial conditions for the `` swapping matrix '' in the second term on the right - hand side are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . self - induced flavor transitions start when the off - diagonal term @xmath58 exponentially grows . in the small - amplitude limit @xmath59 , and at far distances from the neutrinosphere @xmath60 , the linearized evolution equations for @xmath58 lead to an eigenvalue equation  @xcite @xmath61 for the eigenvector @xmath62 , obtained writing the solution of the linearized equation @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> here we introduced the complex frequency @xmath64 and the parameter @xmath65 quantifying the `` asymmetry '' of the neutrino spectrum , normalized to the total @xmath3 number flux . for our specific choice of @xmath0 spectra </S>",
    "<S> , it results @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction strength is given by @xmath67 for our sn model , it results @xmath68  km@xmath69 . a solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eigen ] ) with @xmath70 would indicate an exponential increasing @xmath62 , i.e. an instability . </S>",
    "<S> when an instability occurs , for a given angular mode @xmath71 the function @xmath72 is a lorentzian  @xcite , centered around a _ resonance frequency _ @xmath73 and with a width @xmath74 .    _ flavor conversions </S>",
    "<S> _ in order to illustrate the effect of the angular distributions , in fig .  1 ( upper panels ) we compare the oscillated electron ( anti)neutrino fluxes ( at @xmath75  km ) in the half - isotropic case ( @xmath32 ; dashed curve ) with a non - trivial angular distribution with @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( thick dotted curve ) . the effect on the final spectra is dramatic : the spectral splits observable in the final @xmath76 spectra in the half - isotropic case are smeared - out and the spectral swaps are not complete .     for @xmath0 s for the half - isotropic case ( dashed curve ) and for angular distributions with @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( dotted curve ) , @xmath7 , @xmath11 ( continuous curve ) , and @xmath12 ( dot - dashed curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> lower - panel : radial evolution of the eigenvalue @xmath74 for the same cases shown in the upper panel . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ]    in the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we show the radial evolution of the z - component of the integrated value of the @xmath0 polarization vector @xmath77 , that is related to the flavor content of the ensemble for four different angular distributions of fig .  [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we compare the half - isotropic case ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , dashed curve ) with three non - trivial angular distributions : @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( dotted curve ) , @xmath7 , @xmath11 ( continuous curve ) , and @xmath12 ( dot - dashed curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , note that with the @xmath12 flavor - blind distributions the behavior does not present major changes with respect to the naive case , except from a delay in the starting of flavor conversions at @xmath80  km . in the case of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the onset of the flavor conversions ( at @xmath81 km ) is very close to what expected in the half - isotropic case ( @xmath82 km ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the further flavor evolution shows dramatic differences . indeed , with the non - trivial angular distribution the final value of the integrated @xmath0 polarization vector would be @xmath83 indicating that the spectral differences between the final @xmath5 and @xmath4 spectra are strongly reduced with respect to the half - isotropic case . </S>",
    "<S> choosing larger differences in the angular distributions of different flavors , as in the case with @xmath7 , @xmath11 , not only the final value of the @xmath77 will change , but also flavor conversions would start much earlier ( @xmath84 km ) than in the half - isotropic case .    in the bottom panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we plot the radial evolution of the eigenvalue @xmath74 coming from the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eigen ] ) for the same cases shown in the upper panel . in the half - isotropic case @xmath32 ( dashed curve ) </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath74 function presents a hump peaked around @xmath85  km and connected with a long tail around @xmath86  km . </S>",
    "<S> this tail indicates that the system is in principle always unstable . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can verify that in the tail the unstable @xmath0 frequency modes are in the infrared region , where the spectrum is strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they have no impact for the flavor conversions . the onset of the flavor conversions is then given by the connection between the hump and the tail at @xmath87  km . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with what shown in the numerical calculation of @xmath77 , shown in the upper panel ( dashed curve ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when considering non - trivial angular distributions , the long tail in the @xmath74 function in the half - isotropic case now disappears . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of a non - isotropic angular distribution is not enough to produce an enhancement in the value of @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in the flavor blind case @xmath12 ( dot - dashed curve ) the instability is suppressed with respect to what has been seen in the half - isotropic case . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> flavor conversions start at @xmath88  km . </S>",
    "<S> a significant enhancement of the multi - angle instability occurs when @xmath0 angular spectra exhibit crossing points in @xmath89 , as can be seen in the case with @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( dotted curve ) and even more in the one with @xmath7 , @xmath11 ( continuous curve ) . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the peak in @xmath74 increases with respect to the half - isotropic case and also the hump broadens toward smaller @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath74 reaches a higher peak value , the width of the lorentzian around an unstable frequency mode for a given angle @xmath89 would be broad , implying a speed - up in the transitions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of @xmath90 flavor conversions start at @xmath81  km , while in the case with @xmath91 around @xmath84  km , in agreement with the numerical results shown in the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions _ we have described a new instability in self - induced flavor conversions for sn @xmath0 s , associated with flavor - dependent angular distributions . </S>",
    "<S> these can lead to crossing points among the different spectra that can produce new flavor conversion effects , absent with an half - isotropic @xmath0 emission . </S>",
    "<S> we checked that this effect would develop in both the mass hierarchies and would be particularly relevant during the sn cooling phase , where the differences among the different flavors are relatively small , and self - induced effect can develop without any matter hindrance . the effect on the oscillated @xmath0 spectra can be dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it would produce a smearing of the splitting features widely discussed in the half - isotropic case , and resulting @xmath0 fluxes with less significant spectral differences . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency toward spectral equalization would challenge the detection of further oscillation signatures , like the ones associated with the earth crossing of sn @xmath0 s ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that also onset of the flavor conversions can be significantly pushed at low - radii , challenging the multi - angle suppression found in the half - isotropic case  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible flavor conversions at low - radii would have an interesting impact on the r - process nucleosynthesis in sne  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if @xmath0 oscillations develop too close to the neutrinosphere , they would invalidate the @xmath0 transport paradigm in sne that ignores @xmath0 conversions . </S>",
    "<S> given the importance of the effects discussed here , a future task would be to perform the flavor evolution and stability analysis taking into account angular distributions as realistic as possible , obtained directly from sn simulations . </S>"
