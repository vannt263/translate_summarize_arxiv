    "we start this review with the microscopic maxwell equations , @xmath0 here * e * and * b * are the microscopic electric and magnetic fields respectively .",

    "note that these equations are written in the c.g.s .",
    "system of units . to convert them to s.i .",
    "units , simply replace @xmath3 by @xmath4 .",
    "the charge distribution for a collection of point sources with charge @xmath5 can be written classically , @xmath6 or quantum mechanically as , @xmath7 equations ( [ micromax1]-[micromax4 ] ) are not very practical to work with . as a first step we rewrite them in a more familiar form . to do this we average the fields , charge and current distributions over a volume @xmath8 , @xmath9 and similarly for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is a sensible procedure under the condition that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bohr radius . using these averaged distributions we arrive at the standard maxwell equations in free space , @xmath14 in order to see",
    "how matter interacts with propagating electromagnetic waves we have to distinguish between induced and external sources .",
    "we write @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "both the induced and external charge and current distributions have to obey the continuity equations separately , @xmath17 we can distinguish three different types of macroscopic internal sources , @xmath18 the first term on the right hand side , @xmath19 , corresponds to the response of the free charges .",
    "the second term is the current due to changes in the polarization state of the system .",
    "finally , we include a term representing a current due to magnetization .",
    "note that this last term is purely transversal ( the divergence of a rotation is always zero ) and so is easy to distinguish from the other two terms .",
    "since the induced free charge current due to photons is necessarily transversal , @xmath20 , we can use the continuity equations to show that the induced free charge density has to be zero and as a consequence that the total induced charge density @xmath21 it is convenient to introduce new fields @xmath22 so that using equations ( [ jind]-[hfield ] ) in equations ( [ max1 ] ) and ( [ max4 ] ) we find , @xmath23      in the spirit of linear response theory we assume that the response of polarization , magnetization or current are linear in the applied fields : @xmath24 the electric and magnetic susceptibilities can be expressed in terms of a dielectric function @xmath25 and magnetic permittivity @xmath26 .",
    "the dielectric function is a response function that connects the external field @xmath27 at position * r * and time @xmath28 with the field @xmath29 at all other times and positions .",
    "so in general , @xmath30 we will be mainly interested in the fourier transform of @xmath31 however .",
    "it is an easy exercise to express the maxwell equations in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 which we leave to the reader .",
    "we can use these definitions to once again rewrite the maxwell equations in the following form , @xmath34 we are now in a position to study the response of a solid to an externally applied field or light wave . for simplicity",
    "we assume that our solid is homogeneous so that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we can describe light waves by plane waves , i.e. @xmath37 using ( [ b ] ) on the right hand side of faraday s equation ( [ max2 ] ) and rearranging we find , @xmath38 if we now take the curl of this equation and use the fact that we can express @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 as ( see equations ( [ hfield ] ) and ( [ mag ] ) ) , @xmath41 we find that @xmath42 note that in this equation we are left with only the transversal field since the curl of a curl is transverse .",
    "we give two further identities for completeness , @xmath43 and , @xmath44 finally , we note that inside the solid @xmath45 . with this",
    "we have all the ingredients to express equation ( [ mattermax4 ] ) in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath46 .",
    "we split this equation in transversal and longitudinal parts to find , @xmath47 we can define a new dielectric function with longitudinal and transverse components and write the previous equation in a more compact form , @xmath48 this new dielectric function @xmath49 is now a complex quantity : @xmath50 . using the last relation we can also define a complex conductivity @xmath51 and it is related to the dielectric function by ,",
    "@xmath52 the real part of @xmath49 is often called the reactive part and the imaginary part the dissipative part .",
    "the real and imaginary parts are also indicated with a subscript 1 and 2 instead of (  ) and (  ) .",
    "a fundamental principle in physics is the principle of causality : an effect can not precede its cause .",
    "this principle provides us with a very useful relation between the real and imaginary parts of a response function like the optical conductivity as we now show .",
    "first we express the induced current due to an electric field in terms of a memory function , @xmath53 the memory function has the property that @xmath54 .",
    "this is simply a restatement of the causality principle : we switch on a driving force at time @xmath55 so before that time there can be no current .",

    "we discuss the properties of electromagnetic waves propagating through solids .",
    "such a wave is called a polariton .",
    "a polariton is a photon dressed up with the excitations that exist inside solids . for example one can have phonon - polaritons which are photons dressed up with phonons .",
    "although the solutions of the maxwell equations , i.e. the fields @xmath29 and @xmath40 , have the same form as before ( eq . ( [ e ] ) and ( [ b ] ) )",

    "[ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < \" , ]     the sum rule for band electrons is in practice the most useful .",
    "suppose that we have a system with only a single reasonably well isolated band around the fermi level that can be approximated by a tight binding dispersion @xmath90 .",
    "in that case we find an interesting relation , @xmath91 this sum rule states that by measuring the optical spectral weight we are in fact measuring the kinetic energy of the charge carriers contributing to the optical conductivity .",
    "in real systems this relation only holds approximately : usually there are other bands lying nearby and the integral on the left contains contributions from these as well",
    ". often the bands are described by more complicated dispersion relations in which case the relation @xmath92 does not hold .",
    "we can make some other observations from the sum rule for band electrons .",
    "suppose again we have a single empty cosine like band ( it is only necessary that the band is symmetric but it simplifies the discussion ) at @xmath93 .",
    "since the band is empty , the spectral weight is equal to zero .",
    "if we start adding electrons the spectral weight starts to increase until we reach half - filling . if we add more electrons the spectral weight will start to decrease again because the second derivative becomes negative for @xmath94 .",
    "if we completely fill the band the contributions from @xmath94 will precisely cancel the contributions from @xmath95 and the spectral weight is again zero .",
    "now consider what happens if we have a half - filled band and start to increase the temperature . due to the smearing of the fermi - dirac distribution higher energy states will get occupied leaving behind lower energy empty states .",
    "the result of this is that the spectral weight starts to decrease .",
    "one can show using the summerfeld expansion that the spectral weight follows a @xmath96 temperature dependence . in the extreme limit of @xmath97",
    "something remarkable happens : the fermi - dirac distribution is 1/2 everywhere and the electrons are equally spread out over the band .",
    "the metal has become an insulator !",
    "before we have a look at some applications of sum rules to superconductors we first summarize some results from bcs theory .",
    "we want to apply our ideas to cuprate superconductors so we use a modified version from the original theory to include the possibility of d - wave superconductivity . in other words",
    "we suppose that there is some attractive interaction between the electrons that has a momentum dependence .",
    "the energy difference between the normal and superconducting state due to interactions can be written as @xcite , @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the pair correlation function and its fourier transform respectively .",

    "although @xmath100 is not so illuminating @xmath99 is .",
    "this function is zero at the origin and strongly peaked at the nearest neighbor sites .",

    "we also note that the correlation function drops off very fast for sites removed further from the origin .     correlation energy and kinetic energy as a function of temperature for a d - wave bcs superconductor .",
    "figure adapted from @xcite.,width=8 ]    in figure [ correnergy ] we show the results for a calculation of the correlation and kinetic energy using the parameters extracted from arpes measurements on bi-2212 .",
    "the kinetic energy is calculated from , @xmath105 we see that the kinetic energy _ increases _ in the superconducting state .",
    "this can be easily understood by looking at what happens to the particle distribution function below @xmath106 , as indicated in the left panel of figure [ distribution ] : when the system enters the superconducting state the area below the fermi energy decreases and the area above the fermi energy increases thereby increasing the total kinetic energy of the system .",
    "left : distribution function for the normal ( fermi liquid like ) state and the superconducting state .",
    "right : distribution function for a non - fermi liquid like state and the superconducting state.,width=8 ]    nevertheless the total internal energy , which is the sum of the interaction energy and the kinetic energy , decreases and this is of course why the system becomes superconducting .",
    "now let us take a look at what happens in the cuprates .",
    "in figure [ wbi2223 ] we display the optical spectral weight @xmath107 as a function of @xmath96 for bi-2223 .",
    "temperature dependent spectral weight of bi-2223 .",
    "data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=6 ]    to compare this to the bcs kinetic energy we have plotted here @xmath108 .",
    "this result is contrary to the result from our calculation : the kinetic energy decreases in the superconducting state .",
    "this experimental result , observed first by molegraaf _",
    "@xcite , has sparked a lot of interest both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "we note that dmft calculations with the hubbard model as starting point have shown the same effect as observed here @xcite . roughly speaking the effect",
    "is believed to be due to the `` strangeness '' of the normal state ( right panel figure [ distribution ] ) .",
    "it is well known that the normal state of the cuprates shows non fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "so if the distribution function in the normal state does not show the characteristic step of the fermi liquid at the fermi energy but is rather a broadened function of momentum it is very well possible that the argument we made for the increase of the kinetic energy ( see above ) is reversed .",
    "another interesting application of sum rules is that we can use them in some cases to extract the hopping parameters of a system . in order to see how this works we express the optical conductivity at zero temperature , @xmath109 in terms of the dipole operator . here",
    "@xmath110 is the groundstate of the system . to do this",
    "we make use of the commutator eq .",
    "( [ commutator ] ) and the insertion of a complete set of states . after integrating over frequency",
    "we get @xmath111 we note that this can be done only for finite system sizes . now consider the special case of a diatomic molecule with two energy levels , one on each atom and a hopping parameter t and distance @xmath112 between the two atoms .",
    "we also assume that there is a splitting @xmath113 between the two levels .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system is , @xmath114 the indices @xmath115 and @xmath116 indicate the left and right atom respectively .",

    "data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=8 ]    we see that there is a very simple relation between the spectral weight of this model and the hopping parameter .",
    "this sumrule has been applied to @xmath126-nav@xmath127o@xmath128 @xcite .",
    "this compound is a so - called ladder compound .",
    "it consists of double chains of vanadium atoms forming ladders which are weakly coupled to each other .",
    "each unit cell contains 4 v atoms and 2 valence electrons .",
    "the vanadiums on the rungs of the ladder are more strongly coupled than those along the legs , i.e. @xmath129 . the heitler - london model we have discussed above can be applied to this system since each rung forms precisely a two level system with different levels .",
    "the only difference that we have to take into account is that this is a crystal consisting of @xmath130 independent two level systems .",
    "figure [ navo ] shows the optical conductivity of @xmath126-nav@xmath127o@xmath128 .",
    "there are two measurements shown : one with light polarized parallel to the chains and one with light polarized perpendicular to the chains .",
    "we can immediately read of @xmath131 ev . integrating the contribution to the optical conductivity of the peaks we find that the spectral weight perpendicular to the chains is roughly 4 times larger then the spectral weight parallel to the chains , so @xmath132 .",
    "inverting eq .",
    "( [ tsum ] ) we can calculate @xmath133 and we find @xmath134 ev . the second strong peak at approximately 3.2 ev is a charge transfer peak from vanadium to oxygen .",
    "we will come back to this example in the last section on spin interactions .",
    "we have already encountered the drude formula for the optical conductivity of a metal ( see the section on polaritons ) . even though this model is based on a classical gas of non - interacting particles",
    "it describes amazingly well the optical properties of a good metal .",
    "this is even more surprising if one realizes that in a metal electrons reside in bands and that the transitions we are making with photons are vertical due to the negligible photon momentum .",
    "so from the band picture point of view , when we consider a single band of electrons interacting with photons we should expect a single delta function at the origin .",
    "the reason that this is not what is observed is because we have neglected the other interactions in the system .",
    "electrons in solids interact with the lattice vibrations , impurities and/or other collective modes . due to the electron - phonon interaction for instance",
    "we can have processes where a photon creates an electron - hole pair in which the electron `` shakes off '' a phonon . in this process",
    "the phonon can carry away a much larger momentum then originally provided by the photon . due to this effect",
    "we can have phonon - assisted transitions which give a width @xmath135 to the delta function .",
    "this width is called the scattering rate . if the interactions are inelastic , as in the interactions with impurities , this scattering rate is just a constant .",
    "otherwise , this scattering rate can depend on frequency .",
    "however , if we define the scattering rate in eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) to be frequency dependent , @xmath136 , the kk - relations force us to introduce a frequency dependent effective mass as well .",
    "this is what is done in the generalized drude formalism @xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity is written as , @xmath137 having measured a conductivity spectrum we can invert these equations to calculate 1/@xmath138 or @xmath139 via , @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the last equality of these equations we have defined an optical self - energy .",
    "note that this quantity is _ not _ equivalent to the self - energy used in the context of green s functions .",
    "we can rewrite the optical conductivity in terms of @xmath142 as , @xmath143 in the case of impurity scattering @xmath142 is simply given by @xmath144     optical conductivity of ce in the @xmath126 and @xmath145 phases .",

    "we can also capture the effect of the interaction of the electrons with the static lattice potential in a self - energy , @xmath148 which gives @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "this is also called static mass renormalization .",
    "finally we consider dynamical mass renormalization where the electrons couple to a spectrum of bosons , @xmath151 here @xmath89 is a coupling constant and @xmath152 is a characteristic temperature scale related to the bosons . in this case",
    "we find , @xmath153 and @xmath154    as an example we will discuss the @xmath126-phase to @xmath145-phase transition in pure cerium .",

    "because of the inevitable noise in the data usually some form of smoothing is required .",
    "applied to zrb@xmath166 the extracted @xmath172 shows peaks at the same positions as the ones extracted before and a coupling strength @xmath180 .",
    "these results indicate a medium to strong electron - phonon coupling for zrb@xmath166 .",
    "there exist many definitions of what is a polaron .",
    "electrons coupled to a phonon have been called polaron as have free electrons moving around in an insulator . here",
    "we will consider the landau - pekar approximation for a polaron @xcite .",
    "the idea is that when an electron moves about the crystal it polarizes the surrounding lattice and this in turn leads to an attractive potential for the electron . if the interaction between electron and lattice is sufficiently strong this potential is capable of trapping the electron and it becomes more or less localized .",
    "the new object , electron plus polarization cloud is called polaron .",
    "this self - trapping of electrons can occur in a number of different situations and different names are used .",
    "for instance , one talks about small polarons in models where only short range interactions are considered , because this typically leads to polaron formation with polarons occupying a single lattice site . from the landau - pekar formalism",
    "we can get some feeling of when polarons form and what their     schematic of the optical conductivity of electrons interacting with a single einstein mode.,width=6 ]    properties will be .",
    "first of all , the coupling constant @xmath126 is given by , @xmath181 where @xmath182 stands for the unit rydberg ( 1 rydberg = @xmath183 = 13.6 ev ) , @xmath184 is the oscillator frequency of the ( einstein ) phonon mode involved @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the band and free electron mass respectively and @xmath187 is given by , @xmath188 for strong coupling ( small polarons ) the polaron mass is expressed in terms of the coupling constant as , @xmath189     doping dependence of the room temperature optical conductivity of la@xmath190sr@xmath191cuo@xmath192 .",
    "figure adapted from uchida _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "@xcite.,width=6 ]    with the polaron binding energy given by , @xmath193 the polaron binding energy typically is of the order of a few 100 mev .",
    "the polaron mass is typically of the order of 50 - 100 times the electron mass .",
    "the effect of polaron formation on the optical conductivity can be described by assuming a gas of non - interacting polarons ( i.e. low polaron density ) .",
    "this results in a spectrum that can be described by a drude peak and a so - called holstein side - band .",
    "if we assume that the electrons interact with a single einstein mode the spectrum will look as in figure [ polcond ] .",
    "the spectrum consists of a zero - phonon , coherent part ( n = 0 ) with a spectral weight 1/(1 + 0.02@xmath194 ) followed by a series of peaks that describe the incoherent movement of polarons assisted by n=1,2,3 .. phonons . in real solids",
    "the peaks are smeared out due to the fact that phonons form bands .",
    "the real part of the optical conductivity can thus be described as , @xmath195 the first term in this expression describes the coherent part of the spectrum , which in real solids will also be smeared out to finite frequency by other forms of scattering , and an incoherent term given by the second term which is called the holstein band .",
    "the shape of the side - band can be qualitatively understood by imagining how a polaron has to move through the lattice . in order to move from one site to another the lattice deformation around the original site",
    "has to relax and be adjusted on the new site .",
    "this relaxation process results in the multi - phonon side - bands of the drude peak .     left panel : temperature dependent resistivity of latio@xmath196 .",

    "@xcite.,width=8 ]    the observation of the holstein side - band is somewhat complicated because it is not possible to distinguish between normal interband transitions and the effects due to polaron formation .",
    "there have been some claims that a band observed in the mid infrared region ( @xmath197 100 - 500 mev ) of the spectrum of high - t@xmath198 superconductors is due to polaron formation but many other interpretations exist .",
    "figure [ lscodopdep ] shows the doping dependence of la@xmath190sr@xmath191cuo@xmath192 .",
    "the peak that occurs around 0.5 ev for the 0.02 doped sample has been interpreted as the holstein side - band .",
    "another example where polarons could play a role is in latio@xmath196 @xcite . in this material",
    "the resistivity ( figure [ latio ] ) shows a quasi one dimensional behavior with an upturn of the resistivity at lower temperatures .",
    "this could be due to polaron formation but it has also been interpreted as due to a charge density wave .",
    "the optical conductivity at low temperatures shows that a large part of the spectral weight is contained in a side - band around 300 mev ( see figure [ latio ] ) .",
    "if this peak would be due to polarons we expect that when we warm up the system to higher temperatures its spectral weight should be diminished .",
    "this is because the increased temperature unbinds electrons from their self - trapping potential and therefore shifts spectral weight from the holstein band to the drude peak .",
    "this is also what is observed and at the same time explains the decrease of resistivity with increasing temperature .",
    "crystal structure of nav@xmath199o@xmath200.,width=6 ]    the last example we will discuss is nav@xmath199o@xmath200 .",
    "the structure of this compound is build up out off octahedra and tetrahedra of vanadium and oxygen atoms where the tetrahedra form quasi 1-dimensional zig - zag chains ( see figure [ navostruct ] ) .",
    "there are 3 different types of vanadium sites in this structure : 2 of them are ionic with a charge 5 + on the vanadium which has then a @xmath201 configuration .",
    "the third site has half an electron more leading to a charge of 4.5 + on the vanadium atom in a @xmath202 configuration .",
    "because of this we expect a quarter filled band and metallic behavior .",
    "figure [ navosigma ] shows the optical conductivity of @xmath203- nav@xmath199o@xmath200 .",
    "the chains are along the direction labelled _ b_. at energies around 3000 @xmath204 we observe a broad peak for light polarized along the @xmath205-direction which could be due to polarons although these transitions also correspond well with the energies predicted by the hubbard model for d - d transitions . if we compare the conductivity with polarization parallel and perpendicular to the b - axis , we see that the conductivity perpendicular to the b - axis is insulating whereas the one along the b - axis is conducting .",
    "this conducting behavior is due to the quarter filled bands",
    ".    optical conductivity of @xmath203-nav@xmath199o@xmath200 for light polarized along and perpendicular to the b - axis .",
    "figure adapted from @xcite , width=6 ]    are polarons playing an important role in the above examples ?",
    "it is nearly impossible to answer this question experimentally due to the above mentioned difficulty in separating polaronic behavior from normal interband transitions . moreover , in most cases where polarons are invoked , other theories are also able to reproduce the experimental results . to close this section we briefly discuss what happens if the density of polarons becomes larger .",
    "imagine what happens if we increase the density of polarons such that we are getting close to a system with one polaron on each site .",
    "in that case the original lattice will almost be completely deformed and one can wonder wether the electrons are still capable to self - trap .",
    "it seems reasonable that in this limit the polaron picture no longer applies .",
    "another possibility is the formation of bipolarons .",
    "since the deformation energy of the lattice is proportional to the electron charge @xmath206 , the binding energy of two polarons is @xmath207 .",
    "the binding energy of a bipolaron ( two electrons trapped by the same polarization cloud ) is twice as large however @xmath208 .",
    "this binding energy is usually not enough to overcome the coulomb repulsion between the electrons .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section the signatures for the presence of polarons can often be interpreted with different ideas .",
    "most often these models are based on coupling to magnetic interactions .",
    "consider for example the spectrum of the parent ( undoped ) compound yba@xmath127cu@xmath209o@xmath199 which is a mott insulator ( see bottom panel of figure [ reftrans ] ) .",
    "below 100 mev we see a series of peaks which are due to phonons .",
    "but what about the structure between 100 mev and 1 ev",
    "? one of the difficulties in explaining this structure is that light does not directly couple to spin degrees of freedom .",
    "it is however possible to indirectly make spin flips with photons ( see figure [ spinflip ] ) .",
    "for this process to occur we have to include phonon - magnon interaction .",
    "when a photon enters the material it gets dressed with phonons forming a polariton which is then coupled to the spin degrees by the phonon - magnon interaction .",
    "this leads to the possibility of so - called phonon assisted absorption of spin - flip excitations @xcite .",
    "we see from figure [ spinflip ] that the polariton creates a bi - magnon .",
    "this is because the intermediate state has to have spin s = 0 .",
    "the dashed square represents all magnon - magnon interactions .",
    "the coupling constant for this process was first calculated by lorenzana and sawatzky and is @xmath210      where @xmath211 is the superexchange constant and @xmath118 is the atomic displacement vector . in the process momentum and energy",
    "have to be conserved and this leads to @xmath212 and @xmath213 for the process in figure [ spinflip ] .",
    "this gives constraints on the possible absorptions . in figure [ spinsigma ]",
    "some examples are shown of materials in which we believe this process to play a role .",
    "one of the compounds where the predicted optical conductivity fits the spectrum very well is in the case of sr@xmath127cuo@xmath209 . to make the fit the magnon dispersion as measured with neutron scattering",
    "the reason that this theory works so well for sr@xmath127cuo@xmath209 is that the conduction is nearly one dimensional .",
    "this gives a good starting point because the magnon spectrum is completely understood . on the contrary , the theory is not completely capable of predicting the spectrum of la@xmath127cuo@xmath192 .",
    "most likely the peaks around 0.6 and 0.75 ev are due to 4 and 6 magnon absorption . in the case of yba@xmath127cu@xmath209o@xmath199",
    "the situation gets even more complicated due to the presence of two layers per unit cell .",
    "because of the doubling of the unit cell , there are now acoustic and optical magnon branches just as what would happen in the case of phonons .",
    "the effect of this on the optical conductivity was first discussed by grueninger _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "another example of probing of spin excitations occurs in nav@xmath127o@xmath128 .",
    "as already discussed in the previous section this compound has quasi one dimensional chains as shown in figure [ navostruct ] .",
    "these chains can be seen to form a so - called ladder structure , with the ladders parallel to the @xmath205 direction .",
    "each adjacent ladder is shifted with respect to the previous such that the rungs of one ladder fall in between those of the next ( figure [ navolad ] ) .",
    "the vanadium atoms that form the ladders have an average charge of + 4.5 .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that the charge distribution is inhomogeneous with most of the charge on one side of the ladder as indicated in figure [ navolad ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility can be modelled pretty well using a bonner - fischer model for a spin-1/2 heisenberg chain @xcite for temperatures higher then 34 k ( see figure [ navomag ] ) . below 34 k , x - ray analysis shows a doubling of the a- and b- axes and a quadrupling of the c - axis .",
    "it indicates that the new unit cell consists of 64 vanadium atoms and 32 valence electrons . at the same temperature the susceptibility shows an abrupt drop .",
    "an explanation for this transition is in terms of a spin - peierls transition . in the high temperature phase ( t @xmath214 t@xmath215 )",
    "the left side of the ladder has a uniform spin distribution , as indicated in the left panel of figure [ navophase ] , which is reasonably well described with an anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) s = 1/2 heisenberg spin chain with uniform exchange coupling @xmath211 . for t @xmath216 t@xmath215 the system dimerises due to a deformation of the lattice , leading to an alternation of exchange couplings ( see right panel figure [ navophase ] ) . here",
    "we focus on the high temperature phase .",
    "if the charge inhomogeneity is present it would lead to a breaking of the inversion symmetry which in turn leads to a non - zero optical matrix element for two magnon absorption @xcite .",
    "the idea is similar to the lorenzana - sawatzky model discussed above . in the latter case",
    "the phonon effectively lowers the symmetry making the process optically allowed .",
    "the optical conductivity of @xmath126- nav@xmath127o@xmath128 is shown in figure [ alphanavo ] .",
    "we can model @xmath126- nav@xmath127o@xmath128 with independent ladders where the hopping probability along a rung ( @xmath133 ) is much larger than that along the ladder ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "furthermore we assume a large on - site repulsion u. we can then model a ladder by independent rungs . assuming a quarter filled ladder ( one electron per rung ) we have a simple two level problem leading to bonding and anti - bonding levels ( see also the discussion in the section on applications of sum rules ) .",
    "if we also include a potential energy difference @xmath113 between the sites the wavefunctions become asymmetric with higher probability on the low potential site and one can show that this again leads to bonding and anti - bonding solutions which are split by an energy @xcite ,    optical conductivity of @xmath126- nav@xmath127o@xmath128 .",
    "inset ( a ) shows the low energy continuum attributed to charged bi - magnon excitations and inset ( b ) shows the temperature dependence of the spectral weight of this continuum .",
    "figure adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=8 ]      transitions from the bonding to anti - bonding band are optically active and involve charge transfer ( ct ) from the left side of the ladder to the right .",
    "the large peak seen in figure [ alphanavo ] around 1 ev is due to these transitions .",
    "the energy position of the peak indirectly gives evidence for the charge inhomogeneity : band structure calculations and exact diagonalization of finite clusters give @xmath219 0.35 ev , which would put the charge transfer peak around 0.7 ev .",
    "the observed value of 1 ev thus indicates @xmath220 0 .",
    "the spectral weight of the peak allows us to make an estimate for @xmath113 .",
    "one can show that , @xmath221 using eq .",
    "( [ ect ] ) we find @xmath219 0.3 ev and @xmath222 0.8 ev . besides the large ct peak seen in figure [ alphanavo ] there is also a broad continuum in the infrared region of the spectrum for @xmath223 ( see inset ) .",
    "this part of the spectrum can be understood if we include the coupling between rungs of the ladder . for parallel spins on different rungs",
    "this coupling would have no effect since the pauli principle would forbid hopping between the sites . for an anti - parallel spin configuration the system can gain some kinetic energy from virtual hopping of an electron from one rung to the next , putting two electrons on one rung .",
    "for very large u this electron would occupy the righthand side of the rung .",
    "starting from an anti - parallel configuration a spin - flip transition on one rung thus leads to a net dipole displacement which leads to optical activity of this transition .",
    "we note that because of spin conservation rules we have to make two spin - flips .",
    "these excitations have been dubbed charged bi - magnon excitations .",
