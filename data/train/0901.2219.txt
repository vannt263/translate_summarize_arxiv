    "although many gamma - ray burst ( grb ) x - ray light - curves roughly follow a ` canonical ' decay of initially steep and then flat ( the so - called ` plateau ' phase ) , before settling into a classical power - law decline phase ( see , e.g. nousek et al . 2006 ; zhang et al .",

    "the emission rose smoothly until about 200  seconds after the trigger , at which point a long , steady decay set in , continuing unbroken until the afterglow could no longer be detected after a few 10@xmath1  s. here we show that , in contrast to grb  060218 , the early emission peak is probably the rising afterglow emission ; there is no evidence for a supernova shock breakout .",

    "their extra component was required to model an excess at higher energies , though , and there were no obvious humps in the light - curves , although there is some possible curvature in grb  061110a ( see http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt@xmath48curves/00238109 ; evans et al . 2007 , 2009 ) .    the excess absorbing column in grb  080307",

    "the xrt light - curve can be modelled as a single , unbroken power - law decay ( with a large , superimposed hump ) , with no evidence for the series of breaks often found in the light - curves of x - ray afterglows ( e.g. nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "it is relatively unusual for a promptly - observed x - ray afterglow to follow a single decay , with only about 15% of _ swift _ xrt light - curves showing no breaks before 100  ks ( evans et al .",

    "kobayashi et al . ( 2007 ) discuss how synchrotron self - inverse comptonisation ( ssc ) can cause electrons in the reverse shock region to be upscattered into the x - ray regime ( reverse shocks are typically expected to radiate photons in the optical or infrared bands ) .",
    "they show that ssc emission can lead to an x - ray flare around the deceleration time using grb  050406 ( romano et al .",
    "2006 ) as an example .",
    "in such a case there needs to be a steep transition from the reverse shock to the forward one ( @xmath21  t@xmath54 from figure 2 of kobayashi et al . ) , but this decay phase could be very short , so can be accommodated by our data .",
    "reverse shock emission can only explain single flares and , in the thick shell case , is expected to overlap in time with the prompt emission .",

    "the long duration of the hump would make this a very slow flare for early times and the spectral softening seen at the start of the curvature is also unusual for a flare . in the case of the reverse shock interpretation , the transition to the forward shock would have to be very short to be hidden within the data .",
    "all of these mechanisms are viable explanations of the observed properties , however the onset of the x - ray afterglow remains a natural interpretation .",
    "the authors acknowledge support for this work at the university of leicester by stfc .",
    "we thank gordon stewart for advice regarding the sky density of faint x - ray sources and the referee for helpful comments which improved the paper .",
