    "an alternative theory @xcite ascribes _ swift _ j1644 + 57 to an encounter of a wd with an imbh .    when particle acceleration is inefficient , then the only radiation from the jet is the photospheric emission @xcite .",
    "the radiation field is in a thermal equilibrium with matter within a dense hot jet up to the distance @xmath10 along the jet , called a photospheric radius , where the optical depth to compton scattering is about unity @xmath11 .",

    "the shock breakout model states that the nuclear explosion following the collapse of a massive core launches a shock wave , which propagates out through the star @xcite .",

    "mildly relativistic ejecta velocity with @xmath64 was proposed in later modeling by @xcite , who also stated that the emission should come from the photosphere above the stellar surface .",

    "the shock breakout theory has its problems .",

    "yet , @xcite proposed a model in application to _ swift _ j1644 + 57 , where a magnetar powers a grb source over many days or even weeks .",
    "the relativistic jet is a natural explanation for the source .",
    "however , if grb060218 was a grb , then it clearly was an unusual one .",
    "the long grbs have large total energies @xmath77  erg @xcite , short durations @xmath78  s @xcite , and higher lorentz factors @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the high lorentz factor of a typical long grb is the consequence of jet confinement by the pressure from the star @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the grb population does not extend to the slow low - luminosity end .",

    "below we propose that the jet is launched by a tidal disruption .",
    "this model provides the explanations for the observed event duration , the spectrum , and the lightcurve .",
    "grb060218 can be best modeled by a low - luminosity wide mildly relativistic outflow / jet .",

    "we calibrated the normalization to reproduce a typical observed wd radius @xcite for one solar mass @xmath84 .",
    "a tidal radius depends weakly on the bh mass , while the event horizon radius @xmath85 is proportional to the bh mass .",

    "the disk exists as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) , since the material density is very high and the photons can not escape @xcite .",
    "the fallback rate determines the accretion rate during the early evolution of the system .",
    "after the disk is formed , it starts to evolve on a slow viscous timescale for @xmath110 radius @xcite .",
    "such evolution changes the temporal slope of the accretion rate to @xmath20 for adiabatic riafs @xcite .",

    "the magnetic field lines get advected towards the bh event horizon with the fallback material .",
    "the magnetic field of a wd is typically within @xmath118  g @xcite with only a few examples of a stronger field .",
    "since the wd radius is on the order of the bh gravitational radius , then no field amplification is expected due to compression in the converging fallback flow .",

    "our disruption models have the peak accretion rate of about @xmath306 at the time @xmath307",
    "s after the disruption ( neglecting the effect of blowing the material away by a supernova ) . then assuming @xmath107 law we find that the accretion rate is down to the eddington value for a standard @xmath308 efficiency at @xmath309  yr . as described in   [ subsec : afterglow ] , the accretion rate is expected to follow a shallow @xmath20 slope after about @xmath310  s due to the viscous evolution in the disk . yet , as we will describe below in ",
    "[ subsec : ms_imbh ] , when the outer disk boundary diffuses out to be much larger than @xmath111 , then the energy transfer between the inner and the outer disk kicks in .",
    "the energy from the inner flow unbinds the outer material and the accretion rate onto the bh dramatically decreases .",
    "@xcite derived the temporal dependence of the accretion rate in the riaf with the energy transfer / convection to be @xmath311 , where the parameter @xmath312 controls the convection efficiency .",
    "the value of @xmath312 varies from @xmath313 for no energy transfer up to @xmath314 for the maximum energy transfer power .",
    "then the accretion rate may decrease as steeply as @xmath315 in the riaf phase .",
    "we will discuss the riafs with convection in more detail in ",
    "[ subsec : ms_imbh ] .",
    "the onset of riaf with the energy transfer may explain the steeper xrt flux dependence @xmath316 at times @xmath317  s , accompanied by a nearly constant hardness ratio .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate may fall below the eddington rate at times @xmath318  yr .    yet",
    ", the eddington luminosity for a @xmath319 bh corresponds to a flux @xmath320 which is about a factor of @xmath321 higher than the late - time flux observed by the xrt .",
    "this is not a contradiction , however , as at times much before @xmath322  yr the accretion disk might not be visible at all due to obscuration by the outflowing debris . as discussed in our previous paper @xcite , the outflowing debris consisting of carbon and oxygen have high absorption cross - section @xmath323 across @xmath324  kev band .",
    "the observed matter velocity in sn2006aj is about @xmath325 @xcite .",
    "a tidal disruption may scatter matter in particular directions leaving huge voids , though which the inner disk could be observed . a tidal disruption of an object with the size comparable to the tidal radius rather tends to scatter the debris over the large solid angle @xcite . in addition",
    ", the supernova , whose energy release is comparable to the energy release in a tidal disruption , should scatter the debris more uniformly in all directions .",
    "following @xcite we find that the absorption optical depth unity @xmath326 is achieved around @xmath327  yrs , at which time the source is expected to rebrighten . as the accretion disk should have a substantially sub - eddington accretion rate by @xmath96  yrs , the emitted flux levels @xmath328 .",
    "the accretion flow with the sub - eddington accretion rate settles into a thin disk @xcite , which has the inner temperature about @xmath329 the temperature is @xmath330  kev for the accretion rate equal to @xmath331 of the eddington value and the bh mass @xmath6 .",
    "very soft blackbody spectrum absorbed by the galactic column and the host galaxy column leads to the ratio @xmath332 of the model flux to the observed absorbed flux and the observed flux @xmath333 , which might not be detectable .",

    "most of slim disk emission would lie in x - rays with only under @xmath335 contribution by optical / uv at photon energies below @xmath37  ev .",
    "a possibility that the disk dominates the emission starting as early as @xmath237  s , at which point the source flux equals the eddington flux of a hypothesized imbh , is unrealistic .",
    "the observed x - ray flux @xmath336 and the dereddened optical / uv fluxes @xmath337 @xcite are substantially super - eddington according to equation ( [ eq : fedd ] ) .",
    "the imbhs are thought to reside either in the gcs or in the dwarf galaxies . as we discussed in the earlier work @xcite",
    ", the disruption rate of stars by imbhs in gcs is very uncertain .",
    "@xcite predicts that for a gc with a @xmath338 central imbh , the optimistic disruption rate of stars is @xmath339 per gc , while @xmath28 of all disruptions are those of wds .",
    "then , following @xcite we theoretically estimate the space density of the gcs to be @xmath340 which leads to the rate @xcite @xmath341 of the wd disruptions by the imbhs .",
    "observational constraints on the gc population suggest a slightly lower space density of the gcs @xcite @xmath342 so that the rate estimate should be revised down to @xmath343    the disruption rate of stars in dwarf galaxies was estimated to be very high .",
    "if @xmath344 @xcite and @xmath345 @xcite relations hold down to the low bh masses , then the predicted tidal disruption rate is higher for the dwarf galaxies compared to the other galaxies @xcite .",
    "dependent on the radial stellar profile the disruption rate in a dwarf galaxy with a @xmath1 bh varies from @xmath346 per galaxy up to @xmath347 per galaxy . for an estimate",
    "we take the rate of @xmath348 per galaxy .",
    "note that during a tidal disruption some fraction @xmath89 of a wd accretes onto a bh .",
    "then the mass of an imbh grows at a rate @xmath349 taking a large fiducial fraction @xmath350 we find that the bh mass doubles every @xmath351 years solely due to tidal disruptions of wds , where we assumed that the same @xmath352 of the disrupted stars are the wds .",
    "this doubling is consistent with the estimated age of grb060218 host galaxy @xmath353  myr @xcite .",
    "as we will show in the next subsection , an imbh swallows only a small fraction of a ms star , so that the imbh mass growth rate due to the ms stars may not be dominant .    according to observations @xcite the number density of dwarf _ d _ galaxies with v magnitude @xmath354 is about the number density of large elliptical _ e _ and spiral _ s _ galaxies .",
    "thus , the space density of dwarf galaxies is @xmath355 .",
    "then , assuming that every dwarf galaxy has a small enough imbh , we arrive at a rate estimate @xmath356 which is much larger than the rate in gcs .",
    "one event per year for the field of view ( fov ) @xmath331 of the sky would happen as close as @xmath357 .",

    "collimation into a wide jetted outflow may reduce the rate down to one event per several years consistently with a single grb060218 source at @xmath358  mpc distance .",
    "since the wd disruptions by the imbhs produce supernovae , we can compare the rate of those with the total supernova rates .",
    "@xcite find the local rate of supernovae type ia to be @xmath359 and the rate of supernovae type ib / c to be @xmath360 . in an optimistic estimate , if a supernova is produced in every tidal disruption of a wd , then one disruption - induced supernova happens per @xmath141 type ia supernovae .",
    "a distinctive feature of disruption - induced supernovae is their location in the galactic nuclei substantially close to the photometric centers of their dwarf host galaxies .",
    "this rate equals to the rate of calcium - rich gap transients , whose properties may be explained by the underluminous explosions of the wds @xcite .",
    "however , those transients occur very far from the galactic nuclei .      in the present paper",
    "we consider the radiative signatures of the wd disruptions by the imbhs .",
    "however , the disruptions rates of the ms stars by the imbhs are several times higher .",
    "then the question is whether these more frequent events produce equally distinct and observable signatures . in this subsection",
    "we show that ms star / imbh disruptions are quite different : they are much longer and much fainter . despite lower rates",
    ", it might be easier to observe the wd / imbh disruptions compared to the ms star / imbh disruptions .",
    "the fallback timescale is about @xmath361  days for a disruption of a @xmath362 ms star with a solar radius by a @xmath1 imbh with a pericenter radius equal to the tidal radius @xmath363 .",
    "the peak fallback rate is @xmath364 . while a tidal disruption radius is @xmath365 for a wd , a ms star with the solar mass and the solar radius has a much larger @xmath366 . since the peak fallback accretion rate @xmath364 is much above the eddington rate @xmath367 , the riaf settles from the outer disk radius @xmath368 down to the bh . a riaf with an outer radius greater than about @xmath369 settles into the convection dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ) @xcite , where the energy transport between the inner and the outer flow starts to play a role . unlike the fallback disks following the wd disruptions , the disks following the disruptions of the ms stars always exist in cdaf state .",
    "a flow with convection has a shallow density profile @xmath370 down to the inner radius @xmath371 @xcite .",
    "only a small fraction of available matter accretes in cdaf state .",
    "the sustained bh accretion rate is @xmath372 the density slope @xmath373 was found in the numerical simulations ( see @xcite for the review ) .",
    "the value @xmath374 was estimated by @xcite for sgr a*. the flow settles on a viscous timescale @xmath375  day , which is shorter than @xmath361  days .",
    "thus , the peak accretion rate of the cdaf is given by the formula  ( [ eq : mdotcdaf ] ) with @xmath376 .",
    "the peak accretion rate onto the bh can be a factor of @xmath377 lower than the peak fallback rate @xmath378    let us make a fiducial estimate for a bh mass @xmath1 and a disruption of a sun - like star for @xmath363 assuming density slope @xmath379 . in this case the accretion rate is lowered by a factor of @xmath380 due to the action of convection according to the formula  ( [ eq : mdotcdaf ] ) , and the resultant jet power is @xmath381 with the same fiducial efficiency @xmath382 used in estimates for the wd disruptions .",
    "a jet with such low power has the photospheric radius smaller than the saturation radius .",
    "the radiation decouples from matter before the jet can accelerate , and the powerful photospheric emission is not expected .",
    "the photospheric radius corresponds to the bulk lorentz factor @xmath383 . if the source is beamed towards us , then the observed temperature is @xmath384  kev .",
    "the radiated blackbody luminosity is @xmath385 , which corresponds to the distance @xmath386  mpc to match the peak flux level @xmath387 of grb060218 .",
    "the absorption by the cooled down jet exhaust or the dense wind , which consist mostly of hydrogen and helium , may substantially lower the x - ray luminosity and turn the source into an optical / uv transient similar to the disruption of a ms star by a smbh @xcite .",
    "the optical / uv transients lasting for @xmath141  days and releasing up to @xmath388 may be confused with variability of the agns . according to the standard theory @xcite at @xmath389  days",

    ", the timescale @xmath261 was derived for the adiabatic riafs .",
    "the temporal behavior of radiatively inefficient fallback accretion disks with convection were not explored to our knowledge and should be investigated in the future work .",
    "if absorption is inefficient , then one transient per year is expected at a distance @xmath391  mpc with the peak flux level of about @xmath392 .",
    "searches within the existing and future x - ray and optical surveys should identify such sources and constrain the rates of tidal disruptions of various kinds .",
    "rosat all - sky survey search revealed several nearby tidal disruption candidates with redshifts @xmath393 @xcite .",
    "some of those candidates , e.g. rx j1242 - 1119 , can not be easily matched with a large host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the absence of suitable x - ray / optical transients in the data might not immediately invalidate high tidal disruption rates .",
    "for example , if the jet power in the disruptions of the ms stars is as weak as in grb060218 , then the x - ray / optical flux from such disruptions is expected to be up to @xmath321 times lower .",
    "the detailed analysis of the tidal disruptions of the ms stars is beyond the scope of the present manuscript .",
    "a candidate source for a stellar disruption by an imbh is a source in a gc ngc1399 explored by @xcite .",
    "observed at a distance @xmath141  mpc the source exhibited x - ray luminosity of @xmath394 and luminosity of a few @xmath395 in oxygen and nitrogen optical lines .",
    "these properties were found consistent with a disruption of a horizontal branch star by a @xmath396 bh @xcite .",
    "in this paper we explore the theory of the wd tidal disruptions by the imbhs , an understudied , but a very promising type of an encounter .",
    "the high rate of the wd tidal disruptions in dwarf galaxies warrants the search for candidates among already observed objects .",
    "we identify grb060218 with the accompanying supernova sn2006aj as a promising candidate and model its temporal / spectral properties and the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "grb060218 was explored previously within the supernova shock breakout model and the model , where a jet is launched by a newborn bh or a neutron star .",
    "we find the tidal disruption model to be a viable alternative , which more naturally explains some features of the candidate . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the application of the tidal disruption model to grb060218/sn2006aj source , and compare different models of the source .",
    "the tidal disruption model performs equally well compared to other models in terms of event rates .",

    "the rate of low - luminosity grbs such as our source was estimated to be about @xmath331 of supernova type ib / c rate @xcite .",
    "a number of shock breakouts were observed to accompany supernovae at all distances @xcite , and the sample of shock breakouts is likely incomplete .",
    "the long emission duration @xmath307  s provides a mass estimate @xmath212 for an imbh within a tidal disruption scenario .",
    "the relativistic shock breakout model also explains the event duration @xcite .",
    "the extreme smoothness of the spectrum is consistent with either the supernova shock breakout or the jet launched by an imbh .",
    "the jet launched by a stellar mass central object may produce more time variability .",
    "while the observed absorbed x - ray lightcurve of the event can be fitted with the exponential decay within a shock breakout model @xcite , the source flux corrected for the absorption exhibits @xmath399 behavior specific to the tidal disruptions . moreover",
    ", the full soft x - ray lightcurve including the rise and the decay phases can be fitted well with the accretion rate temporal dependence @xmath0 for a tidal disruption .",
    "the steep flux decay at @xmath400  s can be ascribed to the source being more heavily absorbed at late times , while the jet power and the radiation power still scale as @xmath107 .",
    "the power - law decay is not expected in a shock breakout , while a shallower temporal slope is expected for a jet - powered source @xcite .",
    "the temporal slope of the afterglow phase , powered by the central engine , is consistent with the accretion rate temporal dependence @xmath20 in a riaf dominated by the disk evolution behavior .",
    "the observed blackbody flux and the blackbody temperature can be readily modeled by the jet photospheric emission to provide the estimates for the imbh mass @xmath212 and the lorentz factor @xmath191 .",
    "moreover , these estimates stay consistent between different time slices in our time - resolved spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the rise of the blackbody temperature accompanied by the constant blackbody flux and the dropping total flux leads to the same bh mass and lorentz factor over many time slices within the fireball model .",
    "the relativistic shock in the wind region of a wr star is able to reproduce the spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of the underlying wr star and its wind would be peculiar @xcite .",
    "the absence of the jet break is consistent with the wide outflow produced without the pressure support from the surrounding star .",
    "both the supernova shock breakout and the tidal disruption scenario produce wide outflows .",
    "strong early optical / uv emission is consistent with coming from the jet front .",
    "the non - relativistic outer shells producing early optical / uv blackbody emission violate the source energetics @xcite within the supernova shock breakout model .",
    "in addition , the total radiated energy @xmath401  erg of grb060218 is somewhat higher than expected for the shock breakouts @xcite in general .",
    "the host of grb060218 is a dwarf galaxy , and the dwarf galaxies are expected to have the highest tidal disruption rates . only the dwarf galaxies and not the bigger galaxies are expected to have the imbhs in their nuclei , and thus disrupt the wds .",
    "we crudely estimate the central bh mass @xmath212 based on the stellar mass @xmath402 of the host .",
    "the supernova position is consistent with the center of the host dwarf galaxy , as it should be for the tidal disruption scenario .",
