    "the field of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) astronomy was transformed in early 1997 , when sub - arcminute localization of the burst grb  970228 by the gamma- and x - ray instruments on the bepposax satellite allowed the first firm optical identification of a fading grb counterpart @xcite . within months , a second optical counterpart was found @xcite , for grb  970508 , allowing the first spectroscopic limit on the distance to a grb , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "there are now nearly ten bursts with identified optical counterparts , including three with measured redshifts .",
    "( galama _ et  al .",
    "its x - ray and optical luminosity would be far below that of the other grbs with spectroscopic identitication , and it most likely represents a different class of objects ( kulkarni _ et  al .",
    "_ 1998 , hogg and fruchter 1998 ) from the other grbs discussed in this work . ]",
    "the fading counterpart of grb  970228 remains one of the best studied of this new class of astronomical objects , but the observations have been confusing . early hst imagery suggested the presence of a nebulosity centered @xmath11  arcsecond from the point - like fading transient source @xcite .",
    "tentative evidence was presented that the nebular emission was fading @xcite , and a proper motion of 550  mas  yr@xmath12 was reported for the fading point source @xcite , though the measurement was disputed @xcite .",
    "either a fading nebula or a measurable proper motion would ineluctably lead to the conclusion that grb  970228 was a galactic event , unlike grb  970508 and the other bursts with measured redshifts .    to help resolve the situation , and to further characterize the broadband spectral properties of the grb counterpart",
    ", we have reobserved grb  970228 with keck and hst .",
    "although the earlier hst observations of grb  970228 employed wfpc2 , we have availed ourselves of the newly installed stis ccd and nicmos camera 2 .",
    "the excellent throughputs , broad bandpasses and wide spectral coverage of these instruments , combined with the long time baseline since the gamma - ray burst , provide us with a superb opportunity to study the nature of the source and its environment .",
    "the field of grb  970228 was imaged during two hst orbits on 4 september 1997 from 15:50:33 to 18:22:41 ut , using the stis ccd in clear aperture ( 50ccd ) mode .",
    "two exposures of 575s each were taken at each of four dither positions for a total exposure time of 4600s .",
    "the exposures were dithered to allow removal of hot pixels and to obtain the highest possible resolution .",
    "the images were bias and dark subtracted , and flat - fielded using the stis pipeline .",
    "the final image was created and cleaned of cosmic rays and hot pixels using the variable pixel linear reconstruction algorithm ( a.k.a .",
    "drizzle ) developed for the hubble deep field ( hdf ) @xcite .",
    "the photometric calibration of the images was performed using the synthetic photometry package synphot in iraf / stsdas , although total throughput was renormalized by approximately 12% to agree with the on - orbit recalibration of the stis ccd by landsman ( 1997 ) .",
    "this adjustment agrees well both with estimates derived by comparison of the stellar magnitudes in the wfpc2 f606w image of the grb  970228 field with those of the stis image , and with an independent calibration of the stis ccd performed by sahu _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the stis ccd in clear aperture mode has a broad bandpass , with a significant response from 200 to 900 nm that peaks near 600 nm . as a result",
    ", stis instrumental magnitudes are most accurately translated into the standard filter set by quoting the result as a @xmath13 magnitude , but in any case knowledge of an object s intrinsic spectrum is required for an accurate conversion .",
    "here we are fortunate to have an earlier image of the field in both v(f606w ) and i(f814w ) with the wfpc2 .",
    "we therefore can use colors determined in these earlier observations to interpret the stis data .",
    "however , to the extent that the wfpc2 colors are in error ( either due to low signal - to - noise ratio or an actual change in the color of the object over time ) our derived magnitudes from the stis data will be biased by about 0.5 magnitudes for each magnitude of error in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the ot was determined from the drizzled image via aperture photometry .",
    "the flux in an aperture of radius four drizzled pixels , or @xmath15 , was determined , and our best estimate of the surrounding nebular background was subtracted .",
    "an aperture correction of @xmath16 magnitudes was derived for this aperture using the bright star visible in figure 1 to the west of the nebula .",
    "we find that the ot has a count rate of @xmath17 counts per second for a derived magnitude of @xmath18 , where the final error includes the uncertainty of the conversion to the standard photometric bandpass .",
    "we determined the magnitude of the nebula by summing all pixels in a region of approximately @xmath19 sq .",
    "arcsec . surrounding the object .",
    "the flux of the point source was then subtracted from the sum .",
    "we find a flux of @xmath20 counts per second and a magnitude of @xmath21 for the nebula .",
    "again , the final error is dominated by the uncertainty of the @xmath14 color of the object , for which we have only the previous , comparatively noisy , wfpc2 observations of the field @xcite .",
    "however , the wfpc2 observations provide us with a baseline of 162 days , and thus an excellent opportunity to investigate the variability and claimed proper motion of the ot , as well as to determine whether the apparent magnitude of the extended emission has remained constant .      in order to search for proper motion of the ot and possible changes in the apparent brightness of the extended source",
    ", we have reexamined the wfpc2 images obtained in march and april of 1997 @xcite .",
    "the wfpc2 images were processed using the standard wfpc2 data pipeline , and cosmic rays removed using the standard stsdas task `` crrej '' .",
    "the centroids of the four reference stars used as positional anchors by sahu _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997b ) were redetermined using 2-dimensional gaussian fits to both the wfpc2 and stis images .",
    "the positional accuracy for the reference stars is approximately 3 mas in each coordinate at each epoch , while for the relatively faint grb it is @xmath2210 mas .",
    "the measured pixel - coordinates were corrected for the cameras geometric distortion using the gilmozzi _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) solutions for the wfpc2 images , and a solution derived by malamuth and bowers ( 1997 ) for the stis images .",
    "the stis pixel - coordinates were then transformed to the corresponding wfpc2 pixel - coordinates , taking into account the rotation , translation and the image scale change while assuming zero mean motion of the four reference stars .",
    "this procedure was performed on the wfpc2 v and i - band images separately .",
    "the positions of the four stars in the wfpc2 images agree with their positions in the stis images to within the expected uncertainties of 3 mas in both colors , which shows that the transformations between the two images have been done correctly .",
    "averaging together all of the data we find that any motion of the grb between the two epochs is less than @xmath23  mas .",
    "this corresponds to a motion of less than 36  mas per year .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath24 less than the value claimed by caraveo _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) , and improves the upper limit on the proper motion reported by sahu _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997b ) by a factor of six .",
    "to check on the previous wfpc2 photometry of the ot and extended emission , the point source magnitude was determined by using circular apertures of radii 1 and 3 pixels in the wfpc2 images .",
    "the values obtained were then adjusted by applying the aperture corrections and in the case of f606w , the color term for transformation to johnson v , derived by holtzman _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "the nebular magnitude was determined from the wfpc2 images by taking the sum of all counts above sky in a box approximately @xmath25 , and subtracting the counts ( estimated as above ) attributable to the point source .",
    "the position of this box was determined by the position of the nebula in the stis image .",
    "it is , however , somewhat larger than the observed nebula in all directions .",
    "averaging together the two wfpc2 observations , we obtain magnitudes for the extended emission of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this visual magnitude is remarkably consistent with the stis measurement .      on 24 february 1998",
    ", we obtained a total integration time of @xmath28s , over four orbits , on the field of grb  970228 using the f160w ( h ) filter of nicmos camera 2 .",
    "a similar set of exposures in the f110w ( j ) filter , scheduled for the previous day , were lost when a cosmic ray event in the the nicmos electronics caused the camera to be reset during the first of the four orbits . however , as the f160w band on nicmos is extremely sensitive and provides greater leverage in wavelength than the f110w filter when compared with wfpc2 and stis imaging , the observations in hand remain immensely useful .",
    "each of the four orbits was subdivided into a single @xmath29s and two @xmath30s exposures , with two dither positions performed each orbit .",
    "all exposures were taken using multiple initial and final reads , or mif sequences . in all , eight dither positions were placed roughly along a @xmath31 diagonal line .",
    "the images were processed using a variant of the standard nicmos pipeline . ",
    "superdark \" reference files were produced for the mif512 and mif1024 sequences using a sigma - clipped average ( 3 sigma ) of 20 multiaccum on - orbit darks in each sequence , taken in november 1997 .",
    "first an estimate of the thermal background , the pedestal ( a constant offset in each of the four chip quadrants ) and shading ( effectively a ramp in bias across each quadrant ) were subtracted from the multiaccum sequences",
    ". then flat - fielding , cosmic - ray rejection and conversion to count - rates were performed . when the final images were combined using drizzle , noticeable streaking along the diagonal of the dither , as well as large scale noise remained , even after further image defects and residual cosmic - rays were removed using the cosmic - ray rejection scheme described in fruchter and hook ( 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore created `` sky '' images using a technique very similar to that employed by ground - based infrared astronomers .",
    "first , the median of all mif1024 and mif512 images were separately obtained while masking out the astrophysical objects detected in the drizzled image previously created .",
    "these images revealed significant structure in the sky that differed substantially between the mif512 and mif1024 images .",
    "we therefore created an individual sky for each image by taking the median of all the other images of the same exposure time while masking regions known to include astrophysical objects in the first drizzled image .",
    "we found that four mif512 images were insufficient to make acceptable sky images ; however the sky subtraction appeared to work well for the mif1024 images .",
    "the final combination of the eight sky subtracted mif1024 images shows no evidence of correlated noise along the direction of the dither pattern , and the noise on arcsecond scales has been reduced by more than a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , since the individual images are read noise limited , the neglected mif512 images represent only about one - eighth of the total signal - to - noise ratio of the data , and therefore their loss does not significantly affect the final signal - to - noise ratio that can be achieved .    the extended emission can be clearly seen in the nicmos image displayed in figure  [ f : both ] . the same @xmath32 aperture as used in the wfpc2 image reveals a total count rate of @xmath33 counts per second in the nic2 f160w filter , which corresponds to @xmath34  njy or a magnitude of @xmath35 .",
    "there is no sign of the ot in the nicmos image ; we find a @xmath36 upper limit on the flux density of the ot of @xmath37 or @xmath38  njy .",
    "images of the grb 970228 field were obtained in the k - band on april 8 , 1998 with the keck i 10 m telescope and nirc @xcite . a 9-point - pattern mosaic of individual 10-second exposures was obtained and co - added to produce an image with total exposure time of 2160 seconds .",
    "the resulting image point spread function measured @xmath39 fwhm .",
    "the flux of the extended source was measured inside a @xmath32 diameter aperture centered on the source , and an approximate aperture correction to @xmath40 was made using the curve of growth of the nearby star .",
    "calibration was performed using the infrared standards of persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , including an airmass correction term .",
    "we obtain @xmath6 or @xmath41  njy .",
    "thus , within the errors , the spectrum of the extended emission is flat in @xmath42 between h and k.    ccccc + & & & + instrument & band & date ( ut ) & optical transient & nebulosity + hst / wfpc2 & f606w / v & 26 mar 1997 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 + hst / wfpc2 & f814w / i & 26 mar 1997 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 + hst / wfpc2 & f606w / v & 07 apr 1997 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + hst / wfpc2 &",

    ", we have again used the stellar image @xmath56 to the east of the ot as a point spread function .",
    "we find that we can subtract a point source from the position of the ot and leave behind a `` nebula '' as faint as , or fainter than , the extended emission in the hst / stis image without producing any noticeable sky subtraction errors .",
    "thus , we find no evidence that the nebula has faded with time .",
    "grb  970228 lies in the direction of @xmath57 and @xmath58 . as a result ,",
    "its apparent visual magnitude and color are significantly affected by interstellar extinction in our galaxy .",
    "therefore , we have used several techniques to estimate the foreground galactic extinction in its direction , so that we can obtain the true colors and unextincted magnitudes of the ot and the surrounding nebulosity .",
    "the colors and counts of background galaxies suggest @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the catalogs of burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) and schlegel _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1998 ) give 0.8 and 0.75 respectively , with errors of approximately 0.15 mag .",
    "the color of a background k4v star in the field suggests @xmath60 , and the nai absorption in its spectrum implies a strong upper limit of @xmath61 . for the remainder of this paper",
    "then , we will use the value @xmath62 , which is roughly the average of the estimates .",
    "however , because this value is noticeably less than that published by castander and lamb ( 1997 ) , we discuss our derivation of the extinction in detail in an appendix .      in figure",
    "[ f : ot ] we plot the magnitude of the ot as a function of time since the burst on 28 february 1997 .",
    "the stis magnitude has been converted to r using the color determined from the wfpc2 v and i observations .",
    "a power law of the form @xmath63 has been fitted to the hst points and extrapolated back to earlier times .",
    "we find a best fit of @xmath64 .",
    "a host r magnitude of 25.3 has been subtracted from all non - hst magnitudes .",
    "this is the _ minimum _ host r brightness consistent with an interpolation of the v and i data .",
    "if the host is in fact somewhat brighter than this , a proper subtraction would leave the first few points on the plot virtually unchanged , but would somewhat _ increase _ the discrepancy between the power - law extrapolation and the points taken 4 to 11 days after outburst .",
    "the outlying points were taken at different observatories and reduced by different groups of observers .",
    "one of these points is , in fact , the ntt data that we have ourselves re - reduced as described above .",
    "we do not believe that these points can be discounted .",
    "keck observations of grb  970228 taken on 30 and 31 march 1997 showed total magnitudes , for the sum of ot and host , of @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this k band magnitude is about a factor of two greater than seen in our observations , one year later .",
    "therefore , it would appear that in late march 1997 , the optical luminosity in k was equally divided between ot and extended emission .",
    "similarly if we interpolate the j and k values to estimate an h magnitude in late march 1997 , and compare this with the observed hst f160w magnitude , we again find that the power in the object is equally divided between host and ot .",
    "furthermore , the estimated h and k flux densities for the ot on march 30 are equal within the errors with an average value of @xmath67  njy .",
    "because the ot appears to have followed a power - law decline between 26 march 1997 and 7 april 1997 , we can use the power - law to interpolate the f814w to the 31 march 1997 .",
    "remarkably one finds that the f814w flux density is @xmath68  njy .",
    "thus the spectrum of the ot is flat in @xmath42 between 800 and 2200  nm .",
    "in contrast , even after correcting for foreground galactic extinction , the @xmath14 color of the ot implies a spectrum @xmath69 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have infrared magnitudes for the ot at other times , and therefore we can not tell whether this break in the spectrum is constant with time , or whether it results from strong temporal variability of the ot in the infrared .",
    "it is certainly too abrupt , however , to be due to extinction in a host galaxy . while strong theoretical arguments exist for expecting temporal variability in the ot @xcite , it is far from clear that the variability that would be required ( at least a factor of 3 - 6 ) could occur in one region of the spectrum , while another , an octave away , was unaffected .",
    "however , a break in the spectrum at @xmath70 m , or @xmath71  hz , is also not expected at late times in the standard model ( see , for example , sari , piran and narayan 1998 ) , nor is it seen in the well - studied ( and well - behaved ) spectrum of grb  970508 @xcite .    nonetheless , the fact that for over 180 days , the ot behaved roughly as the predicted power - law @xcite is quite remarkable  for as the fireball of the burst expands , it sweeps up the material of the ism surrounding it , and its power - law expansion should falter when it has absorbed an ism rest mass comparable to the energy of the initial explosion , or when @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the initial energy of the explosion in units of @xmath74 ergs and @xmath75 is the density of the surrounding medium in protons per cubic centimeter .",
    "however , were the grb a galactic rather than an extragalactic phenomenon , the amount of energy available would only be of order @xmath76 ergs , and for any imaginable density the break would occur on a timescale of days rather than many months , although as noted by panaitescu and mszros ( 1998 ) , this break can be mitigated by a significantly non - spherical outflow geometry .",
    "nonetheless , the power law fit is in itself an argument for the extragalactic nature of the burst , and thus is in agreement with all the other evidence presented in this paper .",
    "if the extended emission under the ot is truly a host galaxy , rather than , as has been proposed , a reflection nebula from an explosion in our own galaxy @xcite , then one would expect it to have a size and color which is reasonable for a galaxy of its magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "if a large fraction of the sky is covered by galaxies whose observed properties are similar to the proposed host , then even if the nebulosity is shown to be a galaxy , one would still have little evidence that it is indeed the host , rather than a chance superposition of a galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "we have therefore compared the observed extended emission with galaxies found in the hdf . after adjusting for the differing depths and pixel sizes of the stis and hdf images and the extinction in the direction of grb  970228 , we find that only @xmath77 of the hdf is covered by galaxies of comparable or greater surface brightness of the putative host ( 25.3 mag / arcsec@xmath78 ) .",
    "this result is similar to , but tighter than , that of sahu _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ 1997 , and implies that the probability of a chance superposition is negligible .",
    "furthermore , we find that the area on the sky of the proposed host ( @xmath79  arcsec@xmath78 ) is near the median of galaxies of similar magnitude in the hdf .",
    "the most remarkable result , however , arises when we compare the color of the host with that of other galaxies in the hdf . in figure",
    "[ f : hdf ] we show the spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy and compare it to the colors and magnitudes of objects in the hdf .",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath81 band hdf magnitudes are from kpno / irim observations of the hdf @xcite .",
    "the f606w images of the hdf have been convolved to the ground - based resolution and colors determined using isophotal magnitudes .",
    "we use ab magnitudes here rather than vega magnitudes to conform to other work that has been done on the hdf , where @xmath42 is given in @xmath82jy .",
    "the zeropoint of the ab magnitude system , unlike the vega magnitude system , does not depend upon wavelength ; however , the zeropoint of the ab magnitude system has been set so that it agrees with the vega magnitude system in v. ] .    as can be seen in figure  [ f : hdf ] ,",
    "the host of grb  970228 is unusually blue .",
    "indeed , it is as blue as any galaxy in the kpno / irim hdf .",
    "although the completeness limit of this sample is slightly brighter than the magnitude of the host , hst / nicmos observations recently performed on the hdf should soon allow us to test this relation on a sample which has a limiting magnitude safely below the host magnitude . additionally , we find that the host is too blue to be fit by shifting local galaxy templates @xcite ( including blue irregular dwarfs , such as the magellanic clouds ) to higher redshift .",
    "therefore , to attempt to fit the host s colors , we created a grid of synthetic stellar populations as described in babul and ferguson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the models used a salpeter imf from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "metallicities ranged from solar to 0.05 solar .",
    "the e - folding times of the starburst were varied from @xmath85 to @xmath86 yrs , and the age at time of observation from @xmath85 to @xmath86 yrs .",
    "the stellar populations were given internal extinctions from 0 to 2 magnitudes in @xmath87 .",
    "if we require only that a synthetic galaxy agree with the observed colors to within the photometric errors ( @xmath88 ) , we can create galaxies of nearly any age and redshift which match .",
    "however , if we also require that the synthetic galaxy lie within the locus of observed galaxies seen in figure  [ f : hdf ] ( because of the photometric errors , a galaxy could match the host without lying inside the locus ) , the set of possible populations is dramatically reduced .",
    "all stellar populations older than @xmath89 yrs which match have essentially constant star formation rates ( the time of observation is much smaller than the e - folding time of the burst ) ; furthermore , these model galaxies cluster around two redshifts , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the former case , the model is placing the 4000  break between f606w and f814w , and in the latter case the f606w flux is suppressed by the ly@xmath92 forest .",
    "interestingly , at a redshift of @xmath90 the magnitude of the host would imply an intrinsic luminosity comparable to that of the large magellanic cloud , and based on its photometry ( and a conversion of uv luminosity to star formation rate , sfr , ( kennicutt 1998 ) would have have an sfr of @xmath93 , assuming @xmath94 km / s and @xmath95 ; however , at @xmath96 , it would be unusually luminous  noticeably brighter than any of the photometrically identified @xmath96 candidates in the hdf @xcite , and have an sfr of @xmath97 .",
    "one can perhaps further limit possible host galaxies using an absence of evidence : in spite of the expenditure of many hours of spectroscopic time on keck , this object apparently displays no emission lines .",
    "however , a young starburst  or even a continuous starburst  should show [ oii ] ( 3727  ) emission @xcite and in many cases would show ly@xmath92 ( 1216  ) @xcite , though this line can be suppressed by resonant scattering and absorption . for those lines to be present ,",
    "yet unobserved , the redshift of the host would need to be in the range @xmath98  where o[ii ] has left the optical spectroscopic window in the red , yet ly@xmath92 has not yet entered in the blue .",
    "thus the continuous star formation models mentioned above are probably ruled out .",
    "the reason for the extraordinary blue color of the host is most likely the obvious reason ",
    "it is forming stars at an extraordinary rate for its mass .",
    "indeed , all of the preferred stellar population models predict that the doubling time of the stellar mass is @xmath99 yrs , and it is this doubling time , rather than the star formation rate of the host , which will best indicate whether the photometry suggests that grbs are linked with star formation .",
    "indeed , from the slope of faint galaxy counts it can be inferred that in the range @xmath100 the luminosity function of galaxies must have been far steeper than is found locally @xcite .",
    "thus the majority of star formation at these redshifts may be found in galaxies with luminosities ( and sfrs ) well below @xmath101 , the knee of the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "therefore , if grbs are associated with star formation , it will be the colors ( and stellar lines ) rather than the absolute luminosities of the hosts which will provide the proof .",
    "additionally , the comparison of the extinction - corrected color of the host with the hdf provides a good indication that we have not underestimated the foreground galactic extinction .",
    "a larger @xmath102 than the @xmath103 used would have made the object bluer , and caused it to lie even further outside the locus of objects seen in the hdf .",
    "indeed , comparison with the hdf suggests that the somewhat lower extinction of @xmath104 implied by the comparison of the colors of background galaxies may have been closest to the correct extinction . however , even if we were to reduce the assumed extinction to match this estimate , the host would remain unusually blue .",
    "although the host of grb  970228 may be the first host galaxy to have sufficient published multicolor imaging to allow one to constrain the sfr , it is not the first host with strong evidence of star - formation .",
    "all three grbs with measured cosmological redshifts lie in hosts which display prominent emission from lines associated with star - formation , and in all three cases the strength of those lines is high for galaxies of comparable magnitude and redshift @xcite .",
    "although other host galaxies have been observed spectroscopically ( kulkarni , metzger personal communications ) , the fact that no other hosts show lines is not necessarily an argument against strong star formation in these galaxies . as noted by hogg and fruchter ( 1998 ) reasonable models of the cosmological density of grbs with redshift",
    "predict a substantial fraction in the range of @xmath98 where , as mentioned earlier , no strong lines are found in the optical spectroscopic window .",
    "thus , one can argue that in all cases where the observations allow one to determine the sfr , that rate has been found to be high .    unfortunately , our data does not allow us to distinguish between the two leading candidates for the creation of bursts , binary neutron star @xcite and hypernovae @xcite , as binary - neutron star coalescence should occur on a timescale comparable to that of many star bursts ( @xmath105  yrs ) @xcite .",
    "the primary difference one expects for these two models is that due to kicks imparted to the neutron stars at birth , neutron star binaries should occasionally be well outside of a galaxy when the burst occurs @xcite .",
    "however , at present , we are only able to localize bursts using x - ray , radio or optical afterglows . yet the strength of the afterglow may depend critically on the density of the surrounding medium @xcite",
    ". the low density medium of intergalactic space may be too tenuous to produce detectable afterglows . in this case , deciding between binary neutron stars and hypernovae as the progenitors of grbs may require a new generation of space observatories capable of localizing the burst on the basis of gamma - rays alone .",
    "in this appendix we present several different independent methods that we have used to estimate the extinction in the direction of grb  970228 .",
    "we have consulted the extinction catalogs of burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) and schlegel , finkbeiner and davis ( 1997 ) , and have attempted to directly determine the extinction from the counts and colors of galaxies in the wfpc field , as well as from spectroscopy and imaging of galactic stars in the field .",
    "all these methods give consistent results .",
    "burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) have used measured hi column densities and an empirically determined constant of conversion between hi to extinction , in combination with background galaxy counts to derive a map of galactic extinction with a spatial resolution of about @xmath106 . based on their work ,",
    "the extinction in the direction of grb  970228 is @xmath107 .",
    "similarly , schlegel _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) have used the iras @xmath108 maps to estimate foreground galactic extinction , with an angular resolution of @xmath109 .",
    "their work implies an extinction of @xmath110 .",
    "the consistency of these numbers is encouraging , and as will be seen agrees well with our other estimates .",
    "foreground extinction should be visible as a diminution in the number counts of galaxies in the field to a given limiting magnitude , and a reddening of those which are detected .",
    "we therefore have compared the wfpc2 images of the grb  970228 field with those of four high latitude fields taken from the hst archive , the hdf @xcite , the field around the weak radio galaxy 53w002 @xcite , and the fields at @xmath111 , and at @xmath112 imaged by westphal and collaborators as part of hst proposal 5109 . in the case of the hdf ,",
    "the distributed drizzled images were used . in all other cases we reduced the data ourselves , again producing a drizzled output .",
    "further details of the data reduction technique can be found in gonzlez , fruchter and dirsch ( 1998 ) .",
    "the sextractor object extraction software @xcite was used to locate objects , perform star - galaxy separation and obtain photometry on galaxies .",
    "objects were extracted down to a limiting surface brightness in the f606w images of @xmath113 arcsec@xmath114 , which was determined by the shallowest image ( that of the grb field ) .",
    "colors were obtained by placing matching fixed - size apertures of diameter @xmath115 on the f814w fields . to simulate extinction the limiting magnitude",
    "was progressively raised in the reference fields until the number counts and colors matched those of the grb field .",
    "a more detailed account of the actual fitting procedure can be found in gonzlez _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "comparison of the counts in the grb field with those of the hdf and 53w002 field gives a best estimate of extinction of @xmath116 ; however , the two westphal fields have significantly fewer galaxies , by an amount that is large compared to the expected clustering error ( though , as discussed in gonzlez _ et  al .",
    "_ 1998 , this error may be generally underestimated ) .",
    "if these two fields are averaged in with the hdf and 53w002 fields , the best value of extinction is @xmath117 . although the counts differ , the colors of background galaxies in these four fields agree well .",
    "the extinction implied by the average color difference between the grb field and the four background fields is @xmath118 , where the error is the measured dispersion in estimated extinction between the four reference fields using the color index .",
    "however , there may be a slight bias in the color estimation  if the reddening is clumpy , the most reddened background galaxies may fall out of the sample and not affect the average color .",
    "thus the estimate of @xmath104 should probably be viewed as a lower limit . in any case , this estimate is in good agreement with the burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) and schlegel _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1998 ) extinctions .",
    "we have also examined the long - slit spectra of the grb  970228 field obtained by tonry _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997a , b ) , and generously made available on the world wide web , to estimate the extinction to grb  970228 .",
    "the observations were done using the lris spectrograph mounted on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the final combined spectrum covers the wavelength range 4320@xmath1199300   at a spectral resolution of 11 (fwhm ) .",
    "the total exposure time was 5000 s , and the weighted mean airmass was 1.52 .",
    "the slit was 1@xmath120 wide .",
    "we performed flux calibration using a spectrum of spectrophotometric standard star hiltner 600 @xcite with the same slit width .",
    "three stars are present in the slit of the tonry _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ spectrum , denoted s1 , s2 and s3 ( see tonry _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "1997b ) . before extracting the spectra of these stars , we corrected the summed long - slit spectrum for tilt and geometric distortion by measuring the centroids of the stars along the slit as a function of wavelength .",
    "the table of centroid positions was then used to rectify the long - slit spectra , using iraf tasks _ geomap _ and _ geotran_. the star spectra were subsequently extracted using a `` optimal extraction '' algorithm , described by horne ( 1986 ) .",
    "the slit in these observations falls along two k stars in the pc field of the wfpc2 images ( denoted as s1 and s2 as in tonry _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "1997b ) , as well as on the grb itself .",
    "the brightest of these two stars can be clearly identified as a k4v , and it is likely that the other is also a k4v . like castander and lamb ( 1998 ) , we have attempted to fit the observed keck continuum by applying varying extinctions to library k4v spectra @xcite .",
    "_ we find no satisfactory solution_. we can not match the slope across the entire continuum no matter what extinction we use ( examples of poor fits can be seen in figure 3 of castander and lamb ) .",
    "this may be due partially to the fact that the position angle of the slit was approximately @xmath121 from the parallactic angle .",
    "however , this can not entirely account for the effect .",
    "it appears possible that the stars were partially off the slit and/or that the publicly available flat field does not provide a true spectrophotometric correction .    while we may not be able to properly flatten the tonry _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997b ) spectra on large scales , this should not significantly affect our ability to examine the equivalent widths of lines in the spectrum .",
    "in particular , we can use the equivalent width of the interstellar nai @xmath122 doublet ( @xmath123  ) to place a limit on the reddening in the field .    in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ,",
    "gas and dust grains are generally associated with one another .",
    "this was recognized in the 1940 s from the correlations between the intensity of the interstellar nai @xmath122 doublet and the reddening of starlight ( e.g. , spitzer 1948 ) .",
    "indeed , observations of stars at intermediate and high galactic latitudes indicate that the column density of interstellar nai is correlated with   @xcite .",
    "this relationship shows however a rather significant scatter , which can be understood as being due to _ spatial _ variations : for disk stars behind or within dense dark clouds in the solar neighborhood , the equivalent width ( ew ) of interstellar nai in spectra of stars is smaller ( for a given amount of reddening ) than those of more distant stars at high galactic latitude .",
    "this is due to nai depletion in dense clouds , where many heavy elements must be locked onto dust grains ( e.g. , cohen 1973 ) .",
    "another contributor to the scatter in the @xmath124(nai ) vs.  relationship ( at high column densities ) is the effect of ionization :  as the cloud density increases the ratio of neutral to ionized gas increases proportionally , causing _ enhanced _ nai absorption for a given  @xcite .",
    "in order to quantify the interstellar nai absorption vs.  reddening relationship , we show in fig .",
    "[ f : ew_vs_ebv ] @xmath124(nai ) against for a large number of early - type ( o and early b ) stars taken from the literature @xcite . so that we could compare these data to the tonry et al.spectra , which were obtained with a lower dispersion , we selected stars for which both components of the nai doublet were measured .",
    "[ f : ew_vs_ebv ] depicts these data for different lines of sight : _ ( i ) _ nearby stars within or behind dense clouds , _",
    "( ii ) _ distant supergiant stars for which the line of sight goes through the low - density intercloud medium , and _ ( iii ) _ stars at high galactic latitude , for which the reddening arises most probably from the disk layer with a half - thickness of 100 pc @xcite . case _",
    "( ii ) _ is arguably the most appropriate for the line of sight to grb  970228 , since galactic globular clusters at low - latitude show a similar relation between @xmath124(nai ) and  @xcite .    in k main - sequence stars such as s1 and s2",
    ", the nai @xmath122 absorption line strength is partly due to the stellar photosphere .",
    "furthermore , contribution of the stellar photosphere to the total line strength is a function of stellar metallicity . to quantify the stellar contribution ,",
    "we have measured the equivalent widths ( @xmath124 ) of the nai @xmath122 doublet as well as the mgi @xmath125 triplet ( which is a measure of stellar metallicity , and unaffected by the ism ) for stars s1 and s2 and compared them with those of the library k4v star from silva and cornell ( 1992 ) .",
    "the wavelength intervals for the line indices were taken from burstein _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "the results are listed in table  2 .",
    "lcc + star & @xmath124(nai @xmath122 ) & @xmath124(mgi@xmath125 ) + s1 & @xmath126 & @xmath127 + s2 & @xmath128 & @xmath129 + k4v@xmath130 & @xmath131 & @xmath132 +   +    it is evident from table  2 that stars s1 and s2 are more metal rich than the library k4v star , and yet have nai @xmath122 equivalent widths that are at most marginally larger .",
    "the straightforward interpretation of this result is therefore that the interstellar contribution to @xmath124(nai @xmath122 ) ( hereafter @xmath124(nai @xmath122)@xmath133 ) for stars s1 and s2 is consistent with zero . to derive a stringent upper limit to @xmath124(nai @xmath122)@xmath133",
    ", we used the nai @xmath122 profile of the k4v library star as template ( i.e. , purely stellar ) spectrum and evaluated the maximum `` extra '' equivalent width that can be accommodated in the spectrum of star s2 within the errors ( the spectrum of star s1 is too noisy for us to use for this purpose ) .",
    "the resulting upper limit is @xmath124(nai @xmath122)@xmath133@xmath1340.5  .    using the relation of  vs.  @xmath124(nai @xmath122)@xmath133 for distant stars in the galactic disk ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : ew_vs_ebv ] as a solid line , along with two dashed lines that depict the minimum and maximum possible slopes ) , we find that this upper limit to @xmath124(nai @xmath122)@xmath133 translates into  @xmath134 0.25@xmath135  , equivalent to @xmath136 assuming the galactic extinction law of rieke and lebofsky ( 1985 ) .",
    "there is one further means of measuring the extinction available to us .",
    "given that we believe star s2 of tonry _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997b ) can be accurately classified as a k4v , we can examine the f606w and f814w images and compare the observed colors with those of library stars .",
    "we have done this using the iraf / stsdas @xcite program synphot to multiply a standard library spectrum ( chosen from the libraries mentioned above ) with an extinction curve and the response of the wfpc2 instrument .",
    "we find that the ratio of counts per second between the f606w and f814w images of 1.12 is fit with an @xmath60 , where the error is dominated by the choice of library spectrum and form of the galactic extinction curve .",
    "using a reddened library spectrum in synphot we find that s2 has an r band magnitude of 22.85 .",
    "after dereddening this would correspond , for a k4v star , to a distance of @xmath137  kpc .",
    "given that this star is in the galactic anticenter , and at a galactic latitude of @xmath138 , all of the dust along this line of sight is almost certainly between us and the star .",
    "therefore , the reddening of the star is a valid measure of the total extinction in this direction of the sky .",
    "we thank the director of stsci , bob williams , for allocating director s discretionary time to observe grb  970228 using stis .",
    "we benefitted from discussions on the nature and redshift distribution of hosts with david hogg , and on the magnitude of the foreground galactic extinction with francisco castander and don lamb .",
    "we are also grateful to mark dickinson for providing us with a catalog of the hdf / irim detections ."
