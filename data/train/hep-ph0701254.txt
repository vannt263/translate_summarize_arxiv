    "there has been much recent interest in the idea of standard model ( sm ) having a hidden sector wherein the matter content are sm gauge singlets , but transform non - trivially according to the hidden sector gauge groups  @xcite .",
    "hidden sectors arise in many top - down models , including those inspired by the brane world scenario and string theory .",
    "most discussion of them posit an association with a very high mass scale , and their couplings to the visible sm sector are often through nonrenormalizable or loop effects . this need not be the case however , and it has been noticed that through renormalizable interactions , the hidden sector can be probed at energies soon to be available at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "we consider here a simple case where the hidden sector contains a single complex scalar gauged under an additional @xmath2 to the hypercharge of the sm .",
    "such a @xmath2 factor is ubiquitous in gauge theories as it forms a part of a more complicated gauge group .",
    "thus , we expect the physics we explore in this paper would be generic across a variety of models .",
    "there are two gauge - invariant ( and renormalizable ) ways the @xmath2 gauged hidden sector can communicate with the sm fields .",
    "one is through kinetic mixing between the field strengths of the sm @xmath4 and our hidden sector `` shadow '' @xmath1 . in older constructions",
    "where the extra gauge sector couples directly to the sm fermions , this leads to the well - known @xmath5 physics  @xcite . in the hidden sector context",
    ", there is no direct coupling , and the phenomenological impact of the gauge mixing between @xmath4 and @xmath1 has been studied in  @xcite . the other way is through mixing between the sm higgs with the hidden sector scalar , the `` shadow higgs '' @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we examine the phenomenology of this higgs mixing in a complete model .",
    "motivated by the anticipated start up of lhc , models studying the modifications of the sm higgs signal due to an extended higgs sector uncharged under the sm gauge group have been proposed ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the additional scalars are often constructed to be heavier ( if not very much so ) than the sm higgs to avoid the current bounds from electroweak precision tests ( ewpts ) . but with a hidden sector construction , this need not be so . indeed ,",
    "if the hidden sector scalars are very light ( @xmath7(mev ) ) , they can be candidates for dark matter  @xcite ( under suitable assumptions ) .    with this in mind , we focus in this paper on a special case of the renormalizable model given in  @xcite where it is classically conformal invariant , and the symmetry breaking",
    "is induced radiatively via coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism  @xcite  .",
    "besides its elegance , the occurrence of a small mass scale through cw mechanism is a natural consequence of the conformal symmetry breaking .",
    "this feature precluded the implementation of cw mechanism in a sm context because the prediction of the higgs mass there ( @xmath8  gev ) is far lower than the current lower bound of @xmath9  gev at @xmath10  cl from direct searched at lep2  @xcite .",
    "but in terms of our hidden @xmath1 model with its one extra scalar , the same feature becomes key in ensuring in addition to a sm - like higgs boson , a light shadow higgs , which is not only viable under the current ewpt constraints , it also generates a new signal in the top decays testable at the lhc . in analyzing our model",

    "thus we expect that there is a good chance of detecting the shadow higgs in precision top decay studies such as at the lhc , where @xmath220 events per year are expected at a luminosity of @xmath221  @xcite .    as is the case with the sm higgs search at the lhc , the primary process that can reveal the presence of the shadow higgs is the 3-body decay , @xmath219 , described in fig .",

    "taking @xmath222  gev , @xmath223  gev , @xmath224  gev , and @xmath225 , after a standard but tedious calculation the decay width is evaluated to be @xmath226 for @xmath216  gev respectively .",
    "this is to be compared with the top decay width predicted in the sm  @xcite _ t = ( 1-^2)^2(1 + 2 ^ 2 ) = 1.37 , where @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "suppose that @xmath229  gev , @xmath230 , and the experimental sensitivity can reach down to @xmath231 ( which is expected from the lhc at high luminosity ) , then   suggests that the presence of the shadow higgs can be tested by studying the top decay width .",
    "however , as discussed before , the parameter space for having @xmath230 is small . from fig .",
    "[ subfig : rmzsgs1 ] , we see that for @xmath126  gev , @xmath232 is required , and so the use of perturbation theory becomes questionable . only for @xmath233  gev",
    "can a perturbative @xmath101 be easily maintained . since @xmath116 is more naturally of @xmath234 , a search for the shadow higgs may require the lhc to operate at high luminosity for extended periods of time",
    "we have studied the scale invariant version of a hidden extra @xmath2 model with radiative gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the dimensional transmutation mechanism results in a heavy scalar which we identify as the sm higgs ( @xmath92 ) , and a light scalon which we call the shadow higgs ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "there are no other physical spin-0 particle in the model .    unlike other extended higgs models",
    ", there is no tree level @xmath235 couplings .",
    "thus , the model predicts no additional two body decays for @xmath92 , and to leading order , the sm higgs physics is only modified by a factor of @xmath236 . as for the shadow higgs",
    ", it behaves in general like a lighter version of the sm higgs with couplings to quarks and gauge bosons reduced by a factor of @xmath237 .",
    "phenomenological considerations from lep constraints dictate that @xmath167 for @xmath238  gev .    for a shadow higgs with mass in the range @xmath239  gev ,",

    "stellar cooling imposes the limit of @xmath191 . while not impossible , this stretches the limit of fine tuning . for a cosmologically interesting shadow higgs ,",
    "@xmath242 would be required .",
    "given that the coupling of the shadow higgs to sm particles will be quite weak , the shadow higgs will be elusive to most searches .",
    "however , if its mass is in the range of a few to 100  gev , it can be detected in top decays .",
    "in particular , there will a parallel mode alongside the @xmath243 decay in which the sm - like higgs is replaced by the lighter shadow higgs . if @xmath230 , we expect a branching ratio of @xmath244 for the shadow higgs , which should be detectable at the lhc with high luminosity runs . in the event that the sm - like higgs is heavier than or is too close to @xmath245 so that the decay is kinematically suppressed , the shadow higgs will be the only such decay to be seen .",
