    "the existence of local intersite pairs in cuprate superconductors is inferred from the very short coherence lengths in these materials , which is in turn determined from measurements of @xmath10 . given that the pair dimensions @xmath11 can not exceed the coherence length , i.e. @xmath12 , we may infer that any possible lattice distortions associated with pairing have a finite range , defined by the extent of the pair @xmath13 .",
    "however , the particular form of the electron - phonon interaction leading to these distortions and particular type of phonon mode responsible for pairing should be determined from experiments . according to inelastic neutron scattering data",
    "a large ( 30% ) anomaly in @xmath7 phonon mode corresponding to the ( @xmath14 ) direction has been observed in a number of doped cuprates ( but not in the parent compound)@xcite .",
    "the observed anomaly takes place at an incomensurate wavevector and is suggested to be associated with pairing and/or stripe formation .",
    "the electron phonon interaction can then be written in the form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant describing the strength of coupling , @xmath17defines the wavevector asociated with the interaction and its range in @xmath0-space , while @xmath18 defines its width . in this paper",
    "we analyse the @xmath19 coupling of phonon modes with @xmath1using group theory applicable to la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 and discuss the relevant phonon modes by examining the available experimental data from neutron diffraction , esr and exafs .",
    "we find that the experimentally observed features can be described by the coupling of a @xmath7 - symmetry in - plane o - mode along the @xmath20 direction to holes occupying @xmath6 or @xmath5 - symmetry planar o states .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) corresponding to the tetragonal point group @xmath21 applicable for la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 is shown in figure 1 . to consider local pairs and/or stripes forming along the cu - o bond direction or along 45@xmath22 to it , we need to consider the @xmath20 and the @xmath23 points , corresponding to the ( @xmath24 and ( @xmath25 directions respectively .",
    "the special symmetry points ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 etc . ) give rise to commensurate stripes@xcite .    before proceeding with analysis of the e - p coupling for the case of general @xmath28",
    ", it should be pointed out since the symmetrised cross product of the representations at the @xmath29 point , @xmath30=[e_{g}\\times e_{g}]=a_{1g}+b_{1g}+b_{2g}\\ ] ] the electrons can couple only with @xmath31 modes ( there are no @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the @xmath29 point of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ) .",
    "( there are two such modes in @xmath21 and are associated either with apex oxygen o(2 ) ions or la ions . )",
    "these do not lead to any symmetry breaking .",
    "it follows that stripe formation or further symmetry breaking can not be associated with the @xmath29 point ( @xmath34 , but can only be _ associated with finite _ @xmath35 . for the case of tetragonal symmetry",
    ", this corresponds to the @xmath36 and the @xmath23 points in the bz .",
    "since the @xmath20 and @xmath23 points have a four pronged star , we propose the following form of coupling to electrons in single non - degenerate electronic states : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the site label and @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the 4 wavevectors corresponding to the prongs of the star associated with stripe ( pair ) formation",
    ". we should stress that in this case the nondegenerate electronic states are associated with @xmath41-orbitals of planar oxygens which transform as @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the hamiltonian above on its own does not lead to symmetry breaking , but phase separation can in principle still take place as a result of competition of short - range attraction and long - range coulomb repulsion forces . however , the symmetry of both phases would be the same .",
    "a more interesting case arises when two - fold degenerate levels ( for example the two @xmath5 states corresponding to the planar o @xmath44 and @xmath45 orbitals or the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states of the apical o ) interacts with @xmath46 phonons .",
    "again , we are interested in the phonons which lead to symmetry breaking and allow the formation of stripes .",
    "the invariant form of hamiltonian has a simple form for phonons which transforms as the @xmath7 representations of the group of wave - vector @xmath47 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath6 and @xmath5 representations are real and pauli matrices @xmath48 corresponding to the doublet of @xmath6 or @xmath5 transform as @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) for @xmath51 , @xmath32 ( @xmath52 ) for @xmath53 , @xmath33 ( @xmath54 ) for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 )  for @xmath58representations respectively , we can construct an invariant form of the hamiltonian : @xmath59 where @xmath60    the first term in ( 5 ) describes the symmetric coupling and is identical to the non - degenerate case .",
    "the second and third terms describe the e - p interaction corresponding to the @xmath20 and @xmath23 directions respectively , while the last term describes the _ coupling to spins_.    the proposed interaction ( 5 ) on its own results in splitting of the degenerate states ( a jahn - teller - like effect ) , breaking tetragonal symmetry and resulting in a local orthorhombic distortion .",
    "it can therefore lead to the formation of pairs and stripes with no further interaction .",
    "of course the stability and size of such a distortion will be determined by the balance of short - range attraction and long - range coulomb repulsion@xcite .",
    "to determine the relevant wavevector @xmath40 applicable in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we need to look at the experimental data .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath61 there are no significant phonon anomalies ( in raman or infrared spectroscopies for example ) which can be associated either with @xmath62 or the pseudogap @xmath63",
    ". however , local probe experiments like neutron scattering@xcite , exafs@xcite and esr@xcite give a different picture , and point to the existence of sizeable lattice anomalies for @xmath64 .",
    "the lattice distortions associated with these experimental observations are shown in figure 2 .",
    "particularly the inelastic neutron data ( fig .",
    "2a )  should be singled out here because of the unambiguity of the raw data . in these experiments",
    "a large renormalisation of phonon frequency is ubiquitously observed along the @xmath20 direction in many cuprates , including 214 and 123 structure superconductors , but _ not _ in their parent insulators .",
    "moreover , its temperature dependence clearly suggests a connection with pair formation@xcite .",
    "the phonon @xmath7 modes corresponding to the @xmath20 direction which can couple to the electrons are shown in figure 3 .",
    "one of these , o(1)1 can be clearly identified as the mode observed in neutron scattering experiments @xcite and may thus be indentified as the mode responsible for pairing or stripe formation .",
    "we also note that from the experiments , the width in @xmath0-space of the anomaly is of the same order as the magnitude@xmath65    the interaction given in eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) leads directly to phase segregation of distorted and undistorted domains , where the size of domains is determined by the interplay of short - range attraction and screened coulomb repulsion as already mentioned@xcite .",
    "the incommensurability of the interaction leads to modulation of charge density within the stripe .",
    "importantly since the number of charged carriers in the stripe is less than the number of sites occupied by stripe , we may expect to observe itinerant behaviour in such stripes , i.e. the charge carriers are  not localised within the stripe itself . at low doping when screening is reduced ,",
    "the formation of the stripes of the length 2 ( pairs ) is most probable , while at lower temperatures and higher doping clearly longer stripes are more probable .",
    "these pairs , contrary to the case of the holstein interaction is more extended in space and its size is governed by @xmath40 .",
    "the central idea that the _ pair _ is the ground state entity which defines the extent of the e - p interaction leads to an interaction hamiltonian of degenerate modes with @xmath64 phonons which is suggested to describe the pairing and stripe formation in the cuprates .",
    "the splitting of the degeneracy of planar o orbitals gives rise to a deformation either along the bond axes or along the diagonals , depending on which mode is chosen , but inelastic neutron scattering experiments suggest that the important interaction is along the cu - o bonds , giving rise to an @xmath66 - like form of the interaction as well as coupling to spins via an @xmath56-symmetry term .",
    "remarkably , the interaction which splits the degeneracy of the o states via a jt - like effect is in spirit , if not in detail similar as was originally suggested by bednorz and muller in their original paper on la@xmath2ba@xmath3cuo@xmath4@xcite .",
    "figure 1 . the brillouin zone of the tetragonal structure corresponding to la@xmath67sr@xmath3cuo@xmath68 according to experiment , the @xmath20 directions is of relevance for pairing and stripe formation .",
    "a ) the wavevectors corresponding to the @xmath69representation at the @xmath70point of the point group @xmath21 . note that the relative magnitude of the displacements shown depends on the value of @xmath71 .",
    "b ) the @xmath72 mode corresponding to the distortion suggested in ref . 4 ( fig . 2",
    "b ) can also be viewed as a linear combination of two @xmath73 modes at the @xmath70point with different @xmath0 .",
