    "we examine properties of ultrarelativistic winds from compact objects and we thereby obtain insights into the special case where these winds arise from neutrino heating . our principal motivation for the present study is to determine if physically plausible steady state solutions exist in the ultrarelativistic regime and to determine the relation between neutrino parameters and the character of the outflow .",
    "a peculiar feature of the steady state ultrarelativistic solutions is that the matter temperature near the neutron star surface is cold .",
    "we comment below on whether or not this is physically realizable .",

    "there is a rich literature concerning steady state outflow from neutron stars . in connection with supernovae the neutrino - driven wind occuring several seconds post core",
    "bounce is interesting because it is the favored candidate for the site of the r - process elements @xcite .",
    "the relation between neutrino parameters and the wind have been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "these studies were concerned with gentle , modest entropy winds , characterized by lorentz factors of order unity far from the star . near the neutron star surface",
    "these gentle winds are well approximated as being in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the temperature is set by the competition between neutrino heating and neutrino cooling terms , i.e. , the matter temperature is roughly equal to the temperature characterizing the neutrinos .",
    "apart from effects due to nucleosynthesis , the final electron fraction in these gentle winds is set by the ratio of electron neutrino ( @xmath6 ) and electron anti - neutrino ( @xmath7 ) capture rates on nucleons @xcite .",
    "the general relativistic extension of the wind equations , redshift factors , and neutrino trajectory bending have been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these works also emphasize subrelativistic outflow velocities .",
    "detailed studies of relativistic effects along these lines for r - process nucleosynthesis have been carried out recently by @xcite .    in a pioneering study",
    "@xcite examined ultrarelativistic flow from neutron stars relevant for studies of grb s . in this work",
    "no reference was made to a heating term and , except for photon diffusion which is unimportant near the neutron star surface , the flow was assumed adiabatic .",
    "this work provided a detailed picture of the wind evolution far from the neutron star surface , which is the regime relevant for optical emission in grb s .",
    "there are many similarities between these steady state ultra - relativistic winds and the fireballs discussed in connection with grb s @xcite .",
    "the present study is an attempt to fill the gap between detailed studies of the relation between neutrino heating and sub - relativistic outflow and the study of ultra - relativistic outflow without reference to a heating mechanism .",
    "this is also a detailed look at the ` guts ' of a simple model for a grb central engine",
    ". it may be applicable to the model proposed by @xcite . in this model",
    "binary neutron stars are compressed and heated as gravitational radiation saps orbital kinetic energy during the last seconds of inspiral .",
    "the heating drives copious neutrino loss ( @xmath8 ) which in turn drives a hot pair plasma from the neutron star surface .",
    "lastly , it has recently been argued that the electron fraction in neutrino - heated fireballs may be a clue to neutrino physics at the central engine , and may have observable consequences @xcite .",
    "the present study serves as a `` proof of concept '' of this idea for a simple case .",
    "interestingly , we find that the electron fraction in the wind far from the central engine is set by processes very near the central engine .",

    "we have also introduced @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are respectively the momentum and energy deposition into the plasma per unit time per unit baryon rest mass .",
    "@xmath36 is the mass outflow rate .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics and some algebra allows us to produce from these expressions two more first integrals of the flow : @xmath37    here we have introduced the nucleon mass @xmath38 , the entropy per baryon @xmath39 ( in units of boltzmann s constant ) , and the enthalpy @xmath40 of the plasma . it is useful to have explicit formulas for these quantities :    @xmath41    in this equation @xmath42 is the density in units of @xmath43 .",

    "[ ent ] and [ enth ] we have assumed that the electrons are non - degenerate and that the entropy of light particles dominates the entropy of nucleons ( i.e. @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is relevant for our analysis because we will be concerned principally with conditions near the sonic point , and we will show below that low entropy conditions near the sonic point can not lead to ultrarelativistic flow at infinity .",
    "the quantity h is related to the quantity @xmath46 , the ratio of energy density to rest mass energy density often discussed in connection with grb s , through @xmath47 .",
    "if the flow is to be relativistic at infinity it must either be supersonic at the neutron star surface or pass through a sonic point somewhere above the neutron star . in the present work we focus on the case where",
    "the flow is not already supersonic at the neutron star surface . for the case of nondegenerate electrons and negligible baryon pressure ( @xmath45 )",
    "the equation governing @xmath48 can be written as    @xmath49\\ ] ]    from this equation we see that at the sonic point the following conditions must be satisfied ,    @xmath50    and    @xmath51    in this last equation we have introduced @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the sound speed with the differentiation is taken at constant entropy .",
    "( [ sonic3 ] ) implies that at the sonic point @xmath54 . this is interesting because the change in entropy of the outflowing gas past the sonic point is implicitly given by    @xmath55    here the subscript @xmath39 denotes values at the sonic point and the second to last inequality holds if @xmath56 decreases more rapidly than @xmath57 . when the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) holds , then , the entropy is approximately constant past the sonic point . because the hydrodynamic equations imply that @xmath58 , the inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) also imply that the temperature can not increase substantially past the sonic point for accelerating flow .",
    "this implies that the enthalpy per baryon is roughly constant or decreasing past the sonic point .",
    "we then arrive at the important result that that the final lorentz factor of the wind is not much larger than the value of @xmath59 at the sonic point when the above inequality is satisfied .",
    "( the final lorentz factor of the wind occurs when when the energy in relativistic particles @xmath60 has been converted to baryon kinetic energy . )",
    "this will allow us to make important conclusions regarding the sonic point conditions needed in order that the final flow be relativistic .",
    "we can roughly divide the possible sonic point solutions into two families : those for which the terms involving the heating and momentum deposition terms q and a may be neglected ( family i ) , and those for which these terms are important in determining the conditions at the sonic point ( family ii ) . as we will show that the neutrino energy deposition terms satisfy the inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) when h and @xmath26 increase with radius , only family ii solutions can support steady state ultrarelativistic flow .",
    "an exception to this occurs when the sonic radius is very near 3 m .",
    "previous discussions of steady state winds from neutron stars have focused on family i solutions . for these solutions @xmath61 at the sonic point , and hence the sonic point must be near 3 m in order to produce ultrarelativistic flow in the absence of heating terms @xcite . for neutrino driven wind studies relevant for the r - process",
    "the heating terms are generally not important near the sonic point simply because those flows are subrelativistic or mildly relativistic , so that the sonic point occurs far from the neutron star where neutrino heating has fallen off .    for family ii solutions ( those where heating determines the sonic point conditions and drives the flow relativistic ) some general observations can be made .",
    "if we assume that @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is the schwarzschild radial coordinate of the sonic point and @xmath65 is the initial radial coordinate of the flow , usually taken to be the neutron star radius here ) then the sonic point condition and eq .",
    "[ secondintegral ] imply    @xmath66    in eq .",
    "[ yeff ] we have defined @xmath67 , we have assumed that @xmath68 at the sonic point , and we have neglected the momentum deposition term @xmath69 .",
    ". [ yeff ] serves to specify the position of the sonic radius given a heating term @xmath70 and a velocity profile . if @xmath71 ( which occurs in steady state winds if the heating rate per unit volume drops as @xmath72 ) the sonic point occurs at    @xmath73    which implies that the sonic point occurs near @xmath65 for rapidly dropping heating terms .",
    "again the momentum deposition term @xmath69 has been neglected in this approximation .",
    "another interesting property of these winds is that the temperature does not vary greatly within the sonic radius if @xmath70 is a decreasing function of radius .",
    "this is seen by noting that eqs .",
    "[ firstintegral ] and [ yeff ] imply    @xmath74    which allows us to to define an effective temperature within the sonic point , @xmath75 .",
    "the above equations allow us to extract the properties of ultrarelativistic steady state winds for arbitrary heating functions .",
    "we now turn to the particular case where neutrinos from the central compact object are responsible for the heating .",
    "perhaps the first question raised by a study of steady state neutrino - heated wind solutions is whether or not these winds are physically realizable for conventional compact objects .",
    "there are two parts to this question : i ) whether or not steady state can be achieved ; and ii ) whether or not the flow can be relativistic .",
    "we defer consideration of the second part until later , when we discuss mass ablation from the neutron star surface .",
    "while a hydrodynamic simulation is needed to determine the timescale to achieve steady state in these winds , a rough estimate is that the equilibration timescale is of order the sound crossing time between the sonic radius and the neutron star surface , @xmath76 .",
    "this timescale is short compared to the neutrino diffusion timescale , which is of the order of seconds .",
    "the neutrino diffusion timescale governs the evolutionary timescale of the neutron star unless it undergoes a phase transition or becomes dynamically unstable .",
    "it is known that for most cold neutron star equations of state general relativistic instability sets in for @xmath77 . below this radius",
    "the star becomes dynamically unstable and collapses on a dynamic timescale which is comparable to the equilibration timescale given above .",
    "for these small radius stars , then , it may not be sensible to put much stock in a steady state wind solution .    before describing in some detail properties of the allowed steady state solutions",
    ", we must first examine the neutrino energy deposition terms . to parametrize the neutrinos we make the usual assumption that the neutrinos are emitted from a neutrinosphere with some radius @xmath65 ( in this work we do not make a distinction between neutrinosphere radius and neutron star radius ) and",
    "are characterized at the neutrinosphere by a fermi - dirac black body energy distribution with temperature @xmath44 and zero chemical potential ,    @xmath78    this is a crude approximation to the actual expected energy spectra but suffices to mock - up the energy deposition physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we further make the free streaming approximation , i.e. we neglect the fact that the neutrinos suffer a small depletion with increasing radius owing to interactions with the outflowing plasma .",
    "the facts that real neutron stars are characterized by some small but finite decoupling region over which the neutrino distribution function continues to evolve and that neutrinos from real neutron stars are in general non - thermal or better characterized by degenerate spectra are not important for our arguments . for a discussion of when it is apropriate to treat the neutrino as sharply decoupling from a neutrinosphere see @xcite",
    ".    evaluating @xmath79 for various neutrino plasma interactions is most easily accomplished by noting that liouville s theorem implies that in an inertial frame at rest at some schwarzschild coordinate r the neutrino distribution function is characterized by the red - shifted temperature @xmath80 ( see @xcite ) which also serves to define the redshift factor @xmath81 , and a maximum angle of deviation from the radial direction given by @xmath82    the mass @xmath24 of the neutron star appears in the expresion for @xmath83 because of the bending of null trajectories in the schwarzschild geometry as has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .    in an inertial frame at rest in schwarzschild coordinates , the contribution to @xmath84 from neutrino - antineutrino annihilation is    @xmath85    in the above @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the fermi constant , and hats are used to denote quantities in an inertial frame at rest in the schwarzschild coordinate sytem .",
    "the quantities @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the fermi - integrals of argument zero . the quantity @xmath91 depends on the neutrino species . for @xmath92 annihilation @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the weinberg angle ( @xmath95 ) , while for @xmath96 and @xmath97 annihilation @xmath98 . for simplicity in what follows",
    "we will assume that the luminosity of a single neutrino flavor gives all @xmath99 annihilation heating and that for this flavor the neutrino and antineutrino temperatures are equal , @xmath100 .",
    "we will refer to this single neutrino flavor as @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "this is merely a calculational device designed to reproduce the total heating rate from all neutrino flavors and adjusted accordingly for sensitivity studies .    making a transformation back to schwarzschild coordinates",
    ", we find that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the terms entering the right hand side of the sonic point condition are then    @xmath105    where @xmath106 .",
    "evaluation of the contribution to @xmath107 from neutrino - plasma interactions is complicated by the fact that an inertial observer comoving with the outflowing plasma sees a neutrino distribution function whose temperature varies with direction as @xmath108 .",
    "the effect of this velocity ( and direction ) dependent redshift is to make the neutrino - plasma heating rates small as the outflow velocity becomes large .",
    "we will show that neutrino - antineutrino annihilation is the dominant heating term for the conditions of interest here .",
    "it suffices for us to note that in the limit where @xmath109 , the contributions to @xmath110 from neutrino - electron scattering and neurino capture on baryons are , respectively ,    @xmath111    if @xmath112 , and    @xmath113    note that all of these heating terms satisfy the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) if @xmath59 increases with radius .",
    "neutrino - antineutrino annihilation satisfies eq .",

    "neutrino electron scattering satisfies eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) because @xmath116 neutrino capture on baryons also satisfies this condition because @xmath117 .",
    "these estimates for the scaling of the heating rates with radius neglect the dependence of the heating on the redshift factor @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that the heating rates decrease even more rapidly with increasing radius if the wind is accelerating .",
    "this means that if the final flow is to be ultra - relativistic , we must have @xmath118 at the sonic point , i.e. , either @xmath119 , or ,    @xmath120    for @xmath121 annihilation dominating the heating , or    @xmath122    if electron - neutrino scattering dominates the heating rate , or ,    @xmath123    if neutrino capture on baryons dominates . in eqs .",
    "( [ nunubardom],[nuedom ] , and [ nubdom ] ) the vvalues of all quantities are taken at the sonic point .",
    "unless the sonic radius occurs near @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , the neutrino temperatures needed to drive steady state ultrarelativistic flow imply extraordinary neutrino luminosities .",
    "( for example , consider the cases inherent in eqs .",
    "[ nuedom ] and [ nubdom ] , @xmath126 . ) in what follows we therefore restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath99 annihilation dominates the heating at the sonic point and where only smaller , more realistic , neutrino luminosities are required .",
    "having determined that for modest neutrino luminosities ( @xmath127 ) ultrarelativistic steady state flow only occurs if @xmath121 annihilation heating dominates at the sonic point , we now turn to a discussion of the behavior of these solutions .    for @xmath121 annihilation the heating scales as @xmath128 and the sonic radius is readily estimated .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "1 . from this figure",
    "we see that the sonic radius is generically near @xmath65 .",
    "because @xmath129 decreases rapidly with radius we may approximate @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which implies that the temperature is `` cold '' within the sonic radius so long as thermal neutrino energy losses are unimportant . here",
    "`` cold '' means smaller than the neutrino energy distribution temperatures .",
    "the mass ablation rate for @xmath99 dominated solutions is @xmath132 if @xmath36 is too large the flow can not be relativistic .",
    "this is the `` baryon loading problem '' discussed in connection with grb s .",
    "the relation between @xmath36 and the neutrino heating rates depends in detail on the structure of the compact object atmosphere below , above , and through the neutrinosphere . as argued by @xcite ,",
    "obtaining a sufficiently low @xmath36 may be particularly difficult for @xmath99 energy deposition because this heating rate drops so rapidly with radius .",
    "this requires the density scale height above the neutrinosphere to be small . for type ii supernovae , calculations show that @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the integrated neutrino energy deposition rate @xcite .",
    "this implies that most of the neutrino energy deposition goes into extracting baryons from the gravitational potential well of the neutron star . for supernovae , then , ultra - relativistic winds are not expected unless the early - time density scale height is smaller than expected or the late time neutrino luminosities are larger than expected .",
    "@xcite have argued that the baryon loading problem can not be overcome for mass ejection from strange stars resulting from the phase transition of a cooling or accreting neutron star while @xcite have argued that neutrino heating during the compression of an inspiralling neutron star might lead to ultrarelativistic flow .",
    "the question must be considered for each proposed grb site .",
    "an estimate of @xmath135 allows a simple determination of the influence of neutrino capture on the electron fraction in the outflow . noting that the number of neutrino captures per baryon @xmath136 is approximately given by @xmath137 , where @xmath138 or @xmath7 for neutrino capture on neutrons or protons , gives the total number of neutrino captures per baryon between the neutron star surface and the sonic point @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the entropy at the sonic point and neutron star surface , respectively . with this expression",
    "we can solve for the final electron fraction in the fireball , neglecting @xmath142 capture because of the low plasma temperature .",
    "representive solutions are shown in fig.2 .",
    "this figure serves to illustrate the basic features of how the final electron fraction is set : i ) for low @xmath143 , @xmath5 simply remains what it was in the neutron star .",
    "ii ) as @xmath143 increase , the final @xmath5 tends toward equilibrium with respect to neutrino capture ( i.e. @xmath144 ) , while still retaining some memory of the value of the electron fraction in the neutron star crust .",
    "and iii ) for @xmath145 or @xmath146 @xmath4 , @xmath5 is set ultimately by the competition between @xmath6 and @xmath147 captures .",
    "if the neutrino temperatures are high and neutrinos set the electron fraction in the outflow , the final electron fraction is expected to be low because the neutrinos emitted from a neutron rich star generically satisfy the temperature hierarchy @xmath148 . because neutron star crusts typically have @xmath149 , the electron fraction in the outflow is also expected to be low even when neutrino capture does not set the final electron fraction .",
    "a numerical example of a steady state neutrino heated wind leading to ultrarelativistic flow is shown in fig 3 .",
    "for this example we have taken @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 at the sonic point .",
    "as the wind behavior shown in figure 1 is quite independent of @xmath59 ( except of course for the baryon density which scales trivially with @xmath59 ) as long as @xmath154 a few , we have only shown a single numerical example .",
    "the sonic radius can be chosen to match a particular entropy at the neutron star surface .",
    "increasing @xmath64 increases the entropy at the surface .",
    "the value of the surface entropy is very sensitive to changes in @xmath64 .",
    "numerically , for @xmath64 too large , the scale height for velocity changes becomes very small and the integration fails .",
    "physically , the sonic radius is set by the requirement that the energy flow @xmath155 at the sonic radius equals the net neutrino energy deposition rate interior to the sonic radius .",
    "our plot only extends out to @xmath156 . past",
    "this radius neutrino energy deposition is unimportant and the flow satisfies the simple scaling laws given in @xcite .",
    "the final lorentz factor of the wind is approximately 150 .",
    "we have extended the study of steady state winds from compact objects to include the case where the wind is driven by a heating term and the wind velocity at infinity is ultra - relativistic .",
    "we find that for heating rates per unit volume which drop more rapidly than @xmath157 , the sonic point condition is dominated by the heating and momentum deposition terms , the sonic radius is near the compact object radius , and the temperature within the sonic radius is roughly constant .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the case where the wind is driven principally by neutrino energy deposition . for these winds",
    "neutrino anti - neutrino annihilation dominates the heating unless the neutrino luminosity is very large ( @xmath158 ) .",

    "is the usual subrelativistic solution discussed for supernovae , and on the other their exists a continuum of ultra - relativistic solutions dominated by neutrino heating at the sonic point . of course , the low mass ablation rate needed for the ultra - relativistic solutions may not be compatible with the structure of the atmosphere of the compact object near the neutrinosphere . this needs to be investigated for each compact object .",
    "the way in which the electron fraction is set in the steady state winds we have discussed depends sensitively on the neutrino luminosity , with the number of neutrino captures per baryon varying as the fifth power of the neutrino temperature and depending only logarithmically on the final lorentz factor of the outflow . for high @xmath159 or @xmath7 temperatures",
    "the final electron fraction is set by neutrino capture .",
    "otherwise @xmath5 remembers its value in the neutron star crust . at least for a simple case ,",
    "then , the electron fraction in the outflow is a diagnostic of conditions within the central engine .",
    "this is interesting because _ a priori _ one might guess that the electron fraction comes to equilibrium at @xmath160 , or is always dominated by neutrino capture , as is the case for supernovae .",
    "it is also interesting because recently @xcite it has been argued that neutrinos arising from pion decay in grb fireballs may be detectable .",
    "this neutrino signal depends , along with the other parameters characterizing the fireball , on the electron fraction in the fireball .",
    "if more realistic grb central engine models also leave their finger prints in the electron fraction in the outflow , such a signal might be used to distinguish between central engine models .",
