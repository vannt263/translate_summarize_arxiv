    "most of the important informations on the new phase of quark - gluon matter are obtained by investigating their space - time development in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these studies promise not only to specify the thermodynamical conditions for the opening new phase but also to get useful knowledge of the evolution of the system . the bose - einstein correlations @xcite attract a great deal of attention as a powerful tool to study the geometry of the particle emitting sources .",
    "however , very complicated interactions characteristic of these collisions prevent us from drawing a clear image of the sources .",
    "the coulomb interaction between a frozen out hadron and the strongly interacting charged hadronic matter may also be helpful in studying the evolution of the hadronic matter@xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of studying its effects is that there is no ambiguity in constructing the electromagnetic fields if one knows completely the motion of the hadronic or quark matter .",
    "conversely , if one understands the electromagnetic fields precisely , one can know the behavior of the hadronic or quark matter in the high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "another advantage is that the electromagnetic fields carry information over the whole duration of the nuclear collision ( actually , even of the stage before the collision . ) fortunately , a great number of charged hadrons are produced in the high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is expected that one can obtain information on the electromagnetic fields by carefully studying their momentum distributions .",
    "the importance of the coulomb effect at bevalac energies has been pointed out by several authors@xcite .    the hydrodynamic model @xcite describes the space - time development of the hadronic matter and it can explain various experimental results .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore this model a little further into the problem of the electromagnetic fields due to the expanding charge distribution produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .    in the following ,",
    "we will confine ourselves only to symmetrical collisions such as pb+pb .",
    "the extension to non - symmetrical cases is straightforward .",
    "we will begin by describing in the next section how to compute the number of participant nucleons and their distribution in the transverse plane . in order to study the space - time development of the produced electromagnetic field",
    ", we shall assume a longitudinal scaling solution without transverse expansion for the charged fluid .",
    "we find this will be enough to reproduce the main features of the electromagnetic field in question and moreover , in computing the ratios of the yields ( for instance @xmath2 , possible deviations are largely canceled out . in section i@xmath3i@xmath3i , we give account of how to estimate the net charge distribution inside the fluid along the collision axis .",
    "this will be done by using various experimental results on pb+pb 158 gev / nucleon in the cern - sps .",
    "then , in section i@xmath3v , the electromagnetic field produced by this expanding fluid is computed .",
    "in addition to this , fields by both the incident nuclei and by the penetrating systems consisting of spectator nucleons are also taken into account @xcite , it is not clear the role of the incident nuclei and penetrating systems . ] .",
    "the determination of the freeze - out hypersurface and computation of the transverse - momentum distribution is given in section v. the results obtained are compared with the experimental data for the pionic yield ratio @xmath1 by na44 collaboration @xcite . finally , we close our discussions with some concluding remarks and prediction for the pion yield ratio for au+au collisions at 100 + 100 gev / nucleon .",
    "the participant nucleon number in a nucleus - nucleus collision can be estimated by using the glauber model @xcite . to do this , let s",
    "first consider a @xmath6-@xmath4 collision . at high energy",
    ", one can treat this problem as a collision of @xmath6 with a tube in the nucleus ( see fig.1 ) . here",

    "the probability that @xmath6 interacts with @xmath12 elements in the tube is @xmath13^m[1-\\delta p(\\mbox{\\boldmath{$b$}})]^{n - m}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , we obtain for the total probability of occurrence of inelastic reactions in a @xmath6-@xmath4 collision @xmath14^m[1-\\delta p(\\mbox{\\boldmath{$b$}})]^{n - m}~=1-[~1-\\frac{\\sigma _ { in}}nt(\\mbox{\\boldmath{$b$}})~]^n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the so - called thickness function which is defined as  @xmath16 . in the continuum limit , @xmath17 ,",

    "this means that the total number of participant nucleons in each case is @xmath26353.1 and @xmath26297.7 , respectively .",

    "it is gratifying to see that , when compared with the data ( see @xmath27 in the next section ) , these numbers are almost exact .      in the present work ,",
    "we are mostly interested in central collisions .",
    "so , we shall assume a cylindrically symmetrical distribution both of charge and of fluid density .",
    "however , in comparing the results with the data , we have also to take the experimental conditions into account .",
    "it is clear that the impact parameter is not always zero , but fluctuates from event to event both in modulus and direction . in order to simplify the computation , we shall symmetrize the fluid and charge densities by considering this fluctuation by averaging over @xmath28 furthermore , we assume factorization of these densities with respect to the longitudinal and transverse variables .    let us estimate the transverse profile of this symmetrized nucleon number density . for a given nucleus - nucleus collision ,",

    "they are shown in fig.3 .",
    "we can also define the normalized densities @xmath36 for the fluid , penetrating system and incident nuclei . in the following sections , we assume that the charge distribution in each system is proportional to these quantities .",
    "also , the fluid density will be taken proportional to @xmath37",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we approximate the evolution of the charged matter by a longitudinally expanding scaling solution , neglecting the transverse expansion . the transverse structure has already been discussed in the previous section .",
    "in such a case , the rapidity of the fluid is given by @xmath38 it is convenient to take this and the proper time @xmath39 together with @xmath40 as the coordinates for describing the motion of our charged matter .",
    "thus ,    @xmath41    for the time and the longitudinal coordinate in the center - of - mass frame . strictly speaking",
    ", the scaling solution is only valid if one has an `` infinitely long '' fluid ( @xmath42 ) with an infinitely large size and constant density in the transverse directions .",
    "for a real finite fluid , transverse expansion necessarily appears and also the longitudinal form suffers degradation beginning from the edges . in the present paper , we will neglect these effects , for the sake of simplicity because we find that they are not essential as far as the central region of the collision is concerned .",
    "let us now discuss the longitudinal structure of the charge distribution .",
    "the net charge distribution in the @xmath43-variable ( integrated charge distribution over @xmath40-space ) in the fluid can be estimated in terms of the rapidity distributions of the produced particles @xmath44 it should be noted here that the net charge distribution which we need to know is the one inside the fluid , so we have to estimate @xmath45 soon after the freeze - out , @xmath0 , @xmath46=@xmath47 fm . in this stage ( before the hyperon decays ) , the multiplicity of the negative mesons ( @xmath48 ) is slightly larger than that of the positive mesons ( @xmath49 ) due to the large neutron - proton asymmetry in large stable nuclei whereas no such coulomb - energy effect is expected in the expanding system .",

    "for the present , we shall concentrate on estimating the net charge distribution in the case of 158 gev / nucleon pb+pb collision for the centrality 5% . from these two equations ,",

    "( [ net_charge ] ) and by considering that the existing negative particle data include also @xmath67 finally we arrive at the following expression for the charge distribution of particles at the freeze - out time @xmath68 for pb+pb at 158 gev / nucleon , we have @xmath69= 695@xmath6130  @xcite ( see fig.5 ) .",

    "so , in computing the electromagnetic field in the following section , we took a piece - wise flat rapidity distribution for the fluid net charge as seen in fig.7 which , upon convolution eq.([eq : net - fluid ] ) , approximates as closely as possible the particle distribution of eq.([eq - netcharge ] ) . the normalization constant @xmath83 in eq.([eq : net - fluid ] )",

    ", the net charge distribution strongly depends on the centrality of the collision . in the previous subsection",
    ", we have estimated the net charge distribution by using the na49 data on 158 gev / nucleon pb+pb collision with the centrality 5 % @xcite .",

    "so , we have checked all the trajectories of @xmath187 mesons after leaving the freeze - out surface and excluded those ones which crossed it in , considering them as re - absorbed by the fluid .      using the final results of eq.([coulomb - distorted ] ) which we have just derived ,",
    "we obtain a formula for the pionic yield ratio @xmath189 to compare more precisely our results with the na44 data @xcite for centrality 15% , we introduce the acceptance correction factor @xmath190 to our formula eq.([coulomb - distorted ] ) , which would approximately reproduce the nature of the na44 s detectors : @xmath191 here we neglect the rapidity shift due to the coulomb field .    the results of our calculation together with na44 s data are shown in fig.15 . as seen ,",
    "our results approximately reproduce the data .",
    "we shall now look more carefully into our results in fig.15 .",
    "it is found that our model overestimate in the region @xmath192-@xmath193 5mev and underestimate in the region 10 @xmath194-@xmath195 80  mev",
    ". the underestimation of our model may be improved by introducing a transverse expansion for the charged fluid , because it makes the freeze - out time shorter and then the frozen out particles would feel a stronger electromagnetic field .",
    "another factor which we have neglected in the present calculation , namely the effect of the field before the freeze out , also contributes to correct the results in the right direction .",
    "it has also been suggested by other authors@xcite that @xmath1 ratio has origin in hyperon decays . from @xmath95-decay",
    "should appear as small @xmath196 particles , in the na44 collaboration s setup almost all the hyperons ( with rapidity in the range @xmath197 2@xmath723 ) decay in the first dipole magnet region@xcite .",
    "this means that very few daughter @xmath174 can enter their detector .",
    "so , although we think that this effect should be studied , it is seemingly very small . ]    save particle creation and annihilation , no quantum effect has been considered in the present calculation . due to the uncertainty relation ,",
    "evidently the classical calculation only has meaning if the wave packets are sufficiently small .",
    "this implies that the coulomb effect for small-@xmath196 particles@xcite would be smaller , because such particles would have a large wave packet for a good definition of the momentum and would feel a weaker field , which is an average field over their extension",
    ". this deviation would be larger for @xmath198 than for @xmath199 , because the former is attracted toward the symmetry axis whereas the latter is repelled away .",
    "we also show our result of @xmath188 for the centrality 5% in fig.16 . in this calculation",
    ", the rapidity of the pions is fixed at @xmath200=0.0 and 2.0 and set @xmath201 1 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the structure of the electromagnetic fields which accompany high - energy heavy - ion collisions and computed the coulomb effect for pion spectra caused as a consequence .",
    "we have considered three possible origins of the total electromagnetic field , @xmath202 @xmath203 i )  incident nuclei , ii )  longitudinally expanding charged matter and iii )  penetrating systems which are composed of surviving protons .",
    "glauber model has been used to estimate the number of participant nucleons and to determine the transverse profile of the charged system after the collision .",
    "the centrality dependence of the net - charge is also taken into account . in the description of the space - time evolution of the charged matter ,",
    "a parametrization based on one - dimensional hydrodynamical model has been used , with a constant rapidity @xmath43 .      *",
    "compared with the expanding charged matter , the incident nuclei bring a rather strong electromagnetic field into the interaction region in @xmath204 a few fm . * the na44 pb+pb data on @xmath1 are approximately reproduced by our model ( especially due to the longitudinally expanding fluid part ) .",
    "this means that the longitudinally expanding charged matter plays an important role on the final - state interaction of produced hadrons . * as expected , the penetrating systems seem to be not important for the observables in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "( however , it should be noted that they could have non - negligible contributions in the fragmentation regions . )    in addition to these points , we would like to note that the coulomb effect seen in the yield ratio @xmath1 may depend both on the dumping speed of the electromagnetic field and on the cooling speed of the hadronic matter .",
    "this point leads us further into consideration of the coulomb effect which could be observed in the rhic energies .",
    "one would expect that the strength of coulomb effect may be small , because the fluid takes much time to cool down before the freeze out begins and the net - charge density in mid rapidity region become small at that time . to see this quantitatively , we present the prediction for the coulomb effect in au+au collisions ( centrality 5% ) at 100gev+100gev energy in fig.19 .",
    "the net - charge distribution and the fluid distribution used in this calculation are shown in fig.17 and fig.18 , respectively .",
    "for the net - charge distribution , we assume that the total net charge and width of ` shoulders ' at large @xmath205 regions is to be the same as that of sps case by using a somewhat different net charge distribution , @xmath206 10 , for the central region .",
    "however , no considerable difference was obtained.].the total number of pions in the rhic energy in fig.18 is determined by the energy conservation law for the total system . as shown in fig.19 , the enhancement of @xmath207 is seen at very small @xmath192 -@xmath208 region only .",
    "as remarked in section v@xmath3i , there remained some open questions : effect of the transverse expansion , charge redistribution inside the fluid , introduction of the resonance decays and the effect of the uncertainty relation .",
    "these questions are presently under investigation .",
