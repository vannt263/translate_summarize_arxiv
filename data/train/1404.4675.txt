    "the concept of quantum random cipher was proposed by h. p. yuen and implemented through phase shift keying ( psk ) modulation @xcite and intensity modulation ( i m ) @xcite , which are called @xmath0 system or y00 system .",
    "these systems enable us to realize high speed direct data transmission with security protected by physical phenomena .",
    "moreover he gave another implementation of quantum random cipher by using coherent pulse position modulation ( cppm ) and shown that @xmath1-ary detection can overcome the limitation on the binary detection advantage of optimal quantum receiver for psk or i m signal states @xcite .",
    "this brings a new scheme for both key generation and direct encryption .",
    "the cppm system has a set of pulse position modulation ( ppm ) signals latexmath:[\\[\\label{phi tensor }    for @xmath1 messages .",
    "the state @xmath3 is encrypted to a cppm signal @xmath4 randomly chosen by a running key @xmath5 generated from the pseudo random number generator ( prng ) on the secret shared key .",
    "the cppm system can be realized physically by at least @xmath1-beam splitters @xcite , and it is generally represented by symplectic transformations for multi mode gaussian states @xcite .",
    "a defect of this system is that it does not have scalability in the implementation . since loss at beam splitters has a serious effect on the system , it is almost impossible to implement the system with enough security .",
    "so we need to find a more feasible method of encryption . in order to meet this requirement ,",
    "yuen proposed another type of encryption @xcite , where a phase mask is employed in order to implement the unitary operator @xmath6 . the phase mask can be easily realized by the liquid crystal modulator ( lcm ) or the acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) . in shannon theory for the symmetric key cipher ,",
    "the information theoretic security against ciphertext only attack on data has the limit @xmath7 where the plaintext , the corresponding ciphertext and the secret key are denoted by the random variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "this is called shannon limit for the symmetric key cipher . in the context of random cipher",
    ", we can exceed this limit .",
    "still the necessary and sufficient condition for exceeding the limit is not clear , but if the following relation holds , we can say that the cipher exceeds the shannon limit @xmath11 where the ciphertext of the legitimate receiver ( bob ) and that of the eavesdropper ( eve ) are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "this means that eve can not pin down the information bit even if she gets a secret key after measurement of the ciphertext while bob can do it .",
    "we showed that the cppm system with the encryption ( [ cppm encryption ] ) has such a property @xcite . in this paper",
    "we clarify that our random cipher also has it . for this purpose",
    "we evaluate eve s symbol error probability @xmath14 under the assumption that eve can know the secret key after obtaining an electrical signal by her measurement .",
    "we give a more precise evaluation of @xmath14 than in @xcite , and obtain a lower bound of exponent @xmath15 characterizing @xmath14 .",
    "this enables us to show `` strong converse to the coding theorem '' @xcite for eve s channel .",
    "our interest is devoted to direct encryption in particular , but our discussions can be also applied to security analysis of key generation system .",
    "in particular the exponent @xmath15 plays an important role in the latter case @xcite .",
    "this paper gives a general formulation of phase mask encryption by symplectic transformations for quantum gaussian waveforms and presents a method for analyzing the eve s symbol error probability .",
    "it is organized as follows : in section [ sec .",
    "2 ] we overview the quantum random cipher and results about error probabilities of bob .",
    "in addition we represent the ppm signals in terms of quantum gaussian waveform as a preparation for considering the phase mask encryption in the next section . in section [ sec cannonical ]",
    "we formulate the phase mask encryption basing on the general theory of gaussian state developed by holevo @xcite . in section [ sec .",
    "4 ] the security of the proposed system is evaluated by analyzing a symbol error probability of eve .",
    "we briefly explain a configuration of quantum random cipher ( fig .",
    "[ config system ] ) . the sender(alice ) modulates her classical message @xmath16 to obtain a signal state @xmath17 .",
    "then the signal state is transformed into an encrypted state @xmath18 by a unitary operator @xmath6 , which is randomly chosen via a running key @xmath5 generated by using prng on a secret key * k*. we assume the encrypted state @xmath18 is sent through the ideal channel . since the secret key * k * , prng and map @xmath19",
    "are shared by alice and bob , bob can apply the unitary operator @xmath20 to the received state @xmath18 and obtains the signal state @xmath17 .",
    "thus bob can receive a classical message @xmath21 with a very small error by applying the optimum detection to @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , eve does not know the secret key * k * and hence she must detect encrypted state @xmath18 directly .",
    "this makes eve s symbol error probability worse than bob s one . in the quantum random cipher , a ciphertext",
    "is protected against eve s attack by a quantum noise .",
    "this enables fresh key generation by communication or information theoretic security against known plaintext attack in the symmetric key cipher .",
    "so evaluation of eves s symbol error probability is essential for security analysis of quantum random cipher .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath22 is given by the ppm signal @xmath23 and each mode in eq .",
    "( [ phi tensor ] ) is from a different time segment .",
    "the ppm signals are quantum analog of orthogonal signals in classical communication theory , and error probabilities given by detections for them are summarized in @xcite .",
    "when the optimum receiver is used , the symbol error probability is @xcite @xmath24^{1/2}-(1-e^{-s})^{1/2 } \\}^2.\\ ] ] when the photon counting receiver is used , the symbol error probability is @xmath25 where error occurs when no photons are found in any of the modes .",
    "let the signals be transmitted every @xmath26 seconds .",
    "the signal power is @xmath27 with an oscillator frequency @xmath28 and the rate is @xmath29 [ ebits / sec ]",
    ". then it is found that for fixed any values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "this means that the capacity has an infinite value in both cases . on the other hand , the quasi - classical(homodyne ) receiver , can not achieve an infinite capacity @xcite .",
    "as clarified later , eve s optimum receiver is of such a type , and the capacity takes a finite value .",
    "this implies that we can make eve s symbol error probability close to @xmath35 with keeping @xmath36 or @xmath37 close to @xmath38 .",
    "the estimation of eve s symbol error probability is shown in section [ sec . 4 ] .      in order to describe the unitary operator @xmath6 in section [ sec cannonical ] , we summarize the description of the electromagnetic field generated by a signal source . for simplicity",

    "<S> the security analysis of physical encryption protocol based on coherent pulse position modulation(cppm ) originated by yuen is one of the most interesting topics in the study of cryptosystem with a security level beyond the shannon limit . </S>",

    "<S> then we assume the secret key is given to eve after her heterodyne measurement . since this assumption means that eve has a great advantage in the sense of the conventional cryptography , the lower bound of her error indeed ensures the security level beyond the shannon limit . </S>",
