    "convection is likely to be the most efficient energy transport mechanism at these depths , which is not consider in this paper ( see discussion in section [ radiative ] ) , therefore we do not consider our results below @xmath461 bar reliable . note that our radiative models give similar results as observations and models by other groups ( see section [ validating ] ) , even at higher pressures .",
    "chemical kinetics timescales required to maintain the species in equilibrium with each other are shorter than vertical mixing for high temperatures and pressures .",
    "therefore , chemical equilibrium is reached faster at high pressures , deep in the atmosphere of these gaseous planets .",
    "chemical disequilibrium dominates the upper atmosphere of highly irradiated planets , where densities are low and disequilibrium processes have shorter timescales .",
    "furthermore , in highly irradiated atmospheres stellar uv radiation photodissociate molecules in the upper atmosphere , causing escape and recombination of atoms .      in order to study the effect of stellar flux alone on photochemical mixing ratios in the atmosphere , we performed simulations using the same thermal profile and vertical mixing , but adopting different stellar fluxes .",
    "figure [ sametp ] shows the mixing ratios of different species as a function of pressure for planets with the same thermal structure and eddy coefficient ( k@xmath74 ) , but different stellar fluxes . for the thermal structure",
    ", we use the temperature - pressure profile of a planet located at 0.025 au of a k star as an example ( row 3 , column 3 in figure [ grid - t ] ) , the stellar fluxes are the same adopted in the grid calculations .",
    "the different photochemical mixing ratios found in each case are shown in different colors in figure [ sametp ] , orange ( f star ) , red ( g star ) , brown ( k star ) and black ( m star ) . h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 are the species most affected by the stellar uv flux and the resulting photochemistry .",
    "the effect of vertical mixing and photochemistry compete in the atmosphere . here",
    "we investigate the effects of photodissociation , the effect of vertical mixing is explored in section [ eddy ] . as expected , at lower pressures in the atmosphere ( p@xmath75 bars )",
    "photolysis has shorter timescales than vertical mixing and its effects are even larger when the planet is irradiated by a higher uv flux and therefore mixing ratios change when going from an m to an f star .",
    "when larger amount of photons are irradiating the atmosphere , they reach lower altitudes , and therefore dissociation starts at higher pressures .",
    "dissociation of h@xmath2o starts at @xmath37 bars when the planet is irradiated by an f star and at @xmath48 bars for an m star case .",
    "the differences are even larger for methane , which starts to dissociate at 0.01 bars for the f star case and at @xmath48 bars for the m star .",
    "ch@xmath1 dissociates creating ch@xmath27 , h and ch@xmath2 and h , therefore methane dissociation creates h. large amounts of h are also created due to water photolysis .",
    "dissociation of h@xmath2o also creates oh , which reacts with h@xmath2 , destroying it .",
    "this effect is important in the upper atmosphere , with a h@xmath2 mixing ratio of @xmath58 for a planet irradiated by an f star and close to 1 for a planet irradiated by an m star at @xmath76 bars . due to this effect ,",
    "the ratio of h to h@xmath2 is higher when going from low to high uv stellar emission ( i.e. from m to f stars ) .",
    "co combines with oh ( product of h@xmath2o dissociation ) , forming co@xmath2 , that has a local maximum when this happens , at the pressure where water starts to dissociate , then it decreases due to its own dissociation reaching lower mixing ratios for the case of the planet irradiated by the f star .",
    "another effect of water dissociation is the production of o by the reaction between h and oh , which reaches higher mixing ratios in the atmosphere , reaching a mixing ratio close to @xmath43 at different pressures , according to the pressure levels where water starts to dissociate in the atmosphere .",
    "water photolysis dominates the chemistry in the upper atmosphere , being the effects larger when going from the m to the f star . in summary ,",
    "high stellar uv flux ( e.g. f star ) leads to increase of mixing ratios of h , oh and o , a small increase in co@xmath2 and the destruction of h@xmath2 . for planets around stars with low uv fluxes ( e.g. inactive m stars ) h@xmath2 ,",
    "h , h@xmath2o , co and ch@xmath1 are the most abundant chemicals in the observable part of the planet s atmosphere .      the volume mixing ratios of the major gases in the atmosphere as a function of pressure in the grid are shown in figure [ grid - photo ] , where the stellar types of the host star and semimajor axis of the planets are shown on the right and top of the grid , respectively . in this",
    "figures , different colors show the major chemical species in dotted lines when they are driven by equilibrium chemistry only and in solid lines when disequilibrium chemistry is also taken into account .",
    "as expected at high temperatures and pressures , equilibrium mixing ratios for all species are maintained in the atmosphere ( below @xmath461 bar ) .",
    "equilibrium levels can be maintained even at lower pressures ( p@xmath77 bars ) for the hottest planet around inactive m stars , due to low uv flux emission .",
    "it is also shown in the models of the hottest planets in our grid ( with equilibrium temperatures close to 2800 k ) , where the mixing ratios of all chemical species are close to the equilibrium .",
    "this is expected because equilibrium is reached faster at high temperatures and pressures , where the chemical equilibrium timescales ( @xmath78 ) are shorter than disequilibrium processes ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "cooler temperatures and low pressures favor disequilibrium ( @xmath80 ) , which is relevant for high altitudes in the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , the quench level where @xmath81 , is a function of the temperature , pressure and vertical mixing and will not occur at the same temperature and pressure for all chemical species , because it depends on the time scale for the fastest reactions that produce and destroy the molecule @xcite .",
    "for example , methane departs from equilibrium deeper in the atmosphere than any other chemical species in our models for all the planets of our grid .",
    "as seen in figure [ sametp ] , high in the atmosphere the uv photons coming from the star are absorbed and the resulting photochemistry dominates the chemical composition of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "one of the main effects is the production of large amounts of h and oh due to the photolysis of h@xmath2o , followed by a destruction of molecular hydrogen due to its reaction with the produced oh ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , while large amounts of h are created , h@xmath2 is destroyed and replaced by h as the main atmospheric species high in the atmosphere .",
    "this effect is larger when the photolysis of h@xmath2o is larger .",
    "therefore , as seen in figure [ grid - photo ] , there is more h and less h@xmath2 when the planets are closer to the star , being exposed to more uv radiation .",
    "co is the dominant carbon compound in all the planetary atmospheres in the grid .",
    "its abundance is set by thermochemical equilibrium , except high in the atmosphere ( p@xmath77 ) where it has a local maximum product of water photolysis , except for the hottest planets in our grid , where equilibrium chemistry dominates even at low pressures .",
    "methane is more stable at lower temperatures and therefore its abundance increases when going from hot to cooler planets in the grid .",
    "in addition , looking at planets with the same semimajor axis but orbiting different stellar types , ch@xmath1 abundance increases also with decreasing stellar temperature , dominated by the effects of decreasing stellar uv .",
    "methane is less efficiently recycled and therefore , even more affected by photodissociation .",
    "ch@xmath1 is not present in significant amounts high in the atmosphere ( above @xmath43 bars ) in the planets in our grid , with the exception of the cool planets around the m star , which are exposed to very low uv radiation and are cool enough to maintain a large abundance of methane in the atmosphere .",
    "the other exceptions to this are the cases of a higher vertical mixing in the atmosphere ( see section [ eddy ] ) .    as seen in figure [ grid - photo ] , the mixing ratio of atomic o increases at high altitudes in all models , due to its production through water photolysis in the atmosphere .",
    "atomic oxygen is also lost due to the backwards reaction , but can be transported up to very low pressures , where it is distributed over large radial distances due to hydrodynamic winds and other processes present in the thermosphere , as explained by several authors ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "low planetary temperatures ( e.g. for large orbital distances ) show an increase of ch@xmath1 . for hot planets ( e.g. with small orbital distances ) h , h@xmath2 and co are the most abundant chemicals in the observable part of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "figures [ photo - comparacion ] , [ photo - hd97658b ] and [ grid - photo ] show the comparison between models that use equilibrium ( dotted lines ) vs. non equilibrium ( solid lines ) chemical processes in exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "the chemistry in mini - neptune and giant exoplanet atmospheres is driven by disequilibrium processes ( vertical mixing , photochemistry , molecular diffusion ) for all planets with temperatures ( t @xmath82 2500k ) in our grid , with differences of several orders of magnitude to the corresponding equilibrium chemistry calculations .",
    "this occurs at pressures of p@xmath82 10 bars , for all the planets in our grid including the known exoplanets hd189733b , xo-1b , corot-2b ( figures [ hd189733b ] , [ xo-1b ] , [ corot-2b ] ) and hd 97658b ( figure [ photo - hd97658b ] ) , except for the hottest planets with t @xmath40 2500k , where the entire atmosphere is dominated by equilibrium chemistry : the planet at 0.015 au around an g star , the planet at 0.025au around an f star .",
    "wasp-12b is dominated by equilibrium chemistry for p<0.001 bars ( figure [ wasp-12b ] ) .",
    "equilibrium chemistry dominates deeper regions ( p@xmath83 10 bars ) for all planets modeled .",
    "only regions with p@xmath82 10 bars are observed remotely , therefore , we can not ignore the effects of disequilibrium chemistry when exploring the observable species in these exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "figure [ grid - photo ] shows that for all planets in the grid disequilibrium chemistry lowers the abundance of h@xmath2 , h@xmath2o and co and increases the abundance of ch@xmath1 , h , o and oh in the planet s atmosphere .",
    "ignoring disequilibrium chemistry would severely overestimate the abundance of h and h@xmath2o and underestimate the abundance of ch@xmath1 ( for the intermediate atmosphere , it is dissociated in the upper atmosphere ) , h , o and oh in the observable pressure region for planets with t @xmath82 2500k .    figures [ photo - comparacion ] and [ photo - hd97658b ] show that using equilibrium chemistry only would overestimate the abundance of h@xmath2 , h@xmath2o and co for the know exoplanets hd 189733b , xo-1b , corot-2b , wasp-12b and hd 97658b .",
    "note that the effects are smaller for wasp-12b because it is a hotter planet with a t@xmath84 of 2577 k ( for a=0.01 ) .",
    "especially the abundance of ch@xmath1 , h@xmath2o , h and h@xmath2 are critically dependent on disequilibrium chemistry as shown in figures [ photo - comparacion ] and [ photo - hd97658b ] .",
    "here we discuss some model parameters that influence our results , vertical mixing in section [ eddy ] , clouds and hazes in section [ clouds ] , our assumption of radiative profile in section [ radiative ] and elemental abundances in section [ discussion : clouds ] .",
    "the eddy diffusion coefficient is included in 1d photochemical models @xcite , to represent the vertical mixing processes that occur in planetary atmospheres .",
    "this coefficient is hard to determine observationally or through experiments .",
    "some authors use it as a free parameter ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "others , adopt a coefficient proportional to a globally averaged wind profile from gcm s results , where the proportional factor is the scale height @xcite . in a recent paper , @xcite compared 1d and 3d models and derived a @xmath29 value that represents the averaged tracer profiles for hd 209458b .",
    "these recent results are two orders of magnitude smaller than previous ones obtained using the root mean square of the vertical velocity .",
    "these new results suggest that mixing in hot - jupiter atmospheres is potentially not as strong as previously thought .",
    "however , these estimates are an approximation from gcm models calculated for one specific planet and can not be taken as a general result for other planets .    given the uncertainty of @xmath29 , we model two extreme and one intermediate value here in order to explore the degeneracies in the abundance of observable species on this parameter .",
    "following @xcite we choose two extreme values that are the minimum and maximum values derived in their parametrization and one intermediate value : @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "figure [ grid - eddy ] shows the influence of the eddy diffusion coefficient on the volume mixing ratios as a function of pressure for four planets in our grid located at 0.01 , 0.015 , 0.025 and 0.05 au from a k star .",
    "figure [ grid - eddy ] shows semimajor axis at the top and the @xmath29 values on the right side .",
    "figure [ grid - eddy ] shows that the pressure where the quenched level is reached depends on the vertical mixing .",
    "strong mixing in the atmosphere implies that molecules like co and ch@xmath1 will be quenched at higher pressures , deeper in the atmosphere , than for weaker vertical mixing .",
    "co@xmath2 shows the same behavior for semimajor axis of 0.025 and 0.05 au.the effects of vertical mixing on the mixing ratios of co and ch@xmath1 was also studied by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the abundance of co in the atmosphere of gliese 229b and ch@xmath1 in hd 189733b and found similar results .",
    "in the all cases shown in figure [ grid - eddy ] , the mixing is efficient enough to maintain the concentrations of the species well mixed very deep in the atmosphere , where the equilibrium chemistry dominates .",
    "two effects dominate disequilibrium chemistry at high altitudes : vertical mixing and dissociation driven by the uv flux received from the star .",
    "photodissociation of atmospheric molecules due to absorption of energetic photons maintains chemical disequilibrium within the atmosphere , but fast reaction rates in a well mixed atmosphere enable recombination of the molecules split apart by photochemistry .",
    "therefore photochemistry becomes relevant at low pressures in the atmosphere , and it is more efficient when vertical mixing is weak .",
    "figure [ grid - eddy ] shows that for @xmath86 to @xmath87 ( from stronger to weaker vertical mixing ) dissociation becomes more efficient .",
    "therefore , some molecules that would dissociate at relatively low pressures for a small eddy coefficient , will dissociate at even lower pressures when the mixing is stronger in the atmosphere , becoming one of the major species in the upper atmosphere , like ch@xmath1 for planets located at 0.025 and 0.05 au .",
    "figure [ grid - eddy ] shows that ch@xmath1 is photodissociated at @xmath57 bars for @xmath87 , but has a mixing ratio higher than co for the same pressure for @xmath86 , showing that the temperature ( due to its semimajor axis ) is only one of the relevant factors when determining major observable constituents in an exoplanet s atmosphere .",
    "co@xmath2 and h@xmath2o also show this behavior .",
    "a higher dissociation of h@xmath2o molecules implies less h@xmath2 and more h in the atmosphere , what is shown in fig .",
    "[ grid - eddy ] when going from stronger to weaker eddy diffusion coefficients .",
    "h@xmath2 is the major gas in the atmosphere for @xmath86 .",
    "h becomes the dominant gas for @xmath87 , which could be relevant for atmospheric escape studies in hot exoplanets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore quantitative measurements from observations of these gases in the atmospheres of hot extrasolar giant planets and mini - neptunes are needed to constrain the value of the vertical mixing in hot exoplanets atmospheres .",
    "we do not consider the existence of atmospheric condensates in our models .",
    "the presence of clouds and atmospheric hazes can lead to variations in the opacities , that can alter the thermal profile in the atmosphere .",
    "the presence of clouds were inferred for kepler-7b @xcite and observations made with the _ spitzer _ space telescope of the dayside atmospheres of some hot - jupiters that presented an excess of emission that was interpretated as thermal inversions in the atmosphere ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we do not include thermal inversions in the temperature and profiles presented , in order to limit the number of free parameters we explore in this paper .",
    "an exploration of possible inversions in these exoplanet atmospheres will be address in a future paper .",
    "our assumption of a pure radiative model in planets with an extended hydrogen and helium atmosphere is supported by models by several groups @xcite , which show that highly irradiated hot - jupiters present an extended radiative layer .",
    "note that models by @xcite , showed that in some cases , the night side of planets might have a convective layer even at low optical depths .",
    "hotter planets may also exhibit weaker global energy redistribution giving them stronger day / night temperature contrasts ( e.g.,@xcite ) , not considered in our model grid .",
    "the atmospheric elemental abundances of hot exoplanets may differ from that of their host stars .",
    "it is an unknown and therefore another parameter to explore using atmospheric models .",
    "recent studies have suggested that lower - mass planets may also have atmospheres highly enriched in heavy elements @xcite , which is a plausible explanation to the apparent co - rich , ch@xmath1-poor nature of gj 436b @xcite .",
    "high c / o ratios were suggested in order to explain the abundances detected in wasp-12b @xcite , while studies by @xcite show that there is no evidence for c / o@xmath88 in wasp-12b atmosphere .",
    "@xcite , also explored a range of different c / o ratios ( @xmath89c / o@xmath90 ) on the atmospheric composition of three exoplanets : corot-2b , xo-1b and hd 189733b , finding the first two consistent with the assumption of high c / o ratios , and hd 189733b consistent with a c / o@xmath91 .",
    "these results show that the elemental abundances expected for hot exoplanets is so far not known .    in this paper we focussed on the influence of semimajor axis , stellar flux and vertical mixing on the atmospheric models of gas planets .",
    "to limit the parameter space to explore , we adopted solar elemental abundances in the atmospheres .",
    "the atmospheric composition and possible deviations of the elemental abundances from solar values on the grid will be explored in a future paper .",
    "in this paper we present a grid that links astrophysical observable data ( orbital distance and effective stellar temperature ) with the atmospheric composition expected in hot - exoplanet atmospheres . the thermal and photochemical atmospheric grid presented in this paper",
    "can be applied to current and future planetary observations to inform what observable atmospheric species are expected for h - dominated exoplanet s atmospheres with 700 @xmath312800 k.    we explored the effect of temperature and uv flux linking them to observables like semimajor axis and stellar type in the composition of hot and cool mini - neptune and giant planet atmospheres models .",
    "we used a one dimensional climate and photochemical code to study these effects for five known extrasolar planets ( hd97658b , hd 189733b , xo-1b , corot-2b and wasp-12b ) as well as provide a grid of planets from 2800 k @xmath67 @xmath92700 k.    we build a grid of planets with different temperatures assuming an albedo of 0.01 , calculated based on their semimajor axis ( 0.01 , 0.015 , 0.025 , 0.05 and 0.1 au ) , for a grid of inactive m , k , g and f main sequence stars ( t@xmath333800 , 5000 , 6000 and 7000 k , respectively ) .",
    "the different semimajor axis dominate thermal profiles of the planets while the stellar spectral energy distribution affects the photochemistry of the atmospheres due to uv radiation received by the planet .",
    "we found that the atmospheres of the hottest planets in the grid are dominated by h , h@xmath2 , o , h@xmath2o and co , with the last one being the major carbon compound species for all the planets in the grid .",
    "for the cooler planets other gases like ch@xmath1 become dominant , due to the fact that methane is more stable at lower temperatures .",
    "different stellar spectral types supply different levels of uv flux , going from low flux for the inactive m star ( @xmath93 photons / s/@xmath94/@xmath95 for 1500 ) to high uv flux for the f star ( @xmath96 photons / s/@xmath94/@xmath95for 1500 ) .",
    "this in turn affects the photochemistry in a planet s atmosphere due to the dissociation of molecules occurring down to higher pressure when going from m to f stars .",
    "our results show that ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o are the most sensitive species to uv flux , and this in turn affects the mixing ratios of other major observable species like co@xmath2 , h , h@xmath2 , oh , having a higher photolysis rate , and therefore a lower mixing ratio for pressures p@xmath97 bars for planets orbiting an f star than an m star . as a result of the photolysis of h@xmath2o , and the subsequent destruction of h@xmath2 in the reaction with oh , large amounts of h are produced , which replaces h@xmath2 as the major gas in the atmosphere , for planets receiving high uv radiation .",
    "this effect is important when the photolysis of h@xmath2o is large and therefore is higher when going from m to f host stars .",
    "vertical mixing is important in exoplanet atmospheres , since different possible values change the mixing ratios of observable gases in the atmospheres . mixing ratio of ch@xmath1 is indicative of the effect of vertical mixing and therefore departure of equilibrium in the atmosphere , specially for pressures close to 1 bar .",
    "when looking at lower pressures ( @xmath98p@xmath99bars ) , other species , like h@xmath2o , h , h@xmath2 or co@xmath2 also indicate the efficiency of vertical mixing in the atmosphere , with larger mixing ratios for stronger mixing in the planet s atmosphere .",
    "dissociation becomes less efficient when going from weak to strong vertical mixing in the atmosphere , which affects the observable atmospheric abundances of most of the species .",
    "measurements of these gases abundance for short orbital period exoplanets can be used to explore and constrain vertical mixing in these atmospheres .",

    "<S> we calculated an atmospheric grid for hot mini - neptune and giant exoplanets , that links astrophysical observable parameters- orbital distance and stellar type- with the chemical atmospheric species expected . the grid can be applied to current and future observations to characterize exoplanet atmospheres and serves as a reference to interpret atmospheric retrieval analysis results . to build the grid </S>",
    "<S> , we developed a 1d code for calculating the atmospheric thermal structure and link it to a photochemical model that includes disequilibrium chemistry ( molecular diffusion , vertical mixing and photochemistry ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare thermal profiles and atmospheric composition of planets at different semimajor axis ( 0.01@xmath0a@xmath00.1au ) orbiting f , g , k and m stars . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and uv flux affect chemical species in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we explore which effects are due to temperature and which due to stellar characteristics , showing the species most affected in each case . ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o are the most sensitive to uv flux , h displaces h@xmath2 as the most abundant gas in the upper atmosphere for planets receiving a high uv flux . </S>",
    "<S> ch@xmath1 is more abundant for cooler planets . </S>",
    "<S> we explore vertical mixing , to inform degeneracies on our models and in the resulting spectral observables . for lower pressures observable species like h@xmath2o or co@xmath2 can indicate the efficiency of vertical mixing , with larger mixing ratios for a stronger mixing . by establishing the grid , testing the sensitivity of the results and comparing our model to published results , </S>",
    "<S> our paper provides a tool to estimate what observations could yield . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our model to wasp-12b , corot-2b , xo-1b , hd189733b and hd97658b . </S>"
