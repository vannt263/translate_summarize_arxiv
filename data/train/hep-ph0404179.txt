    "we remark that the same calculation with a time - like vector @xmath53 and a quark separation @xmath43 oriented orthogonally to @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 gives the well - known result that the expectation value of the loop equals unity as has been shown in the original references on high energy scattering . in the formulation of high energy scattering @xcite with the correlation function summed to all orders in the s - matrix the respective phase factors from single loops totally cancel .",

    "for very fast quarks the mass term and transverse momenta are negligible compared with the energy and longitudinal momentum . in this eikonal approximation the dirac equation of the leading component decouples from the small component :              terms involving transverse momenta and masses of the same order @xmath63 are not included in the loop as it has been calculated .",
    "two of these terms give the standard kinetic energy term of free particles , which contributes to the total light - cone energy .",
    "terms with spin can not be obtained from the straight wilson loop and are not discussed here .",
    "we introduce the relative @xmath64 momentum @xmath65 and transverse momentum @xmath66 for the quarks with mass @xmath67 . by adding the above `` potential '' term to the kinetic term of relative motion of the two particles we complete our approximate derivation of the light - cone energy @xmath68      to derive the light - cone hamiltonian we multiply @xmath68 with the plus component of the light - cone momentum @xmath62 and use that @xmath69 to eliminate the boost variable from the hamiltonian .",
    "further we follow the notation of reference @xcite and introduce the fraction @xmath70 with @xmath71 and its conjugate the scaled longitudinal space coordinate @xmath72 as dynamical variables . for our configuration the relative time of the quark and antiquark is zero      we have obtained the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath73 from the confining interaction in a lorentz invariant manner , because the variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 are invariant under boosts .",
    "the valence quark light - cone hamiltonian has a simple confining potential .",
    "the magnitude of the confining potential is set by the string tension @xmath76 .",
    "the effective `` distance '' of the quarks is given by scale - free light - cone longitudinal distance and the transverse distance multiplied by the bound state mass .",
    "the above equation agrees in the limit of one - dimensional motion with the equation for the yo - yo string derived in ref .",
    "if there is only transverse motion @xmath77 , the confinement has the usual form which is seen by using @xmath78 . to solve the @xmath73 operator",
    "one can go over to @xmath79 . minimizing @xmath79 with respect to @xmath80 one can replace the square root operator .",
    "final self consistency must be reached with a guessed mass eigenvalue @xmath81              the relative weight of non - perturbative non - abelian and abelian contribution is fixed by @xmath82 in the parametrization of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "we have used @xmath76 to parametrize also the abelian non - confining potential , instead of giving the full expression with the gluon condensate .",
    "of course , the abelian part of the potential does not confine . the best way to find",
    "the two - body wave function is to keep @xmath83 in the momentum representation and the transverse direction in configuration space @xmath75 .",
    "it is to be expected that in this approximation the pion mass is not described correctly .",
    "firstly , the spin structure of the meson is not reflected in the spin independent expression above . secondly , one expects quark self energy corrections @xcite .",
    "the typical mass scale of a meson estimated from a trial solution with a wave function @xmath84 comes out to be 1 gev .",
    "the problem of the pion has to be addressed separately , since on the light - cone the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking needs special care and is of particular interest . in the approach above confinement",
    "plays an important role in contrast to nambu - jona - lasinio effective models which give an adequate description of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking but do not include confinement .",
    "the confining interaction in the light - cone hamiltonian was derived in the specific model of the stochastic vacuum .",
    "but it also can be inferred from the simple lorentz transformation properties of the phase in the wilson loop and a lattice determination of the tilted wilson expectation values . in this respect",
    "the final hamiltonian is model independent .",
    "the inclusion of confining forces in the initial and final state wave functions can put all scattering cross sections calculated with the stochastic vacuum model on a much safer base since wave functions and cross section are derived consistently . for low @xmath85 the long distance part of the photon wave function matters strongly and confinement is important cf .",
    "especially the diffractive cross section has a sizeable contribution from large dipole sizes and a correct behaviour can only be expected when the problem of the large dipole wave function is treated adequately .",
    "a very useful extension of the above calculation is the coupling of the initial @xmath86 state to higher fock states @xmath87 with gluons or fragmentation of the original @xmath86 state into @xmath88 states which can also be estimated from wilson loops near the light - cone in minkowski space . on the problem of fragmentation the lund model",
    "@xcite has been very successful and it is interesting to see how the above model calculation fares in comparison .",
