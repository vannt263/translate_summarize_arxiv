    "this work proposes a model of management of _ closed seasons _ ( also named _ seasonal closures _ ) for fisheries .",
    "the fao s fisheries glossary defines a closed season of a single marine species as _ the banning of fishing activity _ ( _ in an area or of an entire fishery _ ) _ for a few weeks or months , usually to protect juveniles or spawners_. the closed seasons are implemented by a regulator authority in order to limit the productive factors in certain area during a specific time interval .",
    "a fishery process could envisage alternated periods of closures and _ open seasons _",
    ", where the fishing is allowed .",
    "the closures are introduced according to bioeconomical necessities and its scope considers several spatio - temporal possibilities , leading to concepts as : _ seasonal closures  no area closure _ , _ short term area closure  no seasonal closure _ , _ short term time _ and _ fully  protected area _ , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for details .",
    "this article will consider the special but important case of bioeconomic processes having the following property @xcite : _ low frequency / short duration of open seasons _ combined with _",
    "large magnitude of capture_. in this framework , we propose a feedback regulatory policy which defines the lenght of the next closure as a function of the present captured biomass .",
    "a consequence of this regulation is that under certain fishing effort ( this concept will be explained later ) threshold , the convergence towards a constant length closures ensuring the ecological sustaintability of the resource is obtained .",
    "the literature shows many cases of a long  term time and area closures .",
    "an example is the pacific herring ( _ clupea pacificus _ ) fishery , where the regulatory measures have included very short open seasons as two hours joined with other inputs and outputs restrictions @xcite .",
    "another example is given by a village  base management program in vanuatu , where the stocks should be harvested in a sequence of brief openings interspresed with several years closures ( see @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "cases of annual fisheries combining short periods with large captures , followed by ( comparatively ) low ones at the rest , are registered .",
    "for instance , the fishery of common sardine ( _ strangomera bentincki _ ) and anchovy ( _ engraulis ringens _ ) in the southern chilean coast has a behavior described by the figure 1 .    [ tmouna1 - 0 ]    [ impulsos - capturas ]     [ tmouna1 ]    [ impulsos - capturas ]     the problem of determining the lenght of a closure ( in a context of short ",
    "term open seasons with intense fishing effort ) ensuring the bioeconomical sustantability is a complex issue : indeed , short term closures followed by intense captures could induce an overexploitation of the resource .",
    "on the other hand , long  term closures could have some unexpected drawbacks as : i ) _ bio  sustainable economic rent _ with negative average @xcite .",
    "ii ) promotion of negative _ indirect effects _",
    "@xcite , @xcite when the resource is a top predator .",
    "an example is given by the closure ( 19891992 ) of the mollusk _ concholepas concholepas _ in the chilean coasts @xcite .",
    "iii ) the phenomenon known as _ race for fish _ : fishing units try to outdo one another in fishing power and efficiency during the brief openings @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we will assume that the fishery process has two different time  scales .",
    "in the first scale ( closed seasons ) , the growth of a single unstructured marine resource is described by using ordinary differential equations .",
    "nevertheless , as the capture has a duration considerably shorter than the closures lenght , every open season will be considered as an instant of capture , _",
    "i.e. _ , a term of a sequence @xmath0 , this is the second scale ( see figure 2 ) . in consequence",
    ", the global process will be described by an impulsive differential equation , ide ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "ide equations have been used in the mathematical modeling of processes involving impulsive harvesting : _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see @xcite and @xcite for more applications of ide to bioeconomics and ecological processes respectively ) . in all these references",
    ", the following sequence of harvest instants is employed : @xmath1 which implies that @xmath2 is the time between two consecutive captures .",
    "this paper follows a different approach .",
    "indeed , we introduce a new sequence @xmath0 of harvest instants , where the time for the @xmath3th capture is determined by the amount of the biomass harvested at @xmath4th time ( which will be denoted by @xmath5 ) .",
    "this leads to a length of closed season determined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is some function depending on the amount of the biomass captured at @xmath8 . in consequence , the biomass harvested at time @xmath8 will determine the instant of the next capture",
    "the idea is to define a length closure such that a bigger capture leads to a longest closure and by assuming broad and realistic properties on per capita growth rate and product function , we will find sufficient conditions ensuring a sustainable production , _",
    "i.e. _ , the existence of a globally stable periodic trajectory .",
    "this approach has been introduced in @xcite , where it is pointed out that the resulting model is a new type of ide equations , namely ide with impulses dependent of time ( ide  idt ) and an introductory theory is presented .      in section 2 , we construct a model of fishery with closed seasons and pulse captures , which is described by an ide  idt . in section 3 ,",
    "we study some basic properties of the resulting ide  idt .",
    "the main results concerning the sustainability of the resource are presented in section 4 .",
    "a numerical example is presented in section 5 .",
    "a classical mathematical model of a fishery with closed seasons has to describe the following bioeconomic processes : i ) the growth of the resource ( _ e.g. _ , a single marine species ) .",
    "ii ) the production function .",
    "iii ) the length of the closures .",
    "the growth of the biomass in the close season will be described by the ordinary differential equation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes an increasing sequence of harvest instants .    * growth hypotheses ( g ) *    * * density  dependence .",
    "* the _ per capita rate of growth _",
    "\\to [ 0,+\\infty)$ ] is a derivable and strictly decreasing function of the biomass .",
    "in addition , we assume @xmath12 and @xmath13 . * * bounded variation . *",
    "the rate @xmath11 \\to [ 0,+\\infty)$ ] has lowerly bounded derivative , _",
    "i.e. _ , there exists @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 .",
    "[ commentaire-1 ] the property of derivability stated in * ( g1 ) * is a technical assumption .",

    "hence , the solutions of ( [ natural ] ) are unique to the right and depend continuously on initial condition to the right .",
    "an example of growth rates satisfying * ( g ) * are given by the family : @xmath21^{\\theta}\\big)^{\\beta } , \\quad \\textnormal{with } \\quad \\theta\\geq 1 \\quad \\textnormal{and } \\quad \\beta\\geq 1,\\ ] ] which generalizes the _ logistic verhulst ",

    "( see @xcite ) is the fraction @xmath23 $ ] of average population taken by fishing . in order to estimate it",
    ", we emphasize that there are two possible scenarios : an _ open season _ one , where the fishing is allowed all the time , and a restricted process ( _ closed season _ ) , where the fishing is forbidden .",
    "the global fishing process is studied with two time scales : the first one describes the close season and only considers the growth of biomass summarized by ( [ natural ] ) with assumptions * ( g)*. the second scale concentrates the fishing mortality by considering the captures as pulses defined in a sequence of _ harvest instants _",
    "@xmath10 , obtaining : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the after @xmath4th capture biomass and @xmath26 describes the _ capture function _ in the biomass level at @xmath27 . from ( [ cosecha ] )",
    ", we can see that fishing mortality can be seen as a measure of _ catch per unit of biomass _ ( cpub ) .    for convenience ,",
    "let us define the _ impulse action _",
    "@xmath28\\mapsto [ 0,k]$ ] , as follows : @xmath29    in order to relate fishing mortality with the input factors ( capital and labor ) deployed along the fishing process , the continuous modeling literature has introduced the concept of _ fishing effort _ , which is a rate describing the number of boats , traps , hooks , technicians , fishermens , etc . , per time",
    "( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in an impulsive modeling framework , if the _ punctual fishing effort _ is denoted by @xmath30 , a bounded scalar measure , it is expected to describe ( [ cosecha ] ) by a functional relation @xmath31 , which , combined with ( [ natural ] ) and ( [ action ] ) , allows to introduce the complementary evolution law : @xmath32    we point out that the practical estimation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are complicated matters in bioeconomic theory and we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details .    * harvest hypotheses ( h ) : *    * * impulsive action*. @xmath35 is a derivable and increasing function . * * elasticity*. if @xmath36 , then : @xmath37 for any @xmath38 $ ] .",
