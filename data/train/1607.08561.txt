    "one of the main mysteries of the standard cosmological paradigm is the explanation of the excess of matter over antimatter , which is verified by cosmic microwave background observations @xcite , as well as from big bang nucleosynthesis predictions @xcite .",
    "gravitational baryogenesis is one of the mechanisms that have been proposed for the generation of such baryon - anti - baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , the gravitational baryogenesis has some crucial effects on singular inflation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism for baryon asymmetry incorporates one of sakharov s criteria @xcite , and the baryon - anti - baryon asymmetry is obtained by the presence of a @xmath1-violating interaction term of the form @xmath2 such a term could be acquired from higher - order interactions in the fundamental gravitational theory @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xmath3 is the parameter that denotes the cutoff scale of the underlying effective theory , @xmath4 is the baryonic matter current , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the metric determinant and the ricci scalar . if one applies the above in the case of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry , then the baryon - to - entropy ratio @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 , and especially in the case where the matter fluid corresponds to relativistic matter with equation - of - state parameter @xmath9 then the net baryon asymmetry generated by the term ( [ baryonassterm ] ) is zero .    in the present work we are interested in investigating the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism in the framework of @xmath0 gravity , which is a gravitational modification based on the torsional ( teleparallel ) formulation of gravity .",
    "in particular , in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite the gravitational lagrangian is the torsion scalar @xmath10 , and hence one can construct torsional modified gravity by extending it to @xmath0 @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the interesting point is that although tegr is completely equivalent with general relativity at the equation level , @xmath0 gravity corresponds to different gravitational modification than @xmath11 one , and therefore its cosmological implications bring novel features @xcite .",
    "particularly , we shall examine in detail the effects of various gravitational baryogenesis terms which are proportional to @xmath12 or @xmath13 , in the presence of simple teleparallel gravity as well as in its @xmath0 extensions .",
    "we will examine three viable @xmath0 models @xcite , and we will show that the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio can be compatible to observations , and that this can serve as an additional method to constrain @xmath0 gravity models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ modela ] we briefly review the fundamental properties of @xmath0 gravity . in section [ baryogenesisf ]",
    "we discuss various gravitational baryogenesis scenarios in the context of @xmath0 gravity , and we examine the quantitative implications on the baryon - to - entropy ratio which we calculate in detail for each case under study . finally , the conclusions follow in the end of the manuscript .",
    "in teleparallel gravity the dynamical variables are the tetrads @xmath14 , which form an orthonormal base for the tangent space at each spacetime point .",
    "the metric is then expressed as @xmath15 where greek and latin indices span the coordinate space and tangent space respectively .",
    "moreover , one uses the curvature - less weitzenbck connection @xcite @xmath16 , instead of the standard torsion - less levi - civita one , and hence the gravitational field is described not by the curvature tensor but by the torsion one , which writes as @xmath17 the lagrangian of the theory is the torsion scalar @xmath10 , constructed by contractions of the torsion tensor as @xcite @xmath18 similarly to @xmath11 gravity where one extends the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , namely the ricci scalar @xmath6 , to an arbitrary function @xmath11 , one can generalize @xmath10 to @xmath19 @xcite obtaining @xmath0 gravity as : @xmath20 , \\label{actiontotft}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , with @xmath23 the planck mass .    the field equations for @xmath0 gravity arise by variation of the total action @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the matter action , in terms of the tetrads , namely @xmath26\\ !",

    "additionally , @xmath31 denotes the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to @xmath32 .",
    "note that when @xmath33 one obtains the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity , in which case equations ( [ eomsgeneral ] ) coincide with the field equations of the latter .",
    "let us now apply @xmath0 gravity in a cosmological framework .",
    "we consider a flat frw background geometry with metric @xmath34 with @xmath35 the scale factor , which arises from the diagonal vierbein @xmath36 inserting the vierbein choice ( [ weproudlyuse ] ) into the field equations ( [ eomsgeneral ] ) we obtain the modified friedmann equations @xmath37 with @xmath38 the hubble parameter , and where a `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath39 . in the above equations @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "correspond to the effective energy density and pressure of the matter content of the universe .",
    "finally , note that we have used the relation @xmath42 which according to ( [ tdefscalar ] ) holds for an frw universe .",
    "let us now work in the torsional formulation of gravity , and consider a @xmath1-violating interaction term of the form @xmath43 j^{\\mu}\\ , .\\ ] ] in the analysis to follow we assume that thermal equilibrium exists , thus in all cases which we study we assume that the universe evolves slowly from an equilibrium state to an equilibrium state , with the energy density being related to the temperature @xmath44 of each state as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the number of degrees of freedom of the effectively massless particles @xcite .",
    "hence , for the @xmath1 violating interaction of ( [ baryonasstermtorsion ] ) , the corresponding baryon - to - entropy ratio reads @xmath47 now depending on the specific torsional gravity that controls the evolution , certain differences may occur , which we discuss in the following two subsections .      in simple tegr ,",
    "if the universe is filled with a perfect fluid with constant equation of state parameter @xmath48 , the torsion scalar is given by ( [ th2 ] ) , which using ( [ background1 ] ) becomes @xmath49 interestingly enough , according to ( [ torsionperffluid ] ) it can be seen that the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio is not zero , independently of the equation - of - state parameter of the universe .",
    "this is a radical contrast with general relativity , where in the case of a radiation dominated era the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio is zero @xcite , since the einstein - hilbert equations are of the form @xmath50    let us see what the simple form of equation ( [ torsionperffluid ] ) implies for the baryon - to - entropy ratio .",
    "firstly , by assuming a radiation dominated universe , the energy density is of the form @xmath51 , with @xmath35 the scale factor . consequently , the differential equation ( [ torsionperffluid ] ) can be analytically solved to yield the scale factor @xmath52 where we have assumed that @xmath53 .",
    "we mention that mathematically there is an additional solution to eq .",
    "( [ torsionperffluid ] ) for a radiation dominated universe , but since it is unphysical we omit it . by using ( [ torsionperffluid ] ) , ( [ scalesimpletors ] ) and ( [ equilibrium ] ) , we can obtain the decoupling time @xmath54 as a function of the decoupling temperature @xmath55 , namely @xmath56 note that ( [ decouptimetemp ] ) is an exact relation and not a leading - order approximation , and this situation is unique in the cases we shall consider in this work , since in more complicated @xmath0 theories leading - order approximations are going to be used .",
    "then , by using ( [ baryontoentropyrationori ] ) , the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio @xmath57 reads @xmath58 ^ 3}\\ , .",
    "\\label{sol11}\\ ] ]    we proceed by investigating how the free parameters of the theory affect the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio in this simple teleparallel gravity . as a specific example",
    "we assume that the cutoff scale @xmath3 is equal to @xmath59gev , the decoupling temperature is @xmath60gev , with @xmath61 the upper bound for tensor - mode fluctuations constraints on the inflationary scale @xcite , and moreover that @xmath62 , @xmath63gev and @xmath64 , which is the total number of the effectively massless particles in the universe @xcite .",
    "then , the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio ( [ sol11 ] ) is found to be @xmath65 , which is extremely small , compared to the observed value @xmath66 and more importantly it is negative , which implies that this theory predicts an excess of anti - matter over matter , which is unphysical .",
    "the analysis shows that the baryon - to - entropy ratio is robust against the changes of the initial energy density @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting picture reveals that in order to acquire physically consistent predictions , the simple tegr seems not to produce a viable baryon - to - entropy ratio , and thus a more complicated torsional term is required .      in this subsection",
    "we extend the above discussion in the case of generalized @xmath0 theories .",
    "as we will see , we can use the baryon - to - entropy ratio in order to constrain the functional form of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we start by considering the radiation dominated cosmic evolution with scale factor @xmath68 with @xmath69 being a positive constant .",
    "let us now consider the three viable @xmath0 cases according to observations @xcite .    * the power - law model of bengochea and ferraro @xcite , namely @xmath70 with @xmath71 a constant with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . then from eq .",
    "( [ background1 ] ) we obtain that the energy density at leading order is @xmath74 with the parameter @xmath75 being equal to @xmath76 .",
    "then , the decoupling time @xmath54 as a function of the decoupling temperature @xmath55 is found to be @xmath77 and by using the expression for the torsion scalar ( [ th2 ] ) , the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio ( [ baryontoentropyrationori ] ) becomes @xmath78 thus , by choosing in gev units @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the baryon - to - entropy ratio becomes @xmath81 .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 crucially constrains the baryon - to - entropy ratio , and in order for the upper bound of the ratio to be respected , @xmath82 must approximately satisfy @xmath83 , with the rest of the parameters being chosen as above .",

    "* for the linder model ( [ model2 ] ) , the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio is at leading order @xmath121 which is significantly small due to the presence of the exponential .",

    "this result is unphysical , since the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio is negative .",
    "hence , we deduce that in the case of the generalized baryogenesis term ( [ baryonasstermtorsionnewterms1 ] ) , the exponential model is not suitable for providing the observed excess of matter over anti - matter .",
    "in this work we studied the gravitational baryogenesis scenario in a universe governed by @xmath0 theories of gravity .",
