    "the stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) in a plasma @xcite is a subject of the considerable interest in a several recent decades @xcite .",
    "the motivation of these research efforts is that a substantial power could be reflected from an underdense plasma via sbs thus limiting the absorption of laser radiation in an inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) targets @xcite .",
    "the possibilities of the ion - acoustic plasma wave resonant seeding by a controllable interference patterns of crossed laser beams @xcite were studied in order to manipulate the sbs and raman scattering @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the sbs itself and in combination with a random phase plates ( rpp ) is considered as a possible tool for laser beam smoothing and quenching of spatial instabilities in laser plasma @xcite .",
    "the chaotic intensity and phase variations in a speckle pattern induced by rpp are also in use in wavefront reversal sbs mirrors in order to improve phase - conjugated ( pc ) replica fidelity @xcite .",
    "as is shown recently the dark lines of a speckle ( optical vortices ) which are collocated with the optical phase singularities @xcite inside sbs mirror volume are surrounded by the corkscrew interference patterns @xcite .",
    "these optical helical patterns rotate synchronously with an acoustic angular frequency @xmath0 and their rotation is accompanied by a circular motion of the sbs medium inside pc - mirror @xcite .",
    "such a circular motion of the medium carries an orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite extracted from the exciting radiation @xcite . in a similar way the transfer of oam to an ensemble of @xmath1 ultracold cesium atoms @xcite via rotating interference pattern produced by a pair of the singular laquerre - gaussian(lg ) laser beams had been observed in a nondegenerate four - wave mixing pc geometry .",
    "quite recently the else example of an optical corkscrew patterns had been demonstrated with photorefractive ba : tio@xmath2 pc mirror @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is in analysis of a new mechanism of an ion - acoustic wave ( iaw ) management by means of seeding the corkscrew interference pattern rotating around the isolated optical phase singularity .",
    "the qualitative picture is as follows .",
    "the optical helical pattern rotates due to a frequency detuning @xmath3 between the pump and stockes lg beams ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) which collide inside freely expanding preformed underdense plasma jet ( pj , fig.[fig.2 ] ) created by evaporation of the solid - state target by nanosecond laser pulse .",
    "the parameters are expected to be close to experimental conditions summarized in @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium atomic density @xmath4 is in the range @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the critical density for laser wavelength @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we suppose the detuning is adjusted in resonance with iaw having frequency @xmath8 and fast damping rate @xmath9 @xcite . in this sbs strong damping limit",
    "when duration of laser pulse is about @xmath10 the helical density perturbations of the electron ( @xmath11 ) and ion ( @xmath12 ) liquids of the order of @xmath13 are collocated with the light intensity maxima .",
    "the rotation of the scalar density fields @xmath14 produces a @xmath15 helical plasma flow with angular frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this helical current in the neutral plasma reminiscent to the geometry of a @xmath16 @xcite is expected to produce the axial quasi - static magnetic field .",
    "the mechanism discussed here is different from the process of the photon s spin deposit from the circularly polarized intense light pulse to underdense plasma rotation via inverse faraday effect described in @xcite and already identified experimentally in @xcite by measurement the megagauss ( mg ) @xmath17 magnetic induction @xmath18 . in our case",
    "the @xmath19 @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 @xmath22 lg photons @xcite transfer their oam to an ion - acoustic liquid via three - wave brillouin resonance .",
    "the other difference is in the much lower ( kilogauss range ) magnitude of axial magnetic induction @xmath23 resulting in the absence of the so - called iaw curtailment @xcite .",
    "the resulting helical flow of electron liquid ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) generates both @xmath17 and @xmath24 magnetic inductions @xmath18 and @xmath25 .",
    "we will show that interference pattern ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) rotates as a `` solid body '' and the vector of axial speed @xmath26 ( helix @xmath27 ) is @xmath28 times shorter than the vector of azimuthal rotation speed @xmath29 .",
    "thus the same ratio holds for the current density vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to the corresponding increase of the axial component of magnetic field @xmath23 compared to azimuthal one @xmath25 .",
    "the most interesting issue is the interaction of electron and ion liquids in the process of sbs excitation by a short laser pulse having picosecond duration ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the standard assumption of the plasma quasi - neutrality on the scales larger than debye length ( @xmath33 ) requires the instantaneous compensation of the each electron density perturbation by an appropriate motion of the ion liquid .",
    "thus within a framework of the conventional iaw model the macroscopic electron current must be exactly compensated by ionic current and net current ought to be equal to zero resulting in zero magnetic induction .",
    "this simple assumption is a basement of the three - wave sbs model ( 3 scalar `` parabolic '' pde ) elaborated previously for the subnanosecond plasma flow with @xmath34 temperatures @xcite .",
    "let us look more carefully to this assumption from the point of view of the optical pulse durations in the range mentioned above ( @xmath35 picoseconds ) : both the experiments followed by analytical estimates@xcite and numerical simulations @xcite supposed no magnetic fields .",
    "but the slight change of duration @xmath36 down to the @xmath37 picosecond revealed the substantial magnetic fields @xcite . despite the fact of a five order increase of the optical fluxes ( up to @xmath38 ) the sudden appearence of a mg magnetic field for a @xmath39 flows requires proper interpretation .",
    "the possible interpretation is that a debye screening do not cancel the net current completely due to partial imbalance in between the ion ( @xmath40 ) and electron ( @xmath41 ) liquids . as a result iaw",
    "is transformed into magnetosonic wave @xcite . in order to simplify consideration",
    "we will use the steady - state vortex solutions of sbs iaw with phenomenological parameter @xmath42 which is the ratio of imbalanced electron current compared to ionic current .",
    "the advantage of this simple assumption is in possibility of getting the exact field of velocities and density profile without solving kinetic equation .",
    "noteworthy the other mechanisms of magnetic fields generation .",
    "for example the @xmath17 currents co - directed with picosecond laser pulse were identified experimentally by faraday rotation polarimetry as a source of the toroidal magnetic field of the mg range @xcite .",
    "laser @xmath43 formed by return current of the hot electrons ejected from a thin copper wire by an ultrashort laser pulse was studied in @xcite .",
    "the weibel instability mechanism is responsible for generation of the quasistatic magnetic fields for the anisotropic electron s density in both nonrelativitic helical plasma flows @xcite and intense femtosecond laser pulse in an underdense plasma @xcite .",
    "the singularities in density and magnetic field growing in time as @xmath44 were considered earlier in @xcite .",
    "the gigagauss magnetic induction @xmath45 mechanisms were discussed in @xcite .",
    "sbs is a decay of the quasimonochromatic electromagnetic wave @xmath46 into the stockes wave @xmath47 and the ion - acoustic wave @xmath48 via bragg scattering .",
    "the mechanism of this three - wave parametric instability @xcite is the electrostrictive excitation of a sound wave by the moving interference pattern of two waves ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) detuned by the sound frequency @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is the velocity of the ion - acoustic wave , @xmath51 is refractive index .",
    "the underdense plasma frequency @xmath52 is assumed to be smaller than laser frequency @xmath53 .    in quantum terms the decay of the each pump photon to a stockes photon and",
    "an ion - acoustic phonon follows to energy conservation condition @xmath54 and to momentum conservation @xmath55 as well .",
    "the angular momentum conservation @xcite also takes place resulting in oam deposit in rotating electron liquid ( rather than photon s spin deposit @xcite ) .",
    "in classical picture the detuning between optical waves @xmath0 is a doppler shift arising due to reflection from sound grating moving with the speed @xmath50 in a medium ( plasma ) with refractive index @xmath51 . for the backward sbs",
    "the period of sound grating @xmath56 is approximately equal to a half of exciting wavelength @xmath57 ( bragg reflection condition ) .",
    "noteworthy the bragg and doppler conditions are valid both near the bright spots and in the vicinities of the dark lines as well .",
    "the fundamental difference of the dark ( vortex ) lines from the bright spots of the speckle stems from the different structure of their optical wavefronts . in a bright spot",
    "the wavefront is parabolic while near a vortex line the wavefront is helicoidal @xcite . in spite of the statistical nature of a speckle the complex amplitudes of the electric fields @xmath58 for the counter - propagating waves could be written analytically inside a given bright or dark spot of a speckle . for a homogeneous polarization state",
    "the electric field has the following form in a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath59 nested in a given spot : @xmath60 ,   { \\:}{\\:}{\\:}{\\ : } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is a smooth amplitude function elongated in @xmath62-direction ( e.g. gaussian one ) , @xmath63 is a smooth phase profile ( e.g. parabolic one ) , @xmath64 is an azimuthal quantum number ( topological charge ) .",
    "define the mean square root transverse scale of a speckle entity as @xmath65 .",
    "then mean longitudinal length of a variational speckle functions @xmath61 and @xmath63 is the rayleigh range ( fresnel length ) @xmath66 @xcite . both @xmath61 and @xmath63",
    "are assumed to be parabolic with respect to @xmath67 near @xmath62-axis . for @xmath68",
    "the equation ( [ electric_field ] ) describes the phase - conjugation of a bright spot , e.g. zeroth - order gaussian beam . for @xmath69 and when @xmath70 and @xmath71 the eq.([electric_field ] ) describes the perfect phase - conjugation of an optical vortex with ultimate fidelity i.e. when the correlation integral of the pump @xmath46 and stockes @xmath47 fields is equal to unity @xcite . for the @xmath64-order @xmath72 beam ( lg )",
    "the @xmath61 has gaussian form @xcite .",
    "thus two phase - conjugated lg compose in their common waist the corkscrew interference pattern ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the same corkscrew pattern in pc - mirror appears in the vicinity of the each optical vortex line of an optical speckle pattern : @xmath73{\\ : }   \\times{\\:}r^{{\\:}2{|\\ell| } } { \\ : } { \\ : } f_{p , s}^{{\\:}2}(z , r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the pc - reflectivity .",
    "the maximum of the interference pattern acts as an archimedian screw transferring oam from light to the matter @xcite .",
    "this happens because the orbital part of the electromagnetic angular momentum density @xmath75 of lg is collocated with a maximum of the light intensity @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 corresponds to linear , right and left polarizations of lg respectively .",
    "hence there is a principal difference in between a vortex line and a bright spot in the optical speckle .",
    "the bright spot only pushes the medium by @xmath78 of interference pattern @xcite along propagation direction ( @xmath79 ) of a pump wave @xmath46 , while the vortex line located in a dark spot produces the additional rotational effect upon liquid and imprints the angular momentum therein @xcite .",
    "the easiest way to produce the optical corkscrew by means of the interference of a pair of the two phase - conjugated optical vortices is to use a @xmath80 optical setup ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) reminiscent to optical collider schemes @xcite .",
    "the eq.([electric_field ] ) shows that a phase - conjugated optical vortex @xmath81 has the same ratio of the signs of the @xmath82 and @xmath83 in a self - similar variable as those of a pump wave @xmath84 .",
    "this means that a helical wavefront of the pc - vortex @xmath47 has the same value and sign of the topological charge @xmath64 , as an incident wave @xmath46 .",
    "hence the pc - vortex is absolutely identical to an incident wave except for the exactly opposite direction of propagation .",
    "the restriction on the turnover of the direction of propagation is a number of reflections from conventional , i.e. non - pc mirrors .",
    "the @xmath85 number of reflections changes the topological charge @xmath64 to the opposite one @xcite .",
    "hence the conceptual @xmath80 setup ought to perform the @xmath86 number of reflections in order to keep the topological charges of colliding pulses identical to each other as shown at fig.[fig.2 ] .",
    "the alternative is to use two mode converters ( @xmath87 ) at a final straight path before target @xmath88 ( also at fig.[fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the other restriction imposed on @xmath89 @xmath90 means that a paths of the counter - propagating vortices ought to be equalized with an accuracy better than @xmath91 for proper temporal overlapping .    for the transform - limited light pulses having @xmath92 duration the coherence length is @xmath93 , i.e. above @xmath94 .",
    "in such a case the ultrashort pulses with a singular wavefronts divided by a beamsplitter in a proposed loop scheme ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) will collide in a thin slice of a preformed underdense ( @xmath95 ) plasma jet @xcite and produce corkscrew interference pattern therein . because the sbs sound ( iaw ) grating parameters must be in a resonance defined by doppler and bragg conditions , the frequency shift between colliding pulses should be equal to the ion - acoustic frequency @xmath0 with an accuracy better than ion - acoustic sbs linewidth @xmath96",
    ". such frequency shift could be produced by means of raman scattering in compressed gases .",
    "the acoustical frequency @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath97 for sbs in a room - temperature gases and liquids because it is determined by a thermal velocity @xmath98 at an ambient temperature @xmath99 ( 0.025 @xmath100 ) , where @xmath101 is a boltzmann constant and @xmath102 is a mass of a particle .",
    "the brillouin linewidth in transparent dielectric is defined by a damping rate of sound @xcite .",
    "the ion - acoustic plasma frequency shift @xmath0 has roughly the same dependence on electron and ion temperatures @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in this case",
    "the much higher @xmath105 offers the @xmath106 frequency shift due to a basically same square root dependence @xmath107 , or more precisely @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the ion s charge @xcite .",
    "the sbs linewidth for iaw is due to the landau damping @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "below are the sbs equations of motion for the scalar slowly varying envelope optical fields , i.e. @xmath111 moving in the positive @xmath62-direction and @xmath112 moving oppositely : @xmath113 @xmath114 and dimensionless slowly varying iaw density perturbation complex amplitude @xmath115 @xcite : @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 is the critical plasma density @xcite . for a preformed plasma jet of the thickness @xmath119 @xcite probed by two colliding singular laser beams of comparable amplitudes @xmath120 ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) with beam waist diameter @xmath121 and wavelength",
    "@xmath122 the rayleigh range is @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath124 terms which are responsible for the tranverse effects could be omitted . in the linear regime of sbs and under the weak coupling conditions the fields @xmath125 and @xmath126 are close to those fixed at their free - space values at the opposite boundaries of the jet @xmath88 and their z - dependence",
    "is obtained exactly throughout all inner @xmath62 .",
    "this weak - coupling regime might be justified due to nonsaturated sbs reflectivity ( @xmath127 ) obtained in @xcite .",
    "next assumption is the stationary sbs regime when iaw damping is assumed to be strong : @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "thus exact expression for the complex amplitude of iaw @xmath129)$ ] follows immediately for the pair of colliding @xmath130 vortices @xcite with @xmath131 : @xmath132{\\ : } { \\:}{(r / d)}^{{\\:}2{|\\ell|}}{\\ : } & & \\nonumber \\\\ exp   { \\ : } [ { \\ : } - { \\frac { 2{\\ : } r^2}{d^2(1+z^2/(k_p^2 { \\ : } d^4 ) ) } } ]   { \\frac { \\omega_{ia}}{4 \\nu_l } } { \\frac { { \\epsilon_0 } } { { n_c}{\\:}k_b t_{e}}}|{\\bf e}^{o}_{p}|^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently the density perturbation field @xmath133 demonstrates a rotation typical to optical vortex , alike lg beam .",
    "the difference is in doubled topological charge @xmath134 due to the angular momentum conservation @xcite : @xmath135{\\ : } { \\:}{(r / d)}^{{\\:}2{|\\ell|}}{\\ : } & & \\nonumber \\\\",
    "exp   { \\ : } [ { \\ : } - { \\frac { 2{\\ : } r^2}{d^2(1+z^2/(k_p^2 { \\ : } d^4 ) ) } } ]   { \\frac { \\omega_{ia}}{4 \\nu_l } } { \\frac { { \\epsilon_0}}{{n_c}{\\:}k_b t_{e}}}|{\\bf e}^{o}_{p}|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we see that in the colliding pulse geometry the iaw density perturbation @xmath136 has a form of a double helix which rotates around @xmath79 with the angular frequency @xmath0 ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) . then an analytical expression for the ion - acoustic current density @xmath137 could be extracted from the dynamical equations for the electron liquid @xcite : @xmath138\\ ] ] from the first equation ( [ contin_eq])(continuity equation ) the approximate expression for the ion - acoustic current density vector field @xmath139 may be obtained using following symmetry arguments .",
    "the @xmath140 plays the role of the density of effective `` charge '' density of the long `` charged twisted wire '' , while @xmath141 is an effective `` electric field '' directed along the normal to this `` charged twisted wire '' ( fig.[fig.1 ] , @xmath142 are unit vectors ) .",
    "then the current density is obtained via gauss theorem : @xmath143}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at this point a dimensionless parameter @xmath144 was introduced in order to take into account the partial imbalance of electron and ionic currents .",
    "when @xmath145 there exist two co - rotating iaw vortices generating the equal currents in a plasma jet and this results in a zero net current .",
    "we assume that @xmath146 is substantially smaller than unity .",
    "thus the net current is smaller than steady state ion current by order of magnitude or more and it has a spatial configuration described by ( [ current field ] ) . because the distribution functions @xmath147 @xcite in the proposed geometry ( fig.[fig.1 ] )",
    "are expected to be strongly anisotropic and not known yet the usage of dynamical equations ( [ pumpwave]-[acouswave1],[contin_eq ] ) with phenomenological parameter @xmath146 seems to be reasonable .",
    "then substitution of the @xmath15 @xmath137 in a biot - savarr integral gives the quasistationary magnetic field @xmath148 : @xmath149 } { 4 \\pi |\\vec r - \\vec r|^3 } } { \\:}{\\:}d^{{\\:}3}{\\vec r}\\ ] ] the expression for magnetic induction inside the plasma solenoid ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) and near it s end will be published elsewhere . in the far field",
    "the time - averaged induction @xmath150 has the configuration of the magnetic dipole , whose sign is determined by the optical topological charge @xmath151 : @xmath152 ; { \\ : } { \\ : }   { \\ : } { \\ : }    \\vec \\mu \\approx 2{\\ell } \\vec z{\\ : } { \\frac { { \\ : } i_{ia } { \\:}\\pi d^2 l_{jet } } { \\lambda_p } } , { \\:}\\ ] ] where @xmath153 is an effective magnetic moment induced by the corkscrew ion - acoustic current @xmath154 for the optical fluxes @xmath155 .",
    "the ratio of the axial ( @xmath156 ) to an azimuthal ( @xmath157 ) component of a static magnetic field is given by : @xmath158 this ratio proved to be of kinematic nature and this follows from a @xmath159 @xmath160 rotation of the charged solenoid ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) : the slow axial current producing weak tangential field @xmath157 is due to iaw translational motion while a fast tangential speed @xmath161 produces the large axial induction ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "apart from the isolated double helix interference pattern having diameter near @xmath121 in the proposed loop collider setup ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) , the more complex experimental situation appears in a speckle produced by rpp @xcite .",
    "the optical vortices in a rpp speckle have a size of @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "thus the pump field @xmath164 distorted by rpp may produce a definite pc component in the stockes wave @xmath165 reflected from a plasma jet due to standard sbs - pc mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently it was pointed out that optical speckle consists of randomly spaced set of a vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite .",
    "the analogous vortex - antivortex pairs might occur in an underdense plasma as well because of a similarity of sbs mechanisms in both cases @xcite .",
    "consequently the rotating charges in a plasma are expected to be a sources of the local counter - directed @xmath166 magnetic dipoles .",
    "these dipoles should be collocated with a plasma vortices having doubled topological charge @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "such essentially @xmath168 feature of plasma turbulence may be revealed by numerical investigation in ( @xmath169 ) dimension @xcite with @xmath57 resolution instead of low resolution ( @xmath170 ) numerical experiments in slowly varying envelope approximation @xcite . for the sufficiently large values of the local magnetic induction ( @xmath171 )",
    "the back action of the magnetic field upon plasma currents would be possible .",
    "noteworthy also the related task concerning a collision in a plasma of the two few cycle femtosecond optical vortices with mutually conjugated wavefronts .",
    "in summary we have shown that the nonrelativistic plasma vortex flow resonantly initiated by @xmath172 of the two phase - conjugated optical vortices is capable to produce a kilogauss quasistatic magnetic field in a thin slice of the preformed underdense plasma jet @xcite . in accordance with our model ( eg.[inter_patt1],[density_profile_arb],[current field],[biot - savarr ] ) the particles from a preformed thermal bath having @xmath34 temperatures ( e.g. @xmath173 @xcite )",
    "are accelerated by rotating maxima of light intensity by virtue of ponderomotive force and acquire the azimuthal speed @xmath174 in addition to axial speed @xmath50 which coincides with the iaw velocity .",
    "the azimuthal speed @xmath175 is about two orders of magnitude bigger compared to an axial one @xmath176 ( [ fields_ratio ] ) .",
    "this provides a corresponding increase of the axial component of magnetic induction @xmath177 compared to the azimuthal one @xmath178 .",
    "the axial tesla - range static magnetic fields proposed here in rotating plasma microsolenoid setup might be interesting from the point view of studies of the vacuum birefringence phenomena where a first results had been obtained quite recently in the pvlas experiment @xcite ( noteworthy the different mutual orientation of the laser axis and magnetic induction in our case ) .",
    "the case of relativistic intensities and femtosecond laser duration @xmath179 in a geometry ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) was not studied yet and this case deserve a particular consideration .",
    "nevertheless it is worth to mention the else interesting feature of the rotating interference pattern described by ( [ inter_patt1 ] ) . for the sufficiently large radius @xmath180 the speed of the azimuthal motion @xmath181 of the optical interference pattern may reach or even exceed the speed of light in a vacuum @xmath182 .",
    "it well known that such a superluminal motion of the interference maxima does not violate casuality because formula ( [ inter_patt1 ] ) presumes the overlapping of infinitely long pulses .",
    "as is shown previously for the `` fast light '' phenomena @xcite the interference maxima can not transfer the superluminal signal thus casuality is maintained .",
    "the same situation holds for the nonlinear laser amplifiers @xcite and optical pulses in dispersive medium @xcite . in our case",
    "when azimuthal speed of rotation @xmath181 approaches @xmath183 , the actual relativistic plasma flow will be different from the above formulated nonrelativistic sbs model which presumes the collocation of the optical intensity maxima and plasma current ."
