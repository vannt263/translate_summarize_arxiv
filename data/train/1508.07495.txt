    "properties such as superconductivity , magnetic ordering , nearly ferromagnetic fermi - liquid and heavy fermion behavior have been observed in many materials , including the family of complex intermetallic compounds @xmath15zn@xmath1 ( @xmath16 = rare earth , @xmath2 = transition metal).@xcite this family , first reported two decades ago by nasch @xmath17.@xcite , has been extensively used as a model system due to its rather unique structure which features a complex but well ordered crystal structure .",

[",
    "fig : fig0 ] .",
    "two particular properties observed in these materials have attracted great attention : a remarkably high magnetic ordering temperature observed in the @xmath16fe@xmath3zn@xmath1 series ( although it contains less than @xmath23 of @xmath16 ion ) and a nearly ferromagnetic fermi - liquid behavior in yfe@xmath3zn@xmath1.@xcite    several works have argued , based on macroscopic measurements and band structure calculations , that the elevated magnetic ordering temperatures and the type of magnetic ordering are attributed to a high density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level.@xcite for instance , the co based compounds gdco@xmath3zn@xmath1 and tbco@xmath3zn@xmath1 present an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering below @xmath24 5.7  k and 2.5  k , respectively , in which the larger @xmath16-@xmath16 distance ( @xmath24 6  ) supports an indirect interaction and a low transition temperature .",
    "when the co ions are replaced by fe ions ( gdfe@xmath3zn@xmath1 and tbfe@xmath3zn@xmath1 ) the compounds exhibit ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering with the transition temperatures drastically raised to 86  k and 66  k , respectively .",
    "the relatively long distance between rare earth ions in the structure weakens the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchange interaction , while the high density of fe 3@xmath14 bands at the fermi level directly affects the conduction electrons .",
    "recently , a detailed study of the magnetic structure of tbco@xmath3zn@xmath1 and tbfe@xmath3zn@xmath1 through magnetic neutron scattering at low temperature was reported.@xcite although the tb - based compounds present similar magnetic properties as compared to gdco@xmath3zn@xmath1 and gdfe@xmath3zn@xmath1 , the absence of crystalline electric field ( cef ) at first order and a strong rkky interaction in the gd - compounds affect the electronic and magnetic interactions between the rare earth ions and the surrounding matrix .",
    "in particular , the investigation of the compounds with half - filled 4@xmath25 shell ( gd - based materials ) at low temperature can provide information about the physical properties and are very important as reference compounds due to their lack of orbital momentum , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which leads to magnetic properties that are unaffected by spin - orbit coupling . in order to understand the implications of such interactions we have used spectroscopy and magnetic scattering techniques to probe in detail the electronic and magnetic properties of the gd@xmath0zn@xmath1 family .",
    "the large gd neutron absorption cross section leaves x - ray measurements as the ideal option to probe of the magnetic and electronic properties in these materials .",
    "furthermore , the incoming beam energy can be tuned to the absorption edge , thus providing chemical and atomic selectivity , i.e. , the magnetic response of each element can be probed separately .    here",
    "we report the magnetic and electronic structure at low temperature of the gd@xmath0zn@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = fe , co ) compounds using x - ray resonant magnetic scattering ( xrms ) , x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) techniques .",

    "surprisingly , a magnetic signal of about 0.06  @xmath8 is detected at the zn @xmath12-edge which suggests that the zn ions are spin polarized .",
    "this magnetic signal might originate from the hybridization between the extended gd 5@xmath14 bands with the empty zn 4@xmath32 states .",

    "are weakly affected and hence it is not possible to induce magnetic moment in the transition metal ions .",
    "the absence of magnetism in the transition metal ions are also observed in the tbco@xmath3zn@xmath1 compound , in which the best refinement of the magnetic structure was obtained with null magnetic moment in the co and zn ions .",
    "although gdco@xmath3zn@xmath1 and tbco@xmath3zn@xmath1 compounds display the same magnetic propagation vector @xmath5 , their magnetic structures are different , which is mainly related to the competition between the rkky and cef interactions . for the tb - based materials the crystalline electric field splitting can affect the @xmath112 constant and therefore influence the magnetic coupling and the temperature transition .",
    "it is well known that an energy level cef splitting induces magnetic anisotropies in the ground state and it may influence the total angular momentum .",
    "several tb - based intermetallics have exhibited distinct magnetic properties in relation to the gd counterparts as shown in the layered family @xmath113 ( @xmath16 = rare earth ; @xmath2 and @xmath114 = transition metal ; @xmath115 = 1,2 and @xmath116 = 0,1 ) .",
    "@xcite although gdco@xmath3zn@xmath1 and tbco@xmath3zn@xmath1 compounds display the same magnetic propagation vector @xmath5 , their magnetic structures are different , which is mainly related to the competition between the rkky and cef interactions .",
    "the modification in the magnetic structure for different rare earth ions but with the same propagation vector has already been extensively investigated and it is mainly related to the rkky and cef interactions .",
    "et al_. [ ] evaluated the cef parameters from the thermodynamic measurements for the entirely @xmath16co@xmath3zn@xmath1 series ( @xmath16 = tb - tm ) and they observe small energy scales ( small @xmath117 parameter ) and a large @xmath118 cef parameter for the complete series .",
    "this finding suggests a small energy level splitting and a strong influence of the zn cage on the rare earth ions , i.e. , guest - framework interaction .",
    "therefore , we can suggest that the rare earth ions located in this large polarized environment are strongly affected by the zn cages , which has direct influence in the electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "this can be seen in the different magnetic structures for the afm compounds and the spin polarization of the zn ions only for the gdfe@xmath3zn@xmath1 compound .",
    "hence , the cef effect has an important role in this class of compound . a detailed investigation for different rare earth elements would allow a better understanding of the @xmath16co@xmath3zn@xmath1 family .",
    "nevertheless macroscopic measurements up to 1.8 k only report magnetic ordering for the compounds with @xmath16 = gd and tb .",
    "we have investigated the intermetallic gd@xmath0zn@xmath1 system with @xmath119 co and fe at low temperature using the xrms and xanes / xmcd techniques , respectively .",
    "the xrms measurements performed in gdco@xmath3zn@xmath1 compound reveal a commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic propagation vector @xmath5 in which only the gd ions carry magnetic moments .",
    "selected magnetic reflections were measured in the polarization channel @xmath48 and we identified that the gd spins follow the magnetic representation @xmath7 , which is different from the isostructural compound tbco@xmath3zn@xmath1 , mainly due to the cef effects in the latter .",
    "the evolution of magnetic signal showed a magnetic phase transition below t@xmath120 = 5.72(6 )  k with a critical exponent @xmath58 = 0.36(3 ) , suggesting a three - dimensional ( 3d ) heisenberg magnetic model .",
    "the xanes and xmcd measurements performed at the gd @xmath33 edges in gdfe@xmath3zn@xmath1 compound reveal a strong magnetic signal ( @xmath24 12.5  @xmath8 - @xmath10 and 9.7  @xmath8 - @xmath11 ) indicating a splitting of the 5@xmath14 orbitals and a strong gd - gd exchange interaction as well as a non zero orbital moment .",
    "in addition , we observed a presence of a small magnetic dichroic signal at the zn @xmath12 edge due to the spin polarization of the gd 5@xmath14 orbitals .",
    "this indicates a large rkky exchange interaction between the gd - gd ions which polarizes the surrounding matrix .",
