    "the _ metamaterial _ concept usually refers to a periodic arrangement of artificially structured elements , designed to achieve advantageous and/or unusual electromagnetic properties compared to those of naturally occuring materials @xcite .",
    "for example , the first metamaterial ever realized @xcite , exhibited negative refraction index in a narrow frequency band around 5 gigahertz .",
    "the negative refraction index property requires that both the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are simultaneously negative .",
    "the most widely used elements for constructing a negative refractive index metamaterial are the electrically small resonant particles called _ split - ring resonators _ ( srrs ) and metallic wires .",
    "while the array of wires gives a negative permittivity below the plasma frequency , the array of the srrs gives a negative magnetic permeability above their resonance frequency .",
    "thus , the refraction index can be negative in a narrow frequency band .",
    "since their discovery , metamaterials have been the target of intensive study .",
    "although the developement of metamaterials at microwave frequencies has progressed to the point where scientists and engineers are now pursuing applications , research on metamaterials that operate at higher frequencies is still in an early stage @xcite .",
    "there is a wide subclass of metamaterials , that exhibit significant magnetic properties and even negative magnetic permeability at terahertz and optical frequencies @xcite , even though they are made of non - magnetic materials .",
    "magnetism at such high frequencies is particularly important for the implementation of devices such as tunable lenses , adaptive mirrors , etc .",
    ", since there are only a few natural materials that respond magnetically above microwaves .",
    "moreover , magnetism in those natural materials is usually weak and within narrow frequency bands , limiting thus their use in possible terahertz devices .",
    "the most common realization of such a _ magnetic metamaterial _ is composed of periodically arranged srrs in a one- or two - dimentional lattices . in its simplest version",
    "an srr is just a highly conducting @xcite or superconducting @xcite ring with a slit .",
    "the srr structure was originally proposed by pendry @xcite , who theoretically predicted that a periodic srr - based structure could exhibit a negative magnetic permeability frequency band when irradiated by an alternating electromagnetic field of appropriate polarization .",
    "pendry also realized that the srr structure has considerable potential for enchancing nonlinear phenomena .",
    "when the srr dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident field , the srr can be regarded as an electric circuit consisting of inductive , capacitive and ohmic elements connected in series .",
    "the ring forms the inductance @xmath0 , while the slit can be considered as a capacitor of capacitance @xmath1 .",
    "the ohmic element @xmath2 may represent all possible losses of the structure .",
    "the next step was naturally to built nonlinearity in the srr structure .",
    "nonlinearity implies real - time tunability and multistability that is certainly a desired property of possible future devices .",
    "the srrs can become nonlinear either by the insertion of a strongly nonlinear dielectric @xcite or a nonlinear electronic component ( i.e. , a varactor ) @xcite into their slits .",
    "both ways would lead to effectively field dependent magnetic permeability for an array of nonlinear srrs .",
    "recently , the dynamic tunability by an external field for a two - dimensional array of varactor - loaded srrs was demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the srrs in such an array are coupled through magnetic and/or electric dipole - dipole interactions , whose strength depends on the relative orientation of the srrs and their slits in the array @xcite .    in the equivalent circuit picture ,",
    "the dynamics of a periodic nonlinear srr array irradiated by an electromagnetic field , can be described by a set of coupled and driven ordinary differential equations with on - site nonlinearity .",
    "the discreteness , which is inherent in those srr - based magnetic metamaterials , along with the nonlinearity and the weak coupling between their elements , allow for the generation of nonlinear excitations in the form of intrinsic localized modes or _ discrete breathers _",
    "these nonlinear modes appear generically in discrete and nonlinear extended systems .",
    "recent theoretical work in one- and two - dimensional nonlinear srr lattices have demonstrated the existence and the stability of discrete breathers both in energy - conserving and dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "it has also demonstrated that breathers may be formed spontaneously through modulational instability in binary nonlinear magnetic metamaterials @xcite . moreover , domain - wall excitations @xcite and envelope solitons @xcite may as well be excited in those systems , which seem to be stable even in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "the srr - based magnetic metamaterials support a new kind of electromagnetic waves , the magnetoinductive waves , which exhibit phonon - like dispersion curves , and they can transfer energy along the array @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible to fabricate a contact - free data and power transfer device , a _ magnetoinductive transmission line _ , which make use of the unique properties of the magnetic metamaterial structure , and may function as a frequency - selective communication channel for devices via their magneto - inductive wave modes @xcite . in the present work",
    "we investigate the power transmission along a one - dimensional varactor - loaded srr - based magnetic metamaterial , in the two possible geometries , which is driven at one end by a sinusoidal power sourse . in the linear limit",
    ", energy tranfer along the array occurs only for driving frequencies in the linear magnetoinductive wave band .",
    "however , the nonlinearity could generate more frequency bands where efficient power transmission along the array is possible .",
    "power transmission in chains of coupled anharmonic oscillators for driving frequencies in the band gap of the linear spectrum has been recently investigated , and that effect is referred to as self - induced transparency @xcite or supratransmission @xcite . for frequencies inside the linear magnetoinductive wave band",
    "the power is transmitted along the array from the magnetoinductive wave modes , slightly modified by the presence of nonlinearity . however , for frequencies in the pass - bands resulting from nonlinearity , the power is transmitted along the array from nonlinear , breather - like excitations . in the next section",
    "we derive the model equations for a varactor - loaded srr - based magnetic metamaterial , where the nonlinearity has the form a polynomial expansion on the main variable , like that investigated in @xcite .",
    "we also present bifurcation diagrams for the shortest possible end - driven array , i.e. , an array with only two varactor - loaded srrs , from which only one is directly driven . in section iii",
    "we obtain analytical solutions for the linear magnetoinductive waves of the end - driven , finite srr array when losses are neglected , along with their discrete dispersion relation . in section",
    "iv we present numerical results for power transmission and discuss their dependence on the model parameters for a short , end - driven varactor - loaded srr array with and without an absorbing boundary at the non - driven end .",
    "we finish with concluding remarks in section v.",
    "consider a ring - shaped or a squared split - ring resonator with a hyperabrupt tuning varactor mounted onto its slit .",
    "the varactor type could be selected from a large variety of available varactors , according to the needs of the experiment . in recent experimental works on varactor - loaded srr - based metamaterials @xcite ,",
    "the varactor selected was a skyworks smv1231 - 079 , whose voltage - dependent capacitance @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the voltage across the diode ) is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dc rest capacitance , @xmath7 is the intrinsic potential , and @xmath8 is a parameter .",
    "the values of those parameters are provided by the manufacturer spice model for that varactor to be @xmath9 from eq .",

    "we have also used a totally absorbing boundary by adding five more sites at the right end of the array , where the damping coefficient increases exponentially with increasing site number .",
    "thus , the waves coming from the left are completely damped at the end of the extended array , and no reflection occurs .",
    "the total number of srrs is now @xmath196 where @xmath197 , and the dissipation coefficient @xmath58 is now a function of the site number @xmath56 , @xmath198 , given by @xmath199 where @xmath200 , with @xmath88 as before .",
    "for the array with @xmath46dependent dissipation coefficient , a typical average power density plot is shown in fig .",
    "11 , where the power in each site is the average over a time interval of @xmath201 .",
    "we observe , at least for the first @xmath49 sites of the array , a pattern similar with those seen in figs . 7 and 8 .",
    "that is , the appearance of the linear and the nonlinear transmission bands at about the same frequency intervals .",
    "we also observe that almost all of the transmitted power is absorbed from the five last sites of the array .",
    "importantly , the narrow band coming from geometrical resonances in figs . 7 and 8 , which is around @xmath202 , appears in fig . 11 as well , and moreover it seems that it is capable of transmitting power to the end of the array .",
    "( in dbm ) on the @xmath203 plane for a varactor - loaded srr array with absorbing right boundary ( see text ) , for @xmath162 , @xmath204 , @xmath88 , and @xmath205 ( @xmath151 ) . , title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "we have used a simple electric circuit model of inductively coupled resistive - inductive - capacitive circuits with voltage - dependent capacitance to investigate the transmission of power in a one - dimensional , end - driven , nonlinear magnetic metamaterial comprised of varactor - loaded srrs .",
    "we have used both a reflecting and an absorbing boundary for the end that is not driven by the external field .",
    "the importance of such discrete models for describing the dynamic behaviour of srr - based magnetic metamaterials has been recently appreciated @xcite , although similar discrete models have been employed earlier for the study of localized excitations in those systems @xcite    in the present work , we have focused on the transmission of power along the array , and especially that in the nonlinear regime , which results in the formation of nonlinear pass - bands for frequencies close to the resonances of a single varactor - loaded srr that is described by the approximate model equation ( [ 10b ] ) .",
    "the approximate model holds fairly well for relatively low driving amplitudes , for which the dissipative diode current of the varactor can be neglected .",
    "it seems , thus that the properties of the individual elements of the array predominantly determine its transmission properties , at least in the case of weak magnetoinductive coupling investigated in the present work .",
    "the numerical results demonstrate that the nonlinear pass - bands transmit power with efficiently comparable to that of the linear band . for the parameter sets used in this work , which are close to those in @xcite for a single varactor - loaded srr , there are three nonlinear bands , both above and below the linear band .",
    "their width apparently depends on the frequency , i.e. , the bands at higher frequencies are significanlty wider than those at lower frequencies .",
    "moreover , we have also observed the formation , either complete or partial , of another nonlinear pass - band at frequencies slightly above the linear band ( at @xmath185 ) .",
    "that band , which is rather narrow and can be observed both in figs . 7 and 8 as well as in fig .",
    "11 , seem to depend sensitively on the model parameters @xmath57 , @xmath174 , @xmath206 ( for @xmath101 and @xmath102 fixed ) , and mainly on the loss coefficient @xmath58 .",
    "comparing figs . 7 and 8 , which have been obtained for different loss coefficient @xmath88 and @xmath180 , respectively , we see that the power transmission in that band considerably decreases when the losses increase by an order of magnitude .",
    "that type of nonlinear band appears due to geometrical resonances of the standing waves that are formed in the array due to driving at one end .",
    "geometrical resonances seem to offer an important mechanism for the generation of nonlinear pass - bands , which can be employed for constructing transmission lines with banded power transmission spectra with bands at desired frequency ranges .",
    "similar conduct - free transmission lines could be formed by superconducting magnetic metamaterials , where the basic structural element ( the srr ) is replaced by its direct superconducting analogue , the rf squid @xcite .",
    "the rf squid , where the acronym stands for radio - frequency superconductive quantum interference device , is just a superconducting ring interrupted by a josephson junction , which makes it an intrinsically nonlinear element . a one - dimensional array of rf squids coupled through their mutual inductances forms a nonlinear magnetoinductive transmission line @xcite whose power transmission properties is a matter of future work .",
