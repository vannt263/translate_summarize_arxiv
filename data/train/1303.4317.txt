    "a wide variety of observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) power spectra over the last decade have indicated that cosmic structures originated from seed fluctuations in the very early universe . the leading theory explaining the origin of the cosmological seed perturbations is cosmic inflation @xcite , a period of accelerated expansion at very early times .",
    "during the inflationary stage , microscopic quantum fluctuations were stretched to macroscopic scales to provide both the initial seeds for the primordial density perturbations and tensor ( gravitational - wave ) fluctuations @xcite . despite the simplicity of the inflationary paradigm , the exact mechanism by which cosmological perturbations are generated is not yet established .    in the standard slow - roll inflationary scenario associated with the dynamics of a single scalar field ( the inflaton ) , density perturbations are due to fluctuations of the inflaton itself as it slowly rolls down along its potential . in the simplest case , fluctuations are of the adiabatic type , namely they are sourced by the degree of freedom that is dominating the energy density during inflation ( the inflaton ) . in other mechanisms for the generation of perturbations , _",
    "e.g. , _ the curvaton mechanism @xcite , the final adiabatic perturbations are produced from an initial isocurvature mode associated with quantum fluctuations of a light scalar degree of freedom ( other than the inflaton ) , whose energy density is negligible during inflation .",
    "the isocurvature perturbations are then transformed into adiabatic perturbations when the the extra scalar degree of freedom ( the curvaton ) decays into radiation after the end of inflation .",
    "a precise measurement of the spectral index , @xmath0 , of the scalar perturbations together with a detection of gravity - wave signals in cmb anisotropies through its @xmath1-mode polarization will provide a strong hint in favor of single - field models of inflation .",
    "indeed , alternative mechanisms predict an amplitude of gravity waves far too small to be detectable by experiments aimed at observing the @xmath1-mode of the cmb polarization .    while inflation is the leading candidate model for the generation of primordial perturbations , in the words of ref .",
    "@xcite : `` inflation is at the same time a spectacular phenomenological success , and an enduring theoretical challenge . ''",
    "the phenomenological success is that inflation is a simple model for the generation of seed perturbations .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to understand how inflation is embedded in a broader theory or model of fundamental physics",
    ". detailed examination of the cmb perturbations are a possible way to discriminate among inflation models @xcite , perhaps even leading to a reconstruction of the inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "another application of cmb data is to search for evidence of `` new '' physics , like additional relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination @xcite , neutrino masses @xcite , early dark energy @xcite , modified gravity @xcite , or variation of fundamental constants like the fine - structure constant @xcite or the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to examine whether existing cosmological datasets can provide evidence for the dynamics of the inflaton field during inflation or evidence for new `` neutrino '' physics .",
    "evidence for the dynamics of the inflaton field during inflation would be a departure from the harrison ",
    "zeldovich ( hz ) model ( a scalar spectral index of unity and no tensor perturbations ) .",
    "the departure from the hz model could take the form of a scalar spectral index different than unity , a `` running '' ( a scale - dependence ) of the scalar spectral index , or evidence for tensor modes .    the type of new `` neutrino '' physics we model would be a mass for neutrinos or additional relativistic degrees of freedom contributing to the expansion rate around the time of recombination .",
    ", of course the new relativistic species need not be neutrinos . ]",
    "our analysis will include cmb data from the nine - year data release of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap9 ) @xcite , the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite , and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite , including measurements up to a maximum multipole number of @xmath2 .",
    "we will also include information from measurements of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from galaxy surveys in the form of three datasets : data release 7 ( sdss - dr7 ) @xcite and data release 9 ( sdss - dr9 ) @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey , and the wigglez project @xcite .",
    "we will also use data on the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "this study has two motivations .",
    "on one hand , the planck collaboration @xcite will release soon their first flow of data regarding the cmb anisotropies , and therefore it is timely to have a state - of - the - art pre - planck assessment of slow - roll inflation . on the other hand ,",
    "we wish to answer three basic questions :    1 .",
    "is the simple harrison - zeldovich model compatible with current cosmological datasets , or is there support for a more complicated perturbation spectrum ?",
    "2 .   is standard neutrino physics consistent with current cosmological datasets , or is there support for new neutrino physics in the form of a neutrino mass in excess of a few tenths of an electron volt or a change in the effective number of light neutrinos ?",
    "3 .   in the event",
    "that there is support for physics beyond the hz spectrum and standard neutrinos , can one tell whether the data provides information about the primordial perturbation spectrum or the neutrino sector ?    as we will see , all combinations of current datasets point to physics beyond the minimal hz model with standard neutrino physics .",
    "in particular , allowing for either a scalar spectral index different from unity or an additional number of relativistic degrees of freedom , produces a significant increase in the goodness of fit with respect to the minimal hz model .",
    "information beyond that depends on the dataset used .    for a dataset with act ( and not spt ) , there is no significant increase in the goodness of fit by increasing the complexity of the perturbation spectra by allowing for running of the scalar perturbations and/or a tensor component .",
    "concerning neutrino physics , there is no significant further increase in the goodness of fit by allowing for a nonzero neutrino mass . for the dataset with act",
    ", we can only say that a model with a scalar spectral index different than unity is a much better fit than the hz model , and a model with a non - standard number of neutrinos is also a much better fit . in the sections below",
    "we will quantify these statements .",
    "the situation is much different if we examine a dataset with spt ( and not act ) .",
    "and hz@xmath3 are concerned .",
    "we find however that the answer to the question of whether cosmological data points to physics beyond an hz @xmath4 model strongly depends on the choice of whether the dataset includes act or spt .",
    "] there are a significant increases in goodness of fit allowing either a running of the scalar spectral index ( and not much increase in goodness of fit just by allowing a tensor component ) on top of the hz+@xmath5 model , or a nonzero neutrino mass to the hz model .",
    "again , in the sections below we will quantify these statements .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a cosmological dataset including spt suggests either a more complex perturbation spectrum than simply a scalar spectral index different than unity , or some other new physics such as a modification of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom . the data do not prefer one approach over the other .    the papers is organized as follows : in the next section we review the pertinent features of slow - roll inflation .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , we will work under the hypothesis that the adiabatic perturbations originated within the single - field , slow - roll framework of inflation .",
    "it should be kept in mind that if future experiments do not detect isocurvature modes or large non - gaussianity it will not be possible to distinguish directly the inflaton contribution from the , _ e.g. , _ curvaton contribution , see ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a detection of a significant amount of tensor modes through cmb anisotropies will disfavor curvaton - like models as they tend to generate a negligible tensor contribution .    within the single - field slow - roll paradigm , many specific models for inflation have been proposed .",

    "perturbations created during inflation are of two types : scalar ( or curvature ) perturbations , which couple to the stress - energy of matter in the universe and form the `` seeds '' for structure formation , and tensor , or gravitational - wave perturbations , which do not couple to matter .",
    "both scalar and tensor perturbations contribute to cmb anisotropies .",
    "scalar fluctuations can also be interpreted as fluctuations in the density of the matter in the universe .",
    "scalar fluctuations can be quantitatively characterized by the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath39 . as long as slow roll",

    "the running of the spectral index is negligible , so a detection of scale dependence in the spectral index would rule out a large class of viable single - field inflation models , and would therefore be a powerful probe of inflationary physics .",
    "in what follows we we examine the possibility of new neutrino physics as an alternative to extending the complexity of primordial perturbations .",

    "as mentioned previously , any new species that is relativistic around recombination will contribute to @xmath57 , whether it is a neutrino species or not .",
    "the exact contribution of a new relativistic species will depend on the number of spin degrees of freedom , whether the new species is a boson or fermion , and the temperature of decoupling of the new species .",

    "we make an exception to this rule in those cases where the posterior probability is not vanishingly small at the edge of the prior range ; this happens in particular around @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in this case",
    "we adopt the following rule : if the maximum of the posterior distribution is clearly distinguished from zero , we quote the 68% interval as above ; otherwise , we quote a 95% upper limit .",
    "we also use our markov chains to recover the maximum likelihood ( _ i.e. _ , minimum @xmath81 ) parameter values .",
    "we use the minimum @xmath81 values estimated from the chains to perform an approximate model comparison by computing the likelihood ratio ( actually , equivalently , the difference in @xmath81 ) between models . as a rule of thumb , given two models @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the latter reduces to the former for a particular choice of parameter values (",
    "in which case the two models are said to be `` nested '' ) , we say that the data show preference for @xmath84 over @xmath85 when the absolute value of @xmath86 is larger than the number of additional parameters in the extended model .",
    "we note however that mcmc methods are usually optimized to sample the full posterior distribution around the region of maximum probablity , and not to recover the exact value and position of the maximum likelihood . the precision to be associated with our estimate of the minimum @xmath81 can be evaluated by computing the probability of finding in the chains a sample having a @xmath81 within @xmath87 from the actual minimum ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this probability depends on the dimensionality of the parameter space and on the number of independent samples in the chains .",
    "we let our chains run until we can claim a 95% probability of having found the best - fit model with an uncertainty @xmath88 .",
    "as a first step in our analysis we evaluate the compatibility of current cosmological datasets espt and eact with a simple reference model , which we choose to be the harrison - zeldovich ( hz ) model with @xmath89 , @xmath79 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath62 .",

    "thus , cosmological data point to some interesting new physics .",
    "unfortunately , the direction is unclear .",
    "probably the most dramatic explanation would be additional light degrees of freedom : it would be very surprising if there is a new light species beyond the standard model of particle physics ( as we have emphasized , it need not be extra neutrino species , although we parameterize them as such ) .    for the eact dataset , just adding a tilt to the scalar spectrum seems to be all that is demanded of the data .",

    "<S> data from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the south pole telescope ( spt ) , combined with the nine - year data release from the wmap satellite , provide very precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) angular anisotropies down to very small angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> augmented with measurements from baryonic acoustic oscillations surveys and determinations of the hubble constant , we investigate whether there are indications for new physics beyond a harrison - zeldovich model for primordial perturbations and the standard number of relativistic degrees of freedom at primordial recombination . </S>",
    "<S> all combinations of datasets point to physics beyond the minimal harrison - zeldovich model in the form of either a scalar spectral index different from unity or additional relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination ( _ e.g. _ , additional light neutrinos ) . beyond that , the extended datasets including either act or spt provide very different indications : while the extended - act ( eact ) dataset is perfectly consistent with the predictions of standard slow - roll inflation , the extended - spt ( espt ) dataset prefers a non - power - law scalar spectral index with a very large variation with scale of the spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> both eact and espt favor additional light degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> eact is consistent with zero neutrino masses , while espt favors nonzero neutrino masses at more than 95% confidence . </S>"
