    "a classic , powerful approach to optimal control problems consists in solving a verification partial differential equation in the hamilton jacobi form obtained using the bellman s dynamic programming principle .",
    "one remarkable advantage of this approach , compared to the optimality conditions study , is the ability to provide global minima and closed - loop optimal controls ; on the other hand , the study and the approximation of the value function of the problem which is an unavoidable technical step , is often difficult .",
    "an exceptional achievement was made with the introduction of viscosity solutions , a weak notion of solution proposed by crandall , evans and lions in the 80s , and the successive refinements ( for a whole presentation of this subject referring to the monographs @xcite ) .",
    "a special benefit of this approach is to move the attention from the study of the trajectories of the problem to some geometric properties of the value function , opening in this way a wide range of techniques that , in the following , have shown a good efficiency .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a problem related to this .",
    "it consists in the detection of a collection of subsets , contained in the domain of the problem , where the value function restricted to each sub - domain is independent on the value of any other subset .",
    "this knowledge is useful for several reasons : it is related to stabilization problems , reachability sets reconstruction , or , as we will show later in this paper , in parallel procedures for a fast numerical resolution .",
    "this point is of special interest .",
    "in fact it is well known as the greatest limitation to the use of the bellman approach in optimal control is due to the complexity of solving the hamilton jacobi equation associated ; especially in high dimensional context .",
    "the `` curse of dimensionality '' , a meaningful definition proposed by the same r. bellman , has been attacked in the last twenty years from several directions and various tools have been developed .",
    "some examples of acceleration techniques are fast marching @xcite and fast sweeping methods @xcite .",
    "the strategy of these methods is to focus on the implicit order driven by the characteristics of the problem to compute each node only once , reaching convergence to the discrete solution in finite time . despite the high efficiency of these techniques , born in the context of the resolution of the eikonal case ( where the organisation of the nodes is more evident ) , a generalization to more general equations is not trivial and still under investigation .",
    "some proposals can be found ( fast matching methods ) in @xcite and ( generalized fast sweeping methods ) @xcite .",
    "another possible strategy is to decompose the domain in a collection of subsets , chosen in a number which is sufficient to lower the quantity of nodes to process in every sub - problem .",
    "meanwhile to solve in parallel on every sub - domain .",
    "the difficulty in this idea is about conditions to impose on the interface between two different subsets , or equivalently if some regions of overlapping are introduced , about the manner to handle the computation .",
    "moreover , a technique of that kind requires an iterative process performed on every subdomain , with a consequent growth of the total complexity . for a whole dissertation on the subject of domain decomposition techniques ( dd )",
    "we refer to the monograph @xcite , for hamilton jacobi equations @xcite and about a parallel version of the fast sweeping methods @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach was proposed in @xcite where the authors , passing to a quasi variational inequality formulation which is shown to be equivalent of the original problem , can handle a decomposition of the domain .",
    "a new direction of research was opened by ancona and bressan in @xcite where they introduced the original concept of _ patchy feedback _ with the intention of studying an asymptotic stability problem .",
    "navasca and krener in @xcite used these ideas to develop a technique of reconstruction for the feedback solution in some special polynomial cases ( _ patchy solutions _ ) .",
    "again , these elements inspired the work of cacace et al .",
    "@xcite . they propose , in a special class of hamilton - jacobi equations , a preliminary procedure called _",
    "patchy decomposition_. this preliminary computation supplies a partition of the domain in sets which could be computed separately without any exchange of information between the interfaces",
    ". the result is archived using the multi - grid idea of pre - computing the problem on a coarse grid , solving the synthesis problem to have an optimal feedback control , and using it to detect a decomposition of the domain , accordingly with an approximation of the characteristics of the problem .",
    "they show in practice that the error added in this procedure is sufficiently small in some cases of interest .",
    "our paper can be considered a development of this idea . by using some recent results in decomposition techniques we will state in a rigorous way the concept of _ independent sub - domain _ ( different concept from _ patchy subset _ ) and we will show an easy property which permit us an implicit way to reconstruct them without the delicate step about the feedback control ( we recall that , in general , there is no guarantee of convergence of an approximated optimal feedback to the continuous control )",
    ". we will be able to prove the convergence of the technique and provide some error estimates .",
    "with this background we will enlarge significantly , with respect to the tests performed in @xcite , the class of equations where the decomposition is appropriate . indeed , through the paper there will be discussed the analogies and the differences with the _ patchy decomposition_.    the paper is organized as it follows : in section 2 we will introduce , functionally to our purposes , the minimum property which is useful for the decomposition and the concept of _ independent sub - domains_. in section 3 we propose an algorithm for their location .",
    "main result of this part is the necessary condition contained in proposition [ p:1 ] which characterizes the points of the grid belonging to a certain independent domain . finally in section 4 there",
    "will be discussed the application of the previous results to propose a parallel algorithm for the approximation of the solution .",
    "the main benefit of our proposal will be claimed in proposition [ conv ] where the convergence of the technique and a bound for the error will be proved . through some test examples",
    "we will show the good features of the proposal .",
    "in this section there are presented some basic definitions and features which are necessary for the comprehension of the paper .",
    "in particular the decomposition property presented in details in @xcite will be shortly recalled .",
    "let us first of all introduce the classical framework of an _",

    "a key property of the value function that we will use in the following is the possibility to solve a collection of hamilton - jacobi equations obtaining the original solution as the point - wise minimum of such family .",

    "this is not shown in a table because it would be simply constant through the various choices of @xmath220 .",
    "the experimental evidence shows us an error even smaller than the normal resolution , or at least equal .",
    "this is due to the fact that in presence of a `` favourable '' decomposition of the problem , where non differentiability points of the solution lie on a regular point of every decomposed solution , the value in that point is reconstructed as a minimum of a collection of smooth functions .",

    "it is possible to see an innate limitation of the efficacy of such decomposition for parallel computing : the exact division in independent subset is not balanced , then the reduction of dimension in the greater subset will be less considerable . in some cases",
    "this problem could even nullify the efficacy of the method ( we can obtain a decomposition in some empty sets and the whole @xmath15 ) , we will discuss this point in the conclusions section .    as already remarked this decomposition guarantees a rate of convergence to the solution equal to the resolution on the whole domain .",
