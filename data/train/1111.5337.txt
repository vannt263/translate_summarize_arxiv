    "the study of quantum systems with low spatial dimensions represents an active field of study that is being pursued aggressively in the context of emergent phenomena and has important implications for both fundamental and applied physics . for instance , the reduced dimensionality of the system is relevant to the properties of thin films and surfaces  @xcite , and for the understanding of high - temperature cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "this in turn poses classroom challenges , aiming at exposing students to the array of formal techniques required to study such systems , with a special emphasize on linear response theory aimed at studying the response of the quantum system to a perturbation  @xcite .    in quantum many - body systems",
    "the role played by correlations and quantum fluctuations is greatly affected by the reduced dimensionality of the system .",
    "understanding the role played by collective excitations in calculating the response to a perturbation of a many - body system represents a fundamental problem in many - body theory  @xcite .",
    "the special case of a homogeneous gas of interacting spin-@xmath0 fermions has important applications ranging from condensed matter and ultracold atom gases to nuclear and high - energy physics .",
    "furthermore , the response of an interacting system can be represented as the response of a noninteracting system of particles to an effective self - consistent field .",
    "this is true in particular for weakly - interacting systems of particles .",
    "therefore , a classic problem in many - body theory is the calculation of the response function for a system of noninteracting spin-@xmath0 fermions ( e.g. electrons ) .",
    "the intent of this paper is pedagogical .",
    "the response function of a fermi gas in three , two and one dimensions can be obtained in closed form , and this derivation represents a useful classroom exercise . in addition , the fermi gas results are intended as the baseline for studying the dielectric response function in a @xmath1-dimensional penn - model semiconductor  @xcite , perhaps the simplest semi - realistic demonstration of changes introduced by the presence of a gap in the single - particle energy dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "the latter will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "consider the interaction of an electrostatic field , @xmath2 , with a system of fermions .",
    "then , the external potential will induce a charge distribution , @xmath3 , which in turn produces a potential @xmath4 .",
    "the total electrostatic potential @xmath5 is given by the sum of the external potential and that associated with the induced charge distribution , i.e. @xmath6 similarly , the total electric charge , @xmath7 , is given by the superposition of the charge distribution of the noninteracting target , @xmath8 , and the induced charge distribution , i.e. @xmath9 the individual external , induced and total charge distributions and electrostatic potentials obey poisson equations of the form @xmath10 in a linear - response approximation , we have @xmath11 where the electron response function is calculated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , as @xmath12 or , in momentum space , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are single - particle energies and wave functions , and @xmath16 are occupation functions of the single - particle states .",
    "we have also introduced the notation , @xmath17 , and the matrix elements are calculated as @xmath18 for uniform systems , we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential in _",
    "dimensions , i.e. @xmath21 with the euler constant , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the dielectric function in rpa reads @xmath23",
    "a system of noninteracting spin-@xmath0 fermions is commonly referred to as a fermi gas ( fg ) system . in this system ,",
    "one - particle states are plane waves characterized by momentum @xmath24 , spin @xmath25 , corresponding to the usual spin - up ( @xmath26 ) and spin - down ( @xmath27 ) fermions , and one - particle energies , @xmath28 .",
    "all states below momentum fermi , @xmath29 , are occupied .",
    "hence , the occupation of the one - particle states is given by @xmath30 in the following the sum over states @xmath31 is understood as an integral over all one - particle states , i.e @xmath32 the fermi gas density in @xmath1  dimensions is calculated as follows @xmath33 as a matter of convenience we express momenta in terms of the fermi momentum , @xmath29 , and energies in terms of the fermi energy , @xmath34 .    assuming fermi - gas - like occupation functions , @xmath35 , the response function reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the heaviside function and @xmath38 depends on the ground - state model .",
    "the factor 2 is the degeneracy factor corresponding to a system of spin-@xmath0 fermions .",
    "the matrix elements   corresponding to the case of a fermi gas system are given by @xmath39 therefore , we find that @xmath40 and the response ( lindhard ) function for the case of the fermi gas is local .",
