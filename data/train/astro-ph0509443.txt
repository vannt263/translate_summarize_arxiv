    "recent experiments dedicated to the study of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background have found evidence for galactic microwave emission in the range 1090 ghz correlated at high galactic latitudes with thermal emission ( dirbe 100 @xmath0 m map ) from interstellar dust ( kogut et al .  1996 ; leitch et al .  1997 ; de oliveira - costa et al .  1999 , 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "an explanation for this anomalous dust - correlated microwave emission based on electric dipole emission from fast rotating carbon - based molecules has been proposed by draine & lazarian 1998a , b ) .",
    "these models appear to reproduce the major features of the so - called anomalous microwave emission ( finkbeiner et al .",
    "2004 ) but do not identify the actual carrier of the emission .    iglesias - groth ( 2004 ) has recently shown that photoabsorption by fullerenes and buckyonions ( multishell fullerenes ) in the interstellar medium ( ism ) can account for the uv bump ( 217.5 nm ) of the interstellar extinction curve and possibly for some of the diffuse interstellar bands .",
    "it is suggested that fullerenes and buckyonions are broadly distributed in the galaxy and contain a large fraction of interstellar carbon .",
    "the intrinsic dipole moment of these highly symmetric molecules is rather small , thus it is unlikely that they contribute significantly to the anomalous microwave emission .",
    "however , it is expected that a fraction of fullerenes in the interstellar medium will be hydrogenated ; the so - called fulleranes would have a much higher dipole moment because of the polar nature of the c - h bond .",
    "experimental results on the electric dipole moment of isolated alkali - c@xmath1 molecules show an increase from 12.4 d ( debye ) for c@xmath1li to 21.5 d for c@xmath1cs and indicate a strong electron transfer from the alkali atom to the c@xmath1 cage that is almost complete for the largest alkalis ( antoine et al .",
    "given this behavior it is reasonable to expect that the dipole moment of fulleranes is higher than tha of the c - h bond ( 0.3 d ) and therefore , these molecules are potential carriers of electric dipole emission .",
    "fulleranes have deserved attention as potential carriers of diffuse intestellar bands and other interstellar and circumstellar features ( webster 1991 , 1992,1993a , b ) .",
    "both , fullerenes and fulleranes have also been detected in samples of the allende meteorite ( becker & bunch 1997 ) which suggests their existence in the interstellar medium . in this paper",
    ", we study the electric dipole emission of fulleranes with various level of hydrogenation in representative physical conditions in the interstellar medium and show their potential as carriers of the anomalous microwave emission in the galaxy . the predicted emissivities are compared with very recent measurements of anomalous microwave emission in the perseus molecular complex ( watson et al .",
    "we will consider here the various families of fulleranes c@xmath2 h@xmath3 that can be formed from icosahedral fullerenes with @xmath4 = 60 , 180 , 240 , 540 , 960 , 1500 , and 2160 carbon atoms .",
    "fullerenes can also adopt multilayered configurations in which one is encapsulated inside another with separation of @xmath5 3.43.5  .",
    "these multishell fullerenes , also called buckyonions , can also be hydrogenated .",
    "we will consider here only those buckyonions with a complete number of shells and with hydrogen atoms bonded only in the outermost shell . at most , one hydrogen atom may be bound to each of the carbon atoms of a fullerene ; thus , the number , @xmath6 , of hydrogen atoms of any fullerane or buckyonion will lie in the range @xmath7 to @xmath4 .",
    "the ratio between the number of hydrogen and carbon atoms will be , @xmath8 .",
    "we will deal with the following types of chemical species : c@xmath9h@xmath10 , c@xmath11h@xmath10 , c@xmath12h@xmath10 , c@xmath9h@xmath13 , and the corresponding hydrogenated buckyonion analogs ( c@xmath14c@xmath15c@xmath16h@xmath17 , etc . ) .",
    "fullerene radii , @xmath18 , were adopted as in iglesias - groth et al .",
    "they range between 3.55    and 21.5    for c@xmath1 and c@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the hydrogen atoms of the fulleranes are expected to be located radially outward from the carbon atoms .",
    "the length of the c  h bond will be taken as in benzene 1.07    ( see , for example , braga et al .",
    "we assume the moment of inertia , @xmath20 , of a fullerene as that of a spherical cage with radius @xmath21r : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mass of the carbon atom .",
    "for the ensemble of fulleranes with @xmath6 hydrogen atoms we adopt as moment of inertia the sum of the moment of inertia of the relevant fullerenes , i@xmath24 , with the moment of inertia of an hypothetical spherical cage of mass @xmath6 times the mass of the hydrogen atom , and radius @xmath25  .",
    "the moment of inertia of the hydrogenated buckyonion will be taken as the sum of the moments of inertia of all the individual fullerenes conforming the molecule plus that of the layer of hydrogen atoms .",
    "we will assume in what follows that the dipole moment of a fullerane ( or hydrogenated buckyonion ) is proportional to the dipole moment of the c  h bond ( @xmath260.3 d ) and that the hydrogen atoms are randomly distributed on the surface of the cage in such a way that the intrinsic dipole moment of the fullerane with @xmath6 hydrogen atoms can be approximated by @xmath27 .",
    "we will adopt a value @xmath28 in the calculations .",
    "owing to collisions with ions and electrons and also because of photoelectric emission , fullerenes in interstellar space may be charged .",
    "an additional electric dipole component could be expected as a consequence of any displacement between the centroid of the molecule charge and the center of mass ( purcell 1979 ) .",
    "given the high symmetry of our molecules we will assume these displacements produce negligible additional dipole moments and will thus adopt the same value for the dipole moments of c@xmath29h@xmath17 , c@xmath30h@xmath17 and c@xmath2h@xmath17 .",
    "fulleranes of the form c@xmath2 h@xmath31 , where a proton has been adsorbed instead of a neutral hydrogen atom , will significantly increase their intrinsic dipole moment .",
    "given the absence of experimental information , we have estimated what would be the permanent dipole moment for this type of molecule and also for protonated buckyonions , using the formalism in rittner ( 1951 ) .",
    "this takes into account the relatively high polarization contribution of the fullerene cage .",
    "values for the polarizabilities of the fullerenes and buckyonions have been adopted from the semiempirical model of iglesias - groth et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , this formalism gives 5.9 d for the dipole moment of c@xmath1h@xmath13 .",
    "since this formalism may overestimate the dipole moment of these molecules we will conservatively assume in these cases that the value of the dipole moment is that of the c ",
    "h@xmath32 bond ( 1.68 d , follmeg et al .",
    "to study the rotational damping and excitation mechanisms affecting fulleranes and hydrogenated buckyonions in the ism we will use the formalism developed by draine & lazarian ( 1998a , b ) .",
    "we will consider two representative environments in the interstellar medium : a ) the so - called cold neutral medium ( cnm ) characterized by low hydrogen density of @xmath33= 30 @xmath34 , gas temperature of @xmath35 k , and low ionization fraction @xmath36(h@xmath32)@xmath37n@xmath38 ; and b ) the warm ionized medium ( wim ) with very low density @xmath33 = 0.1 @xmath34 , gas temperature of @xmath39 k , and high ionization fraction @xmath36(h@xmath32)/@xmath33 = 0.99 .",
    "in thermal equilibrium , fulleranes share the same temperature as the gas and estimation of the rms rotation frequency is straightforward .",
    "when the temperature of fulleranes and gas are different , some processes will produce rotational damping and others will lead to rotational excitation .",
    "draine and lazarian discuss both types of processes comprehensively .",
    "following their treatment , we compute the rotational damping produced by _",
    "collisional drag _ , associated with h , h@xmath40 , and he species ( neutral and ions ) temporarily stuck and subsequently desorbed from the surface of the fullerenes ; _ plasma drag _ caused by the the interaction of the electric dipole moment , @xmath0 , of the fullerene and the electric dipole of the passing ions ; and the _ infrared emission _ , due to the thermal emission of photons that previously heated the molecule .",
    "we also compute rotation excitation rates associated with the impact of neutral particles and ions , plasma drag , and infrared emission .",
    "we have assumed the temperature of the fulleranes is 20 k in the cnm and wim phases of the ism . in figure 1",
    "we show results for the effective rotation rates , @xmath41 of fulleranes with different degree of hydrogenation .",
    "we illustrate the case for the cnm phase of the ism .",
    "the rotation rate decreases as the radius of the molecule increases .",
    "buckyonions show slower rotation rates due to the higher moment of inertia .",
    "increasing the level of hydrogenation for molecules of a given radius ( increasing the dipole moment ) leads to lower rotation rates .",
    "we display results for three levels of hydrogenation @xmath42 , 1/10 , and 1/3 , where @xmath4 is the number of carbon atoms in the fullerane or in the most external shell of the buckyonion .",
    "assuming @xmath28 , in the case of c@xmath1 these hydrogenation ratios correspond to dipole moments of 0.3 , 0.74 , and 1.34 d , respectively ; and 0.3 , 4.4 , and 8.1 d for c@xmath19 , the largest fullerane in this study .",
    "hydrogenation ratios as high as @xmath43 are not rare among other carbon based molecules , for example pahs , and as discussed by webster ( 1992 ) may be rather common in fulleranes . for comparison , we also display the rotation rates of singly protonated fullerenes in wim conditions .",
    "we find lower rotation rates than in the cnm case .",
    "emissivity curves for individual fulleranes and buckyonions of various sizes are plotted in figure 2a for cnm conditions . for these computations , we assume that the densities of c@xmath1h@xmath3 and c@xmath44h@xmath3 are 0.2 @xmath45 10@xmath46 @xmath33 , as obtained for similar size fullerenes in iglesias - groth ( 2004 ) . for the larger fulleranes abundances are scaled down according to the size distribution law @xmath47 , with @xmath48 = 3.5 @xmath49 1.0 proposed in the previous paper .",
    "we are assuming @xmath28 and illustrate results for the case @xmath43 .",
    "we find that for a given level of hydrogenation the major emitters are the smallest fulleranes , and that the frequency of peak emission decreases as the radius increases .",
    "we also plot the total emissivity curve for a mixture of monoshell fulleranes following the proposed size distribution law .",
    "the computations have been extended up to fulleranes with n=2160 , but clearly the largest fulleranes have negligible contribution to the total emissivity curve .",
    "remarkably , this curve shows significant emission ( above 10% of the peak ) in the range 10 to 65 ghz with a peak near 25 ghz . for comparison",
    ", we also plot emissivity curves for a mixture of hydrogenated ( same @xmath50 value ) icosahedral buckyonions with a complete number of shells , starting with c@xmath14c@xmath51h@xmath3 .",
    "we assume the same abundance for this molecule as for the single c@xmath51h@xmath3 .",
    "the emissivity of these buckyonions is similar to that of the indilvidual fullerane of same radius .",
    "we also plot the emissivity curve that would correspond to a mixture of hydrogenated buckyonions following the previous size distribution . in this case , most of the emission lies in the frequency range 1030 ghz with a peak at @xmath518 ghz . for the same level of hydrogenation ,",
    "the buckyonion mixture has a much lower emissivity than the mixture of single - shell fulleranes .    in panel",
    "b of figure 2 we show how the predictions are sensitive to the level of hydrogenation and to the physical conditions of the medium .",
    "we present total emissivity curves for a mixture of fulleranes and hydrogenated buckyonions ( following the size distribution of index , @xmath52 ) with three different levels of hydrogenation ( @xmath42 , 1/10 , and 1/3 ) for both cnm and wim conditions . increasing the level of hydrogenation ( i.e. , increasing the average dipole moment of the molecules ) leads to a narrower frequency range for the emission .",
    "the abundances of the smaller fullerenes ( c@xmath1 and c@xmath44 ) have been assumed the same @xmath53 @xmath33 .",
    "wim emissivity curves are found narrower and shifted to lower frequencies . under wim conditions it would be plausible to expect some degree of protonization of the fulleranes . as an indication of how significant this could be regarding electric dipole emission , we show in the figure the emissivity curve obtained for the case @xmath42 , but considering a proton instead of a hydrogen atom . in this case , the much larger dipole moment of the molecules makes the peak emission to shift down almost a factor 2 . in summary ,",
    "under cnm conditions we expect the hydrogenated fullerene / buckyonion mixture produces electric dipole emission with a peak in the range 2050 ghz which shifts to lower frequencies as increases the hydrogenation level . in wim conditions",
    ", this emission tends to be narrower and shifted to lower frequency .",
    "very recently , using data from the cosmosomas experiment ( 1117 ghz ) in combination with wmap data , watson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that on scales of a few degrees , the anomalous microwave emission detected towards the perseus molecular complex dominates any other known galactic emission process ( synchotron , free  free , or dust emission ) in the frequency range 1050 ghz .",
    "the anomalous emission peaks at 22 ghz ( with an integrated flux of @xmath540 jy ) very close to the peak emission that we have found for a mixture of fullerenes under cnm conditions .",
    "watson et al .",
    "show how a mixture of cnm and wim of draine and lazarian models of electric dipole emission by spinning dust particles may explain the results .",
    "the nature of the particles in the draine and lazarian models are very general , so it is interesting to study whether the anomalous microwave emission can be explained by fulleranes with a minimum number of hypotheses .    in figure 3",
    "we plot the empirical results obtained by watson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and emissivity curves for mixtures of fulleranes and buckyonions computed as described above .",
    "the measurements are corrected following the prescriptions in watson et al .  for the contribution of vibrational dust ( @xmath54 k and emissivity index 1.55 ) and for the contribution of free - free in the perseus region .",
    "we consider all the measurements available in the frequency range where anomalous emission appears to make a major contribution , i.e.  from 10 to 90 ghz and overplot emissivity curves computed for several minimal cases either using cnm conditions or a combination of cnm and wim .",
    "we plot a few examples that show how the predicted emissivities are indeed very close to those observed .",
    "fitting the observations require some fine tuning between the number of molecules under cnm and wim conditions and the level of hydrogenation . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that in wim conditions the fullerenes are singly protonated .",
    "first , it is apparent that a significant level of hydrogenation is required if fulleranes are to explain the observed emission . increasing the level of hydrogenation leads to a higher dipole moment and",
    "shifts the bulk of emission to lower frequencies .",
    "however , the tail emission at high frequencies ( @xmath55 40 ghz ) also requires a contribution of fulleranes with a small dipole moment .",
    "molecules under wim conditions alone would not be able to explain this tail .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve in figure 3 corresponds to the emissivity of a mixture of fulleranes and buckyonions in cnm , where any possible degree of hydrogenation has equal weight .",
    "the curve has been scaled to match approximately the measurement at 22 ghz , but the shape is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "the dotted line present the results for a mixture assuming a range of hydrogenation peaking at @xmath56 , such that 40% of the molecules of a given radius have @xmath56 , 30% have a factor 2 higher dipole moment and the remaining 30% a factor 2 lower .",
    "the emissivity curves obtained for other hydrogenation ranges do not give significantly better fits .",
    "the experimental data are best reproduced ( solid line ) for a combination ( with equal weight ) of the previous curve and the emissivity curve of singly protonated fullerenes in wim conditions , again scaled to match the measurement at 22 ghz .",
    "this factor is close to 3 and results from a possible underestimation of the dipole moments and/or number density of fulleranes in the region .",
    "the dashed line illustrates the same combination between cnm and wim but modifying the hydrogenation range of the molecules in cnm , which are now assumed to be uniformly distributed among @xmath56 , 1/20 , and 1/30 .    in summary , it is possible to understand the perseus microwave anomalous emission in terms of electric dipole emission of fulleranes if they follow a size distribution similar to that proposed in the study of the uv extinction bump .",
    "the dominant microwave emission would be associated to the smaller fullerenes .",
    "lazarian and draine ( 2000 ) have suggested that fast rotating ultrasmall ( @xmath57 10  ) grains may be aligned with the interstellar magnetic field via paramagnetic resonance relaxation and produce polarized electic dipole emission .",
    "recent reports that carbon based material like graphite ( esquinazzi et al .",
    "2002 ) polymerized fullerenes ( makarova et al . 2001 ) and c@xmath1h@xmath58 hydrofullerites ( antonov et al .",
    "2002 ) exhibit a weak ferromagnetic moment suggests that the magnetic properties of fulleranes could also lead to polarized rotational electric dipole emission .",
    "precise measurements of the intensity and polarization of the anomalous microwave emission and its relation with uv extinction in the perseus molecular complex and other similar regions will be essential to establish the role of these molecules .",
    "we have computed effective rotation rates of hydrogenated fullerenes in the ism and find values in the 165 ghz range with a clear trend toward lower rotation as the radius of the molecule increases . increasing the level of hydrogenation shifts the peak of electric dipole emission to lower frequencies .",
    "we predict emissivity curves for fullerane mixtures assuming the abundance and size distribution @xmath59 proposed for fullerenes in the ism .",
    "we find that the dominant dipole electric emission would be due to fulleranes with radii smaller than @xmath5 1015    and dipole moments of order @xmath5 1 d. changes in the degree of hydrogenation moves the peak of the emissivity curves in the range 1060 ghz .",
    "the resulting curves for mixtures of fulleranes in cnm and wim conditions reproduce the recent observations of anomalous microwave emission in the perseus molecular complex .",
    "the bulk of this emission can be explained in terms of electric dipole radiation of small icosahedral fullerenes ( c@xmath1 to c@xmath51 ) with a modest hydrogenation level .",
    "laboratory measurements of the dipole moment of fulleranes are crucial to the further study of these molecules as potential carriers of the dust - correlated microwave emission detected by cosmic microwave background experiments .",
