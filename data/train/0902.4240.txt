    "based on the same quasar sample and a slightly brighter galaxy sample ( selected with @xmath97 ) @xcite used a density - based estimator and showed that the dominant magnification signal of the quasar - galaxy correlation follows the expected dependence as a function of quasar magnitude .",

    "this is expected to occur at @xmath99 .",
    "the presence of galaxies in the star sample may give rise to a similar correlation between source reddening and galaxy overdensity , since galaxy clustering gives rise to an excess of redder galaxies in overdense regions , which produces a similar signal that mimics the reddening by dust .",
    "we have measured the reddening - clustering correlation of sdss galaxies with @xmath100 and found that a contamination of galaxies at about 10% could explain the reddening signal seen around stars . ] finally , we have investigated the dependence of the signal as a function of galactic reddening : by splitting the dataset into two regimes of galactic extinction given by the @xcite map , we did not detect any significant change in our signal .",
