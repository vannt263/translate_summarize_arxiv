    "during the last decade , it has been increasingly realized that adherent cells actively explore and respond to the geometry and stiffness of their adhesive environment , with dramatic consequences for fundamental cellular processes such as survival , proliferation , differentiation and migration  @xcite .",
    "using chemical inhibitors for both myosin motors and actin filaments , it has been shown that active contractility of the actin cytoskeleton is an indispensable requirement for the observed cellular response to the physical properties of the environment .",
    "although more and more details are revealed regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying these sensing processes  @xcite , what is still missing is a systems - level understanding of how cells integrate the way force is generated , distributed , and sensed over the whole cell .",
    "therefore theoretical models are required which describe how force is propagated through the actin cytoskeleton as a function of environmental geometry and stiffness . because the actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the sensing capabilities of cells ,",
    "one expects that its mechanical properties have evolved to support these important cellular functions .",
    "although it is a standard procedure in experiments to block force generation and propagation with chemical inhibitors or by rna interference , it is very difficult to measure how force is distributed inside cells and between cells and their environment .",
    "different experimental approaches have been developed to meet this challenge .",
    "traction force microscopy allows to measure the forces transmitted to the substrate  @xcite .",
    "recently this technique has been extended in such a way that also cell - cell forces can be estimated from cell - matrix forces @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that many forces balance inside the cell and are not transmitted to the substrate , so the forces existing inside cells might be much higher than appreciated from traction force microscopy  @xcite .",
    "laser cutting allows to estimate forces from the mechanical relaxation after cutting load - carrying elements like microtubules in the mitotic spindle  @xcite or stress fibers in the actin cytoskeleton  @xcite .",
    "laser ablation can be used for subcellular analysis of cortical tension  @xcite .",
    "however , these experiments only probe local relaxation events of prominent cytoskeletal structures and therefore might miss the global effects of more distributed and less visible structures .",
    "micromanipulation can be used to distort the mechanical balance of the cell globally  @xcite , but the resulting changes in force distribution can only be estimated indirectly from its effects , e.g. growth of focal adhesions . to achieve a more systematic understanding , these experimental approaches have to be complemented by theoretical approaches .    because the mechanical properties of cells , extracellular matrix and tissue are strongly determined by filamentous networks of proteins like actin , tubulin , lamin ,",
    "spectrin or collagen , mechanical networks are widely used theoretical models for cell and tissue mechanics  @xcite .",
    "one of the best studied cases is the red blood cell , whose shape and mechanics has been studied with network approaches in very large detail  @xcite .",
    "modern computer power permits to simulate each of the roughly @xmath0 spectrin links separately and with molecular detail , for example using the appropriately parametrized force - extension curve of a semiflexible polymer  @xcite . in the limit of small extensions",
    ", these models usually reduce to hookean networks .    for adherent cells ,",
    "the main structural determinant is the actin cytoskeleton , whose mechanics differs in several important aspects from the one of the spectrin network of red blood cells . in general ,",
    "the molecular structure of the actin network is much less defined .",
    "its most prominent feature in adhesion is strong contractility due to activity of myosin ii motors .",
    "this observation implies that the mechanical links between the nodes of the network can not be simple actin filaments , but have to be bundles of actin filaments crosslinked and tensed by myosin ii motors .",
    "the simplest model for prestress in a mechanical network is the introduction of a finite resting length which is smaller than the typical extension of each link .",
    "indeed , one- and two - dimensional spring networks with prestress are widely used for modeling cell migration  @xcite .",
    "network models are conceptually very appealing due to their multi - scale nature : by changing the microscopic rules for the mechanics of the links , one can explore how the macroscopic behavior of the whole network changes . in particular , important biological effects like viscoelasticity of the links or coupling to diffusion fields can be incorporated  @xcite .",
    "spring networks offer the additional advantage that homogenization techniques can be used to arrive at continuum models .",
    "recently , the interplay between force generation and the geometrical and adhesive properties of the environment have been addressed using the powerful framework of finite element models ( fem ) @xcite , which can be considered as the continuum limit of appropriate network models .",
    "most fem - models use constitutive equations which correspond to hookean networks .",
    "although conceptually very appealing , modeling cell mechanics with hookean networks does not reflect the fact that the actin cytoskeleton does not provide much resistance to compression . this is especially true for two - dimensional networks for cell adhesion and migration , because in this case the network might contract laterally , while the cytosol flows into the third dimension . in this situation",
    ", the network links do not behave as springs , but rather as cables , which are characterized by an asymmetric force - extension relation .",
    "there are several microscopic reasons for this effective behavior : not only do thin actin bundles easily buckle under load , they also tend to telescope in due to filament sliding and even to depolymerize once tensile stress is relieved .",
    "cable networks have been successfully used to model the prestress - dependent mechanical response of adherent cells to local mechanical perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the same model has also been used to describe how mechanical stress is propagated from the nuclear region through the cytoskeleton towards focal adhesions , where changes in load lead to changes in adhesion size  @xcite .",
    "one striking feature of strongly adhering cells is the fact that retracted contours often take the shape of circular arcs @xcite .",
    "although for cable networks the resulting shapes are strongly invaginated , it has been shown that the circular invaginations observed for cells pinned at discrete sites of adhesions can only be explained if an additional contractile force is introduced for each mechanical link  @xcite . this additional force in an actively contracting cable network does not vanish at the resting length and represents the fact that contractility arises mainly from myosin ii motors , which in steady state operate close to a non - vanishing stall force .    in this paper , we systematically compare the different network models introduced before for adherent cells ( spring models , cable networks , and actively contracting networks ) in regard to the predicted shapes and force distributions . our main conclusion is that actively contracting cable networks share many crucial features with adherent cells . due to their linear nature , actively contracting spring networks are equivalent to passive spring networks with a reduced resting length . passive networks ( both from springs and cables ) have a well - defined reference state even in the absence of adhesion constraints and in general give similar results regarding shape and force distribution , which is determined mainly by global inputs like the spatial distribution of the adhesion points .",
    "in contrast , actively contracting cable networks do not have a well - defined reference state because without adhesion constraints , they contract onto a point .",
    "in this case , we find that shape and force distributions are determined mainly by the local distribution of adhesion sites .",
    "the internal force distribution is constant in the bulk and strongly localizes to the contour , where forces jump by orders of magnitude .",
    "this motivates a detailed study of two contour models , which allow us to derive analytical predictions which we then compare with the results from the computer simulations .",
    "we also discuss how actively contracting cable networks can be extended to model non - linear or adaptive linker mechanics , and comment on the relation of our network models to tissue mechanics .",
    ". if the network links are strained , restoring forces @xmath1 appear .",

    "makes them fully three - dimensional , see sketches in a , b .",
    "however , here we focus on lateral contraction and contour effects and thus the nucleus is expected to play a minor role . in the following",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to two dimensions and model the cytoskeletal network as a two - dimensional mesh of mechanical links joined at @xmath8 discrete nodes .",
    "nodes are labeled with indices , e.g.  @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "microscopically links and nodes may represent filament bundles and local accumulation of cross - linkers , respectively , but in a more general sense , these mechanical elements are simple representatives of an unknown network architecture which we model in a statistical sense .",
    "the network is subject to internal forces originating from molecular motor activity , @xmath11 , and the mechanical resistance of filaments to strain , @xmath12 , compare c.    we introduce three fundamentally different kinds of mechanical models for the network links .",
    "the simplest case is a hookean spring network ( hsn ) composed of links with resting length @xmath6 , which represent linear springs with spring constant @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the young s modulus of the link and @xmath15 its cross - section .",
    "the restoring force acting on a node @xmath9 due to elastic strain in the link @xmath3 then reads : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimensionless unit vector along the link @xmath3 . here ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 specify the node positions , @xmath20 is the length of the link and @xmath21 is the strain in the link .",
    "the linear force - extension curve of a single link in a hsn is shown in d as a dashed line with short dashes .",
    "the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton are attributed mainly to the actin part .",
    "actin is a semi - flexible filament prone to buckling under compression and thus behaves like a cable , which can be stretched but not compressed .",
    "the hookean assumption of a symmetric elastic response is therefore not valid .",
    "the mechanical properties of actin networks on a coarse - grained scale are more accurately described by assuming a finite resistance of filaments to tension , but no resistance to compression .",
    "the mechanical restoring forces originating from a link connecting two nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the passive cable network ( pcn ) are therefore given by : @xmath22 we show the asymmetric force - extension relation of the pcn links in d as a dashed line with long dashes .",
    "let us assume that molecular motors are homogeneously distributed in the network .",
    "because they are arranged in a parallel fashion , their individual forces add up .",
    "we therefore assume that a link contracts with a force @xmath23 proportional to its initial length , where @xmath5 is force density per length . for computational simplicity ,",
    "here we assume that this force does not change as the filament contracts , although in practise , it might well be that the line density rather than the total number of active motors is constant . for a link @xmath3",
    "we therefore have : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the tensile force per initial length applied by the motors .",
    "the finite force at zero length is unphysical and we avoid it by introducing an additional rule such that force is diminished if two neighboring nodes come closer to each other than some small distance @xmath26 : @xmath27    combining pcn and active contraction , we obtain what we call the active cable network ( acn ) , compare the solid line in d : @xmath28 neither the detailed choice of @xmath7 nor the assumption of a linear force reduction below @xmath7 are crucial for our results .    active contraction can also be combined with the hsn",
    ". however , this simply shifts the straight dashed line in d , i.e.  this reduces the resting length @xmath6 to @xmath29 as long as @xmath30 .",
    "therefore active contraction does not change the basic definition of the hsn and therefore in the following the actively contracting hsn is not discussed further .      for nodes within the network , the total force exerted on a node @xmath9",
    "is the sum of all forces applied by neighboring nodes @xmath10 : @xmath31 in mechanical equilibrium , the force on each non - adherent node has to vanish , @xmath32 .",
    "the existence of adhesion sites is modeled by fixing the positions of the adherent nodes .",
    "thus the adhesion site geometry will enter through the boundary conditions .    to reduce the number of parameters , we scale all lengths with respect to @xmath6 , e.g.  @xmath33 .",
    "all forces are scaled as @xmath34 .",
    "we define the ratio of active to elastic forces as @xmath35 for an acn we therefore may rewrite the forces acting on a node in the non - dimensionalized form as : @xmath36 in the computer simulations we use @xmath37 .",
    "mechanical equilibrium requires the forces on each non - adherent node to vanish @xmath38 with the summation @xmath10 over all neighbors . for a two - dimensional network of @xmath39 non - adherent nodes ,",
    "the system of equations ( [ system ] ) consists of @xmath40 coupled non - linear equations . if the lhs of system ( [ system ] ) consisted of arbitrary functions of the @xmath41 , the method of choice to solve it would be the newton - raphson method  @xcite .",
    "however , since the lhs of system ( [ system ] ) is a force which has a potential , it is also a @xmath40-dimensional gradient vector .",
    "therefore we solve the minimization problem for the potential with the conjugated gradient method  @xcite .",
    "we stop iterating as soon as the force on every node ( except the periphery nodes ) is smaller by at least two orders of magnitude than the smallest link force .      due to its dynamic and multiscale organization and the known limitations of microscopy , a detailed model of the actin cytoskeleton",
    "is currently out of bounds . in the face of these uncertainties ,",
    "our model is not meant to represent the details of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton .",
    "nevertheless , for practical purposes it is helpful to parametrize our model using some benchmark values for the actin cytoskeleton .",
    "the elastic modulus of an actin filament , which has cross - section area @xmath42 @xmath43 , was experimentally found to be @xmath44 @xmath45  @xcite , while typical values for stress fibers are a radius around @xmath46 @xmath47 ( corresponding to @xmath48 @xmath43 ) and an effective modulus of @xmath49 @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "hence , the young s modulus of stress fibers is three orders of magnitude smaller than the one of single actin filaments .",
    "this suggests that cross - linkers like @xmath51-actinin and myosin ii are the main contributors to elasticity and not the actin filaments themselves .",
    "however , the values for the one - dimensional modulus , @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath53 , are effectively very similar , so the one - dimensional modulus is expected to be of the order of @xmath55 @xmath53 .",
    "the mesh size of the cytoskeleton is expected to be typically around @xmath56 @xmath47 .",
    "this is an intermediate value introduced in  @xcite based on experimental observations of the actin cytoskeleton in adherent endothelial  @xcite and fibroblast cells  @xcite .",
    "for the active force , we estimate that around 1.000 myosin ii motors are active in one effective link . with a stall force of 2 pn per motor head",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath57 for the motor force per length . using and @xmath58 @xmath53",
    ", we estimate @xmath59 for the active tension in the network .",
    "and side length @xmath60 .",
    "( b ) triangular network with the same @xmath61 and @xmath62 . ]    in the following we analyze how the different types of networks act under tension for given adhesion constraints .",
    "we first discuss passive networks . in order to understand the role of geometry , as tension - free reference states we use both a square and a triangle as shown in .",
    "if the corners are fixed and the network is set under tension by reducing rest length , invaginated shapes appear as shown in for hookean spring networks ( hsn ) and passive cable networks ( pcn ) .",
    "contraction is quantified by @xmath63 . in ,",
    "the results for hsn and pcn are the same for the square shape , a , c , because these two kinds of networks behave identical as long as all links are tensed .",
    "however , the results are different for the triangle shape , b , d . in this case",
    ", the pcn gives a significantly flatter contour due to the missing response to compression in the thin extensions leading to the adhesion points .",
    "the most prominent examples for compressed links in b , d are indicated by arrows .    .",
    "the colorbar gives the dimensionless force @xmath64 .",
    "( a ) contraction of a hsn in the square reference state .",
    "( b ) equilibrium shape of a hsn in triangular reference state .",
    "( c ) pcn in square geometry .",
    "( d ) pcn in triangular geometry . for the triangular reference shape ,",
    "hsn ( b ) and pcn ( d ) differ in the amount of compression in the thin extensions ( marked by arrows ) . ]    in order to understand our numerical results in more detail , we first note that the hsn with triangular network topology has a well - defined continuum limit , in which it corresponds to a two - dimensional sheet with isotropic linear elastictiy @xcite .",
    "the two corresponding elastic constant are a young s modulus of @xmath65 and a poisson s ratio of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the spring constant of the links .",
    "the hsn with simple cubic topology does not have such a rigorous limit , but in our context it works in a similar way as the triangular lattice .",
    "therefore similar results as obtained here for the hsn are also obtained with continuum elasticity theory applied to two - dimensional cell shapes @xcite . without any adhesion constraint ,",
    "the hsn contracts isotropically to a finite size , i.e.  the network is uniformly scaled and has a new side length @xmath68 .",
    "this shape we call the unconstrained reference shape and it is key to understand the results for hsn .",
    "the same shape as shown in a results if the network contracts away from its initial state under adhesion constraints or if the network starts from its unconstrained reference state and its corners are dragged to the desired adhesion points .",
    "this explains the main feature of the force distribution shown by the color coding in a , namely the strong localization of stresses and strains to the regions around the adhesion points . with the amount of tension used here",
    ", the network can attain its unconstrained reference state away from the adhesion points and therefore its contour is essentially flat in the middle parts .",
    "( lower set ) and @xmath69 ( upper set ) .",
    "the straight line shows the unconstrained reference shape , while the three curved lines represent different initial link lengths , namely @xmath70 ( from bottom to top within one set ) .",
    "( b ) boundary line of the active cable network ( acn ) for the square shape for @xmath71 ( lower set ) and @xmath72 ( upper set ) . in this case , no unconstrained reference shape exists . the three lines again represent the initial link lengths @xmath73 ( from top to bottom ) . ]    in a we directly compare the calculated network shapes for the hsn for the square geometry to the unconstrained reference shape .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate the role of the link length @xmath61 . as explained above , in this case the pcn gives the same results .",
    "for the small value of tension , @xmath74 ( lower set ) , the contracting network can reach the unconstrained reference shape over a large region where it is therefore essentially flat .",
    "the smaller @xmath61 , the faster this contour is reached due to an increased force density along the contour . for the large value of tension , @xmath75 ( upper set )",
    ", the unconstrained reference shape is not reached by the contracted network and it stays non - flat along its whole contour even for rather small values of @xmath61 .    , the network collapses onto the center tree .",

    "next we turn to actively contracting networks . figs .",
    "[ cable_contr_hom]a - d show the equilibrium shapes of an active cable network ( acn ) with reference state from a and increasing tension @xmath78 . as tension increases ,",
    "the shape becomes more and more invaginated , until it collapses onto the zero - area network in d. this network basically consists of a centrally contracted region which is connected to the adhesion points by long extensions .",
    "we therefore call this network the center tree ( ct ) . note that this network still retains aspects of the two - dimensional network , because an effectively one - dimensional structure would collapse onto the so - called steiner tree of minimal length , which for a square shape is not four - fold symmetric @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the passive networks , where tension ceases as the unconstrained reference state is reached , for the acn no such unconstrained reference shape exists and without adhesion constraints the shape would collapse onto a single point .",
    "this explains why flat parts are not observed in the contours of the networks shown in a - d .",
    "this is also demonstrated in b , where we show contour shapes for @xmath71 ( lower set ) and @xmath72 ( upper set ) .",
    "like for the hsn in a , increasing lattice constant @xmath61 increases the force density along the contour and therefore leads to stronger invagination .",
    "however , in marked contrast to the hsn , no flat parts appear in the contour as no unconstrained reference state exists .",
    "a - d also shows that the formation of inward directed arcs now corresponds to a much more inhomogeneous density distribution of filaments : in the bulk of the network the distance between nodes and thus the filament density remains unchanged , while at the edges filaments start to bundle strongly along the edge .",
    "the color code in shows that stress is strongly localized at the periphery . in the interior , the only forces acting are the motor forces @xmath78 which balance each other at every node . at the periphery ,",
    "the force jumps up from @xmath78 to much higher values @xmath79 , compare a. the forces are largest close to the adhesion points and decrease towards the center of the boundary . for large tension @xmath80 , tubes are formed near the adhesion points and the stress distribution along the contour becomes more inhomogeneous .",
    "e shows the effect of changed discretization for the same tension value as a for the complete network .",
    "f demonstrates that for acn , shape and force values do not depend significantly on network topology . as an instructive example here we use a disordered network topology obtained by a voronoi construction .",
    "even the presence of relatively large elements in the discretization does not change the invaginated shape feature of the contracted network .",
    "we conclude from e and f that acn are surprisingly robust in regard to the details of the network topology . in general , similar results as obtained in for the square shape",

    "b we show the equilibrium shapes of the hsn from a and the acn from b with one adhesion point added in the middle of the bottom line . in the case of the acn model , this change at the bottom of the network has little influence on the positions of nodes not directly connected to the bottom line . in contrast , for the hsn the additional adhesion point affects the shape of the opposite arc , becoming more curved in the center . in c",
    "we plot by which distance @xmath81 the nodes in the vertical middle line are pulled down in the negative y - direction upon addition of the new adhesion point .",
    "the plot of @xmath88 versus @xmath83 is not smooth for numerical reasons , but clearly shows that the effect decays much more rapidly for the acn versus the hsn .",

    "intriguingly , stress in the contour behaves very differently , compare the color coding of a , b . while in the hsn stress in the bottom line stays approximately the same , in the acn it decreases to half its value , indicating a strong effect on contour forces .    in summary",

    "they are more robust in regard to network topology and adhesion geometry and show strong localization of the stress to the periphery .",

    "one can show that for small surface tension @xmath102 , the contour becomes parabolic with a radius of curvature @xmath164 .",
    "for @xmath165 the relative deviation to the prediction of the tem is only @xmath166 , that is in this regime , the elastic catenary model leads essentially to the same result as the tem with circular arcs .",

    "so far , we have treated the network links as cables or springs , in which force increases linearly with elongation .",
    "this implies that the elastic modulus of the network is independent of strain .",
    "however , it is well known that the cytoskeleton of cells shows a strong increase of elastic modulus with strain ( _ strain stiffening _ ) @xcite .",
    "this property of cytoskeletal networks has been reconstituted _ in vitro _ with crosslinked actin filaments of physiological length , which is of the order of their persistence length ( around 1 @xmath169 ) @xcite . under these conditions , strain stiffening results mainly from the mechanical properties of the crosslinkers . for larger filament lengths and stiff crosslinkers , there exists another mechanism for strain stiffening , namely the non - linear force - extension curve of semiflexible polymers as described by the worm - like - chain ( wlc ) model @xcite .",

    "tissue contraction with discrete pinning sites is very similar to cell contraction since adherent tissues also show invaginated arcs @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the spatial dimensions of the pinning objects tend to be relatively large .",
    "in order to include this effect , we have simulated a circular network contracting around four circular dots of finite size , see a. all nodes on the circles are fixed in space .",
    "motor force @xmath78 is increased stepwise and nodes coming closer to each other than @xmath214 are glued together and in the following act as one @xcite .",
    "relative dimensions are taken from @xcite , where a microtissue tethered to four cylindrical posts is analyzed . with the acn we are able to reproduce the typical arc morphology of the contracted microtissues , see b. we note that this is not possible with a fem approach , as this leads to flat contours as for hsn @xcite .",
    "thus acn are a useful model both for cells and tissues .",
    "motivated by the network nature of the actin cytoskeleton and its effectively 2d organization in mature adhesion to flat substrates , we have modeled adherent tissue cell contraction by 2d network models .",
    "the main aim of this work is to achieve a detailed comparison of the shapes and force patterns for different network types , namely hookean spring networks ( hsns ) , passive cable networks ( pcns ) , and active cable networks ( acns ) .",
    "the shape of a hsn can be understood best by considering the shape of its unconstrained reference shape .",
    "if tension is not too large , the network contour follows the unconstrained reference shape at regions sufficiently far away from the adhesion sites .",
    "closer to the adhesion sites , the network deforms and stress and strain accumulate .",
    "in contrast , the acn does not have an unconstrained reference shape and without adhesion constraints would contract into a point .",
    "therefore no signature of the unconstrained reference shape ( like flat parts for a square - shaped lattice ) appear in the contour .",
    "because it does not resist compression , stress and strain are not propagated much into the network and are strongly localized to the contour .",
    "one of the most striking difference between the different network types revealed by our analysis is the fact that in passive networks , local changes to the adhesion geometry changes the network globally .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the active network , where the addition of local adhesions has only a local effect on the boundary .",
    "however , in this case the change in spanning distance has a large effect on the stress in the contour , as predicted by the tension - elasticity model ( tem ) .",
    "the tem is especially suited to quantitatively predict the shape of an acn , namely the circular arcs observed between neighboring adhesion points and the scaling of their radius with spanning distance and surface tension .    despite this success",
    ", the tem does not capture all aspects of the network model .",
    "while the tem assumes constant contour tension , the computer simulations reveal that tension varies along the contour .",
    "an elastic catenary theory qualitatively predicts that tension decreases towards the middle of an invagination due to local changes in link density along the contour .",
    "however , it does neither predict the quantitative details of the contour stress nor the circular arc morphology .    in the case of very large tension , both network types develop different features . for the passive networks ,",
    "the invaginations tend to become more round , as the unconstrained reference shape becomes so small that the contour can not reach it anymore .",
    "in contrast , the active network develops straight features , because the network collapses into tubes at the adhesion points .",
    "indeed the formation of tubes has been observed experimentally and eventually leads to pearling through a rayleigh - plateau instability @xcite .",
    "the region between the tubes always stays circular for acn .",
    "network models are ideally suited for multi - scale modeling because physical properties can be easily added on the level of single link and lead to non - trivial effects on the level of cell shape and forces . in order to demonstrate this important aspect ,",
    "we have studied two important additional features of the cytoskeleton .",
    "first non - linear links were introduced via the worm - like - chain model ( wlc ) . in the wlc case the passive square network first contracts and then expands again as tension is increased .",
    "the acn requires much larger values of tension to contract compared to the linear case .",
    "otherwise the arc morphology is essentially the same as in the linear case .    as a biologically very relevant aspect of the cellular cytoskeleton",
    ", we also have studied the adaptation response of network links . for certain parameter values ,",
    "a saturation response for both elasticity and tension leads to a strong difference between @xmath106 and @xmath5 of boundary links , which are strongly increased , and @xmath106 and @xmath5 of internal links , which are increased much less .",
    "similar aspect have been addressed before in the framework of finite element modeling ( fem ) @xcite . in this case , the biochemical regulation has been modeled with more detail . both the resulting cell shapes and the formation of stress fibers inside the cell demonstrate that the fem model strongly resembles the hsn studied here",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to combine the detailed biochemical model with the actively contracting cable network studied here . while it appears to be very challenging to develop a homogenization strategy for the acn , it is interesting to consider if similar features as resulting from the acn could be obtained in a fem - framework .",
    "active cable networks have also been shown to describe the circular arc morphology of tissues pinned at discrete sites @xcite .",
    "because here arc radius also scales with spanning distance as for the arc radius of strongly adhering cells , the tension - elasticity model seems to capture all essential element of this situation . in the tissue case , the cable network represents the fibrous nature of the collagen matrix and the active contractility corresponds to cell contraction . because in addition water can flow out of the contracting cell - matrix composite , volume is not conserved and compression is not propagated .",
    "therefore the standard models of elasticity are strictly speaking not appropriate .",
    "indeed they do not predict the circular arc morphology , but rather show flat contours corresponding to the unconstrained reference shape of the elastic model @xcite .    in summary , hsn , pcn and acn are simple model systems which however show surprisingly rich responses to internal contractility and therefore lead to interesting conclusions about the physical elements required to endow cells with a sense of geometry .",
    "acn seem to be very appropriate to model strongly adherent tissue cells as they not only implement some of the most important fundamental features of the cytoskeleton ( asymmetry under tension and compression , contraction by molecular motors ) , but also lead to functions which are very reminiscent of real cells ( robustness under structural re - arrangements and adaptation to local adhesion constraints ) .",
