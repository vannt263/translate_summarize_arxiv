    "the spontaneous emergence of complex patterns is ubiquitous in nature .",
    "when faced against hostile environmental conditions , for example , bacterial colonies may exhibit very diverse morphological aggregation patterns .",
    "such conditions can be reproduced during _ in vitro _",
    "experiments on the surface of thin agar plates by using a very low level of nutrients , a hard surface ( high concentration of agar ) , or both .",
    "some species ( like the bacterium _ bacillus subtilis _ ) are known to exhibit a great variety of branching patterns depending on the nutrient concentration , softness of the medium , and temperature .",
    "for example , when inoculated on a nutrient - poor solid agar , the patterns show fractal morphogenesis similar to diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) ( see , e.g. , matsuyama and matsushita @xcite , and ben - jacob _ et al . _",
    "when inoculated on semi - solid agar ( softer medium ) the bacterial colonies exhibit a dense - branching morphology ( dbm ) with a smooth colony envelope propagating outward ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , when both nutrient and agar s softness further increase , the bacteria form simple circular patterns growing homogeneously ( cf . wakita _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . a detailed account and comparison of the different experimental results can be found in kawasaki _",
    "_ @xcite ( see also golding _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these experimental observations are usually summarized in a morphological diagram like the one shown in figure [ morphdiagram ] . the horizontal axis measures the medium softness expressed as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the agar concentration , and the vertical axis is the concentration of the nutrient @xmath2 .",
    "( vertical axis ) and the solidity of the agar medium expressed as @xmath0 ( horizontal axis ) . both concentrations are measured in grams per liter [ g / l ] .",
    "this diagram was redrawn from the one in @xcite . ]",
    "when the medium is very hard , the patterns are dla - like ( region a ) at low nutrient concentration , and round and compact with fractal boundary for high values of @xmath2 ( region b ) .",
    "dbm - like patterns arise in regions where the nutrient is poor and the agar softness is intermediate ( semi - solid ) , with an envelope smoothly rounded and moving outward ( region e ) . in region",
    "d , where the agar is softer and the nutrient is more abundant the dense branches fuse together forming homogeneous colonies with smooth boundaries . although susceptible of further improvements ( see , for example , wu , zou and jin @xcite ) , these diagrams provide a good macroscopic description of the colony patterns in terms of simple physical incubation conditions .    in order to explain the experiments ,",
    "many mathematical models have been proposed .",
    "one method of modeling is the continuous deterministic reaction - diffusion approach in which the bacterial density and the nutrient concentration are described with continuous time evolution systems of partial differential equations ( cf .",
    "murray @xcite ) . motivated by the experimental observations of ohgiwara _ et al .",
    "@xcite for dbm - like transition patterns between regions e and d in the morphology diagram ( see section [ seckawamodel ] below ) , kawasaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed in the mid-90 s a reaction - diffusion model with non - linear density - dependent degenerate ( cross ) diffusion coefficient , which captures many of the pattern features found experimentally .",
    "thanks to its capability of reproducing the complex dense morphology of patterns as well as its rich mathematical structure , this model has established itself as a well - known non - linear diffusion system in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .    there are , however , other phenomena which must be taken into consideration . bacterial chemotaxis ( that is , the process by which bacteria migrate toward higher concentrations of certain chemical fields ) has attracted significant interest due to its critical role in pattern formation ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "ben - jacob and co - workers ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) have suggested that the chemotactic response of the bacteria is essential to understand some of the fundamental features of the observed patterns . in particular , golding _",
    "@xcite discussed the experimental evidence and provided theoretical arguments favouring the introduction of chemotaxis towards high concentration of nutrients into many of the the reaction - diffusion models existing in the literature .",
    "although the authors did not propose a new chemotactic term for the particular model of kawasaki and collaborators , they certainly discussed what the relation between a generic diffusion term and the appropriate chemotaxis should be ( see section [ secrolechemo ] below ) .",
    "following these ideas , this paper incorporates a suitable nutrient chemotactic term into the original model by kawasaki _",
    "_ , and explores the effects that such chemical signaling brings upon the aggregation patterns . for that purpose ,",
    "we have conducted high resolution numerical simulations of the new system of equations using graphic processing units ( gpus ) to perform parallel computations .",
    "moreover , we were able to reproduce the results without chemotaxis and to compare them to the new emerging patterns when the chemical signaling is switched on .",
    "one of the main features of the new chemotactic term is an increase of the front propagation velocity for the colony envelope .",
    "such observation is justified using detailed front asymptotic calculations of the speed and the numerical results .",
    "we find that , except for a regime of soft agar and low nutrient , the chemotaxis does not modify the pattern colony structure significantly , providing evidence of the conjecture of cohen _ et al .",

    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ secmathmodel ] gives account of the original non - linear reaction - diffusion ( non - chemotactic ) model and introduces the chemotactic term into the equations .",
    "the resulting system is further normalized in order to reduce the number of parameters .",
    "section [ secnumerics ] contains the results of our numerical simulations , as well as a comparison of the observed patterns to those without chemotaxis . in order to explain the effects of the chemotactic terms , section [ secspeed ] contains an approximation of the speed of the envelope front using the ideas of geometric front propagation .",
    "furthermore , we provide a numerical estimation of the speed which approximates well the theoretical result , and compare it to the speed without chemotaxis .",
    "the estimations are supported by some theoretical calculations which can be found in [ secspeedcomp ] at the end of the paper .",
    "finally , in section [ secdiscussion ] , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we introduce the mathematical reaction - diffusion - chemotaxis model studied in this paper .",
    "we start by providing a detailed explanation of the original model in @xcite .      the model proposed by kawasaki _",
    "@xcite is a reaction - diffusion continuous system of partial differential equations that takes into account the detailed movement of the bacteria .",
    "the model has the following general form :    [ ka - model - dim ] @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the concentration of the nutrient and the density of the bacterial cells , respectively .",
    "we will denote every point in the domain as @xmath6 .",
    "here @xmath7 is a bounded domain and @xmath8 denotes time .",
    "this model assumes that the bacteria and the nutrient diffuse , with diffusion coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 is constant .",
    "the key feature of this model is the choice of the nonlinear diffusion coefficient @xmath9 , which depends on both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "its design was motivated by the work of ohgiwari _",
    "@xcite who investigated the patterns formed by _ b. subtilis _ on thin agar plates .",
    "they discovered that variations in the environmental conditions as well as in the concentrations of both nutrient and agar medium lead to drastic changes in the morphology of the colony patterns .",
    "they found two distinct type of growing processes .",
    "one is performed by immobile cells when the growth occurs on hard agar plates . in this case ,",
    "the outermost part of the colonies grows by cell division and cells in the inner part change into a dormant state .",
    "the other type of growth takes place for intermediate and low values of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the growth is produced by the movement of bacterial cells and , due to the softness of the agar , they can move around dynamically .",
    "the outermost front of the colonies is a boundary layer of cells whose movement is dull . but cells inside the layer move around actively and sometimes they break through the layer and immediately become dull .",
    "the bacteria inside the colonies are usually inactive .    in view of such experimental observations ,",
    "kawasaki and co - workers conjectured that the bacteria are immotile when either @xmath13 or @xmath12 are low and become active as @xmath13 or @xmath12 increase .",
    "therefore , they proposed @xmath9 as a non - linear ( cross ) diffusion function of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is constant and represent the agar concentration ( its value increases as the concentration of the agar decreases ) , whereas the parameter @xmath17 captures the random diffusion of the cells as a random fluctuation .    finally , the term @xmath18 is the consumption rate of the nutrient by the bacteria and @xmath19 is the growth rate of cells , being @xmath20 the conversion rate factor .",
    "it is assumed that the function @xmath21 is of michaelis - menten type , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are considered as constants . in the case",
    "when the concentration of the nutrient is low , the function can be approximated by @xmath25 the latter is the form of the kinetic function used by kawasaki and collaborators in their simulations , and the function that we consider in this paper as well .",
    "@xcite argue that the growth of bacterial colonies is an auto organization process which involves several mechanisms of chemotactic responses .",
    "they suggested that there are at least three different types of chemotactic signals .",
    "one of the signals is the result of nutrient ( or food ) attractive chemotaxis and it is the dominant signal in certain regimes of the nutrient level .",
    "another type of signal is a long range repulsive one , which is produced by the starving bacteria in the center of the colonies .",
    "the last type of signal is secreted by the bacteria in the front that are immersed in waste products .",
    "these bacteria ask for help to metabolize waste products by segregating a chemoattractant .",
    "the range of this signal is determined by the diffusion coefficient and the rate of decomposition .",
    "it is , in general , of short range .    when refering to bacterial colonies , golding _",
    "_ @xcite suggested that nutrient chemotaxis is the mechanism responsible of the increment in the growth speed and the control ( or even the decrease ) of the fractal dimension of the arising patterns .",
    "such process should permit to increase the propagation of the front .",
    "in view of these observations , we introduce a nutrient chemotactic term into system .",
    "for that purpose , we need to define the chemotactic flux @xmath26 which , in general , is written as @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the chemotactic sensitivity function and @xmath29 is the bacterial response to the nutrient gradient .",
    "the chemotactic signals are detected by dedicated membrane receptors which perform a binding between ligands ( attractors ) and specific binding proteins @xcite .",
    "bacteria sense temporal gradients , that is , they compare sequential registers of their occupied chemoreceptors @xcite .",
    "this complexity is built into the model equations through a signal - dependent chemotactic sensitivity function .",
    "one of the most commonly used forms is the `` receptor law '' proposed by lapidus and schiller @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant measuring the strength of the chemotaxis and @xmath32 is the receptor - ligand binding dissociation constant , which has nutrient concentration units , and represents the nutrient level needed for half of receptor to be occupied .",
    "this receptor sensitivity law has been derived and applied in several models for chemotaxis ( cf .",
    "its design was motivated by the experimental observation of mesibov , ordal and adler @xcite that for very high concentrations of nutrient the chemotactic response vanishes due to saturation of the receptors .",
    "this feature was not previously captured by the standard keller - segel chemotactic flux function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the functional form of can be understood in terms of a simple model for receptor - signal binding through the law mass action ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the dissociation constant @xmath33 for the attractor - receptor molecular interaction has a unique value that depends on the bacterial strain , nutrient type and other _ in vitro _",
    "conditions , and has to be determined experimentally ( see goldman and ordal @xcite for values of @xmath33 on various substrates of _ b. subtilis _ ) .",
    "moreover , it can be interpreted as the nutrient level where the chemotactic sensitivity @xmath34 is maximum .",
    "thus , we shall use @xmath33 as the normalization factor for the nutrient density @xmath13 .",
    "the bacterial response function @xmath35 is positive for attractive chemotaxis and negative for a repulsive one . in @xcite",
    "the authors suggest that , if the bacteria move within a liquid and the colony density is low , then the bacterial response should be proportional to the bacteria concentration times the diffusion , that is , latexmath:[\\[\\label{proposalchem }    diffusion coefficient is constant then the bacterial response function is proportional to @xmath12 , recovering in this case the classical keller - segel chemotactic flux @xcite .",
    "therefore , the authors suggest that , for general non - linear diffusion functions @xmath9 , the expression of the chemotactic flux @xmath26 must be modified according to in order to incorporate the density dependence of the bacterial movement .",
    "for example , for the non - linear diffusion considered by kitsunezaki @xcite , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 is constant and @xmath39 is an integer , they proposed @xmath40 as the appropriate response function .",
    "we now introduce a suitable chemotactic term into model expressing the chemical signaling of the nutrient concentration @xmath13 . in view of the form of the non - linear diffusion and taking into account , we propose the following ( attractive ) chemotactic flux @xmath41 where @xmath34 is the receptor law . substracting the divergence of such flux to the bacterial density equation in we obtain the following reaction - diffusion - chemotaxis model :    [ ka - chem - model - dim ] @xmath42    for @xmath43 , @xmath8 .",
    "the system is subject to initial conditions modeling an uniformly distributed initial constant concentration of nutrient and the initial inoculum of the bacteria .",
    "they have the form @xmath44 here @xmath45 is a positive constant and @xmath46 is a given function .",
    "the system ( [ ka - chem - model - dim ] ) is further endowed with no - flux boundary conditions , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is the outer unit normal vector at the boundary of the domain .",
    "system of equations adds the nutrient chemotactic signaling to model .",
    "the flux can be interpreted as the cross chemotactic function corresponding to the nonlinear diffusion .      in order to reduce the number of parameters in system we introduce the following rescaling of the variables : @xmath50 @xmath51 upon substitution into and dropping the tilded notation for simplicity",
    "we obtain the following dimensionless system of equations    [ ka - chem - model ] @xmath52    with @xmath53 , and with initial conditions @xmath54 for @xmath43 . to complete the system",
    "we impose no - flux boundary conditions on the rescaled variables @xmath55    the only remaining free parameters are @xmath56 , measuring the hardness of the agar medium ( large @xmath57 for low agar concentration ) ; @xmath58 , measuring the relative initial nutrient concentration ; and @xmath59 , which measures the intensity of the chemotaxis .    in the sequel",
    "we compute numerically the solutions to system under conditions and .",
    "we are particularly interested in the interplay between the different parameter values expressing agar concentration , initial nutrient and the chemotactic signal , and how they affect the colony patterns .",
    "we performed several numerical simulations of the system using an explicit second order runge - kutta and finite differences numerical scheme and the nvidia cuda libraries for the c++ programming language .",
    "the libraries are written to run on gpus , and the cuda programming language is designed under the simple program / multiple data ( spmd ) programming model ( cf .",
    "more specifically , the gpu architecture is very well - suited to address problems that can be expressed as data - parallel computations , that is , the same program ( finite difference calculations ) is executed on many data elements ( grid points ) simultaneously ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we overcome the inconvenience of small time steps required by explicit numerical schemes for solving stiff equations , and were able to accomplish thousands of iterations in a couple of hours .",
    "our numerical experiments were performed on a nvidia tesla@xmath60 c2070 graphics card with 448 cuda cores .",
    "the calculations were performed on a two dimensional square domain of side @xmath61 .",
    "the selected mesh for all our computations is a square grid of @xmath62 points per side ( see discussion on section [ secgridsize ] below ) .",
    "therefore , the grid width that we used was @xmath63 .",
    "we considered two values for the time step , namely , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for which the method showed to be stable .",
    "following @xcite and for the sake of comparison , the initial distribution for the bacteria was taken as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the maximum density at the center of the domain .",
    "recall that the initial condition for the nutrient is a fixed constant , for which we take the values @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "similarly as the computations in @xcite , and in order to incorporate the fact that bacteria move according to a biased random walk , on every grid point and at each time step the diffusion coefficient for the bacteria @xmath70 is perturbed from the mean @xmath57 through a random variable @xmath17 taken from a triangular distribution with support on @xmath71 $ ] , that is , @xmath72 .",
    "remember that @xmath57 represents the softness of the agar medium .    regarding the chemotactic term , the coefficient @xmath73 represents the strength of the signal .",
    "the simulations were performed using several values of this parameter including the value @xmath74 , that is , in the absence of chemotaxis .",
    "thus , we also computed solutions to the original system as well ( in its non - dimensional form ) also for the sake of comparison . for a complete summary of the free parameter values used during the numerical experiments ,",
    "see table [ tabresparam ] .",
    ".free parameter values used during the numerical simulations .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now present the numerical simulations of system subject to initial conditions and @xmath75 , as well as to boundary conditions .",
    "we divide the exposition of our numerical results in terms of the agar s hardness .",
    "the latter is expressed by the parameter value @xmath57 . in our simulations , we considered the values @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and the observed patterns correspond to regions e and d in the morphology diagram ( see the enclosed region inside a rectangle in figure [ morphdiagram ] ) .",
    "for @xmath78 we took the time step @xmath64 and for @xmath79 we took it as @xmath65 .",
    "the computed solutions are represented in figures [ fig : set1 ] through [ fig : set4 ] .",
    "each figure contains two columns associated to two different values of the parameter @xmath73 , and each row is associated to a different time step .",
    "such configuration allows the reader to compare the colony patterns for different chemotactic intensities . in what follows we highlight that the main effect of the chemotaxis is the increment on the growth speed of the outer envelope of the bacterial colony",
    "we begin with the case of semi - solid agar , for which @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the concentration of agar is intermediate and the diffusion of the bacteria is limited .",
    "the observed patterns correspond to the dbm - like branching structure in region e of the morphology diagram .",
    "the considered values for the initial nutrient level were @xmath80 and @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ fig : set1 ] shows the numerical calculations for @xmath68 . on the left column",
    "we find the solutions to the system in the absence of chemotaxis , that is , when @xmath74 .",
    "the pictures for this case are comparable to those obtained by kawasaki _",
    "( see figure 3(b ) in @xcite ) . on the right column we find the case where the chemotactic sensitivity is set as @xmath81 .",
    "the morphology shown in both cases is very similar ( if we look carefully we can see that the number of branches is consistent ) .",
    "there is , however , a significant increase in the growth velocity of the outer envelope of the branches when the chemotactic signal is switched on , as the reader may observe .",
    "the simulations for @xmath82 are depicted in figure [ fig : set2 ] .",
    "once again the left column corresponds to the value @xmath74 .",
    "the patterns are defined by fine radially oriented branches with round envelope . at the center of the colony",
    "there is the highest concentration of bacteria .",
    "actually , the peak concentration is the remainder of the initial inoculation , because the bacteria at early times deplete the nutrient in site of the initial condition , but the cells in the inner part of the colony become immotile .",
    "meanwhile , the cells at the periphery of the colony move actively searching for higher concentrations of nutrient ; this is what drives the formation of branches .",
    "hence , bacteria at the front of the colony account for the instability at the interface .",
    "this is the main feature of the non - linear cross diffusion model . in the right column of figure",
    "[ fig : set2 ] we find the patterns in the presence of a chemotactic signal ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we observe that at early stages ( see figure [ set2b ] ) the chemotaxis provides a significant outward drift to the cellular movement as discussed in @xcite , causing a more ramified pattern with round envelope and a substantial enhancement of growth speed",
    ". comparing figures [ set2 g ] and [ set2h ] we notice that the chemotactic signal produced a pattern two times bigger ( the envelope is moving faster ) .      in our next numerical experiment",
    ", we set the value @xmath77 , causing the diffusion of the bacteria to be increased by lowering the concentration of the agar . at sufficient high levels of nutrient the colony patterns",
    "are restricted to region d in the morphology diagram , whereas at lower levels of @xmath84 patterns in region e emerge . in order to explore the morphology transitions between regions",
    "d and e , we first set @xmath68 as the initial nutrient and consider various values for @xmath73 , because the chemotactic signal gives rise to a outward drift to the cellular movement .",
    "the computations are depicted in figures [ fig : set3a ] and [ fig : set3b ] . in this experiment",
    ", the comparison is made through the two figures , for which the initial nutrient is fixed and the chemotactic sensitivity takes the values @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in figure [ fig : set3a ] , the left column shows the evolution of the system without chemotaxis . at early times",
    "the bacteria evolve as a solid colony ( figure [ set3aa ] ) , but for the consequent iterations they develop a pattern of radially oriented fjords .",
    "on the right column of figure [ fig : set3a ] we show the results with chemotactic strength @xmath87 .",
    "as expected , the chemotactic term makes the colony grow faster ; compare , for example , figures [ set3af ] and [ set3ag ] .",
    "observe that the pictures in the two columns of figure [ fig : set3a ] ( with chemotactic sensitivities @xmath74 and @xmath88 ) exhibit similar morphologies , being the envelope velocity the only apparent difference between them .    for higher values of @xmath73",
    ", however , the growth speed is not only greatly increased , but there is also a change in the morphologies as well .",
    "we may appreciate , for instance , that for @xmath89 the colony has almost doubled its size at time step @xmath90 ( see figures [ set3ag ] and [ set3bh ] ) . in this case",
    "the increment on the growth speed is accompanied by a notable morphological change .",
    "presumably , at higher values of @xmath73 the propagation speed of the front is higher than the diffusion of the nutrient preventing the fjords from forming .",
    "therefore , the thin branches start fusing ( figure [ set3bg ] ) until the pattern shows no more branches and becomes an homogeneous disk ( figure [ set3bh ] ) .",
    "these observations suggest that , in the transition between regions e and d in the morphology diagram , the supressing effect of the chemotactic term on the onset of instability ( which causes the formation of branches ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) is more evident than in other regions of the diagram .",
    "an increase of the chemotactic intensity prevents the formation of further branches and results in an homogeneization of the colony morphology , accompanied with the expected increase in the velocity of the overall colony .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : set4 ] we present the results of our numerical simulations for the value of nutrient @xmath91 and chemotaxis sensitivities @xmath74 and @xmath89 . in this case",
    "no significant morphological changes are observed . in the left column of figure",
    "[ fig : set4 ] the pattern shown is an homogeneous disk with a peak of bacterial concentration at the center . in the right column",
    "( when @xmath89 ) , as expected , it is observed that the chemotactic signal increases the growth speed and the pattern is also a slightly rugged solid disk , but with a small depression at the center . the latter happens because the softness of the agar allows the colony to spread out before the nutrient is depleted . in this case ( which correspons to region d in the diagram ) , we notice the increment in the outer colony velocity with no significant change in morphology .",
    "it has been suggested that numerical simulations might depend on the grid size @xcite . to circumvent this possibility , we performed simulations with the following grid sizes as well : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the results for the parameter values @xmath78 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be observed in figure [ fig : tmalla ] for each grid size . notice that in the case of @xmath96 points per side , the solutions exhibit a cross shaped pattern with a rhomboid envelop ( figure [ 1k ] ) . when the grid size is increased to @xmath97",
    "there is indeed a significant change in morphology , showing a denser branching pattern with a round envelope ( figure [ 2k ] ) .",
    "this pattern does not change significantly , however , when the size grid is increased to @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( figures [ 4k ] and [ 8k ] ) .",
    "the reader may notice that figures [ 2k ] , [ 4k ] and [ 8k ] show very similar patterns .",
    "we conclude that a resolution of @xmath97 lies above the threshold needed for a reliable display of the solutions of the system .",
    "even though our computations were performed with parallelization techniques on a gpu , the simulations with @xmath99 involved a large computational time ( there are more than 64 million grid points ) .",
    "therefore , we adopted @xmath97 as the resolution for all the simulations of system in this paper",
    ".     +   +",
    "in this section we discuss the effects of the chemotactic term on the envelope propagation speed by means of an asymptotic geometric front approximation .",
    "moreover , we provide numerical estimations of the speed by simulating a one dimensional version of system .",
    "we compare these velocity calculations to those without chemotaxis .      for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the chemotactic sensitivity function as a constant , i.e. , @xmath100 .",

    "they observed that in the absence of diffusion the total mass is conserved . in our setting , if we ignore both diffusion and chemotaxis then we can add the equations and integrate them in time to obtain @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a constant , which will be taken as @xmath104 .",
    "thus , @xmath105 and we obtain the logistic equation @xmath106    it must be observed that in @xcite the term @xmath107 is substituted by @xmath108 , and the term @xmath109 is substituted by @xmath110 , in the approximation of the system by a scalar equation for @xmath12 .",
    "instead , we are substituting ( [ mass - conser ] ) into ( [ velo - bact ] ) to obtain a scalar equation for @xmath12 .",
    "this not only represents a more accurate approximation but it is also consistent with the numerical computations which , at first order , show that the conservation - like equation is valid away from the front .    substitution of ( [ mass - conser ] ) into ( [ velo - system ] ) yields the scalar equation @xmath111 which is an approximated scalar equation for @xmath12 with a fisher - type reaction term . here we have approximated @xmath112 , because in this part of the study we are not interested in considering the random motion of bacteria .",
    "a rearrangement of the terms in equation allows us to write the two divergence terms together .",

    "our numerical simulations of system show that the chemotactic term provides an outward drift to the bacterial movement and therefore enhances the growth velocity of the bacterial patterns .    in order to approximate the velocity of the envelope front , under suitable assumptions , we derived a scalar equation of the bacterial density , see equation .",

    "finally , we discuss the relation of our results to the analysis of arouh and levine @xcite , who studied the kessler - levine reaction - diffusion equations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and explored the addition of a nutrient chemotactic term .",
    "they found that the chemotaxis suppresses the onset of instability causing the formation of branching patterns in the colony envelope as it propagates outward .",
    "this suppression of instability is reflected in a decrease of the `` growth rate '' of the perturbation of the envelope when the chemotaxis is switched on .",
    "the authors conjecture that this behavior can be extrapolated to other ( more realistic ) chemotactic models like the one introduced in this paper .",
    "it is to be pointed out , however , that our findings do not contradict the analysis of arouh and levine inasmuch as our numerical simulations and analytic computations exhibit an increase in the normal velocity of the envelope outward due to the chemotaxis , whereas the growth rate that arouh and levine refer to is the temporal eigenvalue associated to an eigenfunction ( perturbation ) of the linearized operator around the envelope front .",
    "actually , a simple calculation using energy estimates ( not included here ) shows that in the case of our model , the spectral bounds for the eigenvalues of the linearized operator around the envelope front indeed decrease as functions of the chemotactic sensitivity .",
    "our results and the observations of arouh and levine combined suggest that , although the speed of the envelope front increases with the chemotaxis ( as it is shown in this paper ) , the growth rate of linear perturbations of the envelope is pushed to the stable ( negative ) region of the spectrum , delaying the formation of fingering unstable patterns ( as it is shown in @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we summarize the theoretical results of malaguti and marcelli @xcite that allow us to justify why the speed of the envelope front is greater when there is a chemotactic signal .",

    "they prove the theorem by showing that the existence of such a traveling wave is equivalent to the existence of a solution @xmath172 of the boundary - value problem @xmath173 for the the same @xmath168 , satisfying @xmath174 of all @xmath175 .",
    "the result can be easily extrapolated to a one - dimensional equation of the form @xmath176 on @xmath177 $ ] and where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are defined in equations and , respectively .",
    "the existence of a traveling front solution to the equation with @xmath139 is related to the solution to the boundary value problem @xmath180 likewise the traveling wave without chemotaxis is linked to the solutions to the problem @xmath181    in order to compare the speed of the envelope front in both cases , we consider the following sets @xmath182 @xmath183 that define the range of values of @xmath168 for which there exists a traveling wave solution for equation ( see theorem 9 in @xcite ) .",
