    "<S> we perform an extensive analysis of neutrino diffusion in quark matter within the mit bag model at arbitrary temperature and degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> we examine in detail the contribution of each of the relevant weak interaction processes to the total neutrino opacity and evaluate the effect of the strange quark mass , the bag constant , and the qcd perturbative corrections to the mit bag model . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the anisotropic contribution to the neutrino distribution function in scatterings , the mean energy transfer and the mean scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> the density and temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients @xmath0 that govern the cooling and deleptonization of a compact star is shown in detail . finally , </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results for the neutrino mean free paths are compared against known analytic approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that neutrino scattering constitutes a significant portion of the total neutrino opacity in leptonized quark matter and neutrino - quark scattering is , in general , very similar to neutrino - electron scattering with respect to both mean energy transfer per scattering and mean scattering angle . </S>"
