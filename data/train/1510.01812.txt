    "with the rapid evolution of wireless communications systems , handheld mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets , have become one of the primary means to access the internet . since these devices",
    "are powered by battery with finite capacity , they need to be frequently plugged into the power grid for recharging , which greatly affects the user experience . as such , in an effort to prolong the operational duration of mobile devices , energy harvesting techniques , which scavenge energy from natural resources such as solar and wind , were proposed @xcite .",
    "ideally , this would allow for perpetual operational time .",
    "nevertheless , the inherent randomness as well as the intermittent property of nature resources makes stable energy output an extremely challenging task .",
    "hence , it may not be suitable for wireless services with stringent quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements .",
    "one of the promising solutions to address the above limitation is to employ radio frequency ( rf ) signals - based energy harvesting , which can provide stable energy supply , because sufficient level of control over the transmission of rf signals is possible @xcite . since rf signals can carry both energy and information , a new research area , referred to as simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) , has recently emerged and has captured the attention of the research community .",
    "the pioneering works of varshney @xcite and grover et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the fundamental tradeoff between the capacity and harvested energy for swipt systems .",
    "furthermore , practical architectures for swipt systems were proposed in @xcite , where the optimal transmit covariance achieving the rate - energy region was derived . later in @xcite , the effect of imperfect channel state information ( csi )",
    "was considered , while sophisticated architectures improving the rate - energy region were proposed in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the applications of swipt in orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) systems and multiuser systems were considered in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the point - to - point communication systems , the application of swipt in cooperative relaying networks has also been under extensive investigation @xcite .",
    "specifically , nasir et al . in @xcite studied the throughput performance of an amplify - and - forward ( af ) half - duplex relaying system for both time - switching and power - splitting protocols , while @xcite considered performance of the full - duplex relaying systems .",
    "ding et al . in @xcite",
    "considered the power allocation strategies for decode - and - forward ( df ) relaying system with multiple source - destination pairs .",
    "a novel and low - complexity antenna switching protocol was proposed in @xcite to realize swipt .",
    "relay selection was considered in @xcite , while the impact of multi - antenna relay was investigated in @xcite , and extension to the two - way relaying was studied in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the performance of energy harvesting cooperative networks with randomly distributed users / relays was studied in @xcite .    in all above - mentioned papers , an integrated base station ( bs ) architecture is assumed , which acts simultaneously as the information source and energy source .",
    "however , due to the huge gap on the operational sensitivity level between the information decoder ( in the order of -100 dbm ) and the energy harvester ( in the order of -10 dbm ) , it is only feasible for the bs to power mobile devices within short distance ( e.g. , less than 10 meters ) @xcite . as such , to enable a full network support for swipt , the bs should be deployed in extremely high density ( e.g. , the cell radius of a bs should be in the range of 10 - 15 meters ) , which would incur enormous cost and hence is deemed impractical . responding to this , huang and lau proposed in @xcite a novel network architecture , where dedicated stations referred to as power beacons ( pb ) are overlaid with a cellular network to power mobile devices .",
    "since the pb does not require any backhaul connections , the associated cost of pb deployment is much lower , hence , dense deployment of pb to ensure network coverage for swipt is practical . in @xcite ,",
    "the requirement on the coupled relationship between the pb and bs densities under an outage probability constraint was characterized , which provides useful guidelines for the design of practical wireless powered communications networks .",
    "different from the work in @xcite , which focuses on a large scale network , this work can be viewed as the small scale counterpart . in particular",
    ", we consider a point - to - point communication link , where the source is powered by a dedicated pb .",
    "the time splitting approach is adopted , i.e. , first , the source harvests the energy from the pb , and then performs information transmission with the harvested power .",
    "the main objective of this work is to understand the fundamental limit of wireless powered communication links and characterize the impact of key system parameters on the system performance . to this end , we analyze the average throughput of two different transmission modes , namely , _",
    "delay tolerant _ and _ delay intolerant_. for both modes , we also investigate the optimal time splitting policy maximizing the average throughput .",
    "finally , the impact of co - channel interference is also studied .",
    "the main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows :    * considering the noise limited scenario , we present exact closed - form expressions of the average throughput for both the delay intolerant and the delay tolerant transmission modes .",
    "in addition , simplified analytical approximations are also provided for special cases , such as in the high power regime and for large number of antennas , based on which , closed - form solutions are derived for the optimal time split maximizing the average throughput . *",
    "considering the interference plus noise scenario , we present an exact integral expression for the average throughput for the delay intolerant transmission mode , and tight throughput bounds for both transmission modes .",
    "numerical and simulation results have shown that putting more antennas at the pb would significantly improve the system throughput .",
    "this is rather intuitive , since the more the antennas , the sharper the energy beam , which in turns yields higher energy efficiency .",
    "in addition , the findings confirm the dual roles of co - channel interference , i.e. , it can be either beneficial or detrimental , depending on the propagation environment and system setup .",
    "moreover , it was revealed that the impact of fading severity level of the energy transfer link on the throughput is not significant , especially if the number of pb antennas is large .",
    "finally , it was shown that the source position has a significant impact on the average throughput .",
    "for the noise only scenario , the throughput is a symmetric function of the source position , and the worse case occurs when the source is located at the middle of the pb and destination , while the best case appears when the source moves close to either the pb or destination . on the other hand , for the interference plus noise scenario ,",
    "the throughput is no longer a symmetric function of the source position , since the optimum position of the source depends on both the source transmit power and interference power .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides an detailed introduction of the considered system model .",
    "section iii presents some preliminary mathematical results .",
    "section iv studies the throughput performance of noise only scenario , while section v deals with the interference plus noise scenario .",

    "the line - of - sight path is likely to exist between the pb and s , hence , it is a natural choice to use the rician distribution in order to model the pb to s channel .",

    ", it is well known that the nakagami - m fading distribution provides a very good approximation to the rician distribution .",

    "we observe that , for the noise only scenario , the throughput is a symmetric function of @xmath18 and @xmath42 , and interestingly , we see that the worst case appears when s is located at the middle point .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the effective snr is determined by @xmath178 as shown in ( [ snr : noise ] ) which attains the maximum value when @xmath179 . on the other hand , in the presence of interference ,",

    "in addition , with a larger @xmath19 , the detrimental effect of the interference caused at the destination is substantially diminished .",
