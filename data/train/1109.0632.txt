    "a quarter century has passed since the unexpected discovery by george bednorz and alex mueller @xcite of high temperature superconductivity in doped cuprate insulators .",
    "their breakthrough radically altered the field of superconductivity and awoke it from a long period of reduced activity .",
    "the great theoretical breakthrough of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) occurred some thirty years previously .",
    "their bcs microscopic theory of superconductivity caused by a weak electron - electron attraction arising through the exchange of phonons , in one fell swoop turned superconductivity from the most puzzling and mysterious into the best understood phenomenon in metals .",
    "but by the mid - eighties the last details of bcs theory had long been worked out and the highest known transition temperature had languished slightly above @xmath0 for many years .",
    "even a value of 30k was looking decidedly optimistic .",
    "the initial measurements on cuprates @xcite reached only @xmath1 values in the upper thirties , but this clear jump from the low twenties and the fact , quickly recognized by p. w. anderson @xcite , that the superconductivity appeared in a lightly doped mott insulator led him to propose that this was a radically different form of superconductivity . in a mott insulating state",
    "the onsite coulomb repulsion between electrons scales to strong coupling , localizing electrons and dominating the physics on the low energy scale , opposite to the case of conventional superconductors .",
    "p. w. anderson in his early paper @xcite went much further .",
    "he realized that the relevant element in the cuprates is the cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "in the parent undoped mott insulator , the cu@xmath3 ions form an antiferromagnetically ( af ) coupled square lattice of @xmath4=1/2 spins , which could possibly realize the resonant valence bond ( rvb ) liquid of singlet spin pairs . in a rvb state the large energy gain of the singlet pair state , resonating between the many spatial pairing configurations , drives strong quantum fluctuations  strong enough to suppress long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "further he showed that the rvb wavefunction could be expressed also as a gutzwiller projected bcs pair wavefunction . in the undoped state the gutzwiller projector , which acts to enforce single occupancy on each site , localizes an electron in a half - filled band with a @xmath4=1/2 moment on every lattice site , leading to a mott insulator .",
    "hole doping allows electrons to move through empty sites and introduces charge fluctuations of the singlet pairs and superconductivity .",
    "this elegant scenario in our view remains to this day to be the most compelling intuitive picture of the spectacular superconductivity of cuprates @xcite .",
    "later refinements change a number of details .",
    "the parent insulators are actually af ordered , but with the sublattice moment reduced by strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "the pairs are in a relative _ d_-wave not _ s_-wave configuration .",
    "but these modifications do not change the essence of anderson s rvb picture .    to proceed further , we need an explicit model hamiltonian to describe the low energy physics .",
    "the cu - ions have 4 nearest neighboring ( nn ) o - neighbors in the plane and usually , though not always , apical o neighbors lying further away above and/or below the cuo@xmath5 plane . in this configuration the uppermost band is associated with the antibonding @xmath6 cu  @xmath7 o orbital lying in the plane . in density",
    "functional ( lda ) band structure calculations @xcite this band is half filled and lies isolated above the other 3d and 2p bands .",
    "the lda calculations give a metallic ground state so a strong short range coulomb repulsion needs to be added to obtain the observed mott insulator in the undoped compounds .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian consists of a single band with both nn and next nearest neighboring ( nnn ) hopping matrix elements in a tight binding representation and an onsite repulsion .",
    "this hubbard hamiltonian is a good starting point if we start from the strongly hole doped side of the cuprate phase diagram . in this limit",
    "a full fermi surface in good agreement with the lda results has been determined in angle resolved photoemission emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite and quantum oscillation experiments @xcite . if we start from the other limit , namely strongly underdoped cuprates , it is convenient to integrate out high - energy configurations .",
    "this procedure was applied by zhang and rice @xcite directly to the overlapping @xmath6 cu ",
    "@xmath7 o orbitals in the cuo@xmath5 plane .",
    "they showed that doped holes enter a spin singlet cu@xmath8 oxidation state and move through a background of @xmath9 cu@xmath3 ions , thereby justifying a @xmath10 model similar to the strong coupling limit of the hubbard model .",
    "these single band hubbard and @xmath10 models on a square lattice look at first glance to be deceptively straightforward .",
    "in fact we are dealing with a strongly interacting fermion model , which can not be expanded perturbatively in a small parameter around a well - described limit .",
    "the analysis of this strongly correlated model poses a clear challenge to theory .",
    "the phase diagram of the cuprates is by now quite well established .",
    "the two limits of a standard landau fermi liquid metallic state at strong overdoping and an af ordered mott insulator in the parent stoichiometric compound , are well understood . in between as schematically illustrated in fig.[fig : phase - diagram ] , we are faced with a complex evolution as the full fermi surface at overdoping , evolves as the doping is reduced and disappears completely at zero doping .    starting from the overdoped side of the phase diagram , two changes appear as the hole density is reduced from the standard metallic state .",
    "superconductivity appears with _ d_-wave pairing symmetry below a critical hole density .",
    "the normal state also changes . in a recent series of experiments , nigel hussey and collaborators studied the angle dependent magnetoresistance oscillations ( amro ) on single layer tl - cuprates in a high magnetic field @xcite",
    " high enough to suppress superconductivity and follow the normal state down to low temperatures . from these amro experiments they determined the temperature ( @xmath11 ) and angular dependence of the inelastic scattering rate around the fermi surface .",
    "they found that the onset of superconductivity coincided with the onset of a strongly anisotropic linear in t term in the inelastic scattering rate .",
    "the anisotropic inelastic scattering rate causing the breakdown of the standard landau @xmath12-behavior , peaks in the antinodal directions and implies the presence of an anomalous and anisotropic strong scattering vertex for low energy quasiparticles connecting these antinodal regions in @xmath13-space . as will be discussed later such anomalous behavior was foreshadowed by functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculations on a single band hubbard model a decade earlier @xcite    starting from the undoped side a @xmath10 model describes the doped mott insulator as a dilute density of holes moving in a background of an af coupled square lattice of @xmath4 = 1/2 spins .",
    "the motion of a hole rearranges the spin configuration leading to strong coupling between the two degrees of freedom . in the past two decades",
    "many methods , both numerical and analytical , have been employed to analyze this @xmath10 model , e.g. renormalized mean field theories ( rmft ) and numerical monte carlo sampling of variational wavefunctions ( vmc ) for gutzwiller projected fermionic wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "another set of theories implements the gutzwiller constraint in terms of a gauge theory and slave boson formulation or a slave fermion and schwinger boson formulation .",
    "these methods have been extensively reviewed in a series of recent articles by lee , nagaosa and wen @xcite , edegger , muthukumar and gros @xcite , lee @xcite , and ogata and fukuyama @xcite .",
    "an earlier review by dagotto covered numerical approaches @xcite and a survey of the current status of various theories has recently been published by abrahams @xcite . in this review",
    "we will not cover these approaches again and refer the reader instead to these comprehensive reviews .",
    "these approaches successfully explain the suppression of long range af order as holes are introduced",
    ". one issue , which remains open , concerns the possible coexistence of _ d_-wave superconductivity and long range af order .",
    "earlier experiments found an intermediate region with a disordered spin glass separating the two ordered phases but recently nmr experiments on multilayer hg - cuprates have been interpreted as evidence for coexistence of both broken symmetries @xcite .",
    "the multilayered hg - cuprates are undoubtedly cleaner especially in the inner layers , than the acceptor doped single layer cuprates but suffer from the complications of interlayer coupling between adjacent cuo@xmath2 planes with different hole densities .    beyond a critical hole density",
    "the so called pseudogap phase appears  the most puzzling and anomalous region of the phase diagram .",
    "a comprehensive review of the unusual experimental results that appear in this phase was written by timusk and statt a decade ago @xcite .",
    "the anomalous behavior was first observed in early nmr experiments on underdoped cuprates , which showed a dramatic drop in the uniform spin susceptibility deduced from knight shift data @xcite .",
    "this drop is too large to be explained by the onset of af spin correlations and instead is evidence for singlet pair formation , in line with the central thesis of the rvb theory .",
    "another spectacular anomaly that characterizes the pseudogap phase appeared in arpes experiments .",
    "they showed that the full fermi surface in the overdoped region shrinks down to 4 fermi arcs , centered on each nodal direction @xcite in the underdoped region .",
    "these fermi arcs mean there is only a partial gapping of the fermi surface hence the name pseudogap .",
    "we will not review here the full experimental characterization of the pseudogap phase and instead refer the reader to the review by timusk and statt @xcite .",
    "this gives a complete account of the experiments up till a decade ago . in recent years further experiments particularly arpes , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and quantum oscillation ( qo )",
    "experiments have expanded this characterization substantially . these will be discussed later when we come to the comparison between experiment and the phenomenological theory that is the main thrust of this review .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the whole range of anomalous phenomena that appear in the pseudogap phase is clearly a big challenge .",
    "what is required is a consistent theoretical description that covers the full range and variety of the anomalous experimental results .",
    "while there has been considerable progress on the analysis based directly on the @xmath10 and hubbard hamiltonians , at present , one is far short of this ambitious goal . in this review",
    "we will be less ambitious .",
    "our aim is to obtain a comprehensive theory based on a phenomenological approach .",
    "a key element is an ansatz for the single electron propagator put forward a few years ago by yang , rice and zhang @xcite .",
    "this yrz ansatz interpolates between the frg results @xcite , which describe the breakdown of standard landau fermi liquid behavior as the hole density is reduced in the overdoped metal , and the rmft for the rvb @xcite behavior at underdoping .",
    "the success of any phenomenological approach is measured by its ability to interrelate the wide variety of anomalous phenomena and to develop intuition about the physics underlying the pseudogap phase .",
    "below we review our recent progress in testing the yrz ansatz against a series of spectroscopic measurements  arpes investigations @xcite , particularly those showing particle - hole asymmetry along the fermi arcs @xcite , aipes ( angle integrated pes ) @xcite results on the hole density of states across the pseudogap region , and stm measurements analyzing quantum interference to obtain the fermi arcs underlying the coherent bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra at low temperatures in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "recently carbotte , nicol and coworkers @xcite have used the yrz ansatz to analyze a series of experiments in the pseudogap phase .",
    "they obtained good fits to the evolution of in - plane optical conductivity @xcite , the specific heat @xcite , london penetration depth @xcite and raman scattering @xcite with changing doping and temperature in the pseudogap phase .",
    "raman scattering experiments were also analyzed earlier by bascones and valenzuela @xcite .",
    "these fits require different dependences for the antinodal rvb gap and the maximum superconducting gap on the fermi arcs .",
    "these differences are central to the two - gap scenario , which has been discussed by many authors .",
    "for a recent review see hufner et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analysis by konik , rice and tsvelik ( krt ) @xcite of fermi pockets in a 2-dimensional array of 2-leg hubbard ladders at weak coupling and densities near half - filling , was also an important input in the yrz ansatz .",
    "recently krt extended their analysis to arrays of 4-leg hubbard ladders @xcite . in this case in a certain parameter range , they derived a low energy model with small fermi pockets coupled to finite energy _",
    "d_-wave cooperons associated with gapped regions in @xmath14-space .",
    "they suggested that such models have a wider validity and are relevant to the cuprates .",
    "related suggestions were made earlier on the basis of frg calculations on the 2-dimensional hubbard model @xcite .",
    "other interesting systems which show closely related behaviour are the wide hubbard ladders with many legs , recently reviewed by lehur and rice @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss further below , these analyses of related models suggest there is scope to further develop the phenomenological model to better describe the interrelationship between _ d_-wave superconductivity and af fluctuations in the cuprates .",
    "the close interplay between these two is at the heart of the rvb proposal .",
    "the recent discovery that the static stripe phase , that occurs most prominently in la@xmath15ba@xmath16cu@xmath5o@xmath17 at @xmath18 @xcite , consists of spatially oscillating superconductivity coexisting with charge and spin density waves demonstrates just how subtle this interplay is .",
    "an outline of the review follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the approach from overdoping concentrating on the manner in which the landau fermi liquid description at large doping breaks down as the pseudogap phase is approached .",
    "a summary of the general features of the pseudogap phase appears in section 3 .",
    "the yrz ansatz for the single particle propagator is introduced in section 4 with a comparison to recent spectroscopic measurements . in section 5 the comparison to experiment is further developed with a review of the recent calculations applying the yrz ansatz to describe anomalous properties of the pseudogap phase .",
    "the ansatz has implications for the underlying microscopic theory of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the pseudogap phase , which are summarized in section 6 .",
    "there are many theoretical proposals for the pseudogap phase and a comparison to several which are closest to the current theory is the subject of section 7 .",
    "the conclusions of the review are in section 8 .",
    "we start the discussion of the cuprate phase diagram in the overdoped region and examine how the standard landau fermi liquid state found in heavily overdoped cuprates breaks down as the hole density , @xmath19 , is reduced .",
    "the onset of superconductivity in a fermi liquid is caused by a divergence of the particle - particle scattering amplitude in the cooper channel .",
    "the cuprates however show more complex behavior as the highly anomalous pseudogap state is approached when @xmath19 is reduced away from the overdoped region of the phase diagram .",
    "a key question then is what is the form of the additional divergent scattering processes that signal the breakdown of landau theory associated with the crossover into the pseudogap phase .",
    "identifying these additional scattering processes gives valuable insight into the physics of the anomalous pseudogap phase .      in the overdoped region of the phase diagram ,",
    "the effects of the onsite repulsion are less dramatic than in the underdoped region , so that a single band hubbard model description with moderate interactions may be an appropriate starting point . in analyzing the hubbard model",
    "it is important to use a method that treats all the possible instabilities in an unbiased manner .",
    "this is necessary if we want to identify the instabilities that drive the anomalous pseudogap phase that appears as the hole density crosses into the underdoped region .",
    "a second desirable feature is good resolution in @xmath13-space since we want to examine the fate of the @xmath13-space fermi surface and the _ d_-wave pairing instability in the cooper channel .",
    "the functional renormalization group ( frg ) method satisfies both requirements .",
    "it is however limited to moderate values of the interaction by the one loop approximation which is very difficult to improve on .",
    "but this limitation as we shall see , still allows a reasonable , if fully quantitative , description of the breakdown of landau theory .",
    "numerical frg calculations for the 2-dimensional hubbard model were started by zanchi and schulz @xcite some years ago .",
    "they examined the simplest tight binding model with only nn hopping in the kinetic energy .",
    "this choice introduces special features such as a perfectly nesting form of the half - filled fermi surface , which also contains two divergent van hove singularities .",
    "later honerkamp , salmhofer and collaborators @xcite extended the calculations to include a nnn hopping term in the kinetic energy .",
    "this is necessary to reproduce the observed cuprate fermi surface .",
    "it also removes perfect nesting and moves the van hove singularities away from half - filling .",
    "the kinetic energy includes nn and nnn hopping on a square lattice with matrix elements denoted as @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . in the hubbard model",
    "the interaction between electrons is reduced to an onsite coulomb repulsion u , @xmath22    the frg method can be formulated in several ways . in the wilsonian form , successive energy shells are integrated out to arrive at the low energy effective hamiltonian . in this form",
    "the energy cutoff , @xmath23 is the flow parameter in the rg equations that determines the effective interaction vertex @xmath24 .",
    "this vertex is a function of 3 wave vectors ( the fourth is determined by momentum conservation including umklapp processes ) leading to a functional rg flow . to handle this flow numerically , zanchi and",
    "schulz @xcite divided the brillouin zone into discrete patches , assuming a constant value in each patch set .",
    "later honerkamp and salmhofer @xcite developed an alternative formulation using the temperature as the rg flow parameter .",
    "this @xmath11-flow method has the advantage that it includes possible small - q instabilities , e.g. , pomeranchuk and stoner instabilities , which are absent in the wilsonian formulation .",
    "however in the parameter range of interest here , such instabilities are never the dominant ones @xcite .",
    "below we summarize the main results of the wilsonian frg calculations @xcite and refer the reader to the original papers for more details .    in a band structure with @xmath25 ,",
    "typical for cuprates @xcite , the rg flows for the vertex @xmath24 depend strongly on the hole density .",
    "even with only a moderately strong value of the interaction , @xmath26 ( approximately half the bandwidth ) three regions with qualitatively different behavior are apparent in fig.[fig : rg - phase ] . in the strongly overdoped region with @xmath27 ( corresponding to @xmath28 in fig.[fig : rg - phase ] ) , the snapshot of the wave vector dependence of the vertex in fig.[fig : rg - carsten ] shows a clean _",
    "d_-wave pairing form .",
    "the energy scale in the vertex is chosen at the value when the strongest components equal to the bandwidth .",
    "note at this density the fermi surface touches the antinodal brillouin zone but this special choice has only a small influence .",
    "the largest components of @xmath24 are those with a zero momentum incoming pair , i.e. cooper pair scattering with a @xmath29 form factor . in this case",
    "the divergence appears in a single channel indicating a transition to _ d_-wave superconductivity .    for a very small doping , @xmath30 ( corresponding to @xmath31 in fig.[fig : rg - phase ] ) ,",
    "a single channel dominates the pattern at the cutoff scale @xmath23 when the strongest components reach a value of order of the bandwidth .",
    "the energy of the cutoff is now much larger and the snapshot of the vertex in fig.[fig : rg - carsten ] is quite different .",
    "the leading interactions are umklapp scatterings involving the patches where fermi surface intersects what would be the reduced antiferromagnetic brillouin zone , indicating a transition to af order .    in the intermediate density range ( intermediate values of @xmath32 in fig.[fig : rg - phase ] ) there is a continuous rise in the critical energy scale between over- and underdoping and a more complex pattern appears in the corresponding snapshot ( see fig.[fig : rg - carsten ] ) .",
    "it signals a continuous crossover between the two instabilities , _ d_-wave pairing and af .",
    "this comes about because there is mutual reinforcement , not simple competition , between the umklapp and pairing scattering processes .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the strong coupling state that should follow from these leading interactions - a point we will return to later .",
    "one result is clear , the overdoped region is characterized by the growth of a highly structured pattern in the leading components of the interaction vertex @xmath24 at low energy or temperature .",
    "it is not simply a _",
    "d_-wave cooper pair pattern but it contains also umklapp scattering processes which strengthen as the hole density is reduced .",
    "recently nigel hussey and collaborators @xcite performed an interesting series of transport measurements in the overdoped region of the phase diagram , which have shed new light on how the standard landau behavior breaks down .",
    "they found a striking correlation between charge transport and superconductivity in heavily overdoped high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "the onset of superconductivity as the doping , @xmath19 , is reduced coincides with the appearance in the normal phase of strong and highly anisotropic quasiparticle scattering processes .",
    "the application of a magnetic field , which suppresses superconductivity , revealed that the anisotropic term in the in - plane transport scattering rate was linear in temperature , violating the perturbative quadratic dependence characteristic of a landau fermi liquid .",
    "the experiments by hussey and collaborators @xcite were carried out on well characterized tetragonal single layer tl@xmath5ba@xmath5cuo@xmath33 samples .",
    "they measured the angle - dependent magnetoresistance oscillations and analyzed their results using a boltzmann equation to describe transport in a quasi-2d metal with a fourfold anisotropic scattering rate .",
    "this analysis also provided detailed fermi surface information .",
    "subsequent quantum oscillation experiments by vignolle _ et al_. @xcite and arpes experiments by plate et al @xcite , confirmed that the form of fermi surface in an overdoped tl@xmath5ba@xmath5cuo@xmath33 sample with doping @xmath34 agrees well with lda band structure calculations shown in fig.[fig : resistivity - om](a3 ) .",
    "the anisotropic term in the quasiparticle scattering rate grew as the doping , @xmath19 is reduced , proportional to the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath1 ( in zero field ) .",
    "the scattering rate varies strongly around the fermi surface and is maximal in the antinodal directions and vanishing along the nodal directions [ see fig.[fig : resistivity - om](a2 ) ] .",
    "note this anomalous behavior is not associated with a 2-dimensional van hove singularity at the fermi energy , as the measured fermi surface shows it lies clearly below the fermi energy in these tl- cuprates .",
    "instead this anomalous behavior points to a strongly anisotropic scattering vertex at low energies , which grows in strength as the doping @xmath19 is reduced .    as we discussed above , earlier frg investigations of a 2-dimensional hubbard model on a square lattice found that in the overdoped region of the phase diagram the structureless high energy scattering vertex evolved into a strongly anisotropic scattering vertex in the particle - particle and particle - hole channels at low energies and temperatures @xcite .",
    "further investigations revealed that the resulting self - energy is also very anisotropic @xcite .",
    "this work stimulated ossadnik and coworkers @xcite to undertake an extensive frg study of the doping and temperature dependence of the quasiparticle scattering rate under conditions such that the pairing instability suppressed .",
    "they chose a band structure in accord with the experimental fermi surface [ see fig.[fig : rg - om](a1 ) ] and a moderate value of the onsite coulomb repulsion since the 1-loop approximation in the frg calculations limits their reliability to at most moderately strong interactions .",
    "the frg calculations for these doping values ( @xmath35 ) and interaction strength , show a divergent flow at finite scales in the _ d_-wave pairing channel , indicating a finite @xmath1 for _ d_-wave superconductivity . in the experiments @xcite the pairing instability towards _",
    "d_-wave superconductivity is suppressed by a strong external magnetic field .",
    "it is not feasible to include a strong magnetic field in the frg calculations .",
    "instead a suppression of _ d_-wave cooper pairing was achieved by adding in an elastic scattering term in the flow of the 4-point scattering vertices . ossadnik _",
    "et al _ @xcite found a rising highly structured scattering vertex that gives an anisotropic contribution to the decay rate with an approximately linear , not quadratic , temperature dependence , when the pairing divergence is suppressed .",
    "it is worth repeating that this breakdown of standard landau fermi liquid behavior is not associated with a divergent density of states from a van hove singularity at the fermi energy but instead is due to strong scattering processes at large momentum transfer connecting the antinodal regions in @xmath13-space .",
    "these processes appear in the frg flows as a precursor to the mott insulating behavior at @xmath36 , i.e at half - filling .",
    "the main results of the frg calculations are illustrated in fig.[fig : rg - om ] .",
    "a comparison to the experimental results in fig.[fig : resistivity - om ] shows good qualitative agreement .",
    "the limitations on the interaction strength in the 1-loop frg calculations rule out a quantitative comparison but the good qualitative agreement is encouraging and gives us confidence that the frg calculations capture the main features of the evolution of the 4-point scattering vertex with hole density in the overdoped range .",
    "alternative proposals to explain the anomalous quasiparticle decay rate are discussed in the recent review by hussey _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "here we comment on only those put forward by alexandrov @xcite and wilson @xcite and by dell anna and metzner @xcite .",
    "the former two postulate the presence of two types of charge carriers , bound electron pairs forming charge 2e bosons and conduction electrons .",
    "the charged bosons act as strong scattering sites for the lighter conduction electrons causing the anomalous scattering rate .",
    "however it is unclear how to reconcile this proposal with the observed fermi surface , which agrees with the ` a priori ' lda band structure calculations and includes all conduction electrons .",
    "the latter proposal postulates the presence of strong nematic fluctuations possibly due to a proximity to a pomeranchuk instability @xcite . scattering off these nematic fluctuations gives a power law exponent 4/3 , close to linear , in the scattering rate .",
    "note however that the presence of strong nematic fluctuations is rather questionable since the 2-dimensional van hove singularities lie clearly below the fermi energy in the overdoped ( @xmath34 ) sample studied by vignolle _",
    "et al _ @xcite and it moves lower as @xmath19 is reduced .",
    "this behavior is difficult to reconcile with a pomeranchuk instability driven by the proximity of 2-dimensional van hove singularities to the fermi energy across the extended range of hole densities .",
    "also the tl- and the closely related hg - cuprates do not undergo a crystallographic phase transition but retain their tetragonal crystal structure across the full doping range , from overdoped to underdoped @xcite .",
    "nonetheless a search for nematic fluctuations by neutron scattering investigations of the spin fluctuation spectrum in these tetragonal cuprates would be worthwhile .",
    "early nmr and specific heat experiments found that radical changes appear in the electronic properties as the hole density is reduced beyond a critical value .",
    "the experimental properties of underdoped cuprates have been comprehensively reviewed by timusk and statt @xcite .",
    "we will summarize some key results below .",
    "for now we briefly review the very recent experiments by hussey and collaborators extending their transport measurements to lower densities @xcite .",
    "the high values of @xmath1 in single layer tl- and hg - cuprates make them unsuitable for experiments on the normal state at low @xmath11 near optimal doping .",
    "this would require magnetic field strengths beyond those currently available to suppress superconductivity .",
    "hussey and coworkers @xcite extended their transport measurements to the lsco ( la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 ) cuprates which have lower @xmath1 values and can therefore be studied in the normal state in laboratory magnetic fields over a wide range of @xmath19-values .",
    "however detailed angular dependent magneto - resistannce experiments were not possible .",
    "instead the planar resistivity , @xmath37 , was measured and analyzed in the temperature range @xmath38 in terms of linear and quadratic @xmath11-terms , i.e. the resistivity is represented as @xmath39 .",
    "their results for the anomalous linear term , @xmath40 , show a similar behaviour to the anisotropic linear-@xmath11 term reported earlier in the tl - cuprates , namely a rising value as @xmath19 is decreased in the overdoped regime in samples with finite @xmath1 values , see fig.[fig : anistropy - scatter ] .",
    "interestingly this rise does not continue indefinitely but has a maximum at a critical hole density , @xmath41 .",
    "this density marks the transition between the overdoped and underdoped regions of the phase diagram , indicating the presence of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) at @xmath42 . as cooper _",
    "et al _ @xcite note , this behaviour with @xmath40 , the linear-@xmath11 coefficient of the resistivity , finite over a broad density range around @xmath43 differs distinctly from the funnel shape region centered on the qcp seen in other metals where the qcp is caused by a symmetry change . in this latter case",
    "the linear-@xmath11 behavior is generally interpreted as a consequence of scale invariant physics near to the qcp .",
    "et al _ @xcite propose that in the cuprates the qcp at @xmath42 , signals the destruction of the quasiparticles by the increasing interaction strength as @xmath19 passes through @xmath43 .",
    "the angular dependence of the quasiparticle scattering rate can not be determined from the lsco experiments .",
    "however we know from the experiments on the tl - cuprates that the anisotropic interactions couple predominantly the quasiparticles near the antinodal points .",
    "this suggests that the change in the quasiparticle spectrum sets in first in the vicinity of the antinodal points .",
    "the underdoped cuprates with @xmath44 show a host of anomalous properties in what is nowadays referred to as the pseudogap phase .",
    "timusk and statt @xcite published a very complete review of experiments in this phase a few years back . here to motivate the later analysis , we summarize some key results and refer the reader for more details to the timusk - statt review @xcite . a shorter review covering the main issues in the ongoing debate on the physics of the pseudogap appeared later @xcite .",
    "the anomalous features first appeared in an early comparison of the spin susceptibility , determined from the nmr knight shift , between underdoped and optimally doped yba@xmath5cu@xmath45o@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "samples with @xmath47 values around 0.3 , showed a very substantial drop in the spin susceptibility in the normal state at @xmath48t@xmath49 , which contrasted strongly with the constant value in the normal phase in optimally doped samples with @xmath50 .",
    "this drop is generally interpreted as a consequence of a gap , or partial gap , opening in the magnetic spectra as a result of singlet spin pairing .",

    "a series of arpes experiments in the normal phase at @xmath51 showed that full fermi surface observed in the overdoped region , was truncated to a set of four fermi arcs centered on the four nodal points @xmath52 @xcite . in the antinodal regions",
    "the arpes spectra in underdoped cuprates show a finite energy gap .",
    "the spectral weight at the fermi energy consists of a set of 4 arcs , disconnected from each other and ending on the square surface in @xmath13-space whose sides connect the antinodal points . since the timusk - statt review @xcite , more detailed arpes experiments which will be described later , have examined these fermi arcs .",
    "a similar set of fermi arcs was deduced from the interference patterns in recent stm spectra at low voltages and low temperatures in the superconducting state of underdoped samples @xcite .",
    "these patterns , when interpreted as a consequence of weak disorder scattering , allow the determination of the energy spectra of the coherent bogoliubov quasiparticles in the superconducting state .",

    "et al _ @xcite to observe the fermi surface underlying these propagating bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
    "it also consists of arcs , similar to those observed directly in the arpes experiments .",
    "further evidence for a reconstruction of the fermi surface comes from recent quantum oscillation experiments on underdoped samples at high fields and low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the period of the oscillations requires small closed fermi pockets , quite different to the full lda fermi surface observed in overdoped samples .",
    "the relationship between these closed electron - like fermi pockets at high fields and low temperatures and the apparently open fermi arcs observed by arpes at zero fields and higher temperatures , remains to be clarified .",
    "but the pronounced change in the quantum oscillation periods and the sign change of the hall effect @xcite at high fields and low t , confirm that a drastic change has occurred in the normal phase as the doping @xmath19 is reduced through the qcp at @xmath42 .",
    "the observation of these apparently disconnected fermi arcs rather than connected closed fermi curves found in standard metals , has stimulated strong theoretical interest and various proposals have been put forward to explain it .",
    "one line of thought focuses on a fermi surface reconstruction due to the presence of some kind of superlattice order .",
    "this requires a breaking of translational symmetry .",
    "the simplest such symmetry breaking would be the presence of charge ( cdw ) or spin ( sdw ) wave order .",
    "such superlattice order does appear in some underdoped cuprates which show static stripes , e.g. la@xmath53ba@xmath54cuo@xmath17 which has been studied by neutron scattering @xcite and nmr / nqr experiments @xcite .",
    "however it is not a general feature of the underdoped cuprates as can be seen from nmr / nqr experiments .",
    "this experimental technique has the advantage that it can be widely applied and as a local measurement it can detect modulations in the local environment of specific nuclei . on the other hand the spin gap phenomenon is a general feature of underdoped cuprates and is clearly apparent in the nmr experiments on hg - cuprates @xcite and on yba@xmath5cu@xmath17o@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the latter is especially interesting as well ordered stoichiometric crystals of this compound can be grown .",
    "the hg - cuprates are the least disordered of the randomly acceptor doped cuprates @xcite . as a result",
    "these cuprates are good choices to test for the presence of intrinsic superlattice order .",
    "nmr / nqr experiments on all of these cuprates report negative results for cdw and sdw superlattice order @xcite , e.g. as shown in fig.[fig : nmr - pseudogap ] .",

    "vojta has recently published a comprehensive review on this subject @xcite .",
    "recent examples are the observation of the onset of a nematic distortion of the magnetic excitation spectrum at @xmath56 in strongly underdoped ybco by hinkov and collaborators @xcite and the short range nematicity observed in stm spatial images reported by lawler et al @xcite .",
    "the key issue in our view is whether these broken symmetries are the cause of the pseudogap phenomena or are instabilities of the pseudogap phase which show up at lower temperatures and doping , perhaps influenced by the strong local electric fields arising from the random acceptor ions .",
    "the absence of these broken symmetries in the cleanest and best ordered underdoped cuprates discussed above at small magnetic fields , leads us to espouse the latter point of view . in high magnetic fields anomalies in transport properties",

    "@xcite ) point towards some form of superlattice ordering when superconductivity is weakened by the magnetic field .",
    "we shall return to this issue towards the end in sect .",
    "6 when discussing the magnetic properties of the pseudogap phase .    in the absence of direct observations of broken translational symmetry in clean samples",
    ", there are suggestions that some form of hidden symmetry breaking could be causing the reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "one possibility put forward by chakravarty and coworkers @xcite is a so called _",
    "d_-density wave ( ddw ) state also known as a staggered flux phase due to the presence of staggered orbital currents around the cuo@xmath17 plaquetes .",
    "all cu- and o- sites are equivalent in a ddw ordered state so it is not clear if nmr is a definitive test .",
    "the doubling of the unit cell in a ddw state reconstructs the fermi surface into a set of elliptical pockets centered on the nodal points .",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that the spectral weight of quasiparticles is not uniform around the pockets and is reduced on the side furthest away from the zone centre .",
    "as a result the pockets could appear as disconnected fermi arcs in arpes experiments .",
    "for a recent review see chakravarty @xcite . while the nmr and arpes experiment do not obviously contradict the presence of ddw order , here are still some open questions .",
    "the staggered orbital currents in this phase give rise to a small af moment perpendicular to the cuo@xmath5 planes .",
    "neutron scattering experiments on yba@xmath5cu@xmath17o@xmath55 have not been possible due to the small size of the crystals but the ybco compound orthoii- yba@xmath5cu@xmath45o@xmath57 , which is underdoped with short range ordered alternating empty and filled cuo chains , can be made in large enough samples to allow neutron scattering experiments .",
    "these did not provide evidence for static af order @xcite .",
    "a further difficulty is the absence of signs of a phase transition in thermodynamic measurements , e.g. the knight shift measurements on yba@xmath5cu@xmath17o@xmath55 show a continuous onset of the spin gap unlike the behavior expected at a symmetry breaking phase transition leading to a strong fermi surface reconstruction @xcite .",
    "lastly , we should comment on recent neutron scattering experiments which find evidence that the onset of the pseudogap is accompanied by the appearance of spontaneous intra - unit - cell orbital currents as the temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "this shows up as an additional contribution , which flips the neutron spin , to the bragg peaks in neutron scattering .",
    "at present there are open questions in the interpretation of the origin of these orbital currents @xcite .",
    "their relevance to the spin gap and the fermi surface reconstruction is not immediately obvious .",
    "a small anomaly has been found in the uniform magnetic susceptibility at the onset temperature of the these orbital currents @xcite .",
    "very recently extra modes were reported in neutron scattering experiments on hg - cuprates and attributed to the orbital currents by li et al @xcite .",
    "the importance of these orbital currents remains under debate at present .",
    "a recent search by nmr for a weak magnetic field on the ba sites in yba@xmath5cu@xmath17o@xmath55 caused by the orbital currents proved negative @xcite . note , varma and collaborators @xcite argue that this broken symmetry order plays a key role in the physics of the pseudogap phase .",
    "we turn now to a brief review of the theoretical proposals to describe the anomalous arpes spectra of the pseudogap phase without invoking the presence of a broken symmetry order .",
    "the simplest possibility is to ascribe the whole phenomenon to a remnant _ d_-wave pairing energy gap in the presence of strong phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "such fluctuations are controlled by the superfluid stiffness , which in turn is controlled by the superfluid carrier density .",
    "early measurements by uemura showed this scales with the hole doping , @xmath19 , in the pseudogap region @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a hole doped mott insulator , not unexpected given the proximity to the mott insulator at stoichiometry .",
    "early on emery and kivelson @xcite argued for an extended temperature region of preformed pairs extending above a bkt transition temperature @xmath58 . in recent years experiments by ong and collaborators on the nernst effect @xcite and diamagnetic contributions to the magnetic susceptibility in the pseudogap region @xcite , have confirmed the existence of superconducting fluctuations above @xmath1 extending up to a temperature  2@xmath1 .",
    "this temperature however lies substantially below the onset temperature @xmath59 for the pseudogap and spin gap particularly at small @xmath19 where @xmath60 but @xmath61 const .",
    "recent experiments using a variety of experimental techniques have reached similar conclusions @xcite .",
    "this suggests that there is more to this behavior than simply a region of preformed pairs with strong phase fluctuations .",
    "the large value of the antinodal energy gap measured by arpes and stm at small @xmath19 , relative to @xmath62 , and its scaling with @xmath59 rather than @xmath1 have led many authors to a two - gap scenario ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this approach the mechanisms underlying the pseudogap and the superconducting order differ and are to be distinguished . an interesting ginzburg - landau formulation of the phase fluctuation scenario has recently been published by ramakrishnan and collaborators @xcite .",
    "we will return to this debate in more detail in the next chapter .",
    "the possibility of singlet spin pairing in the underdoped region was raised very early by anderson @xcite .",
    "he introduced the rvb concept which emphasizes the energetic stability of the spin singlet state of a pair of af coupled @xmath9 spins .",
    "he argued that a spin liquid state of singlet pairs stabilized by quantum mechanical fluctuations could become superconducting upon doping .",
    "while it is now clear that the planar af @xmath9 heisenberg model has a long range af ordered ground state , it is also clear that this state contains strong singlet pairing fluctuations and that the af order is rapidly destabilized by introducing hole doping .",
    "the rvb concept is very appealing physically but has proved very difficult to construct a full microscopic theoretical formulation .",
    "the difficulty lies in the inherent strong coupling fermionic nature of a hole doped af .",
    "much progress has been made over the years using gauge theory formulations coupled with slave boson mean field approximations .",
    "in addition a variety of numerical techniques , e.g. variational monte carlo ( vmc ) , exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite clusters , dynamic mean field theory ( dmft ) , have been employed to gain insight into this system of strongly interacting fermions .",
    "a series of recent reviews cover these topics @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will look further into the possibility of fermi surface reconstruction without translational symmetry breaking .",
    "this seems counterintuitive at first but there is a well known counterexample , namely 2-leg hubbard ladders @xcite , which we will argue in the next section , has strong similarities to the underdoped cuprates .",
    "the basic premise behind the yrz ansatz @xcite is that the crossover from the overdoped metallic state to the pseudogap phase signals the transition from a full fermi surface metal to a phase which behaves as a doped mott insulator .",
    "an important characteristic of the mott phase is that its insulating property is not the result of af long range order or other broken translational symmetry , but only of a strong onsite coulomb repulsion at a filling of exactly 1 el./site .",
    "it follows that precursors to the mott state need not be accompanied by broken translational symmetry either . in a mott insulator",
    "the fermi surface is completely suppressed and it is clearly interesting to examine the way in which the fermi surface evolves in the precursor state . in",
    "an early paper brinkman and rice @xcite analyzed the approach to the mott transition from the metallic side at a density of 1 el./site using the gutzwiller approximation to treat a projected fermi sea wavefunction .",
    "the volume enclosed by the fermi surface remains constant in their approach but the coherent quasiparticle weight is progressively reduced and the quasiparticle effective mass diverges as the onsite repulsion approaches the critical value . in this analysis the exchange spin - spin coupling is ignored .",
    "the divergence of the effective mass can be associated to a reduction of the effective fermi temperature  the temperature scale at which the entropy saturates at the spin only value , @xmath63/site .",
    "actually the brinkman - rice approach works well in the landau - fermi liquid state of @xmath64he and as vollhardt showed captures the essential characteristics of the approach to the solid crystalline state when an external pressure is applied @xcite .",
    "this is a special case since the exchange coupling between the spins vanishes due to the very strong short range repulsion between @xmath64he atoms .",
    "the cuprates are very different with a strong superexchange coupling between spins and also an underlying lattice which allows umklapp scattering events , unlike the @xmath64he liquid .",
    "the brinkman - rice approach does not work for them .",
    "this can be seen directly in arpes experiments which show a partially truncated fermi surface and an almost constant fermi velocity in the nodal direction in the underdoped pseudogap phase .",
    "a second scenario is an evolution of the fermi surface analogous to the behavior of cr alloys @xcite . in these alloys",
    "the fermi surface is progressively truncated by a series of incommensurate sdw phases as the el./atom ratio is changed and transition to a the commensurate af ordered phase with a much reduced fermi surface and a larger energy gap is stabilized .",
    "similar behavior can also be ruled out for the cuprates by the absence of long range sdw order in neutron scattering and nmr experiments associated with the pseudogap phase .",
    "the only exception is the so called stripe phase observed in cuprates with the low temperature tetragonal crystal structure around a hole doping on @xmath65 .",
    "but the recent experiments of li et al @xcite as interpreted by berg et al @xcite show more complex behavior with an array of interpenetrating sdw and anti - phase superconducting domain walls .    for an alternative approach",
    ", we look to systems where a repulsive interaction causes insulating behavior even at weak values and without breaking translation symmetry .",
    "thus the two requirements for a mott insulator are satisfied .",
    "the simplest such case is the 2-leg hubbard ladder at half - filling .",
    "this system has been extensively discussed in the literature ( for a review see ref@xcite ) .",
    "the ground state is nondegenerate and insulating for all @xmath66 with finite energy gaps in the spin , single particle and pair channels .",
    "further translational symmetry along the ladder is preserved .",
    "the pair gap , necessary for a charge gap and insulating behavior , is present only at half - filling .",
    "it is interesting to trace its origin in the frg analysis at weak coupling .",
    "it arises because of the presence of additional elastic umklapp scattering processes connecting the 4 fermi points exactly at half - filling e.g. the two right moving fermi vectors of the bonding and antibonding bands add up to @xmath67 and so such a pair can backscatter to the two left moving fermi vectors with an allowed crystal momentum transfer of @xmath68 .    while one may argue that this is a special feature of one dimension without an analog in higher dimensions , the evolution of wider ladders as the width increases , raises the possibility of analogous behavior in two dimensions .",
    "we shall summarize the key results here and refer to a recent review for more details @xcite . for n legs with nn hopping and open boundary conditions ,",
    "there are n bands corresponding to standing waves with transverse wavevectors @xmath69 with @xmath70 . at half - filling",
    "the bands can be grouped in pairs with equal and decreasing fermi velocities as follows @xmath71    the case of a 4-leg ladder is illustrated in fig.[fig:4legl ] which shows that the fermi velocities in band pair 1 and 4 are smaller than band pair 2 and 3 . in a weak coupling hubbard model",
    "the frg flow of the interactions inside the band pairs is similar to the flow of a 2-leg ladder .",
    "the scale of the divergences depends exponentially on the inverse fermi velocity of the band pair . as a result",
    "the band pairs have a range of charge gaps with maximum values for the pair with @xmath72 and minimum values at @xmath73 for even values of n. it follows that upon hole doping away from half - filling , the hole density will not be uniformly spread over all the bands .",
    "instead the holes will enter first the central band pair with the largest fermi velocity and smallest charge gap and then into the next band pair etc .",
    "the result will be a successive opening of the bands in pairs with increasing hole density , starting from the band pair , which is nearest to the nodal direction in a 2d representation of the ladder and ending with the band pair nearest the antinodal directions .",
    "for the case of odd n , the centre band , @xmath74 remains unpaired and its frg flow is that of a single chain luttinger liquid .",
    "this partial truncation of the fermi surface in a wider hubbard ladder lightly doped away from half - filling , contradicts oshikawa s non - perturbative derivation @xcite of a relation between the volume enclosed by a fermi surface in an interacting fermi liquid and the total electron density in any dimension .",
    "this derivation has been quoted @xcite in support of the proposal that the observation of only finite fermi arcs in the pseudogap normal state , is due to strong phase fluctuations of the cooper pairing amplitude which destroy long range coherence but not the larger energy gaps opening on the full fermi surface near antinodal .",
    "the key step in the derivation is to equate the total wavevector associated with a displacement of the fermi surface through @xmath75 and the wavevector obtained by applying a corresponding lieb - schultz - mattis transformation in a lattice containing @xmath76 sites .",
    "however , closer examination reveals that the presence of an underlying lattice allows for more flexibility .",
    "this can be seen directly by looking at the simple example of a lightly hole doped 3-leg hubbard ladder . in this case",
    "the bands 1 and 3 are even parity and @xmath77 is odd parity under reflection about the central leg .",
    "both rg calculations at weak coupling @xcite and exact diagonalizations at strong coupling @xcite , find the charge gap in the odd parity band is smaller than in the pair of even parity bands at half - filling . as a result all the holes enter the odd band initially up to a finite value of the hole density @xmath43 , which depends on the interaction strength , u. in this doping range the odd band behaves as a luttinger liquid with a spanning vector @xmath78 and only this odd band contributes to the total wavevector resulting from the displacement by @xmath75 .",
    "the even bands remain half - filled with a charge gap . the total electron density per unit ladder length corresponds to a total wavevector under a lieb - schultz - mattis transformation with a value @xmath79 .",
    "these two wavevectors differ by @xmath68 , i.e. a reciprocal lattice vector . in general , in a crystal two wavevectors can only be equated modulo a reciprocal lattice vector , as is the case here .",
    "this flexibility allows for the possibility of a partial truncation of a fermi surface in higher dimensions by a commensurate gap even in the absence of broken translational symmetry . in one dimension ,",
    "i.e. a single chain this flexibility is absent , because the relevant wavevectors are smaller than a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "this flexibility has been noted also by senthil and coworkers @xcite in their analysis of the fl*- model for heavy fermion metals with a small fermi surface containing only the conduction electrons . as will be discussed further in section 7 a fl*-model for underdoped cuprates has recently been proposed by sachdev and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the fl*-models contain gapless gauge modes which senthil et al @xcite argue can contribute to resolve the total wavevector discrepancy .",
    "another well - controlled model with a partially truncated fermi surface is a two dimensional array of weakly coupled 2-leg hubbard ladders oriented along the @xmath80-axis .",
    "konik , rice and tsvelik @xcite considered the case of long range inter - ladder hopping whose fourier transform is sharply peaked in @xmath81 .",
    "this choice allows them to treat the inter - ladder hopping by an rpa approach . at half - filling ,",
    "the individual ladders have a charge and spin gap and the single particle propagator @xmath82 [ @xmath83 , changes sign as @xmath84 passes through each fermi wavevector by passing through a zero rather than an infinity .",
    "note that the single ladder green s function in eq.[eq : twoladder ] derived by konik and ludwig in the weak coupling limit @xcite has the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the incoherent part , @xmath87 is the coherent weight , @xmath88 is the bare band dispersion , @xmath89 is the quasiparticle gap .",
    "the single ladder self energy at zero frequency diverges at the fermi wavevectors , @xmath90 , causing zeroes to appear in @xmath91 at these wavevectors .",
    "note that the self - energy in eq.[eq : twoladder ] is similar to the diagonal self - energy in a superconducting state and there is no off - diagonal component .",

    "increasing @xmath93 beyond a finite value causes poles to appear in the propagator leading to the appearance of a set of electron and hole pockets as illustrated in fig.[fig : ladder ] . at half - filling",
    "these electron and hole pockets have equal areas so that the luttinger sum rule is again obeyed . beyond a certain hole doping the electron pockets",
    "get emptied and we are left with a fermi surface consisting of a set of hole pockets . the luttinger sum rule continues to hold with sign changes at the fixed lines of zeroes as well as the hole pockets .",
    "note these lines of zeros are fixed in @xmath13-space independent of the hole doping and enclose an area of exactly 1 el./site in agreement with the arguments made above .",
    "@xmath97 remains unchanged upon hole doping close to half filling .",
    "the role of zeroes in green s function has been first discussed by dzyaloshinski @xcite some years ago .      motivated by the frg results which are valid up to a moderate strength of the onsite coupling u , and by the single particle propagator obtained for a two - dimensional array of weakly linked 2-leg ladders , we proceed to the yang - rice - zhang ansatz for the coherent part of the single particle green s function for the normal state in a doped mott insulator .",
    "the key postulate is that there is a continuous crossover from the weak to moderate interaction to the strong interaction limit .",
    "such a continuous crossover is common in one - dimensional systems , e.g. a two leg hubbard ladder . in this case",
    "at half - filling the system is always insulating and with strictly short ranged af order and the main difference between weak and strong coupling is in the separation of the energy of charge and spin excitations as the onsite repulsion is increased .",
    "this is the motivation behind the choice of the yrz ansatz .",
    "we consider a 2d @xmath10 model , which is in the strong coupling limit of the repulsive hubbard model , with @xmath20 the hopping integral , and @xmath98 the nearest neighbor spin - spin coupling .",

    "second , the initial slope at low t , @xmath223 , is relatively constant as the hole doping , @xmath19 , is reduced at @xmath43 .",
    "this is easily understood as the initial slopes are dominated by thermally excited quasiparticles which are concentrated near the nodal direction and this region of the fermi pockets is rather insensitive to @xmath19 . in fig.[fig : lambda0 ] the comparison with experiment is shown . in the main panel the value of @xmath217 is compared to the bscco data of anukool et al .",
    "@xcite with the doping scaled to @xmath43 the optimal concentration .",
    "the curve labelled `` yrz mod '' , sets @xmath224 outside the fermi pockets .",

    "the doping of each sample was determined from the value of @xmath1 by fitting a parabolic form for @xmath227 with a maximum at , @xmath225 .",
    "the overall agreement is satisfactory .",
    "however we should point out that there is a question regarding the neglect of vertex corrections in eq.[eq : penetration ] .",
    "in eliasberg theory the migdal theorem justifies this step .",
    "generally the quasiparticle weight factors are cancelled by the vertex corrections , which would affect the @xmath19-dependence of @xmath228 .",
    "also the fine details of the yrz ansatz are not tested .",
    "for example , the lower curve in fig.[fig : lambda0 ] labelled yrz mod , was calculated by carbotte et al @xcite using a modification of the yrz form which omitted the region of @xmath13-space outside the fs pockets and it does not differ so much from the full ansatz .",
    "but they find the fits to a nodal liquid are less good .",
    "so we can conclude that the yrz ansatz is generally consistent with the @xmath11 and @xmath19 dependence of the penetration depth in the pseudogap phase .",

    "however it would be premature to conclude that all details of the ansatz have been verified , e.g. the precise evolution of the fermi surface through the qcp separating the overdoped and underdoped regions of the phase diagram .",
    "a decade ago deutscher @xcite pointed out the contrast between the andreev tunneling in the overdoped and underdoped regions of the phase diagram .",
    "the andreev tunneling involves injecting a cooper pair into a superconductor at low voltages and occurs in transparent junctions with a normal metal . in a standard bcs _",
    "s_-wave superconductor the tunneling current is enhanced at voltages below the gap @xcite . in the opposite limit of a high tunneling barrier",
    "the andreev process is suppressed and the tunneling spectrum is dominated by single particle processes which give the giaever spectra proportional to the single particle dos of the superconductor . the cutoff of the low voltage andreev signal is equal to the gap in the giaever spectrum .",
    "deutscher noted that in the case of tunneling into cuprates with the barrier perpendicular to the antinodal direction , the andreev cutoff and the giaever gap coincide in overdoped samples .",
    "( this choice of tunneling orientation avoids the complication of andreev bound states which arise when regions of @xmath13-space with different signs of the pairing order parameter are sampled ; see kashiwaya and tanaka @xcite ) .",
    "but in underdoped samples deutscher pointed out that the andreev cutoff was at a lower voltage than the peak in the giaever spectrum and the discrepancy increased with decreasing doping . in a subsequent review @xcite",
    ", he concluded that this discrepancy tilted the balance against the preformed pair scenario as an explanation for the pseudogap in the normal phase of underdoped cuprates .",

    "the energy scales in the transparent limit and in the high barrier limit agree . in panel",
    "( b ) the dos is compared to stm results on overdoped bscco samples with the magnitude of the superconducting gap on the full fermi surface adjusted to agree with experiment . in the underdoped case shown in fig.[fig : ud ]",
    "there is a marked discrepancy between the energy scale of the cutoff of the andreev signal and the peak in the dos .",
    "the former is determined by the maximum value of the pairing gap on the fermi pockets while the latter is controlled by the antinodal rvb gap in the yrz propagator .",
    "note the single particle gap here has contributions from both the rvb and pairing gaps but the former dominates and acts to suppress andreev processes .",
    "such a suppression was discussed by deutscher in his review @xcite for the case of tunnelling into a semiconductor with an attractive interaction strong enough to create a weak pairing amplitude but not enough to close the charge gap .",
    "this discrepancy poses difficulties for the preformed pair scenario which assumes the antinodal pseudogap is a pairing gap which persists for @xmath51 in a normal state with strong phase fluctuations .",
    "however at low @xmath11 in the presence of superconducting order it is not clear why the andreev spectra at over- and underdoping should be so different . on the other hand",
    "it is straightforwardly explained in scenarios such as yrz which describe the antinodal pseudogap as a precursor to the mott insulating state at stoichiometry .",
    "finally we note that the theoretical and experimental dos in the high barrier limit at underdoping ( see in fig.[fig : ud ] ) show similar features but also significant differences .",
    "up till now we have introduced superconductivity into the phenomenological yrz ansatz by simply adding a _ d_-wave pairing term but without discussing its origin .",
    "the yrz ansatz was motivated by the earlier frg calculations on a moderately coupled 2-dimensional hubbard model and by the analysis by konik et al . of an array of 2-leg",
    "weakly coupled hubbard ladders near half - filling with a specially chosen inter - ladder hopping @xcite . in this section",
    "we will discuss the implications of the model for a microscopic description of the pairing and magnetic properties .",
    "recently schachinger and carbotte @xcite examined the effect of the pseudogap on the superconducting state when a pairing interaction mediated by af spin fluctuations with the form proposed by millis , monien and pines @xcite is introduced .",
    "they did a careful analysis of the resulting gap equation to determine the interplay between the two gaps  the rvb gap in the yrz propagator and the sc gap .",
    "they chose the coupling constants to give a parabolic form for @xmath249 , typical of many cuprate superconductors with a maximum in @xmath249 at @xmath43  the qcp density .",
    "several interesting conclusions were obtained .",
    "the momentum dependence of the sc gap showed substantial deviations from the simple _ d_-wave form at hole densities near optimal . at ud",
    "the behavior is sensitive to the choice of the magnetic coherence length @xmath250 , which determines the width of the af spin fluctuation peak .",
    "a short @xmath250 ( = 2.5a ) gives a simple _ d_-wave form for the sc gap but a longer value of @xmath250 ( = 10a ) ( i.e. sharply peaked af spin fluctuations ) gives rise to a marked change with a non - monotonic sc gap as @xmath13 approaches the antinodal direction .",
    "in general though , the presence of a strong rvb gap near antinodal does not act to suppress the sc gap much .",
    "another feature of their results is the increased strength of the overall coupling constant in the ud region that is necessary to reproduce the parabolic form for @xmath249 as a result of the smaller size of the fermi pockets .",
    "an enhanced value of the ratio @xmath251 follows at ud .      to begin the discussion of the consequences of opening up an energy gap in the antinodal region as the hole density moves through the qcp into the pseudogap phase , it is worthwhile to recall a simple model for the pseudogap phase put forward some years ago by nozieres and pistolesi @xcite .",
    "they considered a 2-dimensional semiconductor with a local attraction between the electrons and examined the direct transition between a semiconductor and a superconductor as the size of the semiconducting gap is reduced . in a mean field description",
    "the zero temperature bcs gap equation for this model reduces to the form @xmath252 \\label{eq : gap - np}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where v is the attraction , @xmath253 is the constant density of states per spin , @xmath196 the semiconducting gap and @xmath254 is the energy cutoff .",
    "the pairing gap @xmath186 is @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the gap in a metal ( @xmath257 ) with the same parameters .",
    "note in this model as illustrated in fig.[fig : sm - sc ] the single particle gap is always finite .",
    "the pairing gap is finite only for @xmath258 where the ground state is superconducting @xcite .",
    "as the qcp is approached from the superconducting side nozieres and pistolesi found that the phase stiffness @xmath259 , vanishes continuously as , @xmath260 . on the semiconducting side",
    "the pairing vertex takes the form @xmath261 + \\frac{\\mathbf{q}^{2}}{16\\pi } \\left [ \\frac{\\delta_{0}}{(\\omega/2)^{2 } - \\delta_{0}^{2 } }   \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by assuming that the semiconductor consists of a conduction and valence band with the dispersion @xmath262 .",
    "the pairing vertex @xmath263 has poles on the real axis when @xmath264 at an energy ( @xmath265 ) @xmath266 these poles describe a bound pair or cooperon excitation lying below the energy gap in the semiconducting phase .",
    "as the qcp is approached , the transition from the superconductor occurs through vanishing phase stiffness .",
    "the semiconductor on the other side of the qcp has a well - defined cooperon excitation which goes soft as the qcp is approached .",
    "the cuprates are clearly more complex than the nozieres - pistolesi model with a transition from a _",
    "d_-wave superconductor to an af mott insulator not at a fixed el / atom ratio but driven by doping .",
    "the semiconducting phase in the nozieres - pistolesi model is characterized by a soft cooperon excitation .",
    "recently konik , rice and tsvelik @xcite proposed an important role for a cooperon excitation in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates . as we noted above , the early frg studies on a 2-dimension hubbard model found that the crossover from overdoping to underdoping was characterized by the growth of a divergence in the af channel as the hole density decreases in addition to a diverging _",
    "d_-wave cooper channel present at overdoping .",
    "this combination of two diverging channels with similar critical energy scales in the frg flow raised the question as to the nature of the strong coupling phase that is stabilized at lower scales .",
    "if just a single channel diverges , the flow can be interpreted as a precursor to long range order in that channel .",
    "et al _ @xcite noted the similarity of this diverging flow in the af and _ d_-wave pairing channels to the flow in the half - filled 2-leg hubbard ladder where a similar multichannel flow pattern is seen . in this case",
    "the ground state is known from bosonization and it is an insulator with finite energy gaps in the single particle , charge and spin sectors .",
    "the response is enhanced in the af and `` _",
    "_ d__-wave '' pairing channels but the correlations in the ground state in these channels remain strictly short range .",
    "this led honerkamp and coworkers @xcite to conjecture that at the qcp marking the transition to underdoping , a gapped region with similar characteristics could appear near the antinodal points in the square lattice .    to test this conjecture exact diagonalizations of a reduced hamiltonian retaining only the leading interactions in the frg flow , were carried out by laeuchli and collaborators @xcite . to make the problem tractable the scattering processes , both normal and umklapp , were discretized to those connecting a finite grid of @xmath13-points chosen in the antinodal regions .",
    "the low energy excitation spectrum was found to exhibit energy gaps in the single particle , charge and spin sectors similar to the 2-leg ladder .",
    "further , the pattern of the enhanced response functions in the ground state was found to be the same as that of the half - filled 2-leg hubbard ladder . in short",
    "these calculations offer support to the conjecture of honerkamp and colleagues @xcite that a 2-dim .",
    "analog to the ladder forms initially in the antinodal region as a precursor to the mott insulting state at half - filling .",
    "laeuchli and collaborators @xcite further suggested that in this case although the antinodal gap is insulating , it will be connected to the remnant fermi surface in the nodal region through pair scattering processes in the cooper",
    "_ d_-wave channel .",
    "such processes can stabilize superconductivity primarily on the remnant fermi pockets because of the enhanced `` _",
    "_ d__-wave '' pairing response in the latter regions .",
    "recently konik , rice and tsvelik @xcite went further .",
    "they examined an array of coupled 4-leg hubbard ladders near half - filling .",
    "as discussed earlier in wider ladders the bands pair up on a hierarchy of energy scales with the pairing of the outermost and innermost bands having the largest gap etc @xcite . now this band pair exhibits enhanced responses similar to the half - filled 2-leg hubbard ladder .",
    "these are accompanied by the appearance of two collective excitations in the energy gap , a cooperon pair and a triplet magnon excitation .",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed that in the 4-leg ladder array inter - ladder hopping at low doping can lead to fermi pockets from the two central bands with the smaller energy gap , similar to the case of the array of 2-leg hubbard ladders these authors considered earlier @xcite .",
    "for a suitable parameter choice , the band pair with the larger energy gap remains half - filled and insulating for a finite density range but with a cooperon collective excitation . under these conditions ,",
    "a pairing attraction is generated on the fermi pockets with the central band pair through coupling in the cooper channel to the cooperon of the insulating band pair .",
    "although this is clearly an artificial model , konik _",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed it as a tractable model which contains the essential features of the cuprates , namely _",
    "d_-wave pairing on remnant fermi pockets generated by coupling to the cooperon excitation living on the remaining gapped bands .",
    "however in the antinodal region the yrz ansatz assumes that the single particle gap , which is due to _ d_-wave pairing in the overdoped region , transforms into an insulating gap at the qcp . in the underdoped region",
    "the analogy was drawn to the 2-leg hubbard ladder at half - filling , which shows a charge gap with a cooperon lying below the single particle gap .",
    "the simplest scenario then to connect the two doping regions , is to assume that the qcp is analogous to that in the nozieres - pistolesi qcp associated with the emergence of a finite energy cooperon . in the present case",
    "this could occur through the increasing strength of the umklapp scattering between the antinodal regions , rather than an increase in an underlying band gap . in this scenario",
    "the pseudogap phase is characterized by a reduced fermi pocket centred on the nodal directions coexisting with a finite energy cooperon excitation .",
    "note , such a cooperon can decay into 2-particle excitations of the fermi pockets leading to a cooperon resonance that appears as the pseudogap suppresses the low energy dos .",
    "the close similarity to the 4-leg hubbard ladder array analyzed by konik _",
    "is clear .",
    "so far the models and their interpretation have been restricted to weak to moderate coupling .",
    "but the mott insulating state at zero doping shows that the onsite coulomb repulsion is strong in underdoped cuprates .",
    "recently , konik _",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed that a cooperon exists also at strong onsite repulsion .",
    "they based their conclusion on the results of exact diagonalization studies of small clusters .",
    "the only limitation in these calculations is the finite cluster size which currently is limited to small clusters containing up to 32 sites and 1 , 2 and 4 holes .",
    "leung and his collaborators @xcite have reported a series of calculations for these clusters using the strong coupling @xmath10 model , which describes the hubbard model near half - filling and its extensions to include longer range hopping and interactions .",
    "the main conclusions of these cluster calculations are as follows .",
    "the allowed set of @xmath13-points in a 32-site cluster with periodic boundary conditions contain both the 4 nodal ( @xmath267 ) and 2 antinodal points ( @xmath67 , 0 ) and ( 0 , @xmath67 ) . a single hole enters at a nodal point . for two holes",
    "there are two different states that are possible ground states , depending on the parameter values .",
    "for the plain @xmath10 model with only nearest neighbor hopping , a two - hole bound pair state with @xmath29 symmetry is the ground state on the 32-site cluster for @xmath268 , ( see fig.[fig : ed_tj ] ) .",
    "the binding energy is quite small at j / t = 0.3 but grows with increasing j / t .",
    "an extrapolation from finite size clusters to the infinite lattice however suggests that the pair state is no longer the ground state at j / t = 0.3 , but an excited state with an energy of approximately @xmath269 @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of longer range interactions and hopping in the @xmath10 model increases the energy of the pair state further and confirms the conclusion that for parameter values relevant to cuprates the ground state of the cluster has two unbound holes in the nodal states @xcite .",
    "extending the calculations to the 32-site clusters with 4 holes , which corresponds to a doping of 1/8 , shows all 4 holes entering into nodal states with no signs of pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "in view of the prominent bound pair excited state for two holes , a low energy excited state with two of the holes in a bound state may also be expected here .",
    "however at present there is no information on this question to the best of our knowledge .",
    "leung and collaborators @xcite concluded from these calculations that at low densities holes entered the nodal regions , consistent with nodal fermi pockets . the low energy _",
    "d_-wave pair excited state is interpreted as a finite energy cooperon in the strong coupling @xmath10 model and its extensions .",
    "note , an earlier study of two holes on smaller clusters by poilblanc and collaborators @xcite concluded in favor of the interpretation of the two hole bound state as a quasiparticle with charge 2e and spin 0 , which would be an actual carrier of charge under an applied electric field .",
    "in other words they concluded that a cooperon is present in the strong coupling @xmath10 model at low doping .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the origin of the pairing in this cooperon state was published recently by maier et al @xcite .    in the calculations on 32-site clusters",
    "the doped holes enter into the nodal ( @xmath267 ) points but the coupling to the",
    "_ d_-wave cooperon cancels completely exactly at the nodal directions .",
    "if we consider what will happen if the cluster size is expanded keeping a small , but finite , hole density , then finite fermi pockets centered on , but extending away from , the nodal directions will appear .",
    "these will contain @xmath13-states which do couple to the _ d_-wave cooperon resonance .",
    "the coupling to the cooperon will be weak since the fermi surface of the pockets extends only a small distance away from the nodal directions , but it will lead to a finite , but small , _ d_-wave pairing order parameter .",
    "recent numerical calculations using a novel fidelity approach also found evidence for such a small but finite pairing order parameter at low doping @xcite .",
    "note also the hole density in the case of two holes in a 32-site cluster is very low so that the superconducting order we are postulating should coexist with long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "there is considerable evidence both numerical , in variational monte carlo calculations , and experimental , in favor of such coexistence , as discussed in the recent review by ogata and fukuyama @xcite .",
    "we conclude that there is strong evidence that the pairing mechanism through coupling to finite energy cooperon resonances applies also at strong onsite repulsion .",
    "phenomenological models based on coupled fermions and bosons similar to that derived here , have been proposed much earlier @xcite to describe the high temperature superconductors .",
    "the closest similarity are to the models proposed by geshkenbein , ioffe and larkin @xcite and by chubukov and tsvelik @xcite .",
    "both these phenomenological models examined fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions , coupled in the _ d_-wave channel to cooperons associated with the antinodal regions but were not elaborated to describe the full complexity of the cuprate phase diagram .",
    "we turn now to the interpretation of the magnetic excitation spectrum that is observed in the pseudogap phase .",
    "a series of neutron scattering experiments on several cuprates have found an unusual spectrum which in keeping with the enhanced af response is centred at the wavevector ( @xmath270 ) .",
    "it has been named as a hourglass spectrum consisting of two components : a triplet mode centred at ( @xmath271 ) which disperses upward symmetrically around ( @xmath270 ) , and legs which stretch down to zero energy at a ring of wavevectors displaced slightly away from the wavevector ( @xmath271 ) to an incommensurate value @xcite .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature on the interpretation of this unusual spectrum . however , we will not attempt a full review here of this literature , which is covered in the reviews by timusk and statt @xcite and by ogata and fukuyama @xcite . instead",
    ", we limit the discussion to the question of whether this hourglass spectrum observed at low temperatures , is compatible with our expectations based on the analogy we have been using between the pseudogap phase and the half - filled 2-leg hubbard ladder .",
    "a recent review by barzykin and pines discusses the magnetic properties at higher temperature @xcite .",
    "this analogy also covers enhanced af response functions centered on ( @xmath271 ) @xcite .",
    "this enhanced response in the half - filled 2-leg hubbard ladder is a consequence of a finite energy triplet magnon and so it is reasonable to assume that a similar excitation should exist in the pseudogap phase . in the overdoped and optimally doped region",
    "the triplet magnon at ( @xmath271 ) appears only in the superconducting state at temperatures @xmath272 . a theoretical description using a rpa works well , as discussed in the review by ogata and fukuyama @xcite .",
    "this description can also be extended into the underdoped region as a collective mode appearing inside the reduced particle - hole dos associated with the pseudogap .",
    "the transition to long range af order occurs as the energy of this triplet magnon collapses when the hole density is reduced .",
    "the rpa calculations also include the low energy excitation branch which arises from particle - hole transitions between opposite fermi arcs .",
    "this interpretation of the low energy part of the spectrum as particle - hole excitations is confirmed by the neutron scattering experiments performed on yba@xmath5cu@xmath45o@xmath57-orthoii samples .",
    "this cuprate is among the best ordered underdoped cuprates and has the advantage that large single crystals are available .",
    "the experiments of stock et al @xcite show a clear suppression of the low energy spectrum as @xmath11 drops below @xmath1 consistent with a suppression of the low energy particle - hole excitations as the superconducting gap opens up on the nodal fermi arcs see figs.[fig : stock1 ] and [ fig : stock2 ] .",
    "a sketch of the combined spectrum is shown in fig.[fig : neutron - scattering ] .",
    "while the general features of the interpretation of the magnetic excitation spectra in the pseudogap phase fits within the theoretical framework , there are a number of features which remain to be clarified .",
    "in particular , the origin of broken translational and rotational symmetries in some cuprates at low temperatures covered in vojta s recent review @xcite , is an important issue .",
    "a careful study showing anisotropic behavior in the low energy spectrum and a nematic transition has been reported recently by hinkov et al @xcite in underdoped yba@xmath5cu@xmath45o@xmath33 samples .",
    "bascones and rice @xcite a few years ago pointed out that the low energy branch is composed of quasiparticle excitations in the presence of a highly polarizable background coming from the triplet magnon centred at ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "they examined the incommensurability reported in yba@xmath5cu@xmath45o@xmath57 orthoii samples but with limited success .",
    "this question of the stability and incommensurability of the low lying particle - hole excitation branch in the presence of a highly polarizable background requires theoretical study .",
    "another area with open questions is the role of impurities and disorder .",
    "a comprehensive review of this topic was recently published by alloul and coworkers @xcite and we will limit the discussion here to some points relevant to this review .",
    "the variational monte carlo results reviewed by ogata and fukuyama @xcite on gutzwiller projected wavefunctions with coexisting _ d_-wave pairing and long range af order show a wide range of coexistence of both orders up to hole concentrations of @xmath273 . also kitaoka and collaborators @xcite",
    "have interpreted their nmr experiments on multilayer hg - cuprates as evidence for a similar wide coexistence region in the phase diagrams . while the inner layers in these multilayer cuprates are very clean , surely the cleanest of all strongly underdoped cuprates , it is not obvious whether it is the perfection of these layers or other effects , e.g. the combination of interlayer superexchange and a reduced hole density in the inner layers , that is playing the decisive role in stabilizing the af long range order .",
    "the comparison to the cases of low doping in single layer la@xmath5cuo@xmath17 and bilayer yba@xmath5cu@xmath45o@xmath274 suggests that a region of incommensurate af order occurs in a single layer .",
    "sushkov @xcite has shown how such incommensurate af order arises as carriers are introduced into a 2-dimensional af ordered ground state , explaining the difference in the incommensurate order in a single layer with substantial disorder ( la@xmath5cuo@xmath17 ) and a bilayer with interlayer superexchange and weak disorder ( yba@xmath5cu@xmath45o@xmath274 ) .",
    "one interesting form of disorder which has a strong effect is zn substitution for cu in the cuo@xmath5 planes . in the undoped limit zn substitution",
    "simply removes sites in the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "there is only a weak effect on long range af order which is suppressed only when the zn concentration reaches the percolation value .",
    "the situation changes completely when holes are introduced . in the underdoped region",
    "both nmr and neutron scattering experiments show additional very low energy magnetic fluctuations consistent with introduction of local moments although zn@xmath3 is a closed shell ion @xcite .",
    "this behavior is similar to the effects of zn doping in srcu@xmath5o@xmath45  a 2-leg ladder cuprate @xcite . in this case",
    "each zn impurity adds a @xmath275 moment and these zn - induced moments show af order already at very low zn concentrations .",
    "this is easily understood intuitively for the 2-leg ladder as the breaking of a singlet bond on a rung leading to a free cu@xmath3 moment .",
    "the observation of similar behavior in underdoped cuprates supports the close analogy between the pseudogap phase and the 2-leg ladders .",
    "a series of ` a priori ' numerical calculations reproduced the local moment character of zn impurities in underdoped cuprates and interpreted their results in a similar manner @xcite .",
    "in this section we comment briefly on the relation of the yrz ansatz to other approaches to describe the anomalous properties of the pseudogap phase .",
    "a clear distinction is the starting point .",
    "most theories start from the undoped mott insulating state and consider the consequences of introducing holes into a state where a strong onsite coulomb repulsion has localized an electron on each site .",
    "such a strong onsite repulsion is difficult to handle directly .",
    "the introduction of holes into the undoped mott insulator is an essential perturbation which changes the low energy degrees of freedom from purely spin degrees of freedom to include fermionic degrees as well .",
    "the most popular approach to this problem has been to introduce a gauge field into the hamiltonian to enforce the constraint of no double occupancy .",
    "several reviews on these approaches have appeared recently where more details can be found @xcite .",
    "a factorization of fermions into spinons and holons is introduced with a local gauge condition on the spinon and holon operators which acts to enforce the onsite constraint . typically in the subsequent analysis ,",
    "it is too difficult to satisfy the gauge condition locally , and the condition is satisfied only on the average .",
    "this factorization leads to an expansion the hilbert space with extra degrees of freedom .",
    "the analysis that gives results closest to the yrz approach is the local su(2 ) gauge theory introduced by wen and lee @xcite , later extended by ng @xcite .",
    "a key element is the postulate of an attraction between spinons and holons leading to a fermionic bound state of a holon and spinon which then carries both spin and charge .",
    "this leads to a single electron propagator that , as discussed earlier , has a form with close similarities to the yrz form .",
    "recently patrick lee @xcite pointed out to us that actually the hopping term , which in a spinon - holon representation is a product of spinon and holon hopping operators , acts as a strong attraction between spinons and holons .",
    "further , a simple derivation of the yrz form for the propagator of a spinon - holon bound state , follows if one takes the spinon propagator that follows from rvb at half - filling , e.g. as in zhang et al @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a spinon - holon bound state is at variance with the assumption of spin - charge separation with separate spinons and holons interacting through transverse fluctuations of the gauge field .",
    "the existence of a bound state has the advantage that it cures the excess entropy problem associated with separate spinon and holon and transverse gauge field degrees of freedom .",
    "hlubina et al .",
    "@xcite some years ago compared the entropy under the latter approximation to the entropy of the t - j model including the onsite constraint , calculated in a high temperature expansion .",
    "a substantial excess over the high temperature expansion entropy results , even at moderate temperatures .",
    "they found that including the longitudinal gauge field gave rise to strong spinon - holon interactions which reduce the discrepancy .",
    "the presence of spinon - holon binding is a simple way to resolve the excess entropy difficulty .",
    "a derivation of the yrz form starting from the strong coupling t - j model complements the approach from weak coupling and the breakdown of landau fermi liquid theory presented here .",
    "further the yrz ansatz in this case offers a continuous connection between the weakly doped mott insulator at strong underdoping and the landau fermi liquid at strong overdoping .",
    "continuous crossovers between strong and weak coupling are a feature of one dimensional systems e.g. hubbard chains and ladders .",
    "as we have stressed earlier the yrz ansatz was motivated by analogies to hubbard ladders . in this sense",
    "it may be viewed as a generalization of ladder physics to two dimensions .",
    "an important feature of the hubbard 2-leg ladder is that strong qualitative changes in the low energy properties are brought about by short range , not long range correlations .",
    "this points out the need for theoretical methods to handle such qualitative changes in physical properties due to short range correlations .",
    "we believe this is a key challenge for the future .",
    "an alternative approach to the gauge theories for the strong coupling @xmath10 model has been pursued in recent years by anderson and his collaborators and is reviewed in a very recent paper @xcite . in this approach the crossover between the overdoped and underdoped regions is attributed to a crossover from a ground state dominated by the kinetic energy of the holes , i.e. the t - term , at overdoping , to one dominated by interactions i.e. the j - term , at underdoping . in the overdoping region",
    "the ground state can be written as a gutzwiller projected fermi sea with a full fermi surface .",
    "the effect of the constraint on double occupancy imposed by the gutzwiller projector is to enhance the low energy scattering vertex leading to strong inelastic damping of quasiparticles .",
    "the frg calculations discussed in sect .",
    "2 show similar behavior appearing at weak to moderate coupling and it is certainly reasonable to expect the such effects are enhanced as the coupling strength increases .",
    "the interaction dominated underdoped region is more difficult to analyze .",
    "anderson @xcite argues that the nodal - antinodal dichotomy arises from a difference in the effective gutzwiller projector which acts as a strong constraint in the antinodal region but only as a weak constraint near the nodes .",
    "the detailed form of the angular dependence is left open but it leads to a truncation of the fermi surface qualitatively similar to the yrz ansatz .",
    "the holes are concentrated in the nodal region while in the antinodal region the interactions dominate , leading to a self energy induced gap , similar to that in the rmft of zhang et al @xcite for an undoped rvb state .",
    "hopefully these various approaches built on phenomenological inputs , which give properties in line with the wide range of experiments on the pseudogap phase available today , will guide the way to a fully microscopic solution to this very challenging many body problem .",
    "another strong coupling approach is based on the fl@xmath276  a concept introduced in the analysis of the kondo lattice model for heavy fermions . in that model",
    "the fl@xmath276 state is a state with a small fermi surface of conduction electrons moving in a background of localized electrons which under appropriate conditions , do not order magnetically due to strong fluctuations .",
    "sachdev and collaborators @xcite have recently applied a similar approach to model the lightly doped mott insulator in underdoped cuprates as a fermi sea of holes moving in a background with local af order .",
    "long range af order is suppressed by strong fluctuations in the direction of the af moment but not in its magnitude . in the normal state",
    "the hole quasiparticles are coupled to fractionalized excitations of the fluctuating af background to form a fractionalized fl@xmath276 state .",
    "fermi pockets form which are centered on the nodal directions while the spectrum near antinodal remains gapped .",
    "this leads to a nodal - antinodal dichotomy  the central feature of the pseudogap phase .",
    "note , the fl@xmath276 pockets are not identical to the yrz pockets e.g. the anomalous self - energy remains finite at the back end of the pockets in the nodal directions and as a result the back end of the pockets does not touch the umklapp surface there , as they do in the yrz ansatz .",
    "this difference , however may not be easy to detect experimentally .",
    "a bigger difference would seem to be in the magnetic properties .",
    "the fl@xmath276 state , at least in its simplest version , has a spin gap with fractional spin excitations above it , which would seem to differ from the hourglass spectrum discussed in sect .",
    "in addition there are gapless collective nonmagnetic excitations . at present , such excitations , which should contribute to the specific heat , have not been reported in experiments .",
    "numerical calculations on the planar hubbard model using cellular and cluster dmft ( dynamic mean field theory ) schemes which give mott metal insulator transitions , have been making progress on improving the @xmath13- space resolution @xcite .",
    "a recent series of calculations have found a nodal - antinodal dichotomy with single particle energy gaps in the antinodal but not in the nodal @xmath13space regions , at small hole dopings into a mott insulating state .",
    "this dichotomy has been described as a @xmath13space selective mott transition in analogy to the orbitally selective mott transition proposed for certain transition metal compounds @xcite . at present",
    "the detailed @xmath13space behavior is not available in most calculations so that one can only say that the numerical results are consistent with the central characteristics of the yrz ansatz .",
    "the calculations by sakai et al @xcite obtain a specific form for the green s function with fermi nodal pockets and luttinger zeroes but these do not lie on the umklapp surface .",
    "in this article we have concentrated on our recent theoretical ansatz to describe the so - called pseudogap phase in underdoped cuprates .",
    "the theory is motivated by examining the functional renormalization group flows of the scattering vertex in the fermi liquid in the optimally to overdoped density range . at these densities",
    "both arpes and quantum oscillation experiments , show that the full fermi surface is maintained .",
    "but the low energy scattering vertex develops strong structure in @xmath13space .",
    "the strongest scatterings as discussed above , are those connecting the antinodal regions in @xmath13space .",
    "this @xmath13space structure shows up in angular dependent magnetoresistance experiments which measure the anisotropic scattering rates for quasiparticles in the normal state .",
    "the leading instability in this density region is towards _",
    "d_-wave pairing .",
    "however the growing strength of umklapp scattering processes as the hole density is reduced leads eventually to a breakdown of the full fermi surface .",
    "the ansatz for the single particle propagator was proposed to describe this breakdown .",
    "the key ingredient is a self - energy whose form is chosen by analogy with the form in half - filled 2-leg hubbard ladders where similar umklapp processes cause a charge gap , even at weak coupling .",
    "the close similarity between the frg flows in the simplified 2-patch model where 2-dimensional fermi surface is reduced to the two antinodal points , and the hubbard ladder is the main motivation behind this choice .",
    "in addition it was shown that in a 2-leg ladder array , the anomalous self - energy remains and leads to fermi pockets . in the cuprates",
    "the onsite repulsion is strong , not weak as in the cases discussed above .",
    "the ansatz incorporates the strong coupling effects through gutzwiller renormalization factors introduced by zhang et al .",
    "@xcite earlier , to describe the strong coupling effects within a mean field approximation treatment of the strong coupling @xmath10 model .",
    "note this renormalized mean field theory yielded a similar self energy to that used in the ansatz .",
    "the effectiveness of any phenomenological ansatz is measured by its success , or failure , to describe a wide range of experiments . in the present case",
    "there is a large body of experiments which determine the many anomalous properties of the pseudogap phase .",
    "the challenge to theory is to develop a consistent description covering this wide range .",
    "the account given above shows that the ansatz has had considerable success in describing these anomalies , both in a wide range of direct spectroscopic experiments and also in thermodynamic and other properties .",
    "our ansatz has of course its limitations .",
    "it aims to describe the pseudogap state as an unstable fixed point , different from but analogous to the fermi liquid unstable fixed that describes the normal phase of standard metals .",
    "the key role of such unstable fixed points in condensed matter physics was emphasized some years ago by p.w .",
    "anderson @xcite .",
    "the fixed points are called unstable because at the lowest temperature scales , broken symmetry instabilities generally appear .",
    "we have not attempted to address possible instabilities here , apart from some discussion on the _ d_-wave pairing instability towards superconductivity .",
    "experiments have shown that other instabilities appearing at temperatures below the onset temperature @xmath59 , in high magnetic fields but also in zero fields in some cases as well .",
    "in addition there are recent reports of broken time reversal symmetry setting in at or near @xmath59 whose origin may well require going beyond the single band description .",
    "these are some of the open issues that remain in the challenge that the spectacular properties of the high @xmath1 cuprates pose to condensed matter theory .",
    "we are grateful to our many collaborators on the physics of cuprates over the past quarter century .",
    "in particular the work discussed has benefited from our discussions with elena bascones , jules carbotte , weiqiang chen , yan chen , carsten honerkamp , robert konik , andreas laeuchli , urs ledermann , patrick lee , karyn le hur , elisabeth nicol , tai kai ng , matthias ossadnik , manfred salmhofer , manfred sigrist , alexei tsvelik and qiang - hua wang .",
