    "as a result of the first cycle of an iterative solution of the hedin equations,@xcite the commonly used @xmath1 approximation ( gwa ) models the electron self - energy as the product @xmath2 of a noninteracting green function @xmath3 and a dynamically screened coulomb interaction @xmath4 obtained within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the gwa that describes the long - range screening well has been successfully applied to a broad spectrum of materials where the interaction is not too strong and screening effects dominate .",
    "however , the gwa encounters difficulties ( first of all in its description of the satellite structure ) in the case of systems with localized states where short - range interaction prevails.@xcite for such systems , one has to use a theory beyond the gwa .",
    "this theory can be based on both an improvement of the rpa to get a more realistic screening picture and an inclusion into calculations of the electron self - energy of the higher - order terms in the screened interaction .    the first attempt to improve the rpa by including the effects of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) hole is well known to have been undertaken by hubbard,@xcite who introduced the so - called local - field factor .",
    "the concept of the latter is that all corrections to the rpa can be formally reduced to it .",
    "however , the hubbard local - field factor @xmath5 includes the frequency - independent exchange hole correction only .",
    "diagrammatically such @xmath5 can be exactly derived by summing the ladder diagrams for irreducible polarizability with a _ contact _ interaction and noninteracting green functions ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in order to explicitly include into consideration the full static xc hole around the screening electron , singwi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have obtained more sophisticated expression for @xmath5 which contains the equilibrium static pair - correlation function.@xcite further essential improvements in the derivation of the local - field factor have recently been done by different authors ( see , e.g. , refs . ) who have studied the frequency dependence of the xc hole .",
    "the concept of the local - field factor has taken on a new physical meaning in time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft).@xcite in the tddft within linear response theory , the dynamical factor @xmath6 is linked to the xc kernel @xmath7 .",
    "the latter plays the role of the time - dependent ( td ) xc interaction in addition to the coulomb repulsion @xmath8 . as a result",
    ", the response function @xmath9 can be written as @xcite @xmath10 where the irreducible polarizability @xmath11 is defined by the equation @xmath12 here and in the following we use the four - momentum variable @xmath13 as a shorthand for @xmath14 . in eq .",

    "approximation@xcite within a variational approach .",
    "they have summed an infinite number of self - energy , exchange , and fluctuation terms in the diagrammatic expansion of @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast to the hubbard @xmath5 , the local - field factor derived by this summation is a dynamical one .    the representation ( [ vertex_kernel ] ) of the vertex function allows one to include vertex corrections into the calculation of the electron self - energy ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "thus , the concept of the local - field factor suggested by hubbard considerably simplifies a problem of vertex corrections calculations in numerical applications and transfers all weight of the problem to calculations of the local - field factor ( or xc kernel ) for real systems .",
    "fundamentally distinct way to go beyond the gwa is based on the use of the @xmath0 matrix.@xcite the @xmath0-matrix approximation ( tma ) originally was established to study strongly correlated fermion systems with short - range interaction and is strictly valid in the limit of an almost filled or , because of particle - hole symmetry , an almost empty band.@xcite this approximation allows one to include processes involving multiple scattering between two electrons or two holes .",
    "this fact makes the tma capable of describing a satellite structure , for example , in ni.@xcite however , these calculations were performed using either a statically screened model interaction @xcite or the hubbard parameter @xmath23 within hubbard models.@xcite in the latter , the @xmath0 matrix in momentum space depends only on _ one _ four - momentum [ as well as the vertex function ( [ vertex_kernel ] ) expressed in terms of the local - field factor ] and schematically can be represented as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fourier transform of the product of two green functions .",

    "this factor and the exchange part of the local - field factor of ref .",

    "at @xmath75 , the factor ( [ lffanddrf ] ) is akin to the static local - field factor which has been calculated and parametrized in ref .  .",
    "thus , in the @xmath35 case , we have the transparent connection between the obtained local interaction and the exchange part of the local - field factor arising from the first order in @xmath31 exchange irreducible polarizability diagram . in this sense",
    ", the interaction @xmath76 agrees conceptually with the xc kernel considered in ref .  .",
    "in this section we show how the electron self - energy and the @xmath0 matrix ( [ trialsolutiontype ] ) are related .",
    "as is known,@xcite the electron self - energy obtained from the @xmath0 matrix consists of a direct term and an exchange one ( feynman diagrams are shown in fig . [ sigma_all ] ) .",
    "the direct term @xmath77 has @xmath34 and @xmath35 contributions , while the exchange term @xmath78 is defined by the spin - diagonal part of the @xmath79 matrix only .",

    "it is obvious from eqs .",

    "we notice here that , by substituting the @xmath0 matrix as a solution of eq .",
    "( [ momtmtypegamma3va ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ momsdgamma3 ] ) and ( [ momsexchgamma3 ] ) , one obtains@xcite for the direct term four lowest order diagrams ( shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) which disagree with the solution of the hedin equations.@xcite    in order to avoid this problem , first of all , following refs . and , we merely separate the first order exchange term ( the gwa electron self - energy term @xmath82 ) from others .",
    "next , we formally expand the @xmath0 matrix ( [ trialsolutiontype ] ) into series , put into consideration a new value @xmath83 containing the second ( or third in the @xmath35 case ) and higher order in @xmath84 items , and connect this value with the @xmath0 matrix .",

    "thus , additionally to the @xmath1 term , we obtain as a @xmath0-matrix contribution to the electron self - energy the following : @xmath90 now we have only one term @xmath91 which should be excluded from the @xmath0-matrix contribution ( [ momstlocal ] ) . as a result",

    "the last item is an analog of the so - called double counting term.@xcite in contrast to ref .",

    ", one can , in principle , evaluate the @xmath94-matrix contribution ( [ momstlocal ] ) ( denoted as @xmath95 ) to the self - energy , additionally to the @xmath1 term , by using one of the local - field factors existing in the literature .",
    "but at present it can be seemingly done only for the homogeneous electron gas for which these factors have been obtained and parametrized .    here , in order to roughly estimate the magnitude of @xmath95 , we exploit the static @xmath96 of ref .  .",
    "we have calculated the imaginary part of the electron self - energy for two values of the electron density corresponding to aluminium ( @xmath97 ) and potassium ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ se_jellium ] .",
    "it follows from the figure that in general @xmath95 is essentially less then @xmath99 especially in the region where the decay due to creation of plasmons prevails .",
    "however , in the vicinity of the fermi wave vector the @xmath94-matrix contribution amounts on average to @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) in relation to the @xmath1 term for @xmath97 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this fact says that the contribution in question can be important in calculations of the decay of excited electrons whose initial energy is close to the fermi energy .",
    "it is clear from the insets in fig .",
    "[ se_jellium ] that the multiple scattering leads to shortening of the lifetime of such electrons .",
    "note also that the values of the ratio @xmath103 become greater when the electron density decreases .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a variational solution of the bethe - salpeter equation which determines the @xmath0 matrix describing multiple scattering both between two electrons or two holes and between an electron and a hole .",
    "the solution has been obtained within a local approximation .",
    "the resulting expression for the @xmath0 matrix is similar to that in hubbard models but contains the local interaction depending on momentum and frequency .",
