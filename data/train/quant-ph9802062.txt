    "it is quite possible that the first implementations of quantum computers will not be fully quantum mechanical .",
    "instead , they may have two parts : a quantum part and a classical part with a communication between two parts . in this case , the quantum part will be considerably more expensive than the classical part .",
    "therefore , it will be useful to make the quantum part as small as possible even if it leads to some ( reasonable ) increases in the size of the classical part .",
    "this motivates the study of systems with a small quantum mechanical part .",
    "quantum finite automata ( qfa ) is a theoretical model for such systems .",
    "@xcite introduced both 1-way and 2-way qfas , with emphasis on 2-way automata because they are more powerful .",
    "however , the model of 2-way qfas is not quite consistent with the idea of a system with a small quantum mechanical part .",
    "@xcite allows superpositions where different parts of superposition have the head of qfa at different locations .",
    "( even more , using such superpositions was the main idea in the proof that 2-way qfas are more powerful than classical finite automata . )",
    "this means that the position of the head must be encoded into quantum state .",
    "hence , the number of quantum states necessary to implement a 2-way qfa is not a constant but grows when the size of the input increases .",
    "this also makes state transformations more complicated ( and more difficult to implement ) .",
    "hence , we think that more attention should be given to the study of simpler models like 1-way qfas . a 1-way quantum automaton is a very reasonable model of computation and it is easy to see how it can be implemented .",
    "the finite dimensional state - space of a qfa corresponds to a system with finitely many particles .",
    "each letter has a corresponding unitary transformation on the state - space .",
    "a classical device can read symbols from the input and apply the corresponding transformations to the quantum mechanical part .",
    "results about 1-way qfas in @xcite were quite pessimistic .",
    "it was shown that the class of languages recognized by 1-way qfas is a proper subset of regular languages .",
    "we continue the investigation of 1-way qfas and show that , despite being limited in some situations , they perform well in other situations .",
    "our first results consider relations between 1-way qfas and 1-way reversible automata .",
    "clearly , a 1-way reversible automaton is a special case of a qfa and , therefore , can not recognize all regular languages .",
    "it is a natural question whether 1-way qfas are more powerful than 1-way reversible automata .",
    "interestingly , the answer depends on the accepting probability of a qfa .",
    "if a qfa gives a correct answer with a large probability ( greater than 7/9 ) , it can be replaced by a 1-way reversible automaton . however ,",
    "this is not true for 0.68 ... and smaller probabilities .",
    "then , we show that qfas can be much more space - efficient than deterministic and even probabilistic finite automata . namely , there is a 1-way qfa that can check whether the number of letters received from the input is divisible by a prime @xmath0 with only @xmath1 states ( this is equivalent to @xmath2 bits of memory ) .",
    "any deterministic or probabilistic finite automaton needs @xmath0 states ( @xmath3 bits of memory ) .",
    "we think that this space - efficient quantum algorithm may be interesting for design of other quantum algoritms as well .    finally , we consider modifications of 2-way quantum automata where the head is always at the same position for all parts of superposition",

    "we consider 1-way quantum finite automata ( qfa ) as defined in @xcite .",

    "a 1-way reversible finite automaton ( rfa ) is a qfa with @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "alternatively , rfa can be defined as a deterministic automaton where , for any @xmath76 , there is at most one state @xmath77 such that reading @xmath29 in @xmath77 leads to @xmath78 .",

    "similarly to quantum case , endmarkers are added to the input word .",
    "the starting state is one , accepting ( rejecting ) states can be multiple .",
    "this makes our model different from both @xcite ( where only one accepting state was allowed ) and @xcite ( where multiple starting states with a non - deterministic choice between them at the beginning were allowed ) .",
    "we define our model so because we want it to be as close to our model of qfas as possible .    generally , it s hard to introduce probabilism into finite automata without losing reversibility .",

    "however , there are 3 1-way rfas such that each word in the language is accepted by 2 of them and each word not in the language is rejected by 2 out of 3 . hence ,",
    "if we choose one of these three automata equiprobably , @xmath80 will be recognized with the probability of correct answer @xmath81 .",
    "probabilistic choices of this type can be easily done in our model of qfas .",
    "this may lead to a claim that qfas are more powerful than classical reversible automata because they can do such probabilistic choices .",
    "we wish to avoid such situations and to separate probabilistic choices from real quantum effects .",
    "therefore , we define 1-way finite automata with probabilistic choices ( prfas ) and compare capabilities of qfas with them .",
    "a prfa is a probabilistic finite automaton such that , for any state @xmath77 and any @xmath30 , there is at most one state @xmath78 such that the probability of passing from @xmath78 to @xmath77 after reading @xmath29 is non - zero .",

    "@xmath0 steps a transition to a rejecting state is made with a `` small '' probability @xmath471 .",

    "this 1-way probabilistic automaton is reversible according to the definition of section [ s2 ] .",
    "we can use theorem [ t9 ] to transform it into quantum automaton with the number of states increasing at most twice .",
    "then , we obtain a counterpart of theorem [ t10 ] for quantum case .    however , we can do better by counting modulo prime as in theorem [ t6 ] . for that",

    "after first version of this paper appeared , ambainis , nayak and vazirani@xcite showed that , for a different language , the number of states needed by a 1-way qfa is almost exponentially bigger than the number of states of a 1-way deterministic finite automaton .",
    "the advantage of 1-way quantum automata is the simplicity of this model .",
    "however , we saw that 1-way automata are quite limited in several situations ( despite being good in others ) while @xcite shows that 2-way qfas are strictly more powerful than classical finite automata .",
    "it would be interesting to come up with a model having both advantages , i.e. being both powerful and simple . in the remainder",
    ", we propose several modifications of quantum automata which are intermediate between 1-way qfas and 2-way qfas .",
    "quantum part is kept finite in all of these models .",
    "questions about exact power of these models are mostly open but we have shown that , in most of these models , all regular languages can be recognized and , in at least one of them , non - regular languages can be recognized as well .      the simplest modification is to allow a 1-way qfa to scan its input tape several times ( after the right endmarker it goes to the left endmarker and so on ) .",
    "this is enough to make the proof from @xcite that 1-way qfas recognize only regular languages fail .",
    "if we allow the automaton to reject words by non - halting , a nonregular language can be recognized .",
    "if we require @xmath16 to stop in a rejecting state for rejection , a similar question is still open .",
    "it is also open whether multiple scans of the tape can be used by a 1-way qfa to recognize an arbitrary regular language .",
    "( however , known proofs that 1-way qfas do not recognize some regular languages also fail in this case . )",
    "another possibility is introducing more complicated observables .",
    "we can partition all non - halting states into 2 or 3 classes : moving - left states , moving - right states and ( may be ) non - moving states . then , after each step we observe whether the automaton is in accepting , rejecting , moving - right or moving - left state .",
    "if it is in a halting state , we terminate the computation .",
    "if it is in a moving - right state , we feed it the next letter ( do the transformation on the quantum system corresponding to the next letter ) .",
    "if it is in a moving - left state , we feed it the previous letter .        in this model",

    "@xmath486 is a 2-way deterministic ( or probabilistic ) finite automaton with output and @xmath487 is a 1-way qfa . the input word is given to @xmath486 and @xmath487 is run on the output of @xmath486 .",
    "( this can be viewed as @xmath486 preprocessing the input word . )",
    "again , the model of section [ s51 ] can be viewed as a special case of this model where @xmath486 moves from left to right all the time and outputs all letters that it reads .",
