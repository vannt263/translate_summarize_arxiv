    "the @xmath12  and the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) @xcite have opened new windows into many aspects of star formation and galactic structure .",
    "the glimpse mid - ir survey and many complementary surveys such as mipsgal @xcite at 24 @xmath3 m , 2mass @xcite , and the boston university five college radio astronomy observatory ( bu - fcrao ) galactic ring survey ( grs ) in @xmath2co  @xcite together constitute powerful new probes at 130 arcsecond resolutions of previously obscured components of the milky way .",
    "these overlapping surveys have produced many new discoveries including a new globular cluster @xcite and new young open clusters @xcite .",
    "a more complete census of star clusters enables a better understanding of the galaxy s formation and structure , its star formation history , and its current rate of star formation .",
    "massive stars are rare and short - lived .",
    "a typical 9 m@xmath13  star will spend about 26 myr on the main - sequence , while a 15 m@xmath13  star has a ms lifetime of around 13 myr @xcite . after leaving the main - sequence",
    "these stars begin their helium burning red supergiant ( rsg ) phase .",
    "the he - burning lifetime is about 4 myr for 9 m@xmath13 , 2.5 myr for 15 m@xmath13  and even shorter for higher mass stars @xcite .",
    "this is a very small window for observing these evolved stars and the reason why there are relatively few of them known in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite discovered 5 rsgs in ngc  7419 , and more recently @xcite discovered 14 rsgs and a yellow ( g - type ) supergiant in single galactic cluster .",
    "the current record holder for the most number of rsgs in a single galactic cluster is stephenson  2 , also known as rsgc2 @xcite , which has 26 cluster rsgs .",
    "the number of massive rsgs in a cluster places strong limits on cluster age ( massive stars have not all disappeared yet ) , cluster mass ( enough initial mass to produce large numbers of high mass stars ) , and the duration of the star formation burst that produced the cluster , in that the stars must have formed in a relatively short period to have reached the same evolved state simultaneously . @xcite and",
    "@xcite use an evolved initial - mass function ( imf ) to derive initial cluster masses of 20,000  40,000 m@xmath14 for rsgc1 and rsgc2 .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the discovery of another rsg cluster using methods similar to those of @xcite .",
    "the cluster was discovered serendipitously as a conspicuous grouping of bright red stars while perusing 3-band mid - infrared color mosaics from glimpse . at @xmath15  and @xmath16 ,",
    "the cluster lies in roughly the same direction as the rsg clusters reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use archive data from @xmath17 , 2mass , and the grs , along with new near - ir spectroscopy of nine probable members to constrain the stellar content , age , and distance of this young and massive galactic cluster .",
    "our discovery and analysis make use of archival data from the @xmath12glimpse  i / ii and mipsgal  i legacy surveys .",

    "the @xmath12  mipsgal survey @xcite covers the same region of sky as glimpse but uses the multi - band infrared photometer for spitzer ( mips ) @xcite bandpasses at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath18 .",

    "blue predominantly highlights the stellar photospheres .",
    "green shows diffuse emission from warm molecular cloud interfaces , i.e. , pah emission from photodissociation regions excited by uv photons .",
    "red preferentially reveals warm dust . the scale bar in the lower right shows a linear scale of 10 pc at a distance of 7.0 kpc .",
    "the grouping of bright stars near the center of the image suggests a physical association .",
    "they also lie near a local minimum in the diffuse emission , possibly a cavity sculpted by the winds and energetic photons from young massive stars .",
    "infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) and dark filaments appear superimposed on the bright diffuse background at many locations across this field , indicating the presence of opaque , cold clouds in the foreground .",
    "a handful of very red and bright sources , often coinciding with dark clouds , surround the cluster .",
    "the color and placement of these objects suggest that they are young stellar objects ( ysos ) associated with the ir emission .",
    "we also use photometry from the university of massachusetts two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite , which observed the sky in the near infrared for j ( 1.25 @xmath18 ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath18 ) , and k@xmath26 ( 2.16 @xmath18 ) bands .",

    "the brightest cluster stars are conspicuous as a grouping of yellow - red stars near the center of the image .    nine stars ( numbered 1 through 9 in figure  [ cluster ] )",

    "most stars are saturated in the irac bands .      near - infrared spectroscopy",
    "was conducted using the mimir instrument @xcite on the perkins 1.8  m telescope , located outside flagstaff , arizona , on the ut nights of 2008 may 21 , june 2528 , and september 23 .",

    "read noise is typically 1718 e@xmath28 rms .",

    "all may and some june observations used the 1.16 @xmath3 m lp filter to yield spectra unaliased to 2.27 @xmath3 m , while the remaining june observations use the 1.90 @xmath3 m lp to form spectra to 2.5 @xmath3 m .",
    "september observations used a 1.4 @xmath3 m lp to simultaneously observe the full h and k bands .",
    "the slit used has projected sizes of 1.2 arcsec ( 2 pixels ) by 5 arcmin and was oriented north - south .",

    "this a - b cycle was repeated for 5 or 6 pairs .",
    "the dome was rotated to cover the telescope beam , and exposures were taken with continuum lamps on and off in order to produce spectral flat - fields .",
    "spectral images of an argon lamp positioned over the slit were obtained for wavelength calibration . for calibration of the wavelength dependence of atmospheric transmission , spectroscopy of bright a0v stars",
    "was performed using all of the same steps , for stars chosen to be within 15 degrees and 0.1 airmasses of the target stars .",
    "data reduction used custom idl - based programs that included measuring and correcting the non - linear response of the insb photovoltaic pixels , using the fourth - order method described in @xcite , in addition to the usual dark and flat - field corrections .",
    "wavelength calibration utilized the argon spectra to ascertain the 2-d spatial - dispersion coefficients necessary to remap the spectral images into uniformly dispersed versions .",
    "typical dispersion solution scatter was at or under 0.1 pixels ( 0.14 nm ) for all argon spectra .",
    "target spectral images were flattened , interpolated , and remapped to 20 subpixels for each raw pixel , then rebinned to twice the original dispersion to achieve a fixed channel spacing and common reference wavelength .",
    "spectra were modeled on the images as sloped lines with `` bow tie '' spatially - broadened extrema , due to the grism action .",
    "spectra were extracted from the modeled locations by fitting locally sloped backgrounds at each spectral channel outside the spatial extent covered by the spectra , then integrating the signal above the background over the 23 rows showing significant emission .",
    "noise was estimated for each extracted spectral channel based on gaussian read noise and poisson background and signal contributions .",
    "this somewhat overestimates the noise for these 2:1 synthetic channels .",
    "relative scaling factors for each of the 1012 spectra for a target were found across either the h- or k - band .",
    "for each spectral channel , the 1012 scaled values were tested to remove bad pixels or cosmic rays , using median filtering .",
    "the surviving data were averaged using weighting by inverse noise squared .",
    "telluric spectra were developed using the a0v standard star extracted spectra and the spextool program xtelcor by @xcite and used to correct the target star spectra .",
    "the final spectra were flattened by identifying wavelengths free of lines , fitting baselines , and dividing by the baseline functions to yield relative intensity spectra .",
    "the resulting spectra , normalized by their error - propagated noise spectra , showed signal - to - noise ratios of 200 - 450 .",

    "eight of the nine stars ( s1 and s3 through s9 ) show deep co bandhead features near 2.3 @xmath3 m , characteristic of cool , evolved stars .",
    "these spectra are most consistent with late - type giants or supergiants .",
    "star s2 , unlike the rest , is best matched with an early a or late b supergiant spectrum .",
    "this determination is based on the presence of strong brackett series features in the h - band and brackett @xmath34 near 2.17 @xmath3 m .",
    "the h - band brackett lines of s2 were only about half as wide as the same lines in the a0v comparison stars , confirming its low - gravity , supergiant status .",
    "the lack of molecular absorption features ( e.g. , co ) is another indication that s2 is an early - type star .    following the method outlined by @xcite",
    "( see their figure  8) , we measured the equivalent width ( ew ) of the first @xmath35co overtone feature at 2.30 @xmath3 m for each star ( except s2 as it shows no co absorption ) .",

    "the giants show systematically lower ew than supergiants for a given spectral type .",
    "the strong correlation between ew and spectral type , along with the systematic differences between giants and supergiants , shows that even at relatively low spectral resolution , our ir spectra can be used to discern spectral and luminosity classes .",

    "the difference between the slopes corresponds to @xmath37(j - h ) = 0.25 over 12 magnitudes of visual extinction .",

    "for the fifth feature , with a peak at 95 km  s@xmath5 , a strong correlation of the co distribution with the glimpse 8 @xmath3 m distribution was seen , as was a distinct anticorrelation with the location of the stellar cluster .    in figure",

    "this @xmath2co  minimum coincides with the 8.0 @xmath18 hole discussed earlier in connection with figure  [ cluster ] .",
