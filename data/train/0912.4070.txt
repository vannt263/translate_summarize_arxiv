    "polyelectrolytes ( pes ) , such as dna molecules and many synthetic polymers , are macromolecules carrying a large number of charged groups which are ionizable in water . the presence of long - ranged electrostatic interaction and the confinement of charges on chains , together with the degree of freedom of chain conformation , make this kind of system very complicated and unpredictable .",
    "the behavior of pes is greatly influenced by ions in the solutions , owing to the screening effect and ionic redistribution .",
    "for example , addition of salt in the solutions , especially multivalent salt , can change drastically the properties of pes  @xcite .",
    "when salt is added , the multivalent counterions dissociated from the salt can compete with the monovalent ones in the solutions and condense onto pe chains , which eventually leads the system to a series of phase transition .",
    "the condensation of multivalent counterions is a process of both energetic and entropic favor because a @xmath0-valent counterion ( @xmath1 ) attracting to a pe chain is @xmath0 times stronger than a monovalent one and the release of @xmath0 monovalent counterions into the solution , due to the condensation of the @xmath0-valent counterion , also increases the system entropy  @xcite .",
    "a phase separation takes place when salt concentration is higher than a critical value .",
    "the chains collapse and aggregate in the solution , resulting in a precipitation from the solution .",
    "when the salt concentration is further increased and goes beyond a second critical value , the precipitated pes redissolve back into the solution . the system returns to a homogeneous phase  @xcite .",
    "the phase transition occurred at the first critical salt concentration is a result of ionic screening and bridging of multivalent counterions bound near pes  @xcite .",
    "the transition occurred at the second one exists several explanations  @xcite .",
    "one of them attributes the resolubilization of pes to the occurrence of charge inversion of pes  @xcite .",
    "it argues that the condensed multivalent counterions can overcompensate the chain charge when salt concentration is high , and the repulsive force between chain segments due to the charge of inverted sign at that moment causes the segregation and resolubilization of chains .",
    "another theory considers the bjerrum association between ions  @xcite . by using a two - state model of chain",
    ", it predicts the possibility of either sign of the effective chain charge under different conditions .",
    "these theories usually over - simplifies the situations and are constructed based upon certain preassumed chain conformation and ion distribution .",
    "further verification is thus needed . to understand the systems , it is important to study chain conformation and ion distributions around a chain in solutions .",
    "we have investigated the first issue , the effect of chain stiffness on pe chain conformation , in our previous paper  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the second issue : the ion distribution .",
    "to investigate ion distributions directly from experiments is difficult .",
    "computer simulation , on the contrary , can do it easily because the positions of atoms are explicitely given in the study .",
    "this issue can be investigated on different scales  @xcite .",
    "an all - atom model , which simulates molecules with detailed chemical composition and structure , are usually applied in the study of small systems for short simulation time , owing to high computational cost related to today s computer power  @xcite .",
    "space and time scales are both restricted . a coarse - grained model , which reduces the complexity of the molecular structure by grouping atoms , on the other hands , can decrease significantly the computational cost .",
    "researchers can hence investigate larger systems evolving over a longer simulation time . using coarse - grained models ,",
    "scientists have investigated ion distribution and effective interaction and free energy of dna molecule systems  @xcite .",
    "the chains were modeled by an infinitively long post through periodic boundary condition .",
    "this model preserved the dna helical structure and can be used to study local structural transitions , such as the b - to - z transition , in addition to the ion distribution .",
    "however , it fails to characterize the global chain conformation , as what happened in dna condensation when polyvalent ions are added into the solution .    to study the collapse and the reexpansion of single pe chains ,",
    "bead - spring chain models are usually employed  @xcite .",
    "this kind of simple models allows people to investigate the behavior of pe systems in a large space and time scale . by exploiting it",
    ", researchers have demonstrated that various conformational transitions of pe chains take places under different conditions .",
    "the models could be hence good candidates in the study of ion distribution related to the chain conformations .",
    "liu and muthukumar showed that a chain can be collapsed in a salt - free solution when coulomb coupling strength is strong  @xcite .",
    "their study reveals the relation between counterion condensation and the formation of local dipole moment .",
    "hsiao and luijten studied how pe chains are collapsed in multivalent salt solutions  @xcite .",
    "they found that the chains are charge overcompensated at their very surface when the amount of the multivalent counterions of salt is greater than the amount needed to neutralize the bare chain charge  @xcite .",
    "counterion condensation on a pe chain has also been studied by several groups  @xcite . however , these studies aimed to understand the collapse transition of chain happened in salt - free or low - salt conditions .",
    "the information concerning the unfolding transition of chain provoked by high concentration of counterions was missing . in this work ,",
    "we plane to study the ion distribution around a pe chain in solutions over a wide range of salt concentration , so wide that single chains can subsequently undergo collapse and reexpansion transitions , using a bead - spring chain model",
    ". the focus will be the exploitation of the ion distribution at different salt concentrations and the relation with the chain conformation .",
    "it is known that the structure of collapsed pe chains depends sensitively on the chain rigidity  @xcite .",
    "studies also showed that the rigidity determines the transition of chain conformation to be continuous or discrete  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , very relevant to know how ion distributions are influenced by the chain rigidity in the problem of pe condensation .",
    "ou and muthukumar observed that the number of the condensed monovalent counterions on a chain decreases in a salt - free solution when chain stiffness increases  @xcite .",
    "sarragua and pais studied pe chains collapse by trivalent salt in different circumstances  @xcite .",
    "they found that the density of trivalent ions around stiff chains is smaller than around flexible ones .",
    "moreover , flexible chains are compacted into smaller dimensions and the ion correlation is strong due to small volume of the confinement . nonetheless , the situation for high salt concentrations where chain reexpansion occurs was not discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our model and the simulation setup in section  [ sec_model_setup ] .",
    "the results and discussions are given in section  [ sec_results ] .",
    "after a short revisit of the dependence of chain size and morphology on the salt concentrations for flexible , semiflexible and rigid chains in section  [ subsec_chain_size ] , we investigate various ion distributions in pe solutions .",
    "the topics include the integrated ion distribution in the radial direction of a chain ( section  [ subsec_ion_dist_in_chain_radial_direction ] ) , the charge distribution ( section  [ subsec_charge_dist_in_chain_radial_direction ] ) , the ion condensation and the effective chain charge ( section  [ subsec_ion_condensation_&_effective_charge ] ) , the condensed ion distribution along a chain backbone ( section  [ subsec_dist_cond_ion_along_chain ] ) , and the radial distribution functions ( section  [ subsec_rdf ] ) . by investigating these topics",
    ", we can make connection between ion distributions and chain conformations and understand the role of chain stiffness in different salt regions .",
    "moreover , the results obtained from the rigid - chain case provide a direct verification of the manning condensation theory by simulations .",
    "we give our conclusions in section  [ subsec_conclusions ] .",
    "our system consists of a pe chain and tetravalent salt molecules , placed in a cubic box with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the chain dissociates into a polyion and many counterions .",
    "the polyion is modeled by a bead - spring chain and comprises 48 beads .",
    "each bead carries a negative unit charge @xmath2 .",
    "the counterions are modeled by charged spheres , carrying a @xmath3 charge each .",
    "the tetravalent salt dissociates into tetravalent cation ( counterions ) and monovalent anions ( coions ) .",
    "these ions are also modeled by charged spheres .",
    "solvent molecules are not explicitly incorporated in the study . nonetheless , we consider the entire solvent as a dielectric medium with dielectric constant equal to @xmath4 .",
    "we consider two kinds of non - bonded interactions : the excluded volume interaction and the coulomb interaction , applied to all the beads on the chain and spheres in the system , and two kinds of bonded interactions : the connectivity and the chain rigidity , applied solely to the chain .",
    "the excluded volume is modeled by a purely repulsive lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath5 + \\varepsilon_{lj } & \\mbox{for } r \\leq 2^{1/6 } \\sigma\\\\ 0 & \\mbox{for } r > 2^{1/6 } \\sigma \\end{array}\\right.\\]]where @xmath6 is the distance , @xmath7 is the interaction strength and @xmath8 represents the diameter of a particle .",
    "we assume identical @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the ion spheres and monomer beads .",
    "the coulomb interaction between two charged ions or beads is given by @xmath9where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are charge valences , @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 is the temperature , and @xmath14 is the bjerrum length ( @xmath15 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath4 the solvent dielectric constant ) .",
    "the connectivity of two consecutive beads on the chain is described by a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential @xmath16where @xmath17 is the length of a bond , @xmath18 is the maximum bond extention , and @xmath19 is the spring constant .",
    "the chain rigidity is represented by a harmonic angle potential , @xmath20where @xmath21 is the bond angle between two consecutive bonds and @xmath22 is the force constant .",
    "in addition to the above interactions , two more forces are exerted on each particle .",
    "they are ( 1 ) a dissipative force , which takes into account the friction force due to the particle moving through the solvent , and ( 2 ) a stochastic force , which models the thermal collisions by solvent molecules .",
    "the equation of motion , also known as the langevin equation , reads as @xmath23where @xmath24 is the mass of particle , @xmath25 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath26 is the stochastic force . we have assumed identical @xmath24 and @xmath25 for all the particles .",
    "the system reaches an equilibrium state with the temperature given by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath27where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the kronecker and the dirac delta functions , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath25 is set to @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 ) to mimic aqueous solutions .",
    "these setups give a linear charge density of chain corresponding to a value typically for many polyelectrolyte systems , such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate .",
    "we varied @xmath22 over a large range from 0 to @xmath36 to study the effect of chain stiffness .",
    "the values cover three typical chain stiffness : flexible chains , semiflexible chains , and rigid chains ( see explanation in section  [ subsec_chain_size ] ) . the ( 4:1)-salt concentration @xmath37 is varied from @xmath38 to @xmath39 whereas the monomer concentration @xmath40 is fixed at @xmath41 .",
    "the size of the simulation box is @xmath42 , which is large enough to avoid chain overlapping under periodic boundary condition .",
    "therefore , the studied case is a dilute pe solution .",
    "it has been shown in experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite that pes show similar condensation and decondensation behavior in the dilute region .",
    "the largest system in our study contains totally 7776 charged particles .",

    "an equilibration phase takes about @xmath44 time steps of run , followed by a production phase cumulating data for @xmath44 to @xmath45 time steps . in order to sample sufficiently the data ,",

    "in this section , we shortly revisit some of the major findings obtained in our previous work  @xcite , how the chain size and morphology depend on the chain stiffness in multivalent salt solutions , to give readers a thorough picture of the system .",
    "the detailed discussions can be found in the paper  @xcite .",
    "starting from the next section , we will study ion distributions and show that they depend strongly on the size and the morphology of pe chains in solutions .",

    "snapshots of some typical chain structures at the points ( i ) to ( vii ) are shown by the side of the figure.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we can see that the curves show different variations against @xmath37 , depending on the chain stiffness .",
    "these variations can be classified into three types .",
    "the first type is attributed to the case of small @xmath49 such as @xmath53 .",
    "the chain is said _",
    "flexible _ and @xmath51 in the semi - log plot looks similar to a tilted - l curve .",
    "the second type is addressed to intermediate @xmath49 , such as @xmath54 .",
    "the chain is called _ semiflexible _ , for which the @xmath51 curve takes a shape similar to the letter u. the third type is ascribed to large @xmath49 like @xmath55 .",
    "the chain is very stiff and there is basically no variation against @xmath37 ; we are in the case of _ rigid _ chains .",
    "snapshots for these three types of variations are shown by the side of the figure . for a flexible chain ( snapshots ( i ) to ( iii ) ) , the chain size decreases gradually as @xmath37 increases up to @xmath56 ; the chain undergoes a continuous coil - to - globule transition .",
    "the chain size then turns to increase slowly when @xmath57 , indicating a swelling transition .",
    "@xmath56 is found equal to @xmath58 , the equivalence point . at this particular salt concentration ,",
    "the added tetravalent counterions are in charge equivalence with the bare charge of the pe chain .",
    "we observed that the chain displays a disordered , globule structure at @xmath56 . for a semiflexible chain ( snapshots ( iv ) to ( vi ) ) , two sharp transitions take place at low and at high salt concentrations , respectively .",
    "they are , in turn , the coil - to - globule and the globule - to - coil transitions .",
    "it has been shown that these two transitions occur in a discrete manner  @xcite , in contrast to the continuous transitions happened for a flexible chain . in the region between the two salt concentrations ,",
    "the chain is in a collapsed state and exhibits a compact ordered structure , such as a toroidal structure or a folded - chain structure . outside the salt region",
    ", the chain structure becomes extended .",
    "this kind of phenomena is called `` reentrant condensation '' and has attracted much attention in the study of dna condensation  @xcite .",
    "for the case of a rigid chain ( snapshot ( vii ) ) , the chain is so stiff that it can not be folded by the condensed multivalent counterions .",
    "the chain stays elongated , no matter how many salts are added in the solution .",
    "in addition to the chain size and morphology , which are global properties of chain in solutions , we studied also local properties such as the average bond length .",

    "it then stays basically at a constant for @xmath57 .",
    "the maximum reduction of @xmath59 is less than @xmath62 .",
    "we remark that this decreasing in @xmath59 is a result of the condensation of multivalent counterions on a pe chain , which form triplets with monomers ( as we will see in section [ subsec_rdf ] ) and hence pull closer the distance between two neighboring monomers via the coulomb interaction . in the region @xmath57 , although the chains are charge overcompensated ( cf . fig .",
    "[ f : tube_rc3 ] ) , the extra number of the condensed ions can not pull closer the monomer - monomer distance anymore due to the excluded volume effect .",
    "@xmath59 is thus saturated at a constant value .",
    "combining with the information that @xmath51 increases when @xmath57 , we know that the bond length is not responsible for the global chain reexpansion in this region .      after knowing the morphology of pes in different salt and chain stiffness conditions , we study now different kinds of ion distributions and their relation with the chain morphology .",

    ", we see only about 20 monovalent counterions condensing on the chain ( inside the tube region with @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is because the tetravalent counterions added in the solution compete with the monovalent ones and replace part of the condensed monovalent counterions on the chain .",
    "therefore , the number of condensed monovalent counterions is smaller than that in the sat - free solution .",
    "moreover , we observed that when @xmath79 , the integrated number @xmath64 for tetravalent counterions is a constant .",

    "there are hence non - condensed tetravalent counterions presented in the bulk solution .",
    "form the above three figures , we can see that the ion distributions depend strongly on the chain morphology .",
    "for example , at low @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ f : iondist3](a ) ) , the morphology of the flexible chain ( @xmath53 ) is an extended coil , whereas the semiflexible chain ( @xmath54 ) is elongated and rodlike , resembling the rigid chain ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "@xmath64 curves are therefore non - identical for the three chain stiffness .",
    "the ion distributions for the semiflexible chain ( @xmath54 ) were further investigated in detail in the middle salt region because in this region the chains can collapse into one of the two typical structures : toroid and hairpin structures .",
    "we observed that ( in fig .",
    "[ f : iondist - semi](a ) ) toroidal chains and hairpin chains show similar ion distributions .",

    "consequently , the ion distributions look similar along the viewpoint of the chain radial direction .",
    "moreover , when the salt concentration is close to the globule - to - coil transition , our previous study showed that the semiflexible chains can alter between three structures : the toroid , the hairpin and the extended - rod structures  @xcite . since the toroid and the hairpin structures give a similar distribution of ions around a chain , it is relevant to verify whether or not the @xmath64 curve for the extended - rod chain structure is also distinguishable to the collapsed chain structures ( toroid and hairpin ) .",

    "the higher the salt concentration , the more pronounced the peak will be .",
    "moreover , we found that the rigid and the semiflexible chains are more overcharged than the flexible chain .",

    "we note that in this salt region , the tetravalent counterions are not always condensed on the chain ; in other words , fraction of them stay in the bulk solution .",
    "since the chain charge is effectively positive , the coions can be attracted toward the chain but not the monovalent counterions .",

    "[ f : tube_rc3](b ) ) .",
    "we observed that @xmath94 behaves similarly to @xmath93 , which split into curves depending on the chain stiffness .",

    "it shows that the counterions are more likely to condense on the central part than on the two ends .",
    "when condensing onto the central part , a counterion is attracted by the monomers from both sides of the chain , while it is attracted only by one side of the chain if the condensation occurs near the chain ends .",
    "the coulomb attraction is therefore stronger for the former case , and as a consequence , the condensed counterions are more numerous in the chain center .",
    "the results are in agreement with the works done by other groups  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found that the value at the plateau is higher for the flexible chain than for the rigid chain , which shows that monovalent counterions condense more strongly when the chain is flexible .",
    "we know that a flexible chain displays a zig - zagged structure when counterions condense onto it and becomes less extensive compared to a semiflexible chain and a rigid chain  @xcite . consequently , the line charge density on a flexible chain is effectively higher , which can lead to a stronger ion condensation . to examine it , we calculated the average angle @xmath109 between two adjacent bonds for the three cases of chain stiffness , and the results are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 for the flexible ( @xmath53 ) , the semiflexible ( @xmath54 ) , and the rigid ( @xmath55 ) chains , respectively",
    ". the effective charge distance in the main direction of the zig - zagged chain axis thus can be estimated by @xmath113 . to adapt it for the chains with flexibility , we modify the manning condensation theory by replacing the charge distance on the chains with the effective charge distance .",
    "the modified theory predicts a fraction of charge neutralization on the chains equal to @xmath114 , which yields 0.665 , 0.622 , and 0.617 condensed monovalent counterions per monomer for the three studied stiffness , respectively .",
    "our simulations show consistent trend of behavior with the theory . nonetheless , the numbers are slightly smaller than the predictions .",
    "this is because the manning theory was derived under the assumption of pointlike ions condensing onto an infinite cylindrical chain .",
    "our modeling ions have excluded volume and the pe chain has finite chain length ; both of the effects can decrease the number of the condensed ions . to verify it ,",
    "identical simulations have been performed for the rigid chain ( @xmath55 ) except that the counterions were set to be half of the original ion size . the result is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : ionpos_s0 ] in dash - dotted curve ( denoted by @xmath108 ) for comparison .",
    "we observed that the number of the condensed ions increases , which shows the importance of ion excluded volume on ion condensation . here , the distance of closest approach between the monomer and the counterion is also a relevant parameter .",
    "the smaller the ion size , the closer the distance , and therefore , the stronger the condensation .",
    "we next concentrate on the systems with added tetravalent salt .",
    "since the tetravalent counterions play a crucial role in determination of chain morphology by substituting the condensed monovalent counterions on a chain , we study here how the condensed tetravalent counterions distribute on a chain .    fig .",

    "the distribution profile looks similarly to that for monovalent counterions in salt - free solution .",
    "this is because many monovalent counterions still condense on the chain ( cf .",
    "[ f : tube_rc3](a ) ) and collide with the condensed tetravalent counterions .",
    "the condensed tetravalent ions thus diffuse on the chain , resulting in a uniform distribution . as @xmath37 increases",
    ", the condensation of tetravalent counterions ensures a rapid decrease of the number of the condensed monovalent counterions .",
    "eventually , the tetravalent ions become the majority on the chain and the strong electrostatic repulsion between them induces the localization of these ions at some specific positions along the one - dimensional chain .",
    "this is why at @xmath117 and @xmath118 , several peaks appear on the distribution profile .",
    "the number of the peaks corresponds to the number of the tetravalent ions condensed on the chain , which is exactly the amount of these ions added in the simulation box ( cf .",

    "charge overcompensation takes place .",
    "the ion localization is now disturbed by these extra ions .",
    "the disturbing shows its effect starting from the central part of the chain and propagating to the chain ends with increasing the salt concentration .",
    "finally , the distribution becomes uniform again .",
    "we found that , different to the cases at low salt concentrations , the tetravalent ions favor to condense on the chain ends when @xmath37 is high .",
    "this is because near the chain ends , there are more spaces available to accommodate these over - crowded ions .",
    "[ f : ionpos_4+](b ) shows the distribution on the semiflexible chain ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "when @xmath120 or @xmath121 , the pe chain displays an extended structure .",
    "similar to the rigid chain , the condensed tetravalent ions distribute uniformly on the chain backbone . in between the salt concentrations , the chain forms ordered collapsed structure and the distribution displays some specific profile .",
    "for example , at @xmath122 , the distribution shows a symmetric profile with two humps .",
    "this profile results from a particular hairpin structure in which the length of the two branches of the hairpin is not equal ( cf .  snapshots in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots ] ) .",
    "each hump in the distribution reflects the drastic change of chain geometry at an eccentric bending point of the hairpin .",
    "we note that the appearance of the two humps do not mean two bendings in one hairpin .",
    "it is a result of ensemble average in which the probability of the bending point close to one of the two chain ends is equal when the system is in equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the distribution is a symmetric function with respect to the middle point . at @xmath117 and @xmath58 ,",
    "the number of the condensed ions is sufficiently numerous to bind the chain , against the chain stiffness , to form a hairpin with two equal branches ( cf .",
    "[ f : snapshots ] ) .",
    "a condensed counterion is localized at the bending point , which results in the peak at the middle point of the chain . for @xmath123 ,",

    "we remark that when @xmath124 , toroid is also a favored structure of the chain .",
    "the ion distribution on toroidal structure is similar to the one on a hairpin ( or a racquet ) , which displays a hump in the middle . to help readers to obtain the whole pictures of the system in mind , we present in fig .  [",

    "[ f : ionpos_4+](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , we noticed that the number of the condensed tetravalent counterions is less numerous for the flexible chain than for the semiflexible and the rigid chains when @xmath57 .",
    "the reason is that the flexible chain occupies a smaller volume space compared to the other two chain stiffness ( cf .",
    "[ f : rhvcs ] ) .",

    "similar triplet formation has been reported by other group using monovalent counterions , instead  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath133 , the distribution functions overlap with each other .",

    "[ f : rdf_m4+](b ) . however , these peaks are broader and less pronounced , in comparison with the previous case , because thermal fluctuations can take effect on chain conformation for this chain stiffness .",

    "a broad shoulder appears on the right - hand side .",
    "the shoulder narrows down to a finite region when the salt concentration is increased from @xmath136 to @xmath58 .",
    "this behavior reflects two facts : ( 1 ) the nature of random arrangement of tetravalent counterions surrounding a monomer when the chain is flexible , ( 2 ) the reduction of chain size in the intermediate salt region .",
    "using langevin dynamics simulations , we have studied ion and charge distributions in pe solutions from various points of view . the discussed topics focused on the effects of the two parameters : the salt concentration and the chain stiffness .",
    "the salt concentration ran over a wide range of value in which the reentrant condensation takes place , and the chain stiffness covers the three types of behavior discussed in section  [ subsec_chain_size ] .",
    "the results showed that the ion and the charge distributions depend strongly on the morphology of a chain , while the morphology is determined by both of the two parameters . when the salt concentration is low and can not induce collapse of chain , the ion distribution shows similar profile for flexible , semiflexible and rigid chains , because these chains all display extended structures . in the middle salt region , the chain charge is nearly neutralized by the condensed multivalent counterions .",
    "the chains show drastic conformational change .",
    "the flexible chains are collapsed into disordered globule structures whereas the semiflexible chains are collapsed into ordered structures such as toroid and hairpin . for the rigid chains , the chain conformation remains rodlike .",
    "since the chain morphologies are different for these three kinds of chain stiffness , the ion distributions show significant difference .",
    "a general rule is that the larger the space that a chain structure occupies , the more the ions can condense on a chain .",
    "therefore , the number of the condensed ions and the effective chain charge for the semiflexible chains are upper- and lower - bounded by those curves for the flexible and the rigid chains , respectively . in the high - salt region ,",
    "the condensed multivalent counterions overcompensate the chain charge on the chain surface .",

    "the condensed ions distribute uniformly on the chain backbone ( because the chain is not collapsed ) , whereas at intermediate salt concentrations , the distribution showed specific profile which has direct connection with the structure of the collapsed chains .",
    "finally , in the study of the radial distribution function , we demonstrated that a condensed multivalent counterion favors to form a triplet with two adjacent monomers .",

    "we know that flexible chains and semiflexible chains are both collapsed and charge - neutralized at the equivalence point @xmath56 .",
    "further condensing the multivalent counterions leads to the arising of the repulsive forces , including the coulomb repulsion and the excluded volume interaction , in the interior of the collapsed chain structures .",

    "similar results have been reported recently in the simulation study of other flexible charged systems , such as dendrimers  @xcite and spherical polyelectrolyte brushes  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the dendrimers and the pe brushes were collapsed by multivalent salt and oppositely charged linear pes , respectively . when the concentration of these condensing agents is higher than the equivalence point , the collapsed structures reswell due to the excluded volume and the repulsive interactions of the condensing agents excessively adsorbed on the systems .",
    "the reswelling goes in a continuous way  @xcite . for a semiflexible chain , there exists , in addition , a restoring force , owing to the intrinsic chain stiffness , which plays a crucial role in the chain reexpansion .",
