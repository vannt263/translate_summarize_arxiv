    "physicists are increasingly interested in economic time series analysis for several reasons , among which are the following : ( _ i _ ) economic time series , such as stock market indices or currency exchange rates , depend on the evolution of a large number of interacting systems , and so is an example of complex evolving systems widely studied in physics .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the recent availability of large amounts of data allows the study of economic time series with a high accuracy on a wide range of time scales varying from @xmath8 minute up to @xmath9year .",
    "consequently , a large number of methods developed in statistical physics have been applied to characterize the time evolution of stock prices and foreign exchange rates  .",
    "previous studies   show that the stochastic process underlying price changes is characterized by several features .",
    "the distribution of price changes has pronounced tails   in contrast to a gaussian distribution .",
    "the autocorrelation function of price changes decays exponentially with a characteristic time of approximately @xmath10min .",
    "however , recent studies  @xcite show that the amplitude of price changes , measured by the absolute value or the square , shows power law correlations with long - range persistence up to several months .",
    "these long - range dependencies are better modeled by defining a `` subsidiary process ''  @xcite , often referred to as the _ volatility _ in economic literature .",
    "the volatility of stock price changes is a measure of how much the market is liable to fluctuate .",
    "the first step is to construct an estimator for the volatility . here",
    ", we estimate the volatility as the local average of the absolute price changes .    understanding the statistical properties of the volatility also has important practical implications .",
    "volatility is of interest to traders because it quantifies the risk  @xcite and is the key input of virtually all option pricing models , including the classic black and scholes model and the cox , ross , and rubinstein binomial models that are based on estimates of the asset s volatility over the remaining life of the option  @xcite . without an efficient volatility estimate",
    ", it would be difficult for traders to identify situations in which options appear to be under - priced or overpriced .",
    "we focus on two basic statistical properties of the volatility  the probability distribution function and the two - point autocorrelation function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly describe the databases used in this study , the s&p 500 stock index and individual company stock prices . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the quantification of volatility . in section 4 , the probability distribution function",
    "is studied , and in section 5 , the volatility correlations are studied .",
    "the appendix briefly describes a recently - developed method , called detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) that we use to quantify power - law correlations .",
    "the s&p 500 index from the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) consists of 500 companies chosen for their market size , liquidity , and industry group representation in the us .",
    "it is a market - value weighted index , i.e. , each stock is weighted proportional to its stock price times number of shares outstanding .",
    "the s&p 500 index is one of the most widely used benchmarks of u.s . equity performance .",
    "we analyze the s&p 500 historical data , for the 13-year period jan 1984 to dec 1996 ( fig .  [ index - gt](a ) ) with a recording frequency of @xmath11 seconds intervals .",
    "the total number of data points in this 13-year period exceed 4.5 million , and allows for a detailed statistical analysis .",
    "we also analyze the trades and quotes ( taq ) database which documents every trade for all the securities listed in the three major us stock markets  the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , the american stock exchange ( amex ) , and the national association of securities dealers automated quotation ( nasdaq)for the 2-year period from jan .",

    "we study the market capitalizations  @xcite for the 500 largest companies , ranked according to the market capitalization on jan .  1 1994 .",
    "the s&p500 index at anytime is approximately the sum of market capitalizations of these 500 companies@xcite .",
    "the total number of data points analyzed exceed 20  million .",
    "the term volatility represents a generic measure of the magnitude of market fluctuations .",
    "thus , many different quantitative definitions of volatility are use in the literature . in this study",
    ", we focus on one of these measures by estimating the volatility as the local average of absolute price changes over a suitable time interval @xmath12 , which is an adjustable parameter of our estimate .    fig .",

    "we only count time during opening hours of the stock market , and remove the nights , weekends and holidays from the data set , i.e. , the closing and the next opening of the market is considered to be continuous .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath14 describes the amplitude of the fluctuation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ index - gt](b ) . in comparison to fig .  [ index - gt](a ) ,",
    "[ index - gt](b ) does not show visible global trends due to the logarithmic difference .",
    "the large values of @xmath17 correspond to the crashes and big rallies .",
    "we define the volatility as the average of @xmath17 over a time window @xmath18 , i.e. ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is an integer .",
    "the above definition can be generalized  @xcite by replacing @xmath17 with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 gives more weight to the large values of @xmath17 and @xmath23 weights the small values of @xmath17 .",
    "there are two parameters in this definition of volatility , @xmath16 and @xmath20 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the sampling time interval for the data and the parameter @xmath20 is the moving average window size .",
    "note that the definition of the volatility has an intrinsic error associated with it . in principle , the larger the choice of time interval @xmath12 , the more accurate the volatility estimation .",
    "however , a large value of @xmath12 also implies poor resolution in time .",
    "[ vol_def ] shows the calculated volatility @xmath24 for a large averaging window @xmath25min ( about 1@xmath26month ) with @xmath27min .",
    "the volatility fluctuates strongly during the crash of 87 .",
    "we also note that periods of high volatility are not sparse but tend to `` cluster '' .",
    "this clustering is especially marked around the 87 crash .",
    "the oscillatory patterns before the crash could be possible precursors ( possibly related to the oscillatory patterns postulated in  @xcite ) .",
    "clustering also occurs in other periods , e.g.  in the second half of 90 .",
    "there are also extended periods where the volatility remains at a rather low level , e.g.  the years of 85 and 93 .",

    "the distributions of volatility @xmath30 , for various choices of @xmath12 ( from @xmath31  min up to @xmath32  min ) , collapse onto one curve and are well fit in the center by a quadratic function on a log - log scale .",
    "since the central limit theorem holds also for correlated series  @xcite , with a slower convergence than for non - correlated processes  @xcite , in the limit of large values of @xmath12 , one expects that @xmath28 becomes gaussian .",
    "however , a log - normal distribution fits the data better than a gaussian , as is evident in fig .",
    "[ log2 ] which compares the best log - normal fit with the best gaussian fit for the data  @xcite .",
    "the apparent scaling behavior of volatility distribution could be attributed to the long persistence of its autocorrelation function  @xcite ( section 5 ) .",
    "although the log - normal seems to describe well the center part of the volatility distribution , fig .",
    "[ lognormal](a ) suggests that the distribution of the volatility has quite different behavior in the tail . since our time window @xmath12 for estimating volatility is quite large",
    ", it is difficult to obtain significant statistics for the tail .",
    "recent studies of the distribution for price changes report power law asymptotic behavior  @xcite . since the volatility is the local average of the absolute price changes , it is possible that a similar power law asymptotic behavior might characterize the distribution of the volatility .",
    "hence we reduce the time window @xmath12 and focus on the `` tail '' of the volatility .",
    "we compute the cumulative distribution of the volatility .",
    "( [ defv ] ) for different time scales , fig .",
    "[ cum_sp](a ) .",

    "the asymptotic behavior of the cumulative volatility distribution is well described by a power law behavior with exponent @xmath57 for the s&p 500 index .",
    "this power law behavior also holds for individual companies with similar exponent @xmath58 for the cumulative distribution , with a drop - off at low values .",
    "unlike price changes that are correlated only on very short time scales  @xcite(a few minutes ) , the absolute values of price changes show long - range power - law correlations on time scales up to a year or more  @xcite .",
    "previous works have shown that understanding the power - law correlations , specifically the values of the exponents , can be helpful for guiding the selection of models and mechanisms  @xcite .",

    "since we find the volatility to be power - law distributed at the tail , to test that the power - law correlation is not a spurious artifact of the long - tailed probability distribution , we shuffled each point of the @xmath71 randomly for the s&p500 data .",

    "the long range correlation and the crossover behavior observed for the s&p500 index are for the entire 13-year period .",
    "next , we study whether the exponents characterizing the power - law correlation are stable , i.e. does it still hold for periods smaller than 13 years .",
    "we choose a sliding window ( with size 1@xmath26y ) and calculate both exponents @xmath100 and @xmath101 within this window as the window is dragged down the data set with one month steps .",
    "we find ( fig .  [ alpha](b ) ) that the value of @xmath100 is very `` stable '' ( independent of the position of the window ) , fluctuating slightly around the mean value 2/3 .",
    "however , the variation of @xmath101 is much greater , showing sudden jumps when very volatile periods enter or leave the time window .",
    "note that the error in estimating @xmath101 is also large .",
    "in this study , we find that the probability density function of the volatility for the s&p 500 index seems to be well fit by a log normal distribution in the center part . however , the tail of the distribution is better described by a power law , with exponent @xmath102 , well outside the stable lvy range .",
    "the power law distribution at the tail is confirmed by the study of the volatility distribution of individual companies , for which we find approximately the same exponent .",
    "we also find that the distribution of the volatility scales for a range of time intervals .",
    "we use the detrended fluctuation analysis and the power spectrum to quantify correlations in the volatility of the s&p 500 index and individual company stocks .",
    "we find that the volatility is long - range correlated . both the power spectrum and the dfa methods show two regions characterized by different power law behaviors with a cross - over at approximately 1.5  days .",
    "moreover , the correlations show power - law decay , often observed in numerous phenomena that have a self - similar or `` fractal '' origin .",
    "the scaling property of the volatility distribution , its power - law asymptotic behavior , and the long - range volatility correlations suggest that volatility correlations might be one possible explanation for the observed scaling behavior  @xcite for the distribution of price changes  @xcite .",

    "the direct method to study the correlation property is the autocorrelation function , @xmath103 where @xmath69 is the time lag .",
    "potential difficulties of the correlation function estimation are the following : ( _ i _ ) the correlation function assumes stationarity of the time series . this criterion is not usually satisfied by real - world data .",

    "is the power spectrum analysis .",
    "note that the power spectrum analysis can only be applied to linear and stationary ( or strictly periodic ) time series .",
    "the third method we use to quantify the correlation properties is called _ detrended fluctuation analysis _ ( dfa )  @xcite .",

    "therefore , measuring the self - similar feature can indirectly tell us information about the correlation properties .",
    "the advantages of dfa over conventional methods ( e.g. spectral analysis and hurst analysis ) are that it permits the detection of long - range correlations embedded in a non - stationary time series , and also avoids the spurious detection of apparent long - range correlations that are an artifact of non - stationarities .",
