    "recently , several papers @xcite have appeared discussing the relations between self organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite and usual critical phenomena . some of them @xcite stress the fact that one can reformulate classic critical systems ( namely , directed percolation ) in a way indistinguishable from soc , while others @xcite focus on the role of the control and order parameters .",
    "we started our investigation from the observation  @xcite that one can express the problem of directed site and bond percolation  @xcite in a form reminiscent of the invasion percolation process  @xcite or the bak - sneppen self organized model  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this formulation is that the critical value of the percolation probability does not need to be adjusted carefully , but instead emerges from the probability distribution of a set of continuous variables , while the original model is defined in terms of boolean variables .",
    "the directed percolation problem can be formulated in terms of probabilistic cellular automata ( pca )  @xcite .",
    "pca are very general models that include for instance the kinetic ising model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how any critical pca may be mapped into a soc model .",
    "the mapping is presented constructively in sec .",
    "[ section : fragments ] .",
    "it can also be considered as a multi - site coding technique  @xcite , particularly adapted to probabilistic systems ( where usual multi - site performs badly ) . from a computational point of view",
    ", this algorithm allows a quick determination of phase diagrams and computation of critical properties . in sec .",
    "[ section : examples ] we apply this method to the study of the domany - kinzel model of directed percolation and to the two dimensional ising model .    on the other hand",
    ", the mapping implies that to each pca corresponds a soc model defined in a high or infinite dimensional space .",
    "this correspondence can give some insight in the nature of the soc phase , as addressed in sec .",
    "[ section : soc ] .",
    "we end with some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "we deal with probabilistic cellular automata , i.e. , discrete models defined on a lattice .",
    "let us consider explicitly the one dimensional boolean case .",
    "a configuration at time @xmath0 is obtained from the configuration at time @xmath1 by applying in parallel a probabilistic rule to each site .",
    "the rule is implemented on a computer by comparing ( pseudo ) random numbers with a certain number of fixed parameters ( probabilities ) .",
    "one can think of pca as the evolution of a deterministic discrete system on a random quenched field ( the set of random numbers ) .    for simplicity",
    ", we refer to the directed site percolation problem in 1 + 1 dimensions , where the higher @xmath2 , the higher the probability of percolating . in this case",
    "one can visualize the random field as the height of a corrugated landscape , and @xmath2 as the water level .",
    "there will be percolation if the water is able to percolate on the corrugated landscape , i.e. , if the plane at height @xmath2 is not completely blocked ( in this directed model water is forbidden to back - percolate ) . for each value of @xmath2",
    ", we denote with a one the sites that are wet , and with a zero those that are dry .",
    "one can stack a set of planes , and let them evolve in parallel .",
    "we can read the state of a certain site for all values of @xmath2 as a vector of ones and zeroes , each component being labeled by @xmath2 .    in the initial configuration sites are either wet or dry , independently of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , all vectors are either filled with ones or with zeroes .",
    "going on with the percolation process , a component @xmath2 of the vector at a certain site and time @xmath0 will be wet if there is at least a wet component at the same height among its neighbors at time @xmath1 , and if the height of the random field at that position is less than @xmath2 .",
    "one can easily express this in computer language .",
    "each component corresponds to a bit in a computer word . with words of @xmath3 bits",
    ", @xmath2 can assume the values @xmath4 .",
    "the ( bitwise ) or of the words in the neighborhood gives a one for all values of @xmath2 for which there is at least one wet neighbor .",
    "given a random number @xmath5 in that site , all planes with @xmath6 have the possibility of percolating .",
    "this is expressed in computer terms by taking a word @xmath7 filled with zeroes up to a fraction @xmath5 of bits and then with ones , and performing the and of @xmath7 with the previous word .",
    "iterating this procedure , we get in the last line of the lattice ( say at time @xmath8 ) a set of partially filled words .",
    "if at time @xmath8 a word has the bit number @xmath9 equal to one , this means that for @xmath10 , water would have percolated to that site ( given the set of random numbers )",
    ".    the procedure can be generalized to words of arbitrary length . in the limit @xmath11 , the boolean vectors become the characteristic functions of subsets of the unit interval , that we call fragments .",
    "the manipulation of fragments is not limited to this bitwise implementation , as we shall see in the following .",
    "the fragment expressions do not depend explicitly on the control parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath2 and the critical scaling law of the order parameter are obtained _ a posteriori _",
    ", from the distribution of fragments .",
    "let us now formalize these concepts . for simplicity we refer to the domany - kinzel ( dk ) model  @xcite , which is a simple one dimensional pca .",
    "we denote with @xmath12 the state of a site @xmath13 at time @xmath1 , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the size of the lattice .",
    "we shall simplify @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "all space index operations are modulo @xmath15 ( periodic boundary conditions ) . the evolution rule may be written as @xmath18(x_{-}\\oplus x_{+})\\vee [ r < q]x_{-}x_{+ }   \\label{dk}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 represents the exclusive or operation ( sum modulus two ) , @xmath20 the or operation , and the multiplication ( or @xmath21 ) stands for the and operation , with the usual priority rules .",
    "the control parameters @xmath2 and @xmath22 are fixed , and @xmath23 is a random number uniformly distributed between zero and one , and where @xmath24 $ ] is one if _",
    "logical expression _ is true and zero otherwise  @xcite .    in the case of directed site percolation @xmath25 ,",
    "( [ dk ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath26   ( x_-(p ) \\vee x_+(p ) ) .",
    "\\label{site}\\ ] ] where we emphasize the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath2 .",
    "the fragment approach consists in reading @xmath28 as the value of the characteristic function of the fragment @xmath29 at @xmath2 .",
    "the expression @xmath30 $ ] is the characteristic function of a fragment @xmath31",
    ".    equation  ( [ site ] ) in terms of fragments is @xmath32 that does not depend on @xmath2 . the boolean functions and , or , xor ,",
    "not correspond to the set operations intersection , union , symmetric difference and complement , respectively .",
    "we shall use the same symbol for boolean and set operations .",
    "the initial configuration is independent of @xmath2 , this means that @xmath33 are either the empty set or the unit interval , according with @xmath34 .",
    "applying the set operations we obtain the asymptotic fragments @xmath35 .",
    "for a given value of @xmath2 , @xmath28 is one if the point @xmath2 belongs to the fragment @xmath29 and zero otherwise .",
    "thus we can obtain the asymptotic value of @xmath28 from the asymptotic fragments @xmath29 , that evolved without an explicit dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "if some function of the @xmath36 exhibits a phase transition in correspondence of a critical value @xmath37 , this behavior can be extracted from the asymptotic fragments .",
    "for instance , the density @xmath38 @xmath39 is proportional to the number of fragments the point @xmath2 belongs to , @xmath40.\\ ] ]    the above procedure can be applied to all probabilistic cellular automata .",
    "the practical recipe for the implementation is    * pca : * express the model as a probabilistic cellular automaton whose evolution rule only uses boolean expressions , and convert the control parameters ( @xmath41 ) to expressions like @xmath42 $ ] where @xmath43 appear alone on the right side .",
    "* fragments : * replace the variables @xmath36 with fragments @xmath44 , and substitute @xmath45 $ ] with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 $ ] with its complement @xmath48 ) . the initial configuration @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath49 .    * implementation : * implement the fragments as arrays of bits ( the simplest approach ) or as sparse vectors ( see later ) and iterate the rule .    *",
    "criticality : * the asymptotic distribution of fragments gives the critical properties ( control parameters and exponents ) of the original model .",
    "let us illustrate separately each of the previous points .",
    "the evolution rule is generally expressed by means of transition probabilities .",
    "note , however , that the transition probabilities do not completely characterize the problem for the damage spreading transitions  @xcite , since there are many ways of actually implementing the probabilistic choices in a computer code . the general approach for deriving a boolean expression from transition probabilities is to write formally the future value of the dynamical variable ( the spin ) as a function of the spins in the neighborhood and of the transition probabilities converted to random boolean variables , i.e. , @xmath50 , [ r < p_2 ] , \\dots)$ ] .",
    "then there are several ways  @xcite of expressing a boolean function using a set of standard boolean operations like and , or , xor , not .",
    "clearly , one should spend some effort in reducing the length of the resulting expression .",
    "sometimes ( see the ising model in sec .",
    "[ section : examples ] ) one has to transform from @xmath51 $ ] to something like @xmath52 $ ] ( or more complex expressions ) .",
    "the method can be applied to any number of parameters . in the case of @xmath53 parameters",
    "@xmath54 the fragments are subsets of the @xmath53-dimensional unit hypercube .",
    "for instance , in the general dk model , eq .  ( [ dk ] ) , there are two control parameters ( @xmath2 and @xmath22 ) and the fragments are subset of the unit square . in this way it is possible to draw a sketch of a phase diagram , in just one simulation .    however , if one is interested in crossing the critical surface along one line ( see the computation of critical exponents in sec",
    ".  [ section : criticality ] ) , one has to express the parameters as functions of a single variable , say @xmath55 , and transform the expressions accordingly .",
    "for instance , the directed bond percolation problem corresponds to the curve @xmath56 , which can be expressed as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding expression is @xmath59(x_{-}\\oplus x_{+})\\vee [ 1-\\sqrt{1-r}<s](x_{-}x_{+ } ) \\label{bond}\\ ] ] which gives the following fragment expression @xmath60      the simplest way of implementing a fragment on a computer is by means of an array of @xmath3 bits and using bitwise boolean operations .",
    "generally one uses computer words ( 32 or 64 bits ) for efficiency , but it is possible to use multiple words to increase the sampling frequency of probability . the numerical advantage over other multi - spin approaches @xcite is the use of just one random number for all the @xmath3 simulations . referring to a @xmath2-layer as a cut of the fragment space - time configuration with a given value of @xmath2",
    ", we see that the layers at different @xmath2 are not independent , since they use the same random numbers .",
    "the influence of these correlations is discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : correlations ] .",
    "one can increase the sampling frequency around the region of interest ( for instance the critical region ) by appropriately defining the correspondence of the bits with the values of @xmath2 .",
    "this affects the way @xmath7 is implemented . with the fragment method",
    "it is still possible to perform simulations starting from a single site ( grassberger method ) keeping track of nonzero fragments .",
    "the method is powerful if one uses a small interval around the critical point , so that all clusters for various @xmath2 are similar . when using two parameters ( say @xmath2 and @xmath22 ) one has to implement differently expressions like @xmath30 $ ] ( fill the unit square in the @xmath2 direction from @xmath5 to 1 ) from @xmath61 $ ] ( fill the unit square in the @xmath22 direction from @xmath5 to 1 ) .",
    "the alternative approach in representing fragments consists in keeping track of the starting and ending points of all segments that form a one dimensional fragment .",
    "the approach is very similar to the treatment of sparse matrices , so we call it the sparse fragment method",
    ". the rules of combining sparse fragments are more complex than above .",
    "on the other hand in this way one has infinite precision , which comes useful in finding the critical behavior as explained in the sec .",
    "[ section : correlations ] .    in general",
    "a fragment is formed by just one segment if the evolution rule can be expressed using only and and or , while for instance the xor between two overlapping fragments causes holes . as an example , the site percolation rule eq .",
    "( [ site ] ) can be implemented as sparse fragments by considering the evolution of the lower extremum @xmath62 of the segments @xmath63 $ ] as  @xcite @xmath64    sometimes the problem can be reformulated without xor operations .",
    "for instance , the bond percolation problem  ( [ bond ] ) can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath65 x_{-})\\vee ( [ r_{+}<p ] x_{+ } ) \\label{grassberger : bond}\\ ] ] with two random numbers per site .",
    "the evolution of this rule can be easily implemented using sparse fragments .",
    "[ section : criticality ] the critical properties of the original model are obtained from the asymptotic distribution of fragments .",
    "the fragment method introduces strong correlations among @xmath2-layers as also noted in ref .",
    "one can exploit these correlations considering differences in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "if the patterns for different @xmath2-layers have similar sizes , the fluctuations cancel out .",
    "this happens in general if the rule does not contain xor ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : or ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the xor generally implies strong variations of clusters with @xmath2 , so that the fluctuations can in principle be wider than uncorrelated simulations ( see for instance fig .",
    "[ fig : xor ] ) .",
    "a powerful method for the computation of critical quantities exploits the scaling relation @xmath66 numerically solving it for the unknown @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath37 .",
    "this is an easy task for the sparse fragments approach , since one can obtain @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 for each value of @xmath68 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the bit approach one has to compute the value of the exponents and @xmath37 so to make all data collapse on a single ( smooth ) curve .",
    "this can be performed near @xmath37 approximating the curves with polynomials ( or any other fitting function ) , and minimizing the @xmath72 of the regression .",
    "in this section we show some results of the fragment method applied to classical problems : the determination of the phase diagram and critical properties of the domany - kinzel model , and the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the first example is the one - dimensional directed site percolation , i.e. , the line @xmath73 of the dk model , eq .",
    "( [ site ] ) . a snapshot of part of the asymptotic fragment configuration is shown in fig .  [ fig : or ] , with the plot of the density @xmath74 .",
    "as illustrated above , if one computes the xor dilution ( the line @xmath75 of the dk model , eq .  ( [ dk ] ) ) , the fragments decompose into several segments , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : xor ] .",
    "correspondingly , the integrated density converges slowly to a smooth curve .    the complete phase diagram of the dk model can be obtained in just one simulation by iterating two - dimensional fragments .",
    "the plot of the asymptotic density @xmath76 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dk ] .",
    "it compares well with those obtained with other methods  @xcite . from the convergent behavior of the contour lines , the position @xmath77 of the discontinuous transition for the density",
    "is clearly indicated .",
    "near the corner @xmath78 the surface becomes irregular : this is due to the prevalence of the xor in eq .",
    "( [ dk ] ) .",
    "one can also investigate the chaotic phase of the dk model by iterating two fragment configurations with the same random numbers .",
    "the hamming distance between two replicas with a given value of @xmath2 and @xmath22 is the @xmath79-component of the density of the xor between the two asymptotic fragment configuration . a plot of the resulting hamming distance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkh ] . here",
    "one can notice a trace of the density phase boundary ( near @xmath80 ) , due to the critical slowing down .    for the directed site percolation problem we found @xmath81 for a system of size @xmath82 , in the interval @xmath83 for different values of @xmath84 .",
    "the agreement with previous measurements  @xcite is satisfactory .",
    "moreover , we want to stress that these values were obtained with data coming from simulations of less than 20 minutes of cpu time on a 150 mhz pc running linux  @xcite .    as a second application",
    ", we consider now the kinetic version of an equilibrium system , the two dimensional ising model with heat bath dynamics @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we show how to express the evolution equation of this model as a totalistic pca , and how to translate its evolution in fragment language . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising ] we show the plot of the magnetization @xmath85 with respect to @xmath86 for an ising model with reduced interaction constant @xmath87 .",
    "the transition is well characterized by plotting the second moment ( standard deviation ) of the magnetization as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we found @xmath88 and @xmath89 , in good agreement with the exact values @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have shown how the dk model and the ising model , which are pca with critical behavior , may be mapped into fragment models with no control parameter , that is models that show self organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "it is evident that the fragment method may be applied to any critical pca .",
    "this result is summarized in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ figure : diagram ] .",
    "the state @xmath28 may be obtained by evolving the pca with a given @xmath2 ( labeled by @xmath92 in the diagram ) or by building the fragments @xmath33 and evolving them with the fragment method ( @xmath93 in the diagram ) that does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "finally , by probing @xmath29 with a @xmath2-layer , that is by checking if @xmath29 extends down to @xmath2 , we recover @xmath36 .",
    "although it is easier to think of one dimensional fragments , this result is valid for any number of control parameters .",
    "it is interesting to describe a `` traditional '' soc model with the fragment language , trying to obtain the @xmath2-layer description that would make the soc model correspond to a usual critical model .",
    "let us discuss the one dimensional bak - snappen model  @xcite with nearest neighbors interactions",
    ". in this model one starts from an array of real numbers @xmath94 , @xmath95 uniformly distributed in the unit interval .",
    "one looks for the minimum of @xmath94 and replaces it and its nearest neighbors with newly generated random numbers , again uniformly distributed in the unit interval .",
    "the system auto - organizes so that the distribution of @xmath94 follows a power - law ( with exponent 1 ) , with a non - trivial avalanche distribution .",
    "we define now a parallel version of the previous model ( which is not very efficient from a computational point of view ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we divide the discussion in two parts : the research of the minimum and the actual evolution .",
    "let us visualize the @xmath94 as the lower extremum of segments ( fragments ) @xmath96 , and cut the configuration with a line at height @xmath2 .",
    "the minimum is localized at site @xmath9 for which there is only one intersection .",
    "it can be expressed using a boolean variable @xmath97 ( a kronecker @xmath98 ) @xmath99 assuming that the minimum is unique in the continuous @xmath100 limit .",
    "the fragments @xmath96 at and nearest to the minimum are replaced by segments of random length ( @xmath7 ) @xmath101 where the fragment @xmath102 is completely filled if @xmath103 and completely empty if @xmath104 .",
    "the evolution can be expressed on a @xmath2-layer as @xmath105 { \\oplus}x_i^t).\\ ] ]    similar but more complex expressions can be found for the invasion percolation process .",
    "one can see that in these `` traditional '' soc models there are long range space interactions , and also interactions among @xmath2-layers ( see eq .",
    "( [ min ] ) ) .",
    "we think that the second ingredient is the most important : if one knows how some quantity like the density varies with @xmath2 it is not difficult to imagine a mechanism that automatically reaches the critical point .",
    "it is still to be proved that this is the actual mechanism of soc . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ socsite ] ) shows that there exists space and @xmath2-local mechanisms that can be classified as soc .",
    "the fragment method can be considered both as a recipe for numerical studies of phase diagrams and as a mapping from criticality to self organized criticality . for what concerns the first topic ,",
    "the possibility of having a sketch of the phase diagram without huge computation resources is useful in determining the position of the critical line .",
    "numerical applications of the fragment method will be presented in future work . from the theoretical point of view , we think that the formalism presented in this work allows a clear characterization of the basic properties of self organized models , suggesting analogies between usual critical phenomena and self organized ones .",
