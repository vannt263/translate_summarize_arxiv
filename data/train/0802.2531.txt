    "magnetoelectronics , also known as spintronics , is probably the field with the most rapid growth in materials science bringing to the center of scientific research new phenomena.@xcite for researchers dealing with ab - initio calculations one of the most interesting concept in spintronics is the half - metallicity.@xcite research has been focused initially on the explanation of the origin of the half - metallicity and afterwards on the prediction of new half - metallic materials with potential applications in spintronics devices .",
    "half - metals are hybrids between normal metals and semiconductors : the majority - spin band is crossed by the fermi level as in a normal metal while the fermi level falls within a gap in the minority - spin band as in semiconductors leading to a perfect 100%  spin - polarization at the fermi level,@xcite maximizing the efficiency of magnetoelectronic devices.@xcite de groot and his collaborators in 1983 were the first to predict the existence of half - metallicity in the case of the intermetallic semi - heusler alloy nimnsb,@xcite and the origin of the gap seems to be well understood .",
    "@xcite there exist several ab - initio calculations on nimnsb reproducing the initial results of de groot and collaborators,@xcite and galanakis _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the gap arises from the hybridization between the @xmath1 orbitals of the ni and mn atoms.@xcite moreover in the latter reference it was shown that the total spin moment for the heusler alloys of the nimnsb type follows a slater - pauling behavior being in @xmath2 the total number of valence electrons in the unit cell minus 18 since there are exactly nine occupied minority - spin states.@xcite theoretical calculations for the interfaces of these materials with the semiconductors are few and all results agree that in general the half - metallicity is lost both at the surfaces@xcite and the interfaces with binary semiconductors.@xcite wijs and de groot have argued than in the case of the nimnsb / cds ( 111 ) contacts the sb / s interface keeps half - metallicity when the s atoms sit exactly on top of sb.@xcite moreover taking into account also the reconstruction at the surfaces and interfaces can have an important effect on their properties.@xcite finally we should note that several other aspects of nimnsb have been studied using first - principles calculations like the exchange constants and curie temperatures,@xcite the quasiparticle states@xcite and the dynamical effects,@xcite the defects and doping,@xcite the structural stability,@xcite the effect of spin - orbit coupling,@xcite the fit of model hamiltonians to describe nimnsb,@xcite orbital magnetism,@xcite the pressure and thermal expansion effects,@xcite the temperature effect@xcite and the magneto - optical properties.@xcite    the half - metallic character of nimnsb in single crystals has been well - established experimentally .",
    "infrared absorption@xcite and spin - polarized positron - annihilation@xcite gave a spin - polarization of @xmath0100% at the fermi level .",
    "high quality films of nimnsb have been grown,@xcite but they were found not to reproduce the half - metallic character of the bulk .",
    "values of 58% and 50% for the spin - polarization at the fermi level were obtained by soulen _ _ et al.__@xcite and by mancoff _",
    "et al._,@xcite respectively , and recently zhu _ _ et al.__@xcite found a value of 40% using spin - resolved photoemission measurements on polycrystalline films .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite showed that during the growth of the nimnsb thin films , sb atoms segregate to the surface decreasing the obtained spin - polarization ; they measured a value of @xmath030% at 200k , while at room temperature the net polarization was practically zero .",
    "but when they removed the excess of sb by a flash annealing , they managed to get a nearly stoichiometric ordered alloy surface terminating in mnsb .",
    "inverse photoemission experiments at room temperature revealed that the latter surface shows a spin - polarization of about 67@xmath39% which is significantly higher than all previous values.@xcite there is also experimental evidence that for a temperature of @xmath080 k there is transition from a half metal to a normal ferromagnet,@xcite but these experiments are not yet conclusive .",
    "finally , the effect of stress on the magnetic anisotropy of thin nimnsb films and the role of defects have been explored.@xcite    based on the success of first - principles electronic structure calculations to describe the properties of nimnsb , several authors have predicted new half - metallic heusler alloys crystallizing in the @xmath4 structure of semi - heusler compounds like nicrm and nivm ( m= p , as , sb , s , se and te),@xcite and xcral ( x= fe , co , ni ) and nicrz ( z= al , ga , in).@xcite recently , katayama - yoshida and collaborators published a paper including also ab - initio calculations on nimnsi semi - heusler alloy , which was predicted to have a curie temperature of 1050 k,@xcite exceeding even the 730 k shown by nimnsb.@xcite this finding motivated us to study the electronic and magnetic properties of this compound in detail since except the very high curie temperature , it should be easily grown due to the well - known and well - controlled growth of nimnsb and it should be compatible with si ( si crystallizes in a diamond structure and the unit cell of nimnsi is two times the unit cell of si ) .",
    "we decided to expand our study to cover also the closely - related nicrsi and nivsi alloys .",
    "nivsi was found not to be half - metallic at its equilibrium lattice constant and thus we focused our study on nicrsi and nimnsi alloys . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the details of our calculations and in section [ sec3 ] the electronic and magnetic properties of the bulk phase of these alloys . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the robustness of half - metallicity and ferromagnetism , and in section [ sec5 ] the properties of ( 100 ) surfaces and of their interfaces with the si , gap and zns semiconductors which have an experimental lattice constant almost identical to the theoretical equilibrium lattice constants of nicrsi and nimnsi .",
    "finally in section [ sec6 ] we discuss the effect of defects and disorder and in section [ sec7 ] we summarize and conclude .",

    "the lattice consists of 4 fcc sublattices .",
    "the unit cell in the case of semi - heuslers xyz is that of a fcc lattice with four atoms as basis : x at @xmath7 , y at @xmath8 , a vacant site at @xmath9 and z at @xmath10 in wyckoff coordinates . in the case of full - heusler compounds the vacant site",
    "is also occupied by a x atom . ]",
    "to study the niysi alloys we have employed both the full  potential nonorthogonal local ",
    "orbital minimum  basis band structure scheme ( fplo)@xcite and the full - potential screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( fskkr ) method.@xcite both methods as we will discuss later give similar results for the bulk alloys .",
    "fplo is suitable to study the disorder within the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "fskkr is suitable to study surfaces and interfaces since its screened character and the use of decimation method for the inversion of the green function matrix lead to an order @xmath11 scaling of the cpu time , where @xmath11 is the number of inequivalent atoms in the unit cell .",
    "moreover dyson equation makes possible the study of single impurities within the framework of fskkr in real space.@xcite in both cases we employed the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda)@xcite for the exchange - correlation energy within the framework of the density functional theory.@xcite        semi - heusler alloys ( also known as half - heusler compounds ) crystallize in the @xmath4 structure which consists of four fcc sublattices and have the chemical formula xyz where x a high - valent transition metal atom , y a low - valent transition metal atom and z a @xmath12 atom . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present both the @xmath4 structure of semi - heuslers and the @xmath5 structure of the full - heusler compounds like co@xmath6mnsi .",
    "the unit cell is that of a fcc lattice with four atoms as basis : x atoms occupy the @xmath7 site , y atoms the @xmath8 , the @xmath9 site is vacant for the semi - heuslers and occupied by x in the case of full - heuslers , and finally z atoms occupy the @xmath10 site ( we use wyckoff coordinates to denote the sites ) . the zinc - blende structure adopted by a large number of semiconductors , like gap and zns is also consisting of four fcc sublattices . in the case of gap",
    "the @xmath7 site is occupied by a ga atom , the @xmath8 site by a p atom , while the other two sites are unoccupied .",
    "the diamond structure of si is also coherent with the @xmath4 structure of semi - heusler alloys since double the unit cell gives the zinc - blende structure of binary semiconductors .",
    "this close structure similarity makes the heusler alloys compatible with the existing semiconductor technology and thus very attractive for industrial applications .",
    "since the compounds under study have not been grown experimentally , we have to determine their equilibrium lattice constant . in fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot the fplo calculated total energies vs the lattice constant for all three nivsi , nicrsi and nimnsi .",
    "we have assumed that all three are ferromagnets ( which is confirmed by our calculated exchange constants , at least for nicrsi and nimnsi , in section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "we have scaled the total energy for each compound in a way that the zero of the total energy corresponds to the minimum energy at the theoretical equilibrium lattice constants .",
    "all three compounds have an equilibrium lattice constant very close to 5.4  .",
    "we have decided to use the latter one for all calculations presented in this manuscript .    .",
    "( color online)atom - resolved and total spin magnetic moments in @xmath2 calculated using both the fplo and fskkr methods . in the last two columns we present our results on the curie temperature in kelvin units calculated with both the mean - field ( @xmath13 ) and random - phase ( @xmath14 ) approximations .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we have investigated the case of ni - cr and ni - mn atomic swaps .",
    "these defects have the peculiarity that cr(mn ) and ni atoms move to sites of different symmetry with respect to their perfect sites in the nicrsi and nimnsi alloys . in fig . [ fig13 ]",
    "we present for both compounds the total dos for two different concentrations of atomic swaps ( @xmath15=0.1 and 0.2 ) and the atom - resolved dos for the first case .",
    "the ni and cr(mn ) atoms at the perfect sites show a dos similar to the perfect compounds presented in fig .",
    "the impurity ni atoms at the perfect cr(mn ) sites show a double - peak structure and the fermi level falls within this structure . when the concentration is increased to 0.2 , as it is obvious from the total dos , the two peaks overlap creating a wide - band .",
    "the ni impurity atoms carry a very large spin moment with respect to the spin moment of the ni atoms at the perfect ni site as can be seen in table [ table7 ] where we present the spin magnetic moments for both cr- and mn - alloys and for various concentrations of atomic swaps . as we increase the concentration of atomic swaps the spin moments of both the ni impurity atoms and ni atoms at the perfect sites decrease .",
    "the changes are even more important for the cr(mn ) atoms at the ni sites . due to the different symmetry these atoms have a spin moment antiparallel to the spin moment of the other transition metal atoms reducing considerably the total spin moment and leading to ferrimagnetic alloys .",
    "this behavior is present also in the case of cr and mn impurity atoms at perfect co sites in co@xmath6cral(si ) and co@xmath6mnal(si ) full - heusler alloys,@xcite where cr(mn ) impurity atoms have spin moments antiparallel to the spin magnetic moment of the other transition metal atoms .",
    "but in these full - heusler alloys the half - metallic character is kept contrary to the compounds under study here .",
    "this is due to the ni impurity atoms and not to the cr(mn ) impurity atoms which have a very small dos in the minority - spin band which is obviously a very weak image of the ni - impurity dos . to examine this behavior",
    "even further we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] the dos for a single cr impurity atom at a perfect ni site and for a single ni impurity atom at a perfect cr site in nicrsi . in the case of the cr impurity atom",
    "the gap persists and the spin moment is negative ( in table [ table7 ] we present in parenthesis the spin moment of the single impurity atoms ) and close to the values calculated using the fplo - cpa code . the ni impurity atoms at the cr site show a double peak structure at the fermi level with the @xmath16 states just below the gap and the fermi level being pinned exactly at the minority @xmath17 peak .",
    "thus due to symmetry reasons the majority @xmath1-states of ni - impurity atoms are completely occupied leading to large spin moments and the fermi level falls within a double peak - structure leading to a complete destruction of half - metallicity .",
    "thus any kind of ni defects leads to loss of the half - metallic character .",
    "we have studied using both the full  potential nonorthogonal local  orbital minimum  basis band structure scheme ( fplo ) and the full - potential screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( fskkr ) electronic structure methods the electronic , magnetic and gap - related properties of the niysi compounds and have expanded our study also to cover the case of surfaces , interfaces with semiconductors and defects .",
    "when y stands for v , the ferromagnetism is not very stable due to the weak v - v interactions and these compounds are not suitable for applications .",
    "when y stands for cr or mn , the ferromagnetism is extremely stable leading to very high values of the curie temperature which is predicted to be @xmath0700 k for nicrsi and @xmath01100 k for nimnsi .",
    "both nicrsi and nimnsi are half - metallic at their equilibrium lattice constant with large width of the minority - spin gap ( @xmath01 ev ) and integer values of the total spin moment as predicted by the slater pauling rule .",
    "the gap is created due to the creation of bonding and antibonding @xmath1-hybrids in the minority - spin band .",
    "the width of the gap is marginally affected upon tetragonalization even when we expand or contract the lattice by 5% .",
    "nicrsi ( 001 ) surfaces present a high spin - polarization at the fermi level with respect to the nimnsi alloy due to the large intensity of the cr majority - spin density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level . in the case of interfaces with semiconductors with similar lattice parameter ( gap , zns and si ) ,",
    "ni - based contacts show larger spin - polarization since ni atoms at the interface layer have a more bulk - like environment and in the case of nicrsi interfaces the high cr - dos leads to values of the spin - polarization for the ni - based contacts as high as 90% .",
    "finally , we have shown that there are two kind of defects .",
    "the defects and atomic swaps involving the cr(mn ) and si atoms lead to a broadening of the bands and the gap is slowly shrinking and for a critical value of the defects - concentration it disappears .",
    "ni defects on the other hand lead to a shift of the energy - localized @xmath16 states within the gap and these impurity states completely destroy the half - metallicity .    for realistic applications",
    "it seems that nicrsi is more suitable with respect to both nimnsi studied here and the well - known and widely studied nimnsb heusler alloy .",
    "its curie temperature is smaller than the mn - based alloys but it is still high - enough for applications exceeding considerably the room temperature .",
    "moreover the large population of cr majority - spin states at the fermi level ensures the high - spin polarization at the fermi level which is needed for the injection of current in semiconductors .",
    "crucial for the operation of devices based on heusler alloys is the prevention of the creation of ni defects , since they induce impurity states within the gap which can couple to interface states and completely destroy the spin - polarization of the current injected into the semiconductor .",
