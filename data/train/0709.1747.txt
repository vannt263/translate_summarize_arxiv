    "phase separation and its control have received intense interest , both because of industrial applications  @xcite and the mathematics involved , in particular the cahn  hilliard equation .",
    "this equation was introduced by cahn and hilliard  @xcite to describe phase separation in a binary alloy . since their argument relies on the thermodynamic free energy of mixing ,",
    "the equation is completely general , and describes any two - component system where the mixed state is energetically unfavorable , and where the total amount of matter is conserved .",
    "thus it is used in polymer physics  @xcite , in interfacial flows  @xcite , and in mathematical biology  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss binary liquids , and the order - parameter equation obtained by cahn and hilliard describes the composition of a binary fluid .",
    "a composition @xmath0 indicates a locally well - mixed state , while a composition @xmath1 indicates a local abundance of one binary fluid component over another . in the context of binary fluids , it is important to study the influence of stirring on the two fluid components , and we therefore introduce an advection term into the equation .    the time evolution of the non - advected equation has been studied extensively . in particular , there is a proof concerning the existence and uniqueness of solutions  @xcite .",
    "given an initial state comprising a small perturbation around the unstable , well - mixed state @xmath2 , the system forms domains of unmixed fluid that expand or coarsen in time as @xmath3 , the lifshitz ",
    "slyozov law  @xcite . in many applications ,",
    "the coarsening tendency of the cahn ",
    "hilliard fluid is undesirable , and this can be overcome by fluid advection , which is either passive or active . in the active case  @xcite , the composition gradients induce a backreaction on the flow , while in the passive case , the composition and its gradients exert no effect on the flow  @xcite , and it is this case that we consider in the present paper . if the flow contains large differential shears , the coarsening is either arrested , so that domains grow only to a certain size  @xcite , or can be overwhelmed entirely , so that the mixed state , previously unstable , is now favored  @xcite .",
    "this homogenization is useful in applications , for example in the fabrication of emulsion paints  @xcite .",
    "stirring provides one means of controlling phase separation .",
    "indeed , it is well known that a unidirectional shear flow produces banded domains , with domains aligned in the shear direction  @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms have been employed to control the phase separation , including dipole interactions  @xcite , patterned substrates  @xcite , and surface forcing  @xcite . in  @xcite ,  nraigh and thiffeault study binary mixtures in thin films , and use the backreaction , together with surface forcing , to align the domains in a direction that depends on the forcing parameters . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on phase separation in the presence of advection and a spatially - varying persistent source .",
    "this source can be maintained in several ways . in  @xcite the spatial source",
    "is produced by thermal diffusion , through the ludwig  soret effect  @xcite , in which composition gradients are induced by imposed temperature gradients .",
    "one can also produce composition gradients simply by injecting matter into the system  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall restrict our attention to the symmetric binary fluid , in which equal amounts of both fluid components are present .",
    "this special case involves a wide range of phenomena  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we shall refer to the combination of stirring ( advection ) and the spatial source as ` forcing . '",
    "we have mentioned the often undesirable coarsening tendency of the binary fluid , and the efforts made to suppress it . in this paper",
    "we introduce a quantitative measure of coarsening suppression by studying the @xmath4 power - mean fluctuation of the composition about its average value . by fluctuations about the average value , we mean spatial fluctuations around the ( constant ) average spatial composition , which we then average over space and time . in effect",
    ", we study the time - averaged @xmath5 norm of the composition .",
    "if this quantity is small , the average deviation of the system about the well - mixed state @xmath2 is small , and we therefore use this quantity as a proxy for the level of mixedness of the fluid .",
    "an approach similar to this has already been taken for miscible fluids  @xcite .",
    "there , the equation of interest is the advection - diffusion equation , and fluctuations about the mean are measured by the variance or centred second power - mean of the fluid concentration  @xcite .",
    "the variance is reduced by stirring . by specifying a source term",
    ", it is possible to state the maximum amount by which a given flow can reduce the variance , and hence mix the fluid . by quantifying the variance reduction , one can classify flows according to how effective they are at mixing . just as the linearity of the advection - diffusion equation suggests the variance as a natural way of measuring fluctuations in the concentration ,",
    "the non - linearity of the cahn  hilliard equation and its associated free energy ( cubic and quartic in the composition , respectively ) , will fix our attention on the fourth power - mean of the composition fluctuations .",
    "owing to hlder s inequality , a binary liquid that is well - mixed in this sense will also be well - mixed in the variance sense .",
    "the advantage we gain in considering the fourth power - mean is the derivation of explicit bounds on our measure of mixedness which have manifest flow- and source - dependence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model equations and discuss their nondimensionalization .",
    "we introduce measures of composition fluctuations and their relation to fluid mixing .",
    "these measures of composition fluctuations are based on long - time averages obtained from the composition of the binary fluid . therefore , in sec .",
    "[ sec : existence ] we prove the existence of these long - time averages and find upper bounds on the measures of composition fluctuations . since we are interested in minimizing composition fluctuations , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lower_bds ] we obtain lower bounds on these measures . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] we investigate the parametric dependence of the upper and lower bounds for statistical , homogeneous , isotropic turbulence . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we compare the theoretical bounds with numerical simulations for two standard flows : the constant flow , and the sine flow . in the numerical simulations , we find that the composition fluctuations are indeed bounded by the theoretical limits we have obtained , and the results are dramatically different from those obtained for miscible liquids .",
    "in this section , we introduce the advective cahn  hilliard equation with sources and discuss its properties .",
    "we outline the tools and notation we shall use to analyze composition fluctuations . for generality , the discussion takes place against the backdrop of scalar and vector fields in @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the composition , that is , the scalar field @xmath8 measures phase separation , with @xmath0 indicating a locally well - mixed state , and @xmath1 indicating a local excess of one binary fluid component relative to the other .",
    "let @xmath9 be an externally imposed @xmath10-dimensional incompressible flow , @xmath11 , and let @xmath12 be a distribution of sources and sinks of binary fluid .",
    "the advective cahn ",
    "hilliard ( ach ) equation describes the phase - separation dynamics of the scalar field @xmath13 in the presence of flow , for prescribed sources and sinks , is @xmath14 here @xmath15 is cahn  hilliard diffusion coefficient and @xmath16 is the typical thickness of transition zones between phase - separated regions of the binary fluid .",
    "the finite thickness of these zones prevents the formation of infinite gradients in the problem .",
    "the equation is a passive advection equation : neither the composition nor its gradients affect the flow .    in this paper we work with a nondimensionalization of eq .   that leaves three control parameters in the problem .",
    "therefore , we can unambiguously study limits where control parameters tend to zero or infinity .",
    "let @xmath17 be a timescale associated with the velocity @xmath9 , and let @xmath18 be the magnitude of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the magnitude of the source variations and , finally , let @xmath20 be a lengthscale in the problem ; for example , if the problem is solved in a cube with periodic boundary conditions , we take the lengthscale @xmath20 to be the cube length .",
    "it is then possible to write down eq .   using a nondimensional time @xmath21 and a nondimensional spatial variable @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are dimensionless shape functions , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and where @xmath29 .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is identified with  @xmath30 , the ratio of the velocity timescale to the diffusion timescale . following standard practice , we shall now work with the dimensionless version of the equation , and omit the prime notation .",
    "for ease of notation , we shall henceforth take @xmath31 to mean @xmath32 .",

    "the free energy satisfies the evolution equation @xmath41 and decays in time in the absence of sources and stirring .    to study the spatial fluctuations in composition , we consider the power - means of the quantity @xmath42 , @xmath43 for a symmetric mixture in which @xmath44 , this is simply @xmath45 where we have introduced the @xmath5 norm of the composition , @xmath46 .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is a measure of the magnitude of spatial fluctuations in the composition about the mean , at a given time . since we are interested in the ultimate state of the system , we study the long - time average of composition fluctuations .",
    "we therefore focus on the power - mean fluctuations @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the long - time average @xmath50 provided the limit exists .",

    "these domains are aligned with variations in the source .",
    "a steady - state is reached and @xmath64 attains a constant value , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : no_flow ] .",
    "on the other hand , for small source amplitudes , we have verified that that the domains do not align with the source , and their growth does not saturate .",
    "we do not consider this case here , since we are interested in sources that qualitatively alter the phase separation .",
    "these different regimes are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we consider the case with flow by varying @xmath18 , and find results that are similar to those found in  @xcite , for the same stirring mechanism without sources .",
    "for all values of @xmath18 , the composition reaches a steady state , in which @xmath213 , the pre - averaged form of @xmath64 , fluctuates around a constant value . for small values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the domain growth is arrested due to a balance between the advection and phase - separation terms in the equation , while for moderate values of @xmath18 , the domains are broken up and a mixed state is obtained . at large values of @xmath18 , the @xmath64 measure of composition fluctuations",
    "saturates : further increases in @xmath18 do not produce further decreases in @xmath64 . at these large values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the source structure is visible in snapshots of the composition , as evidenced by fig .",
    "[ fig : c_flow ] .",
    "we investigate the dependence of composition fluctuations on the stirring strength @xmath18 , and show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : min_max_sineflow ] . the theoretical upper and lower bounds on @xmath64 depend on @xmath18 and are obtained as as roots of eqs .   and  .",

    "the numerical values of @xmath64 are indeed bounded by these limiting values , although the @xmath18-dependence is not a power law . instead , the function @xmath215    is a non - increasing function , with a sharp drop occurring in a small range of @xmath18-values .",
    "thus , the fluid becomes more homogeneous with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss the effect of stirring on the inhomogeneity of the fluid by introducing the notion of mixing enhancement .",
    "we measure the ability of a given stirring protocol to suppress composition fluctuations by the mixing enhancement .",
    "similar ideas are often applied to the advection - diffusion equation  @xcite .",
    "we define the dimensionless mixing enhancement @xmath216 for a given flow , the number @xmath217 quantifies the flow s ability to suppress composition fluctuations . in a well - mixed flow ,",
    "the local deviation of @xmath8 away from the mean will be small ; a small @xmath55-value is a signature of a well - mixed flow .",
    "we are therefore justified in calling @xmath217 the mixing enhancement .",
    "we obtain some control over the mixing enhancement @xmath218 from the inequalities of secs .",
    "[ sec : existence ] and  [ sec : lower_bds ] .",
    "based on these inequalities , the mixing enhancement is bounded above and below , @xmath219 we have plotted the upper and lower bounds on the mixing enhancement for the case of monochromatic sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : min_max_sineflow](b ) .",
    "the maximum enhancement    always exceeds unity in this case , which implies the possibility of finding stirring protocols that homogenize the fluid . on the other hand , the minimum enhancement is less than unity , which indicates the possibility of finding stirring protocols that actually amplify composition fluctuations , and this amplification depends weakly on the maximum rate - of - strain @xmath135 .",
    "this latter case is not surprising , given that a uniform shear flow causes the domains of the cahn ",
    "hilliard fluid to align , rather than to break up .",
    "the sine - flow enhancement is a non - decreasing function of the stirring parameter @xmath18 . at small values of @xmath18 ,",
    "small increases in the vigor of stirring lead to small small increases in the mixing enhancement .",
    "there is a window of intermediate @xmath18-values for which the mixing enhancement increases sharply with increasing @xmath18 . at higher values of @xmath18 , the efficiency saturates , so that further increases in the vigor of stirring have no effect on composition fluctuations .",
    "the saturation is due to finite - size effects : the sine flow wraps filaments of fluid around the torus as in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_flow](c ) .",
    "we study the flow @xmath220 , where @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "we choose a nondimensionalization that is set by the diffusion time @xmath221 , and obtain the following parametric version of eq .",

    "we immediately drop the primes from eq .  .",
    "we fix @xmath225 and @xmath19 and vary the flow strength @xmath18 .",
    "this flow does not satisfy the time - correlation relations  , although the maximum rate - of - strain has the simple form @xmath226 . using this information , and the test function @xmath227 , the    upper and lower bounds obtained in eqs .   and   are independent of the flow strength .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "numerically for various values of @xmath18 and present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_const_flow ] . for small @xmath18 ,",
    "the composition morphology is similar to the flowless case seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : no_flow](d ) , except now the domains are uniformly advected in a direction perpendicular to the source variation . the small-@xmath18 case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_const_flow](a ) . as @xmath18 increases , the domain boundaries are distorted due to the advection , while for large @xmath18 , the advection is sufficiently strong to break up the laminar domains .",
    "the domain - like structure persists at late times however , and narrower laminar domains form .",
    "the @xmath64 measure of mixedness is almost constant across the range of stirring parameters @xmath228 . for @xmath229 ,",
    "@xmath64 is slightly smaller than its value at @xmath204 , due to the presence of more interfaces .",
    "this difference is small however , and increasing @xmath18 does little to mix the fluid .",
    "this is not surprising , given that local shears are necessary to break up domain structures  @xcite , and that such shears are absent from constant flows .",
    "what this example shows however , is the difference between a miscible mixture , and a phase - separating mixture . for a diffusive mixture with the sinusoidal source we have studied",
    ", the constant flow discussed here is optimal for mixing  @xcite ; for a phase - separating mixture , the constant flow badly fails to homogenize the mixture .",

    "hilliard equation with a mean - zero driving term as a way of describing a stirred , phase - separating fluid , in the presence of sources and sinks . by specializing to symmetric mixtures",
    ", we have studied a more tractable problem , although one with many applications .",
    "our goal was to investigate stirring protocols numerically and analytically , and to determine the best way to break up the domains in the cahn ",
    "hilliard fluid and achieve homogenization .",
    "to this end , we introduced the @xmath55 measure of composition fluctuations . since in a well - mixed fluid ,",
    "the composition exhibits spatial fluctuations about the mean , with better mixing leading to smaller fluctuations , we used @xmath55 as a measure of mixedness or homogeneity .",
    "we proved the existence of @xmath55 for long times , for @xmath58 , and obtained _ a priori _ upper and lower bounds on @xmath64 , as an explicit function of the imposed flow @xmath9 , and the source @xmath12 .",
    "we compared the level homogeneity achieved by the random - phase sine flow and the constant flow with the lower bound , and found that the sine flow is effective at homogenizing the binary fluid , while the constant flow fails in this task .",
    "this is not surprising , since it is known that differential shears are needed to break up binary fluid domains , although it is radically different from the advection - diffusion case , where the constant flow was the optimal mixer",
