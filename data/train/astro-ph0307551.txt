    "mkn  231 is one of the best studied ulirg and one of the most luminous object in the local universe .",
    "although the nature of the primary energy source of ulirgs ( agn vs. starburst activity ) still remains rather enigmatic ( see @xcite and reference therein ) , in the case of mkn  231 optical and near infrared observations seem to suggest that a significant contribution to the infrared luminosity could be ascribed to agn activity @xcite .",
    "moreover mkn  231 is also classified as a broad absorption line ( bal ) qso @xcite . on the other hand",
    "this galaxy is also undergoing an energetic starburst .",
    "this strong starburst activity combined with the luminous agn makes mkn  231 one of the best example of the transition from starburst to agn according to the scheme outlined in @xcite .",
    "the presence of absorption possibly associated with the bal outflows combined with the strong starburst activity , makes the x - ray continuum of mkn  231 particularly complex .",
    "rosat , asca and _ chandra _ ( @xcite ) observations have shown this complexity revealing both an extended soft x - ray emission ( associated to the starburst activity ) and a hard x - ray emission indicative of a heavily obscured agn .",
    "the models proposed to explain the flat x - ray spectra of mkn  231 accumulated so far ( which were limited to e@xmath310 kev ) , invoke reprocessed emission : thus the estimate of the intrinsic power of the agn can be obtained only through indirect arguments .",
    "mkn  231 was targeted by xmm-_newton _ on july 6th , 2001 and by _ _",
    "beppo__sax @xcite from december 29th 2001 to january 1st 2002 ( see table 1 ) . for the scientific analysis of the _",
    "_ beppo__sax observation only the data collected from the mecs and from the pds have been considered .",
    "the xmm-_newton _ epic data have been filtered from high background time intervals and only events corresponding to pattern 0 - 12 for mos and pattern 0 - 4 for pn have been used .",
    ".exposure and count rates [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the 0.550 kev spectrum of mkn  231 is particularly complex with both the signatures of the powerful starburst and of a heavily obscured agn ; a more detailed discussion of the spectral modeling is reported in @xcite . +",
    "the 210 kev spectrum confirms that mkn  231 is characterized by : a weak fe emission line ( @xmath4 ev ) and a very hard x - ray emission ( @xmath5 if a single power law ( pl ) model is fitted ) with observed 210 kev luminosity of @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "this latter is a factor 50 lower than what expected from the bolometric luminosity .",
    "all these observational evidences suggest that in the 210 kev bandpass we are seeing only reprocessed emission ( through reflection or scattering on a compton thick mirror ) .    the agn emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) can be decomposed in :    * a transmitted pl which emerges above 10 kev ( component a in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and is filtered by a high column density screen ( @xmath8 @xmath1 ) ; * a reprocessed ( through scattering or reflection ) pl continuum , which dominates the emission in the 210 kev range ( component b ) .",
    "this reprocessed emission is also absorbed ( @xmath9 @xmath1 ) ; * a fe k@xmath10 emission line ( @xmath11 kev , @xmath12 ev ; component d ) .",
    "the 210 kev continuum and the weak fe emission line could be explained with reflection from slightly ionized material or assuming that we see the agn mainly through scattered emission ( see @xcite modeling of the _ chandra _ data ) . in the latter scenario",
    "we assume that the fe emission line is produced by transmission and is diluted from the scattered component .",
    "+ it is worth noticing that , regardless of the possible models assumed for the hard x - ray emission ( scattering or reflection ) , we always found a soft ( 0.52 kev ) x - ray component associated with the starburst activity ( @xmath13erg s@xmath7 ) .",
    "furthermore in the proposed models another pl component is required to account for the 210 kev emission of mkn  231 ( @xmath14erg s@xmath7 ) ; this latter component could be identified with the hard x - ray emission from a population of high mass x - ray binaries ( component c in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , which are expected to be copious in a strong starburst source like mkn 231 .",
    "the main result reported here is that a highly absorbed ( n@xmath15 @xmath16 ) agn component having an intrinsic 210 kev luminosity @xmath17erg / s has been detected ( the error on this estimate refers to the range of luminosities derived with the two models considered ) .",
    "* this is the first direct measurement of the intrinsic power of the agn hosted by mkn  231 . *",
    "+ this luminosity is about a factor 50 less than the infrared luminosity .",
    "thus , the total fir luminosity of the system can not be entirely associated with the agn , even assuming an agn uv luminosity a factor 10 greater than the x - ray luminosity ( as observed in qsos ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this suggest that the bulk fir emission may be due to the starburst , in agreement with the results obtained modeling of the 11000 @xmath18 spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "these observations give also some suggestions on the physical status of the material surrounding the active nucleus in mkn 231 .",
    "we identify the absorber which scatters or reflects the primary emission , with the bal outflows which originate close to the central source .",
    "in particular the ionized mirror could be the inner part of this outflows ( i.e. the `` shielding gas '' proposed by @xcite ) . in both models proposed for the agn emission ,",
    "the scattered / reflected components are absorbed .",
    "this latter absorbing medium could be identified with the starburst regions ( see e.g. @xcite ) or with a different line of sight through the bal wind .",
