    "this is one of the most important issues in modern physics .",
    "approaches to account for the late time cosmic acceleration fall into two representative categories : one is to introduce `` dark energy '' in the right - hand side of the einstein equation in the framework of general relativity ( for a review on dark energy , see  @xcite ) .",

    "in particular , we study the equation of state ( @xmath0 ) and energy density ( @xmath8 ) for dark energy .",
    "the recent cosmological observational data  @xcite seems to imply a dynamical dark energy of equation of state with the crossing of the phantom divide line @xmath9 from the non - phantom phase to phantom phase as the redshift @xmath10 decreases in the near past .",
    "however , we illustrate that the universe with the exponential @xmath1 theory always stays in the non - phantom ( quintessence ) phase or the phantom one , and hence the crossing of the phantom divide can not be realized  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention that such an exponential type as @xmath5 gravity models has been investigated in refs .",
    "we also present a logarithmic @xmath1 theory and show that it has a similar feature as the exponential one .",
    "our motivation in this paper is to build up a realistic @xmath1 theory in which the same behavior of the crossing of the phantom divide as indicated by the data can be achieved .",
    "for this purpose , we will construct a combined @xmath1 theory with both logarithmic and exponential terms .",
    "furthermore , we examine the observational constraints on the combined @xmath1 theory by using the recent observational data of sne ia , bao and cmb .",
