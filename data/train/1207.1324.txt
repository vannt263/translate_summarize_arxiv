    "in 2010 , the d  collaboration reported an anomalously large cp - violating like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in the @xmath6 system @xcite , which was strengthened by the updated measurement @xcite .",
    "the weighted average with the older cdf results @xcite gives a_sl^b = -(74.1 19.3 ) 10 ^ -4 , [ absl ] which is a @xmath7 deviation from the standard model ( sm ) prediction @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the measured dimuon charge asymmetry is a linear combination of the semileptonic asymmetries @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors , respectively .",
    "therefore , the new physics ( np ) may contribute through either of these two sectors . however , since a^q_sl = _ q^sl ( q = d , s ) , where @xmath11 is the width difference in the @xmath12-@xmath13 system and @xmath14 is the cp - violating phase in the semileptonic decays , an enhancement in @xmath15 is necessarily accompanied by an enhancement in @xmath16 and/or in @xmath11 . in the @xmath1 sector , since @xmath17 in the sm already",
    ", a further large enhancement would amount to fine - tuning .",
    "also , an enhancement in @xmath18 would imply the np contribution of a few percent to the branching ratios of decay modes common to @xmath1 and @xmath19 , which is ruled out by the measurements of such modes @xcite . in the @xmath2 sector on the other hand , @xmath20 in the sm @xcite , and the branching ratios of some of the decay modes , notably of @xmath21 ,",
    "have not yet been strongly constrained .",
    "therefore np that contributes to @xmath21 would be a prime candidate to account for the dilepton anomaly @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the only effective four - fermi operators that can account for such an enhanced @xmath22 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , investigate how large the branching ratio @xmath25 can be .    since the desired np is expected to contribute to @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    "decays to different extents , it may lead to a difference in the lifetimes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is otherwise expected to be @xmath26 in the sm @xcite .",
    "the recent lhcb measurements @xcite yield @xmath27 .",
    "this indicates that at the @xmath28 level , the branching ratio @xmath29 up to @xmath30 is still allowed , even if there is no np contribution to @xmath1 decays .",
    "if np contributes to @xmath1 decays , this bound will be further relaxed .",
    "note that this would be a large enhancement : the value of this branching ratio in the sm is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "measurements from other modes of the form @xmath32 , like @xmath33 and @xmath34 , can restrict the np contribution to @xmath21 since they involve the same effective four - fermi operator .",
    "however the experimental information on such decay modes is very poor .",
    "the only direct bound available at present is the 90% babar limit of @xcite ( b^+ k^+ ^+ ^-)|_q^2 > 14.23 gev^2",
    "< 0.33 % . it was suggested in @xcite that a dedicated experimental analysis of the lep data using the missing energy spectrum as in @xcite could be used to constrain @xmath35 and @xmath36 to 5% ; however such an analysis has not been performed to our knowledge .",
    "the bound on @xmath35 obtained in @xcite also weakens considerably when the theoretical uncertainties in @xmath37 are taken into account .",
    "the charm counting in @xmath1 decays yields @xmath38 at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this would give @xmath39 , by subtracting the sm contribution of 1.5% to charmless @xmath6 decays @xcite .",
    "the compatibility between these bounds and a large @xmath25 needs to be investigated in a model - independent framework as well as in the context of specific models , which we shall do in this paper .    the models with scalar leptoquarks @xcite and with flavor - dependent @xmath5 couplings @xcite have been proposed in the literature in order to enhance the @xmath32 decay rates , to account for the dimuon anomaly as well as the measurements of width difference in the @xmath2-@xmath4 system and the cp - violating phase @xmath40 .",
    "we explore the two models above to check whether they are still able to account for all the data , at the same time allowing for an enhanced dimuon asymmetry .",
    "the np that contributes to the decay modes @xmath32 directly influences @xmath2-@xmath4 mixing , by contributing to the dispersive ( @xmath41 ) as well as absorptive ( @xmath42 ) part of the effective hamiltonian for this mixing .",
    "these contributions may result in an enhanced value of the lifetime difference @xmath43 and the cp - violating phase @xmath44 $ ] and , hence , will be restricted by the recent measurements of @xmath45 at the lhcb @xcite . in this section , we shall explore what the data have to say about the np contributions to @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     a @xmath46 fit in the @xmath47,|\\rm h_{\\rm lq}|$ ] ) parameter space , using the constraints on @xmath48 @xcite in addition to those on @xmath43 and @xmath49 mentioned above , yields the maximum value of @xmath50 to be only around 0.05 ( for @xmath51 = 250 gev at 95% c.l . ) .",
    "this gives @xmath52(@xmath21 ) @xmath53 . a leptoquark model ,",
    "thus , can not raise to @xmath25 to the level of a percent .",
    "it is , therefore , also not enough to explain the dimuon anomaly .",
    "in fact , we have checked that if @xmath22 is included in the fit , then the @xmath54 even for very low values of leptoquark mass .",
    "this means that the lq model can not do better than the sm as far as the explanation of the dimuon anomaly is concerned .",
    "in this section we consider a flavor - changing @xmath55 @xcite gauge boson and examine whether it can offer an explanation of the dimuon anomaly while still being consistent with the recent lhcb data .",
    "we consider the lagrangian density _",
    "z^ ( r^sb[|s _ p_l b ] z^ + h.c . ) + r^ [ | _ p_l ] z^. note that @xmath48 gets tree - level @xmath55 contribution from @xmath56 and is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "this restricts the value of @xmath58 to be very small . on the other hand , @xmath42 is sensitive to the combination of couplings @xmath59 , and we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ m12g12 ] that a large value of @xmath60 is required for a solution of the dimuon anomaly .",
    "this means that a large value of @xmath61 will be needed in the @xmath55 model . with a small @xmath58",
    ", this could imply a very large value of @xmath62 , where the calculations would become nonperturbative and , hence , unreliable .",
    "the situation would become worse with increasing values of @xmath55 mass .",
    "therefore we have to stay away from the nonperturbative region .",
    "lower experimental bounds on the @xmath5 mass can be a serious problem .",
    "direct searches of pair production of @xmath63 at the tevatron have provided a lower bound on the @xmath5 mass to be 399 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "however since this bound assumes sm - like couplings of @xmath5 to all quarks , it can be bypassed if the @xmath5 is assumed to couple very weakly ( or not at all ) to the first - generation quarks .",
    "this allows us to consider a very light @xmath5 , with mass as low as @xmath64 gev .",
    "note that since @xmath65 , the decay width of @xmath5 can affect the results ( at large couplings , the width may be as large as a few gev ) and has been taken into account in our calculations .",
    "note that , in principle , bounds on the effective coupling in @xmath66 as obtained in @xcite can put correlated constraints on @xmath62 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , the fit therein assumes a small imaginary part of the effective coupling , while the one - loop correction @xcite to @xmath66 through a @xmath5 exchange has a large imaginary part for small @xmath67 .",
    "the constraints in @xcite are , therefore , not applicable in our case . a further analysis of @xmath66 , allowing for an imaginary contribution to the effective coupling , may yield stronger constraints .    in fig .",
    "[ zp1 ] we show the predictions of the @xmath5 model in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 planes for some sample values of the couplings for illustration .",
    "( note that @xmath70 @xcite . )",
    "the figure shows that there are values of the couplings that can be consistent with the @xmath71 data as well as the dimuon asymmetry data to within @xmath28 .",
    "the values of @xmath25 in these allowed regions can be as high as @xmath72 20% .",
    "however , constraints from the measurements of @xmath73 , @xmath35 and @xmath74 still continue to apply . in the case of a specific model such as this",
    ", the constraints would be more severe than those in sec .",
    "[ eff : th ] since the effective couplings ( @xmath75 ) are now related to each other .",
    "model with sample values of the couplings in the @xmath76 plane overlaid with the constraints from @xmath45 .",
    "the lower panel shows the corresponding predictions in the ( @xmath77 ) plane overlaid with the experimental constraints from @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we have used @xmath80 gev .",
    "[ zp1 ] ]    figure  [ zp2 ] shows the result of a @xmath46 fit in the @xmath81 plane using all the experimental data : @xmath48 , @xmath43 , @xmath22,seem consistent with all data to within @xmath28 , the results are reliable only when the couplings are perturbative , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "we indicate this value of @xmath83 by a horizontal line in the figure , and consider only the region below this line as the valid one .",
    "( the region below the line but very close to it may still have significant higher - order corrections . )",
    "plane for @xmath84 gev .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to @xmath85 .",
    "contours corresponding to @xmath25 values of 3.5% , 7% , 12% , and 20% are also shown .",
    "[ zp2 ] ]    even by demanding perturbative couplings in addition to @xmath86 ( i.e. @xmath28 level ) , the branching ratio @xmath25 can be as high as @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the @xmath88 , and @xmath22 data by itself can not put strong constraints on the value of this branching ratio .",
    "the strongest constraints here come from @xmath73 and @xmath74 . taking into account these constraints",
    ", the value of @xmath36 can be as high as 5% .",
    "this can happen , for example , with @xmath89 , @xmath90 , which makes @xmath35 @xmath91 1.5% and @xmath74 @xmath91 0.35% , the former allowing a relaxation of the constraint from @xmath73 .    note that this value of @xmath25 can alleviate the dimuon anomaly ( from @xmath92 for the sm , to @xmath93 ) ; however , it is not enough to explain it .",
    "some contribution from np in the @xmath94 mixing may also be needed , as was recently conjectured in @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the possible enhancement of @xmath25 that may help explain the observed anomalous like - sign dimuon asymmetry . taking into account the constraints from the lifetime ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , as well as the measurements of related @xmath95 decay modes , we find that an enhancement up to @xmath96 is allowed at @xmath28 .",
    "this bound may decrease with further constraints on @xmath35 .    within the context of specific models , an enhancement of @xmath36 to more than 0.3%",
    "is not possible with the leptoquark model , but the model with a light flavor - changing @xmath5 that does not couple to light quarks can increase it to 5% .",
    "this helps alleviate the @xmath22 anomaly to some extent , but can not account for it entirely , and contribution from np in the @xmath1 sector may be needed .",
    "our results with leptoquarks are similar to those in @xcite , however the updated lhcb data used by us has made the constraints on leptoquark parameters even stronger . on the other hand , the light @xmath5 employed by us allows much larger values of the branching ratio than that predicted therein .",
    "accounting for the dimuon anomaly to within @xmath97 , as indicated in @xcite , is not possible even with a light @xmath5 , because of the new stronger lhcb constraints and the requirement of perturbative couplings .",
    "if @xmath36 is at the percent level , it will soon be within the reach of experiments , and could play an important role in our understanding of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the direct measurement of this branching ratio should , hence , be a high - priority .",
