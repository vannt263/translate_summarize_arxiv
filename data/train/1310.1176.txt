    "strong interaction is governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) of quarks and gluons . because of the color confinement , the low - energy spectrum of qcd consists of plenty of color - singlet hadrons . in the traditional picture of naive constituent quark models ,",
    "the mesons are described as the quark ",
    "antiquark pair @xmath0 and its internal excitations , and the baryons as the three - quark configuration @xmath1 with its excitations .",
    "recent developments in the high - energy experimental facilities ( belle , babar , cleo , besiii , lhcb , etc . )",
    "identify a bunch of new hadrons , especially in the heavy ( charm and bottom ) quark sector.@xcite at the same time , the accumulation of the precise data in the low - energy exclusive measurements ( leps , clas , hades , cosy , etc . )",
    "reveals the new aspects of the light ( up , down and strange ) hadrons , such as the @xmath2 resonance.@xcite these activities clearly establish the existence of the hadrons which do not fit well in the predictions of the conventional picture .",
    "these are called exotic hadrons .    in order to explain the extraordinary nature of the exotic hadrons ,",
    "many kinds of new configurations have been proposed for the internal structure of the exotic hadrons .",
    "typical configurations can be classified into three categories as follows .",
    "_ multi - quark hadrons _ : hadrons with four or more valence quarks , e.g. the mesons made of four quarks ( tetraquarks , @xmath3 and the baryons made of five quarks ( pentaquarks , @xmath4.@xcite    _ hadronic molecules _ : loosely - bound two or more hadron systems , e.g. the mesons with the meson  meson molecular structure and the baryons with the meson  baryon molecular structure.@xcite    _ gluonic hybrid _ : the hadrons with the valence gluon component , e.g. @xmath5 , @xmath6 ,  , or the mesons entirely made by gluons ( glueball , @xmath7).@xcite    as far as the color confinement is concerned , all these states are allowed to exist ( with appropriate color configurations to form the singlet in total ) .",
    "moreover , because the exotic hadrons are usually found in the excited spectrum , it is natural to expect the creation of @xmath8 pairs , gluons and virtual mesons as an excitation mode on top of the ground states .",
    "thus , the exotic hadrons are expected to manifest the new forms of the hadrons , and hence the study of them helps us to learn how the hadrons are constructed from the highly nontrivial dynamics of the strong interaction . in this way , the study of the hadron structure deserves a good testing ground for the low - energy nonperturbative dynamics of qcd .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we try to clarify the hadron structure , we will encounter some subtle issues in the discussion .",
    "for instance , how can we distinguish the four - quark state from the meson  meson molecule ? what is the wave function of an exotic hadron with a finite decay width ?",
    "in literature , these difficulties have been realized ( although sometimes they are disregarded for simplicity ) , but there is no broad consensus for the proper measure of the hadron structure .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a general classification scheme , which does not rely upon the specific models .",
    "this is the issue we would like to address in this paper .    in the following ,",
    "we first summarize the subtleties of the definition of the hadron structure in some detail , and try to establish an appropriate strategy for this problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : strategy ] . based on this strategy",
    ", we discuss the structure of stable bound states from the viewpoint of the compositeness of the hadrons in sections  [ sec : bound ] and [ sec : resonance ] . for a stable bound state ,",
    "the compositeness is well - defined and normalized .",
    "moreover , for a weakly bound state , the compositeness can be related to the experimental observables in a model - independent manner .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to generalize this approach to resonances .",
    "we show recent efforts of the application of the compositeness to resonances in sec .",
    "[ sec : resonance ] . in sec .  [ sec : other ] , we briefly introduce other approaches to the hadron structure , which are complementary to the compositeness approach .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary .",
    "we discuss the subtleties and difficulties in the discussion of the structure of hadrons . some of them are well known , but others are not thoroughly considered in literature . examining these difficulties",
    ", we would like to establish the conditions for the desirable formulation of the hadron structure .",
    "we have introduced several different configurations for the description of the exotic hadrons .",
    "naively , one may ask whether a given exotic hadron is the @xmath8 state _ or _ the tetraquark state _ or _ the mesonic molecule , and so on . this is not a proper question , because all possible configurations with the same quantum numbers should mix with each other in the quantum field theory .",
    "a hadronic state should be written as a superposition of all possible configurations and our task is to pin down the _ dominant _ configuration over the other components .",
    "let us take an example of the @xmath2 baryon , a negative parity excited state with the strangeness @xmath9 and the isospin @xmath10.@xcite in the conventional constituent quark model , this state is an orbital excitation of one of the three quarks of the ground state @xmath11 made of @xmath12.@xcite on the other hand , @xmath2 can be well described in the coupled - channel meson  baryon scattering model , which indicates the quasi - bound @xmath13 molecule picture for the @xmath2 resonance.@xcite moreover , it is also possible to consider a five - quark configuration ( @xmath12 plus @xmath8 ) where no orbital excitation is needed due to the negative parity of the antiquark.@xcite in this way , the structure of @xmath2 may be schematically decomposed as @xmath14 the dominant configuration is the one with the largest @xmath15 among others . at first glance",
    ", this strategy sounds reasonable .",
    "however , we should remember that a meaningful decomposition requires the orthogonality of the expansion basis . because the ground state mesons and baryons should be dominated by the @xmath8 and @xmath16 configurations ,",
    "it is plausible that the five - quark component has an overlap with the meson  baryon state , namely , @xmath17 this means that the basis is not orthogonal and the decomposition   is not adequate .",
    "in fact , two kinds of bases are mixed in eq .  ; the states with the quarks and the states with the hadrons . to begin with",
    ", we should choose the relevant degrees of freedom , otherwise the orthogonality of the basis is not clearly ensured .",
    "let us first examine the basis in terms of quarks ( and gluons , if necessary ) . in this case",
    ", the expansion of the @xmath2 may be @xmath18 in qcd , the number of quarks @xmath19 is conserved as a consequence of the vectorial u(1 ) symmetry . if we allow the existence of the antiquarks , what is conserved is the net quark number of the system , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of the antiquarks .",
    "we should however notice that the _ sum of the number of quarks and the number of antiquarks @xmath22 is not a conserved quantum number_. in other words , the qcd hamiltonian can create or annihilate any number of @xmath8 pairs without modifying the quantum number of the system .",
    "this means that the three - quark state is not orthogonal to the five - quark state , @xmath23 in this way , counting the number of quarks and antiquarks in a hadron is not a good classification scheme pairs are separated from the valence component and hence the fock space expansion is well defined.@xcite ] .",
    "this is because the quarks and gluons are not the asymptotic states of the qcd vacuum .    instead",
    ", it is possible to work with the hadronic degrees of freedom . in this case",
    ", the expansion may be @xmath24 an important difference from eq .",
    "is that each component is now written in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom which are the asymptotic states of the qcd vacuum .",
    "let us demonstrate the virtue of this fact , following the discussion in ref .  .",
    "consider the two - point correlation function of an operator @xmath25 which can create @xmath2 .",
    "the intermediate states can be expanded by the basis of eq .",
    "as @xmath26 the first term corresponds to the propagation of a single hadron as a whole , the second term represents the contribution from a two - hadron state @xmath27 , and so on .",
    "the fourier transform of the first term of the correlation function   is an analytic function of the energy variable . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution from the second term shows a non - analytic behavior at the threshold of the @xmath28 state @xmath29 . because the correlation function has an imaginary part above the threshold , the branch point exists at the threshold .",
    "thus , it may be possible to distinguish each component , by using the different analytic structure .",
    "note that this distinction is only possible with the asymptotic degrees freedom , otherwise the two - particle state does not exhibit the nonanalyticity .",
    "now , we have reached the first conclusion ; _ the structure of hadrons should be discussed in terms of the hadronic ( in general , asymptotic ) degrees of freedom_.      let us focus on a different aspect .",
    "a conventional strategy for the structure of hadrons is to compare the model prediction with experimental data , such as the mass spectra and the decay properties .",
    "for instance , the @xmath2 resonance is considered to be an exotic hadron rather than the simple @xmath16 state , because the light mass of @xmath2 is not well reproduced in the conventional three - quark model .",
    "this is fine as a first step , but we notice that this criterion loses power when the models are very much sophisticated .",
    "suppose that we try to improve the quark model by introducing various interaction potentials with many adjustable parameters .",
    "at the end of the day , we may be able to describe the @xmath2 resonance without disturbing the predictions of other hadrons , but with hundreds of parameters .",
    "clearly , the success of such a fine - tuned model does not convince us to regard the @xmath2 resonance as the three - quark state .",
    "it is more likely that the other components ( such as the meson  baryon molecules ) are effectively renormalized into the parameters of the complicated potential . in this sense",
    ", a good model description of a hadron does not necessarily mean that the structure of the hadron is dominated by the component of the model space .",
    "the same discussion is equally applied to the dynamical scattering model .",
    "we have mentioned that the @xmath2 resonance can be dominated by the meson  baryon molecule component , because of the success of the meson ",
    "baryon scattering model .",
    "again , this is fine as a first orientation , but is not always relevant for the same reasons . in some cases ,",
    "the calculation can be systematically improved with an well - founded expansion scheme , such as chiral perturbation theory.@xcite unfortunately , even in this case , the contribution other than the model space can be hidden in the model parameters .",
    "for instance , the effect of the vector mesons is included in the low - energy constants of the higher - order terms in chiral perturbation theory whose explicit degrees of freedom are the pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "this again indicates the vagueness of the connection of the model space and the structure of the described hadrons .",
    "related to this issue , it is important to recall the old discussion of the castillejo  dalitz ",
    "dyson ( cdd ) ambiguity.@xcite originally , it was shown that there is an ambiguity of adding any number of poles in the denominator function in the @xmath30 method@xcite ( see also a recent discussion on this ambiguity in connection with the crossing symmetry@xcite ) .",
    "the cdd pole contribution was later interpreted as the effect from an unstable elementary particle , because they are equivalent to each other within the @xmath30 framework.@xcite this means that the poles of the scattering amplitude can be generated not only from the dynamical effect by the interaction potential , but also from the subtraction of the dispersion integral .",
    "the former states are interpreted as dynamically generated states within the model space , while the latter states are introduced from the outside of the model space .",
    "in fact , it is explicitly demonstrated for the energy - dependent interaction that the subtraction constant in the loop function can play a role of the pole term in the interaction kernel.@xcite in this way , the prepared model space does not always correspond to the structure of the generated states in the scattering theory .    in summary , we argue that the origin of the hadrons is not exclusively attributed to the degrees of freedom of the models , and the other contributions can be hidden in the model parameters . in this sense , all these subtleties can be traced back to the lack of _ the model - independent measure of the hadron structure_. for instance , if the hadron structure is related to the experimental observables , it is a model - independent discussion .",
    "once we establish a model - independent quantity which characterizes the hadron structure , it is meaningful to calculate that quantity in various models , because the result can be compared with other models . in principle , such quantity can as well be calculated in the lattice qcd simulation .",
    "the model - independent nature is the second feature to be equipped in the desired framework of the hadron structure .",
    "yet another difficulty arises from the strong decay of the hadron excited states .",
    "the candidates for the exotic hadrons are identified in the spectrum of the excited states , most of them have a nonzero decay width via the strong interaction .",
    "although we have not explicitly considered the effect of the width so far , it induces further subtleties of the discussion of the hadron structure .",
    "for instance , we write the decomposition of the @xmath2 resonance in eqs .  , and , but the `` state vector '' in the left - hand side should be carefully constructed .    in the scattering theory ,",
    "the resonance states are identified by the poles of the scattering amplitude in the second ( unphysical ) riemann sheet of the complex energy plane .",
    "@xcite this is a natural generalization of the stable bound states which are expressed by the poles on the real axis of the first ( physical ) riemann sheet . through the comparison with the breit  wigner parametrization of the resonance amplitude ,",
    "the real ( imaginary ) part of the pole position is interpreted as the mass ( half width ) of the resonance state .    from this viewpoint",
    ", the resonance states can be regarded as the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with a complex eigenvalue .",
    "it is however not straightforward to construct the state vector with complex eigenvalues , because the eigenvalues of an hermite operator must be real in the normal hilbert space spanned by the square integrable functions .",
    "mathematically , complex eigenvalues can be achieved by the gamow vectors in the rigged hilbert space.@xcite in this case , however , the expectation value of an hermite operator becomes complex for the gamow states.@xcite in fact , the mean squared radii and the form factors of @xmath2 are obtained as complex numbers , when @xmath2 is treated as the resonance in the scattering amplitude.@xcite the interpretation of the complex - valued quantities is not straightforward .    in any event ,",
    "it is inevitable to consider the resonances for the discussion of the structure of the exotic hadrons",
    ". the ideal classification scheme should be applicable to the resonance states , with a natural interpretation of the obtained results .",
    "we have discussed the difficulties in the study of the structure of the exotic hadrons . in view of these discussions",
    ", we can summarize the desired feature of the proper classification scheme for the hadron structure as follows .",
    "* the structure of the hadrons should be classified in terms of the _ hadronic degrees of freedom _ , and * the scheme should be _ model independent _ and hopefully related to the _ experimental observables _ , and * the _ unstable resonance states _ can be treated in the same way with the stable bound states with providing a meaningful interpretation of the results .    as a matter of fact , there is no framework which completely satisfies all these requirements , especially for the last point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bound ] , we introduce one of the best approaches for the hadron structure , utilizing the compositeness of hadrons .",
    "this method defines the compositeness in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom , which can be model - independently related to the experimental observables in the weak - binding limit .",
    "its generalization to the resonances is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : resonance ] .",
    "in the early 1960s , one of the central problems in the particle physics was to distinguish between elementary and composite particles .",
    "it is eventually realized that the field renormalization constant @xmath31 is useful for this distinction  @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath31 represents the probability of finding the elementary component in the physical state , and the quantity @xmath32 stands for the compositeness of the state .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the field renormalization constant of a weakly bound state can be related to the threshold parameters ( the scattering length and the effective range ) in a model - independent way  @xcite . with this method ,",
    "the deuteron was shown to be dominated by the two - nucleon composite structure .",
    "this conclusion is of course naturally expected from the study of the nuclear force .",
    "but the conclusion of ref .   is drawn without any information on the @xmath33 potential and the wave function of the deuteron .",
    "strictly speaking , the potentials and wave functions are not observables and can be simultaneously changed by the unitary transformation with keeping the physical observables unchanged . in the same way ,",
    "the field renormalization constant in general is also a scheme - dependent quantity .",
    "the virtue of the analysis in ref .",
    "is that the field renormalization constant is model - independently related to the experimental observables , by taking the weak - binding limit .",
    "this is suitable for our strategy described in the previous section .    in the following ,",
    "we review the formulation of the compositeness using the field renormalization constant in the case of the stable bound states , basically following ref .  .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the single - channel scattering with one bound state , and suppress the indices for possible internal degrees of freedom ( such as spin , isospin , etc . ) which can be amended straightforwardly .",

    "we can also consider the system where the asymptotic degrees freedom are different from those in the original hamiltonian .",
    "this is indeed the case in qcd ; because of the color confinement , the asymptotic degrees of freedom in the low - energy vacuum are the hadrons , not the quarks and gluons in the qcd hamiltonian . in such cases ,",

    "by truncating the expansion up to the @xmath204 order , the amplitude is completely specified by the scattering length @xmath206 and the effective range @xmath207 . in this case , the poles of the amplitude are determined by @xmath332 as in eqs .   and is opposite to that in ref .  .",
    "] @xmath333 for the single - channel scattering , the scattering length and the effective range are always real . the classification of the nature of these poles is given in ref .  .",
    "the near - threshold resonance can be realized with the negative effective range @xmath334 .",
    "thus , eq .   determines the scattering length and the effective range by the pole position of the near - threshold resonance . by eliminating @xmath225 from eqs .   and , we can express the field renormalization constant by @xmath332 as @xmath335 it is found that the compositeness @xmath213 is purely imaginary , and normalized within @xmath336 for the resonances.@xcite because the normalization of the state vector is the crucial problem of the resonances , this may provide a hint for the interpretation of the compositeness of the resonances .",
    "it is also worth noting that the single - channel near - threshold resonance is realized only with the negative effective range.@xcite as discussed in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : interpretation ] , negativeness of the effective range is a measure of the contribution other than the scattering channel of interest . in other words ,",
    "the existence of the near - threshold resonance itself implies the noncomposite nature of its structure .      in the recent works,@xcite the field renormalization",
    "constant @xmath31 of the @xmath98-wave and @xmath99-wave hadron resonances has been evaluated by eqs .  , and .",
    "we summarize the results of the field renormalization constant @xmath31 in table  [ tbl : z ] .",
    "we also show the absolute values @xmath337 for reference . in some cases , the result depends on the cutoff of the loop function , reflecting the scheme - dependent nature of the field renormalization constant .    the field renormalization constant @xmath31 measures the effect of the elementary contribution as the deviation from unity , while it is obtained as a complex number .",
    "a naive prescription for the interpretation is to take the absolute value.@xcite another prescription is to take the real part.@xcite in the examples shown in table  [ tbl : z ] , two prescriptions provides roughly the same result , thanks to the relatively small imaginary part .",
    "we should again keep in mind that these numbers are not directly interpreted as the `` probability '' of the elementary component .",
    "this is clear because the result sometimes exceeds unity , as seen in the @xmath338 meson and the @xmath339 baryon cases .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that the magnitude of @xmath31 ( or @xmath340 ) should reflect the amount of the elementary component,@xcite to some extent .",
    "it is an important future project to establish a firm interpretation of the field renormalization constant of the resonances .",
    "we have been discussing the structure of hadrons from the viewpoint of the compositeness .",
    "this approach satisfies two conditions for a proper classification scheme summarized in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : conditions ] ; the compositeness is defined by the hadronic degrees of freedom and can be related to experimental observables . on the other hand ,",
    "the extension to the resonances is not straightforward and we have not yet established a satisfactory method , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : resonance ] . in the followings",
    ", we review the other approaches to study the structure of hadrons from different viewpoints .",
    "since the different approaches shed light on the different aspects of the hadrons , the comparison of several approaches will be helpful to elucidate the nature of the exotic hadrons .",
    "let us consider a particle embedded in a surrounding environment . in general , when the environment ( temperature , density , magnetic field , etc .",
    ") changes , the properties of the embedded particle ( mass , width , etc . ) will be modified , accordingly .",
    "the modification of the properties is driven by the interaction of the particle with the environment , so it reflects the structure of the particle .",
    "it is therefore a common exercise to investigate the response of the particle to the change of the environment , in order to pin down its structure .",
    "qcd is the gauge theory with the local color su(3 ) symmetry , but it is known that the generalization to the su(@xmath341 ) theory with @xmath342 offers new insight into the study of the strong interaction by the simple counting of the combinatorial factors.@xcite one of the interesting consequences of the large @xmath341 limit is the simplified hadron structure in terms of the quarks and gluons .",
    "the @xmath341 counting tells us that a meson which survives in the large @xmath341 limit should be a pure @xmath8 state or a glueball .",
    "can survive in the large @xmath341 limit .",
    "] this leads to the @xmath341 scaling low of the mass and width of the @xmath8 meson as @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",
    "in the same way , the mass and width of the @xmath341-quark baryon @xmath345 behave as @xmath346 and @xmath347 .    the properties of a hadron resonance can be extrapolated to arbitrary @xmath341 by the theoretical models at @xmath348 with the general @xmath341 scaling of the model parameters . comparing the model prediction with the @xmath341 scaling rules of the @xmath8 meson and the @xmath341-quark baryon",
    ", we extract the quark structure of hadrons .",
    "this strategy is initiated in refs .   for the @xmath338 and @xmath349 mesons in the @xmath350 scattering .",
    "the @xmath341 dependence is included in the low - energy constants of chiral perturbation theory , and the resonance pole position can be calculated for a given @xmath341 .",
    "the deviation from the general scaling rule of the @xmath8 meson reflects the amount of the non-@xmath8 component of the resonance .",
    "the method is then applied to the axial vector mesons@xcite and to the negative parity baryon resonances.@xcite in addition to the @xmath341 extrapolation method using chiral models , it is also possible to extract the quark structure by estimating the magnitude of the @xmath351 corrections in the experimental observables.@xcite    another approach is to utilize the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "when chiral symmetry is partially restored , threshold enhancement is expected to occur in the @xmath350 scattering amplitude in the scalar - isoscalar channel , as a consequence of the movement of the pole of the @xmath338 meson .",
    "this is called the softening phenomena.@xcite it is shown that the behavior of the softening depends qualitatively on the structure of the @xmath338 meson .  @xcite since chiral symmetry is expected to restore in the nuclear medium , this method opens a possibility of the experimental test for the structure of the @xmath338 meson .    as a general remark on these approaches",
    ", we point out the nature transition during the extrapolation",
    ". the hadrons may not keep its original nature , after a long extrapolation from the physical world .",
    "for instance , a mesonic molecule state at @xmath348 can in principle be continuously extrapolated to the @xmath8-dominated state at very large @xmath341 . in this case , the scaling analysis at very large @xmath341 does not make sense to determine the nature of the physical meson .",
    "this aspect is theoretically formulated as the mixing problem in the two - level model in ref .  , where the condition for the nature transition is related to the geometrical structure in the complex parameter space .",
    "to avoid the ambiguity of the nature transition along with the extrapolation , the properties of the hadrons should be studied in the parameter region not very far from the real world .",
    "the spatial size is a basic quantity that characterizes the structure of a particle .",
    "first of all , there is no conceptual ambiguity in the definition of the size ( the spatial extent of the wave function ) .",
    "although it is not directly related to the internal structure of the hadrons , we can speculate the typical size from its construction .",
    "for instance , the hadronic molecule structure should have a larger size than the single - hadron state whose size is estimated by the energy scale of the color confinement ( @xmath352 1 fm ) .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath2 resonance are evaluated in refs .   and .",
    "unfortunately , the difficulty of the resonances also applies to the form factors .",
    "because the form factor is defined as the matrix element of the electromagnetic current by the state vector , it is obtained as a complex number for the resonances .",
    "this causes the problem of the interpretation , but the magnitude of the mean squared radius indicates a larger spatial size of @xmath2 than the normal hadrons.@xcite    recently , a novel method to obtain a real - valued size of the resonances is proposed through the finite volume effect.@xcite a general discussion on the properties of a stable bound state in a finite box is given in ref .  .",
    "the mass shift of the bound state due to the finite volume effect is related to the coupling constant of the bound state to the scattering state in the infinite volume .",
    "this method is extended to the shift of the resonance pole position when a closed channel is put into a finite box , and the size is estimated as a real number.@xcite we note that the finite volume effect provides a new definition of the `` size '' of the resonances , which does not exactly coincide with that defined from the complex form factor .",
    "in addition , the applicability of the method is limited to the spatial size of the closed channels .",
    "it is however important to extract the real - valued information of the size of the resonances .",
    "the result indicates a larger size of @xmath2 , in accordance with the form factor approach .      as emphasized in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : conditions ] , the structure of the hadrons should be eventually examined by the experimental observables .",
    "one way is to focus on the production mechanism , since different structures may be produced in different ways .",
    "a study in this direction is performed by focusing on the hadronization process in the heavy ion collisions.@xcite it is shown that the production yield of a hadron in the heavy ion collisions depends qualitatively on the structure of the hadron ( multiquark or hadronic molecule ) .",
    "this study therefore provides an experimental verification for the structure of hadrons .",
    "it should be noted that the definition of the hadron structure in this approach is based on the hadronization mechanism , which does not exactly correspond to the definitions in other approaches .",
    "again , comparison with different approaches will help elucidating the structure of the exotic hadrons .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the subtle issues in the study of the structure of the hadron resonances , and to present the possible solution to this problem .",
    "based on a comprehensive discussion on the difficulty of the definition of the hadron structure , we conclude that the desired framework for the hadron structure should be given with the hadronic degrees of freedom and possibly in a model - independent manner .",
    "the applicability to the resonances with a suitable interpretation is also necessary .",
    "it is shown that the compositeness approach with the field renormalization constant is a good candidate for this strategy ; the compositeness is well defined for the stable bound states , and is model - independently related to the experimental observables in the weak - binding limit .",
    "we would like to emphasize the following ( not well - known ) aspects of this approach .    *",
    "the normalization of the state vector @xmath91 and the non - negativeness of the field renormalization constant @xmath353 are crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of the compositeness / elementariness . *",
    "the compositeness of the bound state with an arbitrary binding energy depends on the choice of the basis of the bare hamiltonian ( the way to decompose the full hamiltonian @xmath34 into @xmath62 and @xmath37 ) . in other words , the compositeness is a scheme - dependent quantity .",
    "this scheme dependence vanishes in the weak - binding limit , where the compositeness is model - independently related to the experimental observables . *",
    "the elementariness is interpreted as the fraction of the cdd pole contribution which is anything other than the scattering states in the given model space .",
    "once the model space is specified , the origin of the elementariness can not be known .",
    "because the elementariness is expressed by the energy dependence of the potential , it can be traced back to the consequence of the elimination of the coupled - channel effect in a larger model space . in the weak - binding limit ,",
    "the magnitude of the negative effective range reflects the elementariness .",
    "we discuss the generalization of the compositeness approach to the resonances .",
    "it is shown that the normalization of the resonance vector can be expressed by the generalized ward identity .",
    "on the other hand , the field renormalization constant becomes a complex number , reflecting the bi - orthogonal nature of the resonance state vectors .",
    "it is still an open problem to establish a firm framework which is capable of treating the resonances with a suitable interpretation of the result .",
    "we hope that the discussion in this paper serves as a useful cornerstone for future developments in the study of the structure of the hadron resonances .",
    "the author is grateful to all the collaborators of the studies for the hadron structure .",
