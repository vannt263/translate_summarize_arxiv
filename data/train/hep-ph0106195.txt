    "these past few years , there has been a concerted effort to find approximation schemes for time evolution problems that go beyond mean field theory , such as the hartree@xcite or the leading order in @xmath2 approximations@xcite .",
    "although these approximations are able to give a reasonable picture of the phase diagram of quantum field theories ( see for example@xcite ) , there are no true hard scatterings in mean field theory , so there is no mechanism for a system which is out of equilibrium to be driven back into equilibrium .",
    "thus various phenomena found in these early simulations , such as production of disoriented chiral condensates [ dcc s ] , and distortion of the low momentum spectra away from that of thermal equilibrium , might very well be modified when hard scatterings are taken into account .",
    "this is especially true in the phenomenological @xmath4 sigma model for the chiral phase transition where the effective low energy couplings are large . in relativistic heavy ion collider [ rhic ] physics applications it is important to know , given an expanding plasma , how the time scale for equilibration compares with the time scale for the expansion of the plasma in order to decide whether effects found in the mean field approximation persist following the chiral phase transition .",
    "initial attempts to go beyond mean field theory , such as truncating the coupled hierarchy of n - point functions at the 4- or 6-point function level@xcite , as well as naive use of the @xmath2 expansion@xcite , have suffered from serious drawbacks such as negative definite probability and/or secular behavior .",
    "these problems , although present in naive perturbation theory , were not present in the mean field approximation because the mean field approximation can be shown to be equivalent to a hamiltonian dynamical system .",
    "because of these failures , recent attention has been shifted to resummation methods based on schwinger - dyson [ sd ] equations resulting from keeping leading terms in the series for the two particle irreducible [ 2-pi ] generating functional that occurs in the @xmath5 derivable approach of baym@xcite , or equivalently the formalism of cornwall , jackiw , and tomboulis [ cjt ]  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to looking at two proposed resummation methods based on the 2-pi approach .",
    "the first approach , is a direct use of the loop expansion for the 2-pi generating functional espoused by cjt .",
    "this approach has been used to study thermalization in the quantum version of the problem discussed here by berges and cox@xcite .",
    "the second method is to first obtain the exact sd equations in the auxiliary field formalism@xcite , and then to make the assumption that one can ignore vertex corrections .",
    "this approximation also can be obtained from the 2-pi formalism when we include propagators for the auxiliary field .",
    "this latter method we recently applied successfully to the quantum roll problem in 0 + 1 dimensions@xcite , where we found that the approximation is a resummation of the next - to - leading order @xmath2 expansion , which cures the defects of the large-@xmath6 expansion in next - to - leading order .",
    "in this paper we will apply these approximations to a field theory problem where exact calculations can be carried out .",
    "namely we will consider the time evolution of an initially gaussian ensemble of classical fields in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we will compare the results of the sd equation approximations with the exact simulation as well as with the hartree approximation . to make contact with earlier work in this area by aarts , bonini , and wetterich@xcite , which went beyond hartree approximation by truncating the hierarchy of green functions at the four point function level",
    ", we will calculate the same variables used by those authors as well as use their initial conditions . since the quantum evolution in the high temperature limit reduces to this classical field theory problem , by showing that the bare vertex approximation [ bva ] gives reasonable quantitative agreement for the classical evolution we guarantee that the bva gives reasonable results for the _ quantum _ evolution in the high temperature regime .",
    "the bva approximation we espouse here is certainly not new .",
    "it was first introduced by kraichnan@xcite as the `` direct interaction approximation , '' which he used to study classical and quantum dynamical systems .",
    "what kraichnan showed was that this approximation , like the hartree , was realizable as a dynamical system and thus was free from the secularity problem as well as having a positive definite density matrix .",
    "a method of deriving these _ classical _ sd equations was obtained in the classic paper of martin , siggia and rose [ msr ]  @xcite .",
    "although quantum field theorists are now familiar with the schwinger - keldysh closed time path [ ctp ] formalism for initial value problems@xcite , the related formalism of msr is less familiar , and so we devote an appendix to deriving the exact sd equations for both _ classical _ as well as quantum dynamical systems and discuss the connection between the ctp and msr formalisms .",
    "a more extensive dicussion of this connection has just been published@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : theory ] we discuss the classical field theory simulation we are using as a benchmark for various approximations . in section  [ s : hartree ]",
