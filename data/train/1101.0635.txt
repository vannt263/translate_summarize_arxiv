    "sn 2007bi was found as an extremely luminous type ic supernova ( sn ic ) .",
    "spectral analyses deduced the production of @xmath7 m@xmath1 of radioactive @xmath8ni @xcite . the metallicity of the host galaxy of sn 2007bi , which is a subluminous dwarf galaxy , has been observed to be @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath10 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this metallicity is similar to those of low - metallicity galaxies undergoing @xmath12-ray bursts ( grbs ) associated with sne .",

    "hence , the explosion mechanism of sn 2007bi has not yet been clarified .",

    "a sn with an @xmath16 m@xmath1 progenitor can produce more than 3 m@xmath1 of @xmath8ni when the explosion energy is @xmath17 erg .",

    "in this letter , we evaluate the mass range of very massive stars with initial metallicity of @xmath4 ( @xmath18 @xmath11 ) appropriate for the progenitor of sn 2007bi .",
    "we calculate the evolution of very massive stars with ms mass range @xmath3 m@xmath1 taking into account uncertainties in mass - loss rate .",

    "the stellar evolution code was updated from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used a nuclear reaction network consisting of 282 species of nuclei from n , p , to br to calculate the time evolution of the chemical composition distribution and nuclear energy generation .",

    "for the convection treatment we assumed the schwarzschild criterion for convective instability , and a diffusive treatment for the convective mixing .",
    "the opacity was evaluated using tables of opal opacity @xcite , molecular opacity @xcite , and conductive opacity @xcite .      since mass - loss rates suffer from various uncertainties , we present models computed with the following three different mass - loss recipes .",

    "the ms mass range strongly depends on the surface he conditions .",
    "if he lines appear with a total he mass larger than 0.5 m@xmath1 , then there is no mass range of the pi sn model for sn 2007bi . the ms mass range of the cc sn model is also limited to @xmath82 m@xmath1 .",
    "however , this condition may be too strict , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "if the progenitors explode as type ic sne with @xmath83 m@xmath1 or @xmath68 , the ms mass range is mainly determined by the condition of the co core mass .",

    "if he lines are not seen for @xmath85 m@xmath1 or @xmath68 , the probability of the cc sn model is about 40 times larger than that of the pi sn model in case a. in case b , the pi sn model is not adequate for sn 2007bi because of large mass loss . in case c , on the other hand , the probability of the cc sn model is larger than that of the pi sn model by a factor of 5 .",
    "however , if he lines are observed with a total he mass of @xmath86 m@xmath1 , the pi sn model is inadequate for sn 2007bi in all mass - loss cases .",
    "it is important to establish more definite classification criteria for sne ic .",
    "it has been argued that very massive co cores would collapse to form black holes and become dark or very faint sne ( e.g. , review in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , the probability of explosion as a cc sn would become much smaller",
    ". observational or theoretical evaluation of the fraction of dark or faint sne in the death of very massive stars will more precisely constrain the probability of the cc sn model .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of very massive stars with @xmath87 m@xmath1 and @xmath4 from h burning to central he exhaustion to constrain the progenitor of an extremely luminous type ic sn 2007bi .",
    "if sn 2007bi is a pi sn , the progenitor could be evolved from a ms star with 515 @xmath51 @xmath48 @xmath51 575 m@xmath1 .",
    "if sn 2007bi is a cc sn , the appropriate range of the ms mass is 110 @xmath51 @xmath48 @xmath51 280 m@xmath1 .",
    "when we take into account a salpeter imf , the probability of sn 2007bi exploding as a cc sn is about 40 times larger than for a pi sn . if the mass - loss rate is small , the minimum mass for the progenitor becoming a pi sn is about 310 m@xmath1 .",
    "the mass range changes to @xmath88 m@xmath1 for the pi sn model and @xmath89 m@xmath1 for the cc sn model . if the mass - loss rate is large or he lines appear for an he mass of @xmath86 m@xmath1 , then sn 2007bi should have exploded as a cc sn . although the light curve of sn 2007bi was fitted by both the pi sn and cc sn models , the cc sn model is favoured as explaining the explosion of sn 2007bi from arguments based on the probability ratio of the pi sn model appropriate for sn 2007bi to the cc sn model .",
    "we should note that the conditions of he abundance for the progenitor to become a type ic sn strongly affect the probability of a pi sn .",
    "if a total he mass @xmath86 m@xmath1 enables the formation of he spectra , the pi sn model would be inadequate for sn 2007bi even for a small mass - loss rate .",
    "it is quite important to evaluate more definite criteria to classify sne ic .",
    "we also note the probability of direct collapse without bright sne for cc sn cases .",
    "this would reduce the probability of a cc sn for sn 2007bi .",
    "it is necessary to evaluate theoretically or observationally the fraction of black hole formation without bright sne in cc sne .",
    "if the progenitor of sn 2007bi or a more massive star was rotating very fast , it could explode as a sn ic associated with a grb .",
