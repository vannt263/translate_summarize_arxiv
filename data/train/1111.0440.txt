    "+    one of the main aims of the survey is to obtain a substantial and homogeneous sample of stellar remnants and compact binaries with well - understood selection biases .",
    "a large and homogeneous sample is needed to answer questions in the fields of binary stellar evolution ( e.g. on the physics of the common - envelope phase ) , the earliest star formation history of our milky way , the influence of chemical composition on accretion disk physics , and the gravitational radiation foreground from compact binaries in our galaxy for missions such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa , nelemans et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "stellar remnant populations to be extracted from include single and binary white dwarfs , subdwarf b stars , cataclysmic variables , am canum venaticorum ( am cvn ) stars and neutron star and black hole binaries .",
    "our understanding of these populations is often limited due to the small number of known systems and/or strong selection biases in known samples ( see e.g. pretorius , knigge & kolb , 2007 ) . + traditionally blue / uv surveys , targeting quasars and agn , specifically concentrate on higher galactic latitudes to avoid the problems of crowding and dust extinction .",
    "the post - common - envelope objects mentioned above are generally hot but intrinsically faint so their absolute visual magnitudes are several magnitudes lower than main - sequence stars with similar colours . in the plane of the milky way an intrinsically blue , low - luminosity population of objects is visible in the @xmath6 vs. @xmath4 and @xmath6 vs. @xmath5 colour - magnitude diagrams as uv - excess sources against a background of higher luminosity , more distant and therefore more highly reddened , objects .",

    "dense fields usually have less reddening than sparse fields and there are simply more stars , causing both the intervals between successive main - sequence stars and the gap between the main - sequence and the uv - excess sources to shrink . because the number of intervals between main - sequence stars increases for dense fields the chance of finding a very long interval caused by statistical noise decreases and",

    "this is to avoid that scattered main - sequence sources that are just outside the selection box are added to the uv - excess catalogue ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] ) . the subdwarf population , closest to the main - sequence , can be reddened main - sequence stars if the spatial scale of the reddening strongly varies within the field of view of one pointing .",
    "another likely explanation is that these objects are a population of unreddened metal - poor stars , which can have absolute magnitudes fainter by up to two magnitudes compared with main - sequence stars of the same colour ( e.g. johnson , 1955 ) .",
