    "the succesful development of cosmology in the last two decades , incarnated in the popular  model , has provided a robust theoretical background for modeling galaxy formation and evolution ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the high non - linearity implied in the problem , cosmological",
    "n - body + hydrodynamical simulations offer the fairest way to attain such a modeling ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "however , this method is hampered by the large currently unreachable dynamic range required to model galaxy formation and evolution in the cosmological context ( formally from the subpc scales of molecular cloud cores to mpc scales , and from densities @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) , as well as by the complexity of the processes involved , mainly cooling and star formation ( sf ) and its feedback on the surrounding medium .",
    "both of them occur at scales commonly well below the accesible resolution in simulations .",
    "theoretical and observational results suggest that the star formation efficiency can be simulated without reaching the subparsec resolution if a simulation can resolve the mean density of giant molecular clouds @xcite , unfortunately this seems not to be the case for sn and stellar wind feedback .",
    "undoubtedly , modeling of sf and feedback ( subgrid physics ) is of crucial importance for the simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .    on the other hand ,",
    "the sf rate ( sfr ) and its evolution are among the most important observational properties of galaxies , being basically responsible for coining the present - day galactic stellar populations .",
    "star formation is also crucial in terms of its feedback effect , which ( i ) regulates several thermo- and hydro - dynamical processes of the multi - phase ism , including probably the sf itself ; ( ii ) partially controls the galaxy assembly process through mass outflows and re - heating of the circumgalactic medium , and ( iii ) likely is also the driving agent of the intergalactic chemical enrichment .    in the context of the hierarchical  scenario ,",
    "the efficient radiative cooling of gas leads to the so - called `` gas cooling catastrophe '' : most of the available primordial gas is cooled , trapped , and transformed into stars inside the smallest , early - collapsing halos @xcite . in order to avoid such a problem , the stellar negative feedback is routinely invoked ( see for recent works e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* though alternative physical processes have been also considered , e.g. , sommer - larsen & dolgov 2001 ; governato et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the same vein",
    ", it is well known now that the mass fraction of baryons in galaxies with respect to their halo masses is much smaller than the universal baryon fraction @xmath12 .",
    "the ` missing baryons ' are commonly assumed to have been expelled from galaxies by feedback effects , especially in the past , when the halos were smaller @xcite .    in the absence of a general theory of sf and feedback ,",
    "several prescriptions have been proposed in order to model the corresponding subgrid physics in numerical simulations at parsec scales or smaller , with the aim to properly extend sf / feedback influence into the larger ( tens / hundreds of parsecs ) resolved scales .",
    "unavoidably , subgrid sf and feedback prescriptions in simulations introduce several free parameters .    in simulations ,",
    "some of the common criteria used for declaring a gas cell or particle as star forming are converging cold gas flows , a local jeans instability and/or a local gas density threshold ( @xmath3 ) ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rate at which the gaseous mass element obeying the above criteria is converted into ` stars ' is calculated using recipes which introduce some free parameters like the sf efficieny constant @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to take into account the stochastic nature of gas conversion into stars , and also the fact that the minimum resolution element overlooks local variations in gas density , a probabilistic function around @xmath14 is typically introduced instead of a deterministic density criterion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the modeling of the feedback processes associated to the non - resolved regions , in which they start to operate ,",
    "two schemes are commonly used : individual gas elements surrounding a stellar particle are given a velocity kick ( kinematic feedback ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or are injected with thermal energy and metals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at the same time that , in some schemes , the radiative cooling is temporarly turn off to prevent the thermal energy from being radiated away before it is converted into kinetic energy ( adiabatic feedback ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , in other schemes , the interaction between neighbor particles belonging to different phases is inhibited by hand @xcite .",
    "a third scheme , often applied , imposes an effective gas equation of state in order to describe the unresolved multiphase ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hybrid schemes were also used : semi - analytical models of winds and starburts dependent on the gas physical conditions are included in the simulations @xcite . in all these feedback schemes there are free parameters , such as the amounts of momentum and thermal energy deposited into the gas elements , the time the cooling is switched off , @xmath15 , etc .",
    "the values for the free parameters in the sf and feedback prescriptions are chosen in different ways .",
    "they can be defined _ a priori _ , based on constraints typically related to observations of the galaxy ism , and/or _ a posteriori _ , choosing the parameter values that make the evolution and properties of the simulated galaxy close to the observed ones .",
    "the prescriptions and parameters used also depend on whether the code is of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) or eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) kind .    because of the large diversity of models , strategies , and relevant parameters of sf / feedback implementations , a comparison between them is not trivial .",
    "although some implementations in high  resolution simulations have reached an amount of success forming rotational supported disk galaxies ( see , for recent reviews , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the task is far from being completed .",
    "it is not clear what are the quantitative differences between each subgrid model .",
    "thus , a characterization of the various subgrid schemes for the ism energy injection and dissipation is needed to gain some insight into their ability / inability to form disk galaxies .    in this paper , we explore the effects of the sf / feedback parameters on the structure and evolution of a _ low - mass galaxy _ in cosmological simulations using the hydrodynamics adaptive refinement tree ( art ) code @xcite .",
    "we reach a maximum resolution of about one hundred parsecs at redshift @xmath16 in order to be able to resolve the clouds associated with the sf ; most of our analysis is made at this epoch and at @xmath17 , the last epoch reached by all the runs .",
    "our nominal resolution extrapolated to @xmath1 is of 218 pc , which is among the highest resolutions for a cosmological galaxy formation experiment using the amr / eulerian technique ( c.f .",
    "we will focus our analysis on general evolutionary and physical properties / processes of the simulated galaxies , namely : ( i ) the evolution of structural and dynamical properties ( e.g. , galaxy stellar structure , circular velocity curve decomposition ) , ( ii ) the structure / thermodynamics of the ism ( density and temperature probability distribution functions , vertical filling factors of the different phases of the ism , gas fractions ) , ( iii ) the dependence of the global sf history and the sfr on gas density , and ( iv ) global quantities like the baryon mass and angular momentum fractions .",
    "our aim here is not to simulate galaxies that can be compared to observations , but rather to determine the effects of the parameters of the sf / feedback prescriptions .",
    "moreover , we will use our results to point out some potential difficulties of simulated low ",
    "mass galaxies in the context of the  cosmogony .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the code and the sf and feedback prescriptions used for the simulations are described in  2 . in this section ,",
    "the cosmological simulation and the different runs varying the sf / feedback parameters are also presented .",
    "the results of the various runs are given and compared with each other in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present a summary of the main results obtained in the paper accompanied by interpretations and discussions .",
    "some potential vexing problems of any -based model of low  mass galaxy formation and evolution are hihglighted in  4.3 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "the numerical simulations described here were performed using the hydrodynamics + n - body adaptive refinement tree code art @xcite . among the physical processes included in the code",
    "are the cooling of the gas and its subsequent conversion into stars , stellar feedback , self - consistent advection of metals , an uv heating background source , etc .",
    "the cooling and heating rates incorporate compton heating / cooling , atomic and molecular cooling , uv heating from a cosmological background radiation @xcite , and are tabulated for a temperature range of @xmath18 and a grid of densities , metallicities , and redshifts using the cloudy code @xcite .",
    "gas is converted into stellar particles according to a prescription described and discussed below .",
    "stellar particles eject metals and thermal energy through stellar winds and type ii and ia supernovae explosions .",
    "each supernova dumps @xmath19 of thermal energy and ejects @xmath20 of metals . for the assumed @xcite initial mass function , imf , a stellar particle of @xmath21 produces 749 type ii supernovae . for a more detailed discussion of the processes implemented in the code , see @xcite .      in art , sf is modeled as taking place in the coldest and densest collapsed regions , defined by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the temperature and density of the gas , respectively , and @xmath26 is a density threshold .",
    "a stellar particle of mass @xmath27 is placed in a grid cell where these conditions are simultaneously satisfied , and this mass is removed from the gas mass in the cell",
    ". the particle subsequently follows n - body dynamics .",
    "no other criteria are imposed .",
    "although @xmath3 , the hydrogen number density threshold corresponding to @xmath26 , is in principle a free parameter of the simulations , one can make an `` educated guess '' as to which values should be considered most realistic , by noting that sf occurs almost exclusively in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to require that the density in a star - forming cell should be at least such that the cell s column density equals the threshold value for molecular hydrogen and co formation , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "for a cell of 150 pc , this translates into a number density @xmath29 . in our models , @xmath3 is varied around this value from 0.1 to 50 @xmath30 .",
    "we keep @xmath31 fixed at 9000 k.    the stellar particle mass , @xmath27 , is determined through a simple two - step process . a first estimate of this mass , labeled @xmath32 , is made by assuming that @xmath27 is proportional to a power law of the gas density , @xmath33 .",
    "in this work we use @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in this step , collisionless stellar particles can be created with a mass @xmath35 , where @xmath13 is a constant that measures the `` efficiency '' with which gas is locally converted into stars during @xmath36 , the time step of the coarsest grid , which is also the time interval between successive checks by the code for the formation of new stellar particles ; @xmath37 is the gas mass in the cell . for low values of @xmath13 , for example @xmath38 ( the fiducial value in the code ) ,",
    "the formula above produces small @xmath32 values .",
    "however , this makes the number of stellar particles in the simulation practically intractable .",
    "for this reason , a stellar particle mass limit is introduced in the sf set of parameters , labeled @xmath39 .",
    "the sf algorithm then chooses the maximum between @xmath32 and @xmath39 , which we call @xmath40 . in the second step ,",
    "the algorithm takes the minimum between @xmath40 and 2/3 of the gas mass contained in the cell and assigns this mass to the stellar particle , in order to prevent total exhaustion of the gas contents of the cell .",
    "since the stellar particle masses are much more massive than the mass of a star , typically @xmath41  @xmath42 , once formed , each stellar particle is considered as a single stellar population , within which the individual stellar masses are distributed according to the miller & scalo imf .",
    "the simulations reported here are of two kinds : those with a `` deterministic '' sf prescription ( the `` d '' runs ) , in which stellar particles are always created once the density and temperature conditions are satisfied , and those with a `` stochastic '' or `` random '' sf prescription ( the `` r '' runs ) , in which stellar particles are created in a cell with a probability given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a free parameter , to which we refer as the probability - saturation threshold .",
    "thus , regions with higher densities have higher probabilities to host sf events .",
    "this stochastic prescription allows for the possibility of forming stars in regions of low average density ( assuming we have chosen a low @xmath3 parameter ) , in which isolated dense clouds would not be resolved .",
    "the runs can also be divided in two classes according to the stellar feedback implementation . in the first class of runs",
    ", all the energy from stellar feedback is dumped onto the star - forming cell in the form of heat , as described , for example , in @xcite .",
    "this thermal feedback suffers from the well - known overcooling problem in low - resolution simulations .",
    "this problem can be traced back to insufficient numerical resolution @xcite , and happens when the characteristic expansion time in a cell heated by a stellar particle ( given by the sound crossing time across the cell ) is much longer than the cooling time at high densities and low resolutions ( large cell size ) . in this case ,",
    "in a single timestep , the gas cools before it has time to expand . the resolution condition to avoid this problem",
    "would then be to require that the sound crossing time across the cell be shorter than the local cooling time .",
    "this , however , can require impossibly high resolutions with presently available computational resources .    a frequent strategy to overcome this problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to turn off the cooling in a cell for some time after a stellar particle is produced there , in order to allow for the gas to expand before it cools .",
    "although this procedure has been criticized as being somewhat arbitrary and unrealistic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider that it is physically motivated , as it is even more unrealistic to prevent the expansion of heated regions due to the inability to resolve the scales that would allow the physically correct behavior of these regions . in the present paper",
    "we therefore adopt this strategy , and test its effects on the evolution of the forming galaxy . specifically , we turn off the cooling in a cell for 40 myr after a sf event occurs there in some of the runs ( see table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "we present here several simulations of the evolution of a galaxy with a total ( baryon + dark matter ) mass of about @xmath45 at the present day .",
    "the analysis is made at two epochs , @xmath46 and @xmath2 .",
    "the latter corresponds to a time just before the last major merger .",
    "the simulations are run in a   cosmolgy with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the cdm power spectrum is taken from @xcite and it is normalized to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in 8 spheres .    to maximize the resolution efficiency , we first perform a low - resolution n - body simulation with @xmath52 dark matter ( dm ) particles in a periodic box of @xmath53 on a side . at the start of the simulation , the box",
    "is initially covered by a mesh of @xmath52 cells ( zeroth level cells ) .",
    "a spherical region , centered on a _ randomly _ selected halo of mass @xmath54 and with a radius equal to three times the virial radius ( ) of the halo , was then chosen at @xmath55 and its corresponding lagrangian region , identified at @xmath56 , was re - sampled with additional small - scale modes @xcite .",
    "the virial radius is defined as the radius that encloses a mean density equal to @xmath57 times the mean density of the universe , where @xmath57 is a quantity that depends on @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "for example , for our cosmology @xmath61 .",
    "the number of dm particles in the high - resolution zone is about one million and the mass per particle ( @xmath62 ) is @xmath63 .    in art , the initially uniform grid is refined recursively as the matter distribution evolves .",
    "the criterion chosen for refinement is based on gas or dark matter densities .",
    "the cell is refined when the mass in dm particles exceeds 1.3@xmath64 or the mass in gas is higher than 13.0@xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "for the simulations presented in this paper , using multiple dark matter particle masses , the grid is always unconditionally refined to the third level , corresponding to an effective grid size of @xmath67 . on the other hand , the maximum allowed refinement level @xmath68",
    "was set to 9 . at @xmath46 ,",

    "the region in which we compute the pdfs contains a mixture of cold and warm - hot / hot gas , heated very likely by shocks .    from run",

    "therefore , by allowing for more massive stellar particles ( a more efficient conversion of gas to stars ) , the galaxy produces a higher fraction of low - density and hot gas .",

    "mass galaxy , the stellar effective radius increases by a factor of @xmath8 , the galaxy becomes less concentrated , and its @xmath7 profile becomes flatter than in the weak - feedback simulation ( c.f . runs d2 and d3 ) .",
    "_ a stronger feedback helps also to keep an episodic sfh_. a complex multi  phase structure in the disk is favored by the action of feedback but if it is too strong , the low  density , warm and hot gas can be completely blown away from the disk , as it seems to be the case in run d4 .",
    "the warm and hot gas seen above the disk plane can be produced by two mechanisms : ( 1 ) shocks of the infalling gas , and/or ( 2 ) gas heated and ejected from the mid - plane by supernovae and stellar winds . which is the dominant process depends on the infalling history of the gas and on the efficacy of the stellar feedback .",
    "for example , in run d1 ( weak feedback ) it is very unlikely that the hot gas seen at intermediate altitudes ( @xmath162 ) is produced by the second mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "the increasing amount of hot gas seen at very high altitudes ( as high as @xmath163 ) in runs d4 , r3 , and r4 at @xmath46 appears to come from the second mechanism .",
    "this is confirmed visually and by the analysis of the gas @xmath164 distribution , where @xmath164 is the gas velocity component perpendicular to the plane of the disk .",
    "figure [ fig : vzimage ] shows run r3 at @xmath46 .",
    "the projected spatial distribution of the gas temperature and of the @xmath60 velocity component are shown in left and right panels , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : vzd ] , on the other hand , shows the @xmath164 normalized distribution of runs d1 , d3 , d4 , and r3 at @xmath46 .",
    "here we have used all cells inside . unlike runs d1 and d3 , runs d4 and r3 exhibit high @xmath165 wings , corresponding to a galactic wind .",
    "several of the results described above can be understood as a consequence of the efficiency by which the thermal energy is injected into the ism and the ability of the medium to self  regulate its sf .",
    "the r2r4 random  sf sequence ( cooling turned off after sf events ) shows that the reduction in @xmath3 causes : ( a ) a flatter circular velocity profile ; ( b ) a stronger spheroidal stellar component ; ( c ) a thicker disk ; and when run r2 is compared with r3 or r4 , ( d ) a delay of the maximum of sfr . the deterministic ",
    "sf sequence shows that , at fixed @xmath3 ( runs d2 , d3 , and d4 ) , a greater ability of sf to heat the gas causes a more efficient self  regulation of sf , preventing the gas from going into stars too rapidly .",
    "this gives flatter @xmath7 profile and allows the gas to settle into an extended disk configuration .",
    "however , when feedback is strong enough to produce galactic superwinds , the self  regulation can be interrumped and sf proceeds in a bursty regime .",
    "indeed , run d4 is the one where ejecting feedback is most efficient and it is also the one with the most bursty sfh .",
    "a multi  phase structure of the galactic ism is not easy to attain in cosmological numerical simulations ( see for a discussion , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , we see in run d1 that only the cold phase is present in the mid - plane of the disk while in run d2 the hot phase is absent ( see figure [ fig : ffd ] ) .",
    "these two runs have an inefficient feedback , but even in those for which the cooling is switched off for 40 myr after each sf event ( strong feeback , runs d3 and d4 ) , the hot phase is also absent .",
    "the only run in which a a multi  phase medium is observed at the analyzed epochs is r2 .",
    "its density and temperature pdfs show wide and nearly bimodal distributions , with different gas phases , from cold  warm dense gas to hot low  density gas , coexisting within the galaxy .",
    "the increase of the sfr with time of run r2 is more gradual and not too bursty , which suggests a more uniformly self  regulated sf process with only small episodic phases .",
    "finally , this run takes the longest time to assemble the disk .    in summary ,",
    "the results of our experiments show that a multi ",
    "phase ism in low ",
    "mass galaxies is not a straightforward product of feedback and resolution . while the former certainly helps , in low ",
    "mass systems it also produces outflows that leave only cold / warm high ",
    "denstiy gas in the galaxy and induce a bursty sfh .",
    "finally , in our simulations the   relation tends to be significantly steeper than the empirical determinations for normal disk galaxies , which are typically explained by the quiescent , self  regulated nature of the sf process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we plot in figure [ fig : sigmasfr ] the fit to observations by @xcite for averages values of normal disk galaxies , their centers , and starbust galaxies ( solid line ) .",
    "this correlation is roughly maintained for azimuthally averaged elements along a given disk @xcite . as can be seen ,",
    "most of our runs at both @xmath16 and @xmath17 show a steeper local correlation than the observational fit of normal galaxies .",
    "overall , most of the simulation points lie around the observational fit .",
    "the points from run d1 , which is the run that suffers most from the overcooling problem , are the most distant from the fit .",
    "it is interesting to note that among lsb galaxies and along their azimuthally averaged elements , the ",
    "correlation has been found to be significantly steeper than the given by kenniccutt @xcite .",
    "lsb galaxies are typically of low mass .",
    "the subgrid physics used in run r1 differs from the rest of simulations explored herein . in run",
    "r1 the radiative cooling is not switched off but a signicant fraction of stars are modeled as runaway stars able to migrate to lower gas density regions .",
    "the sn explosions in the lower density gas , where the cooling time is long , are more efficient .",
    "this model has been succesful in reproducing many of the properties of milky way - sized galaxies @xcite . as shown here",
    ", it works reasonably well also for a low - mass galaxy .",
    "it successfully reproduces a roughly flat @xmath7 profile and a multiphase ism at the galaxy mid - plane .",
    "the model also has the lowest galaxy mass baryon fraction and relatively high angular momentum content . on the other hand ,",
    "its sfr was relatively too efficient at early epochs ( the first 1 - 2 gyr ) .",
    "as a result , at later times , @xmath166 , the sfr was lower than other ` feedback - efficient ' models , and the model ends up with a lower fraction of mass in gas ( see , for example , r1 versus d3 ) .",
    "these effects are probably caused by the high value used for the star formation efficiency , @xmath13 .",
    "overall , run r1 exhibits similar properties to those of run d3 and d4 as a result of its ability to heat the gas efficiently through the runaway stars .",
    "our simulations suggest that the effects of feedback are more relevant for the galaxy morphology than in massive systems .",
    "the main effects are _ galaxy outflows and a trend to form a significant extended stellar spheroid with an approximately exponential surface density profile_. what is the origin of this stellar halo ?",
    "since the dark matter halo under study evolves in a quiet fashion , at least from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , without experimenting major mergers , a significant fraction of the stellar particles of this extended spheroid were born in situ and _ not by mergers _ as it is expected for large galaxies .",
    "this is confirmed by our analysis of tracing back in time the position of the stellar particles in order to infer their origin .",
    "recently , @xcite have also reported the formation of old extended exponential stellar halos in their simulations of dwarf  like galaxies in isolated ( without mergers ) halos .",
    "as these authors review , observations show that dwarf galaxies are characterized by extended exponential old / intermedium age stellar halos .",
    "a recent study of lsb galaxies with the stacked image technique has also shown the existence of red faint stellar halos around lsb galaxies @xcite , galaxies that are supposed to form typically in isolated environments .",
    "it is worth noticing that the r runs ( those with a stochastic sf model ) , with the exception of r2 , produce more massive and extended stellar halos than the d runs ( those with deterministic sf model ) , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : surfdensity ] .",
    "the parameters of the sf / feedback prescriptions used here were shown to affect significantly the evolution and properties of the modeled low  mass galaxy .",
    "the change of these parameters affects in a complex and non  linear way the evolution and properties of the system .",
    "we note that even the evolution of the dark matter mass and angular momentum distributions is different for different combinations of the sf / feedback parameters , confirming the existence of a _ tight evolutionary interconnection between baryons and dark matter _",
    "( see for recent results , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the internal distribution of the angular momentum evolves in our simulations , as can be seen , in particular , by changes in the dark halo and baryonic galaxy specific angular momentum ratio .",
    "we suggest that our finding that the baryon specific angular momentum can be larger than the one in the dark halo , deserves further future exploration .    in order to obtain a not too concentrated low  mass galaxy , with a nearly flat rotation curve , multi ",
    "phase ism , and an extended and episodic sfh , an efficient stellar feedback is necessary ( in our case , switching off radiative cooling in the star forming region by 40 myrs ) .",
    "however , the sf parameters are also important ; for the resolution we have attained in our simulations ( nominally 218 comoving pc ) , effective values for the density threshold @xmath167 are recommended .",
    "we say ` effective ' because in the stochastic ( random ) sf scheme the reported @xmath3 is just the minimum value , larger values of @xmath3 are actually chosen , and sf proceeds with a probability distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_sf ] ) . as in previous related numerical treatments of the galaxy problem",
    ", we conclude that sub  grid physics needs to be carefully addressed ( tuned ) in order to obtain reasonably realistic galaxy properties .      despite that several of the runs",
    "presented here predict realistic properties , we note that the circular velocity curves are decreasing for all the cases studied here , while in observed low ",
    "mass galaxies the trend is to have an increasing _ rotation curve _ up to the last measured radii ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* but see swaters et al .",
    "however , the average rotational velocity profile does not trace necessarily the circular velocity and at least in model r2 the rotational velocity , of the gas at @xmath125 k , increases as observed in low - mass galaxies .",
    "similar situations have been discussed by @xcite as a result of pressure gradients and non - circular motions .",
    "the mismatch between circular and rotation velocity deserves further exploration in future papers exploring also effects of resolution .    also , our simulated galaxies show baryonic mass fractions that are too high compared with observational inferences . for example , in the simulation where galaxy outflows are most effective ( run d4 ) , @xmath168 ( at @xmath17 ) is only a factor 2.5 lower than the universal baryon fraction @xmath169 , while the observational inferences suggest that present ",
    "day galaxies of low masses have baryon fractions more than a factor of 5 smaller than @xmath169 .",
    "our results confirm that _ producing a stellar feedback that is sufficiently efficient as to eject considerable amounts of gas from even low  mass galaxies is not an easy task _ ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "even more , the problem of producing strong enough outflows is probably in opposition with other potential vexing conflict .",
    "an increasing amount of local and high  redshift observational evidence shows that the less massive the galaxies , the higher their current specific sfrs ( ssfr = sfr/@xmath103 ) on average at all redshifts back to @xmath170 , a phenomenon dubbed as ` downsizing in ssfr ' @xcite .",
    "moreover , the observational inferences show that the problem is not that massive disk galaxies have low ssfrs but that low  mass galaxies have too high ssfrs ( see for a discussion * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such ssfrs imply that low  mass galaxies should delay the formation of stars and do it with a nearly constant or even increasing sfrs @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath152 decreases as the galaxy mass decreases , then obtaining late , high ssfrs in these galaxies becomes even more difficult . as concluded in (",
    "* see also somerville et al .",
    "2008 and fontanot et al .",

    "the cosmological numerical simulations presented here confirm the sharpness of both potential problems . _",
    "the baryon fractions of the simulated low ",
    "mass galaxies are too high and their ssfrs are in all cases much smaller than the average values of the observational inferences at redshifts @xmath9_. the run with the highest ssfrs is d3 : ssfr = 0.17 , 0.06 gyr@xmath138 at @xmath16 , 0.43 , respectively .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig . 1 in firmani et al .",
    "most of the other runs have ssfrs much smaller than those of run d3 .",
    "our simulations also show that if @xmath152 is reduced by strong feedback  driven outflows , then the late - time ssfr decreases .",
    "run d4 indeed has fewer baryons owing to the strong outflows , but also a much lower ssfr than run d3 .",
    "a related problem to the low ssfrs is that _ the gas fractions of the simulated galaxies ( for example at @xmath2 ) are in most cases too low _",
    "( see table [ tab : bfract ] ) . among runs r2r4 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath150 is 0.075 for run r2 ; among runs d2 d4 , as expected by its ssfr history , run d3 has the largest value , @xmath173 , which is still marginal compared with the large gas fractions of observed present  day low  mass galaxies .",
    "they should have large gas reservoirs to produce the high ssfrs infered from observations .",
    "if the baryon fraction and ssfr problems for low  mass galaxies are confirmed , models for sf / feedback very different to the one applied here and in other works should be proposed to agree with observations , preserving the underlying  cosmogony .",
    "it is possible that significant changes to the galaxy assembly process can be introduced alternatively by improving the physics of the poorly understood circumgalactic and intergalactic media .",
    "finally , we should say that the current observational inferences , specially at high redshifts , are still plagued by large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "a comparison of simulation outcomes at @xmath1 with the more accurate observations of present  day galaxies is desirable in order to asses the severity of the problems mentioned above .",
    "we plan to do this in a forthcoming paper .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the sub - grid prescriptions in our simulations are certainly not complete , as several physical ingredients that could be important for the evolution of real galaxies are missing . in particular , our simulations do not include the magnetic field nor cosmic ray pressure , and they do not resolve the whole plethora of phenomena that occur at the scales of molecular clouds , including turbulence and other forms of stellar feedback additional to supernova explosions , such as bipolar outflows and the expansion of hii around massive stars .",
    "all of these agents contribute to drive the turbulence at scales that are unresolved in our simulations , whose effect may be to reduce the star formation efficiency in the simulations @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is expected to have a similar effect @xcite .",
    "note that , in a sense , this is what we are accomplishing in our simulations by turning off the local cooling after a star formation event , since the hotter gas is less prone to forming stars .",
    "however , future studies will need to quantify these effects so that they can be incorporated in a suitable sub - grid model applicable for galaxy - formation simulations .",
    "by means of high  resolution amr hydrodynamic simulations ( the hydrodynamics + n - body art code ) , we have explored the formation and evolution of a galaxy within a low mass halo ( @xmath174 at @xmath1 ) assembled in the context of the  cosmogony .",
    "the dm particle mass of the least massive species is @xmath175 .",
    "our main aim was to explore the formation of a low  mass galaxy in cosmological simulations with _ the same initial conditions _ but varying the most relevant parameters of the sf and feedback recipes .",
    "the analysis presented herein was mainly made at two epochs , @xmath75 and 0.43 , a time period of 3.2 gyr for the used cosmology . from this exploratory study not exaustive in any sense",
    "we remark the following systematic results :    - the sf density threshold @xmath3 is a relevant parameter in the simulations , which affects the main structural and dynamical properties of the stellar and gaseous components of the low  mass galaxies , as well as their sfhs and general ism properties . as @xmath3 is decreased , ( a ) the stellar galaxy size ( @xmath176 ) increases ; ( b ) the @xmath7 profile becomes less peaked ; ( c )",
    "the peak in the sfh is delayed and the late ( nearly exponential ) decline in sfr becomes more gradual ; ( d ) the stellar populations are younger on average , with a thicker disk and a larger fraction of stars in a `` puffier '' , spheroidal component ; ( e ) the low  density and high  temperature gas in the disk increases .",
    "for a cell of 150 pc , close to our nominal resolution at @xmath1 , we estimate from typical ism properties that @xmath3 should be @xmath177 .",
    "- the stellar particle mass limit , @xmath39 , affects the efficiency of sn energy dumping into the cell . for high values of @xmath39 , the feedback ",
    "driven disk outflows increase and the sfh of the simulated galaxy becomes burstier .",
    "- an effective stellar feedback ( generated by turning off locally the cooling by 40 myr after sf ) has a strong effect on our studied low - mass galaxy : the stellar radius @xmath176 increases by a factor of @xmath8 , the galaxy becomes less concentrated , and @xmath7 becomes flatter .",
    "a strong feedback produces also an episodic sfh .",
    "its action also favors the development of a complex multi  phase disk ism and a self  regulated sf process , but if it is too strong , the low  density , warm / hot gas can be completely blown out from the disk .",
    "- for all of our runs , both at @xmath16 and 0.43 , we find that the relation between  and  is steeper than empirical determinations for normal disk galaxies , but in agreement with recent determinations for lsb galaxies , which are typically of low mass .",
    "nevertheless the effective stellar surface densities , @xmath178 , of our models are instead in the high  density side of the observed distributions at @xmath106 and 1 .    - in all runs",
    ", the stellar galaxy has a significant extended spheroidal component ( between @xmath111 and @xmath179 of @xmath103 at @xmath17 ) with a nearly exponential surface density profile .",
    "we have seen that an important fraction of the stars in this halo were formed in situ , while a minor fraction may come from minor merger events .",
    "- the variation of the parameters of the sf / feedback prescriptions affects in a complex and non  linear way the evolution of the galaxy system .",
    "even the evolution of the dark mass and angular momentum distributions change as these parameters are changed , confirming the tight interconnection between baryons and dark matter .",
    "for example , the internal distribution of am evolves in our simulations and this evolution is sensitive to the sf / feedback physics .",
