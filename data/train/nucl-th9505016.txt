    "the main purpose of relativistic heavy - ion collisions at future rhic and lhc energies is to create in the laboratory a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and to study its properties . on the other hand , for heavy - ion collisions at brookhaven s",
    "ags the emphasis has been in studying the properties of hot dense hadronic matter and the collision dynamics .",
    "however , the possibility of a phase transition to the qgp in central heavy - ion collisions at ags energies has also been mentioned recently .    at ags , a vast body of data",
    "have already been collected and analysed during past few years@xcite .",
    "comparisons of these data with the predictions from theoretical models , such as the rqmd @xcite , the arc@xcite , and the qgsm@xcite , have revealed much interesting physics .",
    "in particular , a picture of nearly complete stopping of baryons in central heavy - ion collisions has emerged from these studies .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that baryon and energy densities up to 10 times that in normal nuclei have been reached in these collisions , leading thus to the suggestion that in central collisions at ags energies the qgp may have already been formed @xcite .",
    "it has been further shown , based on a relativistic nucleation theory , that perhaps one in every @xmath0 or @xmath1 events undergoes the phase transition .",
    "however , the above suggestion and many other exotic phenomena depend crucially on the maximum energy and baryon densities reached in the collision . in this paper",
    ", we will carry out a detailed study on the formation of a superdense hadronic matter in heavy ion collisions at ags energies .    with the available au beam at @xmath2=11.6 gev / c at ags , more systematic study of heavy - ion collisions",
    "are being carried out by several collaboration ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , systematic and exclusive measurements of the energy and mass dependence of particle production , correlations and collective flow effects from bevalac energies up to ags energies will soon be carried out by the eos collaboration@xcite .",
    "besides studying possible new physical phenomena , these experiments will provide a broader base of data so that more stringent tests of theoretical models can be made .",
    "also , comparisons of the experimental data with reliable model predictions will allow us to learn about the properties of hot dense hadronic matter formed in these collisions and help identify new physical phenomena .",
    "stimulated by the success of the rqmd and the arc in describing many available experimental data at ags energies , we have recently developed a relativistic transport ( art ) model for heavy - ion collisions at these energies .",
    "a brief report of the model has been given in refs.@xcite , here we will present the detail of the model ( art 1.0 ) and study several important aspects and issues of heavy - ion collisions at ags energies .",
    "more specifically , we discuss in section ii the detail of the model art 1.0 and its inputs . in section iii , we first study the general heavy ion collision dynamics at ags energies .",
    "we then discuss the formation of the superdense hadronic matter and its properties as well as its dependence on the equation of state .",
    "the degree of thermal equilibrium in the superdense hadronic matter and the time scale involved are also discussed .",
    "in addition , main features of the radial flow during the expansion phase , the flow velocity profile and temperature of the hadronic matter at freeze - out are also investigated .",
    "the model is then used to study the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of protons , pions and kaons with and without including the mean field in order to identify observables that are sensitive to the equation of state .",
    "these results are then compared with each other and also with the preliminary data from the e866/e802 collaboration .",
    "finally , we carry out a detailed analysis of the baryon transverse flow in the reaction plane and study its dependence on the equation of state .",
    "the summary and outlook are given in section iv .",
    "those interested only in the results may turn directly to section iii .",
    "based on the well - known boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) model ( e.g. @xcite ) for intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions , we have recently developed a relativistic transport model for heavy ion collisions at ags energies @xcite by including more baryon and meson resonances and their interactions .",
    "the buu model has been very successful in studying heavy - ion collisions at beam energies lower than about 3 gev / nucleon .",
    "we refer the reader to the review by bertsch and das gupta for more details of the buu model@xcite .    in the art model",
    ", we have kept the same philosophy and methods as in the buu model , but added some new physics and numerical techniques in order to simulate heavy - ion collisions at higher energies .",
    "more specifically , we have included in art 1.0 the following baryons : @xmath3 , and mesons : @xmath4 , as well as their explicit isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "although antiparticles and heavier mesons have so far not been included , their production can be studied perturbatively in the present version of the model .",
    "we plan to include explicitly these particles in an upgraded version of the model .",
    "both elastic and inelastic collisions among most of these particles are included as best as we can by using as inputs the experimental data from hadron - hadron collisions . in accordance with this philosophy ,",
    "almost all parameterized cross sections and angular distributions that have been used in the buu model are replaced by empirical expressions based on the double - logarithmic interpolations of the experimental data@xcite . however , more than 200 reaction channels are listed in the cern data book@xcite for nucleon - nucleon and pion - nucleon collisions .",
    "we certainly have not fully incorporated all these channels . instead , most inelastic hadron - hadron collisions are modeled through the formation of resonances .",
    "the advantage of this approximation is that the finite lifetime of these resonances takes into account partially the effects of the finite formation time for produced secondaries . in the following",
    ", we present details of treating various hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "first of all , we have included in the model the following reactions , @xmath5 and those producing kaons as shown later in eqs .",
    "( [ kaon])-([kaon2 ] ) .",
    "the decomposition of the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section into different channels shown in the above certainly involves some uncertainties and assumptions .",
    "moreover , most of the available data are only for the @xmath6 reaction . for the @xmath7 reaction we use as much data as possible .",
    "otherwise , we just assume that the cross sections are the same as in the @xmath6 reaction . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the methods we have introduced for determining these cross sections .    as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we use the parameterization introduced by verwest et al.@xcite for the cross sections of producing a single @xmath8 or @xmath9 resonance in processes shown in eq .",

    "other quantities in the parameterization are defined as in ref .",

    "( 2 ) are estimated by subtracting from the measured inclusive @xmath21 production cross section in the nucleon - nucleon collision @xcite the contribution from @xmath22 and the @xmath21 decay of the @xmath9 resonance in the @xmath23 reaction .",
    "for example , we have for a @xmath6 collision , @xmath24 we show in fig .  1 the experimental @xmath6 inelastic cross section ( solid line ) together with its decomposition into contributions from the production of various resonances .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath25 gev the contribution from double resonance production , shown by the dotted line , is about one third of the total inelastic cross section .",
    "we have assumed that the double resonance production cross sections are the same for all channels allowed by charge conservation .",
    "this approximation is strongly supported by recent theoretical studies based on the one - boson - exchange model@xcite .",

    ". energies of colliding nucleon pairs in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions at ags energies .",
    "we then attribute the difference between the experimental total nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section and the sum of cross sections from reactions shown in eqs .",

    "the total inelasticity of the nucleon - nucleon collision is properly treated as only a limited , though large , number of reactions have been incorporated .",
    "the errors introduced by this approximation for the quasi-@xmath34 production cross section is small . from fig .",
    "1 , it is seen that the maximum cross section for the process @xmath36 at @xmath37 gev , corresponding to the c.m .",
    "energy of colliding nucleon pairs at a beam momentum of 11.6 gev / c , is about 3.0 mb , which , however , has to be compared with the 13 , 9 and 5 mb for the final states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "cross sections for reactions shown in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) to ( 7 ) are taken to be the same as in the nucleon - nucleon collision having the same center - of - mass energy and total charge .    using the rejection method ,",
    "the masses of @xmath40 and @xmath26 are distributed according to the modified single or joint breit - wigner distributions with momentum - dependent widths . for single resonance production , the cross section can be expressed in terms of the transition matrix element @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the modified breit - wigner function @xmath44 in the above , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the nucleon momenta in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",

    "@xcite , to obtain an accurate resonance mass distribution requires knowledge about the mass dependence of the matrix element . for simplicity , we assume that the matrix element is independent of the mass , and the mass distribution of the resonance is then given by @xmath51 .",

    ", one has the similar expression for the production cross section .",
    "the @xmath26 mass distribution is @xmath58    moreover , in calculating the masses , decay probabilities and formation cross sections of baryon resonances , the following momentum - dependent widths are used , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the nucleon momentum in the rest frame of the resonance with its mass at the centroid .",
    "however , constant widths of 0.151 and 0.0084 gev are used for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the reverse reactions should be treated on the same footing . however , in the present version of the model , we have limited ourselves to only two - body collisions as indicated by the arrows in eqs .",
    "( 1 - 7 ) . in view of the high baryon density reached in heavy - ion collisions at ags energies",
    ", many - body interactions should become increasingly important as the compression gradually increases during the collision .",
    "both the physics and techniques of treating many - body interactions are currently of great intreat but unfortunately without clear solution .",
    "we therefore postpone the inclusion of three - body and possibly many - body collisions to a later version of the model .",
    "cross sections for the two - body reverse reactions are calculated by the detailed balance relation taking into account the finite widths of the resonances . for the absorption of a single resonance @xmath61",
    "we have the cross section @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the spin degeneracy of the resonance @xmath64 .",
    "the factor @xmath65 takes into account the case of having two identical nucleons in the final state . using @xmath66",
    "similarly , for the absorption of two resonances @xmath67 we have @xmath68 the detailed balance relation in this case then reads as @xmath69    limits of the mass integration are given by eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) . in the case ,",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 , the above relations reduce to the standard detailed balance relations for the production and absorption of resonances with fixed masses @xmath72 at ags energies , resonances with large widths can be produced , especially in the early stage of the collisions , it is then necessary to use the detailed balance relations of eqs .",
    "( [ det1 ] ) and ( [ det2 ] ) to treat their annihilation .",
    "one can also separate meson - baryon interactions into the elastic and inelastic parts . for the elastic interaction ,",
    "we treat them via the formation of baryon resonances , @xmath73 as well as direct reactions , @xmath74    the standard breit - wigner form@xcite of resonance formation in meson - nucleon interactions can be rewritten as @xmath75 where @xmath60 is the meson momentum at the centroid @xmath49 of the resonance mass distribution .",
    "the mass @xmath76 of the produced baryon resonance is uniquely determined by reaction kinematics .",
    "the maximum cross sections are given by @xmath77 in evaluating @xmath78 , we have taken into account properly the decay branching ratios of the @xmath12 and @xmath79 resonances .    the formation of the three baryon resonances in the reactions shown in eq .",
    "( [ fres ] ) accounts almost entirely the @xmath80 elastic cross sections at low energies .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  3 and fig .  4 where the experimental cross sections for the elastic scattering of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are compared with the sum of the three baryon resonance formation cross sections .",
    "it is also seen from the figures that the formation of the @xmath8 resonance alone is not enough to describe even the low energy part of @xmath80 scattering . at higher energies ,",
    "the elastic cross section is mainly due to the formation of higher resonances which are not included in the present version of the model .",
    "we therefore attribute the difference between the experimental elastic cross section and the contribution from the three lowest baryon resonances to the direct process @xmath83 . the contribution from direct @xmath80 scattering",
    "is shown by the dotted lines in fig .  3 and fig .  4 .",
    "the experimentally unknown cross sections , such as those for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 reactions , are calculated by using a resonance model that includes heavier baryon resonances with masses up to about 2.0 gev . neglecting interferences between resonances , one has @xmath87 the pre - factor 1.3 is introduced so that the high energy part of @xmath88 data can be fitted and is mainly due to the neglect of interferences .",

    "for the @xmath94 scattering a constant cross section of 10 mb is used according to the available data .",
    "the decay of resonances , such as @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , during each time step @xmath100 are treated by the monte carlo method .",

    "namely , @xmath103 for @xmath104 , otherwise @xmath105 . for the @xmath79 resonance",
    "we use @xmath106 .",
    "finally , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are allowed to decay into a nucleon and a pion only at the very end of the reaction .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the bose - einstein enhancement factor @xmath109 for a pion in the final state has not been included in meson+nucleon collisions and decays of resonances .",
    "this is certainly another aspect to be improved in a later version of the model in view of the high pion densities reached in heavy - ion collisions at ags energies .",
    "the @xmath80 inelastic collision starts at @xmath110 gev due to the @xmath111 final state .",
    "as the energy increases the number of final state quickly increases to the order of 200 .",
    "most inelastic reactions lead to pion and kaon production .",
    "the final states can also consist of baryon and meson resonances . to treat the inelastic reactions in a numerically tractable way , we model them through the production of @xmath112 and @xmath27 resonances , i.e. , @xmath113 and those producing kaons shown later in eq .",
    "( [ kaon1 ] ) . we have thus included only final states with at most 4 quasipions .",
    "again , the above decomposition of the cross sections involves some uncertainties and approximations .",
    "however , as we will discuss later our final results are not sensitive to them due to the large number of final - state interactions .    for two and three pion production in @xmath80 collisions",
    ", we assume that they are mainly through the production of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "for example , for the @xmath114 final state in the @xmath82 interaction , we use @xmath116 and for the @xmath115 final state , we use @xmath117 the difference between the experimental total @xmath80 inelastic cross section and the cross sections for producing @xmath114 , @xmath115 and kaons are then attributed to the production of @xmath118 , i.e. , @xmath119 as an example , the decomposition of the inelastic @xmath82 cross section is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the cross sections for having 2 , 3 and 4 quasipions are comparable at @xmath120 gev , but at higher energies the @xmath34 channel dominates . as we shall see later",
    ", the distribution of meson+baryon center of mass energies peaks at about @xmath121 gev in the reaction of au+au at @xmath122= 11.6 gev / c and falls off very quickly towards @xmath120 gev .",
    "it thus makes us feel rather confident that the errors introduced in the quasi-@xmath34 channel in our previous decomposition is very small .",
    "the two - body reverse reactions of the @xmath80 inelastic collisions are similarly treated as for the two - body reverse reactions of the inelastic baryon - baryon collisions .",
    "we model pion - pion elastic collisions through the formation of a @xmath26 meson , i.e. , @xmath123 , and the direct process @xmath124 .",
    "the latter takes into account the case when the quantum numbers of colliding pions forbid the formation of a @xmath125 meson @xmath26 .    in terms of the channel isospin cross sections",
    "@xmath126 with @xmath127=0 , 1 , and 2 , one finds using the glebsch - gordan coefficients the following isospin decomposition of @xmath128 scattering cross sections @xmath129 because of the symmetrization of two - pion states , only even partial waves are allowed for @xmath130 and @xmath131 and odd partial waves for @xmath132 .",
    "low energy @xmath128 scattering are therefore described by the three partial - wave cross sections @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the formation of a @xmath26 resonance has thus the probability @xmath135 while the direct @xmath136 reaction has the probability of @xmath137 .",
    "the partial wave cross sections @xmath138 are related to the phase shift @xmath139 via @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the momentum of the pion in the center - of - mass of the two pions .",

    "we use the approximation that the kaon production cross sections in reactions induced by resonances are the same as in nucleon - nucleon collisions at the same center - of - mass energy which are mainly taken from the data compilation of refs .  @xcite .",
    "since the experimental data on kaon production are very limited , we use only the isospin - averaged cross sections . based on the one - pion exchange model",

    "this is probably a resonable , minimal assumption one can make .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that theoretical efforts have recently been made to calculate these unknown cross sections ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and we plan to incorporate these results in future versions of the art model .",

    "frame shows little change in the final kaon distribution in heavy - ion collisions as a result of kaon final - state interactions .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that in reactions @xmath169 and @xmath170 , which are dominated by one - pion exchange , the pion can be on - shell .",
    "the latter contribution is equivalent to a two - step process , i.e. , a resonance decaying into a physical pion and a nucleon , and the subsequent production of a kaon from the pion - baryon interaction . to avoid double counting",
    ", one can follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite by including only the reactions @xmath169 and @xmath170 but not the reaction @xmath171 .",
    "this requires , however , a model for the reactions @xmath169 and @xmath170 . in the present paper ,",
    "we use instead the assumption that the cross sections for the reactions @xmath169 and @xmath170 due to off - shell pions are the same as in @xmath172 reaction at the same center - of - mass energy , which invloves only an off - shell pion .",
    "then , we should include both the reactions @xmath169 and @xmath170 and the reactions @xmath171 in the transport model .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the method we use to determine the final particle momenta in a hadron - hadron collision , which does not involve kaons , in principle , to determine the momentum of a particle in a multiparticle production process , one needs to know the interaction matrix element which is model - dependent . for simplicity ,",
    "we determine the momentum distribution of the produced particles according to the phase space . besides imposing the energy - momentum conservation",
    ", we also make use of the systematics observed in multiparticle production processes .",
    "these systematics are often given by empirical formula that are fitted to the inclusive data .",
    "an important feature of energetic hadron - hadron collisions is the `` leading '' particle behaviour . in our model",
    "this is ensured by requiring the outgoing baryons to have the same or similar identities as the incident ones so that their longitudinal directions are retained when performing the momentum transformation from the baryon - baryon c.m .",

    "moreover , baryons in the final state of an energetic hadron - hadron collision have a typical forward - backward peaked angular distribution and a soft transverse momentum distribution .",

    "this distribution is shown in fig .  9 , and it is seen that the forward - backward peaked angular distribution becomes almost energy independent for @xmath183 gev . this tendency is consistent with the systematics found in @xmath6 collisions at high energies where the inclusive proton spectra can be well described by @xcite @xmath184 with @xmath185 being the scaled longitudinal momentum in the c.m .",

    "the solid line is a plot of the proton transverse momentum distribution from eq .",
    "( [ dis1 ] ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is reasonably good although there is still some room at low transverse momenta for further improvement .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution has a very similar behaviour . with the above transverse momentum distribution for baryons and employing the assumption that all resonances decay isotropically in their rest frames we obtain the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath192 as shown in the lower window of fig .",
    "the @xmath193 transverse momentum distribution is then seen to fit reasonably well the empirical formula , @xmath194 of ranft el al@xcite for high energy @xmath6 collisions . for comparisons ,",
    "we have also shown in fig .",
    "10 the generated proton and @xmath192 transverse momentum distributions from @xmath6 collisions at @xmath195 gev / c .",
    "they , of course , do not agree with the scaling formula valid at high energies .",
    "the above procedure makes us feel confident about our model for high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we remark here , however , that there is no direct , transparent extrapolation from @xmath196 , @xmath197 to @xmath198 collisions .",
    "the dynamics and the final momentum distributions of hadrons in heavy - ion collisions are rather sensitive to the modeling or prescription of individual hadron - hadron scattering , besides the elementary momentum distributions discussed above .",
    "the nuclear equation of state describes the response of the nuclear matter to changes in excitation energies and densities .",
    "current knowledge on the nuclear equation of state is restricted to a narrow region around the ground state .",
    "extending our knowledge about the nuclear equation of state to different densities and/or excitation energies has been a major goal of nuclear physics .",
    "mean - field effects have already been found to be important in heavy - ion collisions at medium energies . at higher energies such as at ags , they have been ignored in arc , for example .",
    "we believe that the mean - field potential is not negligible in heavy - ion collisions at ags energies .",
    "although the forward scattering amplitudes of hadron - hadron collisions in the high energy limit have been found approximately purely imaginary@xcite , the ags energies may not be high enough for the real part of the scattering amplitude to completely vanish .",
    "of course , the form and strength of the mean field in hot dense hadronic matter is uncertain and has been a subject of many discussions .",
    "secondly , although in the early stage of the collision the kinetic energy is much higher than the potential energy , particles are gradually slowed down and the mean field is expected to play an increasingly important role as the collision proceeds . in particular , the repulsive mean field in the high density region tends to keep particles from coming close and therefore reduces the maximum energy and baryon densities reached in the collision should there be no mean field .",
    "moreover , in the expansion phase of the collision mean - field effects become even stronger .",
    "it is therefore essential to study how the collision dynamics is affected by the nuclear mean field .",
    "of course , the most challenging task is to identify the experimentally observable consequences of the nuclear mean field , so the information about the nuclear equation of state can be obtained .    without much reliable knowledge about the equation of state in hot dense medium ,",
    "we use here the simple , skyrme - type parameterization for the mean field which has been widely used in heavy - ion collisions at and below bevalac energies , @xmath199 the corresponding energy per nucleon in nuclear matter at zero temperature is given by @xmath200 where @xmath201=37.26 mev is the fermi energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath202 is negative , @xmath203 is positive and @xmath204 is larger than one reflecting the fact that the nucleon - nucleon interaction has a short - range repulsive part and a long - range attractive part . by fitting to the ground state properties of nuclear matter",
    "the three parameters are determined in terms of the compressibility coefficient @xmath205 as @xmath206 the compressibility coefficient @xmath205 can also be expressed in terms of @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 , i.e. , @xmath207    an important constraint on the nuclear equation of state in hot dense medium is imposed by the causality@xcite . for nuclear matter at zero temperature the adiabatic sound velocity is @xmath208.\\ ] ] the causal requirement @xmath209 limits the density range applicable for a given parameter set . in fig .",
    "11 , we show the adiabatic sound velocity and the energy per nucleon as functions of density for the two equations of state corresponding to @xmath205=377 mev ( @xmath2102 , stiff ) and 201 mev ( @xmath211 , soft ) .",
    "it is seen that the stiff and soft equations of state violate the causality beyond densities @xmath212 and @xmath213 , respectively . at finite temperatures",
    "the critical densities are reduced by less than one density unit@xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall use the soft equation of state , and the stiff equation of station will only be mentioned for the purpose of discussions .",
    "the mean - field potentials for baryon resonances are likely to be different from that of nucleons .",
    "resonance potentials have been studied previously @xcite and are still less uncertain@xcite than the nucleon potential .",
    "for example , significant efforts have been devoted to understanding the effects of the @xmath8 potential on the nuclear matter saturation properties@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 optical potential has also been studied in charge - exchange reactions @xcite , electron and @xmath214 induced reactions@xcite as well as @xmath215-nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "all studies indicate that the shape of the @xmath8 potential is very similar to the nucleon potential , probably a little deeper than the nucleon potential .",
    "the exact form of the @xmath8 potential somehow depends on the momentum and density .",
    "current theories give a large range of model parameters for the @xmath8 potential , and they often have conflicting features . in view of the larger uncertainties associated with resonance potentials , we assume here that they are the same as the nucleon potential .    since a large number of baryon resonances",
    "are produced in heavy - ion collisions at ags energies , the reaction dynamics might be significantly affected by the resonance potentials .",
    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions may therefore provide valuable information about the resonance potentials",
    ". however , this can only be possible if other details of the collision dynamics are well understood .",
    "the present work is thus also useful in this respect .",
    "we first discuss the range of beam energies in which the model outlined above is applicable . in the energy range of @xmath216 gev / a",
    ", our model , as many other nuclear transport models , is able to describe many aspects of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these include the emission of light particles , the creation of pions , kaons and etas as well as the transverse collective flow of various hadrons@xcite .",
    "since the particle production mechanism used in the model is exclusively based on the excitation and decay of several low - mass baryon and meson resonances , the model is expected to be inadequate once the energy is above about @xmath217 gev . at higher energies , such as the sps / cern energies , heavier resonances and more importantly the formation and fragmentation of strings and ropes",
    "are expected to be the dominant mechanisms for particle production @xcite .",
    "the model art 1.0 is designed intentionally to be most applicable in heavy - ion collisions below the ags energies . as in other hadronic models ,",
    "our model is naturally limited only to interactions among hadrons . if there were a phase transition to the qgp at ags , hadronic models , such as the present one , are still useful as their predictions provide the background against which new physical phenomena can be identified .",
    "in fact , one of the motivations for the present work is to study whether and how conditions for forming the quark - gluon plasma can be achieved in heavy - ion collisions at beam energies from 2 gev / nucleon up to ags energies .",
    "moreover , hadronic models are useful for studying in - medium properties of hadrons .",
    "theoretical studies ( e.  g.  @xcite ) have shown that the properties of hadrons , such as the mass and decay width , may be modified in hot dense hadronic matter as a result of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry . in the following",
    ", we shall apply the present model to study several general , but important aspects and issues of heavy - ion collisions at ags energies .",
    "in the subsequent work we plan to study among many other subjects : ( i ) the effects of changing hadron properties in hot dense medium on heavy - ion collision dynamics and , in particular , on the production of exotic particles , ( ii ) the beam energy dependence of the collision dynamics from 2 gev / nucleon up to ags energies which will be carried out experimentally by the eos collaboration , and ( iii ) the role of quark and gluon degrees of freedom at high densities and the study of physics related to the phase transition to the qgp .      to study the reaction dynamics of central heavy - ion collisions at ags energies , we shall first study in this section the reaction rates of various hadron - hadron collisions . to avoid the complexity introduced by the mean field",
    ", we shall use the cascade mode of art .",
    "in particular , we shall consider head - on collisions of au+au at @xmath2=11.6 gev / c as an example for discussions .",
    "12 shows the reaction rates of nucleon - nucleon scattering to the following final states @xmath218 and @xmath219 where @xmath220 denotes baryon resonances @xmath221 or @xmath79 . as one would expect from the decomposition of the total inelastic cross sections discussed in the previous section , the rate of the quasi-3@xmath215 channel is the highest at the very beginning of the reaction when @xmath222 fm / c , but is closely followed by the quasi-2@xmath215 and quasi-1@xmath215 channels . since particles loses their energies after several collisions the single baryon resonance production soon becomes dominant .",
    "the collision rates for producing @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , however , about an order of magnitude smaller than the quasi-4@xmath215 channel .",
    "most collisions cease after about 10 fm / c except the single - resonance production channel @xmath223 which lasts a little longer . for comparison ,",
    "it is worth noting that the maximum reaction rate reached in the collision is about an order of magnitude higher than that in heavy - ion collisions at bevalac and sis / gsi energies@xcite .",
    "the rescattering or absorption of produced baryon resonances and mesons are very important in heavy - ion reactions at ags energies . in fig .",
    "13 we show the reaction rates for nucleon+resonance , resonance+resonance and meson+meson scattering .",
    "it is seen that the nucleon+resonance scattering start earlier and dominate during most of the collision time .",
    "the meson+meson and resonance+resonance rescattering start later as it takes some time to create these secondary particles .",
    "after about 10 fm / c the nucleon+resonance and resonance+resonance scattering are almost over .",
    "one also notices that meson+meson scattering last longer mainly due to the large @xmath224 elastic cross section , although the rate decreases towards the later time of the collision .",
    "all these features are what one would expect and easily understandable .",
    "the relatively low rate for baryon resonance+baryon resonance collisions needs , however , some explanations .",
    "the most important reason is that the final states in resonance+resonance collisions are limited only to @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 in the present version of the model , instead of allowing for the production of up to 4 quasipions as in nucleon+nucleon collisions .",
    "in addition , due to the large spin degeneracy in the initial state , the cross sections obtained from the detailed balance relation for the @xmath228 reactions are relatively small compared to their reverse reactions .    in fig .",
    "14 , we show the decay rate of baryon resonances together with their formation rate from @xmath80 collisions .",
    "an interesting feature of these rates is that they last a longer time than hadron+hadron collisions due to the large meson+baryon cross sections .",
    "another feature is that the small difference between the rates of decay and formation of baryon resonances makes the apparent lifetimes of these resonances much longer than their lifetimes in free space .",
    "this is rather clear from the evolution of the pion and baryon resonance multiplicities shown in fig .",
    "it is also seen that about half of the baryons are in their excited states at about 4 fm / c , which is the instant of the highest compression as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the abundance of baryon resonances is dominated by @xmath229 resonances as one would expect in this energy range .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the population of @xmath12 and @xmath18 resonances is also significant .",
    "these higher resonances serve as an energy reservoir and thus play an important role in the production of particles , especially those having higher energy thresholds@xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the number of pion - like particles ( free pions + baryon and meson resonances ) is about the same as the initial number of resonances at the time of maximum compression .    in fig .",
    "16 , we show the time integrated total number of hadron - hadron collisions as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath146 of the colliding pairs for @xmath230 and @xmath231 collisions , where the meson+baryon ( @xmath232 ) and meson+meson ( @xmath233 ) collisions include contributions from both baryon and meson resonances .",
    "it is seen that @xmath234 collisions start at about @xmath235 gev and peak at about @xmath236 gev .",
    "the peak is mainly due to the large number of elastic scattering .",
    "the position of the peak shifts to higher energies and its hight decreases substantially in @xmath237 and @xmath238 reactions .",
    "the reasons are mainly the following .",
    "first of all , we have assumed that the elastic cross sections for @xmath237 and @xmath238 collisions are the same as for @xmath234 collisions at the same center - of - mass energy @xmath146 .",
    "since the elastic cross section decreases quickly as the center - of - mass energy increases , the heavier masses of the baryon resonances then result in smaller elastic cross sections for @xmath237 and @xmath238 collisions .",
    "in addition , as we have mentioned earlier , the number of final states in @xmath237 and @xmath238 collisions are reduced compared to that in @xmath234 collisions . for meson+baryon reactions ,",
    "the collision number distribution have two distinct peaks at @xmath239 gev and @xmath240 gev , respectively .",
    "the first peak apparently corresponds to the formation of the @xmath229 resonance , while the second peak has contributions also from the @xmath241 resonance and direct @xmath242 collisions .",
    "the meson+meson collision number has a peak at about the @xmath26 mass @xmath2430.77 gev .",
    "the above examination on the collision dynamics indicates that the model is working well under control , regardless of the question whether some of the assumptions made in the model can be improved .",
    "this gives us further confidence about the model .",
    "depending on the nature of the quark - gluon plasma phase transition at high baryon densities , the crossover energy between the hadronic and quark - gluon phases may occur anywhere between @xmath244 gev@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out recently that the current au+au reactions at 11.6 gev / c may have already overshot the transition region@xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to critically examine the baryon , meson and energy densities reached in these collisions . in this section ,",
    "we study the local baryon , meson and energy densities in head - on collisions of au+au at @xmath24511.6 gev .",
    "it will be shown that in these collisions a superdense hadronic matter with a density higher than the critical density for the phase transition can be formed in a sufficiently large volume and for a sufficiently long time .",
    "we will also study the dependence of the size and lifetime of the superdense hadronic matter on the nuclear mean field .",
    "the standard test particle method@xcite is used to calculate the global density @xmath246 in the nucleus - nucleus c.m .",
    "frame on a lattice of size @xmath247 with a volume of 1 @xmath248 for each cell . in the test particle method ,",
    "one replaces the continuous phase space distribution function with a finite number of test particles representing individual phase space cells , i.e. @xmath249 where @xmath250 and @xmath251 are the coordinates and momenta of the test particles .",
    "@xmath252 is the number of test particles per nucleon , we usually use @xmath253 for au+au collisions .",
    "the global baryon , meson and energy density function @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 are evaluated via @xmath257 in the last equation , @xmath258 runs over all particles with fixed masses while @xmath259 runs over all particles with variable masses .",
    "the local baryon , meson and energy densities in each cell are then obtained from @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 , where @xmath214 is the lorentz factor of each cell , @xmath263 in the above , @xmath258 runs over all particles in the cell . for most parts of the colliding nuclei",
    ", the use of local densities can eliminate the trivial compression effects due to the initial lorentz contraction of the two nuclei .",
    "however , in the most central cell where the two nuclei are in touch and streaming towards each other , the @xmath214 factor is almost 1 .",
    "therefore , we have at the very beginning of the collision , @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the center of mass lorentz factor of the colliding nuclei , and for au+au at @xmath266 gev / c , one has @xmath267 .",
    "fortunately , this initial high baryon density is only in a very small region at the very beginning and is soon destroyed by the violent collisions that follow . in the cascade model calculations , the initial high baryon density in the most central cell is simply a matter of presentation . for calculations including the density - dependent mean field we have found from comparisons with calculations using the scalar density that the initial high baryon density has no effects on the collision dynamics and the final observables .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "17 the evolution of the local baryon density distribution in the reaction plane using the cascade mode of art 1.0 for the head - on collision of au+au at @xmath122=11.6 gev / c .",
    "the outmost contour is for @xmath268 , and the numbers in the figure are the densities of the corresponding contours in units of @xmath269 .",
    "the two lorentz contracted nuclei are set in touch at t=0 .",
    "it is seen that the initial high density region bounded by the contour with @xmath270 is very small .",
    "the two nuclei soon form a compressed disk and reach the maximum compression of about @xmath271 at about 4 fm / c .",
    "the compressed hadronic matter then starts to expand at about 6 fm / c .",
    "we see that up to 10 fm / c the longitudinal expansion is significantly stronger than the transverse one .",
    "this observation seems to indicate that the isotropically expanding , spherical fireball model widely used for describing heavy - ion collisions at ags energies may need to be improved .",
    "it should be mentioned that the main features observed here are in general agreement with those extracted from the arc calculations@xcite .",
    "the local densities are well defined and are the relevant quantities for discussing the interesting physics of the phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "however , the current model is still not fully relativistically covariant . to estimate the minimum compression reached during the collision for a given system at a fixed beam energy and impact parameter",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "18 the scalar baryon density @xmath272 defined as @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the energy of a baryon . in the limit that the size of each cell is very small such that it can only accommodate one particle the local density becomes equal to the scalar density .",
    "it is seen that the main features in the evolution of the scalar density are similar to those of the local density .",
    "it is interesting to note that the initial high density region around the most central cell in the local density plot does not appear here as one would expect .",
    "we have found that the maximum scalar density reached at 4 fm / c is about @xmath275 which is significantly smaller than the maximum local density reached in the collision .",
    "the local density of mesons ( mostly pions ) can be as high as that of nucleons during the collision .",
    "the evolution of the meson density distribution in the reaction plane is shown in fig .",
    "mesons mainly populate the central region for @xmath276 fm / c , and they spread out quickly soon after that and finally occupy the whole collision volume .",
    "the maximum meson density of about @xmath277 is reached at about 4 fm / c . as we have discussed earlier , at this time about half of final pions",
    "are still bound in resonances .",
    "it is also interesting to see that mesons start to expand earlier and faster than baryons .",
    "after about 8 fm / c , the meson sector of the system has already been expanding almost isotropically . in principle , the geometry and time scale of the expanding hadronic matter studied here can be compared directly with the interferometry measurements to further test the model .",
    "to form a quark - gluon plasma , it is necessary to achieve a high local energy density in a sufficiently large volume and for a sufficiently long time such that the initial plasma droplets can grow . the current estimate for the critical baryon and energy densities at which the qgp may form are about @xmath278 and 2.5 gev/@xmath279 , respectively@xcite . from the above studies on the baryon and meson densities",
    ", we have seen that the superdense hadronic matter occupies a large volume and for a rather long time . as to the possible phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma , more complete and quantitative information about the local energy density of the superdense hadronic matter are needed .",
    "20 shows the evolution of the local energy density in the reaction plane for the head - on collision of au+au at @xmath280 gev / c .",
    "the numbers in the figure are the energy densities in units of gev/@xmath279 .",
    "it is seen that a small , thin disk of energy density higher than 2.5 gev/@xmath279 has already been formed at about 2.0 fm / c .",
    "it grows until about 4 fm / c , then starts to decay , and at about 7 fm / c it disappears due to expansions .",
    "the superdense hadronic matter has thus a lifetime of about 5 fm / c and a maximum volume of about 200 @xmath281 at about 4 fm / c .",
    "the results obtained from the cascade calculations seem to indicate that in head - on collisions of au+au at @xmath2=11.6 gev / c , the conditions for forming a quark - gluon plasma has indeed been reached . however , this also marks the breakdown of the hadronic models and the need to include new degrees of freedom .",
    "it is thus a great challenge to actually convert this superdense hadronic matter into the quark - gluon plasma . without introducing explicitly the quark and gluon degrees of freedom in the model",
    "make this impossible .",
    "nevertheless , before one can study the properties of the quark - gluon plasma , it is necessary to investigate how and to what degree the properties of the superdense hadronic matter may be affected by the nuclear mean field , which is an important piece of physics neglected in cascade calculations . in the following",
    ", we shall compare results obtained with and without the mean field .",
    "first of all , we have found that the general features in the evolution of the baryon , meson and energy density distributions are very similar in the two calculations .",
    "however , important quantitative differences exist .",
    "21 shows the evolution of the local baryon and energy densities in the most central cell during the collision of au+au at @xmath122=11.6 gev / c and b=0 .",
    "results from the cascade calculations are compared with those from calculations using the soft nuclear equation of state with @xmath282 mev and the stiff one with @xmath283 mev . as expected , the mean field has almost no effect in the early stage of the collision when the kinetic energy is much higher than the potential energy .",
    "significant differences appear soon after about 2 fm / c . in the cascade case",
    ", it is seen that a maximum baryon density of about @xmath271 and a maximum energy density of about 3.6 gev/@xmath281 are reached at about 4 fm / c .",
    "the matter in the high energy density region lasts for about 5 fm / c . the volume of the high density region are , however , significantly reduced by the repulsive mean field .",
    "furthermore , the lifetime , maximum baryon and energy densities are reduced to about 3 fm / c , @xmath284 and 2.6 gev/@xmath281 , respectively , when using the soft nuclear equation of state . with the stiff equation of state",
    "the reduction is even larger .",
    "since the stiff equation of state violates causality already at about @xmath285 , we will only use the soft equation of state in the following .",
    "the reduction of the maximum baryon and energy densities due to the mean field may be large enough to affect significantly the collision dynamics .",
    "additional information about the importance of the nuclear mean field can be obtained by comparing the fraction of particles with local energy densities @xmath286 gev/@xmath279 from calculations with and without the mean field .",
    "this is shown in fig .  22 . in the cascade calculation",
    "about 60% of particles are in the high energy density region at the instant of the maximum compression .",
    "the soft equation of state reduces it to about 30% , and this reduction persists during the expansion phase of the collision .      to what degree the superdense hadronic system is thermalized and what is the time scale for achieving thermal equilibrium are among the most important questions in heavy - ion collisions at ags . answers to these questions are useful both for developing static models and for interpreting the experimental data .",
    "for example , in thermodynamic models one usually assumes that there exists a thermalized freeze - out stage when particles in the expanded system cease to strongly interact with each other . in view of the apparent success of the thermodynamical approach ( e.g.  @xcite ) in explaining a large amount of data from heavy - ion collisions at ags energies we study in this section the question of thermalization .",
    "in addition , the large thermal and compressional pressure in the superdense hadronic matter is found to induce a radial flow during the expansion phase .",
    "this is already qualitatively clear from our discussions in the previous section , and we study here more quantitatively the radial flow .",
    "we consider all hadrons in a sphere of radius 2 fm around the origin in the center of mass frame for head - on collisions of au+au at @xmath287 gev / c .",
    "the degree of thermalization can be measured by the ratio @xmath288 then @xmath289 is a necessary , although not a sufficient , condition for thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is also a measure of the stopping power . in the bottom window of fig .",
    "23 , we show this ratio as a function of time .",
    "for all three calculations based on the cascade , the soft and the stiff equation of state , the ratio reaches one at about 10 fm / c . from our early discussions on the reaction rates for various channels , it is clear that this is about the time when most hadronic collisions have stopped .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to use the concept of thermal equilibrium at the time of freeze - out .",
    "it is interesting to note that at about 4 fm / c when the system reaches its maximum compression the ratio r is about 0.7 , indicating that the superdense hadronic system has not reached thermal equilibrium . to estimate the temperature of particles in the above sphere at the time of thermalization",
    ", we show in the middle window the scaled average kinetic energy per particle @xmath290 . at freeze - out",
    ", this quantity can give a good estimate of the temperature . before freeze - out , the evolution of this quantity reflects the collision dynamics .",
    "it is seen that the kinetic energy decreases quickly in the compression phase due to the creation of baryon resonances and other particles as well as various scattering . in the expansion phase",
    ", high energy particles near the surface of the sphere move out continuously due to the radial flow .",
    "the average kinetic energy in the sphere thus gradually decreases in the expanse phase . at the time of freeze - out",
    "this quantity is about 120 mev and slightly depends on the model .",
    "this value is very close to the temperature extracted from the inverse slope of the measured particle spectra .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the time scale for thermalization and the temperature at freeze - out are not very sensitive to the equation of state .",
    "however , the temperature from the cascade is about 30 mev higher than that from calculations with the mean field due to the neglect of the potential energy in the former .    in our calculations ,",
    "the system has undergone sufficient expansion before reaching thermal equilibrium at freeze - out , and this is in agreement with the conclusion reached from studies of the ags data based on the thermodynamical model @xcite .",
    "more quantitative information about the expansion can be seen from the upper window where the number of particles in the central sphere is plotted as a function of time .",
    "general features of this plot are the same as that of the central density plot discussed earlier .",
    "it is seen that the number of particles in the sphere at freeze - out is only about 30% of that at the maximum compression indicating a strong expansion before the freeze - out .",
    "the velocity profile of the radial flow at freeze - out can be expressed by @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the number of particles in a spherical shell of size @xmath293 fm at a radius @xmath294 .",
    "the momentum @xmath295 of each particle has a flow component and a random thermal component @xmath296 in the limit that there are a large number of particles in each shell , the summation in eq .",
    "( [ fl ] ) cancels out the thermal part , i.e. @xmath297 and eq .",
    "( [ fl ] ) reduces thus to the flow velocity @xmath298 , @xmath299 since we usually use a large number of test particles , eq .",
    "( [ fl ] ) gives a good estimate of the radial flow profile . in fig .",
    "24 , we show the estimated flow profile and the corresponding radial density distributions for baryons and pions .",
    "the left window is for the cascade and the right one is for calculations using the soft equation of state .",
    "the radial flow velocity is proportional to the radius , but there seem to be two distinct slopes at radii smaller and larger than about 6 fm .",
    "another interesting feature is that pions seem to flow a little faster than baryons due to their lighter masses .",
    "it is also seen that the difference between the flow profiles from calculations with and without the mean field is rather small , which may indicate that the thermal pressure dominates at freeze - out .",
    "as seen from the upper window , more particles are at larger radii due to the repulsive mean field , so more energy are stored in the radial flow in the case with the mean field .",
    "for comparisons , we mention here that results of a recent hydrodynamical model analysis of a large amount of data from central collisions of si+au at @xmath300 gev / c are consistent with the above discussions . assuming a freeze - out radius of about 7 fm , a freeze - out temperature of 120 ( 140 ) mev and a linear flow velocity profile , the extracted maximum flow velocity is about 0.58 ( 0.5 ) c@xcite , which agrees with the flow profile we have extracted .",
    "the formation of a quark - gluon plasma or a mixed phase of hadrons , quarks and gluons is expected to reduce the pressure of the system and leads to a softened equation of state .",
    "it is therefore interesting to search for experimental observables that are sensitive to the nuclear equation of state . in this section",
    ", we study the sensitivity of inclusive , single particle observables to the equation of state by comparing calculations with and without the mean field .",
    "however , we should mention again that present models for heavy - ion collisions at ags energies are probably inconsistent .",
    "namely , we have shown in the above that the conditions for forming the quark - gluon plasma may have been fulfilled in central collisions at ags energies . without actually including the phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma and the hadronization back to the hadronic phase in the model",
    ", we are limited to discuss only the hadronic physics .",
    "specifically , we shall study the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of protons and pions .",
    "we leave the study of kaon distributions to the next section in central collisions of au+au at @xmath24511.6 gev / c . for references",
    ", we also compare with preliminary data from the e802/e866 collaboration@xcite .",
    "these data were taken using the kinetic energy in the zero degree calorimeter as a trigger on the impact parameter .",
    "the data for central collisions roughly correspond to the upper 4% of the total cross section or impact parameters smaller than about 3 fm .",
    "since the data still have a 15% systematic errors besides the statistical ones , we have not let the generated events going through the zero degree calorimeter to simulate the experimental trigger conditions .",
    "instead , we perform calculations with impact parameters smaller than 3 fm and compare the data with calculations using the impact parameter of 2 fm which is about the average impact parameter of the central collisions . this is probably sufficient for our current purposes .",
    "first , let us study the proton transverse momentum distribution . in fig .",
    "25 , we show the calculated spectrum by the round symbols in the left window using the cascade and the right window using the soft equation of state .",
    "the least square fit to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite are shown by the solid lines . in the cascade case",
    ", the calculation agrees with the data rather well except in the low transverse momentum region .",
    "the larger theoretical values are probably due to the fact that we count all protons in the final state although some of them are still bound in light clusters , while the data are for protons only . to estimate the number of bound protons , we apply a cut to the local baryon density such that only protons with @xmath301 are counted .",
    "the spectra calculated in this way are shown with the cross symbols which agree well with the data even at low transverse momenta .",
    "the spectra calculated with the soft equation of state show an increase of about 25% mainly at large transverse momenta compared with that from the cascade as a result of the repulsive mean field at high densities .",
    "this difference , however , is comparable to the combined statistical and systematical errors of the data .",
    "nevertheless , it is promising that the proton spectra at high transverse momenta may be useful for studying the equation of state at the level of sensitivity of about 25% .",
    "as we will show later , a much clearer sensitivity at the level of 250% can be obtained from an event by event analysis of the baryon transverse collective flow .    in fig .",
    "26 , we show the calculated proton rapidity distributions .",
    "as one would expect , the mean field leads to less stopping .",
    "this observation is consistent with our early discussions about the mean field effects on the creation of superdense hadronic matter .",
    "it is seen that without applying the local density cut at @xmath302 , the mean field reduces the height but increases the width of dn / dy at midrapidity by about 15% . with the local density cut",
    ", the calculation with the mean field can better reproduce the data , but again the difference between the two calculations is comparable to current systematic errors in the data . as we have stated earlier ,",
    "the above calculations are carried out at a fixed impact parameter of 2 fm . to quantify the impact parameter dependence of the stopping power in central collisions , we show in fig .",
    "27 the proton rapidity distributions at impact parameters of 1 fm and 3 fm . in both calculations with and without the mean field , the height of the rapidity distribution at the midrapidity increases by about 25% as the impact parameter changes from 3 fm to 1 fm . with an impact parameter of 3 fm , a clear bump due to spectators at the projectile and target rapidities can be seen .",
    "the variation of the rapidity distribution at these two impact parameters caused by the mean field is again at the level of 15% .",
    "pions are copiously produced in heavy - ion collisions at ags energies and are expected to play an important role in the stopping and thermal equilibration of the system .",
    "the study of pion rapidity and transverse momentum spectra provides thus useful information about the collision dynamics , the properties of the superdense hadronic matter , and the particle production mechanisms . in fig .",
    "28 and fig .  29 , we compare calculated @xmath303 and @xmath192 transverse momentum spectra using the cascade and soft equation of state with each other and also with the least square fit to the data ( solid lines ) . the rapidity range for each spectrum",
    "is indicated in the figure .",
    "it is seen that both calculations can reproduce the data reasonably well except at rapidities far from the center of mass rapidity , which is about 1.72 for the au+au reaction at @xmath2=11.6 gev / c .",
    "again , the variation between calculations using the cascade and the soft equation of state is on the order of 20% which is comparable to current experimental errors .",
    "the statistics in the calculations can be significantly improved by mixing events from different impact parameters .",
    "but main features of the spectra are expected to remain unchanged .",
    "we will leave a more detailed study on pion spectra , including the contribution of resonance decays at freeze - out and the coulomb effects on the difference between @xmath303 and @xmath192 spectra to a separate paper .    in fig .",
    "30 , we compare the rapidity distributions of @xmath303 calculated at an impact parameter of 2 fm using the cascade and the soft equation of state with the experimental data . the calculation with the soft equation of state seems to be closer to the data , but there exists some discrepancies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the experimental rapidity distribution was obtained by first fitting the transverse momentum spectra with an exponential function or a sum of two exponential functions and then extrapolating and integrating over the whole rapidity range . while in our calculations we simply count pions in each rapidity bin without any possible bias from the extrapolation process .",
    "it is seen that the difference between calculations with and without the mean field is again on the order of 20% , which is rather similar to the situation at the bevalac or sis / gsi energies@xcite .",
    "the impact parameter dependence of the pion rapidity distribution is shown in fig .",
    "the dependence here is rather weak compared to that of the proton rapidity distribution .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that there is an almost complete overlapping between the target and the project in collisions with impact parameters smaller than 3 fm and the large number of pions produced in these collisions .",
    "mechanisms for kaon production at ags energies have been a subject of intensive studies in the past few years . in particular ,",
    "the enhancement of @xmath304 ratio in heavy - ion collisions with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath305 reactions has been attracting much attention due to the possible role of strangeness as a signature of the quark - gluon plasma@xcite .",
    "however , no definite conclusion has been reached due to the complexity of the collision dynamics at ags energies and our incomplete knowledge about the properties of hadrons and their interactions in hot dense matter .    in fig .",
    "32 , we show the contributions to @xmath156 production from various collision channels as a function of the center - of - mass energy of the colliding pairs in au+au collisions at @xmath306 gev / c .",
    "it is seen that large contributions come from meson+baryon and meson+meson collisions , besides that from baryon+baryon collisions .",
    "this is in agreement with the predictions from ref .",
    "@xcite based on the hydrochemical model calculations .",
    "more quantitatively , about 35% , 40% and 25% of the produced kaons come from baryon+baryon , meson+baryon and meson+meson collisions , respectively .",
    "the relative importance of different @xmath156 sources seen here does not agree completely with results from either the rqmd or the arc .",
    "since there are many assumptions in each model , it is not apparent to us at this time what is the cause for the difference among these models .",
    "it is certainly of great interest to resolve this difference in future studies .",
    "however , this can only be possible when all assumptions used in all models are made clear .    for ease of future comparisons with other models and also for studying the kaon production dynamics ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "33 the @xmath156 production rate as a function of time for various channels .",
    "the calculation is carried out for head - on collisions at @xmath287 gev / c using the cascade .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath307 fm / c the production rates due to nucleon+nucleon , meson+baryon ( including resonances ) and nucleon+baryon resonance are almost the same . soon after that the @xmath156 production rate is dominated by meson+baryon collisions which also last a longer time .",
    "the @xmath156 production rates due to nucleon+baryon resonance , nucleon+nucleon and baryon resonance+baryon resonance decrease to zero after about 6 fm / c .",
    "meson+meson collisions come in later , but they contribute significantly to the @xmath156 production especially during the expansion phase of the collision",
    ". the time dependence of @xmath156 production studied here may be useful for further studies on the production mechanisms for kaons .",
    "moreover , kaons produced at different times through different channels may also contribute to different parts of the kaon spectra .",
    "we , however , leave the more detailed discussions on this subject to future studies .",
    "we now go back to the question of comparing kaon spectra calculated with and without the mean field with the preliminary data from the e802/e866 collaboration .",
    "34 shows the comparison on the kaon transverse momentum distributions .",
    "the solid lines in both windows are the exponential fit to the data to guide the eye .",
    "it is seen that both calculations agree with the data reasonably well . however , there are some discrepancies between calculations and experimental data especially at high transverse momenta . within error bars of the calculations",
    "the two calculated spectra are almost indistinguishable .",
    "35 shows the @xmath156 rapidity distributions .",
    "the data at rapidities larger than 1.72 are the reflections of those at rapidities less than 1.72 . except at rapidities near the center - of - mass rapidity",
    "the two calculations are very close to each other . even at the midrapidity",
    "the sensitivity to the equation of state is only about 15% .",
    "this situation is rather different from that at sis / gsi energies where subthreshold kaon production is very sensitive to the nuclear equation of state@xcite .",
    "since kaon production at ags energies is high above the threshold , the sensitivity of kaons to the equation of state is not expected to be very different from that of nucleons and pions . to be complete ,",
    "we show the impact parameter dependence of kaon production in fig .",
    "the sensitivity of kaon multiplicity to the impact parameter is at the level of 20% in central collisions , which is rather similar to that of pions .",
    "the same level of sensitivity to both the impact parameter and the equation of state in central collisions makes it even harder to learn about the equation of state from these observables .",
    "in contrast to the inclusive observables discussed above , collective observables are very sensitive to the equation of state as we shall show in the next section .",
    "hinted by the findings at bevelac energies that the collective variables or correlation functions , unlike single particle observables , are very sensitive to the nuclear equation of state , we now turn to the analysis of the baryon transverse collective flow@xcite .",
    "here we use the standard flow analysis in transport models as in ref .",
    "it has been shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that an improved flow analysis with the explicit conservation of reaction plane and angular momentum in an individual hadron - hadron collision results in an increase of the transverse momentum by about 8% to 23% at bevalac energies .",
    "this small enhancement is not expected to affect our discussions and conclusions .",
    "first , we show in fig .",
    "37 the average transverse momentum of nucleons in the reaction plane as a function of rapidity for the collision of au+au at @xmath30811.6 gev / c and at impact parameters of 2 , 6 and 10 fm .",
    "it is seen that the collective flow is the strongest in midcentral collisions in both calculations .",
    "most importantly , significant differences exist between calculations with and without the mean field for collisions at all three impact parameters .",
    "in particular , the flow parameter defined as @xmath309 is about a factor of 2.5 larger in the case with the mean field .",
    "the strength of the so - called `` bounce - off '' effect at target or projectile rapidities is also much stronger in calculations with the mean field . to measure the strength of the `` bounce - off '' effect",
    ", we define the average total in - plane transverse momentum as @xmath310    to see how the collective flow is a sensitive probe of the reaction dynamics in the high density region , we show in fig .",
    "38 and fig .",
    "39 the flow parameter @xmath311 and the total in - plane transverse momentum @xmath312 as functions of time for au+au reactions at impact parameters of 2 fm and 6 fm , respectively . for comparisons ,",
    "the central densities are also shown in the lower windows of fig .",
    "38 and fig .  39 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the flow is mainly generated in the high density region and does not change in the expansion phase .",
    "the increase of the total in - plane transverse momentum during the expansion phase is much more substantial in the case with the mean field than in the cascade case .",
    "this indicates that the mean field effect is large in the expansion phase as we have expected .",
    "the total in - plane transverse momentum reaches its final value after about 15 fm / c . the ratio of final flow parameters in the calculations with and without the mean field is about 2.5 at both impact parameters .",
    "this difference is large enough for distinguishing the predictions from different models . for collision at an impact parameter of 6 fm , the flow parameter decreases slightly before reaching its final value .",
    "this is mainly due to the reflection of hot baryons from the cold spectator nucleons in collisions at large impact parameters .",
    "it is interesting to note that a clear signature of transverse collective flow has been discovered recently in au+au reactions at @xmath2= 11.4 gev / c by the e877 collaboration@xcite . in this experiment",
    "the distribution of the normalized transverse energy dipole moments is found to shift systematically toward finite values for more central collisions .",
    "we are planning to make a detailed comparison with these data in the near future .",
    "furthermore , the preliminary data of the e877 collaboration indicates a smaller transverse momentum in the reaction plane than the predictions from both present and other models @xcite , which may indeed indicate that the equation of state is significantly softened due to the formation of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "in summary , we have developed a new relativistic transport model ( art 1.0 ) for heavy - ion collisions at the ags energies .",
    "this model is an extension of the very successful buu model for intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions by including more baryon and meson resonances as well as interactions among them . comparing to the well - known arc model @xcite",
    ", the present model has more resonances which are found to be important for the collision dynamics and particle production at ags energies .",
    "moreover , we have used consistently finite mass distributions for these resonances which have significant effects on particle spectra .",
    "in addition , a selfconsistent mean field for baryons is included .",
    "however , comparing to another well - known rqmd model @xcite , where all resonances up to mass of 2.0 gev are explicitly included , we do not have as many baryon resonances .",
    "nevertheless , we have partially included the effects of these resonances by using meson+baryon cross sections calculated from the implicit formation of higher resonances .",
    "as we are mainly interested in developing a reliable model for energies up to about 15 gev / nucleon , we do not invoke the string / rope mechanisms for particle production as in rqmd .    due to the lack of some hadron - hadron collision data , the input to the model still has some uncertainties .",
    "several assumptions used in the model may need to be improved in future versions of the model .",
    "in particular , interactions among resonances are largely unknown and have been assumed to be the same as nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "additional hadrons , such as @xmath313 , etc , are to be included in the model . at ags energies",
    "the resonance population is as large as that of nucleons in the compression phase , the assumption of the same mean field for nucleons and resonances may need to be improved .",
    "currently , the finite formation time for produced particles has only been partially taken into account through the finite lifetime of the resonances .",
    "a more consistent method may be necessary . also , it is of interest to include the mean field potential for pions@xcite and kaons@xcite as well as the bose enhancement factor for pions@xcite .",
    "the most inconsistent , but also probably the most interesting feature shared by this model and others is the prediction that the conditions for forming the quark - gluon plasma have already been reached in heavy - ion collisions at ags energies . in particular , at the maximum baryon density of about @xmath271 and meson density of @xmath277 hadrons are squeezed on top of each other and probably melt into the quark - gluon plasma . at this high density hadronic models naturally breaks down .",
    "it remains a great challenge to actually include the quark and gluon degrees of freedom into the model and to study the phase transition .    with the above reservations about the validity of the model",
    ", we have studied several aspects and issues of heavy - ion reactions at ags energies .",
    "in particular , we have explored effects of the nuclear mean field on the collision dynamics , the formation of superdense hadronic matter , single particle observables as well as the radial and transverse collective flow .",
    "it is found that the mean field significantly reduces the maximum energy and baryon densities of the superdense hadronic matter formed in the collision .",
    "inclusive single particle observables are sensitive to the equation of state only at the level of 20% . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse collective flow of baryons are found to be very sensitive to the equation of state .",
    "in particular , including a soft nuclear equation of state increases the flow parameter by a factor of 2.5 which is large enough to distinguish the predictions from different theoretical models . moreover , this sensitivity also indicates that the collective flow can be a useful probe of the formation of the quark - gluon plasma at ags energies .",
    "preliminary data have shown a smaller baryon transverse flow in the reaction plane than model predictions , and this may indeed indicate the significant softening of the equation of state due to the formation of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "it is very encouraging that the present model has been very useful for studying the interesting physics in high energy heavy - ion collisions .",

    "<S> we present the detail of a newly developed relativistic transport model ( art 1.0 ) for high energy heavy - ion collisions . using this model , we first study the general collision dynamics between heavy ions at the ags energies . </S>",

    "<S> we also investigate the degree and time scale of thermalization as well as the radial flow during the expansion of the superdense hadronic matter . </S>",
    "<S> the flow velocity profile and the temperature of the hadronic matter at freeze - out are extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of protons , pions and kaons calculated with and without the mean field are compared with each other and also with the preliminary data from the e866/e802 collaboration to search for experimental observables that are sensitive to the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that these inclusive , single particle observables depend weakly on the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between results obtained with and without the nuclear mean field is only about 20% . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon transverse collective flow in the reaction plane is also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that both the flow parameter and the strength of the `` bounce - off '' effect are very sensitive to the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a soft equation of state with a compressibility of 200 mev results in an increase of the flow parameter by a factor of 2.5 compared to the cascade case without the mean field . </S>",
    "<S> this large effect makes it possible to distinguish the predictions from different theoretical models and to detect the signatures of the quark - gluon plasma which is expected to significantly soften the equation of state . + * pacs number(s ) : 25.75.+r * </S>"
