    "random planar graphs  random graphs that can be drawn on the 2d plane with no edge crossing @xcite  pervade many different fields from abstract mathematics @xcite , to theoretical physics @xcite , botanics @xcite , geography and urban studies @xcite . in particular , planar graphs are central in biology where they can be used to describe veination patterns of leaves or insect wings and which display an interesting architecture with many loops at different scales @xcite . in the study of urban systems ,",
    "planar networks are extensively used to represent , to a good approximation , various infrastructure networks @xcite such as transportation networks @xcite and streets patterns @xcite .",
    "understanding the structure and the evolution of these networks is therefore interesting from a purely graph theoretical point of view , but could also have an impact in different fields where these structures are central .",
    "most previous studies characterize different aspects of these graphs , either purely topological ( degree distribution , clustering , etc . ) or geometrical ( angles , segment length , face area distribution , etc . ) . due to spatial constraints , most local information such as the degree distribution ,",
    "the clustering or the assortativity have however a trivial behavior @xcite .",
    "in addition the important information about these random planar graphs is in fact not in their adjacency matrix only but also in their geometry described by the spatial distribution of nodes and relevant meaures should combine topology and geometry . despite the large number of studies on these graphs ,",
    "there is still a lack of a non - local high - level metrics that allow for understanding and comparing these graphs with each other .",
    "however , a promising direction is given by path - based quantities such as the simplicity @xcite or as we will discuss here , the betweenness centrality ( bc ) @xcite .",
    "the bc was introduced to quantify the importance of a node ( or a link ) in a network , but proved to be a very interesting tool in the study of random planar graphs . already in @xcite",
    ", we can observe interesting spatial patterns displayed by links with a large bc .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the most salient aspects of the structural changes during the evolution of the street network of paris @xcite is revealed by the spatial distribution of the nodes with the largest bc .",
    "these different results therefore point to the fact that high centrality nodes form non - trivial patterns , and among them , the emergence of loops .",
    "all these different results point to the fact the bc , which is relatively simple , is a good candidate for monitoring and understanding the organization of random planar graphs . in this study",
    "we will focus on the apearance of loops made of links with large bc and we will propose a simple toy model that allows us to discuss the conditions for the appearance of such patterns .    the emergence of rings in largely urbanized areas is a common fact and the study presented here gives a topological light on this phenomenon .",
    "our study echoes previous work where congestion effect at a central hub could be so high that avoiding the ring is beneficial @xcite . here",
    ", in contrast , we do not take into account congestion and discuss the conditions necessary for a loop to become more interesting in terms of time cost .",
    "basic results on planar networks can be found in any graph theory textbook ( see for example @xcite and for useful algorithms see @xcite ) and we will very briefly recall the definition of these objects . basically , a planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in the plane in such a way that its edges do not intersect .",
    "not all drawings of planar graphs are without intersection and a drawing without intersection is sometimes called a plane graph or a planar embedding of the graph . in real - world cases , these considerations actually do not apply since the nodes and the edges represent in general physical objects .",
    "more precisely , we will focus here on the case of planar graphs embedded in 2d space , which typically describes systems such as the road and street network .",
    "the betweenness centrality counts the fraction of shortest paths going through a given node ( or link ) and is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a node , @xmath10 is the number of shortest paths from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and @xmath13 those paths going through @xmath9 . in general",
    "the summation is on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and this is the convention that we will adopt in this paper .",
    "the constant @xmath17 is the normalisation and we will use here @xmath18 which counts the number of pairs and ensures that @xmath19 $ ] . for edges ,",
    "the definition of the bc is similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : bc ] .",
    "it is important to stress here that the bc could in fact be defined for any type of paths .",
    "the most common choice is the shortest path but we will use the more general case of weighted shortest path , which corresponds to the quickest path if the weight of a link represents time . for numerical calculations , we implemented the now standard algorithm of brandes @xcite .      in a one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath1 ,",
    "the bc of a site @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 and the maximum thus corresponds to the barycenter of all nodes ( see fig.[fig : nat_vs_lat ] ) ( in the two - dimensional case we obtain a similar behavior ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    when we introduce disorder - by removing or rewiring links - the bc becomes important at nodes that can be far away from the barycenter ( see fig.[fig : nat_vs_lat ] ) . in the extreme case where space does nt play a role anymore such as in scale - free networks , the average bc per degree classes @xmath22 scales as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an exponent that depends on the structure of the graph . even if there are fluctuations around this scaling it shows here that essentially the degree controls the bc in these graphs .",
    "a simple way to construct a random planar graph is to consider a regular lattice where each link has a probabilty @xmath25 to be present ( and @xmath26 to be removed ) . above the percolation threshold @xmath27",
    ", the system displays a giant component which connects a non - zero fraction of the nodes",
    ". we can study the bc on this giant component and filter them for different threshold @xmath28 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : perco ] the set of links that belong to the giant component and with bc larger than @xmath28 for different values of this threshold     and with normalized bc larger than @xmath28 . from left to right , the threshold @xmath28 increases and the largest loop is here highlighted with a thick line.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and with normalized bc larger than @xmath28 . from left to right , the threshold @xmath28 increases and the largest loop is here highlighted with a thick line.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and with normalized bc larger than @xmath28 . from left to right , the threshold @xmath28 increases and the largest loop is here highlighted with a thick line.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and with normalized bc larger than @xmath28 . from left to right , the threshold @xmath28 increases and the largest loop is here highlighted with a thick line.,title=\"fig : \" ]    and we observe that the set of most central links forms a non - trivial pattern , and in general displays many loops ( we show the largest one in fig .

    "streets and roads form a network where nodes are intersections and links are segment roads , and which is planar ( or almost planar , to a good approximation ) .",
    "this network is now fairly well characterized and due to spatial constraints , the degree distribution is peaked , the clustering coefficient and assortativity are large , and most of the interesting information lies in the spatial distribution of betweeenness centrality @xcite .",
    "many studies @xcite considered different aspects of this network and observed non - trivial structures in the bc spatial distribution . in particular , in @xcite it has been observed that the distribution of the bc can display non - trivial spatial patterns and in @xcite the authors showed that during the evolution of the street network of paris ( france ) most ` standard ' measures were unable to detect the important structural changes that occurred in the @xmath29 century , while in contrast , the spatial distribution of the bc displayed dramatic changes .    using the road network obtained from city extracts ( the data has been obtained from the mapzen website @xcite ) ,",
    "we compute the bc distribution for different cities shown in fig . [ fig : realworld ] .     with a bc larger than a certain threshold @xmath30 and we highlight the largest loop .",

    "[ fig : realworld],title=\"fig : \" ]    for all these real - world cases , we observe that indeed non - trivial structures appear and in particular we observe the appearance of loops made of central links and of different sizes .",

    "fig : perimeter],title=\"fig : \" ]    we observe on this plot the presence of various plateaus at intermediate values of @xmath28 suggesting that these loops are indeed very central and stable .    in general",
    ", boundary effects can be important and can affect the measures done on spatial networks @xcite . in general , the choice of boundaries has an impact on quantities such as the bc @xcite and we briefly discuss this problem here .",
    "we repeat the same measure of the perimeter of the largest loop on the same network but at different scales ( ie . with different boundaries ) and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : perimeter](right ) . in this figure",
    ", we observe that at least the perimeter of the largest loop remains relatively stable .",
    "further systematic studies are however certainly needed in order to understand which patterns are stable and which ones are not , and what are the conditions on the boundaries in order to ensure stability of the main spatial patterns .",
    "these different examples discussed above show that the introduction of disorder in planar graphs induce in general the formation of non - trivial structures made of links with a large bc . in particular , we observe the appearance of loops made of links that can have a bc larger than the barycenter . in other words , disorder can invert the typical behavior observed for regular lattice where the bc is decreasing monotonously from the barycenter .",
    "in the following , we propose a toy model which allows to discuss and to understand under which conditions a loop can become more central than the spatial center .",
    "as discussed above , we observe that non - trivial objects such as loops can be very central in random graphs .",
    "it is important to understand the formation of these structures and the conditions for their existence . in particular",
    ", it seems that randomness can induce very large perturbation in the spatial distribution of the bc and we can be a situation where the barycenter is not the most central node , or equivalently , that the bc is not a simple decreasing function of the distance to the barycenter anymore . in order to understand this phenomenon ,",
    "we propose here a simple toy model .",
    "we first construct a star network composed of @xmath0 branches , where each branch is composed of @xmath1 nodes .",
    "we then add a loop at distance @xmath3 from the center ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : toymodel ] for a sketch of this graph ) .",
    "we also consider here a more general case where the links are weighted and in this simplified model we assume that links have a weight equal to one and the loop segment between two consecutive branches has a weight given by @xmath4 .",
    "the purely topological case then corresponds to the case @xmath31 .",
    "we then compute the bc using weighted shortest paths .",
    "this generalization allows us to discuss for example the impact of different velocities on a street network . in this case , @xmath4 can be seen as the time spent on the segment and the weighted shortest path is then the quickest path .    , the number of nodes on each branch is @xmath32 and the loop is located at a distance @xmath33 from the center @xmath34 .",
    "the node @xmath35 is at the intersection of a branch and the loop and @xmath36 is the terminal node of a branch.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    here , we want to discuss under which conditions the loop will be more central than the ` origin ' at the center in this simplified network . intuitively , for very large @xmath4 , it is always less costly to avoid the loop , while for @xmath37 , loops are very advantageous .",
    "the two main quantities of interest are therefore the centrality at the center denoted by @xmath38 and the centrality , denoted by @xmath39 , at the intersection @xmath35 of the branch and the loop .",
    "we then compute the difference @xmath40 and will study under which condition it can be negative .",
    "the interest of this toy model lies in the fact that we can estimate analytically the bc for the center @xmath41 and for the intersection nodes on the loop @xmath42 .",
    "formally we can write these quantities as @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are positive .",
    "we distinguish two parts in these centralities .",
    "first , we estimate the bc when there is no loop which is represented by the case where @xmath45 .",
    "this part is modified by the presence of the loop that under certain conditions can be more interesting for connecting pairs of nodes .",
    "we can understand the signs in eq .",
    "[ eq : exact ] , by noting that the presence of the loop will decrease the centrality at the center and increase the centrality at @xmath35 .",
    "the different terms @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) count the paths ( that avoid @xmath34 ) connecting two nodes that lie on different parts of their branch : when both nodes are on the upper part of the branches we obtain @xmath49 ; the paths connecting an upper part to a lower part are described by @xmath50 and when both nodes lie on a lower part , we obtain the coefficient @xmath51 . for more details and the calculation of these coefficients , we refer to the appendix .",
    "the exact expressions for the centralities @xmath52 and @xmath53 are however difficult to handle analytically , essentially because they are expressed as sums of complicated arguments ( see appendix ) . in order to derive analytical predictions",
    "we will propose in the following a simple approximation scheme that allows to obtain the correct scalings for the most important quantities .    in the derivation of the exact expression of the centralities eq .",

    "this essentially amounts to compare the cost of the path between a node on the lower part ( with @xmath58 ) of the first branch @xmath59 to a node on the lower part ( @xmath60 ) of another branch @xmath61 . if @xmath62>j-1 $ ] the cost of the path which goes through @xmath34 is larger than going directly via the loop ( given by @xmath63 ) and therefore produces a negative contribution to @xmath52 .",
    "we see that this discussion allows to distinguish for a given value of @xmath4 ` near ' from ` far - away ' branches ( fig .",
    "[ fig : approx_g0 ] ) . the nearest branches",
    "are then defined by the condition @xmath64 and the remote branches by @xmath65 ( for simplicity we assume here that @xmath0 is odd and by symmetry we can discuss only one half for the branches from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) .     at the center @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : approx_g0 ] ]    we will then the use the following simplification : for the @xmath68 near branches , going through the center is always the best choice for @xmath69 and @xmath70 only and gives @xmath71 for the @xmath72 far - away branches , we consider that for all nodes @xmath73 , the paths are going through the center leading to @xmath74 taking into account the factor @xmath75 for not counting twice the same path , we obtain for @xmath76 the following expression @xmath77 we note that this approximation recovers both exact limits @xmath78 in the following it will also be useful to consider the limit @xmath79 with @xmath80 fixed which gives for @xmath81 ( up to terms of order @xmath82 ) @xmath83 where the only dependence on @xmath4 is now encoded in @xmath68 , hence the change of argument for clarity .",
    "we can produce the same type of arguments for the bc on the loop .",
    "first the value without the loop is easy to compute and we obtain @xmath84\\ ] ] which simply counts the number @xmath85 of nodes ` above ' @xmath35 and all the others ( @xmath35 being excluded ) .",
    "similar arguments as above then give the following result ( we also changed here the argument of the function from @xmath4 to @xmath68 ) @xmath86\\\\ \\nonumber & + \\frac{\\chi(\\chi-1)}{2}\\big[(n-\\ell+1)^2\\\\ & + 2(n-\\ell+1)(\\ell-1)+\\frac{(\\ell-1)(\\ell-2)}{2}\\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : chi ] .",
    "in particular the term proportional to @xmath68 counts all the paths between the lower part of the branch containing @xmath35 and all the nodes of a branch close enough .",
    "the second term ( proportional to @xmath87 ) counts the paths going from a branch @xmath61 with @xmath88 $ ] to the other branches @xmath89 .",
    "the sum of all these contributions gives the factor @xmath90 .",
    "the counting factor is not trivial here and comes from evaluating all the paths from a node @xmath11 in a branch @xmath57 to a node @xmath12 on a branch @xmath91 ( @xmath57 and @xmath91 are different from @xmath2 ) such that @xmath92 the left hand side of this inequality corresponds to the distance through the center and @xmath93 is the distance on the loop ( for the exact expression of the centrality and how to recover this approximate formula , we refer the interested reader to the appendix ) .",
    "similarly to the case of the bc at @xmath34 , it will be convenient for analyzing these expressions to consider the limit @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",
    "up to terms of order @xmath82 we then obtain for @xmath96 @xmath97    we show in the figure [ fig : approx ] the comparison of the exact result with the approximations developed here .     ( top ) and @xmath98 ( middle ) ( the bc are here normalized ) .",
