    "far from the stability line will become possible with newly proposed experimental facilities .",
    "one of the projects at the future fair facility of the gsi laboratory / germany is the study of electron scattering off unstable nuclei in an electron - ion collider mode @xcite . a similar proposal exists for the riken  laboratory facility in japan @xcite . by means of elastic electron scattering",
    ", these facilities will become the main probe of charge distribution in unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "coulomb excitation has been very useful in determining the electromagnetic response in light nuclei @xcite . for neutron - rich isotopes",
    "@xcite the resulting photo - neutron cross sections are characterized by a pronounced concentration of low - lying @xmath0 strength .",
    "but it is well known that non - perturbative effects leading to distortion of the energy spectrum of the fragments interacting with the target ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is a problem of difficult nature .",
    "the nuclear response probed with electrons is free from such effects .",
    "the interpretation of the low - lying @xmath0 strength in neutron - rich nuclei engendered a debate : are these soft dipole modesjust a manifestation of the loosely - bound character of light neutron - rich nuclei , or are they the result of the excitation of a resonance ? @xcite . the electromagnetic response in light nuclei , leading to their dissociation , is related to the nuclear physics needed in several astrophysical sites @xcite .",
    "the existence of pygmy resonances have important implications on theoretical predictions of radiative neutron capture rates in the r - process nucleosynthesis , and consequently on the calculated elemental abundance distribution in the universe @xcite .",

    "the geometric coefficient @xmath18 and the transition density @xmath19 will depend upon the nuclear model adopted .",
    "one can also define a differential cross section integrated over angles so that @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the maximum electron scattering angle , which depends upon the experimental setup .",
    "notice that the lowest limit in the above integral is @xmath22 , and not zero .",
    "[ epa]-[epa3 ] show that under the conditions of the proposed electron - ion colliders , electron scattering will offer the same information obtained with real photons .",
    "the reaction dynamics information is in the virtual photon spectrum , @xmath23 , while the nuclear response dynamics information is in eq .",
    "[ photo ] .",
    "@xmath24 is interpreted as the number of equivalent ( real ) photons incident on the nucleus per unit scattering angle @xmath25 and per unit photon energy @xmath26 for larger scattering angles the coulomb multipole matrix elements are in general larger than the electric ( @xmath12 ) multipoles , and monopole transitions become relevant @xcite .",
    ". [ epa ] will not be valid under these conditions .",
    "it is found that the spectrum @xmath27 increases rapidly with decreasing energies @xcite . for @xmath28 mev and excitation energies @xmath29 mev",
    ", the spectrum yields the ratios @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "however , although @xmath32 increases with the multipolarity @xmath33 , the nuclear response decreases rapidly with @xmath33 , and @xmath0 excitations tend to dominate the cross sections . for larger electron energies the ratios @xmath34 and @xmath35 decrease rapidly .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath0 virtual photon spectrum , @xmath36 , of 1 gev electrons with the spectrum generated by 1 gev / nucleon heavy ion projectiles was published in ref .",
    "the virtual spectrum for the electron contains more hard photons , i.e. the spectrum decreases slower with photon energy than the heavy ion photon spectrum .",
    "this is because , in both situations , the rate at which the spectrum decreases depends on the ratio of the projectile kinetic energy to its rest mass , @xmath37 which is much larger for the electron ( @xmath38 ) than for the heavy ion ( @xmath39 nuclear mass ) .",
    "in a two - body model , the single - particle picture has been used previously to study coulomb excitation of halo nuclei with success @xcite .",

    "the peak occurs at @xmath45 .",
    "the second term inside brackets in eq . [ isp ] is a modification due to final state interactions .",
    "it is important in many cases @xcite .",
    "many weakly - bound nuclei , like @xmath46he or @xmath47li , require a three  body treatment .",
    "in one particular model , the bound  state wavefunction in the center of mass system is written as an expansion over hyperspherical harmonics , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "for weakly - bound systems having no bound subsystems the hyperradial functions behave asymptotically as @xcite @xmath48 as @xmath49 , where the two - nucleon separation energy is related to @xmath50 by @xmath51 .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 transition matrix element is obtained by a sandwich of the e1 operator between @xmath52 and scattering wavefunctions .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , but using distorted scattering states , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the core - neutron asymptotic continuum wavefunction , assumed to be a @xmath55-wave , and @xmath56 is the neutron - neutron asymptotic continuum wavefunction , assumed to be an @xmath57-wave .",
    "the @xmath0 strength function is proportional to the square of eq .",
    "[ ie1 ] integrated over all momentum variables . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 three - body response function of @xmath47li can still be described by an expression similar to the two - body case , but with different factors .",
    "explicitly , @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 , one has to use an effective @xmath60 , with @xmath61 . with this approximation ,",
    "the peak of the strength function in the three - body case is situated at about three times higher energy than for the two - body case . in the three - body model ,",
    "the maximum is thus predicted at @xmath62 , which fits the experimental peak position for the @xmath47li @xmath0 strength function very well @xcite .",
    "it is thus apparent that the effect of three - body configurations is to widen and to shift the strength function @xmath63 to higher energies .      as with giant dipole resonances ( gdr ) in stable nuclei",
    ", one believes that pygmy resonances at energies close to threshold are present in halo , or neutron - rich , nuclei .",
    "this was proposed by suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite using the hydrodynamical model for collective vibrations .",
    "we will use the method of myers et al .",
    "@xcite , considering collective vibrations in nuclei as an admixture of goldhaber - teller ( gt ) and steinwedel - jensen ( sj ) modes . for light nuclei goldhaber - teller modes dominate .    for spherically symmetric densities , the transition density , @xmath64 ,",
    "can be calculated assuming a combination of sj and gt distributions @xcite",
    ", @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mean nuclear radius , and @xmath67 is the percent displacement of the center of mass of neutron and proton fluids in the gt ( @xmath68 ) and sj ( @xmath69 ) modes . for light , weakly - bound nuclei , it is appropriate to assume that the neutrons inside the core ( @xmath70 ) vibrate in phase with the protons .",
    "the neutrons and protons in the core are tightly bound . calling the excess nucleons by @xmath71 the effective charge for the gt mode",
    "is @xmath72 @xmath73 . in eq .",
    "[ transdsjgt ] , @xmath74 is the spherical bessel function of first order , @xmath75 the percent displacement of the center of mass of the neutron and proton fluids in the sj mode , @xmath76    the hydrodynamical model can be further explored to obtain the energy and excitation strength of the collective excitations .",
    "this can be achieved by finding the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath77 where @xmath78 is now a vector containing gt and sj contributions to the collective motion . @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the kinetic and potential energies @xmath81 matrices @xcite .",
    "the kinetic term can be calculated from gt and sj velocity fields .",
    "the potential term is related to the stiffness parameters of the liquid - drop model and adjusted to a best fit to the nuclear masses .",
    "the stiffness of the system is due to the change in symmetry energy of the system as it goes out of the equilibrium position .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian is the rayleigh dissipation term , which is related to the fermi velocity of the nucleons @xcite and yields the width of the eigenstate .    as shown by myers et al .",
    "@xcite , the liquid drop model predicts an equal admixture of sj+gt oscillation modes for large nuclei .",
    "the contribution of the sj oscillation mode decreases with decreasing mass number , i.e. @xmath82 as @xmath83 .",
    "this is even more probable in the case of halo nuclei , where a special type of gt mode ( oscillations of the core against the halo nucleons ) is likely to be dominant .",
    "for this special collective motion an approach different than those used in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite has to be considered .",
    "it is easy to make changes in the original goldhaber and teller  @xcite formula to obtain the energy of the collective vibrations , yielding @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the length within which the interaction between a neutron and a nucleus changes from a zero - value outside the nucleus to a high value inside , i.e. @xmath86 is the width of the nuclear surface .",
    "@xmath87 is the energy needed to extract one neutron from the proton environment .",
    "goldhaber and teller @xcite argued that in a heavy stable nucleus @xmath87 is not the binding energy of the nucleus , but the part of the potential energy due neutron - proton asymmetry . in the case of weakly - bound nuclei this picture changes and it is more reasonable to associate @xmath87 to the separation energy of the valence neutrons , @xmath88 .",
    "i will use @xmath89 , with a parameter @xmath90 which is expected to be of order of one .",
    "since for halo nuclei the product @xmath91  is proportional to @xmath92 we obtain the proportionality @xmath93 . using eq .",
    "[ epgdr ] for @xmath47li , with  @xmath94 fm , @xmath95 fm and @xmath96 mev , we get @xmath97 mev . considering that the pygmy resonance will most probably decay by particle emission",
    ", one gets @xmath98 mev for the kinetic energy of the fragments .",
    "this is about a factor 2 larger than what is obtained in a numerical calculation @xcite .",
    "but it is within the right ballpark .",
    "the hydrodynamical model is very unlikely to be an accurate model for light , loosely - bound , nuclei and is significant only in that a reasonable magnitude of the resonance energy is found .    both the direct dissociation model and the hydrodynamical model yield a bump in the response function with position proportional to @xmath88 , the valence nucleon(s ) separation energy . in the direct dissociation model",
    "the width of the response function depends on the separation energy and on the nature of the model , i.e. a two- or a three - body model . in the case of the pygmy resonance ,",
    "this question is completely open .",
    "the hydrodynamical model predicts @xcite for the width of the collective mode @xmath99 , where @xmath100  is the average velocity of the nucleons inside the nucleus .",
    "this relation can be derived by assuming that the collective vibration is damped by the incoherent collisions of the nucleons with the walls of the nuclear potential well during the vibration cycles .",
    "this approach mimics that used in the kinetic theory of gases for calculating the energy transfer of a moving piston to gas molecules in a container . using @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the fermi velocity , with @xmath103 mev and @xmath104 fm",
    ", one gets @xmath105 mev .",
    "this is the typical energy width a giant dipole resonance state in a heavy nucleus .",
    "but in the case of neutron - rich light nuclei @xmath100 is not well defined .",
    "but the piston model is not able to describe the width of the response function properly .",
    "microscopic models , such as those based on random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations , are necessary to tackle this problem .",
    "the halo nucleons have to be treated in an special way to get the response at the right energy position , and with approximately the right width .",
    "right now , the problem remains if the experimentally observed peak in @xmath106 is due to a direct transition to the continuum , weighted by the phase space of the fragments , or if it proceeds sequentially via a soft dipole collective state ."
