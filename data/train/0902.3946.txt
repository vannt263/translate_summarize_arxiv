    "brownian motion is the random movement for some nanoscopic particles in a fluid . it is named in honor of robert brown who described it in 1827 .",
    "the random movement of these particles is the result of constant bombardment of his surface by fluid molecules under a thermal agitation .",
    "atomic bombardment at this scale is not always completely uniform and have large statistical variations .",
    "the pressure on one side can vary , causing the movement observed [ 4 ] .",
    "the mathematical description of the phenomenon was developed by albert einstein [ 1 ] .",
    "einstein found a way to confirm the atomic nature of matter observing the relationships between the macroscopic diffusion coefficients d and the atomic properties of matter .",
    "this relationship is :    @xmath0    since r is the gas constant , na avogadro number , t is temperature in kelvin , @xmath1 the viscosity , `` a '' the radius of the brownian particles and d is the diffusion coefficient of the material suspended in the liquid [ 1,2].the theory of brownian motion was developed in order to describe the dynamic behavior of particles whose mass and size are much larger than the rest in the medium in which they are .",
    "einstein was succeeded in proving that the average movement of the brownians particles in one direction is an expression such as :    @xmath2    in this work we present a new simple method to simulate the diffusive behavior of particles that interact in a fluid , we control the statistical characteristics of the particles movement by simples integers sums .",
    "we observed only the brownians particles in the simulation .",
    "each particle is localized in a two - dimensional network and they have for each time - step one movement direction .",
    "this direction will be chosen randomly by our algorithm .",
    "the simulation represents a percentage of total particles immersed in fluid , showing the phenomenon of self - diffusion .",
    "we perform calculations for the ( srampd ) in order to compare with the experimental values obtained for the diffusion coefficient in [ 1 ] .",
    "we calculate the standard deviation ( sd ) of the values obtained for the ( srampd ) in 50 simulations as a measure of the dispersion of the simulated data .",
    "also we make simulations changing the concentration of particles fixing the network size , and changing the size of the network for a fixed concentration . in both cases",
    "we calculate the behavior of the ( srampd ) and the ( sd ) .",
    "our model use two networks represented as two matrix ( mi and me ) .",
    "each number inside on the matrix cell s in `` mi '' represent the position in `` me '' matrix .",
    "this number may change for each time step and determine the particle position in the spatial matrix me .",
    "the supra - index of each cell in mi represents the name of each particle in me .",
    "( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this method will be called `` reticular matrix mapping '' or mmr for his spanish acronym .        in each time",
    "step each particle will move randomly in one of the possible directions .",
    "each particle will have 4 possible movement directions for the two - dimensional case and 5 if we take the possibility of non - movement . to perform this movement , for",
    "each particle in mi one may sum a integer , for each time - step .",
    "this sum may possible the particles movement to other position . to move any particle to the rigth side we need to add ( + 1 ) at the corresponding mi cell",
    ", this will move the particle to the right side in me matrix .",
    "if we sum ( -1 ) we will move the particles to the left side , ( -n3 ) for up , ( + n4 ) for down and ( + 0 ) for non - movement . n1 and n2 are the matrix components for mi and n3 , n4 the matrix components in me .    as an example : we take the particle 6 in position 13 , if we add ( + 5 ) to the particle 6 we will move the particle from position 13 to 18 in `` me '' ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "our particle systems have restrictions to moving up , down , right , left and no movement .",
    "we can assign a percentage of movement for each direction .",
    "every time - step each particle will have the chance to move in a direction that will be chosen randomly .",
    "we assign a weight of probability for each of his possible directions . in this case for our propose , all direction must have the same probability weight to correspond a random movement in all directions like in a brownian movement or a 2 dimensional random walk .",
    "( 20% up , down , right , left and non moving ) .",
    "this method allows us to stadistastically control the particles movement . in the figure 4",
    "we show snap - shots for particles which moves randomly with different weight porcentage . in this case",
    ", the particles will move preferentially to the bottom part , like high density particles in a classic fluid , subject only to gravity forces , i.e. a more higher probability to move in a `` down '' direction .",
    "the simulation showed in the figure 4 correspond with weight porcentage probabilities : down 30% , up 20% , left 20% , right 20% and non - movement of 10% in 1000 steps simulation .",
    "we can appreciate a clear trend for all particles to stay in the bottom part of the picture .",
    "a mechanism in the code prevents particles with the same number in the mi matrix , avoiding particles in the same position . for the boundary conditions",
    "are established rules on the border cells to determine the type of boundaries that we want . in our case , we choice as boundary conditions rigid - walls enclosing all particles .",
    "in order to compute ( srampd ) we take the initial and final position for all particles in the network .",
    "the number of particles is given by `` n '' sub - index .",
    "the initial position are represented by `` i '' sub - index and the final position by the `` f '' sub - index . where n = n1xn2 is the number of particles in mi . using the familiar expression for the two - dimensional distance between two points ; summing and dividing over all particles we obtain the ( srampd ) in the simulation :    @xmath3    to comparate ( srampd ) in the simulation @xmath4 , whit the experimental ( srampd )",
    "@xmath5 we need to establish a scale parameter @xmath6 associating in this , the simulation scale with the real scale .",
    "this expression will be given by the product between the ( srampd ) in the simulation @xmath4 and the scale factor @xmath6 :    @xmath7    if n is equal to @xmath8 in accordance with the kinetic theory of gases , water at @xmath9c , @xmath10 , the particles diameter 0,001 mm we have that @xmath5 in the x direction is 0.8@xmath11=@xmath12 and the displacement of a half minutes will be 0.6@xmath11 [ 1 ] .",
    "this value is independent of the number of experiments made it and its a invariable value .",
    "if we take the ( srampd ) simulation value : @xmath4=10.3159 and divide between the experimental value of @xmath13 in [ 1 ] .",
    "we can calculate the value of @xmath6 using ( 4 ) @xmath14 .",
    "obtained in 50 simulations with the same parameters mi 30x30 = 900 particles , me 100x100=10.000 cells in 200 time - steps .",
    "the probability for each movement direction was 20% for each one : up , down , right , left and not moving .",

    "the particles concentration was fixed at 20.25% .",
    "if me = 6400 = 80x80particles , and mi=36x36=1296 particles the concentration will be 20.25% .",

    "these values represent a measure of data dispersion in the simulation.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figures 6 and 7 show the behavior of @xmath4 when we vary the network size maintaining the same particles concentration 20.25% for each simulation .",
    "this concentration is a measure between the total number of cells in me and the number of particles in mi .",
    "each data obtained come from a average of 50 simulations performed with the same characteristics for @xmath4 ; 200 time - steps and the movement probability for each direction was 20% : up , down left and right and non movement .",
    "the results in figure 6 shows a similar behavior to hardy and pomeau [ 7 ] they measured the average time of free flight in a network , fixing the concentration and increasing size of the network .",
    "his results are comparable with our result however our method propose a direct way to change the movement statistical characteristic in the simulation and a new simulation technique .",
    "figure 7 shows how the scattering of data decreased as the network gets bigger , larger networks produce less dispersion in data .",
    "the dispersion value in the data are small if we compare whit the size of the network and the values of ( srampd ) .",
    "the minimum was approximately 0.02 cell units and the maximum 0.14 cells units .",

    "these values represent a measure of the dispersion data in the experiments.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    graphs 8 show the behavior of the ( srampd ) when we varying the concentration of particles in the simulations and fix the network size .",
    "we obtained data for 18 different concentrations ranged from 1% to 90% of occupancy .",
    "each point corresponded to the average value of @xmath4 in 50 simulations ; each simulation was performed in 200 time - steps with the same movement probability : up , down , left right and non movement 20% .",
    "the network size for all cases was 100x100 cells or 10.000 possible positions .",
    "we see as the value of ( srampd ) decreases when we increasing the particle concentration .",
    "that is attributed to the fact that the movement of particles depends of the numbers of available possibilities in his neighbors , if we have a more higher numbers of particles , the possibilities will be decrease changing the particles mobility .",
    "the values of ( sd ) remained in a relatively small variations if we compared with the size of the network and the simulation magnitud of ( srampd ) .",
    "the properties on invariability obtained by einstein in [ 1 ] for the compute of the ( srampd ) and the respective comparison with the diffusion coefficient in a fluid , give us a prove of the randomness characteristic of the brownian movement phenomenon .",
    "this is the same principle used in random walks in 2d .",
    "no matter how many times does the experiment we always get the same results .",
    "we represent this situation with our new method mmr and we obtained the same results for many experiment .",
    "the graphics 6 show us this result with a little dispersion proved by the smalls values of ( sd ) . for 50 experiments",
    "we obtain a dispersion of 0.0152 cells units and the mean in 50 simulations was @xmath4=10.3159cells units . in order to compare with real experiments showed in [ 1 ]",
    "we propose a scale parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we perform simulations changing the size of the network and fixing the concentration , and fixing the network size and changing the concentration . in the first case we observe an increase of @xmath4 and a soft decline in the dispersion . in the second case",
    "we observe a decline of @xmath4 caused by the increasing number of particles . for too many particles",
    "they lose possibilities to occupy positions and mobility in general decrease .",
    "the method allows us to implement a so higher complex situation , and this work represents only ones of the more simples experiment .",
    "we will go to performe simulations in : the particles movement having preferences to move in one special direction , simulations taking in a count the collisions between particles , 3d networks , fluid particles moving in a porous media , and so other situations ."
