    "<S> we present measurements of untriggered di - hadron correlations as a function of centrality in pb - pb @xmath0 tev collisions , for charged hadrons with @xmath1 gev@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements provide a map of the bulk correlation structures in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> contributions to these structures may come from jets , initial density fluctuations , elliptic flow , resonances , and/or momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> we decompose the measured correlation functions via a multi - parameter fit in order to extract the nearside gaussian , the longer range @xmath3 correlation often referred to as the soft ridge . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of including higher harmonics ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) in this procedure will be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the nearside gaussian scales with the number of binary collisions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the charge dependence of the nearside gaussian .    </S>",
    "<S> measurements of untriggered di - hadron correlations aim to explore the bulk correlation structures in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> all charged hadrons with @xmath1 gev / c are used to form a correlation function , which for this analysis is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath6 the symbol @xmath7 refers to the number of correlated and uncorrelated pairs ( or pair density ) , where the hadrons used to form the pair come from the same event . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 refers to the number of uncorrelated pairs , since the hadrons used to form the pair come from different events . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is therefore the number of correlated pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the denominator is the square root of the number of background pairs , so that represents the number of charged hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> i.e @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function therefore measures the _ number of correlated pairs per particle_. figure [ fig1 ] shows the extracted correlation function as a function of centrality . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the longer range @xmath11 correlations grows from peripheral to mid - central collisions , then falls slightly for central collisions . on the nearside , </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent structure is a short range nearside spike , which sits on top of a longer range nearside gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the short range spike was found to be from hbt and @xmath12 conversions . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow is also prominent , and is represented by the @xmath13 structure , which is independent of @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to characterise the longer range nearside gaussian via a fit decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is of particular interest , since there are various interpretations with regard to its origin @xcite , some of which give quantitative predictions at lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is sometimes referred to as the `` soft ridge '' . </S>",
    "<S> the fit decomposition is as follows : @xmath14 we extract the 2d gaussian terms ( @xmath15 under two scenarios : the first fixes @xmath16 , the second allows @xmath17 and @xmath18 to free parameters , which in turn enables higher order harmonics to be included in the prescription . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 term originates from elliptic flow , while @xmath20 term may have a variety of origins e.g. momentum conservation , directed flow , and/or awayside jets . </S>",
    "<S> bins in the region which covers a circle centered at 0,0 with a of radius 0.5 are given zero weight in the fit , to prevent the spike influencing the fit . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath21 for both scenarios varies between @xmath22 and no remaining structures were found to exist in the 2d residuals .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] shows the extracted nearside gaussian parameters . </S>",
    "<S> previous analyses at rhic energies negated the higher harmonic terms @xcite , and we find the nearside gaussian without higher harmonics behaves in a similar way : a substantial growth is seen for both the amplitude and the @xmath3 width . when higher harmonics are included , the behaviour of the gaussian is more subdued with relatively modest increases in the amplitude and @xmath3 width . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in the gaussian terms is accompanied by increases in @xmath23 which are not shown . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to convert the amplitudes @xmath24 to @xmath25 coefficients @xcite , and these were found to be consistent with another analysis at low @xmath26 @xcite , for the case where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are free parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] shows the integral of the nearside gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines assumes the number of correlated pairs in the gaussian scales with the number of binary collisions from peripheral to more central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that this hypothesis is favoured more by the gaussian extracted with higher harmonics in the fit . </S>",
    "<S> finally , figure [ fig4 ] shows the charge dependence of the nearside gaussian .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that unlike sign pairs contribute more to the near structure within alice s acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> like sign pairs have a broader structure . </S>",
    "<S> if the nearside gaussian were driven only by a flow mechanism which acts on charged hadrons independent of charge sign , one would expect no charge dependence , which is in contrast to our data .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured untriggered di - hadron correlations in pb+pb @xmath0 tev collisions . a pronounced change in the correlation structure from peripheral to central collisions is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we have quantified the nearside gaussian with two methods : including and omitting higher harmonics which has a significant effect on the extracted gaussian parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted gaussian integral with higher harmonics scales with the number of binary collisions , within the quoted uncertainties . finally , we observe a charge sign dependence for the nearside gaussian : unlike sign correlations are narrower and stronger within alice s acceptance . </S>"
