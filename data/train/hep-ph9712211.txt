    "it is well known that the optical properties of a medium may be described with the use of a permittivity tensor @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic medium referred as such a medium in which the permittivity tensor is a symmetric tensor @xcite . in the general case",
    "the components of this tensor are complex values and , because of this , the complex permittivity tensor does not reduce to principal axes , except in specific cases .",
    "the simplest example of such an anisotropic medium of the general type is a combination of the two linearly polarized monochromatic laser waves with different frequencies ( dichromatic wave ) moving in the same direction . in general the directions of linear polarization of these monochromatic waves are different .",
    "another more complicated example is a single crystal oriented in the region of coherent @xmath1-pair production @xcite .",
    "the permittivity tensor was found for both these examples in papers@xcite . besides , in @xcite the theory of @xmath0-quanta propagation in the anisotropic medium of a general type is also considered .",
    "one of the main results of these papers is the prediction of sensitivity of the anisotropic medium to the initial circular polarization of propagating @xmath0-quanta .",
    "it is important for creating of devices measuring the circular polarization of @xmath0-quanta or longitudinal polarization of electrons . in the last case",
    "the electron beam is transformed into bremsstrahlung @xmath0-beam by the use of amorphous target @xcite .",
    "the circular polarization of the end of bremsstrahlung spectrum is approximately equal to the longitudinal polarization of a primary electron beam . in this paper",
    "we consider the theoretical basis for creating of the @xmath0-beam polarimeters .",
    "as already noted , the theoretical description of @xmath0-quanta propagation in the anisotropic medium is contained in paper @xcite .",
    "the permittivity tensor in single crystals oriented in the region of coherent @xmath1-pair production is found in @xcite . in the case of high energy @xmath0-quanta",
    "the process of propagation is determined primarily by the transverse part of the permittivity tensor , while the longitudinal components of the tensor are higher - order infinitesimals in the interaction constant @xmath2 @xcite . in this way",
    "the permittivity tensor in anisotropic medium is a symmetric tensor of rank two .",
    "now we make an attempt of the qualitative consideration of the @xmath0-beam propagation in the anisotropic medium . as is well known that the imaginary components of permittivity tensor in anisotropic medium describe the absorption of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "the cross section @xmath3 depends on the linear polarization of @xmath0- quanta @xmath4 where the unit vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 determine the polarization plane of the @xmath0-quanta and some definite plane in single crystal ( the wave vector of the @xmath0-quanta lies in both planes ) .",
    "the formula ( 1 ) essentially determines a symmetric tensor of rank two , whose components we denote as @xmath7 .",
    "then the imaginary parts of the permittivity tensor components are @xmath8 where n is the atomic density of single crystal , c is the speed of light and @xmath9 is the @xmath0-quanta frequency .",
    "the real components of the permittivity tensor we can find with the help of the despersion relations @xcite @xmath10 as is seen from ( [ 1 ] ) the cross sections for @xmath0-quanta with direction of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular with respect to unit vector @xmath11 are different . as is well known that the ellipse is a geometric interpretation of the symmetric tensor .",
    "these ellipses are represented on fig.1 for three energies of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "let take the above - mentioned dichromatic laser wave as an example of the anisotropic medium .",
    "fig.1a illustrates the behavior of the absorption ellipses at different energies in case when linear polarizations of the both waves are parallel or perpendicular with respect to unit vector @xmath6 .",
    "fig.1b illustrates the similar behavior , but the angle between polarizations of the two waves is not equal to 0 or @xmath12 . in both cases",
    "the cross sections are described by the equation ( [ 1 ] ) . however , in the case on fig.1a the common symmetric plane exists for all energies of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "this is true because of the natural symmetry of the problem .",
    "as fig.1.b illustrates , in this case the symmetric plane also exists but the position of the plane in space is different for every energy of @xmath0-quanta . in particular the position of this plane",
    "depends on the ratio of intensities of the dichromatic wave components .",
    "it is obviously that the symmetry plane is determined in main by the strong wave when the intensity one of two waves is very weak in the comparison with another .",
    "in such a manner , in this case the symmetry have the dynamic character , which defined by the particular mechanism of the interaction . the numerical quantities of this interaction are different for every energy of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "hence it follows that dynamic symmetry plane rotate at changing of the @xmath0-quanta energy .",
    "we can see from eq([3 ] ) that real components of permittivity tensor is determined by the integration over all energies of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "it is means that in general the position of the symmetry plane for real permittivity tensor differ from the similar position for imaginary part of this tensor . in other words ,",
    "the axes of both tensors are not parallel or perpendicular in between .",
    "hence we get that in general the preferred two planes exist in a space for propagating @xmath0-quanta of a fixed energy .    as is well known that @xmath0-beam in a medium present the superposition of two states .",
    "these states referred as normal electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "the normal waves are the eigenfunctions of the problem and they have determinate polarization characteristics , which depend on the optical properties of a medium .",
    "so , the @xmath0-quanta , having the polarization characteristics identical to one of normal waves , are conserve their at the propagation in a medium .",
    "in general the speeds of absorption of normal waves are different .",
    "it is evidently that both normal waves are linearly polarized in case illustrated in fig.1a .",
    "these polarizations are perpendicular in between and their directions coincide with the principal axes of ellipses . in other case",
    "( see fig.1b ) , in general the principal axes of both ellipses are not parallel , and it is believed that normal wave are elliptically polarized .",
    "it is also follows from paper @xcite . in the case ,",
    "when the absorption in medium is absent , the all imaginary components of permittivity tensor are equal to zero and because of this the normal waves are always linearly polarized .    in the general case the initial polarization state of @xmath0-quanta changes at propagation in a medium .",
    "the intensity of @xmath0-beam on thickness x in the anisotropic medium can calculate by the help of follows relation @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the initial stokes parameters of @xmath0-quanta , a , b , c , d are simple functions of x including also some parameters as , for example , refractive indices of normal waves .",
    "when the normal waves have only linear polarization the function c(x ) is equal to zero on any thickness x. in the case , when the normal waves have nonzero component of circular polarization the function c(x ) is equal to zero at x = 0 and in general it is nonzero at @xmath15 . besides , the first derivative of the c(x)-function is equal to zero at @xmath16 .",
    "it means that the cross section of the absorption process independent of the circular polarization of the @xmath0-quanta . here",
    "we employ the well - known formula @xmath17 for thin targets .    in this way",
    "the relation ( [ 4 ] ) show that intensity of @xmath0-quanta propagating in the anisotropic medium depends on the initial polarization despite the fact that the cross section of absorption is independent of it .",
    "the reason is that the normal waves are elliptically polarized .",
    "the speeds of absorption and motion of both the normal waves are different due to the process @xmath0-quanta propagation depends on the initial polarization state . on the other hand",
    "the initially unpolarized @xmath0-beam became elliptically polarized @xcite .",
    "this is an essential prerequisite for creating of the @xmath0- polarimeter .",
    "to do this requires computations of the @xmath0-quanta propagation in single crystals .",
    "in this section we present some results of the calculations of @xmath0-beam propagation in silicon single crystals .",
    "the investigated process is determined with the help of such parameters as refractive indices and polarization states of normal electromagnetic waves .",
    "the imaginary parts of refractive indices are responsible for the speed of normal wave absorption .",
    "the real parts and polarization states of normal waves are also in term c(x ) ( see equation ( [ 4 ] ) ) .",
    "let us define the polarization state of one normal wave with the help of stokes parameters @xmath18 .",
    "then the polarization state of another wave is correspondingly equal to @xmath19 .",
    "intuition suggest that the parameter @xmath20 should be significant for circular polarization detection . as it is follows from @xcite parameter @xmath21 is significant when @xmath0-beam moving under no large angle with respect to any strong crystallographic axis .",
    "we select the @xmath22 axis in silicon for calculations .",
    "we also select the cartesian coordinate system with one axis along @xmath22 axis and two another axes along @xmath23 and @xmath24 axes .",
    "direction of @xmath0-quanta motion we can determine with the use of angle @xmath25 with respect to @xmath22 axis and azimuth angle @xmath2 around of this axis ( @xmath26 , when the @xmath0-quanta momentum lies in the @xmath27-plane ) .",
    "however another angles are more convenient to use @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristics of process have the same numerical values at different @xmath0-quanta energies @xmath29 when the following invariant parameters are used : @xmath30 @xmath31 . here @xmath32 is the electron mass , @xmath33 are the reciprocal lattice constants ( in our case @xmath34 in units of the inverse electron compton length ) . in the case being considered we can write these parameters as @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the calculations are carried out for @xmath36 .",
    "the figs.2 - 6 illustrate these results of calculations . in the calculations",
    "the moliere form factor was employed @xcite .",
    "as fig.3 illustrates , the regions with high circular polarization @xmath20 exist in single crystals .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath20 is near 1 at @xmath37 mrad and @xmath38 mrad .",
    "we can see that the high quantity of @xmath20 is observed in region @xmath39 with respect to central @xmath40 , @xmath41-values .",
    "the direction , in which the circular polarization @xmath20 is equal to 1 , is the direction of the so - called singular axis , described in the crystal optic of the visible light @xcite .",
    "we can see in fig.2 that refractive indices are approximately equal to one another near this direction .",
    "notice , that the value @xmath42 , as a function of invariant @xmath43-parameters , is independent of the @xmath0-quanta energy .",
    "the @xmath44-value is determined in @xcite , and for the silicon single crystal is numerically equal to @xmath45 .",
    "fig.5 illustrates the variation of polarization state of the propagating @xmath0-quanta .",
    "we can see that the initially unpolarized beam obtain in general the linear and circular polarization .",
    "notice , that equations of paper @xcite break down for @xmath46 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however they are true in the neighborhood of this point and our calculations are made for @xmath47 .",
    "figs.4 and 6 illustrate the absolute and relative losses of @xmath0-quanta intensity .",
    "one can see that these losses depend on the initial polarization of the @xmath0-quanta .",
    "we select the value @xmath48 as the degree of relative losses of intensity , where @xmath49 is the losses of initially unpolarized beam and @xmath50 is the losses of completely circularly polarized beam .",
    "notice , that the initial polarization of @xmath0-quanta is not needed to change for measuring of the asymmetry @xmath51 .",
    "so , let @xmath0-beam is completely circularly polarized at the entry of the single crystal which have the orientation angles are equal to @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "after measuring the intensity losses we change the single crystal orientation so , that new angles are equal to @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ". then we get that @xmath56 .",
    "as already noted , the symmetry of problem have in general the dynamic character .",
    "it is means that our knowledge of such characteristics as refractive indices and @xmath57-values depends on the possible of uncertainty in the initial data for calculations .",
    "we think that main uncertainty is connected with the electric fields of single crystals .",
    "we carry out calculations of @xmath20-value with the use of experimental silicon form factors@xcite , instead moliere ones .",
    "the results of these calculations agree closely with each other .",
    "however , a little displacement of the singular axis direction ( when @xmath58 ) take a place ( in this case @xmath59 , instead @xmath60 for moliere potential ) .",
    "the results of calculations in the silicon single crystal oriented near @xmath22 axis show detectable sensitivity to the circular polarization of propagating @xmath0-quanta . below we discuss some questions of the limitations and optimization .",
    "our consideration of the process are based on the traditional theory of the coherent @xmath61-pair production in single crystals @xcite .",
    "however , this process is transformed into the analogous process in a `` strong field '' of the crystallographic axis @xcite and the mathematical description of the both processes is different .",
    "the process in the `` strong field '' take a place at angles @xmath62 with respect to axis , where @xmath63 is the potential of this axis . in the case of @xmath22 silicon axis",
    "this angle is equal to @xmath64 mrad .",
    "it is means that the upper bound for our consideration ( @xmath22,si ) is @xmath65 .",
    "we believe that the asymmetry of process @xmath66 on the same thickness is growing with the @xmath0-quanta energy increasing .",
    "it is true because of the increasing of the cross section of the @xmath0-beam absorption .",
    "as fig.6 illustrates , the detectable value @xmath66 take a place for orientations with not high quantity of the @xmath20-value .",
    "this orientation region is more wide and flat then region near singular axis .",
    "it is important for measuring polarization of the @xmath0-beam with a large angle divergence .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath67 and @xmath68 axes in silicon single crystals have more strong electric fields , then @xmath69 axis . because of this",
    ", it is expected more high @xmath66-values for these axes .",
    "we believe that the theoretical prerequisites exist for creating @xmath70-polarimeters on the base of the considered here phenomenon .",
