    "x - ray observations of supernova remnants ( snrs ) have revealed a number of radio - quiet central compact objects ( ccos  see pavlov et al .   2002a , 2004 for a review )",
    "whose nature remains enigmatic .",
    "they are characterized by soft , apparently thermal , x - ray spectra and a lack of manifestations of pulsar activity ( e.g. , radio and/or @xmath7-ray emission , compact synchrotron nebulae ) .",
    "most likely , ccos are neutron stars ( nss ) formed in supernova explosions .",
    "one of the best investigated ccos is 1e 1207.45209 ( 1e1207 hereafter ) in the g296.5 + 10.0 (= pks 120951/52 ) snr .",
    "it was discovered by helfand & becker ( 1984 ) with the _ einstein _ observatory .",
    "mereghetti , bignami & caraveo ( 1996 ) and vasisht et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpreted the _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ spectra of 1e1207 as blackbody emission of a ( redshifted ) temperature @xmath8  kev from an area with radius @xmath9  km at @xmath10 kpc .",
    "mereghetti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) put upper limits of @xmath11  mjy for 4.8 ghz radio flux , @xmath12 photons @xmath13 s@xmath4 for @xmath14 mev @xmath7-rays , and @xmath15 for an optical counterpart .",
    "zavlin , pavlov & trmper ( 1998 ) showed that the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ spectra are consistent with hydrogen or helium ns atmosphere models .",
    "for a ns of mass @xmath16 and radius 10 km , they obtained a ns surface temperature @xmath170.16 kev , where @xmath18 is the gravitational redshift at the ns surface , and a distance 1.63.3 kpc , compatible with the distance to the snr , @xmath19 kpc ( giacani et al .",
    "2000 ) .    first _",
    "observation of 1e1207 in january 2000 with a 30 ks exposure allowed us to detect a period @xmath20 s ( frequency @xmath21 hz ) , which proved that the source is indeed a ns , with a period typical for an ordinary radio pulsar ( zavlin et al .",
    "2000 ; paper i hereafter ) .",
    "the pulsar was again observed with _",
    "chandra _ for 30 ks in january 2002 .",
    "this observation showed a longer period , @xmath22 s ( @xmath23 hz ) , corresponding to the period derivative @xmath24 s s@xmath4 ( pavlov et al .",
    "2002b ; paper ii hereafter ) .",
    "such a period derivative implies a characteristic age , @xmath25 kyr , much larger than the 320 kyr age of the snr ( roger et al .",
    "1988 ) , which suggests that the pulsar was born with a period only slightly faster than its current value . the conventional magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath26 g , and the spin - down energy loss rate , @xmath27 erg s@xmath4 , inferred from the @xmath28 , @xmath29 values , are typical for radio pulsars .",
    "even more surprising finding from the two _ chandra _ observations was the discovery of absorption lines , first lines detected in the spectrum of an isolated ns ( sanwal et al .",
    "two firmly detected lines , at 0.7 kev and 1.4 kev , could be interpreted as absorption lines of once - ionized helium in a very strong magnetic field , about @xmath30 g , which requires a gravitational redshift @xmath311.23 ( sanwal et al .",
    "another interpretation , that the lines could be associated with transitions in he - like oxygen ions in a magnetic field @xmath32 g , was discussed by hailey & mori ( 2002 ) . a possible third line , at about 2 kev ( sanwal et al .",
    "2002a ) , unfortunately coincides with the ir m line from the telescope mirror coating , where the calibration is inaccurate .",
    "if this line is due to the source , then the three lines might be the fundamental and two harmonics of the electron cyclotron absorption in a magnetic field @xmath33 g. sanwal et al .",
    "( 2002a ) discussed this possibility and concluded that it is difficult to reconcile this interpretation with the much higher magnetic field estimated from @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and with the very low oscillator strengths of cyclotron harmonics .",
    "first observation of 1e1207 with   ( 27 ks exposure ) was performed in december 2001 .",
    "mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) confirmed the absorption lines and reported on their pulse phase variations .",
    "the period value was in agreement with that measured in the second _ chandra _ observation , taken 13 days later .",
    "1e1207 was again observed with   in august 2002 ( 258 ks of total exposure ) .",
    "based on this very deep observation , bignami et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported positive detection of the 2.1 kev absorption line and marginal detection of a 2.8 kev line in the source spectrum .",
    "the detection of three ( possibly four ) evenly spaced lines argues for the above - mentioned cyclotron interpretation , although it remains unclear how the cyclotron harmonics can form in the relatively cold plasma with the low magnetic field .",
    "timing analysis of these data ( described below ) provides a highly accurate period that is _ shorter _ than the period measured in the first  observation , indicating that the pulsar is not spinning down steadily .    finally , _",
    "chandra _ observed this puzzling pulsar two times in june 2003 for 280 ks of total exposure .",
    "these observations were primarily designed to measure the phase - dependent spectrum with a high energy resolution .",
    "however , they also provided timing information that we use to assess the evolution of the pulsar s period .",
    "we describe the  and _ chandra _ observations and present results of our timing analysis in  2 .",
    "possible interpretations are discussed in  3 .",
    "the results are summarized in  4 .",

    "first timing results for the  observation of december 2001 have been presented by mereghetti et al .",
    "to evaluate the most plausible frequency and its uncertainty in a statistically rigorous way , and for the sake of uniformity , we reanalyzed these data with the same approach as in papers i and ii , using the method of gregory & loredo ( 1996 ) based on the bayesian formalism .",
    "while this method yields frequency estimates consistent with those given by other techniques ( e.  g. , the simple epoch - folding @xmath34 and rayleigh @xmath35 tests ) , it has several important advantages .",
    "it is free of any assumption on pulse shape , that results in more accurate determination of signal frequency and its uncertainty .",

    "it is easy to check that the time dependence of the pulsation frequency in the 3.45 yr interval can not be satisfactorily fitted by a straight line , @xmath134 , for any of the three possible frequency values obtained in the third _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the best fit , with @xmath135 @xmath43hz , @xmath136 s@xmath69 ( @xmath137 mjd ) , is obtained assuming the correct frequency in june 2003 is given by peak a ( see the dotted line in fig .",
    "3 ) ; the fit corresponds to @xmath138 ( for 3 degrees of freedom ) and can be rejected at a 4.1@xmath40 level ( if one assumes the frequency of peak b for the third _ chandra _ observation , then the rejection level is 5.6@xmath40 ) .",
    "this means that 1e1207 is not spinning down steadily , as most radio pulsars do .",
    "we discuss possible explanations below .",
    "some radio pulsars and axps occasionally show sudden increases in pulsation frequency , commonly known as `` glitches '' , with various patterns of post - glitch behavior ( e.g. , lyne , shemar & graham - smith 2000 ; gavriil & kaspi 2002 ) .",
    "the relative frequency jumps , @xmath139 , vary from @xmath140 to @xmath141 in different pulsars .",
    "obviously , the non - monotonous behavior of @xmath142 , inferred from the above - described timing of 1e1207 , may suggest that the pulsar experienced a number of glitches during the 3.45 yr time span . assuming the glitches are not associated with a substantial change of frequency derivative @xmath75 , at least two glitches are required , between january and august 2002 ( 212 days interval ) , and between august 2002 and june 2003 ( 313 days interval ) .",
    "the values of the frequency jumps depend on the value of @xmath75 assumed , which in turn depends on the cumulative frequency change in glitches that might occur in the 716 days interval between january 2000 and december 2001 .",
    "for instance , if there were no glitches in that interval , then @xmath143 s@xmath69 , and the two frequency jumps , of about 7 @xmath43hz and 5 @xmath43hz , are required to fit the data ( the latter value assumes that the correct frequency in 2003 june 1019 is given by the central peak b of the probability distribution  see fig .",
    "the larger of these jumps ( @xmath144 ) , is similar to the strong glitches observed in the vela pulsar ( dodson , mcgulloch & lewis 2002 ) and the axp 1e  2259 + 586 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ) , and it is a factor of 5 smaller than the giant glitch recently observed in psr j1806@xmath02125 ( hobbs et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "given that at least two glitches are required in the 525 day interval , it seems reasonable to assume that the pulsar was also glitching in the 717 day interval between the first two observations , which would correspond to a larger @xmath145 and stronger glitches .",
    "for instance , if the cumulative frequency increase due to glitches was 30 @xmath43hz in 717 days , then @xmath146 s@xmath69 , and the two frequency jumps ( in 525 days after january 2002 ) are about 16 @xmath43hz and 18 @xmath43hz ( @xmath147 ) . although the relative frequency jumps of the separate glitches are smaller than for the largest glitch observed ( hobbs et al .",
    "2002 ) , the integrated amplitude of the glitches is a factor of 3060 greater then the typical value , @xmath148 ( @xmath149 is the total time span , equal to 3.45 yr in our case ) observed for glitching radio pulsars ( lyne et al .",
    "2000 ) . therefore , although we can not formally rule out the possibility that 1e1207 experiences glitches of @xmath150hz , with a characteristic rate of @xmath1510.51 glitches per year , such a hypothesis implies that the nature of the glitches in this unusual object is different from that observed in radio pulsars .",
    "in addition , to explain the probable increase of frequency between the two orbits in the  observation of august 2002 ( see  2.2 ) , we have to assume that a small glitch of @xmath152hz occurred in the short 73 ks gap , which looks artificial .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the glitch hypothesis implies a smaller characteristic age ( e.g. , @xmath153 kyr in the last example ) , bringing it closer to the snr age , and larger magnetic field ( @xmath154 ) and spin - down energy loss ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the spin evolution of a ns can also be affected by a flow of material streaming to the ns from an accretion disk . the analysis presented in  3.3 below rules out an accreting close binary , but",
    "the accreting material could be supplied from a `` fossil '' accretion disk formed from ejecta produced in the supernova explosion ( see marsden , lingenfelter & rotschild 2001 for references ) .",
    "the accretion can proceed in two regimes ( e.g. , frank , king , & raine 2002 ) , depending on the relation between the corotation radius @xmath156 ( here @xmath157 hz is the spin frequency ) and magnetospheric radius @xmath158 ( here @xmath159 g s@xmath4 is the accretion rate , @xmath160 g @xmath161 is the ns magnetic moment , and the ns mass is assumed to be @xmath162 ) . if the accretion rate is so high that @xmath163 , the accreting matter can overcome the centrifugal barrier and reach the ns surface .",
    "in this `` accretor regime '' the torque exerted on the magnetosphere spins the ns up ( @xmath164 ) . at @xmath165 , the centrifugal force at @xmath166",
    "exceeds the gravitational force , so that accretion onto the ns surface is inhibited .",
    "in this `` propeller regime '' the infalling material is accelerated away from the magnetosphere reducing the angular momentum of the ns ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "at even lower @xmath168 , @xmath169 approaches the light cylinder radius , @xmath170 cm , where the pressure of the magneto - dipole radiation of the rotating ns takes over the accretion pressure and prevents any accretion ( `` ejector regime '' ) .",
    "the torque caused by accretion in both the propeller and accretor regimes can be conveniently approximated , at @xmath171 , as @xmath172 ( e.g. , menou et al .",
    "1999 ) , where @xmath173 hz is the spin frequency at which the propeller - accretor transition occurs ( @xmath174 at @xmath175 ) . the corresponding frequency derivative , @xmath176 , is @xmath177 for the ns moment of inertia @xmath178 g @xmath179 . the curves of constant @xmath75 values in different regimes are shown in figure 4 .    if the observed variations of @xmath75 are due to accretion , the accretion rate should vary with time .",
    "moreover , to explain the very plausible _ spin - up _ between december 2001 and august 2002 ( see  2.2 ) , we have to assume , in the framework of this simple model , that 1e1207 was in the accretor regime during at least part of that time interval .",
    "figure 4 shows that in order to provide the corresponding @xmath180 s@xmath69 , the accretion rate should be high enough , @xmath181 g s@xmath4 ( @xmath182 [ @xmath183 is the rate of accretion onto the ns surface ) .",
    "because accretion onto the ns surface provides an additional luminosity @xmath184 erg s@xmath4 , which substantially exceeds the observed x - ray luminosity , @xmath185 erg s@xmath4 in the 0.35 kev range ( @xmath186 $ ] ) , we have to assume that 1e1207 was in the propeller stage during all the available x - ray observations , while it perhaps was in the accretion stage ( accompanied by an unnoticed outburst ) between january and august of 2002 .",
    "( this outburst plays the same role as the 7 @xmath43hz glitch assumed in the glitching interpretation . )    assuming no other accretion outbursts occurred in the 3.45 yr of the _ chandra _ and  observations , typical spin - down rates are in the range of @xmath187@xmath188 s@xmath69 . according to figure 4 , in the propeller regime",
    "they correspond to @xmath189@xmath190 g s@xmath4 and @xmath191@xmath192 g @xmath161 ( or @xmath32@xmath193 g for a centered magnetic dipole ) .",
    "the higher values of @xmath168 from the above range are hardly plausible because such strong accretion onto the magnetosphere should be accompanied by emission ( presumably , optically thin bremsstrahlung ",
    "see wang & robertson 1985 ) with a luminosity @xmath194 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the lack of such emission in the observed data means that @xmath195@xmath196 g s@xmath4 . at lower @xmath168 ( @xmath197 g s@xmath4 )",
    ", the x - ray pulsar approaches the propeller - ejector boundary , where the propeller spin - down becomes less efficient but the radio pulsar can turn on . if @xmath168 varies around this boundary , 1e1207 can occasionally manifest radio - pulsar activity .    in the propeller regime",
    ", we can expect variations of the accretion rate comparable with its average value , to explain the variations of @xmath75 .",
    "if a fraction of @xmath168 accretes onto the ns surface ( which is possible even in the propeller regime  e.g. , menou et al .",
    "1999 ) , it could contribute to the observed x - ray luminosity and lead to its variations .",
    "the fact that the observations of 1e1207 at different epochs do not reveal significant changes in its x - ray flux allows one to constrain this fraction .",
    "for instance , the difference between the fluxes derived from the two  observations does not exceed 1% , which corresponds to @xmath198 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath199 .",
    "observations of 1e1207 with different x - ray observatories show flux differences of up to 30% , but they can likely be explained by systematic uncertainties in instrument calibrations .",
    "strong constraints on the properties of the putative accretion disk can be obtained from optical observations of 1e1207 . using a standard approach ( e.g. , frank et al .",
    "2002 ) , we can estimate the effective temperature of a geometrically thin , optically thick disk as @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the temperature at the inner edge of disk , at @xmath202 .",
    "the spectrum of such a disk , in the blackbody approximation , is @xmath203 - 1}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath204 is the disk inclination .",
    "we calculated the spectral flux @xmath205 and the corresponding @xmath206 magnitude on a @xmath43-@xmath168 grid and plotted the lines of constant @xmath206 in figure 4 for @xmath207 , @xmath208 kpc , adding a plausible extinction @xmath209 .",
    "the results are insensitive to the value of the outer radius @xmath210 when it exceeds @xmath211 cm ( we used @xmath212 cm in this calculation ) .",
    "figure 4 shows that , for the face - on disk , expected magnitudes in the accretor and propeller regimes are @xmath21319 and @xmath21423 , respectively . to reconcile the magnitude estimates with the reported limit , @xmath215",
    ", we have to assume inclinations close to @xmath216 , which looks rather artificial . on the other hand",
    ", the inclination should not be too close to @xmath216 in order the disk periphery not to obscure the x - ray source : @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the vertical scale - height of the disk , in the thin disk model .    to conclude",
    ", the accretion hypothesis can , in principle , explain the observed variations of pulsation frequency and give some constraints on the magnetic field , but it implies that 1e1207 is a transient x - ray source , which has not been observed , and requires extreme inclinations of the accretion disk .",
    "another plausible explanation for the observed frequency variation is that 1e1207 resides in a binary system .",
    "the orbital motion would result in a periodic modulation of the observed frequency due to the doppler shift .",
    "we can put some limits on the nature of the binary system and the companion of 1e1207 from the available x - ray and optical observations .    using our timing results",
    ", we can constrain the amplitude @xmath219 of the orbital modulation and the orbital period @xmath220 . the observed deviations from a steady spin - down imply @xmath221 @xmath43hz ( larger @xmath219 values can not be formally excluded but seem hardly plausible , given the range of the measured frequencies ) . to see a significant deviation from the steady spin - down over the 3.45 yr time span",
    ", the orbital period should not be larger than about 6 years , for @xmath222 @xmath43hz .",
    "on the other hand , the orbital period should substantially exceed the time spans of the long observations of august 2002 ( @xmath223 d ) and june 2003 ( @xmath224 d ) that do not show frequency variations except for the linear term , @xmath225 . to estimate a lower limit on @xmath220",
    ", we repeated the timing analysis of these two observations for a large number of models with sinusoidally modulated @xmath142 .",
    "the lower limit , naturally , grows with increasing @xmath219 , and it strongly depends on the assumed orbital phase . for example , we obtained @xmath226 for @xmath227 @xmath43hz .",
    "this gives the lowest possible period of @xmath228 d , for a special choice of orbital phase , while the lower limit is significantly larger , @xmath229100 d , for a broad range of orbital phases .",
    "we also attempted to constrain the lower limit on @xmath220 fitting the time dependence @xmath230\\ ] ] ( which assumes a circular orbit ) to all five timing points shown in figure 3 and requiring the model to be consistent with the timing data in each individual data set .",
    "this resulted in a ` global lower limit ' @xmath231 d.    within the possible period boundaries , multiple combinations of orbital parameters can give `` perfect fits '' to the scarce timing observations .",
    "we present three representative solutions in figure 5 .",
    "these solutions correspond the following parameters in equation ( 11 ) : @xmath232 @xmath43hz , @xmath233 s@xmath69 , @xmath234 @xmath43hz , @xmath235 d and @xmath236 d ( model i ) , @xmath237 @xmath43hz , @xmath238 s@xmath69 , @xmath239 @xmath43hz , @xmath240 d and @xmath241 d ( model ii ) , and @xmath242 @xmath43hz , @xmath243 s@xmath69 , @xmath244 @xmath43hz , @xmath245 d and @xmath246 d ( model iii ) , with time @xmath247 counted from mjd 51500.0 .",
    "i assumes that the correct frequency in the observation of june 2003 is given by peak a ( see  2.3 and fig .  1 ) , whereas the more probable frequency of peak b is chosen for the two other models .",
    "we note that in these examples the characteristic pulsar age , @xmath248 , ranges from 466 to 2335 kyr ; it is still significantly larger than the 20-kyr upper limit on the age of the snr . to reconcile the ages in the framework of this simple model , one would need a very large , and rather implausible , orbital modulation @xmath249 @xmath43hz .",
    "the above estimates show that 1e1207 could be a wide binary with a long period , @xmath2506 yr , and the component separation , @xmath251 au , where @xmath252 and @xmath253 are masses of the ns and its companion , respectively .",
    "the plausible amplitudes of @xmath219 correspond to rather small amplitudes of radial velocity , @xmath254 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the mass function of the binary can be estimated as @xmath255 .",
    "for @xmath256 , this gives @xmath257 .",
    "we see that for reasonably large inclinations the secondary star should have a very low mass , in the range of brown dwarf or m - dwarf masses , with a lower limit as small as 6 jupiter masses .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath258 can be estimated from optical observations .",
    "for instance , the limiting magnitude @xmath215 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "1996 ) implies the absolute @xmath206 magnitude @xmath259 ( for @xmath208 kpc and a plausible extinction @xmath209 ) , corresponding to an m dwarf later than m3m4 ( mass @xmath260@xmath261 ) or a white dwarf ( of any allowed white dwarf mass , @xmath262 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the timing results can be explained by the binary hypothesis if either the mass of the secondary is very low or the inclination is very small .",
    "similar to the case of glitches , the intrinsic @xmath75 ( hence the characteristic age , spin - down energy loss , and magnetic field ) can be quite different from the values inferred in paper ii from two _ chandra _ observations .",
    "it should be noted that a low mass of the secondary implies that the pre - supernova binary had a very eccentric orbit , with the secondary close to aphelion at the moment of explosion , in order for the binary to survive .",
    "therefore , such low - mass binaries in snrs should be a very rare case .",
    "the only potential low - mass binary with a young ns is the central object of the snr rcw 103 , but likely it is a short - period ( @xmath263 hr ) , accreting binary ( sanwal et al .",
    "we note also that if 1e1207 is indeed in a wide binary system , we would not see manifestations of binarity other than the timing properties .",
    "our timing analysis of the _ chandra _ and  observations , spread over a 3.45 yr time span , has shown a non - monotonous frequency evolution of 1e1207 . to explain the observed deviations from the steady spin - down , we have discussed three hypotheses .",
    "the first one , that the neutron star is a glitching pulsator , requires an unusually large time - integrated amplitude of glitches to explain the observed variations in the spin frequency .",
    "the second hypothesis assumes variable accretion from a dim fossil ( residual ) disk around the pulsar and implies that 1e1207 is a transient x - ray source that can occasionally increase its brightness by at least three orders of magnitudes , which has never been observed .",
    "the deep limit on optical emission from 1e1207 implies that such a disk is seen almost edge - on .",
    "the third hypothesis is that 1e1207 resides in a wide binary system with a low - mass companion that has not yet been detected .",
    "a binary with such a companion could survive the supernova explosion only at very special conditions .",
    "thus , all three hypotheses imply rather exotic properties of 1e1207 , but none of them can be firmly ruled out .",
    "we consider the binary hypothesis as somewhat more plausible than the other two , but only further observations can tell us which ( if any ) of these interpretations is correct .",
    "the most direct way to understand the true nature of 1e1207 is to monitor its timing behavior in a dedicated _ chandra _ or  program .",
    "additional useful constraints on the nature of the putative low - mass companion or accretion disk can be obtained from extremely deep optical / ir observations .",
    "finally , it would be worthwhile to carry out a series of very deep radio observations to look for a possible transient radio pulsar .",
