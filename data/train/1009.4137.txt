    "therefore , as @xmath0 approaches @xmath97 , band - gap effects tend to disappear in the whole optical spectrum and the scattering of the incident spp by the ridge array , can be interpreted , mainly , as the individual scattering of the first one or two ridges .      as found for individual grooves , the scattering coefficients of grooves arrays",
    "have an oscillatory behavior that depends on the depth of the grooves and the free - space wavelength of the incident spp .",
    "several works @xcite have studied spp scattering by groove arrays . in order to compare with the ridge array analyzed before , in the following",

    "+ first of all in fig.[grooves50 ] we present the exact result for the array of grooves considered in ref . [ ] with an approximate method .",
    "the two results are extremely similar , except that the radiation growth within the band - gap is much more evident in the exact result than in the approximate one .",
    "noticeably fig.[grooves50 ] features the same radiation peak at @xmath99 as fig.[ridges50 ] . + as opposed to the individual behavior of a resonant groove , in groove arrays the reflection and radiation maxima are effectively decoupled , when the grooves are interacting collectively .",
    "in fact , in this case the reflection peak is imposed at @xmath100 by bragg s interference , based on the period of the array .",
    "however , since the radiation peak is caused by the decrease of the reflection ( and transmission ) within the gap the two peaks appear at different wavelengths , unless the spectral width of the band - gap is zero .",
    "+ when , in the same configuration , the depth of the grooves is increased up to @xmath91 , the interaction between the incident spp and the groove weakens . as a result the related reflection maximum is systematically reduced , as seen in fig.[groovesr50200](a ) .",
    "figure [ groovesr50200](b ) shows that the radiation maximum at @xmath101 disappears .",
    "similarly , as @xmath0 increases , the radiation also vanishes throughout the spectrum @xmath66 $ ] .",

    "note the small reflection peak at @xmath104 is the only one decoupled from radiative emission lines .",
    "comparison with fig.[grnoabs ] suggests that the interaction between the 5 grooves in fig.[grooves1000 nm ] is weak and that the scattering produced by the array is rather a superposition of the individual behavior of each groove .",
    "the comparison between the two figures also shows that the values of radiation peaks are about 60% in fig.[grooves1000 nm ] and about 30% in fig.[grnoabs ] .",
    "that is , at resonance , the fraction of impinging spp flux radiated by five grooves doubles the one radiated by a single groove , of the same size .",
    "besides radiating more efficiently , five grooves produce more dissipation of the impinging spp energy flux than one does , and this causes less overall transmission throughout the spectrum in fig.[grooves1000 nm ] . + finally",

    "tall ridges dissipate less of the spp energy , achieving a maximum reflection efficiency over 90% .",
