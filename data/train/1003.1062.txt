    "apparently , the typical level splittings at the avoided crossings [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_clean](b , c ) ] are dramatically enhanced in the high - field regime .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as compared to the low - field case , the amplitudes of wave functions are enhanced at the dot boundary [ see fig .  [",

    "in other words avoided crossings appear when the energy of eigenstates evolving towards the @xmath90 level `` pass '' through the energy @xmath91 of the first landau level [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_hard](c ) ] . due to a large number of avoided crossings , there are no states continuously following the first landau level .",
    "we rather observe a bundle of states sequentially moving along the characteristic energy of the first landau level , much like in a relay [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : ev_hard](c ) ] .",
    "such an interrelated sequence of avoided crossings is well - known from atomic physics as `` diabatic ridge '' - riding states localized on potential barriers.@xcite a direct consequence is that the evolution of eigenstates for an increasing magnetic field [ see green highlighted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_hard](a ) ] features sharp `` kinks '' when crossing the ridge following the first landau level [ see arrow in fig .  [",
    "fig : ev_hard](c ) ] . as the state",
    "is transiently trapped by the ridge , it moves away from the dirac point , and continues again monotonically towards the dirac point once clear of the ridge .",
    "these kinks due to the ridge riding mechanism have been observed in the experiment@xcite serving as an additional indicator for the position of the lowest landau level and the electron - hole crossover .",
    "the present results show that the atomically sharp edges destroy the linear @xmath0-dependence of the energy levels at weak fields , but they do preserve the square - root @xmath0-dependence at very high fields .",
    "the linear @xmath0 dependence results from the fragile suppression of @xmath2   scattering ( @xmath92 ) between the dirac cones while the square - root dependence results from the much more robust dispersion relation of the individual cone . therefore , landau levels survive the introduction of sharp boundaries much better than the energy levels at weak fields . in turn , even when in the experiment a dirac - like landau level spectrum is recorded , many other features of the same graphene sample may very well show large deviations from predictions based on dirac theory .      to further elucidate the role of lattice symmetry breaking in graphene quantum dots",
    ", we now consider isolated lattice defects in the bulk .",
    "the preceding results suggest that disorder realizations that break the @xmath2  symmetry are of crucial importance .",

    "overall , the diamagnetic spectrum closely resembles that of clean samples with atomically sharp edges ( see fig .",

    "such localized states can therefore be expected to behave differently from the bulk landau levels .",
    "the resulting ridges feature a very weak quasi - linear magnetic field dependence .",

    "@xcite    in the low field regime , we observe a significant change in the @xmath0-evolution of eigenenergies : avoided crossings become asymmetric [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_disorder](b ) ] .",

    "( [ e_pert_kk ] ) is different [ see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : es_clean ] .",

    "accordingly , @xmath109 is , indeed , strongly dependent on the amount of @xmath2  scatterers , not on the overall number of defects .",
    "the decrease in peak height with increasing @xmath2  scattering should thus provide a robust and sensitive measure for @xmath2  scattering present in the experiment .    to test this conjecture ,",
    "we have measured the evolution of 42 coulomb blockade peaks for varying magnetic field.@xcite we follow the parametric motion of the peak positions , and hence the eigenstate energies , as a function of magnetic field @xmath117$]t . to compare with our numerical results , we take into account a charging energy of 13  mev ( determined independently@xcite ) as well as spin ( by zeeman splitting ) .",
    "we observe , indeed , a quadratic @xmath0-field dependence rather than the linear dependence predicted for conserved @xmath2  symmetry of the dirac equation .",

    "[ fig : summary](c , d ) ] .",
    "this has important consequences for the interpretation of experimental data : the roughness present in the experimental dot does not allow to disentangle @xmath28 and @xmath32 states . to be more quantitative , we compare our simulations for the level variance with experimental data .",
    "we indeed find good agreement as confirmed by a noticeable peak also in the experimental data for @xmath118 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : experiment](b ) ] .",
    "the offset between the two data sets in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment](b ) is attributed to a possible energy dependence of @xmath119 scattering as well as statistical fluctuations in charging energy and in the number of localized states for different values of the back gate voltage . by using the edge roughness @xmath102 as the only adjustable parameter",
    ", we can match the measured @xmath118 very well with our numerical simulation [ see lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : experiment](b ) ] .",
    "good agreement is found for an edge roughness of about @xmath120  nm , or , equivalently , a @xmath2  scatterer concentration in the bulk @xmath121 , both of which are well within expectation .",
    "we emphasize that , although we can quantify the resulting overall strength of @xmath2  coupling in our experimental quantum dot , we can not disentangle whether the observed @xmath2  scattering comes from edge roughness , lattice defects , or disorder through flake - substrate interactions with a length scale comparable to the lattice constant .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of eigenstates in graphene quantum dots with increasing magnetic field . concentrating on the energy regime around the dirac point ,",
    "we observe a smooth transition from a linear density of states to the emergence of landau levels . at high field strength , we find that landau levels follow the square - root dependence of the dirac equation , manifested in the energy level diagram by sequences of correlated avoided crossings along `` diabatic ridges ''",
    ". these ridges lead to characteristic kinks in the evolution of energy states that cross a landau level .",
    "appearing also in coulomb blockade measurements , these kinks can be used to experimentally pin down the electron - hole crossover point.@xcite in the perturbative regime of small magnetic fields , we find that the linear dependence on @xmath0 predicted by the model of massless dirac fermions disappears when the valley symmetry is broken .",
    "even perfect armchair and zigzag edges are sufficient to break the sublattice symmetry giving rise to avoided crossings with a quadratic dependence on @xmath0 instead .",
    "a similar effect is observed for lattice defects : single lattice vacancies break the @xmath2  symmetry and thus result in avoided crossings with substantial level splittings ( even for defect concentrations as low as 1 in 20.000 ) . by comparison with double vacancies which conserve the sublattice symmetry",
    "we show that it is not the presence of disorder per se which leads to deviations from predictions by the dirac equation , but the breaking of valley symmetry .",
    "we compare our theoretical predictions with experimental results on the parametric @xmath0-field evolution of coulomb blockade peaks . as a quantitative indicator for the strength of @xmath2  scattering",
    ", we identify the variance @xmath109 of the level spacing distribution .",
    "we observe a peak in the variance at @xmath1 due to level correlations near avoided crossings .",
    "we find quantitative agreement between the measured and the calculated data for @xmath109 which enables us to pinpoint the amount of @xmath2  scattering present in our experimental flake .",
    "the present results provide a sensitive indicator for the quality of the graphene dot and demonstrate the limits of the dirac picture in describing the experiment .",
