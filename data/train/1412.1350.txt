    "inverse problems for hyperbolic equations have been studied extensively using a geometric point of view , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that for a hyperbolic equation with time - independent coefficients , the travel time of the waves between two points defines a natural riemannian distance between these points .",
    "the corresponding riemannian metric is called the travel time metric .",
    "a classical inverse problem is to determine the wave speed inside the object given the travel times between the boundary points , or equivalently , the distances between the boundary points . in this paper",
    "we study geometric inverse problems for lorentzian manifolds , that are related to hyperbolic equations with time - depending coefficients and to general relativity . before formulating the geometric inverse problems for lorenzian manifolds that we will study ,",
    "let us recall earier results for riemannian manifolds .",
    "a paradigm problem is the boundary rigidity problem : does the restriction @xmath4 of the riemannian distance function @xmath5 determine uniquely a riemannian manifold with boundary @xmath6 .",
    "if this is possible , then @xmath7 is said to be boundary rigid . since the boundary distance function takes into account only the shortest paths , it is easy to construct counterexamples where @xmath4 does not carry information on an open subset of @xmath8 .",
    "thus some a - priori conditions on @xmath7 are necessary for boundary rigidity .",
    "michel has conjectured that simple manifolds are boundary rigid @xcite .",
    "we recall that a compact riemannian manifold with boundary @xmath7 is simple , if @xmath9 is strictly convex and if for any @xmath10 the exponential map @xmath11 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "pestov and uhlmann proved the conjecture in the dimension two @xcite but it is open in higher dimensions .",
    "a related problem to determine the @xmath12-jet of the metric tensor @xmath13 on the boundary from the riemannian distance function @xmath4 was solved for simple riemannian manifolds in @xcite . here",
    "we extend this result for lorentzian manifolds .",
    "our main motivation comes from the theory of relativity , whence we consider a lorentzian manifold without boundary , and replace the restriction of the riemannian distance function with the time separations between points on a timelike hypersurface .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath0 is a lorentzian manifold without boundary .",
    "the two main theorems of the paper concern determination of @xmath0 given time separations between points on a timelike hypersurface @xmath3 .",
    "our first result is of local nature : we show that the time separations determine the @xmath2-jet of the metric tensor @xmath14 at a point @xmath15 assuming that there are many timelike geodesics starting near @xmath16 and intersecting @xmath3 again later .",
    "the result is obtained by adapting the method developed in @xcite and @xcite to the lorentzian context .",
    "the method has been previously used only in the riemannian setting .",
    "our global result is that @xmath2-jet of the metric tensor at a point determines the universal loretzian covering space of @xmath0 assuming that @xmath0 is real - analytic and geodesically complete modulo scalar curvature singularities , see the definition before theorem 2 .",
    "the boundary distance rigidity question in the lorentzian context has been studied by anderson , dahl , and howard @xcite who have studied slab - like manifolds and show , in particular , that flat two dimensional product manifolds are boundary rigid , that is , the lorentzian distances of boundary points determine the manifold uniquely under natural assumptions . in the riemannian case , in addition to the above mentioned paper by pestov and uhlmann @xcite ,",
    "boundary rigidity has been proved for subdomains of euclidean space @xcite , for subspaces of an open hemisphere in two dimension @xcite , for subspaces of symmetric spaces of constant negative curvature @xcite , for two dimensional spaces of negative curvature @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that metrics a priori close to a metric in a generic set , which includes real - analytic metrics , are boundary rigid , and in @xcite it was shown that two metrics with identical boundary distance functions differ by an isometry which fixes the boundary if one of the metrics is close to the euclidean metric . for other results see @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the riemannian boundary rigidity problem is reduced to an inverse problem for the laplace - beltrami equation on a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "the solution of this problem is heavily based on the use of the underlying real - analytic conformal structure that the riemannian surfaces have @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will use similar kind of underlying real - analytic structure to study inverse problems for the stationary spacetimes .",
    "in addition to @xcite , the deteremination of the @xmath2-jet of the riemannian metric tensor has been studied in @xcite , where the problem of this type was considered for a class of non - simple manifolds , and the authors showed that knowledge of the lens data in a neighborhood of a boundary point determines @xmath12-jet of the metric at this point .",
