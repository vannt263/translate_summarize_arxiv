    "the iras vela shell is a ring - like structure seen clearly in the iras sky survey atlas ( issa ) in the 25 , 60 and 100 micron maps .",
    "this large feature extending almost 30 degrees in galactic longitude ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) , and discernable from the galactic plane till galactic latitude @xmath5 , was first noticed by a.  blaauw .",
    "subsequently , a detailed study of this region formed the major part of the thesis by sahu ( 1992 ) .",
    "this infrared shell is seen in projection against the gum nebula as a region of enhanced h@xmath6 emission in the southern part of the nebula .",
    "but it is quite likely that whereas the iras shell may be located in the vicinity of the gum nebula , it is unrelated to it .",
    "the main reason for supposing this is that the kinematics of the shell is quite different from that of the gum nebula as a whole .",
    "the evidence comes from emission line studies of this region ( e.g. , lines of nii ) . whereas there is no conclusive evidence of any expansion of the gum nebula , in two directions towards approximately the centre of the shell the emission lines have a `` double - peaked '' structure , consistent with an expansion with a velocity @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the gum nebula does not appear as a discernable feature in the iras maps .",
    "the shell roughly envelopes the vela ob2 stellar association ( brandt _ et al .",
    "two of the brightest known stars , @xmath8 puppis ( spectral type 04if ) and @xmath9 velorum a wolf - rayet binary are also located close to the shell on the sky .",
    "based on the symmetric location of the shell with respect to the vela ob2 association , sahu argued that this group of stars is associated with the shell .",
    "the distance estimate to vela ob2 association is @xmath10 , and this has been taken as the distance to the shell as well ( sahu , 1992 ) .",
    "the iras point source catalogue ( ipsc ) also reveals a ring - like structure , although slightly offset in position from the issa shell . from its emissivity in the infrared , and assuming the standard @xmath11 ratio of dust to gas",
    ", sahu estimated the total mass of the shell to be @xmath12 solar masses .",
    "presumably much of this mass must be in the form of molecular gas .",
    "the only evidence for this so far is restricted to the @xmath2 35 or so cometary globules in the region .",
    "these , with head - tail structures , are distributed in the region of the shell in a manner which suggests a physical association . from a comprehensive study of these globules sridharan",
    "( 1992a , b ) concluded that these small molecular clouds are expanding about a common centre with a velocity @xmath2 12 .",
    "it turns out that this centre of expansion is roughly centred on the infrared shell as delineated by the iras point sources .",
    "this strengthens the case for the cometary globules being associated with the iras vela shell .",
    "even so , this would account for only a few thousand solar masses of molecular gas since the mass of each of the globules is less than @xmath13 ( sridharan , 1992b ) .",
    "the main objective of the investigation reported in this paper was to make an extensive survey for molecular gas possibly associated with the iras shell .",
    "a second objective was to study the kinematics of this gas . for future reference",
    "we show in figure  1 a schematic of the gum - vela region , and in figure  2 the distribution of the iras point sources .",
    "in order to increase our chances of detecting molecular gas we chose a sample of point sources in the ipsc which were candidates for young stellar objects ( yso ) ; it had been noted by earlier workers that the shell - like structure in the distribution of the iras point sources was more pronounced if one restricted oneself to those which are likely to be associated with ysos .",
    "prusti ( 1992 ) , for example , used a certain `` classifier iii '' criteria to pick out the yso candidates in the ipsc .",
    "in addition to colour and statistical criteria prusti used certain `` crowding '' properties which tended to enhance the `` shell - structure '' . since the use of such a filter would excessively bias the distribution of sources selected for our survey , we used instead a less restrictive criteria used by sridharan ( 1992b ) , and which are originally due to emerson ( 1987 ) and parker ( 1988 ) .",
    "these are listed below :    1 .",
    "detection at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 > 0 $ ] .",
    "@xmath17 > 0 $ ] , if also detected at @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   detection only at @xmath15 .",
    "4 .   detection at @xmath15 and @xmath19 only with @xmath20 > 0.6 $ ] .",
    "5 .   @xmath21 > 0.$ ]    here the notation @xmath17 $ ] , for example , refers to the _ 25 to @xmath18 colour ratio _ , defined to be @xmath22 $ ] . the flux density in jansky at @xmath14",
    "is denoted by @xmath23 , etc .. we used the filter specified above on the ipsc sources in the ra range 7 hours to 9 hours which covers the shell ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "in march  april 1996 we undertook millimeter - wave observation in the @xmath24 rotational transition of the @xmath25 molecule at @xmath26 ghz . the observations were done with the 10.4 m telescope located in the campus of the raman research institute .",
    "it has an altitude - azimuth mount with the receiver at the nasmyth focus .",
    "the receiver is a schottky diode mixer cooled to 20  k. further details about the telescope and the subsystems may be found in patel ( 1990 ) .",
    "the backend used was a hybrid type correlation spectrometer configured for a bandwidth of 80  mhz with 800 channels giving a resolution of @xmath27 when using both polarizations .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity resolution of @xmath28 .",
    "the observations were done in the frequency switched mode .",
    "this had the advantage that no time is spent looking at source - free regions . moreover , since our sources were not point sources `` off - source '' regions are not well defined for beam switching schemes .",
    "a frequency offset of @xmath29 mhz was chosen between on and off spectra since that is the frequency of the observed baseline ripple . with this scheme",
    "only a polynomial fit was required to remove any residual baseline curvature .",
    "the switching rate was 2  hz . calibration was done using an ambient temperature load at intervals of several minutes .",
    "the pointing error was within @xmath30 ( as determined by observing jupiter ) .",
    "the frequency stability of the correlator was checked by observing the head of the cometary globule cg1 each day .",
    "the rms of this distribution was @xmath31 , and hence that will be the error on the velocities quoted by us .",
    "a comparison of the velocities measured by us towards the heads of several cometary globules with those measured by sridharan ( 1992b ) showed good agreement .    due to the limited observing season we selected about 100 ipsc sources out of about 3750 which satisfied the various criteria mentioned before .",
    "the sources selected for observations covered the shell although not uniformly . in addition , we observed in several directions ( within the shell ) where there were no ipsc sources .",
    "each observing run consisted of typically ten minutes of integration .",
    "the spectra in the vertical and horizontal polarizations were then averaged after removing the baseline curvature .",
    "the effective integration time was therefore typically @xmath32 minutes .",
    "the rms of the noise over such an integration period was @xmath33 . in figure",
    "3 we show a typical spectrum after correcting for the baseline curvature .",
    "the reduction of the data was done using the unipops package .",
    "the temperature scale t@xmath34 is telescope dependent but we shall not convert it to an absolute scale since in this paper we are only interested in detection ( or otherwise ) , and the velocities if molecular material is detected .",
    "we detected @xmath35 emission towards 42 of the 100 or so sources observed .",
    "table  1 lists the measured antenna    .summary of molecular detections toward iras point sources : column 1 lists the iras point source catalogue number for the source .",
