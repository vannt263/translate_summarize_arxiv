    "all correlation functions behave quite similar and a reasonable approximation is to set @xmath85 , see , e.g. , refs .   and .",
    "this simple approximation was also used in ref .   applying the rgm to antiferromagnets . however , in the antiferromagnetic regime the correlation functions carry different signs , and setting @xmath85 leads to poor results at low temperatures .",
    "a significant improvement of the rgm results for antiferromagnets can be achieved by introducing two independent vertex parameters.@xcite this requires , however , an additional external input to get one more equation . to take into account the dominant character of @xmath3 in the collinear stripe phase , we set @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "since the low - temperature properties of the model are related to excitations above the gs , a realistic description of the gs is necessary .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we use , as an additional external input , the gs sublattice magnetization calculated by the ccm.@xcite thus , describing gs magnetic ordering properly , we may expect that the rgm provides also a reasonable description of the low - temperature properties of the model .",
    "this input yields the required additional equation to determine the two independent vertex parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 at @xmath91 . as a result",

    "( [ corrlength ] ) and ( [ condens ] ) becomes exponentially small which leads to numerical instabilities .",
    "as expected , at large temperatures the concrete choice of the ratio @xmath99 becomes irrelevant , and even the simple approximation @xmath85 yields results for @xmath6 which coincide with the data from the high - temperature expansion . at low temperatures a resonable ansatz for the ratio @xmath93 should ( i ) provide numerical data down to sufficiently low temperatures and ( ii ) yield coincidence of @xmath100 determined by using the ccm input and @xmath101 calculated with the ansatz for @xmath99 .",
    "the simplest way is to fix the ratio @xmath102 to its value at @xmath91 .",
