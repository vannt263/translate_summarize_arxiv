    "the problem of quantum particles in the presence of a periodic potential and a uniform magnetic field has been the subject of intensive studies for decades .",
    "azbel @xcite was the first who pointed out that the spectral properties of two - dimensional lattice particles have a sensitive dependence on the flux through the plaquette .",
    "this observation has been exploited later by hofstadter @xcite who found the exotic structure of the one - particle energy spectrum of planar particles on square lattice in magnetic field .",
    "the same study was extended later for triangular lattice @xcite , generalized square lattices @xcite and for the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "these studies firmly established the fractal structure of the aforementioned energy spectrum , whose rich and complex nature originates from the presence of two , not necessarily commensurate periods .",
    "the first is given by the lattice structure and the second is determined by the magnetic field .",
    "the relevant parameter which determines the band structure is the ratio @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the magnetic flux per elementary plaquette , and @xmath3 is the magnetic flux quantum .    in 1994",
    "wiegmann and zabrodin pointed out @xcite that the hamiltonian responsible for the original result of hofstadter is closely related to the quantum group @xmath4 ( for mathematical treatment see @xcite ) .",
    "namely , it was shown , that the hamiltonian is expressible in terms of @xmath5 generators of quantum group @xmath0 : @xmath6 with a deformation parameter @xmath7 determined by the applied magnetic field . employing the functional representation of @xmath0 in the space of polynomials ,",
    "the harper equation was reformulated into the functional form where the one - particle eigenstates appeared as polynomials .",
    "the zeros of polynomials unambiguously specifying the one - particle wave functions were shown to be determined by the bethe ansatz equations @xcite .",
    "the fact that eigenstates are related to certain polynomials associated with the quantum group @xmath4 and with the bethe ansatz equations provides with the possibility to systematically study the structure of eigenstates .",
    "it should be noted that so far the studies were mainly concentrated on the structure of spectrum .",
    "hatsugai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the bethe ansatz equations derived in @xcite and found out that the zeros of those polynomial are not scattered randomly , but are located along concentric circles on a complex plane , thereby exhibiting nontrivial and ordered structure of eigenstates .    alongside with the eigenvalue problem on a square lattice ,",
    "the analogous problem has been considered for a honeycomb lattice as well @xcite .",
    "the common observation is that the energy spectrum differs from the one of square lattice and is equally highly nontrivial . after the connection between the quantum group @xmath0 and the problem of square lattice particles in magnetic field",
    "was found out in @xcite , the similar approach has been applied to honeycomb lattice by kohmoto and sedrakyan @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the square lattice , the honeycomb is not a bravais lattice , but consists of two interpenetrating triangular lattices ( `` @xmath8 '' and `` @xmath9 '' sublattices ) with one lattice point of each type per unit cell .",
    "therefore the one - particle hamiltonian possesses additional @xmath10-matrix structure . in terms of the generators of @xmath0",
    "it appears as h= ( 0 & i+x^- +   + i+x^+ & 0 ) and carries the anti - diagonal structure with respect to @xmath10-matrix indices .",
    "this causes certain inconvenience ( eigenvalue problem consists of two entangled equations ) which can be overcome by considering @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 since the former is diagonal in @xmath10-matrix indices . taking advantage of this observation",
    ", the authors of @xcite obtained the analogue of the bethe ansatz equation derived for square lattice in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) describes particle hoppings from a site to the three nearest neighboring ones . the squared operator @xmath11 contains second - order terms describing double - hoppings @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "as a result , the bethe - like equations derived in @xcite look quite cumbersome , and the nesting procedure has been applied with the aim to reduce them to the set of simpler equations .    in this paper",
    "we develop the distinct approach to the eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian ( 1 ) by revealing its novel symmetry .",
    "this symmetry allows to carry out certain analytic calculations right for @xmath12 with no necessity of involving @xmath11 .",
    "based on this symmetry we reduce the system of entangled equations to a single equation thus avoiding the necessity of involving @xmath11 .",
    "the obtained single equation corresponds to the elementary hoppings @xmath15 and appears perceptibly simpler than the one derived in @xcite from @xmath11 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the forthcoming section we comment on the derivation of one - particle hamiltonian from the tight - binding model on honeycomb lattice in magnetic field . in section iii",
    "we rewrite this hamiltonian in terms of the quantum group @xmath0 and discuss the representations of @xmath0 . section iv deals with harper equation in polynomial representation .",
    "since the honeycomb consists of two triangle bravais sublattices , the harper equation appears in the form of the system of two entangled equations .",
    "this system is shown to possess certain type of symmetry which permits to decouple them and to obtain a single equation describing the elementary process of nearest neighbouring hopping .",
    "solutions to this equation are polynomials with real coefficients and bethe - like equations determining the zeros of polynomials are derived . in section v the results of numeric analysis are presented and the locations of zeros in the complex plane are depicted exhibiting nontrivial and ordered structure of eigenstates .",
    "honeycomb lattice is built up of two - dimensional array of hexagonal unit cells of the side @xmath16 , with atoms at the vertices .",
    "such a structure is encountered in solid state physics in various crystals , while the ideal realization of the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice is graphene @xcite .",
    "the unit cell is a rhombus of the side @xmath17 with angles @xmath18 and @xmath19 at its vertices .",
    "each unit cell consists of two atoms , @xmath8 and @xmath9 as indicated in figure 1 .",

    "note that particular values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not affect the structure ( 12 ) .      for every complex @xmath53 the quantum group @xmath0 possesses the highest weight representations analogous to those of ordinary @xmath50 .",

    "these states form the orthonormal complete set @xmath56 and can be used as a basis in the space of representation .",
    "the action of matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 on the states ( 14 ) is expressed by the following relations @xmath59 where the cyclic identification @xmath60 is understood in ( 16c ) and ( 16d ) .",

    "we find @xmath62 where t_j = e^+k_xaq^j-12+e^-k_xaq^-j+12 .",
    "due to ( 17a ) and ( 17b ) the operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be regarded as rising and lowering ones respectively .    from ( 17a ) and ( 17b ) we find x^=q^12ne^n3k_ya(t_1t_2t_n ) .    for those values of @xmath65",
    "when @xmath66 for any @xmath67 , the operators @xmath5 possess only nonvanishing eigenvalues . in other words , there is neither highest nor lowest weight states . hence ( 8) and ( 13 ) form the cyclic representation of ( 12 ) .",
    "acting on @xmath68 by @xmath63 we obtain @xmath69 , and so on until we arrive to @xmath70 .",

    "e.g. _ setting @xmath74 we find @xmath75 .",
    "then ( 17a ) and ( 17b ) yield @xmath76 and @xmath77 so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 appear as the highest and the lowest weight vectors respectively .",
    "the important comment is in order : manipulating with quasi - momentum , the cyclic and the highest weight representations can be transformed one into another .",
    "such an interplay has been known for a long time @xcite .",

    "introduce the interpolating function of the complex variable @xmath84 such that f_n = f(e^-3k_yaq^n-12 ) .",
    "then the relations ( 20 ) can be written as @xmath85 these relations determine the functional representation of @xmath0 .",
    "functional representation for the odd values of @xmath39 is constructed in appendix b.",
    "we study the eigenvalue equation 0 & i+x^- ( ) +   + i+x^+ ( ) & 0 +   + = e +   + .    employing the functional representation ( 22 ) the eigenvalue equation ( 23 )",
    "can be rewritten in the form of two coupled equations @xmath86 if any pair @xmath87 is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath88 , then the pair @xmath89 is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath90 .",
    "the main disadvantage of ( 24 ) is the entanglement of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this difficulty has been overcome in @xcite by `` squaring up '' the equations ( 23 ) : repeated application of @xmath12 to ( 23 ) gives out @xmath93 and @xmath94 which in the functional representation appear as    @xmath95    due to the `` square up '' trick some portion of information encoded in ( 24 ) is lost in ( 25 ) .",
    "here we propose essentially different approach allowing to avoid this drawback ( disadvantage ) of the `` square up '' procedure .",
    "the key point of our consideration is the observation , that the system ( 24 ) is invariant under the following transformation @xmath96 where the parameter @xmath97 is set by @xmath98 .",
    "this symmetry allows to express the solutions to ( 24 ) as ( z ) +   + ( z)=f(z ) +   + ( iz)^f(-z^-1)where @xmath84 satisfies the equation @xmath99 the signs `` @xmath100 '' in ( 27 ) correspond to @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "we have thus reduced the system of equations ( 24 ) to a single equation ( 28 ) while @xmath91 and @xmath92 are now expressed via the unique function @xmath84 . in appendix c",
    "we show that the system of equations ( 25 ) appears as a corollary of ( 28 ) meaning that the later is the basic equation relevant to the problem under consideration .",
    "we proceed to study the equation ( 28 ) at special values of momenta reducing the functional representation to the polynomial one .",
    "consider the monomials @xmath102 forming the basis in the space of analytic functions .",
    "we then find @xmath103 where @xmath104 has been defined by ( 18 ) .",
    "setting @xmath105 we find @xmath106 yielding that the subspace of @xmath107th order polynomials @xmath108 is the invariant subspace of the group @xmath0 .",
    "then the equations ( 24 ) appear as @xmath109 and admit the solutions in the form of @xmath107th order polynomials .",
    "these polynomials are real , _",
    "i.e. _ with real coefficients",
    ". this statement can be verified by expanding @xmath91 and @xmath92 in a series of @xmath110 and rewriting ( 30 ) for the expansion coefficients .",
    "the invariance ( 26 ) holds for ( 30 ) provided @xmath111 while the equation ( 28 ) turns into f(z)+iqzf(qz)-iq^-1zf(q^-1z)=(-1)^jz^2jf(-z^-1 ) , generating @xmath40 eigenvalues @xmath112 .",
    "the factor of @xmath113 can be absorbed in @xmath114 and therefore we may drop it in what follows .",
    "the equation ( 31 ) is derived for @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath116 we come to the similar functional equation , but with the deformation parameter @xmath117 instead of @xmath7 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "therefore , provided @xmath118 and @xmath116 we have @xmath119 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath120 . for that reason below",
    "we discuss only @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath84 is a polynomial we can write down f(z)=_j=1 ^ 2j(z - z_j ) , where @xmath121 are the zeros of @xmath84 .    substituting ( 32 ) into ( 31 ) and taking @xmath122 we obtain iz_n=_j=1 ^ 2j-_j=1 ^ 2j , which is the honeycomb analog of the bethe ansatz equation obtained in @xcite for square lattice . due to the fact that ( 30 ) is soluble in terms of real polynomials , the solutions to the equation ( 31 ) are also real polynomials .",
    "correspondingly , if @xmath123 is a root then @xmath124 must be the root as well .",
    "this comes in agreement with the invariance of ( 33 ) under the complex conjugation .    rewriting ( 31 ) as = _",
    "j=1 ^ 2j + iqz_j=1 ^ 2j -_j=1 ^ 2j , and taking the limit @xmath125 we find = _",
    "j=1 ^ 2jz_j -z_j=1 ^ 2jz_j+o(z^2 ) , where the right hand side must be @xmath126-independent . then = _",
    "j=1 ^ 2jz_j and",
    "_ j=1 ^ 2j(z_j+)=iq+ .",
    "the analogous `` sum rule '' does exist in the case of the square lattice .",
    "namely , the functional relation derived in @xcite leads to _ j=1",
    "^ 2j(z_j+)=0 , where @xmath127 are the zeros of the square lattice polynomials .    taking now the limit @xmath128 in ( 34 ) we find ^2=1+i(q - q^-1)_j=1 ^ 2jz_j+o ( ) , where again the right hand side is @xmath126-independent yielding ^2=1+i(q - q^-1)_j=1 ^ 2jz_j .    using ( 37 ) we can rewrite ( 40 ) also as ^2=3-q^2-q^-2-i(q - q^-1)_j=1 ^ 2j .",
    "we have thus derived the relation among an eigenvalue and the roots of the corresponding polynomial .",
    "the set of roots is determined by ( 33 ) .",
    "once the roots of a polynomial are known , the corresponding eigenvalue can be calculated using any of ( 36 ) , ( 40 ) , ( 41 ) .",
    "remark that the aforementioned invariance of ( 30 ) may be interpreted in terms of special conformal transformation zw = w(z)=- . under this conformal map",
    "a quasi - primary field @xmath129 transforms as ( z)(w)=()^-h(z ) where @xmath130 is the corresponding conformal weight @xcite .    taking @xmath131 and expressing non - primed fields via the primed ones we find @xmath132 using ( 44 ) and rewriting the systems ( 30 ) in terms of primed fields we obtain @xmath133 hence",

    "few points are deviated from the straight lines , what can be explained by relatively small value of @xmath40 . passing to @xmath142 of less magnitude the roots regroup from the straight lines into a circle ( figure 3b ) which subsequently transforms into a hexagon ( figure 3c ) for the eigenvalue of minimal magnitude .",
