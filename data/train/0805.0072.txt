    "the electrodynamics in the magnetosphere of a neutron star has not yet been well understood , although fascinating phenomena as revealed in emissions across the whole electromagetic spectrum from neutron stars have been observed for forty years . among the 2000 or so radio pulsars cataloged to date ,",
    "only 7 are detected at photon energies higher than 100 mev and 3 more are detected at a lower confidence level @xcite .",
    "these 7 include geminga , which does not emit radio waves or emits only at a very low level @xcite .",
    "the effort to understand gamma - ray emissions from pulsars has resulted in two types of models : the slot - gap models @xcite and the outer - gap models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these models , although different in the assumed emission site and mechanisms , have been successful in many aspects in explaining the pulse profiles and spectra . however , they do give different estimates of the fraction of radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars , like geminga , among all the gamma - ray pulsars @xcite . a gamma - ray pulsar",
    "may be radio - quiet if its gamma - ray beam is wider than its radio beam or these beams are in different directions .",
    "it is also possible that it is intrinsically weak in radio emission because of unfavored spin periods and magnetic field strength .",
    "although a consistent model for radio emission from pulsars is still lacking , several empirical models are available . given a radio emission model ( e.g. @xcite ) , different models for gamma - ray pulsars may be discriminated by comparing their estimates of the radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsar fraction with observations , in addition to comparing their prediction of high - energy emission polarization characteristics ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the number of currently known gamma - ray pulsars is only 7 , which is obviously too small to give a meaningful fraction of the radio - quiet ones . with the launch of glast and agile",
    ", the number of gamma - ray pulsars is expected to increase significantly .",
    "however , radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars may still be difficult to find , mainly because of the limited amount of gamma - ray photons . just like the case of geminga",
    ", only after its period was discovered in the rosat data @xcite , its pulsation in gamma - rays was then found .",
    "very often it is also difficult to find the period in x - ray data , particularly when the data is sparse and a blind search over a large range of periods is performed .",
    "efforts to find new radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars from unidentified egret sources in a multiwavelength approach have not yet yielded definite results ( e.g.   @xcite ) . among the unidentified egret sources , many are at low galactic latitude and may be gamma - ray pulsars . continuing this effort",
    ", we conducted a periodicity search for possible x - ray counterparts to some bright unidentified egret sources , using all available archival data with the method of cross - checking two data sets to look for candidate periods .",
    "the purpose of this cross - checking procedure is to find relatively significant signatures of possible pulsations occurring in two independent data sets .",
    "candidate periods and the corresponding period time derivatives thus found are reported and can serve as the target periods to verify in future x - ray or gamma - ray data .",
    "as an effort to understand the nature of unidentified egret sources , @xcite presented a catalog of 2 - 10 kev asca / gis images of fields containing 30 bright gev sources .",
    "these gev sources were selected from the brightest ones in the catalog compiled by @xcite using only photons with energies above 1 gev from the egret public archives that incorporate the first 4.5 yr of cgro / egret observations . among these gev sources ,",
    "some are identified pulsars and quasars , some are possible counterparts to previously known objects , and the others are not yet identified to sources in other energy bands .",
    "possible x - ray counterparts of these unidentified gev sources were proposed in @xcite . to search for new radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars , we look for periodicity of possible x - ray counterparts to those unidentified gev sources for which the possibility of being gamma - ray pulsars has not yet been ruled out .",
    "furthermore , as explained in the next section , two data sets adequate for timing analysis are needed for the cross - checking method to find candidate periods .",
    "6 gev sources among the 30 in the catalog of @xcite were thus selected .",
    "one of the 6 sources ( gev j1417 - 6100 ) has four potential x - ray counterparts .",
    "another one of the 6 sources ( gev j0008 + 7304 ) has been investigated with the same procedure described in this paper .",
    "the periodicity search result of its possible x - ray counterpart , rx j0007.0 + 7302 , was reported by @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the 8 x - ray sources and their data used in this study are listed in table  [ data ] .",
    "detailed descriptions of each gev sources can be found in @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ pcan ]    in data set 07 , the candidate period of ax j1418.76058 at 0.10171064 s has an @xmath0-value of 56.7 , which has a very low random probability for a single trial . with our procedure",
    ", there will be candidate periods satisfying our criteria in all the data sets 08 , 09 , and 10 .",
    "here we only report the most significant one .",
    "its random probability listed in table [ pcan ] was derived using an @xmath0-value equal to 50 instead of 56.7 , since in @xcite the signle trial random probability was provided only up to @xmath0 equal to 50 .",
    "two similar cases are the candidate period at 0.014799899 s for ax j1420.16049 , which has an @xmath0-value of 53.8 in data set 14 , and that at 0.13247455 s for ax j1809.82332 , which has an @xmath0-value of 59.5 in data set 15 .",
    "although in our procedure only the most prominent feature in the cross - checking window is picked out for association , for the candidate period of ax j1418.76058 at 0.10139550 sec in data set 07 , the association with the period of the second highest @xmath0-value in the cross - checking window of data set 09 is also reported here , since it is very close to the candidate period in data set 07 and its @xmath0-value is not too different from the highest .",
    "that association is shown in figure  [ asso3 ] .",
    "= 8.4 cm    the two candidate periods of ax j1809.82332 listed in table [ pcan ] are related to each other . based on their pulse profiles",
    "we suggest the period at 0.13247455 s be the second harmonic of the one at 0.264949 s if they are real .",
    "in such a case , the derived period derivative , characteristic age and spin - down power for the association between periodicity signatures found in data sets 15 and 17 near 0.1325 s will be 2 , 1 and 0.25 times those listed in table [ pcan ] respectively .",
    "it makes this association even more unfavoured if one compares its spin - down power with that of the crab pulsar ; see discussion in the next section . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong periodicity signature ( figure  [ hdis1809 ] ) makes the candidate period at 0.264949 s very tempting .",
    "= 8.4 cm    to examine whether the procedure described above is useful , we applied it to the case of rx j1856.53754 , whose x - ray emission is believed to be thermal emission from the surface of a neutron star .",
    "there were several xmm observations of that source , but no periodicity was found until a period of 7.055 s with a random probability of @xmath1 was reported by @xcite .",
    "that result was obtained by analysing the xmm data taken in october 2006 . applying our cross - checking method as described above to previous data",
    ", we found that the 7-s period was also picked out and suggested as a candidate period .",
    "it demonstrates , although not guarantees , the usefulness of our cross - checking method .",
    "we applied the periodicity cross - checking procedure described in section 3 to the 8 x - ray sources listed in table  [ data ] .",
    "candidate periods obtained with this method are listed in table  [ pcan ] .",
    "future periodicity searches at x - rays or gamma - rays may be conducted around these candidate periods , instead of performing blind searches . among all these candidate periods ,",
    "the one with the lowest random probability ( 4.1@xmath2 ) is 145.2297 ms for ax j1420.1 - 6049 .",
    "its implied characteristic age , 4800 years , is between that of the crab pulsar and of the vela pulsar .",
    "however , its corresponding spin - down power is similar to that of the vela pulsar , which in turn is about 100 times smaller than that of the crab .",
    "if there is a correlation between the characteristic age and the spin - down power , this candidate period is not favoured because its associated spin - down power is too small for its 4800-year characteristic age .    indeed , among the currently known gamma - ray pulsars , the spin - down power decreases with increasing characteristic ages .",
    "the crab pulsar , with a characteristic age of @xmath3 years , has a spin - down power about @xmath4 erg / s .",
    "that of the vela pulsar are @xmath5 years and @xmath6 erg / s and of geminga are @xmath7 years and @xmath8 erg / s .",
    "one possible way to further assess the reality of these candidate periods , therefore , is to compare their corresponding properties , such as the characteristic age and the spin - down power , with that of known gamma - ray pulsars . along this line of thinking ,",
    "the candidate periods at 203 ms for ax j1418.2 - 6047 , at 159 ms for ax j1418.6 - 6045 , at 19.6 ms and 145 ms for ax j1420.1 - 6049 , and at 22.4 ms , 33.5 ms and 168 ms for ax j1836.2 + 5928 are favoured , since their corresponding characteristic ages and spin - down powers are roughly consistent with that of known gamma - ray pulsars .    another property to consider is the x - ray to gamma - ray energy spectral index , defined in @xcite , which assumes an x - ray counterpart to those unidentified gev sources and leads to three x - ray brightness categories for the gev sources under study . in that scheme , the crab pulsar is x - ray bright , the vela pulsar is x - ray moderate , and geminga is x - ray faint .",
    "the gev sources associated with the aforementioned x - ray sources are all x - ray moderate ( similar to vela ) , except for gev j1835 + 5921 , which is x - ray faint ( similar to geminga ) .",
    "examing the characteristic ages , we note that the four candidate periods at 203 ms for ax j1418.2 - 6047 , at 159 ms for ax j1418.6 - 6045 , at 145 ms for ax j1420.1 - 6049 and at 168 ms for ax j1836.2 + 5928 survive the comparison .",
    "the candidate period at 127.5 ms for rx j0007.0 + 7302 reported by @xcite is also supported by these comparisons .",
    "these five x - ray sources are possible counterparts to three ( or four ) gev sources , namely , gev j0008 + 7304 , gev j14176100 ( or a probable separate source 3eg j14206038 ) , and gev j1835 + 5921 . for the former two ( or three )",
    ", if the candidate periods suggested here turn out to be true , they will be more vela - like , in terms of timing properties .",
    "it would suggest that the major cause for a gamma - ray pulsar to be radio quiet is likely geometrical , rather than intrinsic , and the gamma - ray beam is wider than the radio one so that for a certain viewing angle both the radio and gamma - ray emissions are observed , as for the case of vela , and in another viewing angle only the gamma - ray emission is observed . instead , if all the radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars are similar to geminga in their timing properties , the cause of being radio quiet , although not yet clear , is probably intrinsic .",
    "timing properties of not - yet - discovered gamma - ray pulsars may not be similar to the known ones , particularly because the number of the latter is still small .",
    "all the candidate periods listed in table  [ pcan ] may therefore still be helpful for pinning down the periodicity of emissions from these sources in the future when new x - ray data or gamma - ray data obtained with agile and glast become available . a larger sample of gamma - ray pulsars , either radio loud or quiet , will help us to understand better the radiation mechanisms in the magnetospheres of gamma - ray pulsars .",
